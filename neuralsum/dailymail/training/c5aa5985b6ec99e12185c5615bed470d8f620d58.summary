finance worker mr @entity10 , 44 , said : ' three police officers knocked on my front door saying they had to search the premises			1
' they said it was about the student who was living with us after they caught him filming children in @entity24 and they left with his computer			2
' when we found out he was a convicted sex offender we all felt disgusted			0
i have two young boys and it ’s scary to think he was living with them for three months			0
' mr @entity10 and his wife , aged 43 , were paid £ 260 a month to host students for the @entity52 in @entity24			1
they worked with the firm for 14 years and hosted more than 50 students , saying the work was less about the money - which has to cover a full @entity59 service - and more about helping the community			2
mr @entity10 added : ' the language school @entity61 ( @entity61 ) check all the host families			1
' but this guy was n't @entity61 checked and was allowed to live in our house with our children ... it 's disgraceful			2
appalled : @entity10 and @entity68 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , have been hosting language students for 14 years and both of them have been subjected to several @entity61 ( @entity61 ) checks ' they have n’t given us so much as an apology and have just said it ’s the first time it ’s ever happened			1
' but if they ’re not checking students ’ backgrounds how many others do they not know about ? ' mr @entity10 continued : ' he was due to stay with us until august and i dread to think what could have happened if he ’d not been caught			2

' no vetting required ' : the language school , based in this street in @entity24 , said it complied with the law ' he seemed like a nice enough guy , kept himself to himself , so we never would have thought he ’d do something like this			1
' @entity1 's offences in the @entity15 were also believed to involve indecent images			1
