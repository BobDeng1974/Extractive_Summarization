by @entity1 reporter published : 20:55 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 08:50 est , 5 november 2013 as the beleaguered @entity3 searches for help out of its deep economic holes , voters seem prepared to shake things up tuesday by electing the first white mayor in 40 years			1
former healthcare executive @entity8 , 55 , is known for pulling @entity3 's hospital system from the brink of bankruptcy and the 82 percent black city is poised to choose him over their history of choosing a mayor who looks like they do			1
if @entity8 beats his @entity20 - @entity19 opponent , @entity21 sheriff @entity18 , it will be a first since @entity22 set a new precedent as the city 's first black mayor in 1974			1
and the win appears likely			0
a poll released last week showed @entity18 lagging well behind @entity8 , who also holds an almost 3 - to - 1 fundraising and spending edge			2
' the @entity30 ' : @entity8 , the leader of beleaguered @entity3 's mayoral race , would become the city 's first white mayor since 1974 if he 's elected tomorrow though @entity8 , who is a recent transplant to @entity3 , is somewhat of an outsider , even a leader of black nationalist group new @entity38 supports him			1
' in the last two national elections , @entity20 have asked the nation to choose the best person for the job and not get caught up in colour			0
and twice , @entity44 has won , ' said @entity45 , who 's known for leading provocitve protests and calls to violence against the white establishment			0
' now , in @entity3 , in 2013 , the best man running is a white brother , and that ’s ok , ' he said			0
@entity8 's rise to prominence has been anything but typical			0
history : @entity3 , an 82 percent black city , has a 40 year history of electing a mayor who looks like they do @entity8 would become the first white man to lead the city in 40 years			1
here , the last four leaders of the @entity3 are current mayor @entity63 ( top left ) ; @entity65 , who was elected in 2008 ( top right ) ; former mayor @entity67 , who is now serving a 28 year prison sentence for corruption charges ( bottom left ) ; and former mayor @entity71 ( bottom right ) only recently moved to @entity3 from the outlying suburb of @entity73 and even face pushback over his residency in the city during the primary			1
but instead of throwing in the towel , the former hospital executive mounted a write - in campaign and beat sheriff @entity18 by 20,000 votes			1
both @entity83 have now advanced to the general election , which takes place tuesday			2
' a major part of why i have so much support is that everyone in the city understands that if you ’re broke , you ca n’t deliver any services , ' @entity8 recently told the @entity93			0
' so i think there is a strong feeling in the city that we need a mayor who can balance the budget and operate the city well financially			0
' trailblazer : @entity22 became @entity3 's first black mayor in 1974 and led the city for the next 20 years only , regardless of who the winner is , the next mayor of the city that became @entity19 's largest to ever file for bankruptcy in july will have very little power			1
@entity3 is being guided through the filing by a state - appointed emergency manager , who must ok any requests for money made by the mayor			2
' i think they 're kidding themselves if they think they are going to regain financial control of this city , ' said @entity3 - based bankruptcy attorney @entity119			2
' even after @entity121 , there will be a financial advisory board that will maintain control of the city 's finances indefinitely			0
the first part for any new mayor is to accept that and work with the state on how to right this city 's finances			0

over *80* percent black , @entity3 has elected only black men to lead its city since @entity22 's 20 years on the job began in the 1970s
@entity8 made it to the general election after winning the august primary as a write - in *candidate* by 20,000 votes
even new @entity38 leader @entity45 has endorsed @entity8
