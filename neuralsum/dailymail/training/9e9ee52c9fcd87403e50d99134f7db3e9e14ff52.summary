by @entity0 for the @entity1 large parts of golfing @entity3 might still be in denial but @entity5 spelt out the facts regarding long - time superstars @entity8 and @entity9 in characteristically candid terms on wednesday			1
asked about the absence of both from the field who will contest the season - ending @entity15 here at @entity17 for the first time since 1992 , @entity5 responded : ‘ i do n’t know if i would say their era is over but it is a fact they ’re getting older and playing the last few holes of their careers			1
’ @entity5 speaks to the media at @entity17 in @entity27 on wednesday how @entity5 or @entity28 could win the $ 10 million @entity30 bonus … @entity5 will claim that sum if he wins the @entity15 — not to mention the $ 1.44m first prize — and has a reasonable chance if he finishes second			1
a slim chance if he finishes as low as tied third			2
@entity28 must win the @entity15 and hope @entity39 finishes worse than 21st , @entity38 worse than sixth , @entity35 worse than fourth , and @entity5 , @entity36 and @entity37 are outside the top three			1
by the same token , the new poster boy is stepping up to the plate nicely with a very tidy front nine			2
this season @entity5 has played 16 events that count on the @entity46 and registered three wins , eight other top 10s and never once finished outside the top 25			1
he can reflect on a year where he not only won two majors but also addressed the vexed issue of his inconsistency			2
now comes the chance to add a little stardust			2
if he wins this event , with its $ 1.44million ( £ 890,000 ) first prize , he will also collect the $ 10m ( £ 6.18m ) bonus for the @entity58			1
@entity5 caused a few wry chuckles when he described it initially as a ‘ nice bit of extra money ’			1
it made you wonder what would be a considerable sum , before he elaborated			2
‘ it is obviously a lot of money to anyone , but i have been lucky enough to make a lot of money on the @entity46 , ’ he said			1
‘ one of the few things i have n’t achieved is a @entity58 , so that ’s the real reason i want to win this week			1
@entity5 has his sights set on the @entity76 and $ 10m bonus ‘ i just want to finish the year off well			1
yes , the money is great , but the title would mean more to me , and after the year i ’ve had it would be disappointing not to pull it off			0
i ’ve only got 28 other players to beat here			0
it ’s not like a regular event where you have to beat 155			0
’ @entity5 , 25 , rounded off his time in @entity86 last week with a visit to @entity88 to watch a little @entity3 football in the shape of the @entity91 against the @entity92			1
he spent time down on the field and came away sounding like he was glad he played golf for a living			2
‘ wow , there are some big boys who play that game , ’ he said , shaking his head			0
it ’s no surprise to me that two or three guys a game get injured			0
some of the wide receivers and the running backs are amazing			0
to my mind , they ’re the most impressive athletes in sport			0
you have to have it all in that game			0
’ @entity5 signs autographs during a practice round in @entity27 the following morning , he was due to fly to @entity27 before having a last - minute change of heart , a re-routing to south @entity117 and a night at home for the first time in two months			1
‘ it really is amazing what a night in your own bed can do , ’ he said			0
‘ i stood in the shower in @entity86 and said to myself , “ why am i going to @entity27 today ? ” so i got to dump a little luggage that i have been carrying with me the past few weeks , practise at the @entity127 nearby and work out at home in the gym			2
it was a lovely , relaxing day and i come here feeling refreshed			0
’ if he feels that way after a night in his own bed , @entity133 ’s @entity132 captain @entity131 must be hoping he opts for seven days at home next week before heading off to @entity136 , where his workload will almost certainly include five matches			0
@entity8 ( above ) and @entity9 ( below ) will not be in @entity27 this week as for his practice session , did he work on his putting by any chance ? ‘ yes , and there were no four putts either , ’ he said , smiling , in reference to four - putting the same hole two days running at the @entity145 last week			1
‘ it was just a complete anomaly			0
i can see where i lost concentration on the third putt on saturday , but on sunday i grinded on all of them			0
you just have to write it off as one of those things and hopefully there will be no more this week			0
’ the other @entity156 representative here is @entity28 , who can also claim the $ 10m bonus but only if a complex sequence of events goes his way			1
‘ i quite like being one of the dark horses because the pressure is on the top guys to finish the job off , ’ he argued			2
‘ i can just go for it , with nothing to lose			0
’ even if he does n’t pull it off , there ’s still plenty of @entity30 loot to play for , with even the man who finishes fifth in the bonus pool collecting more than $ 1m			1
a nice bit of extra money , by any standard .			0

@entity5 targeting @entity58 and $ 10m ( £ 6.18m ) bonus
he has three wins and eight top 10 finishes on @entity46 this season
