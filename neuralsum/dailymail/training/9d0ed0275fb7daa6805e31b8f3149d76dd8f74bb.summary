by @entity0 published : 20:03 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 02:48 est , 13 february 2013 dangerous : @entity2 @entity1 , who last week delivered a report on the scandal at @entity6 hospitals , said healthcare assistants have only ' a few hours training ' before being ¿ let loose ¿ on patients hospital staff caring for the most vulnerable patients have less training for their job and face fewer checks than bouncers or minicab drivers , an expert warned yesterday			1
@entity1 said healthcare assistants have only ‘ a few hours training ’ before being ‘ let loose ’ on patients			1
the @entity2 warned there was nothing to stop a worker found totally unfit at one hospital being employed by another			1
last week mr @entity1 delivered a damning report into the scandal at @entity6 hospitals , where hundreds died because of poor care			1
but he warned that failings in the @entity31 meant the disaster could well be repeated in other hospitals			1
he urged the @entity34 to make a number of key changes to improve care and ensure hospitals and staff are rigorously checked			0
they included making healthcare assistants undergo basic training before allowing them on wards			1
there are around 300,000 of these staff – also known as healthcare support workers – in the @entity31			1
they are mainly responsible for basic care , including feeding , washing and dressing patients , yet most have no medical qualifications or training			0
and , because they are not regulated by a watchdog , they can not be barred from working even if found guilty of appalling lapses			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ someone who is allowed to provide direct physical care for any patient , let alone highly vulnerable people who can not speak for themselves , should be the subject of at least some record			2
‘ it seems strange to me that there is more regulation for nightclub doormen and minicab drivers than healthcare support workers			2
a healthcare assistant who is found totally unfit at one hospital can walk down the road and get a job at another , and nobody needs to know about what happens in the other place			1
’ giving evidence to mps at the health select committee , he added : ‘ the amount of training before they are let loose on patients can be as little as a few hours			2
i was concerned to find there seemed to be no consistency at all for this grade of work			0
‘ they should have to have some record of who they are , how you can get hold of them , where they are employed and if they no longer work there then why not			0
everyone talks about basic care as if it is something very easy			0
we need some training standards			0
they do n’t need to be very complicated but we do need to test people ’s aptitude			0
’ the @entity105 has repeatedly warned the lack of training for healthcare support workers is putting patients at risk			1
repeat warning : mr @entity1 warned that failings in the @entity31 meant the @entity6 disaster could well be repeated in other hospitals last month its general secretary dr @entity113 said most of these workers were just picking it up as they went along			1
he said : ‘ if you walk into a ward for older people , this is where you find most of the problems , most of the staff nowadays are not nurses ; they are healthcare assistants			2
‘ there ’s nothing wrong with healthcare assistants providing they have had a proper training and education , but in far too many cases they ’ve not had as much as an hour of training			1
‘ who can understand a situation where you employ someone , put a uniform on them so they look like a nurse , put them on to a ward or in a care home , and the mindset is : “ you pick it up as you go along ” ? ’ healthcare assistants wear similar tunics to nurses and can be distinguished only by the title on their name badges			2
some earn just £ 7 an hour – less than a cleaner bouncers have to undergo training and sit an exam before they can gain the licence that allows them to work			0
they must prove they can confiscate drugs , cope with a medical emergency and deal with drunken revellers			0
minicab drivers must hold a clean driving licence and have to sit a 40 - minute written test set by their local council			0
they must also go to a gp for a medical .			0
