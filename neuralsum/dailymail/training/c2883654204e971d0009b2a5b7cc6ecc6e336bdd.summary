by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:37 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 04:31 est , 6 december 2013 @entity3 's burgeoning economic recovery will see house prices roar back to life , adding more than a quarter to the value of the average home in the next five years , according to official forecasts yesterday			1
a confident chancellor @entity9 declared @entity3 back on track thanks to the government ’s economic plan , with growth set to more than double this year in the biggest upgrade for 14 years			1
@entity15 insisted that many families were still being squeezed , with increases in the cost of living set to outstrip wages until 2014 or 2015			1
other critics warned of the dangers of a recovery built on a housing price boom and increased household debt			2
smile when you 're winning : chancellor of the exchequer @entity9 in the @entity27 yesterday but there was little doubt that yesterday was a triumphant moment for mr @entity9 , whose @entity31 left a red - faced shadow chancellor @entity32 floundering and facing damaging sniping from his own side			1
@entity36 prices are expected to rise by a ‘ stronger than expected ’ 5.2 per cent on average next year , another 7.2 per cent in 2015 , and will be 10 per cent higher by 2018 than previously predicted – delighting homeowners , but raising concerns about another housing bubble and the potential for interest rate rises as soon as 2015			1
the boom will add about £ 45,000 to the value of a typical home between now and 2018 , but mr @entity9 pointed out prices would still be 3 per cent lower in real terms than they were before the credit crunch started in 2007			1
yesterday , economic growth forecasts were more than doubled by the independent @entity49 ( @entity49 ) to 1.4 per cent for this year and 2.4 per cent in 2014			1
‘ @entity3 ’s economic plan is working , ’ mr @entity9 told the @entity27 , saying the @entity3 was expanding faster than any other advanced economy			1
‘ it ’s a serious plan for a grown - up country			2
but the job is not done			2
by doing the right thing we are heading in the right direction			2
@entity3 is moving again : let ’s keep going			2
’ hailing the ‘ sacrifice and endeavour ’ of the @entity3 people , he said @entity15 had been proved ‘ comprehensively wrong ’ for insisting there would be no return to growth until public spending taps were turned back on			1
in a deeply political statement , mr @entity9 said he would tighten the rules for tackling the budget deficit			2
@entity3 should run a ‘ small cash surplus ’ by 2018 , he told @entity70 , revealing that a new ‘ charter for budgetary responsibility ’ would be put to a @entity27 vote just months before the next general election			0
it would mean that once the public finances return to the red , the cash will have to be used to help pay down debt			0
in only 11 of the 65 years since 1948 has the @entity3 government recorded a surplus , now forecast for 2018			0
mr @entity9 insisted the government ’s welfare squeeze must continue , also challenging @entity15 to sign up to a new , permanent cap on most benefit spending before 2015			1
the chancellor ’s plans were calculated to box @entity15 in , leaving the opposition open to charges of fiscal irresponsibility if it refuses to back the government ’s proposals			1
the @entity49 said that by 2018 , when it expects the budget to be in surplus , the government ’s ‘ consumption of goods and services ’ – essentially day - to - day spending on public services and bureaucracy – will have fallen to its smallest share of national income since 1948			0
other key measures and forecasts in yesterday ’s statement included : * a boost for business , with employers ’ @entity110 scrapped for workers under 21 and business rates capped			0
* unemployment to fall from 7.6 per cent this year to 7 per cent in 2015 and 5.6 per cent by 2018			1
* a permanent new welfare cap , to take effect from 2015 , and a requirement for jobless youngsters to undertake training or work experience			0
* next year ’s planned 2p increase in petrol tax scrapped , and rail ticket rises capped at inflation			1
* average household energy bills to fall by £ 50 as green levies are scaled back			1
* future state pension age increases accelerated to save a further £ 400billion over the next 50 years			0
* free school meals for children in reception , year one and two			1
* a new £ 200 tax break for married couples , which will be uprated in line with the personal tax allowance			0
@entity15 insisted that the rosy economic figures did not alter the fact that many people were experiencing a ‘ cost of living crisis ’			1
chancellor @entity9 's @entity139 , a @entity141 , entering @entity142 it looks like the new top dog at @entity145 is already taking her duties very seriously ... @entity148 , @entity9 ’s bichon frise , made her first public appearance yesterday – perhaps to give the chancellor some moral support			0
the puppy , introduced on @entity154 at the weekend , was carried into no 11 by an aide			0
it remains to be seen how the canine addition to @entity145 will get on with @entity159 's cat @entity160 who arrived in 2011 to help deal with no 10 's rat problem			0
the @entity49 said earnings would not start to outstrip inflation until either next year or 2015 , depending on which measure of inflation is used			2
it also suggested the recovery is still unbalanced , and there was a potential for growth to slow before the next election			2
mr @entity32 , who struggled to make himself heard above @entity174 jeers , said : ‘ for all his complacent boasts , for three damaging and wasted years , for most people there is no recovery at all			0
’ he insisted that despite the chancellor ’s ‘ smoke and mirrors ’ , the government was borrowing £ 198billion more than it planned in 2010			0
@entity183 business secretary @entity183 said there was ‘ clearly still a danger of house prices getting out of control ’ , and cast doubts on parts of the chancellor ’s flagship help to buy scheme , which helps people with small deposits get mortgages on houses worth up to £ 600,000			1
‘ it ’s very difficult for people on middle incomes to get into the housing market without the bank of mum and dad			0
and the danger is if you fuel demand , then prices are driven up even more , ’ he said			2
mr @entity32 insisted that despite the chancellor ¿ s @entity208 , the @entity180 was borrowing £ 198billion more than it planned in 2010 ‘ the key is to build more houses			0
we are beginning to see a big upsurge in construction			0
but we need an awful lot more			0
’ the dramatic recovery in the housing market also looks set to swell @entity219 coffers , with stamp duty receipts set to almost double from £ 8.9billion this year to £ 16.8billion in 2018 - 19			1
the forecasts are likely to cause unease at the @entity223 where officials are worried about prices spiralling out of control			2
governor @entity227 last week warned the housing market could pose a ‘ risk to financial stability ’			0
@entity230 , of @entity231 , said : ‘ the increase in house prices is much larger than expected			1
it fuels fears of another boom and bust			0
the forecasts are startling and demonstrate the crucial need to create a sustainable housing market			0

economic growth is set to more than double this year
house prices are set to rise by 5.2 per cent on average next year
but @entity15 says families are facing a cost of living crisis
