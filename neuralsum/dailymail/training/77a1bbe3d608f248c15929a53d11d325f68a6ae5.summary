former @entity1 chairman @entity0 has defended current incumbent @entity2 amid increasing pressure			1
@entity4 , @entity1 ' third head coach in a year , has endured a tough start to life at the @entity8 helm , failing to get his side playing the attractive , incisive style which became a hallmark of the @entity13 's time at @entity14			1
worse still , the north @entity15 have struggled to pick up points , with sunday 's 2 - 1 loss to @entity18 their fourth defeat in just six @entity21 home matches			2
@entity1 chairman @entity2 has come under increasing pressure after @entity1 's torrid start to the season @entity0 ( right ) has defended his successor , saying that he is giving everything that can be expected that poor start has seen those from @entity4 to technical director @entity28 come under fire , so too divisive chairman @entity2			1
supporters are aiming a lot of ire in his direction but former @entity1 chairman @entity0 believes that anger is misdirected			1
' all you can expect from a chairman is the following : to provide the money for your football staff to do what they want to do , negotiate hard and bitterly if one of your best players has got a death wish to want to leave , and to provide an environment like a new stadium or training ground and all that kind of stuff , ' he told @entity51			2
' that is all the chairman can do			0
@entity0 received a lot of criticism of his own when in charge at @entity1 for a decade @entity0 speaks outside @entity1 to deny a clash of egos between himself and @entity61 ' people saying ' @entity2 out , @entity2 out ' , they do n't know what they are talking about			1
if @entity1 are going to progress , he is their best ally			2
all he can do is listen to the managers that he appoints			0
' they got Â£ 100million a year ago for the sale of @entity68			0
they went out and spent it on seven players			0
@entity28 , or whatever his name is , and @entity73 must have had some input into that and therein lies the problem , in my opinion			0
' if we have bought the wrong players and the money has been used irresponsibly , you have got to look at the person that guided you in that direction			0
