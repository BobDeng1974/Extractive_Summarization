by @entity0 unfair : @entity1 , the head of @entity2 , says viewers and critics are praising critically - acclaimed big budget @entity6 series at the expense of home - grown dramas a top @entity2 executive has blasted the perception that @entity6 tv shows are far superior to their @entity15 counterparts and defended @entity15 drama as the best in the world			1
@entity1 , the head of @entity2 , says viewers and critics who laud critically - acclaimed big budget @entity6 series like @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 are unaware of what the average @entity15 viewer is actually watching			1
he says wildly successful @entity15 dramas such as @entity28 's @entity27 , @entity29 and gritty police drama @entity30 are proof that audiences prefer home - grown content			1
' a trope has developed , a cultural meme that asserts that @entity6 drama is far superior to drama produced in the @entity15 and at the @entity2 , ' he said			1
' it 's an argument driven by box - set consumers who have a louder voice in @entity43 's cultural dialogue than the average family who sit down at night in @entity43 's towns and villages to decide which drama they want to watch			2
' over the last 15 years , and arguably starting with @entity50 's mafia epic @entity53 , @entity6 broadcasters such as @entity50 and @entity51 have attracted praise for producing sophisticated , intelligent and big - budget drama series			2
the fact that prohibition - era crime drama @entity58 's pilot episode was directed by @entity60 and cost £ 11m to produce indicates the importance tv executives place on their programming			0
other countries have followed suit , as evidenced by the success of @entity67 's @entity66			0
but with viewing figures of more than 10million per episode for domestic hits like @entity72 and @entity29 - and the enormous success of these shows throughout the world - he says @entity76 should be crowing about their success on the smaller screen			1
mr @entity1 , who earns £ 327,800 a year , wrote in his blog : ' in @entity43 , we are not very good at celebrating our success			1
we somehow find it embarrassing			0
' police dramas : @entity27 , which will soon be re-made in an @entity6 setting , drew more than 10million viewers for the finale			1
criminal drama @entity66 generated column inches but just under 600,000 viewers fantasy : the series 4 debut episode of @entity91 on @entity92 attracted 1.2m viewers			0
as well as viewing figures regularly topping 10million , dr who has also been sold around the world although it is difficult to get an accurate idea of viewing figures because of the changing ways viewers watch content , such as on - demand services like @entity106 and @entity107 , as well as paid subscription services like @entity109 and @entity110 , the figures appear to back up his views			0
episodes of @entity28 's @entity27 - which , interestingly , is soon to be re-made for @entity6 audiences - drew in more than 10million viewers			1
the @entity66 , which tv reviewers dedicated many column inches to praising , peaked at 599,000			0
dr @entity116 is senior lecturer in media theory at @entity118 and says the popularity of @entity6 tv shows partially stems from the frustration of following a series week after week , which has led to the ' @entity43 ' mentality			1
with the vast array of articles written about it , you 'd think everyone in the @entity15 was glued to @entity23 every week			1
but on @entity2 4 it had 355,000 viewers @entity29 is incredibly popular in the @entity6 some viewers even hold viewing parties @entity50 gangster epic @entity53 has been hailed as the start of the renaissance of @entity6 tv drama she added : ' @entity6 dramas have big budgets and special effects and is almost becoming the new film			1
@entity15 dramas go back to the roots , with relationships and the gravity of what is happening			2
' they have more depth to the characters and are more engaging			0
but some shows like @entity91 do both and it 's a very savvy move by @entity6 drama			0
' critical @entity6 darling @entity23 attracted 355,000 viewers at one point , whereas @entity28 's @entity29 regularly enjoys more than 11million viewers			1
fantasy epic @entity91 is among the most successful @entity6 imports and drew in 1.2million viewers on paid - for channel @entity92 for the season 4 debut			2
however , some episodes of the @entity2 's global smash @entity163 enjoy nearly ten times as many			2
the third series of @entity165 is being made by online giant @entity110 after the @entity2 axed the @entity167 crime drama			0
the show , set in @entity170 's @entity169 in 1889 - six months after the gruesome @entity171 , was axed by the @entity2 at the end of last year due to poor viewing figures			0
there were also some issues with sound - with dozens of viewers complaining to the @entity2 about ' meaningless mumbling ' throughout the second series			2
but thankfully for fans , it was saved by online retailer @entity110 - who have funded the third series along with production company @entity183			0
it will be aired on @entity185 - formerly @entity185 - in the autumn before being shown on @entity2 a few months later .			0

head of @entity2 @entity1 says too much attention is paid to @entity6 dramas like @entity23 , @entity22 and @entity21
claims more @entity15 viewers enjoy @entity15 hits like @entity72 and @entity27
