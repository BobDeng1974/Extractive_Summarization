former prime minister @entity0 has praised the'guts and drive ' shown by immigrants @entity0 has praised immigrants for having @entity5 instincts – and said most do not come here for benefits			1
the former prime minister said immigrants had the ‘ guts and drive ’ to travel vast distances to @entity12 ’s shores to make life better for themselves and their families			1
he said this desire to improve their lives was a ‘ very @entity5 instinct ’ of wanting to improve their lives			1
and he said that , in his experience , not all immigrants came to the @entity12 ‘ to benefit from our social security system ’ , he said			1
the welcoming tone is in stark contrast to that used by the current incumbent of @entity27 , @entity28			1
the prime minister wants to see the number of immigrants brought down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands			1
he has also pledged to fight for a renegotiation of our relationship with the @entity36 , to give us more powers over our borders and to crack down on benefit tourism			2
sir @entity0 also revealed that he knew the day after he won the 1992 election that he would go on to lose the next one five years later			1
he made his comments during an interview with the historian @entity43 for the @entity45 programme , reflections			2
the former @entity5 leader was talking about his time as a young man when he lived in modest circumstances with his family in @entity52 , south @entity53			2
‘ there was a different social value placed on immigration , ’ said sir @entity0			1
‘ i saw immigration at very close quarters in the 1950s			2
‘ they shared my house			2
i played with them as boys			2
i did n't see people who had come here just to benefit from our social system			0
i saw people with guts and the drive to travel halfway across the world in many cases to better themselves and their families			2
‘ and i think that is a very @entity5 instinct			1
but the prime minister looks set to miss his target after a surge in @entity81 immigration sir @entity0 's remarks are in stark contrast to @entity5 election campaigns since he lost the 1997 election to @entity86			1
lord @entity87 faced criticism for his campaign against @entity91 immigration policies in 2005 in the programme , sir @entity0 also admits that he knew as early as 1992 that he would not win the 1997 general election			1
‘ the day after the 1992 general election , @entity94 [ the @entity5 chairman ] and i sat in the @entity97 at @entity27 , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity94 had lost his seat at @entity99			0
and we agreed that in winning a fourth successive term , we had stretched the democratic elastic as far as it would go , and unless @entity91 collapsed , we would have little chance of winning the next election			0
he said that after the pound dropped out of the @entity106 on black wednesday in september 1992 : ‘ i was never sure whether i should have resigned or not ’ , he said			0
‘ i asked the views of people i respected like @entity109 and i think @entity111 and also people who were not politicians about whether i should resign , and their view was unequivocally that i should n’t and that if a prime minister did resigns a few months after winning an election that the government itself was doomed			1
now whether that was the right decision to stay on or not , i was never certain			0
‘ i was never in any doubt that winning the 1997 election would be very difficult			0
i was reinforced in that view by the impact of @entity122 , i thought it overwhelmingly likely that we would have lost			0
‘ in one sense it was liberating			0
it meant i could go and do , as @entity128 [ his policy unit head ] , for one , repeatedly said to me , you can do what you think is right			0
‘ you do n’t have to politically trim			0
you can do what you think is right and economically we did			0
’ sir @entity0 said his party was ‘ so difficult ’ over @entity81 , because the previous generation of conservatives who had lived through two world wars and believed in peace in @entity81 at all costs were replaced by younger conservatives who had grown up in ‘ more ideological ’ age			1
he said @entity143 went into the @entity106 because the recession of the late 1980s saw inflation and unemployment soar			0
he said the idea she was pushed into joining was ‘ utterly , utterly false ’			0
sir @entity0 revealed that @entity86 ’s reforms to the health service were ‘ the sort of thing i wished to do from the first moment i dreamed of going into politics ’			1
‘ i shall live with regret to my dying day that i did not have the wherewithal , and was not in a political position , to go down the route of those reforms which were the sort of things i wished to do from the first moment i dreamed of going into politics , ’ he said			0
the former leader said he would also have liked to increase teachers ’ pay and build more inner - city homes .			0
