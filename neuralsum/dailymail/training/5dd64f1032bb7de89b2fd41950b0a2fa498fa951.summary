by @entity1 reporter published : 11:14 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 12:39 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 has lost his damages action for wrongful dismissal against @entity5 an oil trader sacked because he was said to be not in a fit state after a heavy night out in @entity8 has lost his damages action for wrongful dismissal			1
@entity2 , 38 , was employed by @entity5 from january 2009 until october 2010 , when he was summarily dismissed for serious misconduct after missing a series of meetings on the business trip			1
contesting the action at @entity15 ’s @entity14 , @entity5 said he failed to attend critical meetings in the morning , at lunchtime and in the afternoon of october 11 and it was the latest in a series of alcohol - related incidents			1
mr @entity2 agreed that he was out until 4.30am drinking with colleagues , but said it was not to greater excess than anyone else and the business meetings later that day did not require his compulsory attendance			1
mr @entity2 , of @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , received a signing - on bonus the equivalent of 325,000 @entity33 dollars ( current value £ 202,000 ) when he joined the company and was on an annual salary of 225,000 @entity33 dollars ( £ 140,000 ) plus other benefits			1
mr @entity2 , a married father of three , was not in court to hear judge @entity39 make a costs order against him on the higher indemnity basis , with an interim payment due of £ 150,000			1
he said : ' this claim was ludicrous - it should never have been advanced			2
' at the start of the trial , the judge threw out the most valuable part of the claim - in respect of share options - as ' hopeless ' , leaving only the wrongful dismissal element which was worth £ 12,000 maximum			1
' in those circumstances , this is about as abnormal a case of this type that one could imagine			0
there was no conceivable justification for any claim being made at any point			2
' @entity5 ’s counsel , @entity60 , had told the court that ' context is everything '			0
' this is an industry where a mistaken decimal point might result in losses of a very substantial nature			0
an employer can not be expected to allow an employee who allows himself to become inappropriately inebriated to remain in the workplace			0
' asking for his client 's costs today , mr @entity60 said : ' mr @entity2 was dishonest in his evidence			1
he sought to deny the inevitable			0
mr @entity2 was habitually drunk and that was the reason he so egregiously failed to perform the duties required of him			2
' it was in mr @entity2 ’s power to remedy his behaviour			2
when he went on that conference , he could have chosen not to go out until the early hours and get drunk and to turn up to the meetings he was required to , but he chose not to do that			0
' contesting the action at @entity15 's @entity14 , @entity5 said he failed to attend critical meetings and it was the latest in a series of alcohol - related incidents he said that @entity5 had made an offer to mr @entity2 earlier for him to discontinue the case , with each side paying its own costs			1
a relevant factor was mr @entity2 ’s failure to accept the help @entity5 offered , involving a doctor and a consultant who was a world expert on drug and alcohol addiction			1
instead , he spent the next afternoon , when he should have been at work , in the pub. mr @entity2 , a married father of three , was not in court to hear judge @entity39 make a costs order against him on the higher indemnity basis , with an interim payment due of £ 150,000 ' this was a slap in the face for @entity5			1
this litigation is a slap in the face for @entity5			0
' mr @entity2 has lost his job because of his own behaviour , his own very bad behaviour			2
' @entity5 did everything they could to help him during the employment until they got to the end of their tether			0
the tether would have been considerably shorter with the majority of employers			0
his dismissal was richly justified			0
' notwithstanding that , @entity5 has then been forced to spend the best part of £ 400,000 defending a hopeless claim brought by someone who does not realise how tolerant @entity5 were and how much they did to help			2
' mr @entity60 said that mr @entity2 ’s absence record was ' appalling ' , being late or absent for at least 20 per cent of his service in @entity15			2
his non-attendance at the conference was the final straw and he found himself between a rock and a hard place			0
@entity5 ’s case was that he was too drunk to attend while mr @entity2 ’s was that he was not drunk , but stayed in bed as he had consumed too much and deliberately chose not to attend at least one of the meetings			1
either way he was in repudiatory breach of contract			0
in his ruling , the judge said that mr @entity2 was an unsatisfactory witness , inclined to contest what , on the evidence , could not seriously be contested and to minimise the extent of his alcohol consumption and its consequences			1
he took no steps to limit his consumption or seek help but simply continued on his existing path , paying no regard to the adverse effects for @entity5			0
his approach could be summarised as ' doing it his way '			0
' if , which i doubt , mr @entity2 did not simply sleep through the meetings which he missed , but consciously decided not to attend them , that in itself amounted to repudiatory breach of the contract which @entity5 was entitled to accept by dismissing him summarily			1
