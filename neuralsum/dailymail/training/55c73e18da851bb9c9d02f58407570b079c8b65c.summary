@entity44 and @entity45 campaigners said the cards were an insult			1
the @entity6 cards of today sport obscene and offensive messages the cards featuring explicit messages are stocked within full view of children in @entity55 stores @entity57 @entity56 , which campaigns against sexual and violent images , says it is ' not appropriate ' for children to see cards using this language @entity63 of the @entity64 said : ‘ crude and offensive greetings cards have no place in high street stores			1
‘ parents should be able to shop with their children without being confronted by products that are calculated to cause embarrassment or offence			1
