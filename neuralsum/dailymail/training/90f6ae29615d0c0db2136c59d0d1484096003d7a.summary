by @entity0 for the @entity1 my porch floor looked like something from a crime scene , thanks to the clear outline marked on the ceramic tiles			1
the evidence of foul play was as shocking as it was uncompromising			2
this was not the site of a grisly murder , but it was something almost as disturbing to a houseproud , middle - class wife and mother like me			2
there was a sharply delineated oblong of dust , indicating that my cleaner had mopped around the edges of the mat , rather than lifting it up and washing underneath			1
in the kitchen , evidence of yet another misdemeanour greeted me : a dirty dishcloth in the sink which had not been rinsed with hot water and soaked in bleach as i 'd requested			2
add to this the fact that my cleaner had arrived 15 minutes late that morning without bothering to apologise or explain , and you 'd imagine i flew up the stairs to tear a strip or two off her			1
but you 'd be wrong			2
instead of taking her to task and listing her many failings ( why does she think the corners of the carpets do n't need to be vacuumed ? ) i popped my head around the bedroom door			2
taking in the sight of her dreamily trailing a duster along the window ledges , i flashed my brightest smile and asked if she fancied a cuppa			2
when she said yes , i trundled obediently down the stairs , disguising the anger i felt at myself for failing to stand up to this woman who takes my hard - earned money every week yet treats cleaning my house as if she 's doing me a huge favour			1
home help : @entity0 ca n't imagine a happy domestic life without her cleaner so why is it that i , a strong - minded and fearless journalist who has faced down dangerous criminals and appeared on @entity80 's @entity79 , am incapable of taking my domestic help to task ? the answer ? i 'm terrified she will leave me			1
one wrong word from me and she 'll be off - and welcomed into the grateful arms of one of the many working women in neighbouring streets who 've been circling her like predatory lionesses			2
a cleaner is a precious commodity in this smart suburb of @entity96 , and i am told the situation is the same in other middle - class areas around the country			1
cleaners - even lackadaisical ones like mine - are fought over			1
and the fight is getting dirty as women go to increasingly desperate lengths to keep their cleaner away from enemy clutches			1
these days , as long as the domestic help is n't stealing the family silver , desperate working women like me will put up with anything rather than taking time out of their busy schedules to find another one			1
i 've lost count of the number of times i 've spoken to otherwise tough , successful , straight - talking friends who confess to being as weak as kittens when it comes to negotiating terms and pay with their cleaners			1
one , a high - flying taxation lawyer , employs a delightful girl who is punctual and charming but insists on spending half an hour each week rearranging the bottles inside the bathroom cabinet			0
the first time she did this , my friend - who lectures at industry events around the world - nervously suggested , with a quasi-giggle , that devoting time to such an endeavour was n't really necessary			0
would it not be more helpful , she tentatively suggested , if she spent the time vacuuming the stairs , digging the hair out the shower drain or cleaning the glass on the patio doors ? in other words , the unpleasant jobs that actually needed doing			0
the cleaner smiled and nodded			1
yet the following week the bottles were lined up like the @entity143 counter in @entity144 , and a plug of hair the size of a large hamster was left sitting in the shower drain			0
deaf ears ? or a cleaner who knew only too well she had her employer over a barrel ? another friend actually paid for her @entity157 cleaner to go back to her village outside @entity159 last @entity160 , maintaining it was a thank - you for all her hard work			1
actually , it was code for : ' do n't leave me - ever			1
' i 've also seen good friends become sworn enemies after one has poached the other 's cleaning lady			1
six million people in @entity172 now pay someone to help with household chores ' how could she do that to me ? ' i overheard one distraught woman ranting in a cafe a few months back			0
' the betrayal , the sneaking behind my back			0
i 'll never be able to trust anyone again ! ' i tuned in , convinced i was about to eavesdrop on a particularly salacious tale of suburban bed - hopping , only to learn the woman was furious her neighbour had stolen her cleaner - having secretly wooed her for weeks			1
i have heard of women inventing aliases for their help , and have one friend who will never tell me her ' brilliant ' cleaner 's name for fear i might snaffle her			1
she even refuses to say on what days she is employed , so no one can accost and poach her on the way home			0
like so many working women , i hate myself for giving my cleaner so much power			1
but what is the alternative ? every working mother i know needs a cleaner despite putting on endless rounds of washing and keeping on top of the day - to - day mess created by their families			1
as well as holding down a full - time job , i provide a taxi service for @entity211 , ten and @entity212 , 16 , as well as a general takeaway food and hotel service to their brothers , @entity217 , 21 and @entity218 , 19			0
why should i spend my days cleaning ? having built a successful 20 - year career as a writer and broadcaster , simply playing house would be a waste of my talents			0
without a cleaner , women like me are one heartbeat away from meltdown			1
we simply do n't have time to do it all			0
in demand : good cleaners can be hard to find sourcing a good one , however , is not easy			1
anyone paid £ 7 to £ 10 an hour to clean up someone else 's filth is n't going to be committed to the job			0
in a cleaner 's shoes , would n't i swap allegiances if someone down the road was serving better biscuits and let me watch a flat - screen tv while doing the ironing ? damn right i would			1
so would i poach someone 's cleaner ? you bet i would ! a few years ago i hired one who i 'd heard moaning about cleaning up after her employer 's toddlers , who loved to stuff fishfingers down the back of the sofa			1
sidling up to her at the school gate , i gushed that i 'd love her to work for me instead			2
' my children are much older , ' i said			0
' your life will be so much easier			0
' my ruse worked - until six months later i lost her to a single woman with no children			2
only once did i venture a tiny wisp of complaint to a cleaner , doing so by text to soften the implied criticism			2
she insisted on stuffing into drawers anything that was n't nailed to the carpet			0
consequently i 'd spend frustrated hours playing hunt the tax return / morning paper / party invitation			0
in the end i sent a chirpy little text asking if she 'd seen an @entity278 bag i 'd left on the bed			0
i did n't hear back for three days			0
edging into panic for my rash action , i nearly expired with joy when she finally replied , apologising that her phone was broken			0
and now my latest cleaner wants to go			2
she left a voicemail offering some rambling excuse about wanting to cut her hours			0
my husband @entity291 saw it as a moment to rejoice , with a lecture about how paying this woman was like setting tenners on fire			0
there has to be somebody out there who could do a better job - or at the very least lift a mat when mopping the floor			0
i crept upstairs to text back my response : ' will it make a difference if i pay a bit more ? '			0

@entity0 is terrified her cleaner will leave her
so she lets her get away with *sub-standard* work
good cleaners are hard to find
*competition* in the suburbs is fierce
friendships have been lost over poached domestic help
