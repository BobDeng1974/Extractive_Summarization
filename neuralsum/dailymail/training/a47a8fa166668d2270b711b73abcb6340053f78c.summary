@entity0 has slammed @entity1 for their failure to bring in a top defender to the club during the summer transfer window despite being the top spenders in the @entity7			1
@entity8 's @entity0 was working as a pundit for @entity10 on the game between @entity12 and @entity1 on sunday , after the game airing his views on @entity1 's defensive frailties - clear for all to see during their 5 - 3 defeat against the @entity17			1
even after landing @entity18 and @entity19 , the argument from @entity0 is that @entity1 lack a commanding centre - half , despite spending over £ 200million on new additions			1
@entity0 says it was mismanagement by @entity1 not to bring in a top defender @entity0 spoke honestly and passionately as he gave his thoughts on @entity1 's defence @entity0 said : ' @entity1 were the biggest spending team in the @entity7 and have n't even bought a proper defender			1
' to spend that much money and not bring in a top class defender is mis - management at the end of the day			2
' you look at @entity34 last season and the goals they conceded which ultimately cost them the league , @entity1 look vulnerable like that at the back this season			0
' they look like the @entity1 of old in terms of their attacking play and are showing real pace and quality in that department for sure , but defensively you have to question them			0
' to compound matters for the @entity48 @entity47 was taken off injured in the first half , while @entity50 was dismissed in the second half for a professional foul which led to @entity12 's fifth and final goal from the penalty spot			0
@entity56 's disappointment is clear to see on the @entity1 bench as they surrendered a two - goal lead @entity1 duo @entity59 and @entity60 vent their frustration at referee @entity62 after he sends off @entity50 for a professional foul leading to @entity12 's fifth goal from the penalty spot the latest defeat , which leaves @entity1 firmly poised in mid-table with just five points from as many games , will come as a huge blow to @entity56 who would have be looking for his side to build on their emphatic win against @entity74 last weekend and make it back - to - back wins against @entity12			1
@entity77 was understandably bemused after seeing his side throw away a two - goal lead , admitting he did n't know exactly what had happened			2
he said : ' we had complete control			0
how is it possible that you give this game away ? ' ' you never expect that when you 're 3 - 1 ahead			2
you have to kill the game and keep possession			0
we could n't do that			0
