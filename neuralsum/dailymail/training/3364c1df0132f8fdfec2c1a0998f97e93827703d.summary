it might have been a mild 65 degrees in @entity1 , @entity2 , today - but it did n't stop these happy kids having a snowball fight			1
pupils at the @entity6 in the central @entity2 city , on the @entity9 coast , put on their winter coats and @entity12 hats after six tonnes of the white stuff was trucked in			0
they got a taste of the unseasonable weather for their ' snow day ' , which is sponsored by the @entity18			0
rare occasion : fifth graders @entity21 ( left ) , @entity22 ( center , in pink ) and @entity25 ( right ) throw snowballs outside at @entity27 in @entity1 , @entity2 sledding : @entity28 , 11 , dashes down a sledding ramp at the school , which had a six - ton snow delivery courtesy of the @entity18 as well as indulging in a classic snowball fight , the students also made snowmen and rode sleds down a ramp			1
for some students it was their first ever experience with snow			0
fifth - grader @entity22 , who threw one of the first snowballs , stopped briefly to say : ' it 's fun '			2
@entity1 is a very unlikely candidate for december snow - with an average low temperature of 56 degrees , according to the @entity46			1
the record low for december - recorded in 1938 - was 35 degrees , still slightly above freezing point			1
it is unclear how much the event cost , but comparable ' snow party ' services offer several tons of snow for around $ 1,200			0
in a statement , a member of the @entity18 said : ' it was a wonderful day with lots of fun had by all students and staff ! ' fun for all : @entity63 , a first - grade teacher , laughs alongside her pupil @entity64 , left , at the bottom of the sledding ramp new experiences : some of the students and the school have never seen or touched snow in real life before pose : six - year - old @entity72 poses with a tiny snowball as she plays with other kindergartners			2

hefty delivery at @entity78 elementary in @entity1
