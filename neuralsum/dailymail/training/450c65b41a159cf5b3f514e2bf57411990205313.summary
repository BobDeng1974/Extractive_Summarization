a waxworks which has been described as @entity2 ’s worst museum is facing closure because its elderly owners can not find anyone else to run it			2
the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , has cult status on the internet because so many of its models look nothing like the people they are supposed to represent			1
thousands of visitors still pay £ 5 each to visit the seaside attraction so they can mock the far from lifelike models of celebrities , sports stars and royalty			1
dud ringers : @entity24 and @entity25 look very little like they do in real life @entity28 , 82 , and her husband @entity27 , 85 , who have run the museum since 1955 fear they will have to close the business if nobody wants to take it over			0
mrs @entity28 said : ' in june this year my husband was taken seriously ill with pneumonia			0
we do n’t want to retire but when your health starts to decline you have to think			0
' it will be a shame as we ’ve been here 57 years , and it would be nice to make 60 , but we ’ve no family interested in taking it on			0
worst in @entity2 : the @entity45 and prince @entity46 feature in the exhibition - but these waxworks are n't flattering terrible : princess @entity51 's beauty is lost in this waxwork and , right , prince @entity53 has a deathly palour odd looking : royals @entity56 and the @entity57 , right , are barely recognisable ' it ’s softly , softly and we hope we will be able to continue as it ’s also our home			0
' the couple are now seeking planning permission to change the use of the museum from a waxworks to residential use			0
but mrs @entity28 said they were also seeking a reduction in rates payable to @entity70 to make it a more viable business			0
going down ( under ) : @entity73 and @entity74 are showcased in the exhibition which is facing closure tv fame : presenter @entity78 and @entity79 are just about recognisable the museum has more than 150 models , mostly dating back to the 1970s and 1980s , including an unflattering prince @entity46 , a dusky skinned @entity82 and model @entity84			1
a model of prince @entity53 has him in a casual sweater with a full head of hair while a model of the @entity45 looks less than regal			0
the museum which employs three staff also includes a chamber of horrors and a collection of antique amusement machines			0
well known : @entity96 and pope @entity97 are among the museum 's 150 waxworks resemblance ? model @entity84 and @entity101			0
most of the stars date back to the 1970s and 1980s mocked : @entity104 and @entity105 are among the stars mocked by punters many of the models have been widely mocked on the internet , particularly by visitors on the review website @entity113			1
some have even admitted travelling more than 120 miles to visit the waxworks so they can laugh at the models			1
@entity117 , who visited the museum in september , wrote on the site : ' this is well worth the £ 5 entry fee as its sooooo bad it 's good			1
loved : war - time prime minister @entity124 , and right , @entity125			0
some fans of the museum have even admitted travelling more than 120 miles to visit the waxworks so they can laugh at the models help : name plates help visitors identify waxworks like footballer @entity133 and right cricket star @entity134 ' some of the waxworks are unrecognisable and thankfully you are helped out with nameplates			1
the setting of the building is very dark and moody which really adds to the creepiness of waxworks			0
' the torture chamber section was a bit unnerving as it was so dark and not helped that when you leave , you exit via a very spooky derelict arcade			0
if you love freaky things , this is superb			0
i 'm so glad we went , it was brilliant fun : ) ' @entity153 of @entity154 , @entity155 , who also visited in september , wrote : ' well worth the 2 hour drive and entry fee for the laugh alone			0
ice stars : @entity161 and @entity162 are among the waxworks which have drawn crowds value ? snooker star @entity167 and former footballer @entity168 feature at the attraction which costs £ 5 ' one or two are spot on ( @entity171 ) ( the dead person in the dungeon ) but without the nameplates etc you would n't have a chance of knowing who they were			1
' i 'm sure a lot of love and work has gone into the making of the waxworks but to know exactly who they are makes it a lot of fun			0
' another reviewer from @entity192 , @entity193 , who gave it an ‘ excellent ’ rating said : ' what can i say , after reading all the reviews , my girlfriend and i visited last saturday , i have to agree with all the reviews , the smell , the dust , cobwebs what a joy			0
fame : @entity206 's face is a funny shade of pink and and right motorcycle road racer @entity210 sports : decathlete @entity212 has a huge moustache and footballer @entity214 is right ' the waxworks were a giggle all the way through , not sure what @entity105 was supposed to be , and had a finger missing , its a place you must visit , i proposed to my girlfriend in front of the royal family , she said yes through the fits of giggles '			1
mr @entity229 described the museum as ‘ unfailingly popular ’ in 2008 when he revealed that he was auctioning off 75 heads of models which had been taken off display			1
but he cancelled the auction after newspaper articles poked fun at the models he was trying to sell for around £ 80 each			1
politics : @entity239 , left , and @entity240 is recognisable from his black rimmed spectacles giggles : former tennis player @entity243 and former @entity245 leader @entity244 mr @entity229 admitted at the time that some of his models were no longer recognisable			1
he said : ' some of them are too old and they do not resemble their subjects any more and obviously some visitors are far too young to remember them			1
' in an interview in 2004 , mr @entity229 said : ' we have never had any complaints and a lot of people give us the thumbs up and say they enjoyed it on the way out			1
stars : the @entity261 and right @entity262 are among the music legends which feature in the display enduring : @entity265 and @entity266			2
in the resort 's heyday visitors had to queue to get in ' @entity8 needs attractions and exhibitions and we are about the only good exhibition left here			2
' mr @entity229 insisted that people 's impressions of waxworks were always subjective and someone might consider a figure a good likeness while others might say it was not lifelike			1
he added : ' some are very good whereas some are a bit dated - but as they cost £ 1,000 each they have to have a good life and ca n't be replaced every year			2
' in the resort 's heyday in the 1960s , visitors had to queue to get in and went round the exhibition in lines of up to four abreast , he added			2
the museum is closed for the winter season from tomorrow			0
popular : @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 faces closure but has developed cult status attraction : @entity294 has been run by a husband and wife team for 57 years , and both are in their eighties it was named after the great grandson of @entity302 , the founder of the famous waxworks museum in @entity304 in 1835			1
the @entity8 museum ’s website describes it as ' different from many wax museums , in that it remembers the stars and famous people as they were at their height of fame and influence			1
' it adds : ' see your gallery of how people looked , how the passionate owners captured them at this time and preserved them for your enjoyment			2
many wax museum ( sic ) update their models to keep the realistic to reflect the current looks or styles			2
' if you are looking back to the 70s , so ( sic ) the stars as they were			2
show your grand children the stars and leaders during your generation and help us bring the museum to life			2
