two major banks are to let their customers access their accounts on their iphones using @entity6 's @entity5 fingerprint scanning technology			1
@entity7 ( @entity8 ) and @entity9 said that customers will no longer need to remember complicated login information to see their finances			1
it is the first time a major bank has enabled the fingerprint recognition technology in place of passwords and passcodes on a mobile phone application			1
touch id uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			2
users can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			0
@entity5 can also be replace an @entity39 password when buying music , apps or books			1
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - resolution image scan before the @entity47 in @entity49 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip			0
the prints are not stored on an @entity6 server , or backed up to @entity57			0
however some experts have warned that as more of our data is protected by the @entity5 @entity8 said that it hoped the technology would make it easier and more convenient for customers to access their finances			1
@entity65 , managing director of @entity8 and @entity66 , said : ' there has been a revolution in banking , as more and more of our customers are using digital technology to bank with us			1
' adding @entity5 to our mobile banking app makes it even easier and more convenient for customers to manage their finances on the move			1
' while the banks are the first to make use of @entity6 's @entity5 fingerprint scanning technology , they are not the first to use such biometric scanning			1
@entity81 announced last year that it is to introduce ' finger - vein ' readers to allow their customers to get rid of their pin numbers			2
the scanners take an infra - red scan of the unique vein pattern that lies just below the skin			0
@entity81 said that it was rolling out the devices to its 30,000 corporate customers this year and if successful it would be extended to its other customers			2
@entity6 's @entity5 uses a sensor to scan the fingerprint of users that it then matches to one stored in its software			1
some @entity99 already use @entity5 for making purchases , including @entity6 's own @entity101 and @entity103 's app. @entity8 and @entity9 say 50 per cent of their 15 million customers now use online banking , with three million using their mobile app. the banks estimate that 1.8 million of those use @entity3 , on average 40 times per month			1
however , not all models of the @entity3 have @entity5 , with older devices and the @entity112 not featuring the hardware			1
those with the right technology will have to activate the feature with their usual security information but would then only need to use @entity6 's @entity5 from then on			1
it took just two days and a small collection of everyday household items for a group of @entity124 hackers to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an @entity25			0
the group , calling themselves the @entity127 , took a high - resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass using 2400 dpi resolution			0
the image was then cleaned up using photo - editing software before being inverted			0
they then laser printed it onto a transparent sheet with 1200 dpi resolution using a thick toner setting			0
the hackers then poured pink latex milk or white woodglue into the print pattern created by the toner onto the transparent sheet			0
after it dried , the thin latex sheet is lifted from the sheet , breathed on ' to make it a tiny bit moist ' and pressed onto the sensor to unlock the phone			0
@entity6 said the @entity5 fingerprint sensor is designed to provide ' accurate readings from any angle after three failed login attempts with @entity5 , however , customers would have to re-enter their passcodes			1
last year @entity8 said that it would invest £ 1 billion over the next three years to make it easier for customers to bank when they are on the move			1
@entity161 , head of strategy and innovation at digital banking consultants @entity165 , said that biometric security like fingerprint scanning had the potential to make banking services safer to use by reducing the risk of phishing attacks and identity fraud			2
he said : ' the key benefit of biometric security is that they do n’t only make services more secure , but also easier to use			2
' our research shows that eight in ten people are ready to ditch their passwords in favour of biometric security measures			2
' the popularity of mobile devices like the best - selling @entity184 has finally helped move biometric technology into the mainstream			0
' this will provide banking customers with the convenience of not having to remember multiple log ins that are entered manually whilst also reducing the potential for phishing attacks and identity fraud			2
' however , the introduction of @entity5 will raise some concerns among security experts			1
@entity124 hacker @entity197 claimed that he had managed to use photographs of @entity124 defense minister @entity199 's hand to recreate her fingerprints			2
others have shown that it is possible to unlock @entity5 secured phones by lifting fingerprints from glass or the device 's screen			1
@entity209 , of @entity210 , a @entity124 hacking think tank , told the @entity213 : ' just the fact that you are carrying the key around with you and leave copies of it exposed everywhere you go makes it a very different risk to something that is inside your brain			0
the risks are poorly understood			0
' @entity224 , global head of pre-sales at security experts @entity228 , said : ' there is always a balancing act when it comes to authentication			2
make it too easy for the user and the authentication may be compromised or circumvented , too hard and adoption rates for the new authentication technology will drop			0
' one of the main drivers of this authentication technology taking hold , is that the current generation ’s device of choice is now firmly the smartphone , with there now being over 1.75 billion devices in use worldwide and this is ever growing			0
' with the advent of reliable fingerprint readers on the latest smartphones , the second " something the user knows " component is switched from a potentially easy - to - break password to a physical one that is unique			0

@entity8 and @entity9 want customers to use fingerprints to access accounts
they say it will save customers from remembering difficult passwords
the banks have 880,000 customers who use iphones that have @entity5
they can activate the feature by registering with their usual security details
after three failed login attempts with @entity5 , the app asks for passcodes
