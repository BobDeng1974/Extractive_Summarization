turn on the telly , lie back and think of @entity1 the way it used to be			1
not with @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 sharing their expertise and defensive acumen			2
or maybe there ’s the midfield craft of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			0
or the striking instincts of @entity20 and @entity21			0
that ’s a decent international team right there , boasting more than 500 caps and more than a hundred goals , even without @entity27 host @entity28			0
or @entity29 , one of a few @entity1 internationals from his generation involved in coaching , when his @entity34 tv duties allow			1
@entity35 beat @entity1 2 - 0 in 1993 and almost all of the @entity38 side are in coaching but not one player from @entity1 is in management ... @entity35 @entity42 : now works with goalkeepers at @entity38 amateur side @entity44 @entity45 : ex-boss at @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 97 , @entity53 & @entity54 , recently retired as assistant at @entity56 and now working on tv @entity58 : @entity60 manager minutes after escaping a red card for pulling down @entity62 , @entity63 fired a free kick past @entity65 @entity66 : @entity68 manager @entity69 : ex-barcelona manager now retired @entity71 : ex-manager of @entity68 & @entity73 , also coached at @entity74 & @entity75 , now head of youth development at @entity78 in @entity79 @entity80 : @entity60 assistant , also ex-manager of @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity73 & @entity75 @entity86 : @entity68 assistant @entity88 : @entity68 director of football @entity90 : was @entity91 & @entity93 assistant , but chose tv when urged by @entity68 to make a career choice @entity96 : @entity97 – @entity99 & @entity100 coach subs : winter : @entity93 coach @entity104 : coaching 8 - 10 - year - olds at @entity84 @entity106 is tackled as he challenges for the ball ( left ) as @entity20 loses out to @entity108 ( right ) @entity109 seaman : occasionally helps @entity111 coach their goalkeepers @entity113 : ex-manager of @entity115 and @entity116 , last seen blogging for @entity117 @entity118 : various media @entity120 : ex-manager of @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 @entity127 : works in the media @entity130 : ex-manager of @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 in @entity135 @entity62 : ex-manager of @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and assistant at @entity141 @entity142 : coaching at an independent school in @entity144 @entity20 : eight games as @entity147 ’s caretaker manager in 2009 , now @entity149 pundit @entity106 : less than two years as @entity151 manager , now @entity152 pundit @entity106 challenged by @entity153 as @entity1 crashed to defeat in the vital qualifying match @entity155 : @entity157 sports pundit subs : @entity159 : ex-manager of @entity161 and @entity162 @entity163 : @entity149 broadcaster @entity163 is dejected after @entity1 's hopes of reaching the @entity166 in 1994 many former @entity1 stars have opted for the sofa			1
who can blame them ? coaching is a vocation , an all - consuming passion ; not something to dabble at in the hope of discovering you possess a magical gift			1
@entity177 , @entity178 and sir @entity179 have devoted their lives to it			0
many top players from the previous generation were chewed up and spat out having been through the usual routine : use your name to get a job , discover it ’s damn hard and totally different to being a player and either get disillusioned or sacked or both			1
soon the name does n’t open doors because you ’re no longer a star footballer but a failed manager			0
in the @entity198 , managers survive an average of eight months , not even long enough to complete the @entity201 course , the top qualification which is required to coach in the top two tiers of @entity109 football			2
@entity29 is one of a few former @entity1 internationals involved in coaching after stopping playing @entity18 ( left ) and @entity7 right ) chose to work as pundits upon ending their playing days @entity60 boss @entity63 is one of a number of @entity38 professionals who have gone on to coach it is a staggering statistic but out of the 92 @entity214 managers , only four have played for @entity1 and they have just 25 caps between them			1
they are @entity218 ’s @entity217 ( 14 caps ) , @entity221 ’s @entity220 ( 5 ) , @entity223 ’s @entity222 ( 3 ) and @entity225 ’s @entity224 ( 3 )			0
here lies the mangled logic at the heart of the problem			0
in the spirit of the football culture in this country , many good players are impatient , convinced they should bypass the qualification process			2
they would rather learn on the job but the job is too insecure on which to learn			0
time in charge is diminishing , as is the likelihood of a second chance			0
little wonder @entity109 coaching has become a punchbag for the failing national team , although @entity109 coaches actually do nothing much different to their foreign counterparts			2
did we not like it when @entity35 beat @entity1 in @entity56 in october 1993 ? look back on the teams and none of @entity252 ’s players are working full - time in football , although most have tried and some may return			1
@entity120 managed for 238 games			0
almost all the @entity38 side are locked into the game at different levels			2
six of them have the @entity201 , compared with three of the @entity109			0
@entity108 is coach of @entity68 and has won the @entity38 league four times in as many seasons @entity263 ( left ) is part of @entity35 's coaching setup and is earmarked to succeed @entity266 ( centre ) former @entity111 winger @entity268 ( right ) is now the director of football at @entity68 @entity63 is at @entity60 and coveted by @entity269 , @entity108 is at @entity68 , where @entity268 and @entity86 are in senior roles			1
@entity271 was involved in the @entity68 youth set - up until the club ordered him to choose between his coaching and broadcasting			1
he chose tv , surprisingly			0
move on to the @entity278 meeting between the nations and the @entity38 team includes @entity75 boss @entity281 and @entity263 , earmarked to succeed @entity266 as @entity35 coach			1
with @entity284 stepping up to become @entity84 boss next season , it means @entity35 ’s ‘ @entity288 ’ clubs will be led by legends with more than 300 caps between them			1
there is nothing comparable in this country			0
scour 92 clubs and you can find 25 @entity1 caps , property of @entity222 ( 3 ) , @entity224 ( 3 ) , @entity220 ( 5 ) and @entity217 ( 14 )			1
there is a better show from some of the other @entity302			0
in @entity304 ’ @entity278 team which beat @entity35 4 - 1 , there was @entity306 , now @entity139 manager , protected in the confines of the @entity310 bubble where @entity311 spent much of his coaching career and where @entity29 is learning			1
there was @entity314 , part - time at @entity315 , and also in the squad were @entity317 , @entity319 ’s director of football , and @entity320 , coach at @entity147			2
nothing proves elite players make the best coaches			2
the opposite could be true to some extent when you look at @entity179 , @entity177 or @entity178			0
but international players can make fine coaches as sir @entity329 , sir @entity330 , @entity331 and @entity304 proved			2
some who have devoted much time to this subject conclude that the trend is rooted in the @entity337 culture , where academic teaching has always held sway over sporting education and where youth coaching is not treated as a career in itself — unlike in parts of @entity344 and the @entity345			2
@entity221 manager @entity220 is one of four former @entity1 internationals in the @entity214 @entity223 boss @entity222 played three times for @entity1 but now manages in the @entity348 the opening of @entity350 has boosted the facilities on hand to the @entity1 national team why would millionaire footballers trade their comfortable lives to start at the bottom of a profession struggling for identity ? this friction has lingered since the days of sir @entity360 , who met resistance from traditionalists running clubs and the @entity310 when he tried to modernise the @entity1 team to keep pace with countries such as @entity85 and @entity367 in the ’ 50s			1
the opening of @entity350 and recent changes to coach education at the @entity310 represent a big step forward according to many , but some views are deeply engrained			0
@entity360 once asked @entity330 , one of his @entity1 players , what he might do when he finished playing			1
‘ i do n’t know , ’ replied @entity330			0
‘ i do n’t think cleaning windows is an option			0
’ nor was a job on @entity379 , so @entity360 persuaded @entity330 to attend one of his coaching courses			2
imagine @entity382 asking @entity383 the same question			0
‘ i ’m going to help banish child poverty , model underpants and buy a franchise for a soccer team in @entity389 , @entity382			0
’ how do the @entity38 get their players into the coaching system ? and how do they stay there when so many of the @entity109 slide out ? is it because @entity1 is a nation which prefers coaches to have come through the system ? quite the opposite , really			1
the obsession with rushing big - name players into high - profile jobs was more probably part of the problem			1
they were n’t ready for it , since they had no coaching experience , and have fallen out of the system , no doubt bruised by those who sit in judgment and brand them coaching failures			2
@entity413 manager @entity412 is the top - ranked @entity109 manager , his team eighth in the @entity348 northern irishman @entity415 , the @entity417 manager , is the highest ranked @entity337 coach in fifth meanwhile , there are brilliant coaches who have spent their lives in the lower leagues , a welcoming hand never reaching out to them from the @entity348			1
many of the ’ 93 @entity35 team went through the @entity68 gateway to a coaching career , a club with a reputation for producing elite talent			1
they were not thrown in at @entity132 like @entity130 or at @entity430 like @entity142			0
@entity35 is a hot - house football environment			1
fewer professional teams mean it has a more concentrated focus of talent in competition			0
there is a greater tactical education and a desire to exchange ideas , all of which works for both young players and young coaches			2
@entity413 ’s @entity412 is the top - ranked @entity109 manager in this country whose team are eighth in the @entity348			1
of nine @entity109 managers in the top flight , five are in the bottom six fighting to prove their worth as the foreign coaches contest the title with @entity415 , the top - ranked @entity454 offering hope in fifth			1
@entity456 has already managed @entity60 and @entity457 at the age of 43 @entity460 manager @entity459 ( left ) and @entity462 boss @entity461 are both highly rated @entity337 coaches should anyone slip , there is a ready supply of experienced and fully qualified foreign coaches , often ex-internationals , waiting to step in			0
ambitious coaches such as @entity63 and @entity456 regularly jump ahead of promising homespun talent such as @entity459 and @entity461			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , are in danger of surrendering an entire generation of international footballers to an array of media opportunities .			1

in 1993 , @entity35 beat @entity1 2 - 0 in a @entity166 qualifier
many of the @entity1 internationals from that night are now working in punditry
on the @entity35 side however , most players are now working in coaching
only four former @entity1 players are now managing across the top four leagues
