@entity0 from @entity1 , @entity2 , talks about her experience of being circumcised says she does n't blame her mother for taking her to have the procedure when she was just a baby			1
@entity0 ( not her real name to protect her identity ) , who now lives in the @entity14 , had ' the cut ' in @entity1 , where circumcision for girls is widely practiced , when she was just a few months old			1
she said : ' in my culture , it is believed that when the vagina is cut , the desire to have sex is cut as well and that sex is only something a woman does with her husband to have children			1
' ' most people in @entity1 think that if a girl is cut , she will grow up to be a good girl ; that she will not bring shame on her family and she will marry well			1
' if a girl is not cut , they think she will grow up to be a " slut " - a girl who thinks about sex and will not be satisfied by one man			1
' people believe that a girl who is not cut will bring shame on her family with her behaviour , that no one will marry her and she will be abandoned			0
' most people feel this way in my country and it is only those who are educated that disagree with the practice of cutting			2
' @entity0 ' story reveals how entrenched the culture of @entity9 is @entity1 , which borders @entity55 and @entity56 , where the barbaric practice - the partial or total removal of external female genitalia for non-medical reasons - is even said to prevent women growing up to be clumsy			1
girls are mutilated by someone with no medical training , often using instruments such as a knife , pair of scissors , scalpel or razor blade			0
anaesthetic is n't used and the victims are often forcibly restrained			0
@entity0 was too young to remember her ordeal and only found out the truth by hearing her parents arguing - as her father had not wanted her to be subjected to it			1
she said : ' my father was an educated and modern man who disagreed with the belief and culture of cutting			0
my mother was from a traditional family and from a different community of people to my father			2
' my mother had taken me to be cut while my father was away on business , as she knew he would not have allowed it			2
i was cut and sewn up when i was just a few months old , and when my father found out he was furious			0
' ' the first time i heard about cutting was from overhearing my parents fight about it , which they did throughout my childhood			0
' i am not angry with my mother for taking me to get cut ; my mother is a traditional person and has n't been educated about it			2
she thought she was doing the best for me			0
other negative stereotypes were also attached to women who had not had the procedure			2
@entity0 said : ' in my culture there is a belief that if a girl is clumsy , she had not been cut			1
people from my country , even believe this here in the @entity14			1
' i was at church recently and i dropped a glass of water			0
while i was cleaning the mess up , an older woman said to me " you did n't have the cut "			2
' she did not say this with anger or as a joke ; she said it as a matter of fact , because she does n't know differently			0
' now in her early 20s , @entity0 only recently came to realise that @entity9 is not the norm for all women and has found support as she deals with its consequences from children 's charity the @entity131			1
she said : ' i grew up not knowing that i was different , or that being cut was not normal for every other girl in the world			0
@entity0 first came into contact with the @entity131 in the @entity14 following a horrific ordeal where she was brought to the @entity14 by sex traffickers			1
she revealed : ' i was separated from my family after problems started in my country and i was trafficked to the @entity14 by men who raped me			1
it was incredibly painful for me , so painful that i could n't think			0
i have grown up believing that this level of pain during sex is normal , but i now know differently			2
' ' i did n't talk to anyone before i met the @entity131 as it 's not something that you speak about			0
before i saw the nurse i did n't notice any difference in my body as i 'm the same as other girls from my home town			0
' i believe cutting is something that should be stopped			0
it is a disgusting practice that many people only do because they believe that the stories around it are true and they are uneducated			2
' i do not think that people really understand the problems which female genital mutilation can cause for girls			0
' @entity165 , a barber from @entity166 , mimics the way he used to perform female genital mutilation thanks to being a victim of @entity9 , @entity0 worries about her future and whether she will be able to have children			1
she said : ' i look ahead and see problems with any relationships that i choose to have because i 'm afraid that sex will hurt			0
my periods are painful too and i 've been told it will be very painful to give birth			0
' the @entity131 believe 23,000 girls under 15 could be at risk of @entity9 in @entity180 and @entity181 even though it became a criminal offence in the @entity14 in 1985			1
in 2003 it also became a criminal offence for @entity14 nationals or permanent @entity14 residents to take their child abroad to have female genital mutilation			1
anyone found guilty of the offence faces a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison			0
despite this , many young girls are taking abroad during ' cutting season ' aka the school holidays where they are mutilated without pain relief while being forcibly restrained			0
the charity is working to stop @entity9 - which they believe is a form of child abuse - and ask professionals who worry a child is at risk to contact them on the number below			1
cupcakes designed to look like vaginas were baked for the @entity205 to @entity9 in @entity206 in february , 2014 those who have suffered as a result of @entity9 can also call the number for help and support			1
@entity213 @entity212 said : ' we know from contacts to our @entity9 helpline that there is a major problem in some @entity14 communities where children are subjected to this appalling abuse			1
' many thousands of children are at risk of being taken abroad to be cut and families are starting to get smart about this - they are getting the message that agencies are focusing on children who are a bit older so people are now beginning to subject children to @entity9 at a much younger age			2
' we would urge anyone who has a concern or needs advice to contact the @entity131 ’s fgm helpline on 0800 028 3550 or email fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk - it does n't matter if you 're uncertain , we 're here to talk things through and you may in turn stop a child from being subjected to this barbaric practice			1

of the calls , 259 of the cases have been so serious that they have been referred to children 's services and the police			0
