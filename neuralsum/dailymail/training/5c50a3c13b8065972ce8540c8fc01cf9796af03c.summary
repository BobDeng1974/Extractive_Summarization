warning : archbishop of canterbury @entity0 has warned that gay marriage could put anglicans around the world in danger a @entity9 decision to accept gay marriage would be ‘ absolutely catastrophic ’ for @entity11 in troubled countries , the archbishop of @entity7 said yesterday			1
anglicans in countries such as @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are in danger as a result of liberal positions taken by the leaders of churches in the west , he said			1
the most reverend @entity0 said he had visited a grave containing 369 bodies in @entity15 , where some people believed ‘ if we leave a @entity11 community here we will all be made to become homosexual and so we will kill all the @entity11 ’			1
he said on an @entity30 phone - in that while he was deeply concerned with the suffering of gay people in @entity35 , the issue of gay rights was not simple			1
the archbishop and other @entity9 leaders have given regular hints of a softened line on homosexuality , and a high - level @entity42 report has said clergy should be able to conduct blessings for gay couples			1
he told a caller who said vicars should be allowed to make up their own minds on gay weddings : ‘ what we say here is heard around the world			2
why ca n’t we just do it now ? ‘ because the impact of that on @entity11 in countries far from here , like @entity15 , like @entity17 , @entity16 and other places would be absolutely catastrophic and we have to love them as much as the people who are here			0
‘ i ’ve stood by a graveside in @entity61 of a group of @entity11 who ’d been attacked because of something that had happened far , far away in @entity65			2
and they were attacked by other people because of that			0
‘ the mass grave had 369 bodies in it and i was standing with the relatives			0
that burns itself into your soul , as does the suffering of gay people in this country			0
’ dilemma : the archbishop said he had agonised over his support for gay rights issues the archbishop said gay rights was ‘ really not a simple issue ’ and added : ‘ it ’s something that i wrestle with every day and often in the middle of the night			1
’ ‘ we have to listen incredibly carefully to the lgbt communities here			0
and we have to look at the tradition of the @entity9 , and the teaching of the @entity9 , and the teaching of scripture , which is definitive in the end , before we come to a conclusion			2
‘ but we ’re not in a position just to suddenly say , okay our position in this country has changed			0
’ the archbishop is the head of the worldwide @entity9 communion , which has nearly 80million worshippers and is highly influential in countries in @entity61 and @entity105 where the confrontation between @entity107 and @entity11 is often violent			1
celebration : but gay marriage poses a danger to @entity111 in countries such as @entity15 and @entity17 , mr @entity0 said one caller on the phone - in show was former @entity116 mp @entity115 , who left the @entity9 for the @entity117 in 1993 after the @entity9 chose to ordain women as priests			1
miss @entity115 suggested to the archbishop that his ‘ heart has just sunk ’ after hearing her voice			0
she said she left the @entity9 partly because it ‘ never seems to know what it thinks about anything ’			2
he replied : ‘ i think i ’m right , you think i ’m wrong			0

@entity0 says @entity111 will be in danger if @entity9 recognises gay marriage
