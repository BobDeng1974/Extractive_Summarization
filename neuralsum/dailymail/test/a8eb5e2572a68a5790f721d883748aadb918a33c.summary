many people have the bad habit of squeezing blackheads and pimples on their faces			2
but for one @entity6 - based writer , the urge to stand in front of a mirror and poke at and squeeze her pores for hours on end became so bad that it actually started ' sabotaging ' her life			1
in an inspiring essay for @entity15 , @entity16 , 27 , tells of her experience with dermatillomania - a compulsive skin - picking disorder that left her face bleeding - and how she managed to overcome it			1
' i 'd descend " into the mirror " for up to four hours a day , ' @entity16 writes in the essay , explaining how her actions horrified her parents			1
' i would nick and squeeze and yank at every clogged pore on my face			2
as a child she developed bad eating habits - she would skip breakfast and lunch , then stuff her face with whatever she wanted for hours when she got home			1
her binge - eating cycle continued through college and after graduation , when she moved back home to her parents ' house in @entity46			1
' i knew i was bingeing while i was bingeing , ' she writes , adding that part of the problem was that she would head to the kitchen whenever she felt bored			0
' so i decided to find a new place to spend my ample downtime			2
' that place became her parents ' bathroom , where her mom kept a stainless steel 10x magnifying mirror and an array of @entity61 tweezers			2
@entity16 's use of the tweezers started off innocently enough , with her plucking out stray hairs along her eyebrows			2
then she started to become obsessive , revisiting her brows several times a day and moving on to other areas of her face , where she would use those same tweezers to clear out pores and remove ingrown hairs			2
' at one point , i became convinced that there was a lone dark hair trapped under my chin , ' she says			0
' i could think of nothing more vital than removing this growth from my face			2
in the process of freeing the ( probably imagined ) hair , i dug an eighth - inch deep hole			0
' getting better : after accidentally going ten days without touching her pores when she forgot to pack her tweezers for a trip , @entity16 managed to move away from her bad skin habit			1
she still sees a psychiatrist @entity16 was aware that her skin - picking was growing out of control and visited a ' battalion ' of dermatologists , who told her that her problem was psychosomatic			1
so she enrolled in an an outpatient program for mental health			0
but once the three - week program ended , she insisted she had her problem under enough control to move on her own to @entity6			1
the problem was not under control , however			0
though the dreaded magnifying mirror was back at her parents ' house in @entity46 , @entity16 would still lean in close to her own bathroom mirror to pick at her pores			1
' i would tweeze and squeeze , filling my garbage can with tissues dotted with blood , ' she writes , adding that she would hide out in her bedroom to avoid seeing her roommate , who might question her about the bloody tissues she threw out in the bathroom			0
and she did n't stop at using tweezers			0
@entity16 admitted that she 's also ' attacked ' her face with an extruder , an earring post , an unspooled paperclip , a pushpin , a toothbrush handle , the rough side of a nail file , lotion caps , and nail clippers			1
one of @entity16 's most agonizing memories was when the writer had to interview @entity125 after picking at a cyst on her chin until it bled			1
she worried the blood would n't dry in time to apply makeup before the interview			0
' the urge to self - injure just always pulses through my head and hands , ' she says			0
' and it 's my go - to method of procrastination when i have a deadline			0
' luckily , while travelling to the @entity139 in @entity140 this january , @entity16 forgot her tweezers at home , resulting in ten whole days during which she did n't pick at her face			1
now , the 27 - year - old says she has overcome her condition - and is working on being ' nice ' to herself			1
' i continue to work with a psychiatrist to stay on track since i first put the tweezers down , ' she says			1
@entity149 - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterized by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one 's skin			1
some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged			1
sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body			0
the condition is often categorized as an obsessive compulsive disorder ( @entity164 )			2
it can lead to bleeding , bruising and infections			0
@entity149 will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour			0
the skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels			0
however , once the damage has been done , those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness			0
although the damage that is caused can be very severe , the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out @entity149 again and again			0
treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy			0
