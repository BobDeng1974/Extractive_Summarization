while supporters will have gone home struggling to comprehend the events that had unfolded in front of them , @entity106 will have left @entity9 wondering when his side are going to stop giving away cheap goals			0
a better team than @entity15 might have eviscerated @entity14 here and , really , @entity122 ’s team had sufficient chances to make the eight - time winners of this competition pay the ultimate price : @entity68 almost knocked them out in the 85th minute when he hit the post			1
by that time , @entity15 – who arrived here buoyant on the back of a three - game winning spree – had pegged @entity14 back , @entity31 bulleting in a header from a wonderful free - kick by @entity34 in the 62nd minute after @entity48 had handled			1

‘ we made it hard for ourselves			0
but we showed resilience and it is job done			0
i do n’t need to jump up and down to celebrate			0

when @entity51 lofted a ball forward , @entity55 – captain for the night on what was his first @entity14 start – saw shot was blocked by the advancing @entity63			2
but the danger had not been cleared and @entity26 , showing remarkable poise for one so young , firmly and accurately returned his drive from 35 yards , the ball skidding past @entity63 , who made a ungainly attempt to salvage the situation on what was also his debut , into the unguarded net			1
for a moment , @entity26 – standing out from the crowd by wearing a simple pair of black boots – could not quite believe what had happened but then he took off , jumping with delight and racing over to celebrate by @entity106 , who was clapping his hands together in joyous approval			1
there has long been talk that @entity26 has the potential to become a fixture in @entity14 ’s first team in the future – @entity237 felt compelled to compare him on @entity238 to @entity239 in january 2013 – and , perhaps , in years to come this clip will be shown over and over again			1

@entity15 deserved their shot at extra-time but @entity14 found a rhythm that had been missing before and looked to have finally seen of their opponents in the 109th minute when @entity36 fired in			1
much to @entity106 bewilderment , however , there was to be another twist when @entity52 gave the ball away to @entity65 , who sent @entity41 clear			2
he was crudely brought down by @entity47 and kept his nerve to set up the shootout			1
