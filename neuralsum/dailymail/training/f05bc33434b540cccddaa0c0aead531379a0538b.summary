by @entity0 a five - year - old boy whose chronic diabetes meant he had never spoken said his first words just days after starting a ' miracle ' treatment			1
@entity6 suffered from health complications related to neonatal diabetes and it meant he could only communicate with his family through picture cards			1
but just six weeks after a genetic test by a team at the @entity14 he switched from insulin injections to tablets			0
@entity6 , far right , aged 14 , who was unable to speak until he was five due to neonatal diabetes			1
he is pictured with father @entity18 , brother @entity19 and mother @entity20 and then he delighted his family with his first words aged five , the simple phrase , ' hello mummy '			1
family life was then transformed from a ' living nightmare ' to a home filled with laughter after the diagnosis at the @entity29 , based at the @entity30 and @entity31			0
now aged 14 , @entity6 's diabetes is far easier to manage and he no longer has to prick his finger up to 15 times a day to check his blood sugar levels			1
his mother @entity36 , told her son 's story while taking part in an event , organised by the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , which brought together 34 families from across the world who have benefited from the same treatment			1
@entity6 , pictured here aged 17 days old , suffered from volatile blood sugar levels and mother @entity20 says he was often very ' whingey and whiney ' ms @entity36 said : ' it was just hideous			1
i 'm a nurse , and i had to work nights and my husband had to work days , so @entity6 always had someone with him who knew how to manage his diabetes			1
we had no family life			0
' we 'd wake up in the night with @entity6 completely manic because his blood sugar level was so high , or in convulsions on the floor because it was so low			2
' we could n't take part in normal activities because we had to take so much medication and bags of sugar , to account for any eventuality			2
' it was a living nightmare and we were all absolutely shattered			0
' @entity6 now aged 14 , with his mother @entity20 , who says he now ' never shuts up ! ' the turning point came when a relative spotted a newspaper report about a boy whose life had been transformed by his diagnosis by the @entity31 researchers , and by switching treatment			1
ms @entity36 , from @entity75 , contacted the @entity31 team , and soon had the diagnosis that changed everything			0
' at that point , @entity6 was still in nappies			2
he was often very whingey and whiney , and he never spoke			2
the condition is caused by a change in a gene which affects @entity84 means that levels of blood glucose ( sugar ) in the body rise dangerously high			0
the main feature of the condition is being diagnosed with diabetes under the age of six months around 20 per cent of people with neonatal diabetes also have some developmental delay or epilepsy			1
the treatment breakthrough came when scientists discovered that genetic mutations which lead to neonatal diabetes sometimes caused abnormalities in a channel within the pancreas			1
the abnormal channels are corrected by taking sulphonylurea tablets to allow the patient 's pancreatic cells to release their own insulin			0
to date , more than 300 people have been successfully treated across the world			0
' he made sounds and we communicated through a system of picture cards			1
' within just a few weeks of switching treatment , it became obvious that @entity6 's blood sugar levels were really stable			2
' he had stopped collapsing on the floor and he suddenly started smiling and laughing			0
' he turned into a really happy little chap			0
six weeks later he came out of school and all the staff were grinning from ear to ear			0
' he came up to me with this big smile on his face and said ' hello mummy ' - the first words he had ever spoken			2
' now he never shuts up ! @entity6 will always have severe special needs but now his diabetes just is n't an issue			1
for us , it really was a miracle			0
' neonatal diabetes is diagnosed within the first six months of life , and can be associated with complications such as severe learning difficulties or epilepsy			1
professors @entity140 and @entity142 , of the @entity29 , have funding from the @entity144 to continue this work into neonatal diabetes until at least 2020			1
professor @entity142 said : ' we 're delighted to welcome these families from all over the world to @entity31			0
' it 's always extremely gratifying and humbling to see first hand that research by the team at the @entity29 is yielding real benefits to families			0
' in many cases , their diagnosis and the switch from insulin injections to tablets has significantly improved blood sugar levels and allows them to eat a normal diet			0
' some have seen better muscle strength , concentration and sleep patterns			0
' this family day is a chance for us to learn from them about how clinical care can be improved , as well as to follow their progression			0
@entity6 has benefited from the breakthrough treatment at the @entity14 ' it 's also a valuable chance for families to get together and support each other			2
' dr @entity181 , @entity182 director of research , added : ' it 's really important to know if your child has neonatal diabetes so that they can start getting the tailored treatment they need			1
' we 're proud to have funded research that has led to a better understanding of the genetic causes of this rare condition , providing answers for parents and improving the lives of children affected			2

@entity6 suffered health complications related to neonatal diabetes
he was n't able to speak and could only communicate with picture cards
aged five he spoke his first words - ' hello mummy ' - after a new treatment
now aged 14 his condition is much easier to manage
his mother @entity20 says the research was a ' miracle ' for her son
