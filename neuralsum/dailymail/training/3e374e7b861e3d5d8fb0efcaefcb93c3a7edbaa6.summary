by @entity0 published : 03:22 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 15 april 2013 summer ice is melting 10 times faster in the @entity3 than it was 600 years ago , with the most rapid melt occurring in the past 50 years			1
researchers from the @entity6 and the @entity7 also discovered the ice melt is at its highest level in 1,000 years			2
' it 's definitely evidence that the climate and the environment is changing in this part of @entity3 , ' lead researcher @entity10 said			0
a one - metre long section of the @entity17 core , with a dark layer of volcanic ash visible			2
the teams drilled a 364 - metre ( 1,194 feet ) long ice core from @entity22 in the continent 's north to measure past temperatures in the area @entity10 and her team drilled a 364 - metre ( 1,194 feet ) deep ice core on @entity22 , near the northern tip of the @entity31 , to measure historical temperatures and compare them with summer ice melt levels in the area			1
visible layers in the ice core show periods when summer snow on the ice cap thawed and then refroze			1
they found that , while the temperatures have gradually increased by 1.6 degrees @entity43 ( 2.9 degrees @entity44 ) over 600 years , the rate of ice melting has been most intense over the past 50 years			1
experts said the stronger ice melts are likely to be responsible for faster glacier ice loss and some of the dramatic collapses from the @entity3 ice shelf over the past 50 years scientists at the @entity7 have produced the most detailed map yet of @entity53 s landmass , showing a landscape of mountain ranges and plains cut by gorges and valleys much deeper than previously seen that shows the ice melt can increase dramatically in climate terms once temperatures hit a tipping point			1
this is the first time it has been demonstrated that levels of ice melt on the @entity31 have been particularly sensitive to increasing temperature during the @entity68			1
scientists at the @entity7 have produced the most detailed map yet of @entity3 ’s landmass			0
@entity70 shows a landscape of mountain ranges and plains cut by gorges and valleys much deeper than previously seen			0
in addition , the map allows scientists to analyse , in much greater detail , the bed below the @entity3 ice sheet			0
the map reveals the volume of ice in @entity3 is 4.6 per cent greater than previously thought and that the the mean bed depth at 95 metres , is 60 metres lower than estimated			0
the volume of ice that is grounded with a bed below sea level is also 23 per cent greater than originally thought meaning there is a larger volume of ice that is susceptible to rapid melting			2
it also reveals the ice that rests just below sea level is vulnerable to warming from ocean currents			0
the new deepest point , under @entity94 , is around 400 metres deeper than the previously identified deepest point			0
' once your climate is at that level where it is starting to go above zero degrees , the amount of melt that will happen is very sensitive to any further increase in temperature you may have , ' @entity10 said			2
@entity104 , from the @entity7 , said the stronger ice melts are likely responsible for faster glacier ice loss and some of the dramatic collapses from the @entity3 ice shelf over the past 50 years			1
their research was published in the @entity112 journal			0
in other parts of @entity3 , such as the @entity17 , the picture is more complex and it is not yet clear that the levels of recent ice melt and glacier loss are exceptional or caused by human - driven climate changes			2
dr @entity10 concludes : ' this new ice core record shows that even small changes in temperature can result in large increases in the amount of melting in places where summer temperatures are near to 0 ° c , such as along the @entity31 , and this has import ' this research was funded by the @entity130			1
