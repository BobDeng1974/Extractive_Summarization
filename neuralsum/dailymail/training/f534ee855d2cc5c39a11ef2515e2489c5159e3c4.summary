by @entity0 smoking cannabis casually just one or two times a week can damage core structures of the brain , a study found smoking cannabis even casually can damage core structures of the brain , an authoritative study has found			1
just using the drug once or twice a week affects the size and shape of two key brain regions involved in emotion and motivation , the research shows			1
previous studies have focused on heavy users of cannabis – revealing that the active compound in the drug effectively ‘ rewires ’ the brain			1
but this is the first study that has revealed the impact of casual marijuana use			1
the scientists , from @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30 , analysed @entity32 brain scans of 20 young cannabis users aged 18 to 25			1
they compared them to the brain scans 20 young people who never smoked the drug			1
professor @entity39 , one of the researchers from @entity29 said : ‘ this study raises a strong challenge to the idea that casual marijuana use is not associated with bad consequences			1
’ the scientists found major differences in two brain areas , the nucleus accumbens and amygdala			2
both are linked to emotions and motivation , and also associated with addiction			2
in each case changes were seen that were directly related to how much cannabis was smoked			0
the nucleus accumbens of cannabis users was unusually large , while the amygdala was deformed			0
professor @entity39 said : ‘ some of these people only used marijuana to get high once or twice a week			2
‘ people think a little recreational use should n’t cause a problem , if someone is doing ok with work or school			0
our data directly says this is not the case			0
’ co-author dr @entity75 , from @entity28 , said : ‘ these are core , fundamental structures of the brain			1
they form the basis for how you assess positive and negative features about things in the environment and make decisions about them			0
’ the drug users in the study smoked cannabis at least once a week but were not psychologically dependent on their habit			1
the scientists , whose findings are reported in the @entity91 , believe the effects are the result of users ’ brains adapting to low - level exposure to cannabis			2
previous research has shown that rats given the psychoactive compound in cannabis , @entity98 , effectively have their brains rewired			0
psychologist dr @entity104 , who led the latest study , said : ‘ it may be that we ’re seeing a type of drug learning in the brain			1
casual use of the drug affects the size and shape of two key brain regions involved in emotion and motivation , scientists found			1
the study was the first to look solely at those using cannabis irregularly ‘ we think when people are in the process of becoming addicted , their brains form these new connections			0
’ drug addiction expert dr @entity126 , from the @entity127 , added : ‘ this study suggests that even light to moderate recreational marijuana use can cause changes in brain anatomy			1
‘ these observations are particularly interesting because previous studies have focused primarily on the brains of heavy marijuana smokers			0
’ dr @entity137 , of the @entity139 @entity138 , said : ‘ it ’s been known for some time that heavy cannabis use can affect the brain			0
‘ this new , well - conducted study has some really interesting and important results because it suggests that even moderate use of cannabis in young adults may be associated with changes in the brain			2
’ he said the study would inform separate scientific research that looks at the links between mental illness and cannabis use			2
he added : ‘ taken together , these studies therefore have implications for understanding some of the mental health problems that are associated with cannabis use including schizophrenia , particularly as the younger people are when they use start using cannabis , the higher the risk of mental illnesses down the line			0
’ professor @entity166 , professor of psychiatry at the @entity168 , said : ‘ this is an interesting piece of research			0
however , it is limited as it is only a small study			0
the main point is that , as usual , more research is needed			0

using drug once or twice a week affects core structures of the brain
affects brain regions involved in emotion and motivation , research shows
scientists analysed @entity32 brain scans of 20 users aged 18 to 25
first study to show impact of casual marijuana use on the brain
