by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 10:24 est , 15 january 2014 a species of shark long thought to be extinct has been rediscovered – lying dead on a slab in a @entity6 fish market			1
the incredibly rare smoothtooth blacktip shark was believed to have died out , with only one new example identified in the last 110 years			1
but a new survey of fish markets in @entity11 has turned up a staggering 47 examples of the mysterious shark , and although they were all dead and prepared for eating , scientists think they have collected enough information to prepare a conservation plan			1
discovery : the smoothtooth blacktip shark was believed to have died out until scientists began searching @entity6 fish markets ( pictured ) , where they found a staggering 47 examples before the @entity6 fish market finds , there were only ever two smoothtooth blacktip sharks positively identified			1
although the first was registered as a new species in 1985 , it was actually a specimen taken from a collection of dead animals assembled more than 80 years earlier by naturalist @entity30 during a trip to @entity32			0
until 2008 , the 1902 fish was the only known smoothtooth blacktip shark , despite scientists scouring @entity37 waters for new examples			2
during a @entity41 meeting in 2008 , a whaler shark described as ‘ very similar but different ’ to a smoothtooth blacktip shark was unveiled			0
the rare smoothtooth blacktip shark was registered as a new species in 1985 - although that was actually a specimen from an 83 - year - old collection			2
the 1902 fish was the only known example until the recent finds later analysis proved that the fish actually was a smoothtooth blacktip , but had initially been dismissed because it had been found in a @entity11 fish market - 1,800 miles from where @entity30 found his			0
the mysterious fish was actually discovered in a market named ‘ @entity56 ’ – a complete coincidence as the word means east in @entity59			0
the find led researchers to begin studying fish catches elsewhere in @entity6 , @entity63 and the @entity64 , as well as in markets around @entity32			1
after unearthing 47 varieties in @entity6 fish markets alone , the scientists were able to study how they grow , how many pups they can bear and how they most likely use their habitat			2
although the shark was relatively common in the markets , it is not considered cast - iron evidence of the smoothtooth blacktip being in rude health			0
as a result , the studies will now be used to create widespread conservation plans in an effort to increase the population .			0

smoothtooth blacktip shark was thought to have died out decades **ago**
there had been no examples since one found in @entity32 110 years **ago**
but a chance find led scientists to begin searching @entity6 fish markets
in the *aptly* - named ' @entity56 ' market , 47 smoothtooth blacktips were found
researchers now have enough information to begin conservation plans
