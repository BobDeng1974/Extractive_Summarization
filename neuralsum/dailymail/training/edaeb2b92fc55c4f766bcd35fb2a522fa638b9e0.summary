by @entity0 last updated at 10:22 pm on 12th january 2012 nestled in the picture perfect cotswolds , the parish of @entity2 is hardly the exotic location you might associate with such a beast			1
but , following the slaughter of a deer in the area and several apparent sightings , rumours are abounding that a big cat is stalking the fields and woods around the @entity16 village			1
@entity17 , an expert on big cats in @entity19 , examined the carcass of the six - month - old roe deer in nearby @entity22 , yesterday			1
he said it showed ‘ hallmarks of a big cat attack ’ , adding : ‘ the claw and teeth impressions are indicative of big cat activity			1
is this it ? this image of a large black animal was captured in a field in north - west @entity34 and could be the beast that is stalking a @entity16 village examination : a man completes a dna test on the carcass of the deer			2
experts said that the attack had the hallmarks of a big cat due to claw and teeth impressions ‘ and the stomach was taken out and discarded			1
@entity50 cats are strict carnivores so they do n’t want to eat the grass - filled intestines			0
’ @entity54 , which owns the land , is taking the theory so seriously it has ordered dna tests on the deer ’s remains to establish what killed it			0
mr @entity17 said the team was also investigating paw prints near the carcass			0
he said : ‘ there ’s a saying with paw prints that “ if it ’s round it is n’t a hound ” and these are quite round			0
’ suspicion was raised further yesterday after a dog walker claimed to have seen a big cat in a field half a mile from where the deer was found on january 4			1
the woman , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ it was jet black and at least the size of a @entity79 , very powerfully built and with large paws , a long tail and a smallish head			1
’ she is not the first to claim to have seen the ‘ wild cat of @entity2 ’ near the village , better known for being home to the largest @entity87 mosaic in @entity88			2
@entity89 , 72 , said he had seen a big black cat nearby seven times in the past ten years , most recently in 2010			1
mr @entity89 said : ‘ it ’s not a normal feral cat , this is different and bigger			2
’ a large , panther - like animal has been pictured in fields just over the county border in north - west @entity34			0
other recent sightings include a ‘ pure white predator ’ spotted in nearby @entity101 , just weeks before the deer was killed			0
@entity102 , who said he saw the beast , added : ‘ it was pure white			2
it almost looked like a polar bear			0
’ the dna tests are expected to be completed later this month .			0
