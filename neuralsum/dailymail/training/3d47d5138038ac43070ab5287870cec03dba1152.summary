by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 15:20 est , 8 january 2014 dr @entity2 outside @entity4 's court a @entity6 doctor who used a test banned in 2005 to check whether a feeding tube had been wrongly inserted into an 84 - year - old woman has been cleared of any negligence			1
an inquest into @entity13 's death found the feeding tube , which was mistakenly placed in her lungs , did contribute to her death on 15 december , 2012			1
but senior coroner @entity16 did not find dr @entity18 guilty of gross negligence - even though he used a whoosh test that was banned in @entity22 hospital in east @entity23 seven years ago following three patient alerts			1
giving a narrative conclusion , the coroner said : ' mrs @entity13 was an elderly lady and she clearly had some very significant natural disease			2
' having listened very , very carefully to all the evidence , i am persuaded that the misplacement of the naso - gastric tube was a contributing factor			2
' i am always going to look at the systems in a situation like this			0
the systems here were n't perfect , but i do think that the systems were good			0
' having really considered the matter , i am not going to write a report which aims to prevent future death			0
' the misplacement of the tube was not detected because of individual error			2
' i am satisfied on the balance of probablities the misplacement of the tube caused death , but i am not sure on that			2
because i ca n't be sure , i ca n't return a verdict of unlawful killing			0
@entity52 , a senior staff nurse at @entity53 ( left ) and nurse @entity54 ( right ) ' in order to find gross negligence , i must say the conduct was so bad that it was criminal and i do n't find that			1
' the inquest at @entity60 heard mrs @entity13 , who was born in 1928 in @entity61 and was a retired machine operator , died as a combination of a stroke and the misplacement of the tube			1
the medical cause of death given was pneumonia			0
the coroner continued : ' @entity13 died from a combination of natural disease and the consequence of a misplaced naso - gastric tube			1
' the tube was placed and she tested as having a @entity75 over eight			2
the senior nurse asked the consultant for an x ray but he chose to do a whoosh test			1
he was satisfied it was in the right place , it was not			0
' there was a patient alert in 2005 and two subsequent alerts directed the practise of using a whoosh test to detect the position of a naso - gastric tube must cease immediately			1
the trust found any patient with a @entity75 over five must have a chest x ray			2
' dr @entity18 was in contravention of the firm advice of a senior nurse , in contravention patient safety alerts dating back seven years , and in contravention of the hospital trust 's clear policy			1
' when the misplacement of the tube was discovered , nearly two litres of fluid was aspirated			0
the misplacement caused mrs @entity13 great distress			2
' dr @entity18 was asked by a senior nurse at the @entity53 to carry out a chest x-ray after a ph test on the feeding tube showed an abnormal amount			1
but the consultant carried out a whoosh test on @entity13 , which involves pumping air down a tube and listening for bubbles using a stethoscope			1
the grandmother and retired machinist , who suffered from diabetes and dementia , died 11 days later on december 15 , 2012 , from aspiration pneumonia at the east @entity23 hospital			1
daughter of @entity13 ( left ) and @entity126 ( right ) who died 11 days after the whoosh test giving evidence at @entity129 , dr @entity18 claims he was never shown hospital policy when he started in 2010 , and says the whoosh test is commonly used in @entity6 where medicine is ' more informal			1
' but the inquest heard dr @entity18 did not even attend an induction at @entity22 because he was working at @entity135 at the same time and timing was ' difficult '			1
he only completed the induction last year			0
he added : ' i learnt the whoosh test in medical school in 1993			1
i started medicine in 1993 and worked in @entity6 until 2010			0
' it is a very different system , it is very informal in @entity6			0
' the inquest heard how dr @entity18 was ' reluctant ' to do a chest x-ray because there could be a 24 - hour delay in feeding mrs @entity13 as the hospital ' does n't prioritise x-rays for feeding tubes			1
' dr @entity18 , who is still working full time at the hospital , then showed junior doctors how to carry out the ' rarely used ' test as he was not aware it has been discredited			1
he said : ' i showed them the test because it is something they have never seen because it is so rarely used			0
' it 's not taught anymore because it is technical and complex			0
' i said there is another way of checking the tube and if you do it properly , it is reliable			0
i said it is not normally done			0
' if [ i knew ] it was n't recommended , i would n't have taught students it			0
' for me , it sounded clear and the tube was in the right place and feeding had started			0
' he continued : ' i accept now it was hospital policy at the time for a chest x-ray			1
i never saw the trust policy for the tubes			0
i did n't know how to access trust policies			0
' i did n't know the whoosh test had been discredited			1
the misplaced feeding tube had been a ' contributory factor ' in her death , the hearing was told ' [ at the time ] i thought it was appropriate because i have vast experience and never had any complications			0
' presented with the same decision tomorrow , i would n't do the test			0
i would do the x-ray			0
' dr @entity194 also admitted he thought it was ' likely ' mrs @entity13 's health deteriorated as a result of the misplaced tube			1
@entity52 , a senior staff nurse at the @entity53 in @entity199 , east @entity23 , said dr @entity18 had carried out the ' whoosh test ' in front of junior doctors on mrs @entity204			1
' he did say to the junior doctors that it was not recommended , but he still felt that the whoosh test was reliable , ' nurse @entity52 told the inquest			1
she said the test dated back to the ' olden days ' and it was trust policy to carry out an x-ray where a test to show whether a feeding tube had been correctly inserted showed a litmus reading on a patient of over five			1
in the case of mrs @entity13 , she said her reading had been eight			2
senior coroner @entity16 did not find dr @entity18 guilty of gross negligence at @entity221 ' i asked dr @entity18 was he going to have an x-ray or not , he said to me " no " because he was happy the tube was in place and he wanted the patient to be fed as soon as possible , ' ms @entity227 told the inquest			1
but addressing the inquest dr @entity18 denied having said the whoosh test was ' not recommended			1
' ' i said there is another way of checking the position of an naso - gastric tube and if you do it properly , it is reliable			0
i said it is not normally done , ' he said			0
he said he had learned the ' whoosh test ' at medical school in @entity6 and had used it on several occasions in that country without problems			1
he added that if nurse @entity52 had informed him that it was trust policy to send a patient for an x-ray in these circumstances he would have complied			2
the inquest also heard evidence from dr @entity251 , who argued against the post mortem result , which found the misplaced tube was a contributing factor to mrs @entity13 's death			1
the stroke consultant at @entity22 said : ' events from the next day would all fit			0
it would explain the chest pain and so on but the tube was subsequently removed and there is a gap of 11 days of the placement of the tube and when the patient passes away			1
' i was a little surprised over the conclusion of the pathologist			0
i do n't feel there is enough evidence to say it caused mrs @entity13 's demise			2
' she continued : ' i do n't think the tube was a corroborating factor to the death			0
' mrs @entity13 was admitted to the hospital after suffering a stroke and had been plagued by ill health long before her death - including being at risk ' every day ' of pneumonia , the inquest heard			1
earlier , the inquest heard from staff nurse @entity54 who reinserted the feeding tube on december 4 , 2012 , after it had come out of mrs @entity13			1
she said she had contacted nurse @entity52 to alert her of the litmus reading and asked for her to request a chest x-ray to find out whether the tube was correctly positioned			1
dr @entity289 , a specialist clinical negligence lawyer acting for mrs @entity13 ’s family , said they wanted answers as to how such a ' never event ' could have happened			2
mrs @entity13 lived with her daughter and granddaughter in @entity297 , @entity23			2
' feeding a patient down a tube misplaced into the lungs is a so - called " never event " which means an event that the @entity304 says it has resolved to prevent ever from occurring by having proper precautions in place , ' he said			0
' yet such an event has happened here			0
quite understandably , the family are looking for answers as to how this could happen and lead to mrs @entity13 ’s death			2
' medical director at the hospital dr @entity313 passed his wishes on to the family : ' she was distressed over being admitted to an intensive care unit , which is a horrible experience for anyone			2
' in relatives , i have seen on the @entity321 , it is a state of post traumatic stress disorder - it is that level of stress			0
' irrespective , this incident clearly had an impact			0
it led to admission in @entity321 and was associated with her death			0
' all the family understood her life expectancy was limited but this is something they felt very bad about			0
' dr @entity313 assured the coroner steps have been at the hospital - including documents on feeding tubes - since mrs @entity13 's death .			2
