@entity1 boss @entity0 believes saturday 's opponents @entity3 can still win the @entity5 title this season despite a poor start to the campaign			1
@entity10 's side are clearly outsiders to lift the trophy after the @entity15 coach 's bedding - in period left them eight points behind leaders @entity18 , who are fighting it out with @entity19 at the top			1
@entity3 have looked suspect in defence for much of the season but recent signs of improvement have convinced @entity0 they should not be written off			1
@entity3 go in to saturday 's game against @entity1 off the back of a 3 - 0 win over @entity28 it was @entity3 's sixth straight @entity5 win to leave them third in the table ' they might not be able to lose many more games if they are going to win the title but they 're certainly in with a shout , ' said the @entity1 boss			1
' it is still a brilliant club with great players			0
the players they have brought in , there are not many teams in world football who can do that			0
they 're a really good side			0
' the @entity48 have now won six matches in a row to significantly close the gap between themselves and their two rivals and now look a lot healthier than they did under @entity56 last season			2
' just because they 've changed managers does n't change my thinking of that football club , ' @entity0 added			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 thinks @entity3 can still win the league this season @entity10 's side are eight points behind leaders @entity18 after making a poor start to the campaign ' @entity18 and @entity19 have lost less games			1
but if @entity3 do n't win it they will certainly have a big say in who does			2
' if we win tomorrow it 's good for us , that 's the most important thing			0
we have to win for ourselves , it 's got nothing to do with stopping @entity3			2
' @entity1 will be without three players through suspension when they welcome @entity81 's side			1
on - loan @entity82 , who would not have been allowed to play against his parent club anyway , is banned alongside @entity85 and @entity86			0
@entity93 ( knee ) , @entity87 ( hamstring ) , @entity89 ( calf ) and @entity91 ( knee ) are all injured , but captain @entity95 and midfielder @entity96 are available after both returned from injury last weekend .			0
