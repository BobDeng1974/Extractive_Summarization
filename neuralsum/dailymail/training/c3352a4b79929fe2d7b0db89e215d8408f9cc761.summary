all that remains now is for either @entity2 or @entity17 to wrap up the drivers ' crown , with the former 17 points clear following a ninth win of the campaign			1
addressing the future , and the possibility of recruiting @entity10 , @entity0 said : ' we have a contract with both our drivers for 2015 , and we want to continue with the current line - up			0
@entity2 currently leads his @entity1 team - mate @entity17 ( left ) by 17 points in the @entity42 standings ' that is because these two boys are part of the success of the team , they know each other so well and they respect each other			1
