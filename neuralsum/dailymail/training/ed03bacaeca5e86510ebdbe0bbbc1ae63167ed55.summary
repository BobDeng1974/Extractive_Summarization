by @entity0 published : 03:47 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 07:15 est , 29 october 2012 patients at an @entity3 hospital will receive ' bills ' to see what they would have paid if their treatment had been private			1
the controversial scheme at @entity8 is to raise awareness of how much various tests , procedures and visits cost			0
it is hoped that this will deter time - wasters			0
@entity16 , chief executive of the trust that runs @entity19 said he hoped the move would encourage patients to ' value ' and ' appreciate ' the service			1
unexpected : patients may soon receive fake bills to raise awareness of how much treatments actually cost mr @entity16 wants to introduce printouts of costs next year			1
he said : ' i do n't think people recognise the value of what we have in the @entity3			1
one visit to @entity36 for painkillers alone costs the @entity3 £ 150			1
' what we get for free , we often take for granted			0
it 's reminding people how precious the @entity3 is			1
' we have people coming into @entity36 for paracetamol because they have a headache			2
it costs an @entity36 visit for something they could get for pennies			0
we still prescribe paracetamol for people			2
is that right when most people have it at home in their cupboards ? ' the trust , which runs @entity19 and @entity58 in nearby @entity59 , is under pressure to save £ 99m			2
mr @entity16 : @entity61 up of people attending @entity36 to get paracetamol for a headache the efficiency savings have to be made by 2018 and include ward closures and bed losses			2
mr @entity16 said the budget for one person 's health each year in @entity71 is about £ 1,700			0
but some patients need more treatment than others , depending on their condition or problem , and the cost of operations , procedures and tests vary			2
' some people will be surprised by what they think is a tiny cost , ' said mr @entity16			0
' it 's a lot of money and some people will be staggered			0
' i want people to recognise the value and preciousness of what we have and see if it helps us all make better choices , make people stop and think about what we need to do differently			1
' the @entity3 is all of ours and when somebody has been through @entity36 eight times in a month , it 's a lot of money			1
but i do n't want people to feel this is a disincentive for coming in			1
mr @entity16 wants to bring in the scheme for patients treated at the @entity19 ' it 's so people make the best use of the @entity3 and appreciate it			1
if you had been in the @entity110 , you would have had to pay for it			0
' if some care could have been given somewhere that is just as good but cheaper , is hospital the right place to be ? ' the hospital needs to be there when you need it			0
' we do fantastic things and save lives but we also spend £ 500m a year as a trust			0
' we want people to be aware of the valuable resources we have and use them more wisely			0

' @entity125 ' will *reveal* what patients would have paid if they had gone private
' i do n't think people recognise the value of what we have in the @entity3 , ' says @entity135 chief
