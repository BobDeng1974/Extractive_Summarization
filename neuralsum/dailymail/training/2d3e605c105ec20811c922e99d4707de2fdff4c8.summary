all she can do every day now is stay in bed			0
the staff come and turn her over every two hours			0
’ mr @entity16 said ms @entity6 ’s drinking problems started in her early 20s , during a series of troubled relationships			1
‘ when i met her i took her drinking as part of her , it 's something i got used to , ’ he said			2
‘ when she got up and had a can in her hand straight away , i got immune to it			0
to her it was like having a cup of tea			0
ms @entity6 ( pictured before alcohol ravaged her body ) has four children but they have all been taken into care ‘ @entity6 has four beautiful children , they are now aged six to 15 , and they have all been taken into care because she ca n't look after them			2

‘ it is always regrettable when we have to take a decision based on a patient 's safety which does n't meet the hopes of their family			2

ms @entity6 wants to return home to die but her partner has been told it would be too expensive to provide care for her outside of the nursing home ‘ the bottom line is , good quality help is available in @entity18 and @entity142 , and the earlier someone can access that help the better , ’ mr @entity90 added			1
there are currently concerns about soaring rates of liver disease in @entity148			1

across all age groups , an extra 1,000 people with alcohol - related liver damage are being admitted to hospitals in @entity159 each year			2
experts say few of these would be regarded by other members of the public as alcoholics			0
