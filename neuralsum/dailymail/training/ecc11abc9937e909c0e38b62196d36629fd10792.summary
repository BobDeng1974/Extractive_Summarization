@entity14 argued the @entity15 public would want proper trials and @entity16 thought they would provide good propaganda			1
the @entity10 agreed to the hearings , despite fears they could set a dangerous example			0
talks : @entity1 ( left ) was said to have been swayed against the idea for summary executions at the @entity28 ' conference in 1945 by @entity15 president @entity14 ( centre ) and @entity16 ( right ) the 1940s and 1950s diary was by @entity32 head of counter-espionage @entity33 , who backed a plan from @entity36 ( @entity36 ) sir @entity37 to ‘ bump off ’ certain @entity38			1
he dictated an entry in june 1945 about talks with a member of the @entity43 , an @entity45 official and a @entity47 representative over a war crimes prosecution			2
mr @entity33 said the @entity36 wanted a committee to ‘ come to the conclusion that certain people should be bumped off and that others should receive varying terms of imprisonment ’ , reported the @entity50			1
this would have been put to the @entity57 - and ‘ any military body finding these individuals in their area ’ would have had authority to ‘ arrest them and inflict whatever punishment had been decided on ’			0
key hearings : the @entity65 were a defining moment in international justice that saw the 21 defendants accused of acts such as crimes against peace and humanity , and abuse and murder of prisoners trial : the accused included @entity78 ( pictured in the dock ) , commander of the @entity80 ; admiral @entity81 , who became president of @entity83 after @entity85 's death ; and @entity85 's close friend @entity86 ‘ this was a much clearer proposition and would not bring the law into disrepute , ’ mr @entity33 said			2

' @entity97 supported @entity14 on the perfectly frank ground that the @entity99 liked public trials for propaganda purposes			2
source : the 1940s and 1950s diary was by @entity32 head of counter-espionage @entity33 ' it seems to me that we are just being dragged down to the level of the travesties of justice that have been taking place in the @entity17 for the past 20 years			1
’ a year later mr @entity33 flew to @entity7 with @entity114 deputy head @entity113 to witness 21 senior nazis prosecuted - and felt his concerns about a show trial had been confirmed , reported the @entity50			1
‘ one can not escape the feeling that most of the things the 21 are accused of having done over a period of 14 years , the @entity99 have done over a period of 28 years , ’ he wrote in the diary			0
mr @entity33 said this contributed to the ‘ somewhat phoney atmosphere of the whole proceedings ’			2
he added that the experience led to one of the biggest worries for him , that the court was ' one of the victors who have framed their own charter , their own procedure and their own rules of evidence in order to deal with the vanquished '			0
the @entity65 were a defining moment in war crimes justice that saw the 21 defendants accused of acts such as crimes against peace and humanity , and murder of prisoners			0
