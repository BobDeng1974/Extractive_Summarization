the @entity10 presenter and @entity11 comic - whose tongue - in - cheek 10 reasons why ... series has had 4.6m hits , gained 30,000 subscribers , and prompted belly - laughs all over the world - has come up with a new list of theories pointing out the real reasons why you 're still unattached			1
and they include being needy , acting like a bit of a ' lad ' , jumping into bed with men too quickly , intimidating potential suitors with your success ... and having far too many cuddly toys			1

@entity40 ( ' i 'm not sure how much help he 's going to be since he ca n't stand up by himself ' ) watches as his auntie rattles through the reasons why women are single , and they include drinking too much , smelling bad , looking a bit of a mess , being too fussy , and simply going after the wrong type of man			0
this week baby nephew @entity40 helps @entity4 explain why single women stay ... single filming in high definition camera for the first time , the popular ( and often controversial ) chatterbox explains that there is ' a certain stigma ' attached to being single			2
she goes on to demonstrate why being too needy is ' apparently not an attractive quality in a woman ' ; how owning too many cuddly toys and ' treating them like people ' can be quite frightening to a man ; that ' getting smashed ' alcohol is for some reason not pretty ; that men can be scared of a woman 's success ; that men can be scared of a woman 's face ; and that bad smell can put off a man			1
drinking too much is apparently not an attractive quality in a woman @entity4 says perhaps you smell , are too needy and need to many compliments ... maybe ' you slept with them too quickly and did n't make them earn it ' , or perhaps you 're too fussy and pick holes in every man you see ... or could it be that you simply pick the wrong guys ? she ends the video explaining that men seem to like ' girly - girls ' they can look after , and that if you 're too much of a lad or tomboy ( like @entity4 says she is ) , they might be turned off			1
