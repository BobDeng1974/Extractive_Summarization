@entity0 has thanked @entity2 's hierarchy for their continued investment in his squad rather than dishing him out a dressing down for the club 's poor start to the season			1
@entity9 is yet to taste victory in the @entity2 hotseat with two defeats and two draws from his opening four games in charge			2
the @entity16 are currently 14th in the @entity17 with two points after three matches , but the @entity21 's low point in his early tenure at @entity23 came in a humiliating 4 - 0 thrashing at @entity26 side @entity25 in the @entity28 second round			2
the spending spree at @entity23 has come as a welcome surprise to @entity9 who recieved a heavy rollicking for a similar poor start whilst in charge of @entity42 by general manager @entity43			1
stellar signing : @entity30 is one of @entity9 's summer transfers to @entity23 - all smiles : @entity34 joined @entity2 in a £ 14million move from @entity48 on transfer deadline day ' my start at @entity42 was just as bad as my start with @entity2			1
but the big differenre was that at @entity42 i had already been called in for a major showdown with director @entity43 , who wanted an explanation , ' he told the @entity57			2
' and what have united done ? they have just bought more players for me			0
' that is a sign of trust in the manager			0
i feel their trust and belief in my ability			0
it is not just a matter of believing in my football philosophy , but in me as a person too			0
' like our dedicated @entity2 facebook page			0
under pressure : @entity9 was given a dressing down whilst at @entity42 after a similar poor start			1
