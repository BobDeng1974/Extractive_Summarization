where do @entity0 go from here ? @entity4 ’s team still face unanswered questions less than 10 months out from the @entity6 and defeat next week against @entity7 would complete a hat - trick of losses to the @entity11 super powers			1
@entity13 ’s team began their @entity6 countdown with famous wins over @entity16 , @entity7 and @entity17 on successive weekends but @entity20 ’s team appear miles behind			1
here @entity21 speaks to series of former players and coaches to get their take on where @entity0 must learn and improve if they want to be contenders at next year ’s tournament			1
@entity0 ’s 2003 winning flanker , former captain @entity28 , 71 @entity0 caps , 3 @entity30 caps take the chances presented to you @entity0 ’s driving maul and set - piece play has been very effective but they are not using that ball anywhere near wisely enough			1
the frustrating thing is that @entity0 have created chances against @entity17 and @entity16 , but have not taken them			2
i ’m thinking of @entity41 ’s dropped pass against @entity16 and @entity42 not straightening and giving a pass against @entity17			0
those moments make or break you at the highest level			0
@entity0 failed to take their big chances against @entity17 and @entity16 attack the gainline if you watch @entity16 closely then you ’ll see how many times a forward carries the ball up at first receiver before off - loading out of the tackle to a second runner on their shoulder			1
it may only take them two or three metres past the gainline but it means they always have quick ball			0
at the moment @entity0 ’s runners are on their own and getting isolated			2
they have to work on that area because if we can generate quick ball there are exciting runners who can thrive on it			0
back - row needs competition i would have liked to have seen a different player at @entity74 against @entity75 because we need to know what someone like @entity77 , @entity78 or @entity79 can do in that key position			1
if @entity83 gets injured then there is no obvious replacement in that position			2
@entity86 is also a player i ’d be pulling all the stops out to get involved ahead of the @entity6			2
at the moment @entity0 ’s back row feels a bit predictable and i ’d like to see some other players being given an opportunity in that area			1
ultimately we know what players like @entity95 can do			0
i understand why they ’ve picked him but there are other players out there @entity0 need to learn about			2
@entity0 should pull out all the stops to get @entity86 in the team beat @entity7 it ’s not all doom and gloom with this @entity0 team			1
@entity4 will have learned a lot about his players in this series — not all of it good — and will have a clearer idea about which players can survive at the highest level			0
but they have to start winning soon , starting with @entity7 next week , because otherwise the rot can set in very quickly			0
@entity118 scrum - half , @entity120 commentator @entity119 , 26 @entity0 caps , 3 @entity30 caps build on the set piece @entity0 will always produce yeomen for the team to build a platform off , but at the moment @entity0 are wasting their hard - earned set - piece possession			1
despite injuries to guys like @entity131 and @entity132 , the pack is still rock solid so why on earth are n’t the backs doing anything when they have it ? @entity0 have one of the best openside flankers in the world in @entity86 breakdown — bring back @entity86 i watched the @entity17 game alongside @entity141 and @entity142 and i can tell you they were tearing their hair out at the lack of balance in @entity0 ’s back row			1
@entity83 is a fine workhorse but he is out of position at @entity74 and @entity0 ’s breakdown work is suffering as a result			1
in @entity0 have one of the best openside flankers in the world , but he ’s kicking his heels in @entity154 because of this selection ruling			2
@entity4 — who i ’m a big admirer of by the way — has to change his policy on this or @entity0 will never produce the quick ball they crave			2
the @entity161 conundrum i ’m sorry but it really does seem to be one rule for one and one rule for another in terms of selection at the moment			0
@entity171 has a couple of bad games and is booted out of the squad while @entity161 — who is patently not fit — is just as bad but gets shifted to inside centre			0
am i missing something here ? for me , @entity161 is not even the best attacking fly - half at his club , where @entity179 is superb , and he is very fortunate to get another go at inside centre			0
i hope that midfield combination works , but i fear @entity161 is just too functional where @entity0 need creativity and world - class distribution			1
@entity161 was very fortunate to get another go at inside centre the need for speed if @entity0 are going to pick @entity161 they have to have speed everywhere around him and at the moment that is not the case			2
@entity194 is another trusted workhorse but where is the searing pace that @entity0 ’s midfield and wingers should provide			2
i do n’t understand why @entity200 does n’t get a look in			0
i ’d have picked @entity203 ’s midfield of @entity204 , @entity200 and @entity205 for last night ’s clash			0
@entity0 ’s @entity207 winning coach sir @entity13 , 21 @entity0 caps , 2 @entity30 caps width @entity0 are simply not getting enough width on the ball and that is largely down to them not having played a ball - playing 12			1
i believe @entity161 can do that job and i ’m excited @entity0 have finally gone down that path of two playmakers in the midfield			2
look at every great team in the world , they all play that way , and @entity0 must stick with that combination going forward			1
breakdown i ’m a huge advocate of @entity86 and i find it utterly baffling the @entity224 wo n’t make an exception for such a world - class talent			1
@entity0 ’s back - row balance is not right at the moment , with the excellent @entity83 much better suited to the blindside flank , and yet they have this world - class talent across the channel who is ready and willing to play			1
question marks over @entity161 's fitness means @entity0 should pick @entity236 go for broke : pick @entity236 @entity236 is such a talented fly - half who has produced consistent performances for @entity240 for more than a year now			1
i ’m a big fan of @entity161 when he ’s fit and firing while @entity204 has huge potential with his quick feet and good hands			0
but for me , @entity236 is a cut above any other fly - half in @entity0 and he now has experience to add to undoubted quality			1
why wo n’t @entity0 pick him ? pace at 13 if @entity0 are going to play @entity161 at @entity248 , they simply must pick a flyer at 13			0
@entity194 is not that man			0
when fit , @entity251 has all the credentials in terms of pace and size , but if he is not in the side , @entity0 need to discover a 13 with pace to burn			0
@entity0 ’s 2003 @entity6 winner and former captain @entity259 , 73 @entity0 caps , 5 @entity30 caps come in @entity74 the openside spot still bothers me but that will be a constant dialogue until the @entity6			1
if @entity83 falls over on the eve of the tournament then @entity20 will have to throw in a rookie			0
even @entity16 rotate @entity269 with @entity270 and if he is unavailable , then they have a ready - made re-placement			0
saturday 's game against @entity75 should have been an occasion for @entity20 to look at another option whether that be @entity79 , @entity276 or ... @entity86			0
find the extra edge the difficulty at that level is to work out where you can find that extra couple of per cent from , either within yourself or the team			0
you are the best man in the country in your position , that is why you have been picked , but you have a duty to look at your game and mindset and work out where you can get those marginal gains from			0
under @entity13 we had the constant message of trying to find those extra ‘ one percenters ’ , the @entity0 players must adopt that mindset and find the belief .			1

@entity28 says @entity0 need @entity86 in the back row
sir @entity13 urges @entity0 to make exception for @entity302 forward
@entity259 wants back - up for captain @entity83
