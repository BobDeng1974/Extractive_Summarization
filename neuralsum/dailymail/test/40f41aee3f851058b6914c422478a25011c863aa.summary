@entity0 has spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light - years away , making it one of the most distant planets ever found			1
known as ' @entity3 , ' the gas giant was detected by the @entity4 and the @entity5 in @entity6			0
the planet is half as massive as @entity8 and could help astronomers gain a better understanding of the distribution of planets in the @entity13			1
astronomers have spotted one of the most distant planets ever found			1
known as ' @entity3 , ' the gas giant was detected by the @entity4 and the @entity5 in @entity6			0
most of the planets we know about are around 10 - 100 times closer the planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing			1
this happens when one star happens to pass in front of another , and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star 's light			0
if that foreground star happens to have a planet in orbit around it , the planet might cause a blip in the magnification			0
astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light - years away in the central bulge of our galaxy , where star crossings are more common			1
most of the planets we know about are around 10 - 100 times closer than @entity47 , claims @entity48 of the @entity49			1
' we do n't know if planets are more common in our galaxy 's central bulge or the disk of the galaxy , which is why these observations are so important , ' she added			1
the discovery demonstrates that @entity57 - from its unique perch in space - can be used to help solve the puzzle of how planets are spread out in our galaxy			1
the planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing			1

astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light - years away in the central bulge of our galaxy , where star crossings are more common			1
our sun is located in the suburbs of the galaxy , about two - thirds of the way out from the centre			2
the microlensing technique as a whole has yielded about 30 planet discoveries so far , with the farthest residing about 25,000 light - years away			1
' @entity95 experiments are already detecting planets from the solar neighborhood to almost the center of the @entity13 , ' said co-author @entity99 of the @entity100 , @entity101			1
' and so they can , in principle , tell us the relative efficiency of planet formation across this huge expanse of our galaxy			0
' this infographic explains how the @entity4 can be used in tandem with a telescope on the ground to measure the distances to planets			2
the planet was dicovered via microlensing which happens when one star passes in front of another , and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify the more distant star 's light @entity95 complements other planet - hunting tools , such as the @entity123 mission , which has found more than 1,000 planets closer to home			1
but it faces one key problem : this method ca n't always precisely narrow down the distance to the stars and planets being observed			2
while a passing star may magnify the light of a more distant star , it rarely can be seen itself , making the task of measuring how far away it is challenging			0
of the 30 planets discovered with microlensing so far , roughly half can not be pinned down to a precise location			1
the result is like a planetary treasure map lacking in @entity143 's			0
that 's where @entity57 can help out , thanks to its remote @entity148 - trailing orbit			2
@entity57 circles our sun , and is currently about 128 million miles ( 207 million km ) away from @entity148			0
that 's farther from @entity148 than @entity148 is from our sun. when @entity57 watches a microlensing event simultaneously with a telescope on @entity148 , it sees the star brighten at a different time , due to the large distance between the two telescopes and their unique vantage points			1
this technique is generally referred to as parallax			0
' @entity57 is the first space telescope to make a microlens parallax measurement for a planet , ' said @entity48			0
data from the microlensing event is seen here			2
if the foreground star is circled by a planet , the planet 's gravity can alter the magnification over a shorter period , seen in the plot in the form of spikes and a dip ' traditional parallax techniques that employ ground - based telescopes are not as effective at such great distances			2
' using space telescopes to observe microlensing events is tricky			2
ground telescopes send out alerts to the astronomy community when an event starts , but the activity can quickly fade , lasting on average about 40 days			0
in the case of the newfound planet , the duration of the microlensing event happened to be unusually long , about 150 days			2
both @entity57 and @entity193 's telescopes detected the telltale planetary blip in the magnification , with @entity57 seeing it 20 days earlier			0
this time delay between viewing of the event by @entity193 and @entity57 was used to calculate the distance to the star and its planet			0
knowing the distance allowed the scientists also to determine the mass of the planet , which is about half that of @entity8			0
' we 've mainly explored our own solar neighborhood so far , ' said @entity209 , a @entity210 at @entity0 's @entity211			0
' now we can use these single lenses to do statistics on planets as a whole and learn about their distribution in the galaxy			1

most of the planets we know about are around 10 - 100 times closer
@entity224 was spotted due to its ' microlensing ' effect
similar finds could help reveal the distribution of planets in the @entity13
