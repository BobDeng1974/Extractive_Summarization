precision guided firearms that can automatically aim at targets ? terrifyingly , there ’s an app for that			0
known as @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , @entity9 firm @entity8 ’s software is used to enable an advanced array of weaponry			1
and in a new video , one @entity14 user shows how @entity10 lets him hit a smartphone with a rifle from one kilometre ( 0.62 miles ) away			1
others can even follow along with the action on an @entity31 app on an @entity32 or an @entity33 ( pictured ) in the video @entity14 user @entity34 is firing the @entity37 , which he says is the ‘ largest - calibre @entity38 available today			1
’ a laser rangefinder is used by the shooter looking through the scope to identify the target that he or she wants to hit			1
the high - tech sight then takes into account humidity , wind and the typical ballistic drop you 'd expect from a bullet fired over such a distance			0
once the target has been selected , the scope provides cross-hairs which have to be lined up with the pin that is dropped on the target			0
to ensure accuracy , the shooter can not even squeeze the trigger unless the cross-hairs and pin are alined			0
the rifle employs the aforementioned @entity10 targeting system , which boasts a range of up to 1.1 kilometres ( 0.68 miles )			1
using the system allows for accurate and precise shots of a distant target - even one as small as a smartphone			2
to shoot at something , the shooter first ' marks ' it using a button near the trigger			0
marking a target illuminates it with the tracking scope 's built - in laser , and the target gains a red pin in the scope 's display			2
the scope then provides cross-hairs that have to be lined up with the pin , with the shooter not able to pull the trigger unless the two are aligned			0
in the video @entity14 user @entity34 fires several shots at an @entity90 ( stock image shown ) , highlighting the impressive level of accuracy of the gun			1
he mentions , though , that the central dot is quite big so at a distance of one kilometre ( 0.62 miles ) it is hard to know which part of the phone he is shooting at the @entity103 military has been testing out some of the @entity104 ( pictured ) with a view to employing them in the field in the future			0
back in january it was reported they acquired six $ 27,000 ( £ 16,000 ) smart rifles from @entity9 - based @entity8 the rifle also offers an @entity31 app that connects to the scope via a mobile @entity116 network and streams the scope 's display to the app , allowing someone with an @entity33 or @entity32 to act as a spotter and for videos to be uploaded to the @entity123			1
this allows hunters to gain instant advice on their aim from experts using the @entity123 and more interestingly allows shooters to video anything they shoot on an expedition and upload it onto the web as proof			0
the makers of the rifle also claim that the gun is safer than a standard bolt action rifle			2
this is because a large number of injuries are caused by recoiling guns fired by nervous shooters with twitch fingers			0
@entity8 ’s rifle increases the pull strength of the trigger until the target is aligned			1
in this way , the hunter is more likely to hit their target and accidental firings can be largely avoided			0
the smart rifles can shoot even if the target is moving as fast as 10 miles ( 16 kilometres ) per hour			2
all of @entity8 ’s firearms use the company ’s @entity10 system – which tracks range , drop , magnus effect , spindrift , coriolis effect , direction , cant , inclination , pressure , temperature , humidity , muzzle velocity , barrel length and twist , lock time , ballistic coefficient and drag coefficient .			1

a new @entity14 video shows off a @entity38 ( @entity1 )
@entity34 shoots a smartphone with a smart rifle from *1km* away
the gun uses @entity8 's aiming software known as @entity10
this enables a shooter to ' paint ' and hit a *stationary* or moving target
the software can help *people* more easily become expert marksmen
