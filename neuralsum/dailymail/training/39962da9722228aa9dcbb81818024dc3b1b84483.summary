@entity0 came off the bench and scored twice to rescue @entity2 from another ignominious defeat but the fans ’ discontent with manager @entity6 remains evident and doubts about his future will continue			1
@entity9 gave @entity10 the lead early in the second half with a stunning volley and @entity14 hit a screamer to hand them what looked a decisive advantage			1
but @entity0 ’s heroics saved the day , and perhaps @entity6 , certainly for now			1
there were protests against him beforehand , in pubs and around the ground , but inside the stadium they were limited and sporadic , and the manager was grateful for that small mercy			0
@entity28 international @entity0 proved the hero for @entity2 in saturday 's 2 - 2 @entity31 draw against @entity10 @entity0 ( second right ) tapped home from close range to give his side a share of the spoils against the @entity37 @entity0 ( centre ) is mobbed by his fellow @entity2 team - mates after earning his side a draw on saturday @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity41 5.5 ; @entity42 6.5 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 6 ; @entity46 6 , @entity47 7.5 ( @entity48 85 ) ; @entity49 4.5 , @entity50 5.5 , @entity51 6 ( @entity52 90 ) ; @entity53 5 ( @entity0 69 , 8.5 ) subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 booked : @entity50 , @entity49 , @entity48 goals : @entity0 73 , 87 manager : @entity6 7 @entity10 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity61 5.5 ; @entity62 6.5 , @entity63 6 , @entity64 7 , @entity65 8 ( @entity66 88 ) ; @entity67 6.5 , @entity68 7 , @entity69 7.5 , @entity70 6.5 ; @entity9 7 ( @entity71 81 ) , @entity72 5 ( @entity73 55,6.5 ) subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 goals : @entity9 49 , @entity69 68 booked : @entity65 , @entity80 manager : @entity82 6.5 man - of - the - match : @entity0 referee : @entity85 ( @entity86 ) 7 ‘ i have to say thank you to the fans for that , ’ he said			1
‘ a lot of them took a neutral position			0
i do n’t expect them to cheer for me but they took a position to support their club			0
’ small bursts of protest peppered the game , from chants of ‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ’ from sections of @entity2 ’s fans to ‘ we want @entity6 out ! ’ on a couple of occasions @entity6 was required to kick or hit the ball back into play from touchline , and was jeered			1
at 2 - 0 down a supporter with a piece of @entity115 paper adorned with an @entity111 slogan walked behind the dugout and shouted ‘ @entity6 , @entity6 ! ’ to try to get @entity6 to look up			1
he did not , and a steward shepherded the fan away			0
‘ it was a tough day , ’ @entity6 said			2
‘ but i ’ve had to approach it as a normal working day			0
’ he accepted that some of the criticism had been merited given some recent results , such as last week ’s 4 - 0 drubbing at @entity125			1
‘ we ca n’t moan about it because we ’ve brought it on ourselves , ’ he said			0
he also said that the health crisis of @entity131 midfielder @entity130 , who revealed he is receiving treatment for testicular cancer , put matters into perspective			1
‘ sometimes in desperate situations , like @entity130 ’s illness is , it can bind you together , ’ @entity6 said			1
yet the pre-match talk of the @entity142 was all about @entity6 , mass protests , a dedicated website — @entity145 — to have him removed and of threats that 30,000 protest sheets and 100 huge banners would be on display			1
they were not , in the ground at least			0
the fans ’ reasons for wanting @entity6 sacked include ‘ increasingly poor results over the past two years ’ , his ‘ deceit and empty promises ’ , ‘ mismanagement of the club and the playing staff ’ and ‘ his misrepresentation of our hopes and expectations ’			2
certainly , results have not been good			0
since @entity2 beat @entity10 4 - 1 in march in a match remembered for @entity6 butting the midfielder , @entity71 , @entity2 have won just two of 15 @entity31 games			1
in 24 league games played in the calendar year , they have failed to score in 15			0
@entity2 started brightly yesterday and they had the first chance in the fifth minute after @entity51 ’s run and @entity49 ’s cross led to @entity53 ’s header , which flew over			2
@entity51 and @entity174 then combined to set up @entity46 , whose shot was saved , and after a @entity50 run , @entity42 crossed from the right to @entity51 , whose header was also saved			0
the home crowd began to get restless			0
early dominance with no end product , allied with errors that were giving @entity10 chances , made them restless and in the 32nd minute the first loud , concerted chants of ‘ we want @entity6 out ! ’ began			1
@entity10 increased the tension in the 48th minute thanks to a magnificent finish by @entity9 who leapt into the air and smashed the ball home from 15 yards with his right foot after being fed a ball from his right			1
‘ we want @entity6 out ! ’ roared the crowd			2
the @entity31 clash was shrouded by a poisonous atmosphere from @entity2 supporters who want manager @entity6 ( right ) sacked @entity2 supporters protested inside the ground during the match to show their disgust at the management of @entity6 @entity10 striker @entity9 opened the scoring with the clash at @entity2 with a stunning overhead strike at @entity206 @entity9 ( right ) flung himself in the air to beat @entity2 defender @entity44 ( left ) to a cross before seeing his shot fly into the top corner the @entity212 international ( front ) celebrates his glorious strike against @entity2 in the @entity31 on saturday @entity10 doubled their lead soon after against the @entity217 courtesy of a blistering left - footed strike from midfielder @entity14 @entity69 ( left ) celebrates his stunning effort with @entity220 ( top right ) who was ineligible to play against his parent club click here to see our brilliant @entity225 analysis including the move for @entity14 's thunderbolt for @entity10 mins @entity229 @entity2 total 116.7 72.5 @entity46 90 12.6 7.8 @entity49 90 12.0 7.4 @entity42 90 11.8 7.3 @entity230 total 112.9 70.1 @entity70 90 12.4 7.7 @entity231 90 12.1 7.4 @entity14 90 11.2 7.0 data courtesy of the @entity233 , the @entity234 of the @entity31 @entity10 extended their lead in the 68th minute , courtesy of a second screamer , this one from @entity69 from 25 yards , that went in off a post			1
‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning , ’ got another rancorous airing			0
@entity6 , however , made what would prove to be a major substitution in the 69th minute , replacing @entity53 with @entity0			1
the sub scored his first goal after a fine pass from @entity47 and his second , with three minutes left of normal time remaining , after a knockdown from @entity51 , he lifted his shirt to show a message of support — for @entity130			2

‘ when you ’re 2 - 0 up , it feels like a defeat to draw , ’ he admitted			1
‘ we made terrible mistakes			0
’ he specified that goalkeeper @entity61 ’s positioning was poor for @entity0 ’s first goal			2
the @entity263 certainly left a little too much room between himself and a post as @entity0 slotted it through the gap			2
@entity82 also said one of his ‘ kids ’ got ‘ caught out ’ for the second — a reference to 20 - year - old left - back @entity65 failing to mark @entity51 properly with three minutes remaining , allowing the latter a knockdown across goal from a cross , right to the feet to @entity0 , who scored			2

instead , it ’s only been a decent one			0
’ @entity6 ’s side are no longer bottom , as they were at the start of play , if only because @entity286 and @entity287 did not play			0
