by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 does n’t need a cursory glance towards his cousin , @entity4 , to realise how quickly fortunes can change			1
the former @entity9 manager ’s @entity7 side were just six points above the @entity12 relegation zone at the beginning of february but tonight embark on a play - off semi-final against big - spending @entity15			1
it ’s been such a turnaround over the last three months that the @entity7 are 17 games unbeaten - with 13 clean sheets to boot - and go in as the form side			1
turnaround : @entity2 's @entity7 have reached the playoffs in remarkable style not bad for a man whose remit when taking over at @entity26 was to purely keep them afloat			1
just three games now stand between them and the third tier			0
‘ two weeks ago @entity4 was on top of a mountain and everything was rosy , but it ’s all changed , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ they have almost gone from winning the league to losing it			0
i ’m desperately disappointed for him			0
’ @entity2 ’s mum and @entity4 ’ grandmother were sisters ; the @entity41 manager has said that the cousin - 11 years his senior - was a major influence on his career			1
‘ we never seem to have the luxury of having a good night together , ’ @entity2 added			1
‘ the only time i see @entity4 is on coaching courses because he ’s a hell of a lot busier than i am because of @entity41 ’s size			1
family fortunes : @entity4 ( left ) looked glum after @entity41 's setbacks while @entity2 ( right ) is happy at @entity7 ‘ you lose touch			1
you ’re so focused on your own job			0
the amount of time football can take up in your life is amazing			0
i spend a lot of time at this club in @entity12			1
@entity62 only knows what @entity4 spends up there at the top of the @entity66			1
’ @entity7 ’s rise can not be understated , can not be overlooked			2
it ’s ten years this week since they played their final game in @entity71 - against @entity72 no less - before dropping down to the @entity73			2
seasons in the doldrums , serious financial woe and play - off disappointment followed until eventual promotion in 2012			1
@entity2 took over last march , kept them up and has n’t looked back			2
‘ we want to see how far we can push ourselves , ’ the 52 - year - old said			2
‘ whatever is earned by the club gets put back in			0
it ’s in black and white			0
‘ the chairman [ @entity86 ] is very committed to making sure the club is a part of the community			0
that ’s very important to the city of @entity7			2
that ’s close to his heart , and rightly so			0
’ @entity2 earned 66 caps for his country and played in a @entity96 , revealing that he turned down two opportunities at clubs higher up the pyramid before plumping for @entity7			1
he is self - aware and knows exactly what the drop from international management to @entity103 ’s basement looks like			2
perceptions do n’t bother him			0
step down : @entity2 knows the move from international management to @entity12 surprised some in the battle : @entity7 's playoff dreams mean their season is still alive ‘ if you ’re a football person and enjoy the game you should n’t feel embarrassed by it , ’ he said			1
‘ you sometimes have to bide your time			0
everybody wants to be as high as they can but it ’s got to be right for you			0
i loved my time as @entity9 manager and had some really good results in that time			2
people wanted change and you get on with it			0
‘ we were close to qualifying for tournaments			0
it ’d be huge if they ever did it because , no disrespect , they do n’t have enough players at the top level			0
‘ i ’m back out on the grass and working for good people at @entity7			2
when you add those things up , i ’m a very happy man			0
’ @entity2 will be even more gratified if he can deliver what would be an unthinkable promotion - not least to add some smiles to family faces .			1
