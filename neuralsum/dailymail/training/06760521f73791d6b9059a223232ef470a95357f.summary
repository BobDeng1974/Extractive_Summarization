by @entity0 last updated at 1:25 pm on 13th july 2011 it ’s hard to tell whether the whole thing is a complete joke or if this guy is actually serious			2
a man calling himself ' @entity6 ' , believed to be from @entity7 , claims he will allow people to hunt him for $ 10,000 and will try his best to avoid being captured			1
the unemployed 28 - year - old says he is ‘ pro-prey , looking for a change ’ and will allow people to hunt him naked for an extra $ 2,000			1
human hunting : @entity14 , of @entity7 , claims he will allow people to hunt him for $ 10,000 - or $ 12,000 naked ‘ i seek hearty gents who fancy themselves sportsmen and bored of the usual game , ’ he writes on his website @entity17			1
‘ i am a new breed of prey with thick pelt and smooth hide			2
mr @entity14 's inspiration could have come from the 1994 film @entity28 , starring @entity29 as homeless man @entity30			0
mr @entity30 , who lives on the streets , gets a job as a servant for a hunting party but soon realises that he is actually their prey			0
‘ i ’m faster than a wild turkey , smart as any god * * * n wild boar and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the monetary health of my family			0
‘ if i am trapped and killed you stand to earn the respect of your fellow hunters , a prize human mount for your wall and all income from any organ harvest			0
’ his website features pictures of him hiding behind trees or in grass and sitting in a ‘ strategic foetal position ’ , reported @entity56			0
mr @entity14 says he will be unarmed and will ‘ not attempt self - defence ’ , claiming all payment if he dies should go to his family			2
run for cover : unemployed 28 - year - old mr @entity14 says on his @entity62 page he is ' pro-prey , looking for a change ' find me : his website features pictures of him hiding behind trees or in grass and sitting in a foetal position he claims to be currently living with his parents , who are threatening to kick him out , and is desperately trying to generate some cash			1
mr @entity14 says he has previously worked in construction , fast food , landscaping and cleaning			0
‘ i seek hearty gents who fancy themselves sportsmen and bored of the usual game			0
i am a new breed of prey with thick pelt and smooth hide ' @entity14 his new line of work has received much media coverage but it is still unclear whether he will actually go through with any legitimate offers - and whether the whole thing is legal			1
but the website and huge interest may well get him what he really wants - as he told the @entity92 that he would like a job opportunity better than ‘ being shot in the face ’			2
legal experts told @entity56 the idea seems a hoax , but if it 's actually real then problems could be caused if his hunting experiences are considered as solicitation to commit murder or assisted suicide .			1

' @entity6 ' claims he is trying to generate some extra cash
*law* experts say the whole thing seems a hoax and could be illegal
but 28 - year - old *insists* he is legitimate and will go through with it
