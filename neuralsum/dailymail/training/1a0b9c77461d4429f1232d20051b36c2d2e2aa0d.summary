when @entity1 , 33 , first met her husband of three years , @entity2 , 65 , it was love at first sight			1
the fact that she was 17 and the mechanic was 48 , made no difference to her - she just felt a strong attraction despite the fact they were both already spoken for			1
in fact , the age gap between the @entity13 pair was the least complicated thing about their new connection as @entity2 was in a relationship with @entity19 , the mother of @entity21 's boyfriend			1
their relationship first began as a secret affair as he was married to @entity21 's boyfriend 's mother the couple eloped to @entity32 in 2012 , pictured here on their wedding day @entity1 said : ' age was never an issue			1
i just saw a man i really liked and possibly fancied			0
that 's all i thought about , although i did feel guilty , ' she revealed on @entity41 show @entity25 , which airs tonight			1
the couple embarked on a secret affair			2
she said : ' the first time [ we had sex ] was amazing , it rocked my world			0
i have never been loved like that before			0
' but @entity2 ( also known as @entity49 ) was worried about the age difference and ended their affair , going on to marry @entity19 - leaving @entity21 heartbroken			1

but she lost custody of them when she was imprisoned in 2010 for committing a violent act			0
during her time behind bars , @entity2 split up with @entity19 and began visiting @entity21			1

the couple were able to provide a stable home for @entity1 's two children so custody was restored			1
her eldest son , @entity89 , 15 , said he does n't mind that his new step - father ( who was once his step - grandfather ) is so much older than his mother			1
he said : ' i would rather my mum is with an older man than a younger man who does n't treat her right			0

the @entity41 show also features married couple @entity106 , 30 , and @entity107 , 70 , from south @entity114			1
thanks to their 40 - year age gap , @entity106 said they do provoke comments from people when they are seen out together			1
she said : ' people say it 's nice to go out with your dad			2
when i say it 's my husband they are shocked			2
if i give him a kiss , people will do a double take			0
' once we went to the cinema and asked for two tickets - we were given one for an @entity135 and one for a child ! ' the couple met when @entity106 was 21 and @entity107 was 61			2
@entity106 recalled : ' my initial reaction was " he 's old " but when we started talking it became irrelevant			0
i could tell this guy wanted to look after me and give me advice if i asked for it			0
' @entity106 said they do n't care what people think about their age gap relationship			1

she credits @entity107 , a natural health expert , for helping her get her life back on track			0
she said : ' i had a really tough time for five or six years			0
i almost completely lost it and the reason i have n't is @entity107			0
he 's been a complete rock			0
' she added : ' it has made a difference him being older			0
i think if i met someone younger or closer to my age they would n't have been able to comprehend what i had been through			2
@entity107 understands how life events can change you so age makes a huge difference there			0
