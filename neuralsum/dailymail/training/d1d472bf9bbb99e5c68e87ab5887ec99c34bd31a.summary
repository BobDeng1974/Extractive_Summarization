by @entity0 published : 02:49 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 20:57 est , 8 march 2013 bundle of joy : mother @entity3 with baby @entity4 who was born on the train to @entity6 last night you can just imagine the collective eye - roll when the guard announced the packed 18.18 from @entity10 was going to be delayed			1
no doubt those eyes stood out on stalks when they heard it was because a woman had gone into labour			0
fifteen minutes later , @entity3 , 22 , had given birth a baby girl on the carriage floor – to the cheers ( and perhaps a few tears ) of fellow passengers			1
miss @entity23 's waters broke on thursday afternoon but she was told by hospital staff in @entity26 to go home because her baby was ' not going to be born for a long time '			1
to get home to @entity31 in @entity32 , she boarded the commuter train to @entity34 at @entity35 , with her boyfriend @entity36 , 21 , and his mother @entity37			1
but less than five minutes later , as the train approached @entity39 , miss @entity3 turned to them and said : ' i 've just felt a contraction and i 'm going into labour			1
' the family feared the worst because @entity23 had a traumatic birth when she had her first child four years ago			0
luckily , an off - duty midwife , off - duty police officer and a nurse happened to be on board and sprang into action as the train came to a halt			1
the policeman ushered passengers into another carriage as the midwife , nurse and mrs @entity59 helped miss @entity60 on to the floor – while @entity63 train guard @entity62 kept the passengers informed of progress			1
@entity59 was delivered within 15 minutes , weighing 6lbs 13oz			0
and remarkably , the train was delayed for just 37 minutes			2
mother and daughter were taken to hospital but were released yesterday			1
@entity4 's hospital band which says where and when she was born happy family : father @entity36 spoke of his amazement that his daughter was born on board a train miss @entity3 said : ' i was petrified			1
one minute i was sitting in the seat talking to my mum on the phone , the next i started contractions and then it all happened so quickly			2
' i just thought " i do n't want to give birth on a train – it 's not very dignified "			1
' when @entity4 arrived i was shell - shocked			2
it 's still sinking in			0
she was a week early so we were n't really expecting her			2
delight : grandmother @entity90 , right , told how the couple had been on their way back from hospital when @entity3 suddenly went into labour ' overwhelmed ' : father @entity36 described the birth of his daughter on the train as ' surreal ' ' apparently everyone was cheering us when we were taken off the train to an ambulance but like any new mum all i could concentrate on was my baby			1
' mr @entity36 , a chef , said : ' i ca n't believe my daughter was born on a train			1
it still seems so surreal			0
i was so worried when we knew the baby was coming			2
' but to be there when she was born was just amazing			0
we 're just so grateful to everyone who helped			0
' scene : a train pulls into @entity114 today , where @entity4 was born last night drama : passengers waited here on the train and on the platform as @entity4 came into the world , and clapped and cheered as they were taken to hospital @entity121 mrs @entity59 , 40 , said : ' i want to say a really big thank you to all the passengers who were so patient			1
' none of the passengers in our carriage complained when they were asked to move to another carriage or get off the train			0
they were all so nice and concerned			0
i think they just wanted to make sure there was a happy outcome			0
' when the driver announced the baby had been born everyone was clapping and cheering , it was so lovely			2
i had tears in my eyes			0
' new commuter : @entity4 was born on the 18:18 @entity10 to @entity143 @entity63 service last night mr @entity62 said : ' we had everyone we needed right there on the train			1
we were only missing a vicar to baptise the baby ! ' in all my 41 years working on the railway i 've never experienced anything like this			0
' many passengers took to @entity155 to detail their unusual train journey home			0
one wrote : ' @entity158			0
woman on my train just gave birth to a daughter			2
@entity165 to hear train driver making such lovely announcements			0
' @entity63 announced that the carriage would be named after @entity4 .			2
