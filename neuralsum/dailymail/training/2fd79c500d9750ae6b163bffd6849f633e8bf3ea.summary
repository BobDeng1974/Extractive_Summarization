deep within our city sewers , a new breed of genetically mutated ‘ super rats ’ , immune to poison , are spreading at alarming speeds			2
scientists have now begun charting their rapid invasion into new communities by monitoring their progress in 17 counties in the @entity11			1
genetic testing by @entity13 has revealed that the rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons			1
this giant vermin was reportedly found in @entity24 , @entity25 in counties such as @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity25 , all the rats tested were found to have immunity to poison			1
places such as @entity36 and @entity37 had slightly less resilient rats with immunity levels at 33 per cent , and 50 per cent respectively			2
around 30 per cent of rats in @entity41 are immune to poison , in @entity44 it is 40 per cent , while 75 per cent of rats in @entity46 are immune			2

a swarm of ' super rats ' spotted across the country is expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year while the rats have been changing , humans have been using the same anticoagulant poisons since the 1950s			1
research earlier this year found that the swarm of ' super rats ' spotted across the country is expected to outnumber humans two - to - one by next year			1
for the very first time , the @entity63 programme , which airs at 7.30pm bst on @entity64 , will show footage and images of these tested ‘ super rats ’			1
‘ i think people should be concerned about these resistant rats because of public health concerns - because they carry disease and various other bacteria and viruses , ’ said researchers dr @entity69			1
‘ they also damage buildings … they cost billions of pounds of damage worldwide			0
’ ‘ with the use of rodenticides , that will kill off the normal rats , and then the resistant ones will remain			1
‘ so it ’s a sort of time bomb of resistance building up over generations of rats			0
’ ‘ the fact we 've tested 17 counties and every single one of them has got resistant rats was an amazing find to us			1
we did n't expect to have every single county having resistant rats			1
’ while the rats have been changing , humans have been using the same anticoagulant poisons since the 1950s			1
this photo shows a huge rat that was caught in @entity103 earlier this year			1
it measured 50cm from tail to nose dr @entity69 claims communities across the country are running out of defences as the government contemplates the future of rodenticide use			0
the most potent rat poisons are currently for professional use only and can not be used outside without special license			1
the decision about the future regulation of rodent poison – mainly because of secondary poisoning to @entity121 and other animals - is expected this autumn			0
dr @entity69 explained how the costs of pest control will escalate as a result of these poison - tolerant rats			0
‘ unless there 's new legislation for the more toxic poisons and maybe for the more lax use of them , then it will have to be the more physical forms of killing the rats , ’ he said			1
‘ the costs are going to escalate because of the monitoring and the picking off of the rats , and the dead bodies			0
’ @entity140 , owned by @entity142 resident @entity141 , caught one of the large rats whose numbers are increasing around the country			0
and the problem is not just confined to @entity11			2
other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in @entity150 and @entity151 scientists have now begun charting their rapid invasion into new communities by monitoring their progress in 17 counties in the @entity11			1
pictured are the counties in which all the rats tested were immune to poison figures have revealed that , in some regions of the @entity11 , the number of vermin has already surged by 50 per cent since april last year			1
and experts believe the rat population could soar from 80 million to 160 million by the end of the year			2
in april , a 2ft ( 0.6 metres ) long rat was captured in @entity103 while other monster rats have been reported in @entity25 and in @entity49			2
rats thrive in damp and soggy weather - of which the @entity11 has seen plenty during the wettest year on record			1
vermin are also swapping rural areas for the big city			0
they can carry illnesses which can be passed to humans , including @entity179 ’s disease , which has flu - like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice and kidney failure			0
across the country , councils have reported a rise in the number of rats being reported			0
@entity188 has the highest number of call - outs with 5,100 in the past year			0
and the problem is not just confined to @entity11			2
other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in @entity150 and @entity151 , where one rat was trapped by pest control after terrorising an @entity197 family in south @entity151			0
the @entity151 - based ' monster vermin ' had been terrorising @entity200 and @entity201 ’ home in @entity202 shortly after they moved into their new flat			0
giant rats , the size of cows or even bigger , could one day fill a ‘ significant chunk ’ of @entity209 ’s emptying ecospace			2
the terrifying scenario could become a reality as super-adaptable rats take advantage of larger mammals becoming extinct , an expert predicts			0
‘ animals will evolve , over time , into whatever designs will enable them to survive and to produce offspring , ’ said geologist dr @entity216 , from the @entity217			0
for instance , in the @entity223 , when the dinosaurs lived , there were mammals , but these were very small , rat and mouse - sized , because dinosaurs occupied the larger ecological @entity228 once the dinosaurs were out of the way did these tiny mammals evolve into many different forms			0
‘ given enough time , rats could probably grow to be at least as large as the capybara , the world ’s largest rodent , that lives today , that can reach 80 kilos ( 17lb )			0
‘ if the ecospace was sufficiently empty , then they could get larger still			0

humans have been using the same rat poisons since the 1950s
but rats have developed a mutation that allows them to survive poisons
out of 17 @entity11 counties tested , every single one of them had resistant rats
reports this year *suggest* that rats in the @entity11 are also becoming bigger
' @entity255 rats ' are expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year
footage of the rats will be shown on the @entity63 programme , on @entity64 at 7.30pm bst
