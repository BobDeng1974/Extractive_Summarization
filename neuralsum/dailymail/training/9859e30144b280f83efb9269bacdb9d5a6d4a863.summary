by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 03:57 est , 14 december 2012 assortment of cheeses : a new study shows the art of cheese making dates back at least 7,000 years to @entity6 the art of cheese - making dates back at least 7,000 years , archaeologists have concluded after finding traces of an ancient vintage			1
chemical analysis of fragments of pottery believed to have been specially designed for creating cheese has shown that it was being made in about @entity16			2
but far from coming from regions like @entity19 in @entity20 and @entity21 in @entity22 that are famous today for their cheeses , the earliest vintage comes from the @entity26 region of @entity27			1
by analysing fatty acids extracted from unglazed pottery pierced with small holes excavated from archaeological sites in the area , the researchers showed that dairy products were processed in these ceramic vessels			1
and the nature of the sieves , close in shape to modern cheese - strainers , provides compelling evidence that these specialised vessels have been used for cheese - making			2
before the study , milk residues had been detected in early sites in north - western @entity46 ( 8,000 years ago ) and in @entity47 ( nearly 7,000 years ago )			0
however , it had been impossible to detect if the milk was processed to cheese products			0
researchers from the @entity52 at the @entity53 , together with colleagues from the @entity55 and @entity6 studied unglazed pottery from the region of @entity27 dating from around 7,000 years ago			1
researchers examined preserved fatty acids trapped in the fabric of the pottery and showed that the sieves had indeed been used for processing dairy products			1
milk residues were also detected in non-perforated bowls , which may have been used with the sieves			0
the pit where the cheese traces were found : far from coming from regions like @entity19 in @entity20 and @entity21 in @entity22 that are famous today for their cheeses , the earliest vintage comes from the @entity26 region of @entity27 the processing of milk and particularly the production of cheese were critical in early agricultural societies as it allowed the preservation of milk in a non-perishable and transportable form and it made milk a more digestible commodity for early prehistoric farmers			1
@entity85 , a phd student from the @entity53 and one of the authors of the paper , said : ' before this study , it was not clear that cattle were used for their milk in @entity93 around 7,000 years ago			0
' however , the presence of the sieves in the ceramic assemblage of the sites was thought to be a proof that milk and even cheese was produced at these sites			0
' of course , these sieves could have been used for straining all sorts of things , such as curds from whey , meat from stock or honeycombs from honey			0
detective work : by analysing fatty acids extracted from unglazed pottery pierced with small holes found there , the researchers showed that dairy products were processed in these ceramic vessels ' we decided to test the cheese - making hypothesis by analysing the lipids trapped into the ceramic fabric of the sieves			1
' the presence of milk residues in sieves ( which look like modern cheese - strainers ) constitutes the earliest direct evidence for cheese - making			2
' the leader of the @entity132 team , professor @entity133 , added : ' it is truly remarkable the depth of insights into ancient human diet and food processing technologies these ancient fats preserved in archaeological ceramics are now providing us with			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity144 .			0
