for the 55,000 brave aircrew who lost their lives in the @entity4 , it would have been their final view of @entity6 , soaring high above the @entity8 countryside			1
in tribute , one of the world 's last two airworthy @entity10 takes the same route over @entity14 - where some 389,000 sorties were flown by @entity16 between 1939 and 1945			1
this moving footage is captured from a light aircraft flying alongside the 69ft - long @entity20 bomber , flying in formation much how the legendary bombers would have done more than 70 years ago			1
the four - minute tribute video shows the bomber taking off from @entity37 , flying down to @entity38 , then out towards the @entity39 and over @entity41 - home of the @entity42			1
the @entity20 @entity27 , with a magnificent 102ft wingspan , looks haunting and glorious , its distinctive markings shimmering in the sunlight , as the plane - one of the @entity4 's most - recognisable @entity34 aircraft - powers across the blue sky			1
at one point , the two planes are so close to each other , the passengers in the light aircraft flying alongside are able to see the @entity27 pilot 's face - and the dials on its dashboard			1
@entity58 , 36 , from @entity59 , who shot the video for @entity30 , said : ' it was spectacular - the sun was shining on the @entity27 and it looked as awesome as you would expect			1
it was a fantastic sight			0
incredible machine : the @entity20 @entity27 as it flies above @entity34 , having made the journey across the @entity67 for the final time flying high : the spectacular footage captures the @entity27 gliding just metres away from @entity70 ' @entity28 ' it was staggering just how close we were able to get			1
we were able to see right inside the cockpit - at times , you could see the pilot , and some of the dials on the dashboard			0
we were just metres away from each other			0
' the noise was incredible as well - when you 're on the ground , it 's a unique sound and very different to modern aircraft			2
if you were living in the flight path to one of those , you would know about it			0
' it 's a very low but loud drone - very basey			2
you can just imagine that noise during the war - and the @entity27 being a very threatening device			2
' as one of the world 's only two remaining @entity27 bombers , to have the opportunity to see the plane that was so vital during the @entity4 , the most significant aircraft helping the allies to win , to see one of these up close , the famous @entity99 plane , it was a really special moment			1
' flight of a lifetime : the @entity20 @entity27 bomber flies above the @entity34 as @entity30 films footage from a light aircraft soaring just feet away journey of a lifetime : the @entity20 @entity27 made the flight to @entity34 for the final time to fly with the only other airworthy bomber in the world @entity58 shot the footage of the incredible @entity20 @entity27 bomber - flying just metres away in a twin - engine @entity28 more than 7,377 @entity10 , 430 of which were built in @entity20 , were built during the @entity4 but many that survived were scrapped			1
it was the most successful bomber used by the @entity116 and the @entity117			2
in 1940 , @entity34 prime minister @entity118 threw his support behind the @entity116 's @entity120 and the development of @entity16 , stating : ' the @entity122 can lose us the war , but only the @entity116 can win it			1
therefore our supreme effort must be to gain overwhelming mastery in the air			0
' the @entity128 are our salvation , but the @entity130 alone provide the means of victory			0
' the @entity133 - dedicated to @entity134 , the last @entity20 airman to be awarded the @entity135 in @entity4 – made the long journey to @entity34 from its base at the @entity139 's @entity138 earlier this month			1
it has joined the @entity140 at various events over the past few weeks - marking the first time the two @entity130 have flown together in 50 years			0
the two aircraft are expected to visit some 60 air shows and public events across the @entity34 over the next five weeks			1
they took to the skies over @entity148 last week - joined by jet planes from the @entity150			0

the price includes a 40 - minute flight - flying alongside the @entity27 for about 30 minutes - as well as a tour of the plane and a photo opportunity			1
@entity185 , ceo of @entity70 , said : ‘ we offer these flights to ensure the memory of those aircrews who gave of themselves in our hour of need , is never forgotten			2
‘ we can appreciate and enjoy the aircraft that are kept in museums , but it is only when they are fired up and flying that these legendary machines capture the attention and imagination of all			2
the light aircraft flew alongside the @entity27 bomber , at times so close that passengers could see the pilot and the dials in the cockpit people take photos of the @entity27 bomber , one of only two in the world still flying , at @entity213 in @entity214 , as it tours the country the bombers are equipped with four @entity218 engines , which are capable of pushing the planes up to 275mph the @entity27 from @entity220 which flew with the @entity20 bomber in formation for a public display on may 16 , 1943 , 19 aircraft set out to destroy three dams in the @entity226 - the @entity227 , the @entity228 and the @entity229			1

the strategic targets not only supplied hydro - electric power , and water for steel - making , but also supplied drinking water			0
the squadron was assembled by wing commander @entity241 with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission - using special bouncing bombs , invented by @entity243			0
they were not told that they would be bombing the @entity226 until six hours before the raid began , following weeks of practice over @entity248 reservoirs			0
on the night of the mission - codenamed @entity250 - the 113 crewmen took off in three waves along two different routes to bomb the dams			0
@entity241 attacked first at the @entity227 at 12.28am , but five bombs were dropped before it was breached			0
the first wave ’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the @entity228 which finally collapsed at 1.52am			2
aircraft from the other two waves bombed the @entity229 but it remained intact			0
although the mission was hailed a success , eight aircraft and 53 crew were lost during the raids			0
‘ and if the story of the heroism of those people is to be passed on to future generations , it will be through the regular flying of these aircraft - their sight and sound will inspire future generations			2
’ the @entity27 is one of the @entity4 's most - recognisable @entity34 aircraft			1
it is most famous for the @entity152 raids , which saw 19 @entity10 attack @entity234 dams with sir @entity243 's ' bouncing bombs ' in 1943			0
