by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 03:41 est , 12 april 2012 @entity1 posing during the 38th @entity3 film festival , where he presented @entity4 : strong ' macho ' men tend to hold right - wing views - and in particular support military action if you have ever seen a film starring @entity1 or @entity12 it will come as no surprise			1
male action film stars are more likely to have right - wing political views than other actors , a study has found			1
on questions of foreign policy in particular , if the actor carries a gun on screen he is more likely to back the troops in real life			2
the researchers concluded that macho men were more likely to believe in the ‘ utility of political aggression ’ to solve conflict			1
they are unlike most of @entity31 which is traditionally left wing , including the dozens of actors who came out against the wars in @entity37 and @entity38			1
the study by @entity40 from @entity41 in @entity42 examined how the ability to fight still plays an important role in shaping men ’s behaviour and outlook , even though we have long moved on from being @entity50 hunter gatherers			1
@entity40 concluded that if a man has a strong upper body he is more likely to become aggressive when angered , he will became angry more quickly and tends to feel more entitled to things			2
but he also discovered that macho men were more likely to be right wing too in a surprising additional finding			1
his theory does indeed appear to be born out by the careers of @entity1 and @entity12			2
whilst governor of @entity59 implemented stringent budget cuts in line with @entity63 doctrine			0
he has also made a number of visits to @entity37 to show his support for @entity68 troops and has spent time with @entity68 soldiers in @entity38			0
‘ @entity71 ’ star @entity12 supported @entity72 , @entity73 and appeared at the 2000 @entity74 in the @entity68			0
die - hard right winger ? @entity12 supported @entity72 , @entity73 and appeared at the 2000 @entity74 in the @entity68			0
others who have proclaimed their support for the @entity63 in the @entity68 include @entity79 star @entity78 , veteran action film actor @entity80			2
the study authors conclude : ‘ @entity87 body strength in adult males is a crucial variable that appears to have impacts on a wide range of mental mechanisms			0
‘ these mechanisms were designed by natural selection at a time when personal physical aggression was far more common and individual differences in fighting ability were far more relevant for the resolution of conflicts			0
‘ despite the steady decline in physical aggression and violent deaths that have accompanied @entity102 civilization , the human mind is still designed for ancestral environments			0

physically strong men tend to hold right wing views
' @entity108 of army in particular
action stars tend to be right wing , while other @entity31 stars swing left
