' but the saucepan i was working with was a cheap one and the bottom had all scratched away and some of the inside metal was getting thinner and thinner			2
' i was caramelising the mixture into a paste and i 'd pulled it off the hob slightly , but there was one edge that was still on and that got red hot			2
' when i went to put it back on the hob and stir it one last time , the bottom fell off the saucepan and the mixture hit the hob			1
' that 's when it went bang			0
it lit instantly and blew up in my face			0
' most of the flames were sucked up by the extractor fan , but they also engulfed my body as i did not have a shirt on			0
' my mum screamed and i just dropped to the floor and rolled around to put out the flames			0
