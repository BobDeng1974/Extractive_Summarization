by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 02:44 est , 23 august 2013 the instant camera is set to make a comeback			1
@entity4 camera maker @entity3 has unveiled a new camera that prints card - sized photos instantly			1
each time a photo is taken , the printout appears from the top of the camera and , like the infamous @entity11 version , will develop and dry as it hits the air			1
@entity4 camera maker @entity3 has unveiled its @entity14 , pictured , that prints card - sized photos instantly			1
official pricing information for the @entity16 has n't been released but it is expected to cost around £ 135 with a 10 - shot film roll priced at around £ 4.50 the @entity18 can shoot multiple exposures and has shutter speeds up to 1/400 of a second meaning it can be used in a range of lighting conditions			1
@entity3 announced the camera during an event in @entity27 and it will go on sale in @entity4 on 23 august before being released globally on september 20			1
it will cost ¥ 20,000 in @entity4 , which converts to around £ 134 , yet official @entity16 prices have not yet been released			1
a 10 - shot roll of film will cost around ¥ 700 , which would be around £ 4.55			1
@entity3 was the first company to produce film in 1934 and began selling instant cameras during the 1980s with its f series , including the @entity34 and @entity35			2
the technology was first sold commercially by @entity38 scientist @entity37 , who co-founded the @entity11 corporation			0
speaking at the event in @entity27 , general manager @entity3 's photo imaging products division , @entity42 told the @entity43 : ' people crave something real , a physical object that is unique and that you can hold in your hand			2
the camera , pictured being held by users at an event in @entity27 , can shoot multiple exposures and has shutter speeds up to 1/400 of a second meaning it can be used in a range of lighting conditions ' film yields an authenticity that is often missing in a digital world			1
' photographer @entity61 added that the technology makes people think more about the photos they 're taking and ultimately makes them better photographers			0
@entity3 is hoping the release will restore sales of its instant camera range , which had fallen by 90 per cent in 2002			1
instant camera film has the developing process arranged in chemical layers onto each sheet of film			2
a chemical reagent made sits in a layer just above the light - sensitive layers of the film , but below the image layer			2
before the picture is taken , the reagent is collected at the border of the sheet of film			0
when the pictures is taken , the film is rolled out of the camera and the reagent is spread into the middle of the sheet and pushed between the layers of the film			2
it then moves downward through the laye ­ rs , changing the exposed particles in each layer into metallic silver			0
the chemicals dissolve the developer dye so it begins to move up towards the image layer			0
the metallic silver areas at each layer stick to the dyes and stops them from moving further			0
this means only the dyes and colours needed to make the picture move through the layers to where they are needed			0
the colours then mix to create a translucent green film on the surface of the image			0
light reflects off the white pigment in the reagent and shines through the colour layers			0
the timing layer slows the reagent down on its path to the acid layer , to give the film time to develop before it is exposed to light			0
the stage where the image develops is the final chemical reaction in which an acid layer clears up the opacifiers in the reagent so the image is visible			0

the @entity14 mini 90 @entity18 prints photos from the top of the camera
is *due* to go on sale globally from 20 september at around £ 135
it will hold a roll of 10 - shot roll of film that is set to cost around £ 4.50
