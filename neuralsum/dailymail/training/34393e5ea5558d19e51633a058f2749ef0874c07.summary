by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 05:46 est , 13 september 2013 a father - of - two with a rare cancer gene had his stomach removed despite being given the all - clear by doctors - and found he was in the early stages of the disease			1
@entity8 , 33 , decided to have the procedure to make sure he would live to see his young daughters grow up			1
doctors found he had the mutant @entity13 gene which meant he had an 80 per chance of developing the aggressive stomach cancer that claimed the lives of two of his cousins			1
@entity8 ( pictured with his wife , @entity20 ) has a rare gene which meant he had an 80 per cent chance of developing stomach cancer			1
he had his stomach removed to ensure he would live to see his daughters grow up they told mr @entity8 he had not yet developed the disease but he still underwent the major six - hour operation to remove his stomach			1
medics then discovered he had been in the early stages of the disease after all and that the procedure had saved his life			1
mr @entity8 , of @entity32 , who inherited the gene from his father ’s side of the family , said : ‘ i have two adorable children and want to see them grow up			2
‘ the survival rates of stomach cancer are absolutely dire so it was n’t a difficult decision to make			1
‘ to go ahead with an operation of that magnitude is a personal choice			0
one of the great things is the risk has gone and is never coming back			0
‘ i ’m so glad i did it because i did have the early stages of stomach cancer			1
mr @entity8 ( pictured with his wife , @entity20 , and daughters @entity50 , five , and @entity51 , two ) had tests which suggested that he did not have the cancer but he decided to have his stomach removed anyway ‘ i ’d had an endoscopy and biopsies at the end of 2011 which came back clear for stomach cancer , but the risk was still there			1
‘ we were told endoscopies can be unreliable and biopsies can miss cancer by millimetres so i decided to take the drastic decision to have my stomach removed			1
‘ people say i ’m really unlucky to have that gene but i feel incredibly fortunate i found out about it and had this treatment before i had to go through something much worse			0
after the operation , mr @entity8 discovered that he did actually have early stage stomach cancer so the surgery saved his life			1
he says he is relieved that the risk is gone ‘ rather than a negative thing , i think it ’s quite a positive			0
’ mr @entity8 and his wife @entity20 , who run a web design company , now face an anxious wait to see if their daughters @entity50 , five , and @entity51 , two , have also inherited the cancer gene			1
the youngsters will have to wait until their early teens until they can be tested for the gene which they have a 50 per cent chance of carrying			2
mr @entity8 said : ‘ we have the stress that one day our kids may go through something like this but that ’s a long way off			2
mr @entity8 can not store food now that he does not have a stomach so he has to eat a high - calorie diet and has lots of small meals every day ‘ the way medicine is progressing it could be something which is resolved without an operation			1
’ mr @entity8 made a speedy recovery after the operation and less than two weeks later was enjoying a couple of pints in his local			2
after six weeks he was back at work			0
the operation was possible as the stomach is mainly used for food storage and is not essential for digestion			2
as part of the procedure the bottom of mr @entity8 ’s oesophagus was connected to the top of his intestines			2
mr @entity8 , who runs a web design company with his wife , says that he was amazed by how quickly he recovered after the operation this has reduced his capacity for food and means he needs to eat little and often , with lots of high calorie meals			1
he said : ‘ it ’s not a different as you might think			0
i enjoy a diet most people would be jealous of and have a lot of biscuits and crisps at my desk			0
‘ i am always pretty optimistic but by my standards the recovery was quicker and easier than i thought and i feel better than i ever thought i would again			0
’ the @entity13 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps cells stick to one another			0
the proteins bind cells together so that they form organised tissues			0
the gene is also thought to act as a tumour suppressor , preventing cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way to form a cancerous tumour			0
because this protein helps cells stick together , it may stop cancer cells detaching from a tumour and travelling through the bloodstream to other parts of the body			0
more than 50 mutations of the gene have been found in people with an inherited cancer syndrome called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer			0
this disorder greatly increases the risk of a person developing cancer of the stomach lining			2
in these people , the cancer most commonly develops when they are in their 30s or 40s .			0

@entity8 , 33 , had an 80 *%* chance of developing stomach cancer
aggressive disease *killed* two of his cousins so he had tests to see if he had it - were negative but he decided to have his stomach removed anyway
after op , medics discovered he actually already had early signs of disease
without a stomach he ca *n't* store food so has to eat a high - calorie diet and have lots of small meals
