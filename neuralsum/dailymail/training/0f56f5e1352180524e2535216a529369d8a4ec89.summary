by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 20:11 est , 12 june 2013 a daughter has been ordered today to repay at least £ 290,000 into her dead mother 's estate after a top judge ruled that she had unintentionally exerted ‘ undue influence ’ over the widow			1
@entity7 , 47 , was locked in a bitter legal war with her brothers and other family members over cash and property transfers made to her from her mother @entity13 in the year before she died			1
in an acrimonious and enormously costly @entity18 struggle , her brothers , @entity15 and @entity16 , accused @entity19 of taking control of their ' vulnerable ' 86 - year - old mother ’s finances in the months before her death in 2008			2
legal battle : @entity7 ( right ) has been ordered to pay back hundreds of thousands of pounds into her dead mother 's estate after a legal battle with brothers @entity28 ( left ) and @entity16 however she said she bore the burden of looking after mrs @entity13 and that her brother @entity15 stopped visiting her and did not send flowers on @entity32			1
judge sir @entity33 today acquitted @entity19 of any conscious wrong - doing , but said that her ' relationship of influence ' over mother cast doubt on whether the pensioner ’s generosity came from her own free will			1
in a ruling which represents a financial catastrophe for @entity7 and her husband @entity44 , the judge expressed ‘ real concern ’ that @entity13 had not ‘ really understood ’ the many letters she signed shortly before her death			1
he said that @entity13 ’s gifts to her daughter ‘ called for an explanation ’ and that @entity7 had failed to convince him that her mother appreciated exactly what she was doing and was acting ‘ fully independently ’			1
although @entity7 paid £ 410,000 into mrs @entity13 's estate before the case hit court , the ruling means she must pay back the balance of what her mother gave her , at least £ 290,000			1
the judge ruled that her brothers and her mother ’s other heirs should be in the same position they would have been in had the gifts never been made			2
during the eight - day case , mrs @entity7 had vehemently denied she was out to get as much of the estate as she could and insisted she only ever had her mother ’s best interests at heart			2
she said of her brothers : ' we did n’t get on			0
i did n’t like the way they treated mum			0
it upset mum and i was incredibly protective of mum			0
the only thing i was protective of was my mother			0
family feud : judge sir @entity33 today acquitted mrs @entity7 at the @entity18 ( pictured ) of any conscious wrongdoing but said he was not convinced her mother made the gifts of her own free will ' my aim where mum was concerned was to make sure that , in her last few years of life , she was happy ; that she was n’t left on her own			1
' it was for me to look after mum and make sure she was ok			0
' the court heard mrs @entity13 , who lived in @entity94 , @entity95 , until the final year of her life , inherited the £ 1million - plus estate when her husband @entity98 , who had a successful marquee business , died in 2005			1
@entity100 , 67 , of @entity95 , claimed that , by 2007 , his mother was increasingly under the influence of his sister and denied that he had in any way neglected his filial duties			0
he said he had been working long hours and had done his best to keep in touch when she moved house during her final year			0
he previously said in court that his mother was a ' good woman and housewife ' but claimed she ' could not make up her mind about anything ' - even when it came to choosing her own curtains			0
claims : mrs @entity7 said her brother @entity15 did n't send flowers on @entity32 and she had no idea about financial matters , he told the court			0
tension was already building within the family after @entity13 announced the previous year that she was transferring part of the company 's business premises to @entity7 , the court heard			2
the brothers ' lawyers say that , by the time of @entity13 's death , nearly everything her husband had left her - valued at over £ 1million - had been transferred to @entity7 and her husband @entity44 , subject to an ' unsigned loan agreement ' that the couple would pay back £ 410,000 into her estate			1
mrs @entity7 's barrister , @entity136 , suggested that @entity28 had succeeded in ' alienating ' his mother , who had become increasingly ' angry and bitter ' at his apparent indifference			2
ruling on the case today , sir @entity33 said all the witnesses in the case had tried to speak honestly about events as they saw them and that there had been no conscious wrong - doing in mrs @entity7 ’s dealings with her mother			0
however , he concluded : ' i am left at the end of the day with a real concern as to whether @entity13 really understood the many letters that went out under her signature			0
' even if , contrary to the evidence , @entity13 did fully understand what she was doing and fully intended to act as she did , the question remains , was what she did the result of the exercise of an independent will ? ' emphasising the relationship of trust and reliance between mother and daughter , he concluded : ' at the end of the day it is for @entity7 to persuade me that her mother was acting fully independently of this undue influence			1
i am not persuaded that she was			0

judge acquitted @entity7 , of @entity95 , of any conscious wrongdoing
not convinced gifts from @entity13 were made of her independent free will
follows legal battle with brothers @entity28 and @entity16 over £ 1m estate
