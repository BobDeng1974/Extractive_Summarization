worth the wait : firefighters cheered @entity5 up after her ordeal by giving her a ride in a fire engine ' she was completely lodged and there was no way of getting her out			1
' we had a look at the mechanics and it was one solid piece - there was no way of unscrewing @entity60 had to call the fire brigade			2
