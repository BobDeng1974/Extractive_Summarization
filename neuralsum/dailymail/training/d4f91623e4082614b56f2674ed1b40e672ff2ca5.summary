@entity0 is regarded as one of the best players on the planet at present , but the @entity5 star showed even he is prone to schoolboy errors on the football field			2
@entity0 , who signed for the @entity9 giants for Â£ 63million following some stellar performances for his country at the @entity12 , was knocking the ball around at training with his @entity17 team - mates @entity15 and @entity18 before the midfielder showcased a poor first touch			1
the @entity5 was then subjected to an merciless ribbing from @entity15 , @entity18 and co for his awful control			0
@entity0 ( right ) reacts after he fails to control a pass in training @entity0 's blunder amuses @entity15 ( left ) and @entity18 greatly @entity15 and the rest of his @entity17 team - mates make fun of the @entity5 after his rare blunder @entity0 took it all in his stride			1
certainly , his team - mates appeared shocked that the midfielder was capable of misplacing a pass			0
@entity17 will put the joking aside for the rest of the week as they gear up for saturday 's @entity36 against @entity37 in @entity38			2
@entity0 's passing blunders are a rarity as the midfielder has shone for @entity17 this season			0

@entity0 misplaces pass during @entity17
