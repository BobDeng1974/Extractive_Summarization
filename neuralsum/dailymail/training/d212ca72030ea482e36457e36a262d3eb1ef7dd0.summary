a spokesman for the @entity24 said : ‘ we take all allegations of illegal working seriously and will take action where we find it			2
’ the scandal surrounding @entity5 broke on december 11 when it was shut by inspectors who found 26 elderly and vulnerable residents living in appalling conditions			1
they were moved by ambulance , still in their pyjamas , on a bitterly cold night			2
the 85 - year - old man was taken to a nearby nursing home but died within 48 hours			1
as the @entity42 reported yesterday , his death has been cloaked in official secrecy , with the @entity6 coroner , the registration officer , police , the county council and the local @entity48 trust all refusing even to release the man ’s name			1
@entity51 register office said it could not name the pensioner because of data protection rules – even though these do not apply to the dead			0
yesterday @entity57 sources signalled that ministers are unhappy with this failure to comply with the principle that deaths must be publicly recorded			0
@entity5 ( pictured ) was shut by inspectors earlier this month after they found 26 elderly and vulnerable residents living in appalling conditions one said : ‘ there is never any issue about releasing the names of people who die in tragic circumstances			1
so this case looks like using data protection for purposes that were never intended			0
common sense should be applied			0
the sense of secrecy will just make a sad and distressing situation worse			0
’ while the secrecy row continued yesterday , the involvement of @entity2 officials at @entity5 was disclosed by one of the three councils who used the care home and whose social workers have been dealing with the aftermath of the sudden shutdown			1
@entity88 council , which was paying £ 500 a week for each of its six residents , said it was co-operating with the @entity2 , police and the @entity92 in an inquiry which features ‘ significant interest ’ in the way @entity5 was run			2
a council spokesman added : ‘ we do n’t believe this is the end of the matter			0
’ the closure of @entity5 came after @entity92 inspectors found an ‘ overpowering ’ smell of urine , patients forced to wash in cold water and a broken lift which effectively imprisoned some on the top floor of the building			2
they were also concerned that the home was employing untrained staff			2
some had neither passed police checks nor received relevant training and were working up to 60 hours a week			0
@entity88 council said it had raised concerns about two other homes in the borough operated by the owners of @entity5 : @entity118 and @entity119			0
@entity118 has also since been closed while @entity119 – a residential home rather than a nursing home – remains open under the supervision of the @entity92 and social workers			0
all three homes were run by @entity20 businessman @entity19 , 51 , and his wife @entity21 , 42			0
the couple , who live in a £ 2million house in @entity128 , are thought to have been earning £ 650,000 a year from each			0
@entity130 said officers are working with a @entity92 board which is considering the @entity5 affair but there is no separate police investigation .			2
