by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 21:20 est , 31 october 2013 illegal immigrants use £ 3.7billion worth of taxpayer - funded health and education services every year , figures out yesterday suggest			1
each one taking advantage of @entity8 ’s free @entity7 and schools costs the @entity10 £ 4,250 per year , a @entity5 report reveals			1
the figures underline the true cost of illegal immigration to taxpayers and emerged as ministers admitted their controversial ‘ go home ’ vans led to just 11 illegals volunteering to leave the country			1
essential , but costly , services : each illegal immigrant taking advantage of @entity8 ¿ s free @entity7 and schools costs the @entity10 £ 4,250 per year , a @entity5 report published yesterday reveals			1
( @entity26 picture ) the @entity8 ’s huge bill for funding education and health for illegal immigrants was condemned by campaigners last night and prompted calls for further action to deal with the scale of illegal immigration			1
sir @entity36 , chairman of the @entity37 think tank said : ‘ this is a stunning figure which previous governments have covered up for far too long			0
‘ it amounts to six times the cost to the taxpayer of the entire immigration system			0
so the case for a firm crackdown on illegals is absolutely undeniable			0
’ latest figures suggest the illegal population living in the @entity8 may be as high as 863,000			1
when combined with the per person cost of around £ 4,000 estimated by the @entity5 , the statistics suggest an annual public services cost of £ 3.67billion – nearly half the annual police budget for @entity54 and @entity55			1
the controversial advertising vans were used over several days this summer in @entity58 boroughs where high numbers of illegal immigrants are thought to live			2
they carried the slogan ‘ go home or face arrest ’ and gave a hotline telephone number to call			0
home secretary @entity66 has already said the vans were ‘ too much of a blunt instrument ’ and their use will not be extended across the country			0
only 11 illegals contacted the @entity5 as a result of seeing the vans and have been removed			1
controversial : adverts urging illegal immigrants to go home were driven around @entity58 on vans , but they have only resulted in a total of 11 migrants leaving the country , according to the @entity5 's own figures however , the measure was just part of a wider campaign costing nearly £ 10,000 , featuring adverts in foreign language newspapers and postcards left in shop windows			1
overall , it helped lead to another 60 voluntary departures and another 65 are waiting in the system			0
ministers claim the 60 who have left so far have saved taxpayers nearly £ 900,000 , as voluntary departure costs as little as £ 1,000 – compared to the £ 15,000 cost of ejecting an illegal immigrant			1
although confined to @entity58 , the pilot scheme also resulted in applications to leave from as far away as @entity101 and @entity102			0
the first person to leave as a result of the campaign was a @entity106 student who saw coverage of the vans in the @entity110 newspaper			0
the report showed two thirds of the text messages sent to the hotline were hoaxes , and required 17 hours of staff time to deal with			0
campsite : @entity119 gipsies in @entity58 's @entity120 in july			0
a new report suggests there are now 200,000 @entity119 migrants living in the @entity8 @entity8 has one of the largest @entity119 populations in @entity127 with around 200,000 living here , an authoritative report shows			1
migrants have doubled the size of @entity8 ’s gipsy and traveller population , researchers said yesterday			1
it contradicts @entity134 claims that ‘ relatively few @entity119 citizens ’ had set up up home in this country			0
the study ’s ‘ conservative ’ and ‘ increasing ’ figure is four times the 49,000 number estimated four years ago in a report for the @entity142			0
it comes amid concerns at the prospect of a new wave of migration when restrictions on workers from @entity150 and @entity151 are relaxed in january			0
areas where most @entity119 people have settled include @entity154 , the @entity155 and the @entity156 , the study by @entity158 of data from more than 150 councils found			2
it said the term @entity119 applied to ‘ a wide diversity ’ of groups in eastern @entity127 , including gipsies			0
large - scale @entity119 migration , the researchers said , may have begun with the boom in numbers of people seeking asylum in the late 1990s			2
commenting on the report , immigration minister @entity172 said : ‘ the government will continue to enforce the immigration rules and promote voluntary departure schemes to those who have no right to be in the @entity8 – backed up with arrest , detention and enforced removal where individuals refuse to comply with the immigration rules or present a danger to the @entity8 public			2
’ the £ 4,250 figure relates to migrants who have been in @entity8 for less than five years , and was drawn up as part of efforts to quantify how removing them benefits public spending			1
the report adds : ‘ each person living illegally in the @entity8 is estimated to cost up to a further £ 4,250 per year in costs to public services			1
’ the estimate is far from a complete analysis of immigrants to the @entity8 , and does not include other costs or what indirect taxes they may pay such as @entity202			1
the total number of illegal immigrants in the country was estimated by a @entity207 research paper			2
it put the total number of irregular – or illegal – migrants at 618,000 , but said it could be as high as 863,000 or as low as 417,000			2
under @entity213 , ministers proved hugely reluctant to put an estimate on the number of @entity8 ’s illegal migrants			1
in 2005 , the @entity5 said the figure could be as high as 570,000			2
the total includes migrants who sneaked into the country illegally , or over-stayed their visas			2
the government ’s @entity222 , currently passing through @entity224 , is aimed at making it harder for migrants to use public services to which they are not entitled			0
it includes compulsory new rules for landlords – and fines for those who allow illegals to rent			0
it also contains new checks on anyone applying for a driving licence and bank account .			0

each illegal immigrant costs @entity10 £ 4,250 in services , says @entity5
latest figures suggest 863,000 people may be living in the @entity8 illegally
