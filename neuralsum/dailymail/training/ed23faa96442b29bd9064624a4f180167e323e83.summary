progress : the brain of someone with @entity3 , which in later stages , can leave patients unable to walk stem cells could hold the key to treating people paralysed by multiple sclerosis , landmark research has revealed			1
treatment with human stem cells has allowed mice crippled by a version of @entity3 to walk again after less than two weeks			1
scientists admit to being astonished by the result and believe it opens up a new avenue of research in the quest for solutions to @entity3 professor @entity22 , from the @entity23 , who led the @entity25 team , recalled : ' my postdoctoral fellow dr @entity26 came to me and said ‘ the mice are walking ’			1
i did n’t believe her			0
' the genetically engineered mice had a condition that mimics the symptoms of human ms. they were so disabled they could not stand long enough to eat and drink on their own and had to be hand - fed. the scientists transplanted human neural stem cells into the animals expecting them to be rejected and provide no benefit			1
instead the experiment yielded spectacular results			0
within 10 to 14 days , the mice had regained motor skills and were able to walk again			1
six months later , they showed no sign of relapsing			0
the findings , published in the journal @entity50 , suggest the mice experienced at least a partial reversal of their symptoms			2
a similar outcome in humans could help patients with potentially disabling progressive stages of the disease for which there are no treatments			0
' this result opens up a whole new area of research for us to figure out why it worked , ' said co-author dr @entity65 , director of the @entity66 at the @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69			0
' we ’ve long forgotten our original plan			0
' @entity3 is an auto - immune condition caused by the body ’s own defences attacking myelin , the fatty insulation surrounding nerve fibres			1
as myelin is stripped away , nerve impulses can no longer be transmitted properly leading to symptoms ranging from mild tingling to full - blown paralysis			0
drugs that dampen the immune system can slow early forms of the disease , but little can be done for patients in the later stages			0
breakthrough : the scientists transplanted human stem cells into the animals			1
within 10 to 14 days , the mice had regained motor skills and were able to walk again			2
members of the team believe the surprising success may be linked to the way the stem cells were grown in an unusually uncrowded lab dish			1
this led to stem cells that were highly potent , with an enhanced ability to produce certain @entity104 signals from the stem cells instructed each mouse ’s own cells to repair the damage caused by @entity3 , said the scientists			1
one signal was identified as a protein called tgf - beta , raising the prospect of delivering a similar therapy in the form of a drug			0
' rather than having to engraft stem cells into a patient , which can be challenging from a medical standpoint , we might be able to develop a drug that can be used to deliver the therapy much more easily , ' said @entity123			2
he added : ' we want to try to move as quickly and carefully as possible			0
i would love to see something that could promote repair and ease the burden that patients with @entity3 have			2

mice crippled by version of @entity3 could walk again after less than two weeks
were *previously* so disabled they could *n't* stand long enough to be fed
researchers say they had not expected the stem cell treatment to work
these cells may have worked as they were grown in a crowded lab dish
