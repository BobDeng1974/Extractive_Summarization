by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 03:15 est , 9 november 2012 fears are growing that giant @entity3 hornets are headed for @entity4 by 2014 as the killer insects sting a man to death in @entity8			1
a 54 - year - old married father - of - three died in the village of @entity11 on monday after disrupting a hornet ’s nest while pruning a hedge			1
the species , @entity14 , is four times the size of our native honeybees and has decimated the bee population in @entity8			1
deadly pest : this @entity3 hornet species has decimated the bee population in @entity8 , even killing a 54 - year - old man after he disrupted a hornets nest , and it is predicted to reach @entity4 by 2014 the dark invaders with yellow feet are thought to have arrive in south west @entity8 in a delivery of @entity28 pottery from the @entity29 in late 2004			1
the insects have colonised huge swathes of @entity8 , spreading along waterways , and with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in a couple of hours , honey production has plummeted			1
it has colonised 39 of @entity8 ’s 100 administrative departments			2
just last month a nest was discovered just 10 miles from the @entity41 city centre in @entity42 , south of @entity43			1
recently , @entity45 from @entity41 ’ @entity44 predicted that by 2014 , the hornets would be in @entity4			1
impede the plight : @entity41 town hall has launched a strategy to stop the hornets , with beekeepers at the @entity52 ( pictured ) ready with traps he was quoted by @entity55 saying : ‘ we have modelled its potential spread by cross-checking data from @entity8 and @entity3 , and concluded it is capable of living anywhere in @entity62 and certainly in @entity4			1
’ the hornets pick on honeybees as they leave their hive until the colony is so exhausted that the hornets can move in and ransack it			0
groups of @entity3 hornets hover in front of a beehive , picking off single honeybees , decapitating them and stripping off their wings and legs before making off with the ' meat ball ' to feed their young			0
the @entity3 hornet is nearly 2in long with a 3in wingspan - slightly smaller than the @entity62 hornet but much more aggressive one @entity3 hornet can kill 40 bees in a minute ; a handful can destroy a hive of 30,000 beeds in a couple of hours they build rugby ball - shaped nests in trees , housing some 500 hornets they scare off intruders by sending a lone worker hornet to ' warn ' them			0
if that fails , the workers attack en masse worker hornets have lifespans of 30 - 55 days it is a further problem for the @entity4 honeybee , which is struggling to cope with changes in farming and climate and already has one @entity29 invader to contend with - the varroa mite , which feeds on the bees and makes their hives more vulnerable to disease			2
to impede their plight , @entity41 town hall has launched a strategy to trap the hornets			2
ready with traps , beekeepers at the @entity52 and positioned on the roofs of the @entity119 and other @entity41 landmarks are prepared as well as possible human sentries to warn of attacks			2
the deputy mayor of @entity41 , @entity123 warned against panic			0
she told @entity130 : ‘ while the hornet is dangerous , one sting is not deadly for a human			0
but we need to be prepared and be able to locate the nests and think about prevention			0
’ in @entity3 , honeybees have learned to encircle an intruder and , by flapping their wings , cause it to overheat and die			0
but the @entity8 bees have not had enough time to evolve an effective tactic			0
the hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans and has been compared to a hot nail being hammered into the body , but like bee stings , it is likely to kill only if the victim has a severe allergic reaction .			0

a man , 54 , died after disrupting a hornet *'s* nest while pruning a hedge
the @entity14 has decimated bee populations in @entity8 and thought to be heading to @entity41
they have been predicted to arrive in @entity4 by 2014
