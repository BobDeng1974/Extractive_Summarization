the door to @entity2 ’s @entity1 may just have opened a crack for @entity4			1
to find out for sure he must batter @entity6 off his hinges this july , having already pronounced himself willing to fight for a world heavyweight championship soon after that			1
@entity10 knocked when @entity11 flattened @entity12 in @entity13 on saturday night to win the @entity15 title			1
big shot ? @entity4 ( left ) could fight for a world title if he beats @entity6 ( right ) in july new champion : @entity11 celebrates after beating @entity12 to win the @entity15 heavyweight title since @entity11 is promoted by none other than @entity23 all manner of possibilities presented themselves at the knock - out moment , including that of a voluntary defence against @entity4			1
the assumption that saturday night ’s winner would automatically meet his mandatory challenger , ko phenomenon @entity30 , in his next fight were brushed aside by @entity23			2
he of the electrified hair and electrifying rhetoric sees money to be made for @entity37 as well as rejuvenation of his own image while he is back in control of the most cherished of all the heavyweight belts			0
‘ the official challenger does not automatically get the next fight , ’ pronounced @entity23			0
‘ under the rules we are entitled to a voluntary match after winning the title			0
the giant traveller his new boxing gym at @entity52 in @entity53 on tuesday , in partnership with his uncle and trainer @entity56 and his younger but only slightly smaller fighting cousin @entity57			0
@entity4 , he who would become the first member of the travelling community to wear a heavyweight crown , is hoping that a second victory over @entity6 , in this ill - tempered re-match , will deliver his shot against the holder of all the other alpha - belts , @entity66			1
however , the younger of the @entity68 brothers declares himself ‘ super interested ’ in restoring to the family @entity66 the @entity15 title his sibling @entity72 vacated when he committed himself full - time to the political struggle in their homeland			1
that would make @entity66 the first in heavyweight history to wear all the @entity80 , @entity15 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 belts			1
to strengthen his argument he has also expressed ‘ a powerful desire ’ to box in @entity89 for the first time in six years			0
@entity66 has also been instructed by the @entity81 , who have been waiting their turn , to honour their mandatory challenger , @entity94 ’s @entity93			2
hitting the target : @entity11 stopped @entity12 in the sixth round of their fight in @entity13 last weekend game over : @entity11 beat @entity12 for the second time to become the heavyweight champion of the world calling it a day : referee @entity104 steps in to stop the fight between @entity106 and @entity12 to complicate the picture further , not only @entity66 but also @entity72 have written to the @entity15 requesting a fight with @entity37			1
since @entity72 is that organisation ’s champion emeritus they are duty bound to consider his claim , which suggests he may be cutting back his involvement in troubled @entity114 after withdrawing his candidacy for the presidency of @entity68 in forthcoming elections			0
@entity23 , though , is unlikely to be rushed in any of those directions			0
the architect of @entity121 ’s @entity120 with @entity122 and @entity123 ’ in @entity124 against @entity125 – among many historic fights – is relishing his return to the spotlight			2
he will also want to maximise earnings			0
@entity4 could bring the prospect of a big - money fight in @entity132 , or offer himself up as a box - office opponent for @entity37 in @entity134 , where @entity136 ’s first - ever heavyweight champion is now based , or the @entity89			1
back in the big time : @entity23 ( right ) wants to maximise his earnings from his new champion @entity37 up close and personal : @entity4 and @entity6 came face to face at the weekend when promoting their fight calm down : @entity4 will be looking for his second win over @entity6 having outpointed him three years ago the @entity89 people were hoping that @entity12 would bring the world heavyweight title home from @entity148 for the first time in almost a decade			1
instead , they are basking in a little reflected glory as @entity37 restores at least one of the belts to their continent			0
@entity30 , who has blown away all his 31 professional opponents inside four rounds , is their best bet for reclaiming what they long - regarded as the symbol of @entity89 machismo			2
but @entity23 may well see the flamboyant , outspoken fury as not only a marketable opponent but also a softer option than either the @entity165 or the @entity66 brothers			2
even so , whoever takes on @entity106 next has been warned by @entity12 , who was knocked down twice on his way to sixth round defeat and then said of this 35 - year - old late developer : ‘ he hits like a bulldozer			2
’ @entity30 , meanwhile , has been keeping his hand in by beating up an internet troll who called him the n - word on twitter and threatened to tape up his daughter ’s mouth			1
the @entity165 , so - called after his @entity182 medal of that colour , protected himself against prosecution for using his fists against a member of the public by obliging a rather unpleasant individual by the name of @entity190 to sign a waiver and a contract if he wanted to fight him			0
that done , the irregular sparring session then took place in the @entity197 in @entity13 late at night on the eve of the @entity106 - @entity12 world heavyweight title fight			1
@entity190 , who once provoked @entity201 ’s trainer - father into a similar event , was duly knocked down three times – even though the 6ft 7in @entity30 said : ‘ i held back despite my original plan being to hurt this dude real bad			2
he threatened to murder me and called me the n - word			0
‘ but what really got to me was when he said he was going to duck - tape my daughter ’s mouth			0
talk like that about my kids and that ’s when you see the other side of the humble , funny @entity30			2
the part that will come and get you			0
’ that message comes with a health warning to @entity221 , @entity106 , @entity4 and anyone else fancying their chances : do n’t sledge mr @entity30			1
man on a mission : @entity30 ( left ) has knocked out every one of his 31 professional opponents closing in : @entity30 is the mandatory challenger to @entity106 and wants his shot at the @entity15 world champion @entity231 ’s unexpected comeback raises a multitude of enticing possibilities , starting with @entity234 if @entity236 the @entity235 wins his re-match with @entity238 , or a fight with @entity240 if not			1
@entity234 stands at one win apiece with @entity234 , who outpointed the @entity242 a thriller at @entity245 ’s @entity244 a year ago			0
at 35 , he is a five - time super-middleweight champion and his only other defeats came against @entity247 and @entity248			0
@entity234 , as he became a father , seemed about to call time on his 16 - year career but says now : ‘ i do n’t want to go out a loser , after that second fight with @entity234 again ? why not ? ’ he is also eyeing a rematch with @entity248 and a world - title challenge to @entity256 and adds : ‘ @entity234 , @entity238 , @entity248 , @entity256 ... whoever it is i ’ll be ready in october			1
’ not done yet : @entity231 ( left ) has announced his intention to carry on boxing last time out : @entity234 has not fought since losing his rematch to @entity261 last may so , we have @entity263 a world champion at 49 , @entity66 at 38 vowing to reign as heavyweight champion for another ten years , @entity201 , @entity234 and @entity231 still going strong in their mid- 30s …			1
. to name but a few			0
whoever was it who said they never come back ? rip @entity270			2
the former world heavyweight champion who died last week , aged 74 , was laid to rest this very monday in @entity272 , the home - town of himself and his peer @entity121 , who said : ‘ in the world of heavyweights @entity270 was one of the best			1
he had exceptional hand speed and a strong chin but his greatest qualities were his gentle manner and the compassion in his heart			0
i had a kinship with @entity270			2
we were of the same cloth			0
’ @entity121 stopped @entity270 in the 12th of 15 rounds in their only fight but says of him : ‘ great competitors who happen to be great friends are rare			1
@entity270 was that to me and i will miss him			0
’ back in the day : @entity121 ( right ) stopped @entity270 in the 12th round of their heavyweight clash remembered : @entity270 , who gave @entity121 a tough fight , passed away aged 74 after a battle with dementia as @entity300 misses so many of the great men with whom he shared a ring but who , incredibly while he is engaged in his long battle with @entity305 ’s , he has survived			1
men like @entity125 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315			0
all gone ... while the miracle of @entity121 lives on			0
one of the best : @entity121 praised @entity270 , saying he had excellent hand speed as well as a strong chin take that : @entity125 connects to the body of @entity270 who misses with a right during their fight in 1970			1

@entity11 beat @entity12 to win the @entity15 heavyweight title
he could fight @entity4 if @entity4 beats @entity6 in july
@entity66 also wants to fight @entity11
@entity30 taught an internet troll a lesson in the gym
@entity231 eyes fight with @entity261 or @entity238
@entity270 , who fought @entity121 , was laid to rest on monday
