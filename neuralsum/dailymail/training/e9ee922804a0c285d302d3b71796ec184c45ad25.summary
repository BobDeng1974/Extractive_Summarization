@entity0 is poised to fulfil two lifelong ambitions by fighting @entity2 at @entity4 ’s @entity3 this june and @entity5 in @entity6 in the autumn			1
the @entity8 is expected to relinquish his @entity10 supermiddleweight belt on tuesday , allowing negotiations to be finalised for two defences of his @entity14 world championship			1
@entity0 is set to vacate his @entity10 world title having not fought since beating @entity17 last may @entity0 had been due to face @entity5 in march but had to withdraw with an injury that decision also clears the way for @entity21 to fight for the vacant @entity10 title			1
@entity0 , at 37 , intends bringing his career to a climax with the two fights			1
both @entity2 , the 50 - year - old phenomenon of the ring , and @entity28 , same - name son of the legendary @entity31 fighter , are willing to meet him			0
@entity0 had always hoped to fight at the @entity3 and has come to cherish the prospect of boxing in @entity6 before hanging up his gloves			1
the chance of doing both has convinced him to vacate the @entity10 title , which he would have been required to defend against @entity21 in april			1
@entity0 feels he has nothing to prove against younger domestic rivals following two victories over @entity17			1
@entity21 ( left ) is the mandatory challenger for the @entity10 title and is set to fight for it at the @entity42 in april @entity21 ( right ) earned the no 1 spot by stopping @entity44 in impressive fashion at @entity46 @entity21 lost a contentious decision to @entity17 in 2011 and a rematch seems inevitable in the future both fights were deemed mandatory defences by the @entity10 , though @entity17 was not the leading contender			1
@entity0 says : ‘ i ’m not going to be rail - roaded into doing the same against @entity21 , who would need at least another fight or two against quality opposition before being ready for me			1
’ the alternatives for @entity57 will be detailed this morning by promoter @entity58			1
@entity21 , his own chance of glory finally at hand , and @entity62 , the @entity63 cancer survivor , are the mandatory rivals for the @entity10 title about to fall vacant			1
@entity58 is keen to put that on at @entity67 ’s @entity42 on april 25			1
but @entity62 is reluctant to return to @entity68			0
he feels he was robbed of the decision in a close fight with @entity0 in @entity71			1
unless @entity62 can raise the financial stakes to take the fight to @entity63 , @entity21 will need another contender			0
a return with @entity17 , who beat him in their first match , would be big box - office here , but @entity17 is pursuing his mandatory world - title challenge to @entity62 ’s brother , @entity82 , the @entity83 champion			1
@entity17 looked less than impressive against @entity84 in @entity85 last november @entity17 is the mandatory challenger for the @entity83 super-middleweight title held by @entity88 one of @entity0 ’s bravest and most honourable rivals , @entity90 , is calling it a career after being left out of the current super-middleweight world title loop			1
the @entity94 , who turns 37 himself shortly , hoped for a last hurrah against either @entity0 or the stand - out for latterly inactive champion @entity97			1
@entity90 was seeking either a rubber match with @entity0 – their series stands at one win each – or the chance to avenge defeat by @entity97			2
@entity90 beat @entity0 via unanimous decision in 2010 but lost the rematch on points in 2013 he says : ‘ since neither wanted it i ’m in a state of retirement			2
i was approached about @entity21 or @entity17 but i ’m not interested			0
only a big fight against a big name would have given me the motivation to get back into full - out training			0
’ @entity90 bows out with a record of 36 wins against only three defeats			0
the other loss was against @entity118 on a memorable world championship night in @entity120			2
he goes with enormous respect , not only in @entity122 where his a folk hero but throughout the wide world of boxing			2
the final bell tolled at the weekend for a friend not only of boxing but of virtually everyone in the hard old game @entity130 climbed out of shoe - shining poverty in @entity132 to become a true gentleman of a promoter in the midst of the rough and tumble of boxing in @entity137 , with his unfailing good manners and acquired cut - glass @entity68 accent , @entity130 charmed us all while taking kindly and generous care of the careers of such notables as @entity144			2
@entity130 was the popular promoter of @entity145 and @entity144 the zenith of his career came in @entity132 in 2001 , at the temporary expense of our own @entity149			2
@entity130 ’s big man @entity145 pulled off the shock ko of @entity149 to give him his only promotional share in the winning of the world heavyweight title			2
the satisfaction was short - lived			0
electric - haired promoter @entity156 arrived in @entity158 bearing a bag full of half - a - million dollars with which to lure @entity145 away from @entity130			0
@entity149 was to retrieve the title in the re-match			0
@entity130 went on to win his own battle , against obesity			0
‘ the elephant in the room is now a greyhound , ’ he proudly announced			0
but the physical strain of it all brought on a massive heart attack , at just 66			0
the star had dimmed for the man who famously brought boxing to @entity137 ’s iconic @entity173			0
but as times became harder @entity130 was looked after by such as the current leading @entity137 promoter @entity178 , fight - loving businessman @entity175 and @entity176 boxing writer - turned - lawyer @entity179			2
none of us will forget the long nights in renowned @entity184 restaurants listening to @entity130 tell his colourful life stories			0
as he would have put it himself : ‘ good night , my dear friend			0
it honestly has been the most tremendous pleasure			0

@entity0 set to make an *announcement* on his future on tuesday
promoter @entity58 hinted @entity0 will vacate his @entity10 world title
