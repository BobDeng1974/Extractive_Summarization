@entity1 's arrival at @entity2 has been met with popular approval from the @entity5 fanbase and the love affair with their new boss has continued following the unveiling of a giant billboard in the city			2
only a month into the @entity2 hotseat @entity12 can now be seen spread across @entity14 in @entity16 's @entity15 with the caption ' welcome to @entity18 ' on a red background			1
