@entity0 believes it is inevitable that @entity2 will win the @entity3 but warns that his club must compete for club football ’s biggest prize on an annual basis if they are to be considered among @entity9 ’s great teams			1
the city manager , preparing for tuesday ’s home group meeting with @entity12 at the @entity13 , is convinced that it is only a matter of time before the multi millions invested by the clubs @entity18 ownership reap the ultimate reward			1
but @entity0 , who performed minor miracles in @entity3 campaigns at unfashionable @entity23 sides @entity22 and @entity24 , knows that is only the beginning of the challenge facing @entity2			1
@entity0 believes that @entity2 will win the @entity3 in the near future @entity0 's title in his debut @entity32 season has made him a much - loved figure in @entity34 and having set his side a minimum target of a place in the last eight of this season ’s competition - one round better than 12 months ago - @entity0 has outlined the requirement for his club moving forward			1
' i am absolutely sure we will do it			0
it ’s very important to win the @entity3			2
we hope we will win it this year , ' said @entity0			1
' but suppose we do			0
after that it will be finished			0
it ’s a good achievement but then you must do it every year			0
sometimes it will be the final , sometimes the semi-final			0
how many @entity3 do @entity53 have ? two when @entity54 had his project			0
' winning the @entity3 is one of the projects but we must also continue winning @entity32 titles and @entity59 cups and to arrive in the semi-finals and not to be eliminated at the group stage			1
' @entity62 could not save @entity64 's last minute strike that saw @entity2 defeated by @entity65 city have tended to struggle in the latter stages of the @entity3 and in their groups @entity0 wants his charges to pick up more @entity32 titles but knows they need to impact on @entity9 @entity0 , having led @entity2 to the @entity32 title and @entity73 in his debut season in @entity76 football , has set high standards since replacing @entity78			1
but the @entity79 is painfully aware that domestic success is only half the story if his club want to be considered in the same breath as current group rivals @entity65 and other @entity86 heavyweights			0
' if you want to be a really big team you must be involved in both competitions – @entity9 and in @entity76 - and to be a strong team , not only to be comfortable with winning just once , ' he said			1
' our target is to be successful in the @entity3 and the @entity32 , both			2
@entity95 or @entity96 or @entity65 or the teams playing in other leagues , if they are not involved in one of the competitions it is not good for them			0
' they must always be fighting for the domestic title and also in @entity9			2
that is what this club must need to do in the future and it is one of our targets			0
' @entity112 and @entity113 will be missing for @entity2 against @entity12 , along with @entity114 despite his frank analysis of the situation , @entity0 is also conscious of not placing himself under too much pressure by guaranteeing success this season , especially given the club ’s modest efforts in even qualifying from group play in past seasons			1
' it ’s not the death of the club if we can not do it this year , ' he said			0
' we must be very patient			0
the most important thing is that we are growing in all senses , not just trying to win titles			2
' @entity0 expects to be without the injured @entity114 , @entity112 and @entity113 on tuesday but the tie offers one intriguing potential reunion - that of @entity2 loanee @entity133 and his former @entity135 and @entity76 team mate @entity134 , who has since joined the @entity137 club			1
@entity134 and @entity133 , both formerly of @entity135 , could be reunited on the @entity13 pitch on tuesday			2
