victim 2 : 17 - year - old who met @entity5 during early 1970s filming of it 's a knockout			1
he pushed her against a hotel door and fumbled her until she fought him off			2
victim 3 : @entity66 , formerly @entity67 , who waived her right to anonymity			0
@entity52 in @entity69 in 1974 when she was 16 or 17			0

victim 6 : was 15 when she met @entity5 as he worked on @entity85			1
he kissed her in her home and on a later date approached her with a battery - powered massager which he asked to use on her private parts when she used his dressing room to get changed			0
victims 7 , 8 and 9 : an 11 - year - old , 14 - year - old and another girl aged 13 or 14 who attended elocution lessons together at @entity5 's home			1

he took her to his bedroom and told her to take her clothes off , where he held a tape measure around her chest as she practised saying sentences			0
mr @entity18 said that his client - later jailed for 15 months - had been arrested ‘ as a consequence ’ of the investigation into @entity133 ‘ who used young girls on a scale that is simply staggering ’			1
he referred to the 1,300 complainants in that case and said : ‘ instead , in the dock today is a frightened and bewildered 83 - year - old man answering for the touching - no more , no less - of all of 13 , not 1,300 , victims over a quarter of a century ago			0
’ he said many years had passed since the last offence and that @entity5 had led an ‘ unblemished life ’ over those years , doing charity work and with the support of his loving family			1
the barrister said the defendant had pleaded guilty and that there was ‘ very little evidence ’ of sexual arousal on the part of the defendant			0
‘ inevitably some of the victims were more affected than others			0
in the main victims appear to have kept their undoubtedly unpleasant experiences in proportion to the actual abuse they suffered			0
‘ in many cases this appears to have manifested itself in them being revolted by the sight or sound of the defendant on television or radio			0
’ referring to the victims who were assaulted during @entity5 's ‘ elocution lessons ’ mr @entity18 said they had expressed a ‘ degree of ambivalence in regard to what happened to them ’			1
he said one victim told police the assault was ‘ not a serious indecent assault ’ and she was thankful that nothing worse happened			0
mr @entity18 said many of the victims had the similar ‘ refrain ’ in that they told police they had come forward out of concern that the defendant may do the same to others , or something more serious than what happened to them			0
the barrister also said that many of the victims had told their parents about the abuse at the time but that they had taken no action			0
he said with the exception of two of the complainants , all the victims who were under 16 had told an adult and none of them had contacted police or sought to take it up with the defendant			0
mr @entity18 said he was not criticising ‘ any of those adults ’ or saying that ‘ standards were different in the 70s ’			0
but he said it did ‘ reflect on the minor nature of the abuse ’ - with the one exception of the 13 - year - old girl @entity5 attacked in a bathroom , which he conceded was a more serious assault			2
mr @entity18 said that even at the ‘ height of his fame ’ @entity5 took the time to write to fans , many of them ‘ elderly and lonely ’ and that @entity5 still had the ‘ love and support of his family			2
’ the barrister rubbished claims in a newspaper that @entity5 had spent years ‘ laughing in the faces of his victims ’ and said that it was @entity5 's ‘ celebrity ’ which had brought him to the attention of the police			1
he said ‘ but for his celebrity ’ the offences ‘ would never have seen the light of day			0
’ distancing itself : the @entity10 ( headquarters in central @entity243 pictured ) said it did not supply a character reference for @entity5 - and the views ' were of a volunteer speaking in a personal capacity ' jailed : veteran @entity59 broadcaster @entity5 arrives at @entity15 where he was later sentenced he said @entity5 ‘ brought laughter to millions ’ as the presenter of it 's a @entity253 , the latter of which reached a @entity255 tv audience of 200 million people			1
the lawyer said @entity5 then went on to be an accomplished football reporter on the radio renowned for his ‘ linguistic craftsmanship ’			2
he said @entity5 was frail and suffering from numerous health problems and had suffered from depression and anxiety since his arrest			2
he said @entity5 's comments outside magistrates ' court when he said his accusers were telling ‘ spurious ’ and ‘ pernicious lies ’ were ‘ ill - advised ’			1
' one can only begin to imagine the defendant 's fear as the cell door slams shut on that first night ' @entity7 , defending @entity5 mr @entity18 also criticised the probation officers who wrote the pre-sentence report , saying they ‘ did not like mr @entity5 ’			1
he said : ‘ one of them said , ' i hope you get five years and they take you for every penny that you 've got			0
’ ' the judge called these remarks ‘ disgraceful ’			0
mr @entity18 said the nature of fame had changed over the years and that in the 60s and 70s it was a ‘ different world ’			0
he said @entity5 was 83 and would find prison very hard , adding : ‘ one can only begin to imagine the defendant 's fear as the cell door slams shut on that first night			1
’ the @entity10 posted the following statement on its official @entity292 site : ‘ we 'd like to clarify that the @entity10 did not supply a character reference for @entity5			1
‘ the views were of a volunteer speaking in a personal capacity and do not in any way reflect the views of the @entity10			2
’ a spokesman for the charity later added : ' the volunteer concerned has now stood down from her role with the @entity10			1
' our priority is , and always will be , to the victims of child abuse and we will not allow anything to get in the way of this			0
