when @entity1 paid @entity2 £ 32million this summer to make @entity4 the most expensive defender in the history of @entity7 football , it was with a view to keeping goals out			1
on saturday , the @entity10 fell some way short of expectations			0
he scored an own - goal and conceded a penalty as the @entity16 champions surrendered a two - goal lead at the @entity18			1
@entity20 ’s side recovered to secure their first win in four league games with a decisive goal from @entity24 and @entity25 ’s fourth in a week , but the result should not paper over the fact that this game proved every bit as challenging for @entity4 as his debut against @entity33 last weekend			1
@entity25 is congratulated by @entity34 after scoring @entity1 's fourth and final goal at the @entity18 @entity25 was in the right place at the right time to convert @entity34 's cross for his fourth goal in his last three matches @entity24 celebrates his strike to put @entity1 3 - 2 ahead against @entity42 @entity24 ( on the floor ) squeezed the ball past defender @entity45 and goalkeeper @entity46 to score @entity1 's third @entity48 sweeps home a penalty to draw @entity42 level at 2 - 2 on 32 minutes after @entity4 conceded the spot - kick with a high boot @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 trudge back to kick - off after @entity42 pulled themselves back on to level terms the home supporters take great pleasure in taunting the @entity1 fans as @entity48 celebrates his equalising goal with a glance to the heavens @entity4 looks dejected after conceding the own goal that allowed @entity42 back into the match @entity67 miles @entity42 110.4 68.6 @entity68 90 11.0 6.8 @entity69 90 10.9 6.8 @entity45 90 10.7 6.7 @entity1 109.4 68.0 @entity70 90 12.7 7.9 @entity54 90 10.9 6.8 @entity24 90 10.2 6.3 he passed that test with flying colours			1
this one did not go quite so smoothly			0
there was no one near the @entity10 when @entity45 crossed into the box from the right flank in the 21st minute , having beaten @entity78 far too easily			2
@entity4 craned his neck and guided the ball over @entity81 into the top corner			1
there was a sympathetic pat on the back from captain @entity55 but worse was to follow in the 31st minute			0
@entity86 clipped the ball towards @entity48 inside the box and @entity4 looked every inch a lumbering centre - back as he launched into a clumsy challenge , sinking his boot into the @entity95 striker ’s midriff			1
referee @entity96 pointed to the spot and @entity48 slotted home			2
those kind of mistakes could prove far more costly against @entity101 in the @entity102 on tuesday night , but @entity20 was quick to defend his player			0
‘ you can not analyse a player from one match , not when he played wonderfully in the last game and everybody said he was the best defender in the world , ’ said the @entity1 boss			2
‘ he has played in the @entity102 , won titles with @entity2 and is in the @entity10 national squad			0
we can not analyse because he was unlucky or made a mistake			0
he ’s a very good player and will continue playing in our team			0
‘ i think the own - goal was very unlucky			0
to score from where he did is very difficult			0
it made @entity4 a little bit nervous and he gave away the penalty			2
but he played very well in the second half which was n’t easy with a yellow card			0
’ @entity1 goalkeeper @entity81 is left helpless as @entity4 diverts the ball past him for an own goal @entity24 celebrates with strike partner @entity53 after doubling @entity1 's lead after 11 minutes neither goal was the fault of @entity129 , who kept his place in goal following the seven - goal thrashing of @entity133 in the @entity134 in midweek , but will relinquish it to @entity135 against @entity101			1
‘ for @entity81 it was good to play not just one but two games , ’ added @entity20			0
‘ @entity135 had played eight games in 32 days so that ’s a lot of games for a goalkeeper			0
’ for the opening 11 minutes it looked as though @entity1 could do without a goalkeeper altogether as they raced into a two - goal lead			1
@entity53 was the recipient of @entity34 ’s knockdown in the seventh minute , swivelling to hook the ball past @entity46 and into the far corner			1
there were more serious question marks over @entity42 ’s defending when @entity24 got the second four minutes later			1
@entity24 is obscured by @entity152 and @entity45 as he curls the ball into the top corner from 20 yards for @entity1 's second goal @entity53 celebrates his seventh - minute goal which gave @entity1 the lead at the @entity18 the @entity158 spun into space inside the @entity42 box and fired home on the half - volley to put the champions in front early on @entity42 : @entity46 5.5 ; @entity45 6.5 , @entity152 6.5 , @entity165 6 , @entity166 5.5 ( @entity167 83 ) ; @entity68 6 , @entity168 6.5 , @entity69 6 , @entity169 5.5 ( @entity170 74 , 6 ) ; @entity48 6.5 ( @entity171 74 , 6 ) , @entity172 7 substitutes not used : @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 scorers : @entity4 own goal 21 ; @entity48 pen 32 @entity1 : @entity129 5 , @entity34 6.5 , @entity4 4.5 , @entity78 5.5 , @entity55 6.5 , @entity180 7 ( @entity181 76 , 6 ) , @entity56 6 ( @entity182 66 , 6 ) , @entity54 6.5 , @entity70 6 , @entity53 6.5 ( @entity25 71 , 7 ) , @entity24 8 substitutes not used : @entity135 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 scorers : @entity53 7 ; @entity24 11 , 68 ; @entity25 87 booked : @entity4 , @entity78 referee : @entity96 6 @entity188 man : @entity53 player ratings by @entity189 at the @entity18 the @entity191 striker still had plenty to do when @entity180 found him on the edge of the box			1
two markers stood off him and @entity24 cut inside before sending a magnificent effort curling into the top corner			1
that was the cue for @entity4 to go into meltdown as @entity42 levelled before half - time with a magnificent fightback			1
@entity42 boss @entity173 said : ‘ it shows the character that we rolled up our sleeves up and got back into it			2
‘ for a good hour , it could have gone either way			0
we gave it a right good go , but it just did n’t go for us			0
’ @entity4 blocks a @entity172 shot with his outstretched leg as @entity42 threaten the @entity1 goal @entity165 attempts to block a cross from @entity34 as @entity1 pour forward in search of the winning goal after @entity54 had rattled the post with a thunderous 30 - yard strike , @entity24 nudged @entity1 back in front with a far less impressive effort in the 68th minute			1
@entity220 was the provider , sliding the ball to his team - mate inside the box			0
@entity24 ’s shot bobbled under @entity45 ’s body and agonisingly wide of @entity46 ’s outstretched fingers on its way inside the far post			1
@entity24 is surrounded by @entity42 defenders as he attempts to fire off a shot from just inside the penalty box @entity68 tries to get the better of @entity78 and cross from near the touchline as @entity42 go on the offensive @entity53 gets ahead of @entity86 as he tries to instigate another @entity1 attack after scoring a dramatic late equaliser against his old club @entity33 and two more in midweek , it was no surprise that @entity25 weighed in with another after coming off the bench			1
he arrived to meet @entity34 ’s pass and stroke the ball home from close range			0
it will no doubt fuel the debate about how long @entity1 can delay @entity25 ’s move to @entity249			2
‘ i was absolutely sure that @entity25 could continue being a very important player , ’ said @entity20			0
‘ at 36 , he ca n’t play three ( full ) games in a week but nobody can be surprised at the way @entity25 is playing			2
’ @entity135 looks miserable sat on the bench after being replaced by @entity81 as @entity25 signs autographs for the home fans at the @entity18 @entity25 sits next to @entity135 on the @entity1 bench ahead of kick - off at the @entity18 like our @entity259 .			2

@entity53 fired @entity1 into an early *advantage* with a half - volley on the turn after seven minutes
@entity24 doubled the champions ' lead four minutes later with a curling effort into the top corner
@entity42 were given hope when @entity4 put a @entity45 cross through his own net
and the @entity275 equalised when @entity48 converted a penalty after @entity4 was penalised for high boot
@entity24 *restored* @entity1 's lead after 68 minutes , squeezing in shot from tight angle after good work from @entity53
@entity25 then tapped in from @entity34 's pull - back for his fourth goal of the week
result means @entity1 are five points behind early pace - *setters* @entity33
