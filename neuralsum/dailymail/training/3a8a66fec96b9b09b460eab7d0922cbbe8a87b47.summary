a father is suing his son 's high school track coach because the teenager did n't make the team			1
@entity5 filed a lawsuit asking for $ 40million on behalf of his 16 - year - old son @entity7 , as well as the varsity letters and championship jackets for the past two seasons			2
' children have rights , just like any adult , ' mr @entity5 told the @entity14			0
standing their ground : @entity5 ( left ) filed a $ 40million lawsuit because his son @entity7 was kicked off of his high school 's track team even though he was one of the quickest runners @entity7 was kicked off the @entity22 team in @entity23 , @entity24 , and the school says it was because of unexcused absences			1
mr @entity5 contradicts that , saying that his son had a leg injury and a death in the family that caused him to miss certain practices			2
instead , he said that the falling out with the coach after he would not put him in the events he was best suited for			2
the school did not comment on the matter because of the ongoing legal action			0
mr @entity5 did not name the coach as the only plaintiff in the lawsuit , as he also included the school athletic director , the principal , as well as the school superintendent and the members of the school board			1
he would not specify how exactly the came to the asking amount of $ 40million for the lawsuit , though it is clear that they are concerned with @entity7 's career			0
mr @entity5 said that his son was the ' undefeated champ ' in the middle school 200 - , 400 - , and 800 - runs at his catholic school in eighth grade			2
then when he went on to @entity22 , the coach reportedly did not allow him to run those races , but not because he was slow , rather showing partiality towards older students			1
no comment : the coach and all employees of the school would not release a statement because of the ongoing legal drama defense : the school says that the son had unexcused absences from practice , but his father said it was because of an injury and a death in the family ' if he does n't qualify , then the clock will say he 's not fast enough , ' mr @entity5 told @entity74			1
mr @entity5 , who is a disabled veteran who was also a runner in his youth , believes that his son 's lack of exposure will hurt him when it comes time to seeking a college athletic scholarship			1
aside from that , the suit is based around the charge that @entity7 was bullied and harassed as a result of his failure to make the team			0
' i felt in a way , disrespected , ' @entity7 told the @entity14			0
' at practice , i work hard and i try to be the best athlete i can be , but at meet time , i did n't get the respect that i thought i deserved			0
' even without @entity7 , the team did fine on their own having won the track sectionals this season with the help of some athletes still on the team .			0
