@entity0 spoke on the eve of this match about his squad ' embracing ' the @entity4 , the often - maligned competition presenting an opportunity to reboot what has been an underwhelming season			1
such @entity10 occasions were ' in the club 's dna ' , said the @entity13 , and they would be doing everything to triumph in the @entity16 final on may 27			2
@entity17 , the £ 28million man who has so often embodied their travails this season , has clearly bought into his vision			1
@entity17 ( right ) gets past @entity22 to head @entity23 in front after 24 minutes of play @entity17 celebrates after he opened the scoring for @entity23 in their @entity4 round of 32 first - leg tie @entity17 taps in @entity29 's low fizzed cross to grab his second goal and put @entity23 3 - 1 ahead the @entity32 striker is congratulated by his @entity23 team - mate @entity33 following his brace magnificent last season , when his 15 goals in 31 league matches powered @entity23 's tilt at the @entity39 places , @entity17 has n't been able to scale the same heights this term			1
his goals have been fewer and further between , his form patchy on too many occasions			1
put bluntly , the @entity32 had not played like a club record striker			2
but here , on a freezing cold evening in the @entity50 capital of @entity51 , he was just magnificent			1
with a splendid hat - trick , plus many other important contributions , @entity17 inspired @entity23 to the kind of assured @entity10 away performance @entity0 needs if they are to claim the second @entity10 trophy of their grand old history , 30 years after the first			1
he made light of all the pre-match angst and anxiety - the plastic pitch , the in - form @entity50 opposition , the injured troops who had n't made the trip - with a performance that lifted his team - mates too			1
@entity17 looks to the heavens after he completes his first hat - trick in @entity23 colours @entity17 , of course , has a @entity39 winners ' medal from his @entity77 days but their 2012 triumph was not one he wished to be associated with			1
he had not played a minute in their winning run and did n't want to touch the trophy , feeling he had no right to			0
this is a 21 - year - old who wants to write his own history and , who knows , he might sooner that expected			2
wearing pristine white moulds on the artificial surface , he was alert and involved right from the first whistle , running off the defenders and generally making a nuisance of himself			0
on three minutes , he directed a firm header towards the bottom corner from @entity96 's cross but goalkeeper @entity97 did very well to tip it around the post			0
@entity23 had started brightly and did n't deserve to fall behind through @entity100			2
but @entity17 led the fightback			2
his fierce effort from the edge of the box again forced @entity105 into reflex action but he would n't be denied a third time			0
@entity108 met an @entity96 cross from the left wing			0
this time it found the bottom corner , his 11th goal of the season			0
@entity115 fires in a 28th minute strike to give @entity23 the lead after @entity100 's equaliser every time the ball was in his vicinity , he was demanding it , stretching out his arms before him demanding another touch			1
in the air , he did n't lose a duel all night			0
and after @entity115 had given @entity23 the lead , @entity17 added a third before the break			1
he gravitated to the back post and tapped in after @entity29 's low cross fizzed cross			0
there was an accusation of offside , but the linesman was n't moved			0
out in the @entity136 , @entity135 joked at half - time : ' looks like @entity17 will get that move to a big club now			1
' it was a form of praise for his performance from across the @entity144 divide			0
early in the second - half , the striker showed his maturity by dragging @entity148 away from a flare - up after a late tackle			2
and the @entity152 man soon repaid the favour			0
spotting @entity17 's burst , @entity148 placed a slide - rule pass and the striker 's long legs did the rest			1
scorching clear , he deftly lifted the ball past the keeper for his first hat - trick since scoring three past @entity162 for @entity163 in sir @entity165 's last game in may 2013			1
@entity17 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity23 manager @entity0 following his superb display in @entity51 he celebrated on his knees , pointing to the heavens , knowing this was a display that would electrify his campaign at last			1
@entity23 then threatened to self - destruct , as @entity174 saw red for hauling down @entity100 in the box			1
fortunately for the @entity152 guests , his penalty was high , wide and woeful			0
with his team down to 10 men , @entity17 inevitably became more peripheral but the work ethic was still there			2
he earned an ovation from the travelling fans after haring 40 yards to chase what many strikers would deem a lost cause			0
there was one blot on the copybook , a poor miscue right in front of goal after @entity193 had crossed			0
when three goals ahead , it 's far easier to forgive a miss like that			2
likewise with another one - on - one opportunity late on , which drew a flying save from @entity200			0
he was replaced seconds later , earning another standing ovation			0
and how he deserved it after @entity23 's @entity50 roll .			1

@entity23 defeated @entity206 4 - 1 in @entity51
@entity17 scored his first hat - trick for the @entity23 during the win
the @entity23 striker scored 15 goals in 31 league matches last season
the @entity23 duly *signed* the on - loan striker for £ 28million
but @entity17 has struggled to *reproduce* last season 's form
