' he was 95 - years - old when i started working , which was 10 years ago - we just waited a bit longer to make sure he is past 100 '			1
if @entity1 's age is in fact correct , the senior bird would have been born around @entity29 in 1915 , flying his way through a hundred years of memories			1

similarly to human 's noses , bird 's beaks grow with age			0
@entity18 manager , @entity81 , gave @entity1 his special birthday cake			1
@entity1 apparently has a huge crush on her - it made his day ' because his beak keeps growing as he gets older we have had to monitor it by making sure we feed him food that helps to slow it down , ' mr @entity19 said			2
but for @entity1 's birthday , sanctuary workers allowed the birthday - boy to indulge			1
' we got him a special cake which was all made of natural ingredients - honey based bird seeds and nuts - he enjoyed it so much			0

' it says a lot about @entity1 who is able to develop such a great interaction with kids - he represents all animals			2
' if it helps a child to have a moment with an animal like @entity1 , well that goes a long way - teaching them how to respect animals			2
' mr @entity19 said he has seen a few cockatoos reach 120 - years - old but none quite like @entity1			1
' he is a special boy to all of us - he brings a lot of life			0
