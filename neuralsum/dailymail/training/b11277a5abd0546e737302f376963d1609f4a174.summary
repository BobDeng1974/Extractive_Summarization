dr @entity0 , former @entity1 chancellor of @entity2 's , said it is ' ridiculous ' that @entity4 , former archbishop of @entity5 , used his @entity7 message to continue a ' peculiar obsession with gay sex ' from my parish next to the @entity13 in @entity14 , you can just about make out the top of the @entity16 over the @entity18 council flats			1
as the crow flies , it is just a couple of miles away			1
but the people who live round here do not feel close to the sources of power or have much trust that it works on their behalf			1
likewise , from here you can see the skyscrapers of the @entity31			1
but again , it is another world			1
commuters know my parish as a route to somewhere else			1
every day , many thousands drive around the notorious roundabout or rumble through on the @entity39 ’s @entity38 , which goes directly under the vicarage			1
they often do n’t give much thought to those stuck in bedsits or struggling to bring up children with no work			1
to be poor is to feel desperately ignored			1
as if your voice can not ever be heard			1
@entity7 , of course , is a time of hope			1
but hope is not exactly the same as optimism – at least not the sort of cheap optimism we get from our politicians , who are inevitably slaves to the electoral cycle and want to talk up every policy intervention as if it were going to change the world			1
the @entity59 , however , is not looking to get elected			1
and when we speak of hope it is not because we believe things are going to get better in the next six months			1
@entity62 is simply the belief that there is no darkness that can not be overcome			1
that at the heart of the universe there is something so fundamentally good and kind that it can absorb all disasters – even crucifixion			1
@entity62 , then , is the defiance of love , defiance against what can feel like a bleak reality			1
it is built on the promise that love is stronger than death			1
and because of this , there is nothing of which we need to be afraid			1
this is the good news of @entity7 – which is why it ’s so ridiculous that former archbishop of canterbury @entity4 has used his own @entity7 message to continue his peculiar obsession with gay sex			1
it is hardly earth - shattering good news if we reduce the @entity94 to some narrow moralism that seeks to police how people love each other			1
referring to dr @entity4 's comments as ' narrow moralism ' , dr @entity0 said we should not ' seek to police how people love each other ' in his attack on @entity103 , @entity4 accused the prime minister of doing more than any recent political leader to feed the anxieties of those @entity107 who feel part of ‘ a persecuted minority ’			1
to speak of @entity107 being persecuted in this country is an insult to those people in places such as @entity114 and @entity115 who really are			1
but if the @entity94 that @entity107 celebrate on this day is all about some ultimate promise that all will be well , it is not an easy promise to live by			1
the new @entity121 has recently insisted that the @entity59 has to make itself poor			2
this is not simply out of solidarity with those on the margins			2
still less is it political , though it may have political consequences			2
over the centuries , the @entity59 has done too much to glamorise poverty when it is right and proper that we ought to be helping people find a route out of it			1
nevertheless , there is a wisdom that comes with being poor			2
or rather , there is something the poor just can not avoid that the wealthy find it easier to hide from – that we are all vulnerable , dependent creatures			2
in his attack on @entity103 , @entity4 accused the prime minister of doing more than any recent political leader to feed the anxieties of those @entity107 who feel part of ' a persecuted minority ' the problem with having lots of money is that it can fool us into believing we are ultimately self - sufficient			1
money can become life ’s artificial protection mechanism against the fact that we are all going to die			2
it does n’t matter what designer clothes we wear			2
or what fancy restaurants we eat in			2
or whether we live in a penthouse and earn squillions in the @entity31			2
we are all subject to the same basic logic that human existence is limited			2
from the perspective of eternity , the short - term optimism of politicians is a trifle , and matters relatively little			2
the @entity59 has in mind a bigger picture when is speaks of hope			2
so , for instance , when @entity174 famously insisted that ‘ all will be well , all manner of things will be well ’ she was surrounded by people struck down by the @entity180			1
it was n’t any sort of optimism that made her say this			2
it was something so much more basic , so much more elemental			2
they have no illusion of self - sufficiency and so have a natural empathy with the idea that ultimate security comes from outside of ourselves			0
over this bitter winter , we opened up our church as a night shelter for the homeless , something that is dramatically on the rise again			0
makeshift beds were set up between the pews and around the font			0
the people who came to the church were a mixture and there was no obvious common feature			1
but they were all desperate , one way or another			0
and they all knew they needed help			0
that ’s the thing the poor know that the rich sometimes do n’t – that we all need help			0
early this morning , just before dawn , i will bring into church a lighted candle , symbolising the new light of the @entity94 and its ability to triumph over the darkness			0
one of the fears i always have is that a random gust of wind will blow the candle out and that the whole symbolism of light defeating darkness will be lost			0
but there is symbolism in this fear , too			0
the flame of the candle seems such a fragile thing when set against the problems of the world			0
can the faith that i have in the ultimate goodness of things really take on the challenges of our society ? what is this little flame against the drug needles that i have to clear up outside the church most weeks ? what is this little flame against the stabbings and the gangs and the loneliness ? but from this flame , we light all the candles in the church			0
and suddenly the place is full of light			0
and then we will sing about thanksgiving and hope			0
there is nothing naive about all of this			0
it is not a belief that we can magic away the social problems that exist in this part of @entity14			0
i have little doubt the same problems will be just as much in evidence next @entity7			0
i am not really much of an optimist			0
but i know for sure that the needles will not have the last word			0
the @entity94 is not something you believe as some simple intellectual proposition			0
that ’s pretty difficult , for obvious reasons			0
but it is something you live your life by			0
it is the compass that always points towards the rising of the new dawn			0
and those of us who set our course by this compass will not be deterred by the depressing state of the economy or its consequences			0
our hope is given from elsewhere			0
yes , this can be scary and precarious			0
the source of our hope is not in our power to direct or even fully to understand			0
but if this is a form of foolishness , the deeper foolishness is to believe that we can escape from the dependency on things that are outside of our control			0
in reality , none of us can do this .			0
