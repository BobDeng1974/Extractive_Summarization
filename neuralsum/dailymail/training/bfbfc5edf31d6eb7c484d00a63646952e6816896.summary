the @entity0 was yesterday condemned by the spending watchdog for paying its staff £ 24million to move to @entity3 without asking for receipts to prove their relocation expenses claims			1
mps accused the corporation of overseeing a ‘ colossal waste of money ’ after the @entity8 found 894 staff were handed an average of £ 23,000 each , inlcuding 11 who received more than £ 100,000 for homes worth between £ 500,000 and £ 1million			1
the money was to compensate them for the cost of moving to the @entity0 ’s new £ 1billion headquarters			2
however , they did not have to provide basic evidence of train fares or utility bills to back up their expense claims			2
the @entity0 's decision to pay generous allowances to persuade staff to move to the @entity27 in @entity3 has been criticised by the @entity8 the @entity0 spent a total of £ 150,000 on moving just one member of staff to @entity31			1
the generous ‘ relocation allowances ’ mean the total cost of moving @entity0 staff is to rise to more than twice the estimate of £ 11million			2
hundreds claimed up to £ 1,900 a month to cover all rent , bills and council tax in @entity3 , while others received £ 3,000 to buy new curtains and carpets			1
the influential @entity43 of @entity6 promised to investigate the corporation ’s financial affairs as it was revealed : @entity47 mp @entity46 , who sits on the @entity48 and sport select committee , said : ‘ this report shows what we already knew , which is that the move to @entity3 is a colossal waste of money			2
’ the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) report criticised the @entity0 for imposing ‘ inadequate ’ controls over its relocation payments to staff			1
it also said many aspects of the @entity0 ’s relocation package were ‘ unusual ’ and ‘ more generous than it normally offers ’			1
@entity63 was among the programmes to move from @entity65 to @entity31 staff who do not wish to move to @entity3 permanently can instead commute there – a 200 - mile journey from @entity65 – for two years and receive £ 1,900 a month to cover the cost of renting an apartment in the city			1
but they were not asked provide train tickets or utility bills to prove their expense claims			0
the @entity8 report said : ‘ the @entity0 did not apply a consistent approach to checking that relocating staff had actually incurred the costs that they were claiming			0
‘ the @entity0 did not ask staff to provide evidence that they owned a home and were therefore entitled to homeowners ’ allowances until after payments started			2
staff on the remote location allowance had to provide copies of their rental agreements or hotel bills but not receipts for train travel or utilities			0
’ @entity96 , head of @entity97 , said he thought the move to @entity3 was a ' positive ' step depending on what relocation package they chose , @entity0 staff were given a cash payment of £ 5,000 and 10 per cent of their salary as an ‘ incentive ’ to move			1
those who sold their homes and bought property in @entity3 were offered a financial guarantee meaning they would receive at least 85 per cent of the market value of their old home			0
but despite the already generous terms , many staff members were allowed to claim back more than the @entity0 ’s standard relocation policy normally allows			1
the @entity8 found these special exceptions ‘ had not been documented ’ while reasons for the decisions to grant them were ‘ unclear or missing ’			2
the @entity117 admitted that some of the lapses in financial control were ‘ unacceptable ’ but insisted all payments have since been audited , revealing ‘ no irregularities ’			0
@entity123 , chairman of the @entity117 ’s finance committee , said the @entity8 report found the total relocation cost of £ 224million was £ 9million under budget			0
@entity43 chairman @entity128 said her committee will travel to @entity3 next month for a special hearing into the @entity8 report			0
@entity96 said he was permanantly based in @entity3 and renting at his own expense			0
the move of @entity133 , @entity134 , children ’s programmes and @entity63 from @entity65 to @entity3 was initially suggested by @entity137 in 2004 when he was director general			1
he claimed he wanted to address concerns that the corporation was too ‘ @entity140 ’			0
the @entity0 has estimated its move to @entity3 could create an additional 15,000 jobs in the region through added spending			0
however it has directly recruited just 254 staff from @entity31 , including 39 from @entity3 .			0

more than *850* staff given thousands of pounds to move to the north
rent , utility bills , council tax , train fares and even curtains were *refunded*
@entity8 criticises ' exceptional ' and ' unusual ' payments
sport , children 's *tv* and @entity63 among programmes moved north
one person offered allowance to sell a second home , @entity8 found
still not clear if £ *233million* move will give value for money
the @entity0 made relocation payments of more than £ 100,000 to 11 staff including four payments of more than £ *140,000* .
every staff member was given £ 5,000 as a ‘ financial incentive ’ to make the move to @entity3 . they were also offered £ *350* to go on ‘ *familiarisation* visits ’ .
the head of the @entity0 ’s children ’s *service* , @entity181 , received a £ *17,000* ‘ allowance ’ so he could sell his second home in the east of @entity186 at a guaranteed price to *subsidise* his move north , while *keeping* his @entity65 home .
the @entity0 granted additional payments to *91* staff *exceeding* the standard relocation allowance but failed to justify or document the exceptions .
the director of @entity97 , @entity96 , has still not moved his family out of @entity65 despite being in charge of the *exodus* to @entity3 .
