they include one request @entity0 made five years ago and others pending since the summer of 2013			1
the lawsuit , filed in the @entity17 , comes a day after @entity18 broke her silence about her use of a private email account while secretary of state			1

the @entity0 filed a lawsuit wednesday against the @entity2 to force the release of email correspondence and government documents from @entity18 's tenure ' after careful deliberation and exhausting our other options , the @entity0 is taking the necessary legal steps to gain access to these important documents , which will shed light on actions by the @entity2 and former secretary clinton , a presumptive 2016 presidential candidate , during some of the most significant issues of our time , ' said @entity64 , @entity0 's general counsel			1
' the press is a proxy for the people , and @entity0 will continue its pursuit of vital information that 's in the public interest through this action and future open records requests , ' she said			2
@entity2 spokesman @entity73 declined to comment			0
he had previously cited the department 's heavy annual load of @entity11 requests — 19,000 last year — in saying that the department ' does its best to meet its @entity11 responsibilities			0
' he said the department takes requests ' first in , first out , ' but noted that timing depends on ' the complexity of the request			0
' @entity84 , a senior managing editor at @entity0 , said the news agency was planning to file additional requests under @entity11 following the disclosure last week that @entity18 used a private email account run on a server on her property outside @entity92 while working at the @entity2			1
@entity18 on tuesday said she sent and received about 60,000 emails from her personal email address in her four years as president @entity97 's secretary of state			1
she said roughly half were work - related , which she turned over to the @entity2 , while deleting tens of thousands more that were personal in nature			2
the department says it will take several months to review the material @entity18 turned over last year			0
once the review is complete , the department said , the emails will be posted online			0
the @entity0 had sought @entity18 - related correspondence before her use of a personal email account was publicly known , although wednesday 's court filing alleges that the @entity2 is responsible for including emails from that account in any public records request			1
' @entity2 's failure to ensure that secretary @entity18 's governmental emails were retained and preserved by the agency , and its failure timely to seek out and search those emails in response to @entity0 's requests , indicate at the very least that @entity2 has not engaged in the diligent , good - faith search that @entity11 requires , ' says @entity0 's legal filing			1
@entity0 is seekin materials related to her public and private calendars , correspondence involving longtime aides likely to play key roles in her expected campaign for president , and @entity18 - related emails about the @entity37 raid and @entity39 surveillance practices @entity18 is pictured here later on tuesday at the @entity137 20th anniversary of the @entity138			1
@entity18 said earlier in the day that she sent and received about 60,000 emails from her personal email address in her four years at @entity142 , roughly half were work - related , which she turned over to the @entity2 , while deleting tens of thousands more that were personal in nature specifically , @entity0 is seeking copies of @entity18 's full schedules and calendars from her four years as secretary of state ; documents related to her department 's decision to grant a special position to longtime aide @entity156 ; related correspondence from longtime advisers @entity159 and @entity160 , who , like @entity156 , are likely to play central roles in a @entity18 presidential campaign ; documents related to @entity18 's and the agency 's roles in the @entity37 raid and @entity39 surveillance practices ; and documents related to her role overseeing a major @entity172 contractor			1
the @entity0 made most of its requests in the summer of 2013 , although one was filed in march 2010			2
@entity0 is also seeking attorney 's fees related to the lawsuit			2
other organizations have also sued the @entity2 recently after lengthy delays responding to public record requests			0
in december , the conservative political advocacy group @entity181 sued the @entity2 for failing to disclose flight records showing who accompanied @entity18 on overseas trips			0
last week , the @entity185 , an organization that gathers declassified government records , filed a lawsuit after waiting more than seven years for the @entity2 to release of details of former secretary of state @entity190 's telephone conversations			2
@entity192 , director of the @entity185 , predicted the @entity2 would speed up its review facing legal action , particularly given that @entity18 has said that her email correspondence does n't include classified material			2
' when the government is under a court deadline , or really wants to review , they can whip through thousands of pages in a matter of weeks , which they should do here , ' @entity192 said			0
the @entity2 generally takes about 450 days to turn over records it considers to be part of complex requests under the @entity209			0
that is seven times longer than the @entity212 and @entity213 , and 30 times longer than the @entity214			0
an inspector general 's report in 2012 criticized the @entity2 's practices as ' inefficient and ineffective , ' citing a heavy workload , small staff and interagency problems .			0
