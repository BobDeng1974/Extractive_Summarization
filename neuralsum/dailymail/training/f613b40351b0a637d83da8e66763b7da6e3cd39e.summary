@entity0 was unwittingly growing cannabis in her garden after a rogue seed from a bird feed fell and started thriving it did n’t look out of place among the petunias in green - fingered grandmother @entity9 ’s front garden			1
the 5ft plant had plenty of foliage , pretty patterns on the leaves , and it seemed to thrive in a spot where others had perished			1
there was just one problem			0
it was a cannabis plant			1
and her unwitting cultivation of such a fine specimen brought the attention of the law after she had it identified by her local radio gardening programme			1
mrs @entity9 sent a picture of the mysterious plant to the @entity29 ’s appropriately named @entity28 , after suspecting all was not as it seemed			1
the show ’s resident experts immediately recognised it as cannabis – and the programme dutifully forwarded the photo to police			1
‘ oh dear , ’ mrs @entity9 was heard to say on air when told what she had produced			1
yesterday the 65 - year - old retired health visitor had chopped up the rogue plant and was preparing to dispose of it in accordance with police instructions			1
mrs @entity9 and her husband @entity44 , a 70 - year - old retired marine biologist , first noticed the plant in july in the front garden of their home in @entity49 , @entity50			1
‘ it popped up between my petunias , ’ mrs @entity9 said			1
‘ i just left it there and it grew and grew ... and grew			0
‘ it was quite useful because it filled a rather difficult space , but in a couple of months it was almost as tall as i am			0
it took root in a flower - bed less than 15ft from the pavement – in full view of passing pedestrians			2
none commented on what it might be ( ‘ and no one asked me to sell them any , ’ mrs @entity9 added )			1
but she did notice ‘ a sickly sweet pong ’ , and became suspicious			0
the grandmother of five posted a picture of it on @entity87 and invited friends to identify it			2
‘ they all said , “ no , no , it ’s not cannabis ” , and sent me the names of all sorts of plants they thought it could be			2
i wanted to be sure so i emailed a photo to the potting shed team			0
‘ i do n’t mind that they told the police – it actually put my mind at rest			0
they accepted that i was n’t intentionally cultivating it and said i would n’t be prosecuted if i destroyed it			0
‘ i did get an email asking if they could come and look in my loft though – but i live in a flat , and i have n’t got a loft			0
’ police confirmed that although an offence had been committed , there were mitigating circumstances , and no charges would be brought			2
mrs @entity9 said she had no idea the plant would be able to flourish in ' dear old @entity50 ' but had once seen it in @entity120 cannabis plants are usually grown indoors in the @entity122 with the help of fluorescent lamps and a controlled temperature gauge			1
but they can tolerate slightly harsher conditions and will thrive as long as they remain sheltered from the elements			2
the growing season in the @entity122 is rather short as cannabis is essentially a tropical plant			1
cannabis is induced to flower when the daylight has reduced to about 13 hours per day			2
this happens during september , but the plant has only six to 10 weeks flowering time before the first frost kills the plant			2
september and october can also be cold and wet , increasing the chances of fungus and disease ruining the crop			0
there are varieties bred especially for outdoor growing in @entity147 , but these tend to give poorer results than the best indoor or greenhouse types			0
the ideal grow site should get unrestricted sun for as much of the day as possible and protection from strong winds			0
with excellent growing conditions , @entity133 has been known to grow six inches a day , although the rate is more commonly one to two inches			0
the optimum temperature is @entity157 to @entity158 , so this is possible during the height of summer in the @entity122			0
under the advice of local police the plant has been removed and destroyed			0
mrs @entity9 will not be prosecuted the illegal plant had been growing in mrs @entity165 's well - kept garden at her home in @entity49 , @entity50			1

@entity9 was baffled by the plant growing in her garden
