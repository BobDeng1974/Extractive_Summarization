a narrow victory for the @entity92 in elections over the weekend in @entity43 means that the country is more likely to stick to the harsh austerity terms of its 240bn euro ( $ 300bn ) bailout package and avoid a chaotic exit from the euro in the very near future - an event many fear would destabilize @entity5 and send shockwaves through the world			2
