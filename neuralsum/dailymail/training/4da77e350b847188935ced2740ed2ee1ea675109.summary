@entity0 was last night facing demands to say if it has a copy of a missing dossier containing explosive claims of a @entity7 paedophile ring			0
campaigning mp @entity8 called on the @entity9 to reveal what information is in its hands after @entity13 was given the first indication that the bombshell file had been found			1
a @entity17 response about the documents – believed to name up to eight public figures involved in child sex abuse but lost or shredded by the @entity21 – confirmed ‘ the requested information is held ’ by @entity24 ’s biggest force			1
but the @entity0 has refused to set out exactly what information it has found – even though a fresh search is under way in @entity21 archives for the missing files compiled by the late @entity32 mp @entity31			1
@entity0 has refused to set out exactly what information it has found – even though a fresh search is under way in @entity21 archives for the missing files compiled by the late @entity32 mp @entity31 ( above ) last night @entity0 was told to come clean about what it has – or risk fresh accusations of a cover - up			1
mr @entity8 , the @entity40 mp for @entity41 who has helped uncover allegations of a @entity7 abuse scandal including the scale of offending by the late @entity46 , said : ‘ the @entity9 need to confirm or deny whether they hold what they believe to be the @entity31 dossier			2
i think they have a duty – not just to the @entity21 and the inquiry but to the public			2
‘ they have a responsibility to assist in terms of confirming whether the dossier exists or not			0
‘ it would be pretty appalling if they chose to hide the fact that they held the @entity31 dossier			0
‘ it could be that they failed to act on what ’s in the dossier and they are trying to keep a low profile in the hope it blows over			0
’ he made his demands after an @entity17 request by this newspaper gave the first hint that the @entity9 may have the sought - after dossier			2
the @entity75 asked this march for access to files on the investigations the @entity9 carried out into the notorious @entity79 and all the documents it received on the group and its members , including those sent by @entity31 , who died in 1995			0
last night @entity0 was told to come clean about what it has – or risk fresh accusations of a cover - up the @entity0 ’s @entity17 team replied in june , refusing to release the information in case it interfered with investigations , and to avoid revealing personal information			2
but within the five - page letter were several hints that the @entity9 had indeed found the documents compiled by @entity31			0
it stated : ‘ the searches located records relevant to your request … i have considered your request for information within the provisions set out by the @entity101 and can confirm that the requested information is held by the @entity103			1
‘ having located and considered the relevant information , i am afraid that i am not required by statute to release the information requested			0
i have applied this exemption in that the names and personal details of any living individuals identified in the reports constitute personal data which would , if released , be in breach of the rights provided by the @entity118			0
’ but a spokesman for the force said last night the admissions in the @entity17 response should not be taken as confirmation that the force did have the particular dossier given by @entity31 to the @entity21			1
he said : ‘ the @entity17 response makes it clear that records relevant to the request are held			1
however it does not indicate what those records are and it would be wrong to use that @entity17 response as confirmation that specific documents are held			1
’ the spokesman declined to answer specific questions on what documents it did have and when it had found them , and would only add : ‘ the @entity9 will fully co-operate with the review led by @entity140 and the panel chaired by @entity142 and provide detail of relevant information			2
‘ whilst these and live police investigations are ongoing , it would be inappropriate to comment on this further			0
’ @entity31 said on one occasion he had handed over ‘ eight names of big people , really important names ’ including a former friend of his			0
other files were said to expose ‘ paedophilia in @entity155 and the diplomatic and civil services ’ and a ‘ top television executive ’ as well as ‘ child abuse and sex assaults at a children ’s home ’ .			1
