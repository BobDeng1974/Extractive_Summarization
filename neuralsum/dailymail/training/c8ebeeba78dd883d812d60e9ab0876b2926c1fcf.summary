an 85 - year - old woman is fighting for her life in hospital after she was repeatedly stabbed and possibly raped in her own home , in @entity7 , @entity8 detective chief inspector @entity29 , who is leading the investigation , said officers were keen to find a man aged between 18 and 30 who was seen by a neighbour in the doorway of the woman ’s home at around 3.30pm			1
it is still unclear whether the incident was random or if the woman knew the attacker			2
she was alone in her home between 3pm and 4.30pm while her husband went out to the local shops , and officers are still working to pinpoint a time when the assault took place			1

they said officers were keen to find a man aged between 18 and 30 who was seen by a neighbour in the doorway of the woman 's home at around 3.30pm he said time of the reported sighting of the man in the doorway - 3.30pm - was a ' crucial time ' for officers			1
it is believed the attacker left via the back door of the property			0
' he was 18 to 30 years old , of average build with short dark hair			1
it was more of a glance what the witness got of him , because he was n’t doing anything particularly suspicious , ' said @entity48			0
' we are not ruling out whether it was random or targeted			0
i would certainly not discount the fact that the attacker has seen the husband leave the house and thought he was leaving an empty house , but at this stage in the inquiry it ’s crucial to keep an open mind			0
' officers remain certain that there was only one person responsible for the attack			1
@entity48 said : ' i would find it almost unfeasible for two people to be of a like mind to be prepared to do that to an elderly individual			0
' cabinets in the living room , which was at the rear of the house , were open , but it is not yet known whether anything was stolen as the property is still being examined for forensic evidence			0
@entity48 added : ' in my experience within the service i have never really heard of anything to this extent or its nature , a vicious attack and an attempt to take her life			2
' we are dealing with undoubtedly an attempted murder , there ’s a potential sexual element to it and we ca n’t rule out a theft			0
perhaps the lady has disturbed somebody carrying out a theft			0
at this stage we ca n’t rule anything out by way of a motive			0
' he urged anyone with information to come forward .			0
