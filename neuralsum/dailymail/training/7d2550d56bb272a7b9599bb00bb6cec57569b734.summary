the heavens are hosting an event this weekend that occurs once in a million years or so			2
a comet as hefty as a small mountain will pass mind - bogglingly close to @entity5 on sunday , approaching within 87,000 miles at a speed of 126,000 mph			1
@entity8 's five robotic explorers at @entity5 — three orbiters and two rovers — are being repurposed to witness a comet named @entity12 make its first known visit to the inner solar system			1
so are a @entity15 and an @entity17 spacecraft circling the red planet			2
scroll down for @entity19 once in any lifetime : this march 27 , 2014 image provided by @entity8 , @entity22 , and @entity23 shows comet @entity24 , also known as @entity12 , as captured by @entity25 on @entity8 's @entity26			1
( @entity27 photo / @entity8 , @entity22 , @entity23 ) the orbiting craft will attempt to observe the incoming iceball , then hide behind @entity5 for protection from potentially dangerous dusty debris in the comet tail			1
shielded by the @entity5 atmosphere , the @entity34 and @entity35 rovers may well have the best seats in the house , although a dust storm on @entity5 could obscure the view			1
' we certainly have fingers crossed for the first images of a comet from the surface of another world , ' said @entity8 program scientist @entity47			1
spacecraft farther afield , including the @entity26 , already are keeping a sharp lookout , as are ground observatories and research balloons			2
' we 're getting ready for a spectacular set of observations , ' said @entity53 , head of @entity8 's planetary science division			1
the orbiting craft will attempt to observe the incoming iceball , then hide behind @entity5 for protection named for the @entity57 observatory used to detect it in january 2013 , @entity12 will approach @entity5 from beneath and zoom right in front sunday afternoon , @entity60			1
on @entity61 , the best viewing , via binoculars or telescope , will be from the @entity65 — @entity66 and @entity57 will be in prime position			2
in the @entity69 , it will be difficult to see @entity12 slide by @entity5			1
the comet — with a nucleus estimated to be at least a half - mile in diameter — hails from the @entity74 on the extreme fringe of the solar system			2
it formed during the first million or two years of the solar system 's birth 4.6 billion years ago and , until now , ventured no closer to the sun than perhaps the orbits of @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 or @entity85			0
it comes around every one or more million years			0
it will be the first @entity74 comet to be studied up close in detail			0
for comparison , the flyby distance of 87,000 miles is about one - third of the way from here to the moon			0
@entity12 's tail could extend from @entity61 all the way to our moon			0
its gaseous coma , the fuzzy head surrounding the nucleus , might stretch halfway to the moon			0
@entity8 's five robotic explorers at @entity5 — three orbiters and two rovers — are being repurposed to witness a comet named @entity12 make its first known visit to the inner solar system no comet has come anywhere near this close to @entity61 in recorded history			1
' we ca n't get to an @entity74 comet with our current rockets ... so this comet is coming to us , ' said @entity115 , senior astrophysicist at @entity116 's applied physics laboratory			0
by studying @entity12 's composition and structure , scientists hope to learn more about how the planets formed , according to @entity115			0
scientists also are keen to spot any changes to the comet or @entity5 due to the close approach			1
@entity8 's newly arrived @entity128 spacecraft , for instance , will compare the upper atmosphere before and after it passes			1
' think about a comet that started its travel probably at the dawn of man and it 's just coming in close now , ' @entity115 said			0
' and the reason we can actually observe it is because we have built satellites and rovers			1
we 've now got outposts around @entity5			1
' scientists initially worried the spacecraft orbiting @entity5 would be at considerable risk from the comet 's massive trail of dust			1
the comet — with a nucleus estimated to be at least a half - mile in diameter — hails from the @entity74 on the extreme fringe of the solar system			0
the nucleus itself poses no danger of impact			0
but the particles in the tail , hurtling through space at 126,000 mph could fry electronics , puncture fuel lines , or destroy computers , transmitters or other vital spacecraft parts			1
as @entity12 's path became clearer , the threat level was deemed minimal			0
still , space agencies are taking no chances			0
they 're employing the ' duck and cover ' strategy			0
@entity8 's three orbiters — @entity171 , @entity172 and newcomer maven — will be behind the red planet at the time of peak danger			2
that 's a 20 - minute - or - so period approximately 1½ hours after the closest approach by the comet 's nucleus			0
the @entity22 also shifted the orbit of its @entity182 as did @entity17 for its @entity183 , or @entity183 , the country 's first interplanetary spacecraft that , like @entity8 's @entity128 , arrived last month			2
the precautions are prudent , said @entity188 senior research scientist @entity187 , who led a hazard - analysis team			0
' @entity190 are complex beasts and do n't always live up to our predictions , ' @entity187 said in an email wednesday			2
' if you do n't want surprises , then do n't study comets			0
' it will take at least a few days to obtain and analyze the best spacecraft data ; but images made from @entity61 should be forthcoming pretty quickly			0
@entity12 should pass closest to the sun six days after its @entity5 flyby , then swing back out , bidding goodbye , for at least another million years .			1

@entity190 is traveling at 126,000 mph and will pass the @entity5 on sunday
@entity8 is *diverting* its three @entity5 satellites and two rovers onto the ball of ice
