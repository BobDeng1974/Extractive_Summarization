this is the incredible moment a woodpecker was caught on camera giving a small weasel a lift on its back			1
the stunning photograph shows the tiny brown animal clinging to the back of the green woodpecker as it takes flight across @entity11 in east @entity12			1
although all appears rather amicable in the incredible image , amateur photographer @entity13 said the small mammal had actually pounced on the bird as its next victim			1
it was captured by photographer @entity13 , who had been enjoying a walk through the park with his wife although all appears rather amicable in the incredible image , mr @entity13 said the small mammal had actually pounced on the woodpecker as his next victim			1
however , instead of falling prey , the bird decided to take flight with the animal on its back and soared through the sky mr @entity13 , a project manager from @entity35 , managed to capture the action photo during a walk with his wife @entity38 yesterday			1
he later posted the photograph on @entity40 with the caption : ' took this picture earlier today			0
heard woodpecker in distress , then flew up with weasel on back			2
' the image has now gone viral online after thousands of users shared the ' one - in - a - million ' snap on social media			2
the 52 - year - old , who enjoys photography as a hobby , told @entity55 : ' we decided we fancied popping out yesterday afternoon and my wife has never seen a green woodpecker in the wild before and i knew of this place so we just went there for a walk			1
' we had been there for about 20 minutes , and had seen some other birds , when we heard this sort of distressed squawking			0
' out of the bushes flew a woodpecker so i said to my wife : " there 's a green woodpecker "			1
' it flew in front of us and we could see it through the trees			0
it was hopping around on the ground acting very , very strangely and still making this squawking noise			0
the small weasel could be seen clinging to the back of the woodpecker , with its arms wrapped around the bird 's body , as it took flight following a tumble in the grass of the @entity12 park , the green woodpecker managed to escape the small weasel who later ran off ' i decided to pick my camera up to have a look and just as i picked up the camera it flew off so i just started snapping at it as it came across in front of us			1
' it was at that point mr @entity13 said he noticed the small animal on the back of the bird and realised it was either a stoat or a weasel			1
he said : ' i said to my wife : " it has something on its back and i think it 's a stoat or weasel "			0
' the bird landed about 20 metres in front of us and i said to my wife that there 's a chance this weasel could eat the woodpecker			0
' but as we walked towards it , i think we distracted the weasel and the woodpecker flew off back into the bushes where it had originally come from			2
it initially settled down on the grass but then a few seconds later it flew off into the trees			0
mr @entity13 , 52 , ( pictured ) who enjoys photography as a hobby , said the response to the action photograph had been ' outstanding ' and ' absolutely mind - blowing ' ' we walked further up to where it had all happened and could n't see any sign of the weasel so i assume it had ran back off into the grass , hungry			1
' ' it looked as good as it could have considering it had just escaped being eaten by a weasel			0
' mr @entity13 , who has two grown - up daughters , said he only realised how remarkable his picture was when he downloaded it from his camera onto his computer			1
he said he had never taken a photograph quite like the one he captured of the woodpecker and said the response had been ' absolutely mind - blowing '			1
he added : ' i did get quite excited , i must admit			0
you look at it and your first reaction is " ooh i 've taken a picture " and then the second thought is " i 've taken a picture of a woodpecker with a weasel on its back "			2
' i think @entity38 was quite excited to see a woodpecker and see it in the context of being attacked by a weasel and then quite excited that my photograph has been seen by more than a million people			2
' i personally think i 've taken photos of better quality before , but they do n't have any drama in			0
i 've not taken anything like this before			0
' for over a million people to see your work is quite mind - blowing and outstanding			1
' mr @entity13 used his @entity167 camera and his 300m @entity169 lens to take the picture and usually just takes photos of wild birds at @entity174 bird reserve in @entity35			1
he added : ' i usually go there once a week and see lots of robins , chaffinches , blue tits , grey tits , coal tits and wetland birds			0
' the only weasel i had ever seen before this was when my wife were driving back from @entity12 and one ran across the road in front of us at @entity189			2
' @entity190 , a wildlife advisor for the @entity191 , said : ' these are an incredible set of images			0
' weasels are ferocious predators and often attack prey much larger than themselves			0
' in this case the weasel appears to have targeted the woodpecker due to the fact the green woodpeckers often spend a lot of on the ground eating ants so is very susceptible to attack			2
' if this had been a weaker bird i 'm sure the attack would have been successful but this woodpecker was strong enough to take flight with the weasel on his back			2
' it was pretty fortunate to escape			0
' @entity216 woodpeckers are relatively common but to see it in a mid-air battle like this is incredibly unusual			0
' this is truly a one - in - a - million shot			0
' mr @entity190 said he believed the weasel would have weighed about 190grams and been about 32cms long			0
mr @entity13 's image is much like the one taken by grandmother - of - four @entity223 , 70 , who spotted a frog clinging to the back of a goldfish in her garden pond in @entity229 , near @entity230 in @entity231 , in april last year			1
she took a photo of the incredible moment the amphibian hitched a ride from one side of the pond to the other ( pictured ) and said he had ' never seen anything like it before in her life ' from @entity242 to the ' weasel ' @entity244 : internet reacts to stunning action photo with series of hilarious memes the internet was awash with hilarious memes this afternoon following the emergence of @entity252 's incredible photograph			1
@entity253 posted one meme featuring @entity255 's @entity242 ( left ) while @entity256 posted one of @entity258 ( right ) on @entity40 fans were quick to replicate the photo and turn it into a meme with the addition of a famous face , including one featuring @entity264 in her infamous @entity266 get - up ( left ) and another of @entity268 's son @entity267 , crouching while topless on the small mammal and bird one meme by @entity273 / @entity272 replaced the weasel with @entity274 captain @entity244 ( left ) , while another by @ @entity275 superimposed @entity276 , from @entity277 , onto the back of the green woodpecker			1
the memes have been circulating on twitter one @entity40 account , @ sklueche , added @entity285 's @entity284 to the back of the small weasel ( left ) while @entity288 from @entity289 added one featuring @entity290 ( right ) another meme circulating online this afternoon featured a range of animals on top of the woodpecker including an elephant and a lion			2
