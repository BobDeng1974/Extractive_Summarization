by @entity1 reporter published : 05:49 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 06:11 est , 6 september 2012 most of us are only just getting used to seeing a little sunshine after a soaking summer			0
but one pub has decided to skip @entity6 and head for december by putting up its @entity9 tree 110 days early			1
and the @entity10 has already served its first festive meal			2
as many as 40 drinkers tucked into @entity9 lunch on august 26			1
jingle tills : the @entity10 has put up its @entity15 to attract @entity9 bookings			1
@entity17 is assistant manager at the business , in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the 39 - year - old said : ' it 's all to do with getting our bookings for @entity9 , to be fair			1
we like to get it up early to explain what we have got going on and get as many bookings as we can			2
' it 's going all right at the moment , we have got quite a few			0
' locals have been bemused by the addition to their bar			0
some have told staff : ' it 's way too early			2
' ' they think we are a bit mad to be honest			1
it is a bit early is n't it ? ' @entity17 said			1
' but all the @entity43 pubs should have their trees up , to be fair , to promote their @entity9 bookings			1
' i think most of the others will be putting theirs up shortly			0
we have to be first at everything			0
' @entity49 and his helper bring some festive cheer			0
two months before @entity52 night they wish it could be @entity9 every day ? drinkers enjoy the sunshine			1
and piles of crackers adorn a display on one side of the pub. kids have been pulling them			0
' we did have a @entity9 weekend a couple of weeks back , ' @entity17 said			1
' we had a @entity49 in and we did @entity9 dinners on the sunday			1
' that was sunday , august 26			1
we did two for £ 10			0
' it was turkey and all the trimmings , and all the @entity9 diners were out			2
but we did n't dress the tables , we just did the promotion			0
it was basically to give customers a taste of what the @entity9 dinners are like			1
' the pub is owned by the @entity77			0
spokesman @entity78 said : ' we are 50 per cent full even now , so it ’s a reminder to customers			2
' people have become more wary of spending money and they like to plan their spending ahead			0
the festive season is not too far away - even though the weather outside is tremendous			0
' when a customer realises it ’s just four more pay days until @entity9 it brings it home how close we are			2
' @entity90 stores have started stocking up for the festive season			0
at supermarket @entity90 , in @entity93 , in @entity92 , they have already started stacking the shelves with @entity9 goodies			2
branches of @entity98 have already set up dedicated @entity9 aisles across the nation			2
the first reports of @entity9 chocolate boxes on sale in @entity98 came on the august 29 when pictures appeared on @entity105			1
since then the @entity105 - sphere has been filled with angry posts about premature holiday season advertisements			0
clergyman @entity109 , a pastor in the @entity110 , claimed the true meaning of @entity9 had been hijacked by @entity112 said : ' it seems to get earlier each year and the emphasis has moved away from the birth of @entity115 to people trying to make as much money as possible			1
' the true significance of @entity9 has been lost			1
' people want to cash in on the festival but it ’s always been that way			0
however , i have been surprised to see how early advertising material and decorations have appeared this year			0

' its a reminder to customers , ' *brewery* *insists* about pub @entity131
first @entity9 dinner served to 40 customers on last sunday of august
drinkers think @entity19 pub is ' a bit mad ' for decorating so early
@entity141 ' true significance of @entity9 has been lost ' for businesses
