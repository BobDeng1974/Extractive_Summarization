@entity2 ’s @entity1 captain @entity0 cut a despondent figure on friday as he offered a downbeat assessment of his team of crocks			2
‘ we are dropping like flies , we really are , ’ he said			0
just over a month to the match at @entity10 , and it is looking like the @entity2 will need a hospital ward rather than a team room			1
@entity14 is definitely out as he tries to put his life back together			2
@entity18 , with his myriad of fitness issues , is a sad caricature of the player who ruled the world			0
preparing for a storm : @entity0 knows that his @entity2 team will be underdogs without so many of their stars hurting : the one - great champion admits his physical condition is nowhere near where it needs to be @entity29 ’s sad defence of the @entity30 ended painfully after just eight holes on thursday and he is adamant that he will not be seen anywhere near a golf course again until he sorts out two bulging discs in his neck			1
@entity37 @entity36 , the highest - rated @entity2 in the world rankings , is another who did not make the starting line - up at @entity41 because of a bad back			1
just to put the tin lid on matters , @entity45 , who has been selected as a vice-captain but could still make the team , judging by his fine play at this tournament , is fighting a sore hip			0
no defence : @entity52 quit his @entity30 defence after just eight holes down and out : @entity14 will also miss the @entity1 as he takes time away from the golf course indeed , the only man who looks fully fit is the captain himself , still sprightly at 64			1
for a proud man like @entity0 , of course , it is no laughing matter			0
‘ i ’ll be honest , it ’s anyone ’s guess who will be playing for us right now , ’ he said			0
the only certainty is that the beleaguered @entity2 will start as massive underdogs at the @entity69 course on september 26 to 28 .			2

@entity2 likely to be missing several major stars at @entity10 in september
@entity18 looks badly injured during @entity30
@entity14 and @entity52 both out of team with injuries
*top* - ranked @entity2 @entity36 also *doubtful* with back injury
