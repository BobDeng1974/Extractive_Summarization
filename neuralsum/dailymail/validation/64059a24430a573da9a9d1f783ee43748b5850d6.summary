@entity0 has revealed that @entity2 's ' mr @entity1 ' is intent on releasing a month 's worth of pent up frustration when @entity5 visit @entity6 on saturday			1
@entity7 was knocked unconscious against @entity8 on february 14 and was forced to sit out the defeat by @entity10 after suffering a setback in the return to play protocols for concussion			1
now restored to full fitness , @entity7 returns for @entity2 's tilt at reviving their @entity18 title challenge and @entity0 will be only too pleased to hear the fiery full - back barking orders once again			1
@entity7 wants to let out all his frustration when he returns to face @entity5 according to @entity0 ' it 's always good having an angry man behind you , shouting and doing his thing			1
he 's an exciting player , ' @entity0 said			2
' he 's constantly on us and is a good leader			2
he 's been itching to get himself right and back out there , just to release some of his anger			2
off the pitch he 's just as angry			0
he 's just always angry			0
' @entity2 missed the comfort blanket @entity7 provides at full - back as their @entity34 quest ground to a halt in @entity36 in a result that has seen @entity10 reinstated as title favourites			1
@entity0 ( centre ) is looking forward to having ' mr @entity40 ' back for their crucial @entity18 clash among the combinations that took a step backwards at the @entity45 was the centre partnership of @entity0 and @entity47 , who disappointed after encouraging outings against @entity49 and @entity8			1
the centre duo were hardly alone in underperforming amid an inexplicably subdued @entity2 display , but with only five games remaining until the @entity53 - three of them warm up matches for the tournament - opportunities to reassert themselves are running out			2
@entity47 excelled against @entity49 and @entity8 , forcing @entity0 to take a back seat , and the inside centre 's place in the team was under threat until @entity61 was ruled out against @entity5 by a sprained ankle			1
the full back has been an ever - present for @entity65 's side and his loss was a real miss for the squad @entity7 ( 15 ) was knocked unconscious against @entity8 and did n't feature in @entity2 's defeat in @entity10 @entity0 , who has shaken off a calf problem to retain his place in the starting xv , points out that he has taken a selfless approach as his understanding with @entity47 grows			1
' it 's always nice scoring tries , but it 's just as nice getting the applause from @entity47 and others for creating that space and doing the hard graft that some people might not pick up on , ' he said ' on and off the field we have a good relationship			0
we get on really well			0
we had last weekend off but we 've still been speaking to each other			0
' it 's good to have that relationship because we have a group that has got each other 's backs and look out for each other			0
@entity47 ( left ) has arguably been @entity2 's most impressive player in the tournament ' it 's important that i create that space for @entity47 to do his thing , which is obviously something we 've seen already in this @entity18			1
given a bit of space , he can be electric in that 13 channel			0
' and vice versa if i want the ball in my hands early from him , he now knows to do that			0
' we 've worked hard on it in training and while we 're still building in these early stages , we 're happy with how each other 's roles are			0
' @entity2 's final training session on wednesday afternoon in preparation for the penultimate round of the @entity18 was full - blooded , releasing the angst that had built up after the no - show against @entity10			1
@entity65 took charge of a full bloodied training session at @entity119 on wednesday head coach @entity65 was forced to blow the whistle early , fearing the consequences as the intensity of the exchanges between the @entity124 at the squad 's @entity119 training camp escalated			0
' with a session like that it sets us up nicely for the weekend			0
it 's about trying to replicate that intensity of test match rugby , ' @entity0 said			2
' it gets a bit feisty at times which is always good and healthy because that shows people care and want the shirt			0
' @entity2 still have a chance of winning the @entity18 but know they ca n't afford to slip up			1

@entity0 said @entity7 is ready to release hell on @entity5
' mr @entity1 ' is set to return for @entity2 's @entity18 clash at @entity6
@entity0 will also retain his place after *recovering* from a calf *injury*
