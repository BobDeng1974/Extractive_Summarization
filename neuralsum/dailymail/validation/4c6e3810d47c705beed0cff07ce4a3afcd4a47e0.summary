@entity0 shrugged off the fierce speculation over his future by snatching an injury - time winner for @entity4 at @entity5			1
this derby was drifting towards a goalless draw when @entity8 sent over a corner with 15 seconds remaining of the four added minutes			0
@entity10 flicked on and @entity0 stuck out a boot to score his 14th goal of the season from close range			2
it was an amazing finish after 48 hours of questions about the possibility of the striker leaving @entity4			2

booked : @entity50 , @entity53 , @entity46 @entity62 man : @entity8 referee : @entity64 7 attendance : 15,362 @entity66 have offered to take @entity0 to the @entity67 on loan for the rest of the season with a view to signing him permanently for a fee of £ 8million , potentially rising to £ 10m			1
their championship promotion rivals @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 have also registered an interest in @entity4 ’s record £ 8m signing who still has four - and - a - half years left on his contract at @entity5			1
but having rejected a £ 12m offer from @entity86 last summer , @entity4 ’s owners @entity83 ’s are reluctant to sell while their club still have an outside chance of reaching the playoffs following this win , as well as the prospect of a @entity93 quarter - final replay with @entity94 next month			1
asked if he has been given assurances that @entity0 will not be sold , manager @entity101 replied : ‘ yes , it just would n’t add up			2
why would you loan out your top goalscorer ? my five - year - old nephew might be able to work that one out			1
‘ i ca n’t answer on behalf of @entity66 but @entity0 has just scored the winner and he will be starting at @entity104 on saturday			1
‘ he just handles the speculation enormously well			0
i was quietly confident of him scoring tonight , to be perfectly honest , because that ’s what he does when there ’s all the talk			0
’ @entity101 described this as @entity4 ’s best win of the season after the physical and mental energy his players exerted in sunday ’s goalless draw with @entity94 at @entity117			2
they lost @entity33 and @entity30 to injury in the first - half but @entity35 should have put them ahead in stoppage time when he headed over from @entity124 ’s cross			0
substitute @entity54 wasted @entity20 ’s best chance when he raced clear only to shoot straight at @entity27 , and @entity0 should have scored with a 79th - minute header from close - range before making amends at the death			1
conceding another yet another late goal was a sickener for @entity20 who are still not free of relegation danger			2

‘ that ’s five games in the last month and it ’s cost us seven points			0
we ’d be home and hosed but we still have a bit of work to do			0
‘ if we ca n’t defend a set - piece in the last 30 seconds of the game … the players are n’t learning so we ’ve got some work to do to make them mentally stronger because it ’s obviously a psychological thing			0
‘ you think it ca n’t happen again then lo and behold it does			0
i ’m lost for words			0

@entity0 has been strongly linked with a move away from @entity4
he scored in the 90th minute to give @entity4 *victory* over @entity20
the *25* - year - old signed for @entity4 for £ 8million in 2012
