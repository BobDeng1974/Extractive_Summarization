by @entity0 @entity2 ’s hopes of rescuing their season with @entity5 glory were dealt a hammer blow when @entity7 was ruled out of both legs of the quarter - final with @entity10			1
the striker , whose hat - trick against @entity13 on wednesday set up the tie with the @entity16 champions , will be out for up to six weeks — meaning he may not be fit until @entity2 ’s final @entity18 game on may 11			1
after a day of tests on the injury he suffered near the end of the @entity13 game , @entity2 ’s medical staff confirmed that @entity25 had a strained knee			2
unhappy ending : @entity7 was carried off on a stretcher after scoring three against @entity13 concern : @entity29 looked worried about his strike partner when he went down on wednesday blow : the injury has ruled @entity25 out of playing in crucial games for @entity2 mar 23 : @entity34 ( a ) mar 25 : @entity35 ( @entity36 ) mar 29 : @entity37 ( @entity36 ) apr 1 : @entity10 ( @entity36 ) apr 5 : @entity38 ( a ) apr 9 : @entity10 ( a ) apr 20 : @entity39 ( a ) apr 26 : @entity40 ( @entity36 ) at one time there were even fears in @entity43 that the 30 - year - old ’s problem might be serious enough to rule him out of the @entity46			1
the diagnosis was good news for the @entity49 , but was a huge blow for @entity2 and their manager @entity51 as he looks to revive a season which looks increasingly likely to end with the club failing to qualify for the @entity5 for the first time in 19 years			2
@entity2 play @entity10 at home on april 1 , then travel to @entity56 eight days later			0
that gives @entity25 no chance of taking part			0
@entity10 have knocked @entity2 out of the competition twice since sir @entity62 ’s side famously beat them with two late goals to win the @entity5 final in 1999 , and will be firm favourites when they meet next month			0
however , @entity51 , fresh from another meeting with chief executive @entity67 to discuss his summer transfer targets , has watched @entity10 several times this season and believes that he has spotted weaknesses @entity2 can exploit			0
