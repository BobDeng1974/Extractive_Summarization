a parliamentary pass gives the holder full access to the high - security @entity38 estate			1
they are given to mps , aides , journalists and staff who work in the @entity44			0
passes – which are granted only after a full security check – are prized because they allow the holder to wander unaccompanied around the estate and gain access to mps and officials , as well as restaurants and bars in @entity38			2
mr @entity13 , @entity14 mp for @entity54 , has written to the speaker to ‘ raise the concerns of several of my constituents ’			1
mr @entity13 adds : ‘ integrity , accountability and openness , are part of the seven @entity62 which are enshrined into @entity16 by their inclusion in @entity64 for mps			2
’ he sets out several questions , including why mrs @entity8 was given a parliamentary pass , what kind of pass it was when it was issued and when expires			1
the letter asks what was ‘ the intended purpose of her company ’s donation to your office and whether mr @entity3 consulted with ‘ with any of the parliamentary authorities , such as your foremost adviser , the clerk of the @entity44 , on the propriety of accepting a donation having issued this pass ’			1
