by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was forced to apologise to @entity3 on friday night when lawyers decided that the managing director had breached the confidentiality agreement reached when @entity7 sacked their maverick star			1
@entity2 had provided the most detailed and welcome explanation yet behind the decision to sever ties with @entity3 after the @entity13 disaster in an interview last week with @entity15 on @entity17 ’s @entity16			1
hitting back : @entity3 rejected @entity2 's claims made on @entity16 hitting out : @entity3 was criticised for his ' irresponsible ' batting style during the @entity13 series in @entity21 yet his claims that @entity3 was ‘ disinterested ’ and ‘ distracted ’ during the @entity26 in january and that all senior players and management agreed with the sacking incurred the wrath of the player and his lawyers who have been engaged in talks with the @entity32 ’s legal team over the last week			1
those talks ended with @entity2 issuing an apology for talking about the matter but not for what he said			1
it is another blow to the @entity32 , who have been outmanoeuvred by @entity3 in the @entity40 stakes despite having justifiable reasons for the sacking			1
it will also be frustrating for senior players and coaches who want the full story made public as soon as possible			2
and the fact that @entity3 has regularly appeared to breach the confidentiality agreement himself through comments made via his voluble mouthpiece @entity51 does not seem to have been taken into account			2
what is clear is that both sides should have been allowed to have their say at the time , rather than leaving frustrated supporters in the dark			0
tough talking : @entity32 managing director @entity2 ( left ) and @entity17 test match special commentator @entity15 ( right ) outcast : @entity7 coach @entity59 could not find any support among senior players for @entity3 meanwhile , after the twin imposters of @entity64 disaster and @entity66 triumph , @entity7 will go in search of consistency at @entity69 on saturday when they look to clinch a one - day series that would provide a significant boost for them			1
three one - sided matches in the @entity75 series see @entity7 2 - 1 up with two to play and determined to repeat the positive cricket which saw them recover from being skittled for 99 in the @entity78 to blast @entity79 out for 67 under @entity81 ’s leaden skies on wednesday			2
the sun may finally shine on the tourists at @entity84 ’s today which could provide a more level playing field and a test of the methods which @entity7 insist they will employ all the way to the @entity90 next february in 50 - over cricket			0
‘ we ’ve tried to learn from what has gone on and we want to produce the brand of cricket we saw at @entity66 again and again now , ’ said spinner @entity92			0
‘ that ’s the focus			0
there ’s not a lot of time left until the @entity90 and , win or lose , we want to do the things that we think will stand us in good stead in that tournament			0
’ @entity7 have seemed a seamer short in these recent matches , although that problem should be addressed when @entity106 and @entity107 return to the one - day side			0
for now , though , captain @entity109 must find 20 overs from a combination of @entity92 , @entity112 and @entity113 to supplement his three main bowlers .			0
