by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 13:03 est , 2 october 2012 it may be the most dangerous thing that has ever come out of @entity3			0
a beast so powerful that just a tiny nibble off the end will make your eyes water			0
introducing the @entity10 , the @entity12 's hottest commercially grown chilli pepper , now to be found on supermarket shelves around the country ... complete with a warning not to handle with bare hands			1
have a bite : @entity3 farmer @entity18 with his powerful @entity10 , now available at @entity19			1
@entity18 , a @entity3 farmer who produces an astonishing 500,000 mouth - scorching chilli peppers every week , has unleashed the hell - raising @entity10 , his most powerful variety of chilli yet , and it will be sold exclusively by @entity19			1
a chilli pepper 's heat is measured in @entity25 , and last year the 40 - year - old farmer produced his notorious @entity27 , a pepper of just over one million scovilles that the @entity30 has described as 400 times hotter than @entity31			1
@entity18 's brand new wrinkly little red devil , the @entity10 , climbs the ladder of heat to an almighty 1.12 million @entity35			0
the @entity27 's @entity19 packaging is emblazoned with a six chilli icon warning and labels reading ' @entity39 ' , ' the hottest ' and , in full block capital letters : ' warning ! do not touch without gloves			1
wash hands thoroughly after preparation to avoid irritation			0
' go on , give it a nibble : mr @entity18 's @entity10 measures 1.12 million scoville units on the official chilli heat @entity53			2
inside the packet the guidelines read : ' use with caution			0
ideally used in @entity59 dishes , its scorching heat combined with a distinctive fruity aroma makes it the chilli of choice for cooks wanting a new experience			2
' ouch : the new @entity68 comes with a warning not to handle with bare hands			1
@entity19 chilli buyer @entity71 said : ' chilli fans will love the @entity68 as it has a wonderful fruity flavour to match its searing heat level			1
' the heat builds slowly allowing you to savour the full flavour			0
it 's very deceptive because it takes a good 30 seconds for the heat to really start working and then it continues to build for a few minutes			0
' it 's definitely not for the faint - hearted and should be tasted with extreme caution			1
' farming has been in mr @entity18 's family since 1972 when his father began growing cucumbers			0
but 15 years ago the younger @entity18 decided to tap in to the @entity12 's new - found hunger for hot chillies , those little firecrackers which were becoming increasingly popular and which are now sold at the rate of 45 million per year			2
he said : ' until then , generally all the chillies sold in the @entity12 were imported , mainly from @entity91 or the @entity92			0
' there was probably a reluctance from @entity12 growers to risk branching out into what was an extremely niche market , but demand has really grown in the last five years and i now produce up to half a million hot chilli peppers a week during the five month season			2
' in the last two years we 've doubled production of our hottest chilli peppers and i 've calculated that one of my chilli peppers reaches one in 200 people in the @entity12 each week			1
' scorching : the hottest chilli peppers - such as bird 's eye , scotch bonnet , @entity27 and habanero - are now sold in the @entity12 at a rate of 45 million per year			1
while chilli pepper culture is rapidly becoming more popular throughout the @entity12 , it 's the fiercest ones such as @entity27 , scotch bonnet , habanero and bird 's eye that are growing the fastest			0
mr @entity71 added : ' chilli pepper culture in the @entity12 has really come on in the last few years and chilliese are no longer thought of as a culinary novelty			0
' the @entity68 costs 90p for a 15g packet .			2
