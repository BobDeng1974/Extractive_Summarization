if you were feeling lucky pre-season , then you may have waltzed into your local bookmakers , seen @entity3 priced at 6/1 to be relegated , and thought : ' why not ? ' they 'd just been stripped of @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			2
@entity10 , their chairman , had resigned			0
their manager , @entity12 , had abandoned @entity14 's in favour of a more likely @entity17 candidate in north @entity18			2
yet your ill - wagered stake has been lost			2
for @entity3 have passed the 40 - point mark – the yardstick for @entity23 survival – with 16 games to spare			1
@entity25 celebrates with his manager @entity26 during @entity3 's win at @entity28 @entity25 ( left ) ran straight to @entity3 manager @entity26 to share in the moment of his first goal for the club @entity3 have defied the odds this season to remain in contention for a top - four finish @entity36 ( left ) faced @entity37 four years ago four years ago , @entity3 lost 2 - 0 against @entity37 in @entity38 at @entity39 ... with @entity9 , @entity36 ( pictured ) , @entity40 and @entity41 involved the @entity42 beckons , and it is hardly a case of your awkward cousin crashing the party			1
they ’ve earned their invite to be among the pack chasing @entity17 football			2
@entity51 , from 2007 , were the focal point of a documentary by @entity54 called @entity55			1
the plot was to chronicle the debt - ridden club ’s leap from the @entity60 to the @entity23 , from @entity61 to @entity62			1
the west @entity63 did it , under the tutelage of @entity68 magnates @entity66 and @entity69 , and fellow tycoons @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
@entity3 may not have had a fly on the wall but they ’ve done it , too			2
this weekend marks four years since @entity3 , scrapping in @entity38 , lost 2 - 0 against @entity37 , the @entity77 club now loitering some 88 positions below in the basement division			1
a certain @entity40 , @entity9 , @entity36 and @entity41 played that day on january 22 to the tune of a 5,504 attendance			0
@entity36 is used to marking those such as @entity84 's @entity83 these days in the @entity23 @entity41 ( top ) has gone from facing @entity37 in 2011 to @entity86 in 2015 @entity3 , @entity26 @entity86 , @entity87 @entity84 , @entity88 @entity89 , @entity12 @entity90 , @entity91 @entity92 , @entity93 the latter two remain at @entity3 , while @entity37 face dropping out of the @entity96 altogether this year			1
there 's something sentimental about going from @entity37 ’s @entity39 and the like to knocking on the door of @entity101 ’s @entity100 , @entity103 ’s @entity102 , and @entity105 ’s @entity104 , among others			1
what football supporter has n’t dreamed of that ? @entity92 , following a five - year absence from the @entity42 , were cordially invited to the @entity100 in @entity110 on november 4 , yet fielded a weakened team			1
were @entity3 given the chance ... you know the rest			2
yet 16 games are to be played between now and may 24 , when they travel to the @entity117 to play reigning champions @entity118			0
that finale perhaps the ultimate test of their @entity42 credentials			0
@entity92 fielded a weakened side against @entity101 at the @entity100 this season ... would @entity3 ? @entity93 ' men got back into the @entity42 after a five - year absence but fielded a b team it is 10 years since @entity128 reached the @entity42 only to lose in the qualifying rounds the @entity23 , you see , is a tight - knit group			1
its status quo is rarely interrupted , as shown above			0
in the past five years just six different teams have broken into the top four – those being @entity135 , @entity84 , @entity89 , @entity92 and the two @entity137 clubs			1
@entity128 are the seventh club , if you stretch back a decade , though they lost in the qualifying rounds			0
compare that to @entity142 ’s top divisions since 2009 – @entity150 ’s @entity149 ( 9 ) , @entity148 ’s @entity147 ( 7 ) , @entity144 ’s @entity143 ( 9 ) and @entity146 ’s @entity145 ( 9 ) – and the @entity23 ( 6 ) proves the most difficult to crack			1
all this , shown below			0
@entity152 stunned @entity142 by reaching the @entity42 final in @entity154 last season @entity152 also beat giants @entity103 and @entity101 to the @entity149 crown in an extraordinary season @entity3 , it is well documented , traded their prized possessions for £ 94.5million during the summer ’s transfer window			2
they made a mockery of the suggestion they would not cope without @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity164 , @entity9 ( and @entity10 and @entity12 )			0
to think it was on december 20 , 2014 , when @entity3 had @entity128 , @entity166 , @entity135 , @entity84 , @entity86 and @entity28 ahead			2
it was the run that should unmask the pretenders , that would surely end all this silly nonsense			0
they have taken 16 points since beating @entity128 3 - 0 , the finest form in the @entity23			1
@entity92 – the club that exchanged £ 49m for @entity7 , @entity6 and @entity9 – are behind with 14 points from their previous six			1
then , @entity84 , @entity135 and @entity89 ( 13 )			0
@entity3 – @entity176 ( 16 points ) @entity92 – @entity178 ( 14 ) @entity84 – @entity179 ( 13 ) @entity135 – @entity180 ( 13 ) @entity89 – @entity181 ( 13 ) @entity118 – @entity182 ( 11 ) @entity183 – @entity184 ( 10 ) @entity86 – @entity185 ( 9 ) @entity186 has been an integral part of @entity3 's watertight defence this season @entity25 ( left ) gave @entity3 the lead against @entity28 as they continue their quest for @entity17 football dec 20 , @entity3 3 - 0 @entity128 dec 26 , @entity166 1 - 3 @entity3 dec 28 , @entity3 1 - 1 @entity135 jan 1 , @entity3 2 - 0 @entity84 jan 11 , @entity192 0 - 1 @entity3 jan 17 , @entity28 1 - 2 @entity3 feb 1 , @entity3 vs @entity193 feb 7 , @entity51 vs @entity3 feb 11 , @entity3 vs @entity90 feb 22 , @entity3 vs @entity92 feb 28 , @entity194 vs @entity3 mar 3 , @entity3 vs @entity166 given their fixtures since before @entity197 , you can only ask a ) how many points did @entity3 expect to get from those six matches ? and b ) how many points do they expect to get from their next six ? @entity193 , @entity51 , @entity90 , @entity92 , @entity194 and @entity166 to come			1
maximum 18 ? settle for another 16 ? fifteen perhaps ? @entity3 's defence will have a say in that			1
in the @entity23 , they ’ve conceded the least goals ( 16 ) , giving them the best average ( 0.73 ) , and have made more tackles ( 512 ) than any other club			1
at the other end , they ’ve scored the fourth most goals ( 37 ) , and have had the fifth most shots ( 220 ) , not including those blocked			0
their percentage of goals to shots ( 16.82 ) is the third best in the @entity23			2
@entity3 pulled off a stunning 1 - 0 victory at @entity217 earlier this month to shock @entity86 @entity86 have struggled under @entity218 , unlike @entity3 under countryman @entity26 @entity219 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) went head to head but the @entity3 manager won in the away fixture did you hear the one about the @entity225 ? no , not a joke			1
it is @entity26 and @entity87 , the @entity3 and @entity86 managers respectively , that occupy the coveted third and fourth positions			1
they are far from friends , despite being compatriots , yet made headlines for differing reasons during their first month in charge , namely because one brought in £ 94.5m while the other spent £ 153m			0
@entity219 has been questioned about his formations , tactics , substitutions , and the like			0
why , for example , was @entity241 taking corners ? why was @entity243 being used as a striker ? why will you not give up on 3 - 5 - 2 ? he ’s playing all the right notes , just not necessarily in the right order – as the late , great @entity249 might say			2
@entity3 are aiming to qualify for the @entity42 this year in the @entity23 @entity26 replaced @entity12 last summer and has taken the club to new heights @entity26 , on the other hand , has cracked it			1
he orchestrated a win over @entity86 at @entity217			0
then , another over @entity28 at @entity255 , and had the gall to suggest the three points in the @entity258 felt even sweeter			0
there are no delusions of grandeur			0
while we ’d all love to see @entity91 , trench coat et al , command @entity90 at the @entity100 , it would be stirring to see a team that just four years ago were in @entity38 earn their right to be in @entity142 next year			1
it would prove @entity42 qualification in @entity273 is not reserved for those prepared to break the bank			0
not just a rich boys club , after all			0
we ’ll know for certain come may 24			0
if @entity3 can continue their unprecedented rise , then they could be coming to a @entity42 evening near you			2
@entity9 ( left ) , @entity6 ( centre ) and @entity7 ( right ) left for @entity92 during the summer @entity5 ( left ) joined @entity86 while @entity8 ( right ) moved to @entity84 in the summer			0

@entity51 *starred* in @entity55 documentary which recorded their rise in 2007 from the @entity60 to the @entity23
this weekend marks four years since @entity3 lost 2 - 0 against @entity37 in @entity38 at @entity39
@entity3 are now knocking on the door of @entity17 trips to the @entity100 , @entity102 , @entity289 , @entity104 and more
@entity26 ’s team have the best defence in the @entity23 , having conceded the least ( 16 ) and made the most tackles ( 512 )

@entity3 currently have the best form in the @entity23 in the last six matches ( @entity176 ) with 16 points , ahead of @entity92 on 14 points
