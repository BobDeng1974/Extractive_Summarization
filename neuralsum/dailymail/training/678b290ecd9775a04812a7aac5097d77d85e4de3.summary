to say @entity1 ’s presence will loom large as @entity2 try to win the @entity3 for the first time since 1986 does not go far enough			1
his face will be in the @entity7 dressing room before kick - off and on the pitch too			0
so fond is @entity10 of @entity1 , and body art for that matter , he has a tattoo of the national icon heading a ball inked on to his hip			1
it is a startling tribute to a player @entity10 has himself been compared with			1
@entity19 does not hold the patent on such matters			0
but were the @entity36 star to have another match of minimal impact , as against @entity39 in the semi-final , then others will need to step up to beat @entity42			2
@entity10 could be that man			1
he is another stocky forward of skill and speed , and earned that @entity1 comparison by becoming a hero at @entity47			1
those fans adored him as one third of a triumvirate with @entity51 and @entity52 as @entity47 challenged for @entity53 and won @entity54			0
there is a rock ’ n ’ roll edge to his personality that echoes @entity1 , demonstrated by several tattoos , including an evil clown on his shoulder and a handcuffed pocket - watch on his back , alongside portraits of @entity65 and the @entity66 ( his @entity68 name means ‘ @entity69 strengthens ’ )			2
hero : @entity1 lifts the @entity3 in 1986 after being the star of the tournament passion : @entity10 celebrates with team - mates after @entity2 beat @entity75 after a @entity77 game against @entity78 in 2011 , @entity10 was seen with @entity79 opening a bottle of beer with his teeth and he once said : ‘ if i have a chance to party then i will , no problem			1
’ rather than @entity1 , @entity10 would reference a likeness to @entity86 , sharing a dogged personality fused with nimbleness , vision and bursts of pace			1
those are the attributes @entity10 has brought to this @entity3 with his influence growing as the tournament has progressed			2
coming on as a late substitute against @entity96 he passed to @entity19 then darted into the area , creating just enough uncertainty for @entity19 to curl in a superb winner			0
injuries to @entity101 and @entity79 have promoted @entity10 to starting roles and against @entity39 he was one of the better players , bustling into space and linking play , albeit unable to conjure a moment of magic			1
devoted : @entity10 has a tattoo of his hero @entity1 on the side of his body stars : both @entity19 ( foreground ) and @entity10 ( background ) have been nominated for the @entity116 award at 29 , he has reached the pinnacle of his career , winning two @entity120 titles after moving to @entity121 for € 30million			1
he holds his own in a team including @entity124			0
and yet at 17 he gave up the game , frustrated in the lower levels of @entity2 , and spent 18 months out as an apprentice electrician			2
@entity128 offered him a way back then , and @entity130 are reported to be interested now — little wonder after he has twice pulled them apart in the @entity77			0
in 2012 he scored a brace in @entity133 and this year once in @entity134			0
he has suffered heartache away from football too			0
in february he celebrated a goal by pointing to the skies days after his uncle @entity139 , his first coach , had been shot dead in @entity140			0
humour remains though , and he was caught on camera squirting water over @entity2 manager @entity143 during the @entity3 group stage clash with @entity145			2
others managers might have hooked him on the spot , but @entity143 is more relaxed , which is useful when there is a @entity3 to be won and @entity10 could provide the spark to seal it .			0

@entity10 has the chance to evoke *memories* of @entity1 in 1986
the @entity121 man has a tattoo of the @entity2 *legend*
injuries to @entity101 and @entity79 promoted @entity10 to a starting role against @entity39
@entity10 is another stocky forward like @entity1 of skill and speed
