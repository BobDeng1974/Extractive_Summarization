by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 14 december 2012 @entity1 has really got my goat today			2
what does a 53 - year - old male , over-rated @entity4 pop star know about morning sickness ? how dare he say that , ' @entity9 was in the hospital , as far as i could see , for absolutely no reason '			1
the @entity15 ' frontman @entity1 , left , said no blame had been placed the @entity9 , right , for the death of nurse @entity18 , an accusation @entity0 finds ' despicable ' does he not believe that feeling constantly nauseous and being unable to hold down food or water is quite bad for your health ? has he got a medical degree that we are unaware of and does he dispute that such a condition as hyperemesis gravidarum exists ? perhaps he 'd like to try enduring chronic flu - like conditions - i imagine this pampered pop star would be calling the emergency services before you know it			1
even more shockingly , he appears to be trying to blame @entity9 for the death of nurse @entity18 , who put the hoax call through at the hospital where @entity9 was receiving treatment			1
prince @entity38 and his pregnant wife @entity9 , the @entity9 , leave the king edward vii hospital on 6 december poor @entity9 is in the fragile early stages of pregnancy and was forced to announce it when she fell ill and felt there would be too much speculation if she remained silent , she does n't need idiots like @entity1 wading in with accusations that are likely to raise her stress levels even further			1
let 's not forget that this is man who has form for piddling on people 's bonfires			2
earlier this year , while we were all caught up in @entity57 pride and joy , he slammed the â€˜ blustering jingoism ' of @entity60 and even compared the support of athletes to @entity63 in the late 1930s			2
the @entity65 - born star said , ' i am unable to watch the @entity57 due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event			0
the spirit of 1939 @entity63 now pervades throughout media - brand @entity70			0
' @entity72 , the widower of nurse @entity18 - who was involved in a hoax call concerning the @entity9 at @entity39 - wiith their children @entity78 , 14 , and @entity79 , 17 clearly the man has a very warped perception of the world			1
but it also smacks of a desperate clamoring for headlines , a conscious decision to court controversy			0
i am faintly proud that i have disliked him and his faux whacky , attention - grabbing efforts since his @entity4 heyday			0
when i was about eight years old i saw him dancing around the @entity93 stage with plants sticking out of his trousers - i immediately dismissed him as weirdo who was n't worth listening to			0
i only hope that @entity9 can take a similar attitude			1
