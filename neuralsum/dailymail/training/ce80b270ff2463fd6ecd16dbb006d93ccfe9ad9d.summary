by @entity0 published : 15:33 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 17:40 est , 26 november 2013 buyers paid up to $ 17 million for canvases said to have been created modernist painters such as @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
but it now appears that most , if not all of the 63 works of art ( which fetched almost $ 80 million in sales ) were nothing more than fakes and painted in a garage in @entity17 , @entity18			1
' thief ' : @entity20 is accused raking in more than $ 33million by selling phoney artwork to @entity18 galleries gallery president : @entity24 sold 40 works of art for @entity27 thinking they were masterpieces when they were in fact fake			1
the gallery raked in $ 63 million authentic : this is what a @entity32 painting looks like the paintings were instead created by an artist ( 73 - year - old @entity38 - @entity37 painter @entity36 , ) who was paid a few thousand dollars each to create the counterfeit masterpieces			1
federal prosecutors have not named or charged the painter			2
there are few details except that it is known he trained at @entity46 art school and was selling his work on the streets of @entity18 until a @entity50 art dealer converted his work into a multi-million dollar fraud			2
@entity20 , an obscure dealer from @entity54 , has been charged with wire fraud , tax evasion and money laundering , after a lengthy @entity59 inquiry			2
investigators say ms. @entity20 sold 40 of the counterfeit works through @entity27 and received about $ 63 million from their sale			1
atelier : the gallery owners were told the works of art had been in someones private collection and sealed up			1
in reality they were being created in a garage at this home in @entity17 talented : @entity36 , 73 , a quiet 73 - year - old immigrant from @entity38 , is suspected of having fooled the art world by creating dozens of works that were modeled after @entity76 s @entity75 masters that were later sold for more than $ 80 million another $ 17 million was garnered after sales through a second @entity46 dealer , @entity80			1
ms. @entity20 has pleaded not guilty and was released earlier this month			0
@entity27 , until recently one of @entity18 ’s oldest and most respected art galleries , its former president @entity24 , 65 , and mr. @entity80 have both repeatedly said they believed the works they sold had been authentic			0
‘ i am as shocked as everybody , more shocked , as i am the central victim			1
in my head , these paintings have been right			1
horrible , ’ she told @entity86			0
@entity27 sold 40 of the fakes for an alleged $ 63 million			1
before shutting down abruptly in late 2011 , the gallery made a $ 20 million payment to @entity93			1
the saga all began when @entity93 approached ms. @entity24 claiming to represent a foreign collector who ‘ was of eastern @entity97 descent , maintained residences in @entity99 and @entity100 , wished to remain anonymous , and had inherited the works ... from a relative			0
’ ‘ the story was credible , ’ said ms @entity24 to @entity86			0
‘ dealers often do not know the specifics of origin or background , or how the art left the artist ’s studio			1
you can not turn the pages of an auction catalogue or museum publication without seeing a majority of the works labeled ‘ private collection			0
’ the chain of ownership is often out of order and incomplete			0
’ low - profile : this is the garage in @entity17 where @entity36 over a period of 15 years churned out at least 63 drawings and paintings that carried the signatures of artistic giants like @entity5 , @entity128 and @entity9 @entity24 says that she did her best to get answers from @entity93			1
‘ i went to @entity20 and pushed and pushed to get more information , relentlessly , ’ @entity24 said			0
‘ my ongoing diligence met more than the gold standard ; there is plenty of evidence of that			0
’ she even claims that she had the paintings checked over to ensure their authenticity			1
‘ they were very credible in so many respects , ’ says @entity24			0
‘ i had the best conservation studio examine them			0
one of the @entity143 had a @entity145 stretcher			0
he made the stretchers for @entity7			1
they clearly had the right materials			0
some of the paintings were featured on museum walls			1
’ some experts were convinced due to the quality of the paintings that they could only have been achieved by the artists themselves			2
‘ ‘ the fact is that the entire @entity160 establishment believed in them			0
i saw the paintings , ’ said @entity156 , a scholar of @entity157 ‘ and they were very good			2
you would n’t think twice about them for a second			0
@entity24 did everything she could possibly do			0
’ near - perfect copy : @entity93 allegedly sold bogus versions @entity6 works similar to this authentic piece worth more then $ 3million a true original : this authentic @entity7 oil on canvas is part of ' @entity175 of the @entity176 ' did she know ? @entity24 ended up leaving @entity27 , until recently one of @entity18 ¿ s oldest and most respected art galleries , around the time suspicions were aroused			1
the gallery then folded after more than 160 years but others were not convinced so easily			2
one of the first experts to publicly identify some of these paintings as forgeries , @entity183 , president of the @entity184 told the @entity188 that not only the works themselves , but also the backs of the paintings and the way the canvases were treated and the frames constructed were virtually identical to that artists originals			1
‘ the way we look at reality is highly influenced by the context it ’s presented to us			0
the fact that they were sold by @entity27 , a respected gallery , influenced people ’s opinions , he said			2
’ the newly painted fakes were even heated , cooled and exposed to elements outdoors in order to make them appear older than they were			0
stories were even created to explain the appearance of so many never - seen - before works			0
both mr @entity80 and ms. @entity20 said the works had come from a family friend who had inherited the paintings			2
that they had been in the family since the 1950s and kept in a sealed container			0
things began to unravel for the gallery in 2009 after forensic testing on two paintings supposedly by @entity9 revealed paint chemicals that were historically inconsistent			1
suspicion descended on the lot , and mufti - million - dollar buyers agitated for their refunds			1
meanwhile , the @entity59 began circling @entity93			0
ms. @entity24 left @entity27 just as these suspicions began to emerge			0
soon , the 165 - year - old business shut up shop without warning - the very same week the buyer of the $ 17 million @entity5 sued both the gallery and her			1
now the lawsuits have begun with eight customers so far suing after claiming they were duped into purchasing forgeries			1
ms. @entity24 ’s lawyer , @entity237 told the @entity188 ‘ @entity93 ’s confession confirms that @entity24 was the central victim of this criminal scheme			0
’ @entity27 ’s lawyer , @entity240 , said in a statement : ‘ if proven true , the new allegations against @entity93 are a sad development for the entire art world			2
’ he said that claims @entity27 knowingly sold inauthentic paintings were without foundation			2
astonishing : ' untitled ' by @entity5 was one of the forged works			1
how imitations of the most heralded @entity157 by a complete unknown could have fooled connoisseurs and clients remains a mystery @entity255 , a @entity256 - based art historian told @entity257 that he is sceptical about how ' convincing ' such so - called ' masterpieces ' could ever appear to art experts			2
' usually when such a body of forged work is examined en masse and in retrospect , something stylistically awry , anachronistic and perhaps even downright dodgy becomes evident to the discerning eye			0
but if mr @entity36 's work avoids and evades all such doubts , then his quite unique , if totally deceptive artistic flair would be a matter of some wonder ! ' the paintings from @entity93 proved to be enormously lucrative for the ms. @entity24 ’s gallery			1
among the sales were a ‘ @entity6 ’ that went for $ 4 million , a ‘ @entity7 ’ for $ 8.3 million , and a ' @entity5 ’ for $ 17 million			1
‘ if something had been off or wrong on any one of the paintings , i would have put on the brakes , ’ she told @entity86			2
she was so convincing , and so convinced , about the paintings that she even bought three herself — a ‘ @entity7 , ’ a ‘ @entity9 , ’ and a ‘ @entity5			1
’ ‘ i was a believer			0
not to be stubborn , but i lived with three of those paintings , ’ she said			2
‘ i lived with them , and in the context of my personal collection			0

63 paintings thought to be *rediscovered* ' masterpieces ' by modernist painters were fake
buyers paid up to $ 17 million for @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity9 canvases
paintings were actually made in a garage in @entity17 for $ *5,000* each
gallery owner received $ 63 million from their sale and is ' shocked ' to find out their true origin
lawsuits have now been launched by customers who were duped into buying the paintings
