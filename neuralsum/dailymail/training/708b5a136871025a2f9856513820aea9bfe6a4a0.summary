@entity0 will take a one - goal advantage into the second leg of their last - 16 @entity4 clash against @entity5 following a 2 - 1 win at the @entity7			1
@entity9 's first - half double was enough to hand the @entity11 giants victory , as they take two valuable away goals into the second - leg clash on march 18 at the @entity15			1
here , @entity17 's @entity16 gives his big match verdict to tuesday night 's events in @entity20			1
@entity9 celebrates the crucial first away goal for @entity0 after an emphatic finish past @entity23 @entity24 wants his teams to play with two strikers			2
that ’s his philosophy but it left @entity5 exposed , especially in the first half			2
they only played one striker in this fixture last year , so he clearly wanted to go on the offensive			0
but @entity35 and @entity36 are not designed to chase and press teams			0
they needed one striker sitting deep but with two further forward and the @entity5 midfield chasing shadows , @entity0 could dominate			1
@entity5 playmaker @entity35 ( middle ) is not the type of player to chase and press teams @entity36 ( middle ) is another of those luxury players , like @entity35 playing against @entity0 , you do n’t want to give anything away			1
but that ’s exactly what the first goal was			0
it was far too easy for @entity9			0
the second was not too good , either			0
@entity54 was dragged wide and with no midfield protection , @entity55 came flying out of the defensive line			0
that left space for @entity59 to drive into and once @entity5 started retreating , left back @entity60 bombed forward and was able to pick out his pass , which is not hard when the defenders are like mannequins			2
@entity65 players left @entity9 unmarked as he notches @entity0 's second goal at the @entity7 @entity9 , who scored only once in six games against @entity5 at @entity68 , was on song on his return to @entity71 the 28 - year - old , pictured scoring his second goal , was afforded too much space in crucial areas of the pitch i thought we might have seen the best of @entity59 , but he was excellent			1
he receives the ball in positions where almost every player in the world would lay it off			0
it was the @entity59 of old — though i ca n’t remember @entity59 missing a penalty or spurning an open goal too often ! @entity59 ( middle ) looks to go in between both @entity35 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) @entity59 ( right ) watches on as @entity5 stopped @entity23 does brilliantly to save his last - minute penalty the 27 - year - old then sent his headed rebound well wide - but despite that impressed for @entity0 on the night it feels like another false dawn for @entity5			1
before the match all the talk was of how they can match @entity0 , but they were still short			0
they did well to get it back to 2 - 1 but it will be difficult at the @entity15			1
it seems that @entity5 ’s quest for @entity4 greatness is going to take longer than they thought			2
city trio @entity36 ( left ) , skipper @entity55 ( middle ) and @entity54 ( right ) look on despondently @entity0 's front three were magnificent			2
@entity59 , @entity9 and @entity107 were all so willing to run straight at defenders			2
it was terrific to watch			0
with @entity9 as a focal point in the middle , @entity107 and @entity59 could cut inside onto their stronger foot and they tore into @entity5			1
no longer do @entity0 just pass for the sake of it			0
they are more direct , can play on the counter and their current system is getting the best out of @entity59 and @entity107			0
@entity107 , like @entity9 and @entity59 , was in inspired form as @entity0 secured a impressive 2 - 1 win at @entity5			1

@entity0 beat @entity5 2 - 1 at the @entity7 on tuesday
a @entity9 double was enough to give the @entity11 giants victory
@entity17 's @entity16 *believes* @entity5 's *tactics* against @entity0 left them completely exposed and the result was *inevitable*
@entity16 felt they needed one striker sitting deep in order to *thwart* @entity134 's men breaking on the *counter-attack*
the former @entity138 defender also thought @entity59 was brilliant
