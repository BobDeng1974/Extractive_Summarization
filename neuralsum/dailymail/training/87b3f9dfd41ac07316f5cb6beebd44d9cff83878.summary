@entity0 is being considered as the @entity2 ’s candidate for @entity4 vice-president on @entity6 ’s executive , which would make him the first playing member of world football ’s most important committee			1
@entity10 defender @entity0 is one of four past and present footballers — the others being @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 — who are in the @entity2 ’s thoughts for the post			1
this is because @entity19 executive member @entity18 , the most obvious successor when @entity21 ’s @entity20 steps down next year , does not want to work with a regime led by @entity23 , who is certain to be re-elected for a fifth term as @entity6 president in 2015			2
@entity0 , in action for @entity10 , could be the next @entity4 vice-president at @entity6 @entity0 joined @entity10 in the summer after he was allowed to leave @entity27 the @entity2 have no plan b in place for another contender from the other @entity31 to face competition for the @entity4 vice-presidency in a vote at the @entity35 in @entity36 in march			1
so @entity2 general secretary @entity37 , who rules out himself and @entity2 chairman @entity38 from standing due to their current commitments , is sensibly examining other options			0
and putting forward such a big - name player as @entity0 would go down well with @entity19 president @entity43 , who wants to see more players on committees			2
meanwhile , another problem to be faced is that @entity2 of @entity48 president @entity47 believes there is a ‘ gentlemen ’s agreement ’ in place for @entity48 to fill the next @entity4 vp seat at @entity6 as they are the only @entity31 never to have done so before			2
but the @entity2 claim any such contract — and @entity48 say they have a signed paper — is now null and void following recent reforms in which the four @entity31 preserve their law - making roles on the international @entity58 , while all 54 @entity60 countries will vote in future on @entity4 ’s @entity6 vice-presidency			0
@entity21 ’s @entity20 ( left ) is due to step down next year from his position as vice-president there are six broadcast and newspaper journalists being interviewed this week for the job of @entity71 sports editor , which the @entity71 have yet to get anywhere near right			1
a strong set of candidates come from @entity71 , @entity77 , @entity78 and national newspapers			0
the interview panel were split between wanting a talking head or a news - getter , but the make - up of the shortlist suggests the preference will be for finding stories rather than waffling across outlets			0
@entity14 's expensive taste following @entity6 ’s fuss over the gifts of ultra-expensive watches at the @entity93 , there ’s never been any questions asked about each member of the @entity97 team receiving a pricey , specially engraved @entity99 watch chosen by the captain			1
this time @entity101 has gone for a steel gmt - 2 priced at around £ 7,500			1
football powerbrokers @entity38 ‘ six - watch ’ @entity38 and @entity43 both gave the impression at the @entity106 venue summit in @entity107 that everyone on the sports circuit — including the media — get expensive gifts all the time			0
it should be noted the press freebies at the @entity97 this week consist of a tartan credit card holder , a notebook and a box of chocolates , as opposed to the £ 16,400 @entity118 in @entity38 and @entity43 ’s goodie bags at the @entity120			2
@entity60 @entity97 captain @entity101 opted for a steel watch priced at £ 7,500 for each of his players the @entity97 schedule details just one hour and 10 minutes from the estimated end of play next sunday before the winning team appears in the media centre for interviews			1
this should at least ensure the triumphant players are rather less tired and emotional than they were at @entity132 in 2012			0
it was three hours after the winning putt before they arrived and they were far more concerned about carrying on celebrating than facing the press			0
both @entity97 captains , @entity139 and @entity101 , whose love - in on monday hopefully wo n’t continue all week , are leaving it to their players to decide when it is appropriate to tweet from @entity143 — a high - risk tactic when such a savvy tweeter as @entity146 caused controversy for using the f - word when his club @entity149 beat @entity27			1
meanwhile , @entity101 says he has measures in place to ensure none of his team arrive on the course 11 minutes before their tee - off time , as @entity157 did at @entity132			0
but fortunately for @entity157 , it would take about that time to reach the first tee on the @entity160 from his @entity143 bed			0
@entity101 and his opposite number @entity139 have been relaxed during the build up to the @entity97			2

@entity0 is one of four past and present footballers being considered
@entity20 will step down next year as the @entity4 vice-president
six journalists will be interviewed this week for the job of @entity71 sports editor
@entity101 has chosen a £ 7,500 watch for each of his @entity97 players
