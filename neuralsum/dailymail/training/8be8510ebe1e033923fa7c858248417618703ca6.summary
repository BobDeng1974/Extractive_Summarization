by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 18 february 2013 @entity2 - powered lasers could protect @entity3 from any more asteroids judged to be flying too close , a new study claims			2
@entity7 researchers have outlined a plan for solar powered space defences which could vaporise an asteroid as big as the one which flew past @entity3 on friday night in 60 minutes			1
the same system could destroy asteroids 10 times larger in about a year , with evaporation starting at a distance as far away as the @entity2 , the researchers claim			1
@entity2 - powered asteroid - busting lasers : described as a ' directed energy orbital defense system ' , @entity19 is designed to harness the power of the @entity2 and convert it into a massive phased array of laser beams after @entity3 's close shave with asteroid 2012 @entity26 on friday night - and the unexpected meteorite explosion which injured 1,000 @entity28 that morning - attention has turned to technology which could be used to defend our planet			1
the 130,000 ton , 150ft - wide lump of space rock hurtled past at 17,400mph - eight times as fast as a bullet from a high - powered sniper rifle - making its closest approach at 7.25pm on friday evening			1
if it had struck our planet it would have exploded with one thousand times the force of the atom bomb dropped on @entity45 in 1945			2
in the run up to the close shave - an event which occurs roughly once every 40 years - astronomers were keen to point out that their calculations showed little chance of asteroid 2012 @entity26 actually hitting our planet			1
but in the event a similar , or bigger interloper is spotted on a collision - an event thought to happen every 1,200 years or so - academics from the @entity57 , @entity58 , and @entity59 , @entity59 , have outlined a plan to destroy it before it can destroy us			2
they say their concept , dubbed @entity64 of @entity65 an @entity66 , or @entity19 , is ' a realistic means of mitigating potential threats posed to the @entity3 by asteroids and comets			2
' described as a ' directed energy orbital defence system ' , @entity19 is designed to harness the vast power of the @entity2 and convert it into a massive phased array of laser beams			1
these can then be aimed at any threatening - looking asteroids to destroy them before they can get too close			0
how asteroid 2012 @entity26 looked in a long - exposure image taken from @entity3 : if it had struck it would have exploded with one thousand times the force of the atom bomb dropped on @entity45 in 1945 extinction - level event size : radar images of the three - mile - long asteroid @entity84 captured by @entity86 's @entity85 on december 12 and 13 as it passed the @entity3 at a distance of some 4.3million miles @entity88 , a professor at @entity59 , who contributed to the research , said : ' this system is not some far - out idea from @entity93			1
' all the components of this system pretty much exist today			1
maybe not quite at the scale that we 'd need – scaling up would be the challenge – but the basic elements are all there and ready to go			0
' we just need to put them into a larger system to be effective , and once the system is there , it can do so many things			1
' indeed , the researchers say that aside from vaporising extinction - level event size asteroids , the @entity19 system has a number of other potential uses - even as a spaceship propulsion system			1
professor @entity88 and @entity58 physicist @entity114 calculated the requirements and possibilities for @entity19 systems of several sizes , ranging from a desktop device to one measuring six miles in diameter			0
the larger the system , the greater its capabilities , they said			1
for example , @entity19 2 – at 100m in diameter , about the size of the @entity125 – ' could start nudging comets or asteroids out of their orbits , ' professor @entity88 said			0
powerful : this plot shows time to evaporate an @entity132 - like asteroid versus its diameter , versus several laser power levels			1
the baseline @entity19 system has approximately 100 gigawatts of laser power but @entity19 4 – at 10km in diameter , about 100 times the size of the @entity125 – could deliver 1.4 megatons of energy per day to its target , said professor @entity114 , obliterating an asteroid 500m across in one year			1
such a sized system could also accelerate interplanetary travel far beyond what is possible with the chemical propellant rockets used today , professor @entity114 claims			1
it could also power advanced ion drive systems for deep space travel , he said			0
able to engage multiple targets and missions at once , he claimed , @entity19 ' could simultaneously evaporate an asteroid , determine the composition of another , and propel a spacecraft			1
' larger still , @entity156 6 could enable interstellar travel by functioning as a massive , orbiting power source and propulsion system for spacecraft			1
it could propel a 10 - ton spacecraft at near the speed of light , allowing interstellar exploration to become a reality without waiting for science fiction technology such as ' warp drive ' to come along , said professor @entity114			0
scalable : this plot shows @entity19 laser power and spot diameter versus @entity19 array size			0
the @entity19 system is modular and can be built up in sections each of which is immediately operational the researchers say recent and rapid developments in highly efficient conversion of light to electrical power have made such advances a possibility today when just 20 years ago they would have appeared impossible			1
an asteroid big enough to destroy @entity183 skimmed past the @entity3 at just after 7pm on friday night			1
the flyby by the 150ft , 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was the closest shave for an object of this size since records began			0
although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 @entity26 hitting our planet , if it did , it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on @entity45			2
its closest approach - passing within 17,000 miles , which is closer than some satellites - was at 7.25pm gmt. the flyby occurred just hours after a much smaller meteor exploded above @entity28 's @entity204			0
astronomers said the two events were merely a coincidence and that the objects were travelling in opposite directions			0
' our proposal assumes a combination of baseline technology – where we are today – and where we almost certainly will be in the future , without asking for any miracles , ' said professor @entity114			0
' we 've really tried to temper this with a realistic view of what we can do , and we approached it from that point of view			0
' it does require very careful attention to a number of details , and it does require a will to do so , but it does not require a miracle			0
' professor @entity88 added : ' these are not just back - of - the - envelope numbers			0
they are actually based on detailed analysis , through solid calculations , justifying what is possible			0
and it 's all available under current theory and current technology			0
' there are large asteroids and comets that cross the @entity3 's orbit , and some very dangerous ones going to hit the @entity3 eventually			0
' many have hit in the past and many will hit in the future			2
we should feel compelled to do something about the risk			0
realistic solutions need to be considered , and this is definitely one of those			0
' professor @entity114 , who began work on @entity156 a year ago , said : ' we have to come to grips with discussing these issues in a logical and rational way			2
' we need to be proactive rather than reactive in dealing with threats			2
' @entity257 is not an option			2

@entity7 researchers call their idea a ' directed energy orbital defence system '
it could vaporise an asteroid as big as the one which flew past on friday night in just an hour , they claim
researchers call for more ' proactive ' work on asteroid defences , since ' duck and cover is not an option '
