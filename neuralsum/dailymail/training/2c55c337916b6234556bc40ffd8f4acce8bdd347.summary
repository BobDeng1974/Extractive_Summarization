by @entity0 the @entity2 writer whose @entity4 profile was knocked off its intended cover story spot in favor of the now infamous @entity8 and @entity9 cover , has spoken out			1
according to the @entity11 , @entity10 took to his @entity13 page to smugly post a review of the controversial @entity2 issue , in which his story is declared ' the jewel , ' of the april edition			1
' after getting bumped from the cover of april @entity2 for @entity24 and finding out only once it hit newsstands , i think i have earned the right to post this little bit of frothy praise , ' mr @entity20 wrote , making a dig at the fact that he was the last to know of the last minute change of cover spot			1
' mr @entity20 , who has previously profiled giants including @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 for @entity2 , concluded frankly with : ' so there			0
' he later removed the post and deleted his @entity13 account this morning			1
and the @entity42 cover did n't only come as a surprise to mr @entity20 ; it stunned legions of avid @entity2 readers too , many of whom took to the publication 's website to vent their disapproval			1
' i have always purchased @entity2 , ever since i was a teenager and i felt like i could always rely on @entity2 to inspire me and educate on a number of levels , ' wrote one woman			0
ditched : mr @entity20 's story on supermodel @entity4 ( pictured in @entity70 last week ) ran alongside a photo spread shot by @entity47 which was originally reserved for the cover ' i do n’t buy tabloids for a reason because i do n’t look up to or find inspiration in people with no talent and even less morals			1
the last bastion of style has fallen today			0
' but @entity82 , the magazine 's editor - in - chief , defended her choice and also put an end to rumors that @entity9 had been ' begging ' her to put @entity8 on the cover of @entity2			2
she wrote in her @entity89 : ' you may have read that @entity9 begged me to put his fiancée on @entity2 ’s cover			2
he did nothing of the sort			0
the gossip might make better reading , but the simple fact of the matter is that it is n’t true			0
' mr @entity20 's profile on 21 - year - old supermodel @entity4 , which lost the cover story battle , came with an array of tastefully shot photos of the blonde with the famous curves in a series of slim fitting gowns			1
smiling all the way to the bank : @entity82 's ( left ) controversial cover is flying off the newsstands , despite mr @entity20 's ( right ) thinly veiled opinion that his @entity4 story should have taken the cover spot in it , ms @entity4 , who launched into fame thanks to her buxom 2013 @entity114 cover - explains that while she ' likes being sexy ' , she is cautious in how she portrays herself to the world			1
' i definitely have limits , ' she says			0
' there 's a line between becoming , you know , a little cheap and cheesy versus being sexy			0
and i try to be very careful of that line			0
' as for ms @entity82 's shock decision to idolize the @entity126 couple on her cover , it seems her choice is actually proving to be a wise one , as the issue is flying off newsstands			2
according to the @entity11 , the controversial april issue is set to sell around 400,000 copies			0
comparatively , @entity134 's cover sold more than 355,000 copies and @entity137 's cover sold nearly 300,000 .			2

@entity10 took to @entity13 claiming he did n't even know his cover had been ditched until it hit newsstands
the post was then deleted and his profile has since been removed
