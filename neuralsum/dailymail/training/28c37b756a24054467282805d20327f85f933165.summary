so when this pest control boss left his shiny new blue @entity7 outside his home while he went on holiday , it was no wonder the birds decided to strike back			2
@entity12 returned from his fortnight break to his home in @entity15 , @entity16 , to discover his new vehicle had been smothered in the gulls ' faeces - and the clean up cost would top £ 500			1
when @entity12 returned after a two - week break he found his motor splattered with seagull poo after it was ' constantly bombarded ' for 14 days mr @entity12 , a director of pest control firm @entity24 , said : ' part of my work involves deterring seagulls and removing nests so it 's as though the birds decided to get their revenge on me			1
' when he returned from his holiday last friday he found his vehicle - which he only bought a week before going on holiday - splattered with seagull poo after it was ' constantly bombarded ' for 14 days			1
after washing his care for more than an hour mr @entity12 gave up and sought professional help as the muck had eaten away some of the paintwork			2
mr @entity12 , a director of pest control firm @entity24 , said : ' the gull used my new car as target practise while i was away on holiday			0
' it was completely covered and the droppings had eaten right through the paintwork			0
the poo only needs to be left on a car for a period of 12 hours and the damage will be done , as mr @entity12 discovered ' i took it to a local garage who told me the whole area needed re-spraying			1
' @entity58 , who owns @entity59 near @entity60 in @entity16 , said it only takes a few hours for for bird muck to inflict irreparable damage to vehicles			0
he said : ' the poo only needs to be left on the car for a period of 12 hours and the damage will have been done and the whole area will probably need re-painting			1
' the hot weather has literally been baking the poo into the paintwork and setting it hard really quickly			0
' the best advice is to wash it off with soap and water straight away			0
' he said repair bills range from £ 100 for minor damage and go up to £ 2,000 if the whole car needs re-spraying			1
a 2008 study by insurance firm @entity83 found that @entity85 motorists paid out a staggering £ 57million - a - year to repair paintwork damaged by bird poo .			2

' bombardment ' of poo was left on car and ate away at paintwork
clean up and repair bill of new @entity7 cost @entity12 £ 500
seagull poo only needs about 12 hours before damage becomes *irreversible*
