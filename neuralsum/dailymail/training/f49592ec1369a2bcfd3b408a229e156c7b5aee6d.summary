if in may you had told @entity4 supporters their team would head into the fifth match of this season unbeaten and standing second in the @entity8 there is a good chance the men in white coats would have got a nod			1
owner @entity14 had cast a cloak of uncertainty over the club by putting it up for sale , manager @entity13 was under pressure from fans restless after another campaign flirting with relegation , and star striker @entity24 had ruptured his achilles tendon			1
but football has a way of making the unfathomable happen and in the space of one productive summer , @entity4 can suddenly embrace positivity again			1
it is they , after their best start since the 1998 - 99 season , who look down on @entity37 , saturday 's visitors			1
@entity39 wheels away after scoring the winner against @entity41 that took @entity4 second @entity13 has managed to turn around the club 's fortunes after two struggling seasons at @entity46 there is reason to keep the optimism cautious of course , the season is young , but it is worth examining how @entity13 has altered the atmosphere of the club in such a short space of time			1
the 1 - 0 win at @entity41 last weekend gave credibility to previous victories over @entity60 and @entity61 , alongside the draw with @entity63			0
it was a performance built on defensive foundations and tactical clarity			0
clearly , the backline is more secure than previously			0
@entity68 may not have been a signing to inspire but he has brought organisational skills and experience to the extent that with @entity73 missing at @entity75 @entity74 , criticised last term , slotted in effectively			1
@entity77 has been recalled from his two - year exile because finances meant @entity13 could defuse his ‘ @entity83 ’ and the @entity81 international has been a revelation			1
@entity84 on the opposite flank has strengthened further			0
@entity13 has raised the average age of the back four from 25 last season to 28.5 this			2
@entity68 ( @entity90 ) and @entity91 ( c ) have brought a sense of solidity to @entity4 's backline @entity77 ( c ) has been a revelation since being brought back in from the wilderness by @entity13 his midfield trio is made up of energetic players quick to close spaces			1
@entity100 has flourished , @entity101 is in the form of his career , and @entity104 brings nous			2
average possession stands at only 37 per cent and passing success just 72 per cent but as @entity109 , or even @entity110 , will tell you , it is what a team does with the ball that counts			0
goalkeeper @entity116 has only faced 10 shots so far , second only to @entity118 at @entity60 ( 6 ) , and has reacted when tested			0
‘ they look very assured , ’ former @entity4 and @entity120 manager @entity119 told @entity121			1
‘ it would appear to me they ’ve said let ’s get it right at the back , let ’s have a good base			0
’ @entity100 's performances in midfield have earned him a first cal - up from @entity120 boss @entity133 @entity105 ( r ) chases down @entity134 , the @entity4 loanee is determined to prove doubters wrong from there @entity4 have been clinical in attack , remarkably gaining ten points from just six shots on target – the lowest in the division			1
four goals have been scored , two each for @entity144 and @entity145			0
@entity4 have made their best start to the @entity8 season since 1998 - 99 ... 16 aug @entity60 ( a ) 0 - 1 23 aug @entity63 ( @entity148 ) 0 - 0 31 aug @entity61 ( @entity148 ) 2 - 1 13 sep @entity41 ( a ) 1 - 0 those slender margins can not continue to prove so fruitful , as @entity119 points out , but @entity24 has this week returned to training and could push for a place in the squad within a month			1
his impact would instantly give @entity4 an added edge			2
the recurring name uttered by those associated with the club when asked about @entity4 ’s upturn however belongs to the man @entity13 boldly brought in as his no 2			1
@entity161 is said to have impressed everyone at the club with his manner , communication skills and driven attitude			2
promising winger @entity167 , 19 , describes @entity161 as ‘ brilliant ’ and tells an illuminating anecdote about his first day of training			2
‘ i did n’t start the session that well and he tapped me on the shoulder after a half an hour , ’ recalls @entity167			0
‘ he said : “ are you alright ? ” and i replied “ yeah ”			0
and then he asked me : “ when do you start training then ? ” ’ @entity161 ( r ) stands shoulder to shoulder with @entity177 ... bringing his usual winning mentality @entity13 had no doubts that his close friend @entity161 would thrive outside of the television studio @entity161 has the minerals and the medals to offer players honest appraisals no matter their status and his ferocious winning mentality has permeated the side			1
@entity13 admitted @entity161 ’s appointment following the dismissal of disliked @entity191 ‘ raised eyebrows ’ but added : ‘ his knowledge meant he was too good to be a tv pundit			1
i love working with him , we have a laugh			0
i beat him at the crossbar challenge nearly every day			0
’ @entity13 this week signed a new contract keeping him at @entity4 until at least june 2018 to allay any doubts about his role beyond next summer and it is clear he shares a strong bond with @entity14			1
‘ i do n’t have an agent , ’ says @entity13			2
that ’s the big thing			0
there were never any complications			0
’ in the window @entity13 took on extra responsibilities as chief executive @entity213 surprisingly left			2
@entity13 dealt with a number of deals in and out of the club but new chief executive @entity217 , recruited from @entity37 , will now take the reigns			1
@entity24 is close to returning from injury and could feature against @entity37 on saturday @entity221 owner @entity14 ( @entity90 ) has been re-energised and seems less enthusiastic about selling the club his arrival , and the contracts for @entity13 , @entity77 and @entity39 , indicate @entity14 is planning for the long - term even with the ‘ @entity228 ’ sign swinging in the breeze			1
that should warm the hearts of @entity4 fans as much as anything			2
the @entity221 has visited @entity233 on numerous occasions in the past few months and held meetings with all department heads			0
re-energised , is the buzzword used to describe him			0
so too are the club ’s faithful , who will push @entity46 close to capacity today			0
finally they have cause to be cheerful .			0
