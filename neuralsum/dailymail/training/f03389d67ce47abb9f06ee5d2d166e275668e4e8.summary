@entity25 @entity24 ( pictured ) heard how the couple bought more than a dozen cars , including luxury bmws and @entity29 the compensation was awarded to their daughter @entity54 , who suffers from cerebral palsy and needs round - the - clock care after suffering brain damage due to medical negligence at her birth			1
jailing the pair , judge @entity33 said : ' the way the money was spent was nothing short of greed and indulgence			0
' turning to @entity7 , the judge said : ' one can only begin to understand the difficult time you had giving birth to a severely disabled child at the age of 14			1
' but you , as her mother , were the person closest to her - the person she looked to trust			2
you have betrayed that trust in the most appalling and distressing way			0
' @entity7 , 44 , was found guilty of three counts of theft and one of converting criminal property following a trial last year @entity13 , of @entity84 , and @entity7 , of @entity85 , stood in the glass - fronted dock as they were sentenced , separated by a security officer			1
neither showed any emotion as they were led away			0
judge @entity33 said : ' there are many parents who have to look after disabled children			0
' the majority do so without the sums of money that were awarded to your daughter to help with her care			1
they do so out of love			0
' the judge explained how @entity54 has limited speech and has little body movement			0
she can move one of her hands , which she uses to operate her wheelchair			0
judge @entity33 said the initial medical negligence pay - out included a direct payment to @entity7 of £ 270,000 for expenses she had already incurred			1
it also provided for a £ 4,000 - a - month income for the family on top of benefits they were entitled to			2
the rest of the money , the judge said , was supposed to be invested to provide a secure income for @entity54 for the rest of her life			0
the judge said all these payments , plus rental income from a property portfolio , meant the family had a large legitimate income ' but it was not enough to fund the extravagant lifestyle that you both clearly enjoyed for a substantial period of time '			0
she said that for about five years the couple , who divorced in 2004 after a 14 year long marriage , were spending about £ 117,000 a year			2

the judge said that partly as a result of her parents ' actions , miss @entity43 's fund was now extremely depleted and only £ 150,000 remained			0

' there are many parents who have to look after disabled children			0
the majority do so without the sums of money that were awarded to your daughter to help with her care			1
they do so out of love ' - judge @entity14 she said the fund will probably be exhausted in two years and the state will then have to pick up the bill			2
' i do not know what the consequence will be to her ( @entity54 ) , ' the judge said			0
' she is well aware of what you have done and the emotional impact on her can not be ignored			0
' judge @entity33 said that after the compensation award the couple legitimately bought a huge house in the @entity179 area for £ 117,000 and spent up to £ 600,000 renovating it and adapting it for their daughter			1
but , the judge said , it was now only worth £ 425,000 because most potential buyers have no need for the adaptations			0
the judge explained how much of the money stolen by grandmother @entity7 and @entity13 was secured from the @entity192 - the body that administers the compensation payment - in order to invest in property for their daughter			1
but , she said , the pair sold the houses and pocketed the cash			0
they even made a down - payment on a property in @entity203 and then spent the £ 90,000 when the deal was cancelled			2
judge @entity33 said the total amount of money stolen by the pair from their daughter was just over £ 450,000			0
she was particularly scathing of £ 31,000 in cash @entity7 took out of a bank account when she realised the police were on to her and ' you knew the game was up '			2
