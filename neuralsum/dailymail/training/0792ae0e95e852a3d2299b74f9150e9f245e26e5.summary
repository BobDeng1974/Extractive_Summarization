by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity7 want to introduce military - style drones to create spectacular entertainment shows , state - of - the - art aerial floating movie screens and magical flying puppets in their @entity5 theme parks			1
tourists flocking to @entity11 in @entity12 and @entity13 in @entity14 could be in for a treat if plans to use the small , unmanned flight systems are accepted by the @entity5 government			1
the company have applied to use the cutting edge technology to create aerial displays such as floating projection screens and marionettes held up by the contraptions			1
@entity7 claim that if the new technology is approved it will greatly improve their entertainment shows @entity7 claim the drones would be able to carry a blimp - sized character through the sky , while other puppets could even be animated by a flock of drones manipulating different limbs they say the drones , which would be controlled from the ground and carefully monitored to prevent them colliding with each other , will lead to a huge improvement in the way in which the puppets are orchestrated in their hugely popular parades and shows			1
the drones would also be resistant to strong winds , the company said			0
in the case of marionettes , a drone would be capable of carrying a blimp - sized character through the sky to simulate flight			0
other puppets could even be animated by a flock of drones manipulating individual limbs			0
the commercial use of drones is currently banned by the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , but @entity7 says the technology can solve a problem with aerial displays which have been ' limited in how easy it has been to alter the choreography and to provide a repeatable show '			1
@entity7 has filed three patents which could allow them to use the small , unmanned machines the commercial use of drones is currently banned by the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , but @entity7 say aerial displays could be improved by the introduction of drones it has even been suggested that large mail order companies could develop @entity73 to deliver their goods to customers in the future ' this is a significant improvement over prior flying characters , which typically were provided in the form of parade or other blimps / balloons filled with hot air or other gases and that had little and / or awkward articulation of any movable parts , ' the company said in its patent application			2
in filing for the patents , @entity7 joins a list of companies pressing for the @entity5 government to allow commercial use of the flying machines which have so far been restricted to military use and government surveillance			2
the machines , also called unmanned aerial vehicles or @entity73 , are currently used in war - zones and military operations to provide an effective means of gathering intelligence and venturing into hostile areas without the need of a pilot			2
@entity7 published the applications last week for what it described as aerial display systems with floating pixels , floating projection screens and marionettes held up by the contraptions @entity7 joins a list of companies pressing for the @entity5 government to allow commercial use of the flying machines which have so far been restricted to military use and government surveillance the machines were first used in @entity120 , but there have been significant developments in the technology since then			1
it has even been suggested that large mail order companies could develop @entity73 to deliver their goods to customers in the future			0
it was last year that the chief executive of @entity131 , the world 's largest online retailer , revealed the company had been testing unmanned drones to deliver goods			0
the @entity59 is currently in the process of drafting rules for the commercial use of drones for everything from tv news coverage to package delivery to crop monitoring			0
representative for @entity7 have not yet commented on the proposals .			0

company has applied to use unmanned flight systems in their shows
@entity7 says the technology will provide better choreography
machines will also be able to hold up floating movie screens
