president @entity0 was heckled on thursday during a fund - raising speech in @entity2 , @entity3 as he spoke to supporters about the need to cast their vote to ensure the @entity7 remains in @entity9 control			1
reaching the end of his address to tech leaders , @entity0 was interrupted by a man in the crowd and without missing a step , told him that he should speak to him later because he was ' screwing up the end of my speech			1
' the heckler was excitedly shouting about the freedoms of @entity23 who he claimed live under a cruel regime backed by the @entity26 , to which the president replied he completely agreed , ' although , why do n't we talk about it later because i am just about to finish , you and me , we 'll talk about it			2
' scroll down for @entity32 let me finish : the president responds to his heckler , asking him to quieten down so he can finish his speech undeterred and seemingly uninterested in the president 's offer , the heckler continued to throw the president off , who shot back about how much he ' wanted to hear ' from him			2
in one amusing aside , the president , keen to complete his final message , told the man that despite his rude interruption , ' i love you back			2
' the president then finished up by telling the heckler that he was keen to finish but that he ' kinda screwed up my ending			1
' addressing the tech leaders , the president warned his supporters to dig deep in their wallets to fund @entity9 candidates and feel a sense of urgency about congressional elections in november or risk further gridlock in @entity59 and a failure to move on their priorities			2
love you back : the president said he was more than happy to speak to the heckler afterwards - but he was disappointed to be thrown off the end of his address @entity0 was the headline speaker at four @entity3 fund - raising events , raising his two - day total to five			1
his last was a @entity72 event in @entity2 co-hosted by @entity74 president @entity73 and @entity76 ceo @entity75			1
about 250 people paid between $ 1,000 and $ 32,400 to attend			1
during his remarks , @entity0 struck at the heart of the issue that republicans are using against @entity9 in their campaigns : the @entity83 , the @entity83 law whose troubled rollout has given @entity0 's political opponents much grist for criticism			0
@entity81 have mounted a strong effort to seize control of the @entity7 from @entity9 and are also trying to build on their majority in the @entity92			0
@entity0 said the effort must be stopped in order to prevent more gridlock in @entity59			0
' the reason that we 've got gridlock right now is because you 've got a party that 's been captured by folks who are on the wrong side of the issues , ' he said			0
free speech : a man shouts at president @entity0 as @entity0 speaks at a @entity107 reception in @entity2 , @entity3 on thursday @entity0 , whose own job approval rating under 50 percent is weighing down @entity9 prospects in november , said @entity81 offer nothing more than their vow to repeal the healthcare law			1
' if that 's all they 've got , then they should n't be running either chamber , they should n't be running the @entity92			0
and they sure should n't be running the @entity7 , ' he said			0
the tech industry has raised questions about the scale of the @entity121 's surveillance under the @entity0 administration , but there 's little sign that @entity0 is losing support in @entity72			0
@entity0 made no mention of these concerns in his luncheon speech attended by 65 guests who paid up to $ 32,400 per couple for the @entity130			1
@entity0 told them that majorities of @entity26 support the direction that @entity9 want to take the country , such as on raising the minimum wage and making sure women receive equal pay as men , but that they have ' lost faith that we can actually make it happen ' because of @entity59 gridlock			0
great start : @entity26 president @entity0 is introduced to speak by @entity76 ceo @entity75 at a @entity107 fund raiser in @entity2 , @entity3 important message : president @entity0 speaks at a @entity107 reception in @entity2 , before he was heckled @entity0 needs @entity9 to do well in november to allow him to advance his agenda in his last two years in office , in 2015 and 2016			1
but most political analysts believe @entity81 will build on their @entity92 majority and stand a decent chance of winning the @entity7			0
@entity0 has been using fund - raising speeches to warn of this outcome , saying @entity9 need to avoid getting distracted by media attention on the 2016 presidential election to choose a successor to him			2
@entity0 said in @entity159 that @entity9 need to gain seats ' in order for us to not simply play defense but to actually go back on the offensive for the @entity26 people			0
