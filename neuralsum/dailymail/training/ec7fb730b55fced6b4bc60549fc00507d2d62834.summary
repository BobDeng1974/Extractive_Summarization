by @entity0 have you ladies ever spent ages perfecting your make - up before a night out only to find that when the photos emerge on @entity7 the next day , your face looks washed out and greasy ? very annoying and happens to me all the time ! flashing camera lights can really wash you out , so make - up for camera needs to be amped up so it 's a lot bolder and the colours more vivid			1
i recently shot the images for my official 2015 calendar , and as i knew i was going to be posing up in sexy @entity18 lingerie , i opted for high - octane glamour : sultry , smokey eyes , chiseled cheekbones and cascading curls			1
if you 're off to a ball or special event , give this look a go and you 'll look equally as fabulous in the photos as you did on the night			0
here 's how to do it : step 1 – flawless face the base is the key component to a picture - perfect make - up look , so always start proceedings with a good quality primer like @entity45			2
this will reduce the appearance of pores and provide a velvety smooth canvas for the rest of your make - up			2
a full - coverage foundation is a photoshoot essential , and so my make - up artist applied @entity57 using the @entity58			2
@entity0 says it can be hard to achieve a heavy makeup look on a shoot without looking washed out by camera flashes the long - wearing formula makes it the ideal foundation for a special event or night out			1
if necessary , conceal any dark circles under your eyes with @entity70 - @entity69			2
set your flawless complexion in place with a translucent powder such as @entity74 , which will give your base a matte yet natural - looking finish and significantly prolong its wear			0
the camera will definitely be your friend with this grease - proof complexion combo ! step 2 – @entity83 thanks to the glorious beauty invention that is contouring , we can all fake razor - sharp cheekbones like @entity87 '			1
my go - to contour product is @entity45 's @entity90 , which i wore on the shoot			1
using an angled brush , gently brush the darker contour colour just below your cheekbones – suck your cheeks in and apply the colour to the hollowed area , following the natural downward line			0
@entity0 used heavy contouring to fake razor - sharp cheek bones a good tip is to use the centre of your eye as a guide to where you should stop the contour , and make sure you blend the lines out with a fluffy brush for a natural finish			1
you can also sweep the colour across your temples and along your jawline for a supermodel - style chiselled effect , or down the sides of your nose to slim it down			0
next , highlight the high points of your face – your cheekbones , brow bones and the centre of your nose – with the shimmery champagne shade in the @entity45 palette			0
@entity0 says it is important to set your foundation with a translucent powder step 3 – alluring eyes the make - up artist opted to enhance my green eyes with some smokey shadow in a similar emerald hue , using the @entity138 5 @entity137 in @entity139			1
pack the colour onto a fluffy brush and gently dab it atop your eyelid – apply as many layers as you need for a vivid wash of colour before smoothing it out with a blending brush			0
then , for a seductive stare , define the outer corners of your eyes with a slightly darker shade and blend out again			0
wearing colour on your lids can make your peepers pop in a way mascara alone can not , so if you tend to stick to neutral eyeshadow tones i suggest you grab a palette and have a play around ; you may be surprised with the results ! @entity0 went for a sultry smoky - eye look to pair with her lingerie themed calender next , carefully line your upper and lower lash lines with a black liquid or gel liner like @entity169 , extending the line slightly outwards from your upper lash line for a sultry feline effect			1
finally , for full , flirtatious lashes , apply a couple of coats of @entity176			0
step 4 – luscious lips too much colour on both the lids and lips can sometimes look a tad extreme , especially if you 're off to a formal event , so i usually advise teaming a smokey eye with a failsafe yet super-sexy nude lip			0
line your lips first with a pencil in a shade similar to the lip colour you 're using – i used @entity190 in @entity191 – then apply your lipstick with a small lip brush in layers for a full , pronounced pout			0
@entity0 recommends applying a couple of coats of mascara in order to achieve flirtatious lashes for the shoot , i opted for @entity203 lipstick in @entity204 – it 's one of my favourite lipsticks , offering intense , highly pigmented colour that lasts for hours			1
and there you have it - say goodbye to being camera - shy and hello to turning heads all night long ! you can get all the products i used from online beauty boutique @entity215			1
my official 2015 calendar is out in september and i ca n't wait for you all to see it			0
if you ca n't wait until then , though , make sure you check back here next week for some exclusive snaps and behind - the - scenes footage from the shoot ! lots of love , @entity225 xxx			2
