' the lyrics that appeared online were influenced by a style of hiphop that i was experimenting with at a private freestyle session and blurted out in a moment of madness			0
there is absolutely no excuse - i take complete responsibility for my actions - but they were in no way thought out or represent at all my attitude towards women , rape and violence			1

i completely understand that @entity18 had no choice but to terminate my contract today			1

i am mortified that i have brought so much embarrassment to my colleagues and employers these last few days			0
my biggest regret however is not to do with losing my job , but that i have hurt and let down so many people including those in a vulnerable situation and i am so very deeply ashamed of this			0
i am also mortified to have put my mother , grandad and girlfriend through the last few days which they are hurt and bewildered by and so do not deserve			0
once again to everyone who i have let down and hurt			0
' a source told the @entity118 : ' these videos are disgusting and bosses now need to work out exactly how to handle the situation			2
' but while they are furious , they need to make sure his future is dealt with fairly ... he is hoping the fact that they are suggesting he might go on tv to make a grovelling apology is a sign that they could see a future for him			0
' the source suggested @entity2 could appear on several tv shows in order to ensure his apology reached the broadest audience possible , or possibly hold a press conference about the scandal			1
but the broadcaster confirmed last night that there was no longer a place for @entity2 at @entity3			1

last night a spokesman for support service @entity172 said : ‘ this is yet another shocking example of the hatred directed towards women by some men			2
‘ to dignify this with the name “ music ” does music an injustice , but the far greater injustice is that our young people are subjected to lyrics which encourage sexual violence against women			2
‘ if these violent and hate - filled lyrics were directed against other groups in society , they would be counted as incitement to violence and treated as a crime			2
’ under fire : the 25 - year - old actor , a contestant on family show @entity160 in 2008 , has been slammed by charities and women 's groups over his offensive lyrics @entity203 , chief executive of @entity204 , said : ‘ he is a high - profile character			0
