the @entity2 cargo jet that crashed in @entity3 this week , killing its two crew members , was flying on autopilot until seconds before impact , even after an alert that it was descending too quickly , authorities said on saturday ' the autopilot was engaged until the last second of recorded data , ' said @entity12 , a senior official with the @entity13			2
he said information retrieved by investigators from the flight data recorder aboard the @entity2 jet showed that its auto throttle also was engaged until moments before the fiery crash			1
there is a hill and some trees at one end which can make it ' tricky ' for larger jets obstacles : at the start of runway 18 at @entity46 airport lay a number of trees and also a hill that can make landing a large plane ' tricky ' the @entity62 jet was approaching the runway at @entity56 before dawn on wednesday when it clipped the trees in an adjacent residential area and crashed into a steep embankment well short of the runway			1
@entity12 , who spoke at a media briefing near the crash site , had said on friday that the pilots received a low altitude warning barely seven seconds before the sound of impact			1
he repeated that in his remarks on saturday but did not say whether the alert had triggered any attempt by the crew members to disengage the autopilot as part of a last - ditch attempt to abort landing and re-gain altitude			2
the pilots did not issue a distress call			1
@entity12 stopped short of saying there was anything unusual about a so - called ' instrument approach ' to the airport using autopilot			2
but he said the @entity13 would be looking closely into ' @entity2 's instrument approach procedures ' and how it typically went about guiding a large cargo hauler to touchdown on @entity46 - @entity93 's @entity92			2
that 's the runway the @entity2 jet was approaching when it crashed and @entity12 said the investigation would include a flight test at the airport in a @entity2 @entity62			2
' we have n't ruled anything in , have n't ruled anything out , ' he said			2
the aircraft went down less than a mile from the end of @entity92 at @entity46 's airport before dawn wednesday			2
@entity2 has identified the victims of the crash as capt. @entity108 , 58 , of @entity109 , @entity110 , and first officer @entity111 , 37 , of @entity112 , @entity113			1
investigation : @entity13 board member and spokesman @entity12 during grid search of crash site at a field north of the site at @entity46 landing on the runway can be tricky for pilots , an expert said , particularly those flying big jets like the twin - engine @entity2 cargo carrier			1
@entity12 said the plane was being flown by the captain — who had 8,600 hours of flight experience , including 3,200 hours in an @entity62 — but investigators do n't know whether @entity108 or @entity111 had ever before landed on runway 18			1
' we 're going to do our best to find out , ' he said			2
@entity12 said investigators will analyze the airplane 's weight to determine whether it should have attempted a landing on the runway , the shorter of two runways at @entity46			1
with a large hill and trees at one end , the runway lacks the electronics for a full instrument landing			0
that forces pilots to make key judgments about altitude while aiming a descending aircraft at a runway that 's 5,000 feet shorter than the airport 's main runway , which was closed for maintenance work at the time of the crash			1
some pilots simply avoid landing on runway 18 when possible , said veteran commercial pilot @entity158			1
' when i heard they were using @entity92 18 it caught my attention because of that hill , ' said @entity158			0
' it 's sad , but it did n't surprise me			0
' @entity158 , a retired @entity165 captain , is now chief executive of @entity166 , a firm based in @entity168			0
black box found : @entity13 investigators work around the tail section of the @entity2 cargo plane resting place : a wooden cross by a church is shown near the wreckage of a @entity2 @entity62 cargo plane that crashed on the north side of the @entity46 @entity179 , president and chief executive officer of the @entity181 , an @entity182 , @entity183 - based international watchdog group , told @entity184 in an interview on thursday that a ' full instrument ' landing was not highly advisable at @entity188			1
the airport can be tricky to land at because it is nestled among hills and that is especially true of @entity92 , said @entity179			0
@entity179 , a former @entity192 pilot , said he had touched down on the runway many times himself			0
' it is not a full instrument landing			0
you have to visually fly into that runway , ' he said			0
' sometimes it takes nuance to land there			0
you have to realize that hill is there or you could come in too low			0
' the crash occurred shortly before dawn in rainy conditions as low - lying clouds hung over @entity46			1
so far , @entity12 said there was nothing to indicate the crash was caused by engine failure or any mechanical issues			1
he also said the runway lights were examined and found to have been ' within one one - 100th of a degree of being properly aligned ' at the time of the crash			1
@entity2 has identified the dead crew members @entity217 , 58 , of @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity111 , 37 , of @entity112 , @entity113			1
as a standard part of any accident investigation , @entity12 said the @entity13 was looking into the physical and mental well being of @entity108 and @entity111 in the 72 hours before the accident			1
@entity108 , the captain of the downed aircraft , had about 8,600 hours total flying experience , including more than 3,200 hours in the @entity62 , according to the @entity13			1
destroyed : @entity13 ( @entity13 ) investigators examine debris of a @entity228 cargo plane after it crashed on approach at @entity46 in @entity3 crushed : part of what appears to be one of the airplane 's engines is caked in dirt blaze : flames rise from a @entity2 @entity62 cargo plane which crashed near the airport in @entity46 , @entity3 on wednesday the @entity13 previously said a preliminary investigation did n't reveal any evidence of engine failure before the plane struck trees about one mile away from the end of the runway			1
it crashed into the bottom of a hill less than a quarter mile after hitting the trees			0
the @entity62 , which weighs about 172,700 pounds when empty , was at the end of a 45 - minute flight from @entity251 , @entity252 , to @entity46 when it went down			0
a flight summary from flightaware.com , which tracks airplanes , shows the aircraft made a descent in steps , which @entity158 said is a ' dive and drive ' method common on runways with the same navigational guidance as @entity92			0
@entity12 said the aircraft went down during its first landing attempt			0
@entity12 said investigators have not found any problems with the runway 's lights or navigation system , which typically provides pilots with information about their lateral position but not about their altitude , unlike those on runways where pilots can land using only instruments			1
tragic : fire crews investigate where a @entity2 cargo plane lies on a hill at @entity46 after crashing on approach a postal inspector officer looks over the debris of an @entity2 @entity62 cargo plane after it crashed on approach in the early hours of wednesday @entity290 records from the morning of the crash show the plane would have descended through overcast conditions to only a few clouds at 1,100 feet			1
within seconds after the plane hit a tree and at least one turbine sucked in wood , the twin - engine plane crashed			1
it hit the base of that large hill mentioned by @entity158 , who said he had landed on runway 18 about a half - dozen times , including on some flights as a cargo pilot			0
located near the southern tip of the @entity309 foothills , @entity46 's airport is nestled in a low spot between @entity311 to the south and hills that lie at the northern end of @entity92 , which is 7,000 feet long			0
the main runway is 12,000 feet long and runs east and west , meaning pilots do n't have to negotiate the rough terrain			2
the @entity13 said the longer runway was closed for maintenance work on its lights early wednesday , leaving the shorter runway as the only path to the ground			0
runway 18 is an approved runway with a valid approach , @entity158 said			0
' it is definitely legal , but it i had a choice i 'd use another runway first , ' he said			0
fatal crash : two pilots died when the plane went down in the early hours of wednesday disaster : what appears to be parcels are strewn across a field after a @entity2 cargo plane came down shortly before dawn in @entity3 a key task for investigators will be determining why the @entity2 jet was low enough to hit trees			1
the impact sheared off pieces of the aircraft and sent them crashing onto two homes along with large pieces of limbs			0
@entity351 , 17 , said he witnessed the crash while getting ready for work before dawn			2
@entity351 , who lives with relatives across the street from the crash site , said it was unusual to see such a large aircraft attempting to land on the runway			2
' i saw the sky turn orange and i looked up and i saw it in the air on fire , ' @entity351 said			0
' i watched it hit the ground and dirt flew up			0
this whole area just shook			0
' @entity158 said the flames could have been shooting from the plane after it struck the trees .			2

investigators have not found any problems with the plane
capt. @entity108 , 58 , and first officer @entity111 , 37 , died in the crash
investigators are trying to determine how much rest the pilots had before the crash
