@entity1 is likely to face a second election shortly after may 7 because of a knife - edge outcome , political experts have warned			2
the likelihood of another coalition lasting five years has been dismissed as miniscule by a leading academic			1
a second election swiftly after polling day is ' extremely likely ' , professor @entity7 of the @entity8 said			1
@entity1 is likely to face a second election shortly after may 7 because of a knife - edge outcome , political experts have warned ' i do n't see another coalition government lasting five years , ' he said at a briefing by polling experts on the latest election forecasts			1
other experts also warned that a ' messy and unstable ' left - wing alliance was likely to be in power even if the @entity23 won more seats or a greater share of the vote			2
mr @entity7 predicted a repeat of the disastrous left - wing @entity29 - @entity29 pact of the 1970s			1
it ended with @entity33 prime minister @entity32 losing a vote of no confidence			0
' that was not very successful			0
it had to go to the @entity38 for a bail out and there were huge industrial problems			0
' the disastrous pact led to the rise of @entity44 and the @entity45 held on to power for another 18 years			1
experts said the likeliest outcome at the general election would be the conservatives winning the most votes , but a left - wing alliance forming to keep them out of power			1
@entity55 academic @entity54 said there was a high chance @entity33 would form either a minority government or coalition with the help of the @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 or other minor parties			2
there was ' only a 42 per cent chance of a @entity23 - led government , even though there is a two - thirds chance of the @entity45 being the largest party , on votes or seats			1
' he added : ' the single most likely outcome is â€¦ a seriously hung parliament with the conservatives as clearly the largest party but a majority on the left , including the @entity61 and @entity62			1
' @entity79 answers questions from 02 employees in @entity82 this afternoon ahead tonight 's ' @entity83 labour leader @entity84 addresses supporters during a visit to @entity87 in north @entity88 this morning this would be a ' messy and unstable situation ' and it was ' not clear that this diverse group of parties would be able to sustain a stable government '			2
the conservatives would probably turn to the @entity97 first and then the @entity62 to try and form a government but they were still likely to be short of a majority , he added			2
the @entity61 's surge in @entity101 was likely to be hugely damaging for @entity33 but @entity84 could still walk into @entity102 propped up by an alliance of left - leaning parties			0
a massive landslide to the @entity61 was inevitable , with the party winning at worst six times more seats than it currently holds or at best nine times more			0
@entity33 's disastrous performance in the @entity101 polls could mean the party only has one safe seat : the @entity114 seat of @entity115			0
@entity116 , professor of politics at @entity118 , said the @entity61 vote surge was nothing new			0
some 45 per cent of @entity101 had voted for the @entity61 in the 2011 @entity101 parliamentary elections , 45 per cent voted in favour of independence during last year 's @entity101 referendum and the polls were now showing 45 per cent supported the @entity61			0
but for the first time @entity101 voters were voting the same way at a @entity128 election as they would for the @entity101 parliament .			0

second election after polling day is ' extremely likely ' , academics claim
professor @entity7 of @entity8 predicts left wing coalition
but he said : ' i do n't see another coalition government lasting five years '
@entity45 will finish largest party but without enough allies to form a coalition
