@entity0 are the ‘ dirtiest ’ nation in @entity2 history when measured by the number of red cards at finals compared to the number of games played			1
taking into account only those countries who have played in at least three finals , the @entity0 come out on top having received four reds in 10 matches — a ‘ red rate ’ of 40 per cent			1
next in the bad boys ’ list are @entity18 , with seven reds in 20 matches , at a rate of 35 per cent , followed by @entity22 ( three in 13 , 23 per cent ) @entity23 and @entity24 ( two in nine , 22 per cent ) and @entity25 ( five in 23 , 22 per cent )			0
off you go : @entity27 saw the first red card of the @entity29 after his nasty foul on @entity31 marching orders : @entity0 's @entity33 reacts to being shown the red card by referee @entity35 in the 2010 @entity2 all those nations except @entity24 will be in @entity37			1
the countries with the most red cards at @entity2 finals are @entity37 ( 11 ) , @entity41 ( 10 ) and @entity42 ( 9 ) but they have played many games in finals — 97 , 70 and 47 respectively			1
the ‘ cleanest ’ country — all major nations have shared 159 reds since 1930 — are @entity48 , with only one red card in 56 @entity2 finals matches			1
the offender was @entity52 ( @entity53 ’s uncle ) in 1994			0
that ’s a ‘ red rate ’ of two per cent			2
@entity56 ’s rate is five per cent , with three red cards in 59 @entity2 finals matches shown to @entity59 ( 1986 ) , @entity60 ( 1998 ) and @entity61 ( 2006 )			1
among those playing in fewer than three @entity63 , the @entity64 and @entity65 & @entity66 have the highest red rates , each with two reds in three games			0
brutal : @entity18 's @entity71 is given his marching orders in the opening game of @entity74 seeing red : @entity60 is sent off against @entity41 in 1998 the history of red cards at past @entity63 suggests @entity56 might be happy to land @entity79 official @entity78 as the man in the middle for their game with @entity42			2
history shows that @entity79 refs have dished out more red cards — 22 from a total of 159 — than officials from any other nation			2
and half of those have been shown to @entity93 teams			0
that statistic suggests @entity79 officials single out teams from the same continent			0
@entity78 has given four reds in the last two @entity63 — to @entity99 , @entity65 , @entity0 and @entity100 .			0

the countries with the most red cards at @entity2 finals are @entity37 ( 11 ) , @entity41 ( 10 ) and @entity42 ( 9 )
