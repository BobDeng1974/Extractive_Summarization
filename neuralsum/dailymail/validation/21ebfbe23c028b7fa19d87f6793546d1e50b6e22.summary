@entity1 winner @entity0 has offered his support to @entity3 , arguing that cycling should not object to @entity5 joining the former @entity7 footballer in @entity8 this summer to raise money for the fight against cancer			1
@entity0 , the @entity13 winner whose own son suffered with leukaemia , believes @entity5 ’s involvement with @entity3 ’s ‘ @entity18 ’ event will only help raise awareness and cash for the cause			1
@entity3 and @entity5 are united by both being cancer survivors but some senior figures in cycling – @entity26 president @entity25 and @entity28 boss sir @entity27 – have objected to the controversial @entity29 returning to the @entity8 roads			1
@entity5 , who was stripped of his seven @entity18 title , wants to return to work fighting cancer former @entity1 champion @entity0 , pictured with former footballer and charity organiser @entity3 , supports @entity5 's return to raise money and awareness of the disease @entity5 is set to be part of a team of cyclists rising the route on a day before the @entity1 starts the @entity29 cyclist revealed details of his doping scandal in an interview chat show host @entity49 @entity5 's former team - mate @entity50 said he would support the disgraced cyclist ’s plan to ride part of the @entity1 route this summer if it was for ‘ altruistic ’ reasons			1
@entity50 , who rode with @entity5 in the @entity57 team in 1998 and 1999 , was however wary of his motives for accepting an invitation from fellow cancer survivor @entity3 to join him in a charity ride			1
‘ i sincerely hope his reasons for wanting to do that are @entity63 have no idea what his motivations are			0
if it 's altruistic then it 's hard to condemn anything altruistic , across the board			2
if it 's part of a greater commercial strategy or legal strategy , then i feel like that 's disingenuous			2
’ @entity50 , speaking at a @entity77 anti-doping conference , said @entity5 ’s lifetime ban from competition was not the only way he had been punished			2
‘ one of the biggest penalties that guys face when they are caught for doping is the loss of their social group , ’ he said , ‘ they 're no longer accepted amongst their tribe , their people that they were once close with			2
he would like social acceptance again			0
i 'm assuming that 's a little bit what he 's after ( with the charity ride )			1
’ @entity50 welcomed reports that @entity5 has met with @entity29 anti-doping boss @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98			1
i do n't know what his motivations are , but to me that 's good news			2
my experiences with @entity96 have been nothing but positive			0
’ @entity3 and a team of cyclists will ride the route of this summer ’s @entity13 one day ahead of the professional peloton , with @entity5 planning to join them for two stages			1
but @entity25 branded @entity5 ’s involvement ‘ inappropriate and disrespectful ’			1
@entity0 , who in 1987 became the second of only two cyclists to win the @entity117 , the @entity118 and the world road race title , said : ‘ i believe in what he ’s ( @entity3 ) doing , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i know that by having @entity5 involved with @entity3 in his charity to generate funds for leukaemia - i think that his overall picture will be a lot brighter			1
' he will bring in a lot more money for very , very worthy causes			0
it 's about going forward			0
we ca n't change the past			0
we must use the past to make the future better			0
’ it was @entity0 ’s son , @entity136 , who suffered with leukaemia and the @entity138 , speaking to the @entity140 radio show earlier , said : ' i can speak from my heart because my son had leukaemia and he 's on the straight now , thank @entity146 , ’ he said			2
‘ and when you 're involved with that , to see how far a euro goes , and how euros are lacking to fund research			0
' so i 'm speaking from a different perspective maybe than someone who just a general cyclist that 's very disappointed in what @entity5 has done to the sport			1
so i know the power he has			0
' i know that people are going to despise me for saying so , but i think we have got to move on			0
i think that he faulted - he was n't the only one that faulted - he 's been punished			0
' he 'll be punished for the rest of his life for what he did			0
but there is a redemption somewhere as well			0
where does it start ? does it start this year , next year , in ten years ' time ? does it start by doing a charity cycle ? ' former @entity174 , @entity175 midfielder @entity3 ( right ) won nine full @entity7 caps in his football career			2
