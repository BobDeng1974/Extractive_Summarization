by @entity0 ' a generation is growing up in conditions of anxiety and deprivation ' : @entity5 said support for needy people had been ' dismantled ' @entity5 reignited the debate over food banks yesterday by claiming a generation of children is growing up with ‘ anxiety and deprivation ’			1
the former archbishop of @entity14 attacked the government ’s benefits policy saying support for needy people had been ‘ dismantled ’			1
and he dismissed the benefits of the economic upturn , saying it was doing nothing to prevent ‘ day - to - day hardship ’			0
lord @entity5 spoke out after @entity22 , of which he has patron , released figures claiming the number of people fed by its five centres had doubled in a year to more than 4,600			1
he said : ‘ the facts on the ground are indisputable			0
whatever may be said about economic recovery at national level , the day - to - day hardship experienced by so many people in this country is not getting less and is not going to get less in the near future			2
‘ structures of support have been dismantled , resources for dealing with people in crisis situations have been reduced			2
‘ and meanwhile , a generation is growing up in conditions of anxiety and deprivation			0
the psychological as well as practical effects of this are long - term for those who are children now			0
‘ once again , we have to challenge those who deny this to come and see for themselves			0
’ dr @entity5 is the latest senior church figure to attack the government over poverty			1
his successor , @entity58 , used his @entity60 message to bemoan the plight of struggling families ‘ left broken and weeping ’ by hunger and debt			1
a letter signed by 600 church leaders including 36 @entity69 bishops earlier this year called on the government to deal with what it described as a ‘ national crisis ’ of poverty and people living below the bread line			1
but their concerns contradict findings by the @entity79 which show food poverty in @entity81 has reduced dramatically			2
only 8.1 per cent reported struggling to afford food in 2012 – down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 , before the economic crisis			2
critics including former cabinet minister @entity85 have also pointed out there is a ‘ near infinite demand ’ for free food and warned of the ease with which people can claim the food parcels without providing evidence of financial hardship			1
piety : dr @entity5 is the latest senior church figure to attack the government over poverty			1
his successor , @entity58 , used his @entity60 message describe the plight of families ' left broken ' by hunger and debt in april the @entity104 - a charity run by @entity107 member @entity106 which has more than 400 food banks including those in @entity111 - was accused of being ‘ misleading and emotionally manipulative ’ after claiming more than 913,000 people had received three days ’ emergency food in the past year – almost a threefold increase on the previous 12 months			1
publicity campaigns are widely accepted to have increased awareness of the service			0
applicant numbers have also swelled as a result of the @entity120 overturning a @entity107 ban on job centres advising people about food banks			2
@entity126 mp @entity125 , a practising @entity127 , said he was ‘ appalled ’ at @entity128 ’ ‘ partisan attack ’ and defended the benefits system as ‘ one of the most generous in the world			0
' ‘ it ’s interesting that @entity5 sat back under the @entity107 government when they abolished the 10p tax rate for poorer working people and presided over a huge rise in inequality between the richest and poorest			1
there was n’t much moral indignation from him then , ’ he said			0
‘ he is completely undermining his credibility with this partisan attack			0
’ poverty : a sign outside @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity144 directs to a @entity22 depot some 4,684 people , including 1,650 children , were recorded as having used @entity111 ’s food banks last year			1
this included 1,405 because of ‘ low incomes ’ , 682 due to ‘ benefit changes ’ , 364 who were in debt and 139 whose reason was listed as ‘ other ’			0
the trust admits it does not carry out checks into applicants ’ suitability to receive food parcels			2
instead , it relies on referrals from ‘ front - line professionals ’ such as gps and social workers who fill out a tick box form			0
a spokesman said : ‘ front - line care professionals make a judgement whether someone is actually in crisis and will ask questions about whether they need to be referred to a food bank			1
’ a @entity177 spokesman said @entity184 reforms were ‘ improving the lives of some of the poorest people in our communities ’			0
he added : ‘ the truth is that employment is going up , benefits are being paid to claimants more quickly and independent experts tell us that there are fewer people struggling with their food bills compared with a few years ago			2
‘ the @entity104 and other food banks agree that increased awareness has helped to explain their recent growth			0
