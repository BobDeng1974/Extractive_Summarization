by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 15 august 2012 updated : 19:23 est , 16 august 2012 when @entity2 planted 11 fruit trees on his allotment , he hoped to make enough jam to give to his pensioner neighbours			1
but it turned out he was sowing the seeds of his own eviction			0
mr @entity2 ’s pear , plum , apple , cherry and apricot trees did not impress many of his 600 fellow tenants more used to growing potatoes , marrows and leeks on their prized plots			1
they complained to the council , leading to a new set of rules requiring that three quarters of any allotment should be used for ‘ productive crops ’ such as vegetables			2
allotment owner @entity2 stands on his plot of land in protest			1
he does n't want to be evicted from the land he grows his 11 fruit trees he wo n't budge on the allotment : mr @entity2 says he will appeal the case where a judge ruled against his wishes mr @entity2 , 60 , a @entity37 - born author who lives in a tower block in @entity39 , refused to agree to the new rules that would force him to plant vegetables under his trees			1
he said he had grown potatoes , leeks and onions in the past but had produced so many that they had gone to waste			0
as a result , @entity39 attempted to evict mr @entity2 from his 250 - square - metre plot and he decided to challenge the decision in court			1
he said : ‘ the council are not playing by the rules and should be ashamed of themselves			0
they are acting like bullies			0
‘ i have invested a lot of time and money in my plot and i am not prepared to see that undone			2
’ at @entity63 , the barrister for the council , @entity62 , said : ‘ i suggest there is ample space at that plot for the cultivation of flowers and vegetables			1
’ mr @entity2 replied : ‘ no. i ca n’t plant things where the trees are supposed to grow			1
i have not breached the contract			0
this council ruling is to remove people who abandon their plots			0
i love the trees and i feel i am being penalised			1
‘ i was never given any leaflets detailing what i could grow			0
i was given permission to grow fruit trees as dwarf stock			1
’ after a four - hour hearing , district judge @entity82 ruled he could not grant an injunction against the eviction			2
but he appealed for common sense to prevail , saying : ‘ it is sad this case has come to court			2
i would encourage both parties to find some middle ground			0
’ an unrepentant mr @entity2 – who was forced to pay court costs of £ 650 – insisted : ‘ they will have to evict me if they want me out			1
i will fight all the way to the @entity96 if i have to			0
’ the 90,000 who 'd like his plot the council is now considering its next move			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we have been encouraging mr @entity2 since 2008 to bring the level of cultivation of his plot up to an agreed and acceptable standard			2
‘ in february 2011 we were left with no option but to serve notice requiring him to improve the levels of cultivation as he was in breach of his tenancy agreement			0
‘ rather than cultivate his allotment , mr @entity2 sought an injunction and a declaration from the court to preserve his rights as an allotment holder			1
we contested that mr @entity2 was not entitled to the relief requested ; the judge dismissed mr @entity2 ’s claim and awarded costs to the council			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity124 said : ‘ we understand the reasons for tenancy agreements , but would always advise councils not to impose them retrospectively			0

@entity2 had 11 fruit trees on his allotment instead of vegetables
@entity132 said his trees were not ' *occupying* *sufficient* space '
plot - holder took the row to court to prevent being evicted
' i love the trees and i feel i am being penalised ' , said plot - holder
author was forced to pay £ 650 in legal fees as judge ruled against him
