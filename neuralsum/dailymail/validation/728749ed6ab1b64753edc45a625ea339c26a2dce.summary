a star that is travelling fast enough to escape the gravitational clutches of our galaxy has been discovered by a team of astronomers			2
the amazing stellar object attained its rapid speed when a nearby star exploded as a supernova , sending it out of the @entity12			1
at its current speed it would make the journey from @entity16 to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the @entity20 spacecraft three days			0
scroll down for a video showing an artist 's impression of the event astronomers in @entity26 have found the fastest ' unbound ' star in the galaxy			1
called @entity29 708 it is moving at 745 miles ( 1,200km ) per second			1
it will leave the galaxy in about 25 million years			1
this artist 's concept shows a star ( left ) being ejected from the galaxy , although in reality the supernova would have been faded long ago the star , known as @entity29 708 , was first discovered in 1982 by dr @entity40 of @entity41 but had since then remained ignored			1
however , a team of astronomers led by the @entity44 at @entity45 has now re-examined the star , and found that it breaks the galactic speed record for an ' unbound ' star			2
@entity29 708 is almost 62,000 light - years from @entity16 , and is on a path that will take it out of the @entity12 in about 25 million years			1
type 1a : a white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes			0
non-standard type 1a : two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion			0
@entity60 : a star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out , causing it to explode			0
type 1b and 1c : a star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds			0
@entity73 : extreme type of supernova , 50 times as energetic as other supernovas , resulting in a black hole			0
the exact cause of them is unknown			0
using the 10 - metre @entity82 and @entity84 telescopes in @entity26 , the astronomers calculated that the star is moving at about 745 miles ( 1,200km ) per second			1
this makes it the fastest ‘ rogue ’ star in the galaxy - one that is no longer orbiting the centre			2
‘ at that speed , you could travel from @entity16 to the moon in five minutes , ’ said dr @entity92 of the @entity44 at @entity45			0
‘ by observing the sky repeatedly over several years , the @entity97 survey , let us make a movie of the motions of the stars in the sky			0
‘ that enables us to study the behavioirs of extremely rare and weird stars like @entity29 708			2
’ while a handful of other stars escaping the galaxy are known , this is the first to have been found that was ejected by a thermonuclear supernova explosion			2
@entity29 708 , which is a helium - rich white dwarf , was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up			1
at the speed @entity29 708 is travelling it would make the journey from @entity16 to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the @entity20 astronauts three days			1
pictured is the view of @entity16 seen by the @entity126 crew as they circled the moon in december 1968 this particular class of supernova is known as type 1a , where material is transferred between one star and another until one reaches a critical mass , and explodes			0
often , the secondary star is obliterated in the resulting explosion , or pushed away at a more sedate speed			0
it is ' pushed ' away because the loss of its companion means it no longer has a star to orbit , but retains its forwards momentum , so it is flung into space			0
the specific characteristics of this binary system , its distance and the mass of its companion , allowed @entity29 708 to remain intact while still achieving record speeds for an unbound star			1
stars like the sun are bound to our galaxy by its gravity , and orbit its centre at relatively moderate velocities , typically tens to a few hundreds of kilometres per second			0
only so - called hyperveolocity stars are known to travel so fast that they are unbound to the galaxy			2
@entity29 708 , which is a helium - rich white dwarf , was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up ( illustration shown )			1
it is the first star found to be leaving the galaxy caused by such an event , and could provide an insight into these types of supernova in addition , to escape from the @entity12 an object needs to exceed the ‘ escape velocity ’ - the strength of its gravitational pull			1
the escape velocity of our galaxy is about 375 miles ( 600km ) per second , which @entity29 708 easily exceeds			1
astronomers hope that studying the star could help reveal how such helium - rich stars and thermonuclear supernovae are linked .			0

astronomers in @entity26 have found the fastest ' unbound ' star in the galaxy
called @entity29 708 it is moving at 745 miles ( 1,200km ) per second
it will leave the galaxy in about 25 million years
the star was given its rapid speed *due* to its companion going supernova
it is the first star found to be leaving the galaxy caused by such an event
