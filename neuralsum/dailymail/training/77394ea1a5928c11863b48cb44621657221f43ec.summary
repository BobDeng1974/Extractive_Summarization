but when a trivial comparison was made between @entity12 's president @entity11 and @entity13 , the country 's strict censorship laws swung into action			1
a picture of @entity11 walking with @entity16 at a @entity18 summit was published on the @entity12 social media site @entity19			1
harmless : the shot of the presidents at a summit in @entity18 captures them in a pose similar to @entity13 and his friend @entity23 it was placed next to an illustrated image of @entity13 and his pal @entity23 , who have been drawn in a similar pose to the politicians			2
comments that were posted on the blog were removed and the picture was deleted by website monitors			2
despite being removed form the site , the images went viral , with critics saying over-zealous censors had misread the frivolous comparison			0
@entity39 reports that @entity41 â€™s @entity40 said censors had ' nipped in the bud what could have been a positive pr campaign tailor - made for president @entity11			1
' the @entity47 's censors are known for interfering with even the most minor of government criticism on social networking sites			0
perhaps they agreed with @entity23 's catchphrase , ' the wonderful thing about @entity23 is i 'm the only one '			0
the blogger , called @entity57 posted the two pictures on the @entity12 equivalent of @entity60 , on tuesday			2
relaxed : the presidents waved to the cameras while on a casual stroll in @entity65 estate , @entity18 unflattering : censors were not happy with the idea that @entity12 's president is similar in any way to the fictional bear , who is known for getting his paws stuck as he scoops out pots of honey according to @entity76 , @entity75 posted the censor 's message response : ' the post is inappropriate to be published '			1
the blogger wrote , ' @entity82 secretary ( webmaster ) is stingy and lacks of sense of humor ' but , according to the @entity39 , a recent @entity86 study showed that posts ' with negative , even vitriolic , criticism of the state , its leaders , and its policies are not more likely to be censored ' than other posts .			0
