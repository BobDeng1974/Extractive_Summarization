space race : @entity1 in @entity2 as dr @entity3 , a medical engineer on her first space mission you could call it the final frontier in gender equality			2
though 12 men have set foot on the moon , no woman has yet taken that giant leap			1
but under extraordinary plans set out today , the world ’s superpowers will come together to make it happen			1
and not content to stop there , they will also build a permanent base on its surface and then travel to @entity22			2
science minister @entity23 claims @entity24 can help bring the @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 together to take space travel into its next phase			1
mr @entity23 said @entity30 – the home of @entity32 , which makes a quarter of the world ’s satellites – would be ‘ at the heart of the global space effort ’			1
last year , republican presidential candidate @entity37 promised that if he won , @entity25 would have a permanent base on the moon by the end of his second term			1
the 12 men who have set foot on the moon have all been @entity25 , but the last one was 41 years ago			1
mr @entity23 predicted that it will actually be the @entity27 who next return humans to the moon			1
@entity27 , @entity48 and the @entity25 are the only countries to have independently sent humans into space			1
just days ago , @entity51 also launched a rocket to the moon , carrying a small robotic device that will touch down on the lunar surface this weekend – the first controlled landing since 1976 on the @entity58 ’s only natural satellite			1
@entity27 has stepped up its space efforts since @entity25 president @entity60 cancelled @entity63 ’s @entity62 programme , which had been designed to build a new generation of rockets that could send people to the moon and beyond			1
advances : last week , @entity27 released a computer graphic of the first ever moon rover @entity71 @entity27 astronauts are expected to land on lunar soil between 2025 and 2030			1
‘ they are going to go first to the moon			2
they are landing an explorer vehicle this time , ’ mr @entity23 said			2
‘ what they will subsequently do is land and retrieve robotic equipment			0
then they will put a man – or i suspect a woman on the moon if they ’re being smart – and then go on to @entity22			2
‘ it ’s a long term plan and we are up for co-operation with them			0
‘ our hunger for discovery is n’t over			0
and one of the advantages of the challenge of getting a manned mission to @entity22 is that it such a big project that it probably requires global co-operation			0
' i think if you got the major powers – the @entity26 , the @entity25 and the @entity27 – working together that is possible			1
it would be very exciting			0
in the old days it was @entity105			0
in the future it will be @entity30 at the heart of the global space effort , ’ he said			0
as @entity27 launch their lunar probe , science minister @entity23 says the @entity24 will be on board with new plans ‘ @entity30 is where we do our work on robotic systems			1
a lot of the technology for the @entity122 vehicle , which the @entity123 will launch in a couple of years ’ time , was developed in @entity30			0
we are in a very good position			0
we have got a very nimble and effective space industry			0
‘ we are trusted partners of @entity25			2
we are active players in the @entity123 and we are now opening up a new relationship with @entity27			2
’ mr @entity23 said there was enormous potential for @entity24 to provide technology to ‘ help with @entity27 lunar exploration ’ and missions deeper into space			1
he admitted there was ‘ no agreed plan for getting to @entity22 ’			0
but he added : ‘ in the future i think there will be humans going to @entity22			0
i suspect it will be a global endeavour			0
i think it is possible within 30 years			0

plans *outlined* today show @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity27 plan to establish moon base
science minister @entity23 revealed aim to send a woman on mission
@entity27 expects to have astronauts on lunar soil between 2025 and 2030
