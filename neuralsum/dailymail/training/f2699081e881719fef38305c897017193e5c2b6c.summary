after the 35th annual @entity1 came to a chaotic end on wednesday night there was one thing that had everyone talking			1
it was n't a showstopping dress on the red carpet or a drunken slurred speech - it was the moment 56 - year - old @entity9 took a tumble backwards mid-performance			1
after failing to undo her @entity13 cloak , which she has since said was tied too tightly , @entity9 fell down a set of stairs landing in a crumpled heap on the floor			1
the 37 - year - old rapper was roped in to perform at the awards show last minute after @entity39 reportedly did n't show up for rehearsals on monday			2
however , he left a stunned audience opened - mouthed as he blasted out his new single @entity43 , which is includes the n - word said repeatedly			1
and despite @entity47 's attempts to censor him , the word was heard three times on television , with many viewers taking to @entity52 in droves to complain			1
but @entity36 and @entity9 are n't the only people to have caused controversy at the infamously boozy awards show			1
@entity36 's performance came under fire as he continuously used the n - word forcing @entity47 to mute his performance who can forget the time that @entity63 stormed the stage as @entity65 performed his hit song @entity66 in 1996			1
the @entity68 frontman pranced around in front of the late singer and eventually was chased off by one of his backing dancers			0
there was also that time when @entity75 called comedian @entity76 a p * * * * * b * * * * * * after he appeared to be drunk while presenting an award in 2008			0
from @entity81 's rambling acceptance speech in 2014 to @entity82 throwing a jug of water over @entity85 in 1998 , @entity79 looks back over the most awkward , and controversial , @entity87 moments ever ... last year @entity81 gave an incredibly rambling acceptance speech seemingly slagging off the very industry that was honoring him 2014 : @entity81 's @entity90 in 2014 the awkward @entity1 moment happened when @entity93 's frontman @entity81 gave an acceptance speech on behalf of the band for their @entity96			1
a rambling @entity81 lambasted the @entity98 music industry and claimed that rock ' n ' roll would n't go away			0
he said : ' it will never die			0
and there 's nothing you can do about it			2
' the speech was met with mass criticism as he seemed to be berating the very people who had given the band the accolade			2
the singer then ended his rambling message by dropping his microphone on the floor and walking off , leaving the audience stunned			0
in the same year @entity115 caused laughs throughout the event when he left his bandmates hanging around on stage as they collected their @entity121 award			2
the @entity123 singer nearly missed his big moment because he was in the toilet			0
running on stage in the nick of time he said : ' i 'm really sorry i was having a wee , the toilets are ages away			2
' as @entity132 came up behind @entity133 , interrupting her acceptance speech she swore at the cameras live on television 2012 : @entity137 the suits if there was one thing that did n't go down well at the @entity1 in 2012 it was when @entity132 interrupted @entity133 as she gave her acceptance speech for @entity142			1
in a rush to introduce @entity144 and apparently spurred on by the show 's producers @entity132 came on stage as @entity133 was making her thank yous and said , ' i 'm so sorry , can i just cut off ? ' the singer responded by asked the tv presenter to clarify what he was saying and when he conceded that she needed to end her speech , she stuck her middle finger up to the camera live on television			1
@entity133 later said that she had been offended by the ' suits , ' who had stopped her making her full acceptance speech and that she hoped she had n't offended her fans			1
in 2010 @entity161 not only snubbed his own brother when accepting the award for the ' @entity164 of 30 years ' missing @entity165 out of his acceptance speech 2010 : @entity161 did n't want his award and threw his microphone into the audience given his history of feuds , punch ups and all round bad behavior it 's little wonder than @entity161 has enjoyed a controversial @entity87 moment			1
in 2010 when he was awarded a special ' best album of 30 years , ' award for ( what 's the story ? ) morning glory ' not only did snub his own brother and bandmate , @entity165 , in his acceptance speech he went on to ramble for a full ten minutes			1
then , when he 'd finally finished , @entity161 threw not only his microphone but his actual award into the audience			0
it was reported that @entity87 officials had to bargain with a fan to retrieve the statue and it meant the whole of the rest of the evening was delayed			0
when the @entity194 presented they were characteristically sweary and @entity76 ended up being offended by @entity75 2008 : the @entity194 got sweary and @entity93 dressed as farmers when the @entity197 family were asked to present the awards in 2008 they clearly did n't get the ' no swearing on live television ' memo			0
not only did they fill the whole show with expletives , @entity75 got particularly angry about comedian @entity76			0
when he came on stage to present an the @entity164 award @entity75 deemed him too drunk to do the job after he stumbled over his words			2
she said to him : ' you â€™re p * * * * *			0
p * * * off you b * * * * * * ! ' the @entity93 's speech had to be cut from @entity47 's broadcast after they began to slag off the @entity1 school @entity76 later said that it he had got confused over the autocue and felt offended by what @entity75 had said			1
keeping the controversy flowing the @entity93 's who won the award that @entity76 was presenting came on stage and promptly began to slag off the brit school			1
the band had attended the school from which the awards take their name , but @entity81 proceeded to reveal that they had n't had a very good time there			0
so bad was his speech that the producers of the show were forced to cut it short and not air it on the show			1
whilst accepting his award for the @entity237 in 2000 @entity235 decided to challenge @entity161 to a fight 2000 : @entity239 called for a fight and dj @entity241 thought he 'd won an award at the 2000 @entity1 @entity239 decided to use his moment of air time to challenge @entity245 front man @entity161 to a fight			0
there had long been an issue between the two of them after @entity161 had called @entity235 the , ' fat dancer from @entity252			0
' an inebriated - seeming @entity235 took to the stage whilst accepting his best @entity98 song award and said to the audience : ' so , anybody like to see me fight @entity161 ? would you pay to come and see it ? ' @entity161 , a hundred grand of your money and a hundred grand of my money			1
we 'll get in a ring and we 'll have a fight and you can all watch it on tv			0
' @entity241 stormed on stage thinking he had won an award and ended up with @entity273 's drink in his face unfortunately despite @entity235 's bravado and willingness to fight @entity161 , the event never ended up taking place			2
@entity235 's speech was n't the only awkward moment of the night			1
as @entity273 was presenting the ' @entity282 dj @entity241 's friends joked to him that he had won			2
unfortunately @entity241 was so drunk at the time that he believed them stumbling on stage to collect his honour			2
when he was challenged by @entity273 , who called him a c * * * , @entity241 tried to get into a fight with the @entity290 drummer and eventually ended up with his drink in his face			0
@entity82 performed at the brits in 1998 and later the lead singer @entity293 chucked a bucket of ice cold water over @entity85 1998 : @entity82 gave @entity85 a soaking two very odd things happened at the @entity1 in 1998			2
firstly @entity85 was invited to the awards			0
secondly , while he was happily sitting at his table he ended up having a bucket of water thrown over his head by lead singer of the band @entity82 , @entity293			0
@entity293 showed no regret at his actions and said : ' if @entity85 has the nerve to turn up at events like the @entity1 in a vain attempt to make @entity310 seem cool and trendy , then he deserves all we can throw at him			0
' @entity85 looked pretty unimpressed after having a bucket of ice cold water thrown over him when he attended the @entity1 in 1998 it was during this @entity65 performance at the @entity1 in 1996 that @entity63 jumped on stage and mooned the audience 1996 : @entity63 mooned @entity65 perhaps one of the most infamous moments in @entity87 history was when @entity63 stormed the stage during @entity65 's performance of @entity66 in 1996			1
@entity63 , the @entity68 singer , took to the stage and ran around bending over and showing his bottom to the world as the late singer performed			1
@entity63 was pictured after the event swigging @entity327 from the bottle - he later revealed he was n't happy with the fact that @entity65 had been trying to play god @entity63 later said that he acted the way he did because he could n't handle the fact that @entity65 was pretending to be @entity333			1
he said : ' he was pretending to be @entity333 - i 'm not religious but i think , as a performer myself , the idea of someone pretending to have the power of healing is just not right			2
' rock stars have big enough egos without pretending to be @entity333 - that was what got my goat , that one particular thing			0
' when @entity346 and @entity347 presented the awards in 1989 it was a total disaster , the pair kept on messing up the autocue and fluffing their lines 1989 : the @entity346 and @entity347 co-presenting disaster in 1989 the show 's producers made an attempt to revamp the @entity87 bringing in the odd combination of the page 3 model @entity346 and @entity347 of @entity358 to present			0
the twosome had a disastrous show			0
guests came on at the wrong time , they fluffed their lines and they had a pre-recorded @entity65 speech which they forgot to air altogether .			1

@entity9 , 56 , took a tumble during her brits number on wednesday night
@entity36 also gave an awkward performance using the n - word on stage
in 2012 @entity133 swore on camera after @entity132 cut off her speech
in 1996 @entity63 interrupted @entity65 's performance
