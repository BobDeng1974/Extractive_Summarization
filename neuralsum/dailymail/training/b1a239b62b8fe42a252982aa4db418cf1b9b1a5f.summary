by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 7 november 2013 a grove of hemlock trees at the @entity3 is under threat after being infested by an invasive insect			1
the hemlocks , often referred to as ' witness trees , ' near where the hijacked plane crashed in @entity9 on september 11 , 2001 , have been invaded by the hemlock woolly adelgid , a tiny insect that feeds by sucking sap from the trees			1
a spokesperson from the @entity15 said wednesday that the hemlocks are infested with the insect , which can kill trees within a few years , but hope a treatment plan will be able to save them			1
tiny killers : adult woolly hemlock adelgids only measure 1mm but an infestation can kill a 100 - foot - tall tree in five years tragedy site : investigators at the hemlock grove where @entity27 crashed near @entity9 , @entity3 on september 12 , 2001 , which is now being threatened by tiny insects the insect was accidentally introduced to the @entity31 from @entity32 in 1924 , and figures from 2007 show that 50 per cent of the geographic range of eastern hemlock had been impacted by the insect			1
' i would say the stand is prettily heavily infested , ' @entity37 , an entomologist with the @entity38 , told @entity0			2
' trees are showing fairly significant impact , ' such as reduced growth , thinning of the crown , and off color needles			0
@entity27 was traveling from @entity46 , @entity47 , to @entity48 in 2001 when it was hijacked by four terrorists			1
@entity51 sign : the tiny white egg sacks of the hemlock woolly adelgid are a visible sign the insect is taking hold of the tree the 33 passengers and seven crew members were killed when the plane crashed after passengers fought back against hijackers			1
plot : @entity27 was one of four planes that were hijacked as part of the september 11 attacks ; 44 people , including four terrorists , died in the crash the @entity69 said the terrorists likely wanted to crash the plane into the @entity72 or the @entity73			1
the @entity74 refers to the meadow and hemlock grove where the plane crashed as the ' sacred ground , ' because it 's the final resting place for many of the remains of the passengers and crew			2
@entity83 adelgids , which are native to @entity32 , lay their eggs on the underside of hemlock branches , and the young insects feed on the sap of the trees , causing them to lose needles and die within five to 10 years			2
the insects appeared in @entity92 in the 1950s and in southeastern @entity3 in 1969			0
they 've been spreading north and west ever since			0
@entity37 said the @entity38 is working with the @entity74 on a treatment plan for more than 1,300 mature trees in the roughly 11 - acre grove of hemlocks that will begin this week			1
they 're trying chemicals and even releasing a species of beetles that eats the adelgids , which have no natural predators in the area			0
in some other states and regions , adelgids have caused massive die - offs of hemlocks , and scientists still are n't sure if they 'll be able to save the @entity27 grove			2
' in the big picture we do n't really know if it 's a losing battle , ' @entity37 said of area			0
' we 're trying to maintain it in the condition it was in at the time of the crash			0
' the @entity15 is located in @entity9 , about 75 miles southeast of @entity120			0
the memorial drew about 320,000 visitors last year .			0

a grove of hemlock trees at the site of the @entity27 crash is infested by a tiny insect , the hemlock woolly adelgid
the insect can *destroy* trees within five years
officials are hoping a treatment plan , including introducing beetles that eat the bugs , will save the trees
on september 11 , 2001 , 44 people died after four terrorist hijacked @entity27 and the passengers fought back
