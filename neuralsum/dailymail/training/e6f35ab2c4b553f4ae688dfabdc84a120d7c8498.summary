if you 've ever dreamed of becoming a particle physicist , now 's your chance			0
@entity4 has launched its @entity5 , which lets members of the public pore through collision data from the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
it is the first time data has been made openly available for research and educational purposes			1
the public are invited to use the information for research and education			1
data will come from various experiments at the particle accelerator to date , all publications from the @entity9 have been published @entity26 , free to read and re-use			1
but this latest development is the result of @entity9 teams approving @entity32 policies to release collision data to the public			1
yesterday scientists at the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) in @entity4 , @entity14 said they had discovered two new subatomic particles by smashing protons together			1
the two new particles , called @entity39 ' - and @entity40 * , were previously predicted to exist but had never been seen before			0
it 's hoped the discovery could shed more light on how the universe works beyond the currently accepted models of physics			0
the new particles were created by firing protons around the 17 - mile ( 27km ) tube of the @entity9 , specifically the @entity9 beauty ( lhcb ) experiment			2
they were then smashed together at 99.9999 per cent the speed of light , replicating the conditions at the @entity54 ' launching the @entity55 is an important step for our @entity57 , ' said @entity4 director - general dr @entity59 in a statement			0
' data from the @entity9 programme are among the most precious assets of the @entity9 experiments , that today we start sharing openly with the world			1
' we hope these open data will support and inspire the global research community , including students and citizen scientists			0
' the first data to be released on the @entity5 will be from the @entity9 's @entity71 ( @entity71 ) experiment , first recorded back in 2010			2
to view the data , users will need to run @entity75 , and will also need to install open source software provided by @entity4 on their computer			1
the @entity71 team will release data three years after it has been collected , to give those on the team time to analyse the data before others get their hands on it			0
the first data to be released on the @entity5 will be from the @entity9 's @entity71 ( @entity71 ) experiment , pictured here			2
the @entity71 team will release data three years after it has been collected , to give those on the team time to analyse the data before others get their hands on it ' this is all new and we are curious to see how the data will be re-used , ' said @entity71 data preservation coordinator dr @entity96			0
' we 've prepared tools and examples of different levels of complexity from simplified analysis to ready - to - use online applications			0
' we hope these examples will stimulate the creativity of external users			0
' @entity4 will also release data from the @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 collaborations on the website to be viewed by anyone for research or educational purposes .			2

@entity4 in @entity14 has begun releasing collision data from the @entity9 on their @entity5 website
the public are invited to use the information for research and education
data will come from various experiments at the particle accelerator
users will need @entity75 to *download* and use the software to view the data
it is the first time the collision data has been made openly available
