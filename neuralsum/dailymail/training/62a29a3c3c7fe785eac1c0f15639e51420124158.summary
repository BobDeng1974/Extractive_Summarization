by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has been accused of ' consistently recommending ' the @entity4 series to ' minor girls			1
' as part of an ongoing investigation , @entity13 - a pro-life nonprofit - has been sending female investigators to @entity2 clinics around the country with hidden cameras , to pose as 15 and 16 - year - old girls and asking for advice related to the book			1
@entity13 president @entity16 summarized her findings from the footage for the @entity19 ; claiming that a counselor in @entity21 said : ' you need to read [ @entity4 ] , ' and another in @entity23 said : ' it 's pretty good			1
' sex advice : pro-life group @entity13 has released undercover footage of @entity2 counselors discussing , and in some cases recommending , @entity4 to 15 and 16 - year - olds ms @entity16 reports that another counselor , who labeled the @entity4 series ' extreme ' , had said : ' if it ’s consensual , again , completely normal			1
' echoing this sentiment , another counseler claimed to ' personally dislike ' the books , but said it would be ' a big eye - opener ' for the girl she believed to be 15 years old			0
the best - selling book trilogy , written by @entity42 author @entity41 , has been a storming success among a widespread audience ; selling over 100 million copies worldwide to date			2
it tells the story of @entity4 , a 21 - year - old virgin who falls under the spell of @entity4 ; a highly controlling 27 - year - old business mogul who takes her as his sex slave			0
the books involve countless explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving @entity56 ; bondage / discipline , dominance / submission , and sadism / masochism			1
the long - awaited movie , starring @entity60 and @entity61 , is due to hit theaters on @entity63 2015			0
clash of the titans @entity16 ( pictured ) is president of @entity13 , and she argues that the best - selling erotic novel encourages dangerous sexual behavior , and should be avoided by ' all ' during @entity69 and @entity68 's kinky and often violent sexcapades , @entity68 can signal her genuine distress to @entity69 by saying the ' safe word ' ' yellow ' for caution , and ' red ' for stop			1
ms @entity16 is dismissive of the concept of using safe words and points out that in one scene of @entity4 , @entity69 ignores @entity68 's use of theirs			0
she also describes many of the sex scenes as ' reading like rape			0
' she writes of @entity13 's investigation into @entity2 : ' the staffers ’ script was much the same everywhere			1
' all of the employees went on to insist on “ trust ” and elevating the “ safe word ” - a word that sex partners who are intent on extreme behavior agree to use as code for “ no , stop , and i mean it ” - to set - in - stone status			0
' in short , @entity2 counselors told our investigators that “ no ” does n't mean “ no ” anymore			1
' upon reviewing the undercover footage however , these soundbites take on quite a different nature when seen in context			0
in all instances , it is the investigator - posing as the minor - who brings up the issue of bdsm or first mentions @entity4			2
fair trial ? in all instances , it is the investigator - posing as the minor - who brings up the issue of bdsm or first mentions @entity4 , leading @entity2 staff into thematic explanations coming soon : the long - awaited movie adaption of the book , starring @entity60 and @entity61 ( pictured ) , is due to hit theaters on @entity63 2015 rather than ' recommend ' the books , most counselors actually appear to be answering questions about @entity56 , using the book as a reference to underline the importance of consent			1
one counselor at a @entity126 clinic , when quizzed on the book , says : ' anything within the sexual world is normal as long as it 's consensual ... my focus really would be on your safety , and just that it 's consensual			2
those are the two pieces that i would say are the most important part			0
' another , at a @entity23 clinic , says : ' you just want it to be safe			0
' this counselor , however , does also go into great depth on the subject of the book , and suggests the young girl further explores bdsm by getting someone she ' trusts ' to buy related toys from a sex shop , since she is under 18			2
opposed : @entity13 has an established history of protesting against @entity2 's abortion clinics ( pictured ) ' when @entity2 counselors train our girls not to expect that “ no ” means no , they disable a crucial form of protection for all women in a violent world , ' ms @entity16 concludes			1
' a world of compliant @entity162 and repulsive @entity163 is nothing short of nightmarish			0
we all should turn away from any road that leads there			0
' @entity16 issued the following statement to @entity1 : ' if a minor girl comes to @entity2 for advice because her boyfriend says he wants to try out " kink , " counselors should be strongly cautioning her on the many dangers of those practices			1
' they should not be suggesting and promoting a variety of bondage and sadomasochistic activities and recommending pornographic material for more ideas			0
' it 's clear that @entity2 's priority here is propagation of its radical sexual ideology , not protecting young girls ' safety			2

pro-life *non-profit* @entity13 sent investigators posing as minors to ask questions about the erotic *bestseller*
@entity2 staff used the book to explain @entity56 , and underline the importance of consent
