attack : the shooting appeared to be the latest in a series of attacks by members of the @entity3 security forces against their coalition partners @entity50 , which had been run by @entity67 troops , was one of the districts in @entity41 that last month transitioned , under much fanfare , from @entity5 to @entity3 security control			1
