speculation was growing last night that @entity2 mercenaries had been deployed to @entity3 after videos emerged of unidentified armed men in the streets of the eastern @entity8 city			1
at least two videos published on @entity10 earlier this week show burly , heavily armed soldiers with no insignia in the city , which has been gripped by @entity15 protests			2
in one of the videos onlookers can be heard shouting ' @entity18 ! @entity18 ! ' as the armed men , who wear no insignia , jog through the streets			1
a screengrab from a @entity10 video showing armed men on the streets of @entity3 , a largely @entity26 - speaking city in east @entity8 which has been the scene of large protests against the country 's new regime @entity3 was this week the scene of civil unrest as @entity34 elements among its citizens seized control of the regional administration headquarters and another government building			1
yesterday thousands of people gathered in the city centre waving @entity26 flags and calling for a referendum to determine the status of the strategically important coal - mining region			2
both the videos which purport to show ' @entity18 ' mercenaries in @entity3 were uploaded last monday , with their descriptions written in @entity26			1
the context of the videos is not clear , but it appears that the armed men had turned up at a street protest against the new regime			1
they wander around brandishing their weapons before suddenly fleeing the scene as passers - by shout ' @entity18 ! @entity18 ! ' both the videos which purport to show ' @entity18 ' mercenaries in @entity3 were uploaded last monday , with their descriptions written in @entity26			1
they could give @entity26 the pretext to invade the region the armed men hop down from the elevated position where some had been standing and make their exit since the videos emerged , @entity63 has been alive with speculation that mercenaries linked to @entity18 , now known as @entity18 , are active in @entity8 , helping to prop up the embattled new pro-western government			1
and a @entity26 diplomat in @entity69 told the @entity71 news agency on wednesday that 300 employees of private security companies had arrived there			1
' these are soldiers of fortune proficient in combat operations			0
most of them had operated under private contracts in @entity80 , @entity81 and other states , ' the source said			0
@entity71 reported that the diplomat did not disclose the nationalities of the mercenaries but said , ' most of them come from the @entity2 '			2
asked whether the soldiers seen in the videos could be from @entity18 , dr @entity89 , a security expert with the @entity90 , said : ‘ @entity91 to say really			0
it 's certainly not beyond the realm of possibility - @entity18 have been deployed in all sorts of theatres			0
' i think the question is whether the evidence available warrants at least reasonable speculation			0
‘ on the face of it , the uniforms of the people in the videos are consistent with @entity2 mercs - they do n't look like @entity26 soldiers mercs			2
on the other hand , why run around in public making a show of it ? ’ he added : ‘ of course the other possibility is it 's all @entity26 propaganda			0
’ any suggestion that a @entity2 mercenary outfit like @entity18 , known now as @entity18 , had begun operating in east @entity8 could give @entity26 president @entity115 the pretext for a military invasion as the armed men left the scene , suspicious bystanders could be heard yelling ' @entity18 ! @entity18 ! ' any suggestion that a @entity2 mercenary outfit like @entity18 had begun operating in the country could give @entity26 president @entity115 the pretext for a military invasion			1
the @entity26 parliament , the @entity125 , has already voted to give @entity115 the authority to take action in the country , where the @entity34 president @entity129 was last month ousted after mass protests in the capital , @entity69			1
pro-russian forces have already seized control of the southern @entity8 province of @entity135 , although the @entity136 denies that the thousands of heavily armed , well - equipped men that have appeared there are under its control			2
last month a report in the @entity141 claimed that ' informed sources ' in @entity143 had said the troops belong to @entity145 , a private security contracting bureau similar to @entity18 that is close to the @entity136			0
the videos which emerged this week come amid reports in @entity26 media which claimed that 300 ' strong ' men had arrived at @entity69 's @entity151 carrying military - style bags			1
reports speculated that they were being sent to regions in eastern and southern @entity8 where @entity26 - speaking and ethnic @entity26 groups posed a secessionary threat to the new government			2
@entity18 was founded in 1997 by former @entity158 @entity157 and were one of several private security firms employed by the @entity2 government to protect its diplomatic missions overseas			0
with the outbreak of the @entity80 war in 2003 the company 's operations expanded and its revenue mushroomed , but a string of controversial killings by its personnel led to a rebranding , first to @entity18 and then to @entity18 , its current name			0
as well as acting as security contractors , @entity18 are seen by some as a private army that can promote @entity2 interests without official military involvement			0
technically they are a multinational company and can by hired by anyone , but the board of directors includes a number of @entity2 establishment figures including @entity183 , the former attorney general , and former @entity186 chief @entity185			0
pro-russian demonstrators take part in a rally in central @entity3 earlier today : the eastern city is in part of @entity8 where the majority of the population are either @entity26 - speaking or ethnic @entity26 @entity26 ! help us : protesters hold signs in @entity197 calling for @entity26 intervention in the region no to @entity200 : a woman holds a sign decrying the trans - @entity204 alliance , while the @entity205 and @entity206 , the flag of the @entity208 , flies in the background at the @entity34 demonstration earlier today riot police stand guard in front of regional government building which was until thursday occupied by @entity34 activists , as demonstrations carry on outside if @entity18 are present in @entity8 , it would make most sense for them to be deployed in the country 's east and south , where @entity34 protesters raised the @entity26 flag over the regional parliament last saturday			1
it remained in place until thursday when @entity8 police regained control of the building without any resistance			0
@entity3 , home city of deposed president @entity129 , has seen the most persistent @entity15 demonstrations in a wave of protests that have erupted across southern and eastern cities			2
@entity235 contacted @entity18 for comment , but there was no reply .			0
