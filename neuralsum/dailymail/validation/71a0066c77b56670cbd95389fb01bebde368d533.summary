electrical giant @entity0 has been censured by the advertising watchdog for selling ultra-high definition televisions with bogus promises about extra clarity			0
the retailer claimed the smart @entity7 sets with @entity8 , starting at £ 849 , would allow customers to ' watch your favourite @entity11 movies in greater detail '			1
but the @entity14 has ruled that this was exaggerated and misleading because no @entity17 tv channel is yet broadcasting in @entity8			1
these broadcasts are currently only available via internet based subscription services such as @entity21			1
false claims : @entity0 - @entity0 claimed that the smart @entity7 sets , like the one pictured , would allow viewers to watch @entity11 movies in ' greater detail			1
' the @entity14 found this to be ' exaggerated and misleading ' as no @entity17 tv channel is broadcasting in @entity8 yet @entity0 - @entity0 said the @entity7 set has ' automatic upscaling ' to ensure images are sharper and clearer than on a normal @entity33 set manufacturers including @entity7 , @entity35 and @entity36 have spent millions of pounds developing the technology – said to be four times sharper than existing hd tv			1
@entity0 - @entity0 said the @entity7 set has ' automatic upscaling ' to ensure images are sharper and clearer than on a normal @entity33 set			2
as such , owners of the sets would see an improvement in picture quality regardless of whether the broadcast was in @entity8			1
an offer of a ' free trial ' of @entity50 's prime delivery service has been banned after the watchdog found the online retail giant misled consumers about subscription fees			0
the direct mailing sent to consumers with @entity50 accounts included a plastic card stating ' 30 - day free trial ' , information about the associated @entity60 and a letter			0
small text at the bottom of the letter said : ' paid subscription starts automatically after free trial unless cancelled			0
' six people complained that the ad was not sufficiently clear that a paid subscription would start automatically if not cancelled during the trial and did not state the cost of the subscription			0
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) said a paid subscription starting automatically at the end of the trial was a commitment and a significant condition of the ' free ' offer , and should therefore be made clear to consumers			2
but the @entity14 said the advert failed to give evidence of how effective this would be , although it accepted images may well be better on @entity7 sets			1
it said : ' we also considered viewers would understand that the improved quality was achieved because the televisions were ' @entity33 ' , that this particular technology was therefore used to achieve the image quality and that the image quality achieved was subsequently of full and genuine @entity8 quality			2
' because there was such limited native @entity90 available in the @entity17 , we understood that any improvement in quality in films or programmes watched over the @entity11 period was unlikely to be achieved by the use of @entity85 specifically			1
' it ruled the advertisement should not be repeated			0
the first ' @entity100 ' sets and services emerged in 2006 to be followed by a new generation of sharper still ' @entity103 in 2011 and then 3d televisions in 2013			2
since then , there has been the super slim oled screens that mean the sets can be hung on the wall like a work of art , together with curved screens claimed to improve viewing angles			0
and the innovations do not stop at @entity8 , as leading manufacturers are starting to demonstrate the new @entity114 , which are eight times sharper than conventional hd sets and will be arriving in stores within two years			2
@entity0 - @entity0 said there were only three complaints to the @entity14			0
a spokesman said : ' we will of course ensure future adverts are clear on this topic for customers			0
