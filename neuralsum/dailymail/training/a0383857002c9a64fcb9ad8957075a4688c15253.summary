a complicated week in the build - up to the race for the @entity10 saw them initially issue a detailed list of messages that would be prohibited from the race in @entity15 onwards			2
motor sport 's world governing body , however , backtracked on several of the guidelines following complaints from teams			2
@entity3 team principle @entity2 has accused @entity4 of using coded radio messages with difficulties still being posed by the highly complex technical systems and power units employed this year , the @entity10 relaxed their stance on that matter			1
but any form of coaching advice , such as where a driver was losing time , where to brake , how to corner quicker et cetera , remained banned			2
during the race at the @entity37 , and with @entity6 encountering problems with the battery in his car , at one stage he was told : ' avoiding exit kerbs may help the problem with the car			1
' @entity2 feels such a message contravened the new regulations as he said : ' we had no issues ( with the new radio rules ) on our side			1
@entity2 believes @entity4 used coded messages to help @entity6 in sunday 's @entity7 ' it just made us more busy listening to others to make sure they made no mistakes , like @entity4 twice with @entity6			1
' i think it was coded , but it is up to the @entity10 to investigate			2
it is not for me to investigate			0
' but it was a strange message			0
once was okay , but twice , three times ? you can doubt what exactly the car problem was			0

' there was quite a lot of management that needed to go on to help him with that			0
it was quite intermittent , the problem we had			0
' if there had been a full radio ban it would n't have made life easier , that 's for sure			0
' we spoke to @entity67 , we told him he 's got some reliability issues and that was why he was told to keep off the kerbs because that was causing damage to the battery for instance			0
' it 's finding that balance with this radio stuff			0
' @entity6 was encountering problems with the battery in his car , at one stage he was told : ' avoiding exit kerbs may help the problem with the car '			1
