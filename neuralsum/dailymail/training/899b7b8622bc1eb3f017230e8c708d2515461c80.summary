coming into the fight off the back of two losses in the lightweight bracket , former champion @entity2 will take the leap up a weight class , in what will be the five - round main event in his home town			1
' we had been contemplating the move to 170lb a lot , ' @entity2 told @entity22			2
' it is pretty tough to take the weight off sometimes			0
not having to cut weight will definitely be a positive			0
scroll down to watch videos @entity2 is moving up a division to fight @entity7 at welterweight @entity2 plans to return to lightweight in the future despite moving up to take on @entity32 ' i will be giving up a little strength and size , but i 've sparred with plenty of top 170 guys at our gym			1
i will be a little bit faster , quicker , agile and more athletic than the 170 guys			0
' for the first time , @entity2 , who usually has a size advantage over his counterparts at 155lbs , will be the smaller fighter in the @entity46 when he meets @entity7 at the @entity47			1
nevertheless , the @entity49 fighter insists that he will return to lightweight after the fight : ' this is not a permanent move to 170			2
i 'll be back at 155 , ' he said			0
' this was just me stepping up for an opportunity			0
there are some other 170 match - ups that interest me , but i 'm probably not staying at 170			0
' @entity7 , standing at 6 ' 2 ' , is also well aware of the size advantage that he will command inside the @entity46 : ' i 'm a bigger , longer fighter , ' he said			1
' i feel like as long as i keep him on the end of my jab and stay long , i 'll be successful in this fight			0
' @entity7 ( left ) is looking for his third win in succession since he joined the @entity4 a dynamic striker , @entity7 has dispatched his first two opponents since signing with the @entity4 , with finishes over @entity69 and @entity70 in the first round			2
in his 11 pro @entity49 bouts to date , @entity7 has competently finished each of his opponents in the opening round			2
and while headlining a fight card of this scale might present an added pressure for the 29 - year - old , he is confident that he can utilise this to his advantage			2
' being the main event in @entity83 â€“ it 's pressure but it 's good pressure and i do well under pressure			1
i 've fought many a time here as the main event in @entity83 so it 's nothing new to me			1
' where would a third straight win in the @entity4 take me ? you tell me where that would take me			0
if i keep winning in an impressive manner then the outcome is going to handle itself and i 'm going to continue to progress in this sport			0
