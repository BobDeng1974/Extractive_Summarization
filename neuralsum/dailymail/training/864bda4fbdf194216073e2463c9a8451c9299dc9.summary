cabinet papers released under the 30 - year rule show senior ministers in mrs @entity5 's government urged her not to waste public money on the ' stony ground ' of @entity16 , suggesting it would be like ' trying to make water flow uphill '			1

the outbreak of rioting in the rundown @entity9 district in july 1981 came amid a wave of disturbances in cities across @entity44			2
behind the scenes , ministers were divided on the best way to respond			2
@entity20 yesterday said he had no recollection of arguing for @entity2 to be allowed to decline , and suggested he may have been misquoted			1
he said it was a ' gross misunderstanding ' to suggest he wanted to abandon @entity2 , adding : ' i do n't recall how that argument got into the discussion at all			1
' it certainly does n't sound very considerate			0
' but certainly i think the chancellor is so often arguing against spending money as being the only answer			0
' @entity34 and i together introduced enterprise zones in @entity16 as well as in many other places which was a better way , if you like , of making help available as quickly as possible			1
' as a former @entity16 mp , i am surprised to find myself ever having argued quite as i am quoted to have done on @entity2			2
' but @entity64 politicians in the city seized on the papers as fresh evidence of a @entity0 bias against the city			0
council leader @entity70 said the suggestion of managed decline was ' absolutely shocking '			0
denial : @entity20 , left , and @entity34 , today said that abandoning @entity2 was ever really an option previously secret files reveal how @entity5 's conservative @entity76 struggled to deal with the worst outbreak of civil disorder since @entity80			1

@entity5 was secretly urged to abandon @entity2 to a fate of ' managed decline ' , it was revealed today prime minister @entity5 and industry secretary sir @entity98 at a press conference after a meeting with a @entity102 delegation at no. 10 @entity103 just as with the @entity87 2011 riots , the @entity104 of 1981 blamed the disorder on the rise of technology and the lack of decent parenting as rioting erupted just weeks before the @entity112 , @entity5 agreed to give police all the equipment they needed to maintain order			1
giving officers guns was better than having troops on @entity119 streets on the mainland for the first time			0
@entity122 said : ' if necessary the police should be properly equipped , and even armed , before such a step was taken			0
' the metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity126 was concerned about security arrangements for the @entity112 , he told the prime minister at the start of july			2
she went away with a list of equipment needed - from riot shields to protected vehicles , longer truncheons , ribber bullets , protective head gear and a water cannon			1
however , the trouble began to subside and calls for a new @entity140 were ignored			0
he said there were parallels with cuts to council funding in the city by the present government , adding : ' with the funding allocation we have got now , it certainly strengthens the argument that nothing has changed in 30 years			0
' that is the reality of what people in @entity2 feel now			2
' prominent former @entity64 mp @entity156 said : ' i frankly do not think they cared			0
' they thought they were electorally immune and did not anticipate what was to happen – a complete rejection of @entity163 not only in @entity2 but in other northern cities			2
' mr @entity156 accused the current government of reviving an alleged anti-northern bias , saying policies were ' deliberately contrived to make sure that there is “ stony ground on the banks of the @entity171 ” again '			0
@entity34 yesterday insisted the idea of abandoning @entity2 never really became an option			1
he was sent to the city to look at ways of improving the situation			0
he said : ' it never really got any traction for the simplest reason that the cabinet minister responsible for so much of the policy that affected the city was me			0
' i simply would n't countenance that you could say that one of @entity44 's great cities , a world city , was going into managed decline here			0
' that would simply be unthinkable to the approach that i believed to be necessary to a very important part of our history			0
' high security : @entity5 visits @entity2 in 1981 for talks with police and community leaders about the @entity9 riots burnt out : a building is destroyed by a blaze in the @entity82 riots in 1981 as disorder swept across @entity119 destroyed : firefighters pick through the remains of the @entity206 pub in @entity82 , south @entity87 after it was gutted in a huge blaze during riots in april 1981 a police officer , blood streaming from a head wound , is helped away by colleagues during rioting in @entity82 , south @entity87 in 1981 lifting the spirits of a nation , then and now : the royal wedding of @entity219 in 2011 - and ( top ) the marriage of @entity221 and lady @entity222 in 1981			1
