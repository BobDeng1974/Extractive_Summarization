by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 13:07 est , 15 february 2013 a disgraced carer who screamed ' i hate you ' at a dementia patient at the scandal - hit @entity5 is still working with elderly people			1
@entity8 roughly pulled the helpless 73 - year - old patient into the ward with his trousers round his ankles before launching a tirade of abuse at him			1
ms @entity15 , a qualified midwife who was working as a healthcare assistant , was struck off this week by the @entity17			1
but an alarming loophole in the system means she can still be a carer , because healthcare assistants are not officially regulated			1
a healthcare assistant who dragged a dementia patient half - naked from a toilet at the scandal - hit @entity5 is still working with the elderly during the incident in july 2010 , the @entity28 carer branded the patient ' an animal ' and told startled colleagues she could not tolerate dementia sufferers			1
she failed to turn up to the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) hearing this week , which banned her from ever working again in a qualified nursing or midwifery role			1
but the @entity17 had no power to ban her from taking another job as a healthcare assistant			1
in an email to the professional regulator , @entity15 wrote : ' i do n't want to practice as a midwife , i am quite happy to work as a carer only '			2
healthcare assistants are not regulated , although there are plans afoot to change this in light of the public inquiry into the @entity53 scandal			2
@entity17 chair @entity54 said : ' the panel was in no doubt that , on the facts found proved , ms @entity15 placed the patient at unwarranted risk of harm			1
' she has brought the profession into disrepute and breached fundamental tenets of the profession			0
' it was revealed @entity15 is now working @entity67 , a private establishment in @entity69 which charges its elderly and disabled patients up to Â£ 676 a week			2
the 41 - resident home is owned by the @entity72 of @entity73 , based in @entity74			0
it is thought she has now been suspended from @entity77 's in the light of the @entity17 case			2
@entity15 abused the patient while working at @entity5 on july 22 , 2010			2
patient a , who suffered from parkinson 's disease and @entity84 's , was found wandering the ward in a confused and agitated state at around 3.30am			2
ms @entity15 's former colleague @entity87 ( pictured ) told a misconduct hearing this week that @entity15 was ' out of control ' when dealing with the patient @entity15 was asked to take over his one - to - one care , but was soon seen by staff nurse @entity87 pushing him forcibly back down into his wheelchair			1
' ms @entity87 took patient a to the toilet and then went to answer a call bell ' , said @entity98 , for the @entity17			1
' when she returned she witnessed the registrant pulling patient a out of the toilet , pulling him by the collar of his pyjama top			0
' his trousers were around his ankles , his genitals exposed			0
' due to the aggression shown and the fact @entity81 had no dignity , staff nurse @entity108 intervened at that point , pulling patient a 's trousers up and assisted getting him back into the wheelchair			0
' ms @entity87 told the hearing @entity15 then became ' out of control ' , shouting abuse at patient a as he was led away			2
' she shouted : ' i hate him , i really hate him , he is like an animal , i ca n't bear working with him '' , ms @entity87 told the hearing			1
' @entity127 repeated her comments two or three times			0
it seemed @entity127 was becoming hysterical			0
' @entity15 's case is the first to be brought before an @entity17 misconduct panel since the publication of a damning report into standards at @entity5			2
the two - year inquiry , led by sir @entity137 , found ' failures at every level ' , including patient left lying in their own urine for days , forced to drink water from vases and sent home with life - threatening conditions			1
as many as 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily - though sir @entity137 had said the true figure will probably never be known			0
mr @entity54 said a finding of misconduct was inevitable given @entity15 shunned the @entity17 hearing and has offered no insight into her actions			1
' the panel has no evidence of an explanation , remorse , a genuine apology , remediation or insight , or any assurance from ms @entity15 that such behaviour would not happen again ' , he said			0
' therefore , the panel can not be satisfied mr @entity8 is highly unlikely to repeat her misconduct			0
' the panel considers she would be in the future liable to place patients in unwarranted risk of harm			0
' @entity15 was hired by the @entity173 in april 2009 while she was waiting for her midwifery registration to take effect in the @entity176			0
she was offered no training in handling aggressive dementia patients , and was allowed to continue working on the ward despite several incidents of abrupt behaviour towards patients and staff			0
workmates simply put her bad behaviour down to her poor grasp of the @entity188 language			0
' ms @entity15 , while not practicing as a registered midwife , was at the time of the incident , registered as a midwife with the @entity17 ' , said mr @entity54			1
' this made her subject to the code , with regards to her care for patients			0

@entity8 was a qualified midwife but working as healthcare assistant
dragged 73 - year - old patient around ward and screamed ' i hate you '
struck off as midwife this week after @entity17 hearing
but loophole means she can still be healthcare assistant ( @entity213 )
unlike nurses , @entity215 are not regulated , so anyone can work as one
