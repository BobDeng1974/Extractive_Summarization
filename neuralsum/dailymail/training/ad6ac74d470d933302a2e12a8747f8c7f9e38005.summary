by @entity0 scientist dr @entity1 has created a list of features he predicts humans could evolve			1
it includes tentacles , colour - changing skin , flexible skeletons and selective hearing			1
the neuroscientist humorously notes that as evolution takes so long no one will be around to see his his predictions are right or wrong			0
humans might one day evolve colour changing skin like the chameleon ( pictured ) according to one scientist 's musings on evolution taking inspiration from the chameleon , humans could evolve the ability to consciously change their skin colour , he wrote in a blog for @entity27			1
he muses that this could happen in humans evolved chomatophores - pigment - containing and light - reflecting organelles in cells found in reptiles - or even by using technology , but notes that whatever the case there are numerous evolutionary benefits			2
' being able to either visually blend in or stand out at will would be a potent advantage in modern society , one that evolutionary pressures could make more common , ' he said			2
dr @entity1 points out that humans already have the ability to focus their hearing on certain conversations and noises , but the human ear does not have a physical mechanism for doing this			1
will humans evolve tentacles like the squid pictured , to be able to interact with computers more easily ? he believes that over time selective hearing could become more important - perhaps to filter out increasing noise from social media and other sources of continuous information			1
' rather than diverting attention to more relevant inputs , humans could develop the ability to actively ' tune out ' things they do n't want to hear , like closing your eyes to block an unpleasant sight , ' he said			0
while this could result in humans taking in less information over all , dr @entity1 believes future humans might be less stressed and angry to live longer , happier lives			1
he said that in order for humans to use keyboards and touch screens to communicate with computers more easily , we could evolve more dexterous hands that allow us to make precise movements but are less rigid to help us type faster			0
as the world gets safer for most of us , there is less need for humans to have rigid and inflexible bones to withstand forceful impacts , says the scientist who thinks we could one day evolve flexible skeletons they could even end up more like ' tentacles like those on a sea anemone , ' he said			0
noting that there might be limited practical reasons for humans to develop tentacles , he humorously suggests that they could be used for sexual selection as an alternative method of arousal			0
humans could also develop more cartilage in their skeletons like sharks , which would have benefits such as being able to give birth more easily , he said			0
as the world gets safer for most of us , there is less need for humans to have rigid and inflexible bones to withstand forceful impacts			0
while dr @entity1 's suggestions for features that humans could evolve are just his own musings , new research has found that that humans could one day grow beaks			1
dr @entity120 , a biologist at @entity121 , believes that humans will evolve constantly developing teeth thanks to ' tooth fairy ' cells			2
he believes that human teeth are no longer fit for purpose and could even change into a beak that beak would not rot , chip or fall out .			0

dr @entity1 muses that humans could evolve surreal new features to cope with our modern *environment*
his *bizarre* suggestions include colour - changing skin to allow humans to stand out or blend in as well as tentacles to help us use computers better
the neuroscientist 's humorous ideas come after a researcher at the @entity121 predicted that humans will evolve beaks and *regenerating* teeth
