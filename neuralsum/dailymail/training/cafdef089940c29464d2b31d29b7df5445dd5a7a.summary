@entity1 boss @entity0 has urged people not to label striking sensation @entity3 after a stunning start to his career in @entity6			1
the 21 - year - old @entity7 has scored three times in as many @entity10 games , including winners against both @entity12 and @entity13 , to draw comparisons with @entity16 heroes such as @entity17 and @entity18			1
however , while he has been delighted with the youngster 's contribution to date , he is determined not to pile the pressure on him as he prepares to unleash him on @entity23 this saturday			2
@entity3 scores with an exquisite back - heel against @entity25 in @entity1 's last @entity10 game @entity3 celebrates his goal against @entity25 as @entity1 go on to record a fifth straight win @entity0 said : ' at the moment , he 's fearless			1
he 's got the wind in his sails and is going along very nicely			2
he 's been very sharp in training			2
' if you take your eye off him , he 's a predator			2
i 'm sure @entity23 will be having conversations of how to look after him			2
he 's difficult to pin down , his movement is very clever			2
' but he is a young player			0
some of the headlines have been way off the mark - the new @entity17 , the new @entity18			1
' this is a boy who has played three games			1
those players are legends and have done it all			0
@entity3 is just setting foot in the @entity10			1
@entity3 scored the only goal of the game as @entity1 beat @entity13 at @entity52 in november the 21 - year - old is congratulated by @entity54 after scoring the winning goal against @entity13 ' but i have to say , he 's done really well so far			1
i 'm pleased with him			0
' @entity3 , a £ 1.5million summer signing from @entity59 , has got his chance because of an injury to @entity62 with the @entity63 having decided not to sign a big - name frontman during the close - season			1
he was seen as a player for the future , but the impact he has made to date has been remarkable after settling in with a little help from skipper @entity70			0
@entity0 said : ' he 's a nice , bright boy			1
because of the language , @entity71 has taken him under his wing			0
that 's helped him settle quickly			0
' he 's a smashing player and is low - maintenance			1
we 're enjoying him on the training ground			0
' @entity3 is mobbed by his team - mates as they celebrate in front of the @entity1 fans during the @entity13 win the @entity7 also scored the winner as @entity1 beat @entity12 2 - 1 at @entity83 in october if @entity0 has found a solution at one end of the pitch , he is having to be inventive at the other end too with @entity70 definitely sidelined by a calf problem this weekend and @entity89 also struggling			1
as a result , left - back @entity90 will line up the in the middle once again alongside the fit - again @entity94 , and his manager will have no qualms about him doing so			1
he said : ' he 's been a player that the fans were slow to respond to			0
for us , we 've always felt he had a massive chance because of his defensive abilities			0
they 've really come to the fore in this run , either at left - back or centre - back			1
@entity70 , pictured challenging @entity106 , is out of saturday 's clash against @entity23 with a calf injury ' he 's got a tough job on saturday			0
he will play centre - back and will be up against two strikers really on their game			2
this will be a big test for him			0
' but i 'm not going to lose any sleep over it , i 'm confident he can deal with it , and i could n't pay him a higher tribute than that			0
' @entity0 also moved to address claims from @entity124 that midfielder @entity125 had been told to find another club after being diagnosed with testicular cancer			1
@entity90 is likely to partner @entity94 in the centre of defence against @entity23 the 31 - year - old is due back on @entity131 within the next few weeks after winning his battle , and the manager insists he will be welcomed with open arms			1
he said : ' it 's difficult , when you 've said to a player to get a new club and unfortunately the illness has come			0
' you try to be supportive , but of course , the player wants to find a bit more assurance than that			0
' but that decision was a 100 per cent football decision			0
i want to invite @entity125 back and give him the best possible chance when he returns			0

@entity3 *joined* @entity1 from @entity59 in the summer for £ 1.5m
the 21 - year - old has scored in his last three @entity10 games
it has led to comparisons to @entity17 and @entity18
but @entity0 has described them as ' way off the mark '
