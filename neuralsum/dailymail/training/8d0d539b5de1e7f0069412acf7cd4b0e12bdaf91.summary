by @entity0 for @entity1 a self - styled adventurer is to spend a year living on a melting iceberg off the coast of @entity5 to try to draw attention to climate change			1
in spring next year @entity8 , 36 , will find a suitable iceberg off the north west of @entity5 where he will remain until it melts			1
he hopes his stunt will raise awareness of the impact of global warming , which the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) recently warned is ' widespread and consequential '			0
mr @entity8 , who is from northern @entity33 but is based in the @entity34 , has already run more than 14,000 miles worth of marathons , and rowed solo across the @entity37 and @entity36			1
but his one - man global warming campaign could be his most - difficult yet			0
he will live in a @entity40 - reinforced survival capsule provisioned with 661lbs of dried food			1
he will be mostly alone , but for periods of the year hopes to invite writers and broadcasters to stay to raise awareness			2
his equipment will be powered by a rowing machine - powered generator , which will allow him to keep in touch with the outside world without contributing to global warming himself			0
when the iceberg becomes too dangerous to remain on , he will cast off into the ocean , drifting aboard his capsule until he is rescued			1
he told @entity55 : ' my objective is reporting and investigating , by means of scientific methods , the entire lifetime of an iceberg			2
i want to prove how the pace of ice - melting has dramatically accelerated over the last decades			0
' we ’ll also play the symbolic card : the adventure of a man floating adrift on an iceberg will come to represent the condition of the whole humankind going adrift on an endangered planet			0
' mr @entity8 says his goal is to encourage others to take action as well			2
in a @entity76 video where he outlines his plans he says : ' on the iceberg , i will be generally alone , but for short periods of time i will be meeting with writers , bloggers , environmentalists … ' i dream that this will become the era of responsibility , where each of us can take on his version of responsibility to try to reverse this trend			1
' but he said that his aim is not to be labelled as a new kind of environmentalist , telling @entity96 : ' i am and will always be an explorer			0
' in this new mission i wish to become the bridge between the researchers and the rest of the world , and i hope i will help all those who will follow the adventure understanding the urgent need for action and for a greater sense of responsibility			0

@entity8 will find an iceberg in @entity5 and live on it until it melts
he will survive the ordeal *inside* a @entity40 capsule , eating only dried food
most of the time he will be alone , but he will sometimes be *joined* by writers
