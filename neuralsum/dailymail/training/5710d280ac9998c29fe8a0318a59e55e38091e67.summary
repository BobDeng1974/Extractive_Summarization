' forced out ' : @entity0 , 51 , is suing @entity1 for £ 1 million in lost earnings a senior @entity1 executive was forced out of his job because he blew the whistle on ' shocking ' failures in the bank ’s it systems that would have cost £ 200 million to fix , a tribunal has heard			1
@entity0 , 51 , the former head of the business continuity at @entity1 , alleges there was a deliberate cover - up to stop the flaws being dealt with due to the cost of repairing the problem and the potential damage to the bank 's reputation			1
mr @entity0 claims he discovered ' startling ' failures in the bank ’s @entity20 back - up system that left the bank vulnerable to failures that could bring it down			1
the problems were so severe they threatened to ' destabilise the @entity29 economy ' , it was said today			0
but he said that when he tried to flag up the worrying deficiencies to his boss last march he was told to ' burn the paper ' it was written on and the issue was effectively buried			1
mr @entity0 says he was forced from his job as the senior executive in charge of protecting @entity1 ’ systems from crises just four months after raising his concerns			1
he had already been warned he could be moved to another post , and he alleges the unwanted move was because of his age and the boss ’s desire to replace him with a woman			2
the bank denies his allegations			2
the father - of - three from @entity52 , who earned £ 130,000 a year in pay and benefits , is suing the bank for £ 1 million in lost earnings			1
he alleged whistleblowing and sex and age discrimination			0
in documents submitted to the @entity62 , the 51 - year - old said he was ' startled ' to discover that only a third of the bank ’s systems had undergone crucial testing , leaving ' very serious gaps in our ability to recover critical it systems '			1
mr @entity0 said the failure to undertake the risk assessments could have a potentially catastrophic impact on the country ’s economy			2
he said the impact would dwarf a similar glitch at the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) last june that left millions of customers unable to access their accounts			0
he said : ' the @entity1 issues are much bigger and could potentially send the bank out of business , thereby destabilising the @entity29 economy			2
i raised a really serious concern			0
' however , when he told his boss @entity87 , director of group security and fraud , about his fears in an email in march 2012 , he claimed the executive ' took great exception ' and told him to ' burn the paper and never bring it out again ’			1
' failings ' : mr @entity0 claims to have discovered deficiencies in @entity1 's it back - up system mr @entity0 added : ' effectively this issue was buried			1
@entity87 had responsibility for ensuring these [ assessments ] were carried out			0
the statistic that only 37 per cent of systems had a @entity103 ( business impact assessment ) completed is both startling and shocking			0
' it was the responsibility of information risk to ensure that these essential risk assessments were being carried out and it had failed to do so			0
' mr @entity0 claims he repeatedly wrote to his manager urging him to tell other senior executives of the urgent need to strengthen these security tests			1
but when he confided his fears in another senior employee at @entity1 , mr @entity0 claims he was told that top executives at the state bailed out bank were engaged in a cover up because they feared the cost of rectifying the problem would cost a staggering £ 200million			1
in his statement he said @entity121 , a peer of mr @entity87 and equally responsible for @entity20 at @entity1 , told him of the cover up			2
he said she ' told me that if she had escalated this issue up the line , she ' would lose [ her ] job ’ because @entity128 ( director of operations ) , @entity130 ( @entity131 ) and @entity132 wanted the problem ' covered up ’ , not only because of the potential cost to remedy the problems ( over £ 200m ) but also because of the extensive damage to the public ’s confidence in the bank			1
' potential : mr @entity0 said the impact would dwarf a similar glitch at the @entity77 last june a @entity1 employee for more than 20 years , mr @entity0 was a successful executive with a string of achievements to his name			2
but he claims his job turned sour in 2011 and believes his boss was scheming to out him from his job so he could give it to a woman , @entity149 , who mr @entity87 had worked with at @entity77			2
mr @entity0 alleges he was ordered by mr @entity87 to place miss @entity149 as his possible successor on an internal document - despite major concerns about her lack of experience			1
former employee : the former head of the business continuity earned £ 130,000 a year in his statement he said : ' in april 2011 @entity87 instructed me to include @entity149 ’s name against my name / role in the 0 - 2 years column			1
' i replied that i did not think she was ready to take over in my role within that time			0
@entity132 leant across the table and said aggressively ' i will be the judge of that ’			0
that was the end of the conversation and her name was duly included			0
' nine months later in his yearly assessment meeting on january 5 2012 , mr @entity0 claims his boss subjected him to a litany of ageist comments and told him : ' it is difficult for you because you are not 25 anymore ' and ' you have been here too long '			1
he claims mr @entity87 then told him he wanted to remove him from his post within the next two months and get in a ' fresh pair of eyes ' to take up his job			2
following two failed grievance hearings against his boss , mr @entity0 resigned in july last @entity181 and mr @entity87 strongly deny any wrongdoing and insist that mr @entity0 was treated properly			1
in a statement mr @entity87 said : ' i categorically deny any suggestion that i have treated @entity186 detrimentally on the basis of his gender or his age and there is no truth in @entity186 ’s suggestion that i ought to replace him with @entity193			0
' i further strongly refute any suggestion that @entity186 has been treated to his detriment by me or @entity1 in any way as a result of either raising a grievance , filing litigation or raising concerns surrounding the @entity20 report			0
' i am very regretful that the situation has come to this			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' we take the continuous provision of service to our customers very seriously			0
' as this is the subject of an ongoing employment tribunal it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time			0
' the tribunal continues .			0
