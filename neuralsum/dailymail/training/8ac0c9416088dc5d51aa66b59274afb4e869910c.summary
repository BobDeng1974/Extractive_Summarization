by @entity0 published : 00:07 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 14:28 est , 14 august 2012 @entity1 had a rocky first solo day of campaigning since joining @entity5 ’s presidential ticket when he had to cut a speech short after hecklers interrupted him at the @entity8			1
he had spent only a few moments on the soapbox when several hecklers began shouting about his proposed @entity13 reforms , two of whom attempted to jump on the stage with him			0
attempting to brush off the interruption by bonding with the crowd over his @entity20 roots , congressman @entity1 tried to move past the issue as three people were eventually escorted out of the area by state police			1
these ladies must not be from @entity8 or @entity44 , ’ he said to the crowd			1
when one of the female protesters tried to get on the stage , @entity1 appeared startled - ‘ hey , alright ! ’ he said - before the remainder of the crowd urged him on with chants of ‘ @entity51 ! @entity51 ! ’ in spite of his efforts to get back on track , @entity1 did end up speaking for only 12 minutes instead of the customary 20 minutes			0
a spokesman from the @entity56 told @entity57 that none of the three hecklers were removed from the fair , simply from the area where @entity1 was speaking , and none of them were arrested			0
@entity1 ’s visit to the @entity8 was his first solo campaign event following a weekend of joint appearances following the announcement of his selection as the @entity70 vice presidential candidate on saturday			2
the move comes as little surprise since @entity73 is a pivotal swing state that was won by president @entity75 in 2008			1
waiting his turn : @entity1 briefly paused as the two women ( and one male heckler ) were escorted out of the area taken out : @entity56 confirmed that three people - including these two women - were removed from the area but none of them were arrested and they were allowed to stay at the fair during their interview with @entity84 on sunday , @entity5 and @entity1 said that they would be spending much of the campaign apart in an effort to double their forces and cover more ground			1
@entity5 said that the addition of @entity1 to the ticket was a way to even the playing field as he has been campaigning by himself against president @entity75 and vice president @entity95 up until now			1
in that same vein , @entity1 and @entity75 battled it out for coverage today as they were both in @entity8 and though they did not run into each other at any point , they made a point to pass messages through their supporters			1
‘ as you see the president come through in his bus tour , you might ask him the same question that i 'm getting asked from people all around @entity51			0
and that is , “ where are the jobs , mr. president ? ” ’ @entity1 said after the furvor died down as the hecklers were removed			0
the president spent much of his time in the state looking at the damage caused by the continuing drought and talking to some of the state ’s many farmers about the proposed plan to use $ 170million in federal aid to provide short - term relief to those impacted by the record - breaking heat			2
popular state : president @entity75 began his bus tour in @entity8 on the same day and focused his rhetoric on a proposed bill that would provide $ 170m in assistance to drought - riddled farmers introducing himself : @entity1 tried to connect with fair - goers over their shared @entity20 roots in keeping with his strategy of painting @entity1 as a @entity70 ‘ idealogue ’ that has prevented @entity140 compromise , @entity75 talked about the opposition that the bill faces in @entity140			1
‘ i ’m told gov. @entity5 's new running mate might be around @entity8 these next few days , and he 's one of those leaders of @entity140 standing in the way , ’ @entity75 said			1
‘ so if you happen to see congressman @entity1 , tell him how important this farm bill is to @entity73 and our rural communities			0
we 've got to put politics aside and do right thing for rural @entity51 and @entity8			2
’ considering @entity1 ’s @entity20 roots - and the importance of the swing state - the @entity8 comes as a predictable first outing for the @entity1			2
the fair has also had a special place in the @entity5 campaign ’s timeline , as it was at the same event last year when the former governor made the much - publicized comment that ‘ corporations are people too , my friend ’			0
during his brief interaction with fairgoers as he walked to and from the stage , he highlighted his interest in similar activities			0
‘ we do cow milking contests in @entity44 , ’ @entity1 said			0
he said that he also enjoyed watching demolition derbies			0

@entity5 's *vp* pick *stumped* in @entity8 on *monday* and was interrupted
tried to brush past the heckler 's interruption but still cut speech short
president @entity75 was also visiting @entity8 on same day
