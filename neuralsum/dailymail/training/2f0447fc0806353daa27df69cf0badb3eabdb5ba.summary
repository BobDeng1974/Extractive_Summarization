a moose decided it wanted to join the party when it took a dip in a private swimming pool at a holiday villa			2
the group of holidaymakers were shocked when they spotted the beast swimming a few lengths of the pool in @entity11 , @entity12 , before relaxing in the shallow end			1
the creature looked like it was having a whale of a time as the party panicked about how it was going to get out of the pool and more importantly , if they would have the poolside to themselves again			0
the enormous animal managed to gracefully clamber out , carefully stepping over the poolside deckchairs as it made an effort not to crush anything			0

as the 7ft high moose tries to clamber out of the pool , the stunned filmmakers can be heard saying worryingly : ' do we have moose insurance ? ' when faced with the closed wooden poolside gate , the moose appears to stop and ponder for a moment - before elegantly stepping right over it , gingerly stepping down the stairs , then heading back off into the forest			2
cooling off : the moose decides it is time to get out of the pool at the villa graceful : the party panicked about how the moose was going to get out of the pool and more importantly , if they would have the poolside to themselves again relaxed : the moose ponders at the side of the swimming pool before making his journey back to the forest you looking at me : the moose made the most of his time at the holiday villa			0
