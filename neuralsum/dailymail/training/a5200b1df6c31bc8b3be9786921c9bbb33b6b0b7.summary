the secret of a squirrel ’s hibernation could hold the key to preventing @entity4 ’s			1
other devastating conditions , from @entity6 ’s to @entity7 ’s could also be avoided or delayed , thanks to a @entity10 breakthrough			1
scientists from the @entity12 in @entity13 have shown how a deep hibernation - like sleep cools down the brain and protects it from degenerative diseases			1
a deep hibernation - like sleep cools down the brain and protects it from degenerative diseases such as @entity4 's ( pictured ) and other devastating conditions such as @entity6 ’s and @entity7 ’s disease the discovery could lead to a drug that stops a host of crippling illnesses in their tracks			1
given in middle age , it could keep the brain healthy for longer			1
the work is still at an early age but @entity4 ’s charities described it as exciting and said it could have ‘ wide - reaching benefits ’			1
researcher @entity38 got the idea for her research after hearing what happens to the squirrel ’s brain when it hibernates			1
when the animal ’s body temperature drops to conserve energy during its long winter slumber , connections between brain cells are broken			2
this stops messages being sent from cell to cell and helps put the brain into a deep sleep			1
when the creatures come out of hibernation , the cell to cell connections , called synapses , reform , and work so perfectly that the squirrel can remember exactly where it hid its stash of nuts			2
older people with memory problems can boost their brainpower with fish oil supplements , say researchers			0
healthy people with mild memory deficits of events in their past life , so - called episodic memory , had improved recall after six months of treatment			2
a new overview says the omega - 3 fatty acid @entity80 has most benefit for people with existing memory problems , particularly when they are coping with physical or mental stress			2
experts believe supplements rich in @entity80 from fish oils or other marine sources might slow or prevent mental decline as it is found in reduced amounts in people with @entity4 ’s disease			2
dr @entity93 , independent public health nutritionist who reviewed the latest evidence for supplements manufacturer @entity95 , said oily fish consumption was falling			0
with broken synapses a classic early feature of neurodegenerative diseases in people , professor @entity38 decided to see if she too could fix them			0
to mimic the effects of hibernation , she took healthy mice and gave them a drug that cooled them down to the 16 - 18c of a hibernating squirrel and put them in a deep sleep			1
the synapses in the mouse brains broke up – then reformed when the creatures were warmed up again			0
crucially , levels of a protein called @entity116 rose			0
in contrast , mice in the very early stages of an @entity4 ’s - like illness were unable to reform their synapses when coming out of ‘ hibernation ’			1
and they did not make more @entity124			0
however , when these mice were given an injection that raised levels of @entity116 , the brain connections reformed			0
the improvement was even more dramatic in mice genetically engineered to succumb to a @entity132 - like illness			0
these animals remained healthy – and even lived longer than usual			2
together , the experiments show @entity116 to fix broken synapses – something that should keep brain cells alive			0
if @entity116 also keeps human synapses healthy , a drug that increases levels could keep @entity4 ’s and other degenerative diseases at bay			1
professor @entity143 , a @entity12 neuroscientist , said : ‘ we now need to find something to reproduce the effect of brain cooling			0
the discovery could lead to a drug that stops a host of crippling illnesses in their tracks - and given in middle age , it could keep the brain healthy for longer ‘ just as anti-inflammatory drugs are preferable to cold baths in bringing down a high temperature , we need to find drugs which can induce the effects of hibernation			1
’ the researchers caution that such drugs are a long way off			0
but say if they work , it may be possible to give them from middle - age to delay or even prevent a range of crippling brain diseases , including dementia			1
the discovery , reported in the journal nature , also helps explain why medically - induced hypothermia protects the brain			2
for instance , artificial cooling is used to prevent brain damage in babies deprived of oxygen at birth			0
dr @entity181 , of @entity182 , said : ‘ this research is at an early stage and will need exploring further in humans before we know whether it could be developed into an effective treatment for diseases like @entity4 ’s			0
‘ there is currently a desperate lack of effective treatment options for people with dementia			0
‘ research to uncover the key biological mechanisms keeping brain cells healthy is important , as it provides more avenues for investigation in the search for treatments that could make a real difference to people ’s lives			1

secret of a squirrel ’s hibernation could hold the key to preventing disease
deep hibernation - like sleep cools down brain , protecting from degeneration
@entity216 could lead to a drug that stops a host of illnesses tracks
given in middle age , it could keep the brain healthy for longer
other conditions , from @entity6 's to @entity7 's could also be helped
