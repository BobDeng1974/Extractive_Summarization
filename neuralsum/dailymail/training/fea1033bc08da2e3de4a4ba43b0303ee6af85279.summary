@entity0 is making waves in the drinks industry embarrassment levels following a very drunken office party could be about to get even worse			2
two of the spirits most likely to make us dance on a table and attempt @entity9 on karaoke have been combined into one lethal drink			0
vodka and tequila are now available together in one bottle			0
that 's right , @entity0 is here and it 's coming to the @entity17 on @entity18 soon			0
the next time you find yourself hugging the porcelain bowl , the people responsible could be @entity23 and his daughter @entity24			0
the pair came across the idea when @entity28 was mixing one of his evening cocktails at home in @entity32 , @entity33			0
his daughter @entity24 asked why he had never tried to combine his two favourite drinks - vodka and tequila - and the booze revolution was born			1
the drink tasted good enough for them to take the idea seriously			0
first of all , @entity24 developed it as a project during college , then afterwards her brother @entity44 joined the team and they started to look at is as a serious business plan that could do well in the @entity48 drinks market			1
@entity49 and his daughter @entity24 came up with the idea to mix tequila and vodka into one hybrid when he spent an evening making cocktails at their @entity33 home			1
they put the mix through a proper distilling process that resulted in a product good enough for @entity48 brand @entity61 ’s to place on supermarket shelves			1
the vodka is distilled six times , while the tequila is made from @entity65 , the two drinks are then blended together in small vats , macerated together at a high temperature to achieve a smooth blend			2
and while it possibly wo n't do much for your stomach the following morning , the tipple is making waves in the drinks industry - it won a silver medal at this year 's prestigious @entity77			1
the @entity77 is seen as a very prestigious event in the world of alcohol tasting co-founder of @entity83 , @entity81 said : ' it was actually my sister who came up with the vodka and tequila idea			1
' my dad and i thought there was definitely a space in the market for a new spirit and so we decided to pursue it - it sure has taken off from there ! @entity97 , general manager of the @entity77 was impressed the by taste of @entity0 ' i believe @entity61 ’s @entity0 has had so much success because it gives you the best of both worlds			1
' it ’s a huge achievement for us to have won an award in this year ’s @entity77 as it is recognised as one of the oldest and most prestigious spirit and wine competitions in the world			1
' the combination made such a stir at the awards that they are now seriously considering a new section of the competition just for hybrid alcohols			0
@entity97 , general manager of the @entity77 said : ' @entity116 initially intrigued the @entity77 judges in the blind tasting , but the spirit proved it ’s no gimmick when it was awarded a @entity120			2
' this is a whole new world of innovation in the spirits industry			0
' it 's outstanding that something initially created for a college project can make such an impact on the spirits market by creating a new category of its own			0
' it ’s affordable too , great for mixing in both classic tequila & vodka cocktails			2

father and daughter from @entity48 came up with the idea to mix liquors
