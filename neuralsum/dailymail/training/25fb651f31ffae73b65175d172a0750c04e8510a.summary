condemned : @entity0 , 45 , was put to death in @entity2 wednesday for killing his common - law wife @entity3 and her brother @entity5 a @entity2 death row inmate convicted of killing his former common - law wife and her brother more than two decades ago in @entity9 was executed by lethal injection wednesday evening			1
@entity0 's death sentence was carried out about 90 minutes after the @entity13 @entity12 rejected his last - day appeals			1
he had contended he had poor legal help at his trial and questioned the potency of the execution drug			2
@entity0 repeatedly expressed love to witnesses - both people he selected and relatives of his victims , @entity23 and @entity5 - and several times asked for forgiveness as he was about to be executed			2
‘ i love you all , ’ he said			0
‘ i 'm going home , going to be with the @entity28			0
... find it in your hearts to forgive me			0
’ as the lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital kicked in , he closed his eyes and breathed quietly			0
after about eight breaths , he opened his mouth to exhale , then closed it			0
there was no further movement			0
@entity0 , 45 , was pronounced dead at 6.35pm central standard time - 22 minutes after the injection began			1
since @entity2 has struck down the tradition of offering death row inmates special meals before execution , @entity0 had the same dinner as everyone else in his unit : baked chicken , green beans , mashed potatoes , bread , and a choice of tea , punch , or water			1
his was the eighth lethal injection this year in @entity2 , and the first in the nation 's most active death penalty state since recent executions went awry in @entity60 and @entity61			1
unlike those states , where a drug combination is used for capital punishment , @entity2 uses a single lethal dose of pentobarbital			0
he became the second death row inmate executed in the @entity13 on wednesday			1
@entity68 received a lethal injection just after midnight in @entity70 for a 1998 robbery and double murder			1
after @entity0 's execution , relatives of his victims released a statement saying they were relieved justice was ‘ finally served all these years later			1
@entity0 had acknowledged shooting @entity93 , 24 , and her brother , @entity5 , 28 , at their parents ' home in @entity9			2
but @entity0 said the may 1993 shootings were accidental and in self - defense , and not worthy of a death sentence			2
prosecutors said he had threatened to kill @entity93 , who had a protective order against him , if she did n't return to him			0
they said he carried out that threat when barging into the house and opening fire			0
@entity0 's attorneys had argued to the @entity12 that lawyers at his 1993 trial were deficient for not addressing his self - defense theory and for failing to produce sufficient testimony about @entity0 's abusive childhood with an alcoholic mother			1
state attorneys scoffed at the argument , saying @entity0 's self - defense claim was absurd and had been rejected in earlier appeals			1
first to go : @entity0 became the second death row inmate executed in the @entity13 wednesday after @entity68 received a lethal injection in @entity70 just after midnight @entity0 's attorneys also contended the dose of pentobarbital for his lethal injection was past its effectiveness date and could subject him to unconstitutional ‘ tortuous ’ pain			1
the state responded that the drug does n't expire until the end of the month and that tests showed proper potency			0
they argued the appeal seeking details of the drug was merely another attempt to force prison officials to disclose the compounding pharmacy that provides the execution drugs , something the courts repeatedly have refused to order			0
investigators have said that @entity0 called his 24 - year - old ex-wife may 3 , 1993 , and renewed an earlier death threat			1
they said he then showed up at her parents ' house and opened fire with a semi-automatic pistol			0
@entity5 , 29 , also had a gun and wounded @entity0 , who then cornered his ex-wife in a bedroom and shot her 11 times before returning to the wounded brother and shooting him twice execution style in the back of the head as at least two young children watched , according to investigators			2
@entity0 drove himself to a hospital , where police arrested him .			2

@entity0 , 45 , drew his last breath just before 6.35pm *cdt* - 22 minutes after lethal injection began
@entity0 had a last meal of baked chicken , green beans , mashed potatoes and bread
@entity170 has been convicted of shooting dead his former common - law wife , @entity3 , and her brother , @entity173 , on may 3 , 1993
the execution came after @entity13 @entity12 rejected @entity0 's last - ditch appeals
he became second death row inmate to be executed wednesday , following @entity179 who was put to death in @entity70 around midnight
