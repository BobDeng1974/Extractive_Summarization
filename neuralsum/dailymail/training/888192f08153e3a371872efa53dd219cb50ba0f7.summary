by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 16:39 est , 3 october 2013 air fares could rise by up to £ 28 after @entity2 and @entity3 were given leave to push up the charges levied on airlines			1
the @entity7 yesterday revealed its final proposals on how much the main @entity10 airports can increase fees on carriers using their space until 2019			1
the regulator said that @entity2 charges should not rise by more than the @entity17 rate of inflation each year , currently 3.3 per cent			1
the @entity3 formula for the same period should be @entity17 plus 0.5 per cent			1
rise : passengers in @entity3 and @entity2 face higher fares after the airports were allowed to raise fees anger : @entity25 claims that all passengers could have to pay an extra £ 28 for their flights it calculated that the extra charge per passenger would be around £ 14 at @entity2 by 2019 and £ 3 at @entity3			1
but @entity25 warned that the extra cost for passengers would be far higher if an extra runway was built at @entity3 as it would need to be paid for			1
chief executive @entity37 said : ‘ using @entity3 ’s own figures , passengers could be paying £ 28 more per flight for years in advance of the opening of a new £ 9 billion runway			1
’ she claimed ‘ the lack of regulatory control of a proposed second runway ’ has ‘ handed @entity3 a licence to print money ’			2
the move has also ‘ significantly enhanced the value ’ of @entity3 to its owners , private infrastructure fund @entity47 , in the event of a likely future sale , she added			2
however , the row also came as booming budget airline @entity25 announced it now expects annual profits of between £ 470million and £ 480million , against £ 317million a year earlier , and said revenues per seat were also expected to grow by around six per cent on the back of strong passenger demand			1
complaint : bosses at @entity2 , pictured , said they may have to cut back on future investment above inflation : the @entity7 has allowed @entity3 to raise its fees by @entity17 plus 0.5 per cent every year to 2019 @entity62 said : ‘ it is deeply disappointing the @entity7 has bowed to pressure from @entity2			1
’ the airline added that the rises would be ‘ a hammer blow for @entity70 consumers and overseas visitors ’ as well as deterring foreign investment			0
fees at @entity2 are triple the level of ten years ago , leaving travellers with ‘ some of the highest charges in the world ’ , it said			1
it 's the bane of travellers crossing continents , but scientists may be a step closer to a cure for jet lag			0
they have identified a hormone thought to master the body ’s rhythm and so stop the brain from rapidly adjusting to new time zones			0
mice which had been genetically modified so the compound vasopressin failed to work were able to deal much better with time shifts			0
they almost instantly adjusted to an eight - hour jump whereas normal mice took eight to ten days			0
the breakthrough at @entity97 , @entity98 , raises the prospect of a pill to suppress vasopressin after a flight			0
but the benefits could be much wider , reported the journal @entity105			0
it could help shift workers cut health risks by adjusting more quickly to their schedules as well as improving the sleep of the elderly and those with dementia			0
@entity115 boss @entity114 said : ‘ it is a bad day for our customers who have been let down by the @entity7			2
’ he claimed the deal allows ‘ complacent ’ bosses at @entity2 ‘ to ignore its inefficiencies and over-reward investors ’			2
@entity123 , chief executive of @entity70 , which represents more than 75 scheduled airlines , joined the criticism			0
‘ airline chief executives will be reaching for their oxygen masks in the knowledge they will be forced to pass on excessive charges to customers , ’ he said			0
carriers want lower charges because of other pressures on fares , such as fuel costs			0
but the airports said the @entity7 deal does not go far enough and could jeopardise investment			2
@entity2 chief executive @entity139 wanted a 4.6 per cent rise each year above inflation			2
he warned the settlement ‘ could have serious and far - reaching consequences ’			0
mr @entity139 added : ‘ the @entity7 ’s proposals risk not only @entity2 ’s competitive position but the attractiveness of the @entity70 for international investment			1
’ the plans were given ‘ a cautious welcome ’ by @entity3 chief executive @entity149			2
@entity2 , @entity3 and @entity150 are the only airports to have charges regulated			1
a @entity7 proposal for @entity150 is expected next week			0
a final ruling on all three airports is due in january			0
@entity3 chief executive @entity149 said : ‘ the @entity7 ’s proposal to take forward our commitments framework would deliver an improved future outcome for passengers in terms of service quality , facilities and price			1
’ caution : @entity62 urged @entity2 for restraint pointing out that fees have tripled in a decade			1

@entity7 allows @entity2 to raise fees at the rate of inflation and @entity3 to hike charges at inflation plus 0.5 *%*
@entity25 claims all flights out of @entity3 could cost £ 28 more
@entity62 says @entity2 's prices are among the world 's highest
but airport bosses insist they need more funding to boost investment
