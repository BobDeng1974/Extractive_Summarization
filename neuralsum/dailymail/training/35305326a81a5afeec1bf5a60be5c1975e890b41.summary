@entity1 , marketed as @entity1 , can extend the lives of late - stage cancer sufferers by more than three months			2
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) had originally rejected the drug , which costs around £ 3,000 a month , for not being cost effective			2
it provoked an angry response from both patients and cancer charities			2
however , today it revised its recommendations after the manufacturer @entity19 offered the tablet at a lower undisclosed price			0
if @entity11 gives final approval to the drug it will have to be offered by the @entity8 in @entity5 and @entity6 from june			1
however , in a reverse of the usual trend the drug wo n't be available in @entity28			1
in march the @entity29 turned the drug down saying the cost of abiraterone did not justify the health benefits			1
this decision could change as it is still in talks with @entity19			0
the new draft guidance has been welcomed by experts			0
@entity37 , chief executive of @entity38 , said : ' this announcement represents a resounding triumph for each of the thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer in @entity5 and @entity6 who know just how much the prospect of precious extra time with their loved ones really means			1
' although today marks a very welcome advancement , it has to be remembered that abiraterone remains out of reach to men in @entity28 on the @entity8			1
we need to see every man who needs this drug receive it on the @entity8 , regardless of where they live in the @entity60			2
' human prostate cancer cells : each year around 37,000 men in the @entity60 are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year around 37,000 men in the @entity60 are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 die from the disease			1
it is the second most common cause of cancer death in men , accounting for 13 per cent			0
sir @entity70 , chief executive of @entity11 , said : ' during the consultation on the draft guidance @entity19 , the manufacturer of the drug , submitted further information for the committee to consider			0
scots have on average 16 per cent more to spend per head on @entity8 drugs than the @entity5 , which has opened up a medical care divide			1
many working patients in @entity5 are currently charged £ 7.40 per prescription even though they are free to all living in @entity28			1
prescriptions are also free in @entity6 and @entity83			1
meanwhile the @entity11 has come under frequent criticism for ruling dozens of life - prolonging drugs are not cost - effective enough			0
here are some of the recent rulings : in march 2010 @entity11 turned down the ‘ last chance ’ arthritis treatment @entity89 , which is available in @entity28 , despite it costing just £ 25 a day			2
in june 2010 @entity11 ruled that @entity91 , used to reduce the number of attacks in severely asthmatic children , was too expensive for under - 12s			0
it costs £ 12,000 a year and is available in @entity28			2
in may 2011 @entity11 turned down dasatinib , high - dose imatinib and nilotinib , which can give normal life expectancy for those with a rare blood cancer			0
the treatment costs £ 40,000 a year and is available in @entity28			2
the government has tried to improve access to cancer drugs in @entity5 and @entity6 by creating a temporary @entity106			1
so far sufferers have been prescribed nearly 10,000 treatments denied to them by the @entity8 through the £ 200m fund			0
' this included a revised patient access scheme which involves providing the drug to the @entity8 at a discounted price , further information on which patients would benefit most and clarification on how many patients could receive the drug			0
' these factors enabled the committee to revise its preliminary recommendation and now recommend the drug for use on the @entity8			0
' we are very pleased that @entity19 's submission to our consultation means that we are able to produce draft guidance recommending abiraterone - it is an effective treatment , potentially extending life by more than three months , and it also allows patients to be treated at home as it can be taken orally			0
' professor @entity134 , chief executive of the @entity135 , said : ' we are delighted by today 's decision to allow patients with advanced prostate cancer to receive abiraterone on the @entity8			1
' this drug was discovered at the @entity135 and is the result of more than two decades of dedicated work by our scientists and collaborators			0
' in clinical trials of men with advanced prostate cancer who have already tried chemotherapy , it has been shown to extend life by an average of four months and improve quality of life			1
' as @entity11 has not issued final guidance there is a chance the decision could be appealed against , and @entity8 bodies should make decisions locally on the funding of specific treatments			0
@entity11 recommended the use of abiraterone in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of castration - resistant metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed after one docetaxel - containing therapy .			1
