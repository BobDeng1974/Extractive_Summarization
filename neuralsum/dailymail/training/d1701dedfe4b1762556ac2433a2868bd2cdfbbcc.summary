by @entity0 published : 20:05 est , 16 june 2012 updated : 22:01 est , 16 june 2012 the end of slavery in the @entity3 led to anarchy and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of black @entity3 claims a new revisionist history of the @entity7			1
instead of a granting former slaves a glorious moment of freedom , president @entity11 's @entity10 condemned millions to a life of disease and hunger says historian @entity15 in his new book , ' sick from @entity17 '			1
scouring through obscure records , professor @entity15 has revealed that freed slaves were subject to outbreaks of cholera and smallpox as they attempted to start new lives for themselves and that thousands starved to death			2
@entity25 near @entity26 , @entity27 in 1860 : a new book has shed new light on the struggles of freed slaves in the @entity3 after the end of the @entity7 writing about the period of 1862 to 1870 , professor @entity15 claims that one million of the four million salves former slaves freed by @entity11 's 1863 executive order died or got sick			1
this number includes at least 60,000 who lost their lives in a smallpox epidemic that started in @entity41 and spread to the south as black @entity3 left their former slave - masters in order to find work			1
calling this ' the largest biological crisis of the 19th century ' , @entity15 states that this tragedy has failed to be acknowledged because it does not match with the rosy view of the @entity7 being a fight between the @entity49 and @entity50 for @entity52 - given rights			2
professor @entity15 new revisionist history of the @entity7 and @entity10 claims that a million black @entity3 suffered hunger and died following the end of slavery ' the freed people we want to see are the ones with all their belongings on the wagon , heading towards freedom , ' said @entity64 , a professor of history at @entity66 to the @entity67			1
' but the truth is , for every person making it there may have been one falling by the way			0
' as the anniversary of president @entity11 's order approaches , mr. @entity15 , 39 , is part of new school of thought re-addressing commonly held beliefs about the history of emancipation			1
' we 're getting ready to celebrate 150 years of the movement from slavery to freedom , ' said professor downs to the @entity67			0
' but hundreds of thousands of people did not survive that movement			0
' in fact in the years following 1863 , the public health problems that freed slaves experienced attempting to set up their own homes , getting jobs and feeding their families seemed so intense that some historical observers wondered whether all black @entity3 might die			1
in 1863 , one white religious figure wrote , ' like his brother the @entity99 of the forest , he must melt away and disappear forever from the midst of us			0
' while the accepted view is that the @entity49 was sympathetic to the plight of all southern slaves , professor @entity15 feels that there was in fact an element of turning a blind eye to the problems the newly freed people experienced			1
' in the 19th century people did not want to talk about it , ' said professor downs to the @entity114			0
' some did not care and abolitionist , when they saw so many freed people dying , feared that it proved true what some people said : that slaves were not able to exist on their own			2
' @entity122 ( far left ) , was an @entity3 abolitionist and she is photographed with a group of slaves she helped escape in the 19th century a family of former slaves outside their ramshackle house in @entity129 , @entity130 in 1865 a group of freed slaves gather on the plantation of @entity50 general @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136 , during the @entity138 occupation of the property in 1862 professor @entity15 has written ' sick from @entity17 ' which takes a fresh look at the continued racism which freed black @entity3 encountered in the @entity3 in the years following the end of the @entity7 professor @entity15 paints a desperate picture of freed families staggering away from southern plantations and finding themselves in @entity138 run ' contraband camps ' struggling for food and living in unsanitary conditions			1
his book points out the irony that these camps were sometimes no better than the freed slaves previous living conditions and that the only way out was to offer to return to the same plantations from which they had escaped			2
in ' @entity160 recounts the tragic story of one former slave , @entity162 , who arrived at a union camp in @entity164 with his wife and four children in 1864 and watched them all die within months , before he died in 1865			0
during his research , professor @entity15 discovered the horrific conditions within what were essentially refugee camps doted around the south			0
a military official with the @entity174 wrote that life for the former slaves was so appalling that they were : ' dying by scores - that sometimes 30 per day die and are carried out by wagon - loads without coffins , and thrown promiscuously , like brutes , into a trench			2
' not wishing to cast aspersions on the @entity10 , for which professor downs still holds its true moral value , he nonetheless wants to bring a fuller picture to the public			0
' i 've been alone with these people in the archives , ' said professor downs			0
' i have a responsibility to tell their stories			0

president @entity11 's @entity10 gifted freedom to four million black @entity3 in 1863
former slaves struggled to begin their free life and up to one million died or got sick
*challenges* the accepted wisdom of the @entity49 being sympathetic to the cause of freed slaves
whole families returned to work on the plantations they had escaped because there was no work and no food
