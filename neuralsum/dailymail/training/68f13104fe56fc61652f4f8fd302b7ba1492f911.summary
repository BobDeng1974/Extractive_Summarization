' as he got alongside me he moved towards me and grabbed my coat and then tried to pull my bag off my shoulders			1
' the bag was across my other shoulder so there was a bit of a struggle , but i was n’t going to let go			1
i was saying '' get off , get off , leave me alone			2
it is n’t yours ''			2
' he then started to try and unzip my bag but he did the wrong zip , it went on for about five or six minutes , he would n’t let it go , so in the end i just clobbered him			1
' i was very , very shaken , i was frightened to death and it was just instinct			2
