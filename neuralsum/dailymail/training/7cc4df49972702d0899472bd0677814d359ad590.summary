by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:51 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:51 est , 26 december 2013 @entity3 holds one of his world - record @entity6 peppers by the stem , which looks like the tail of a scorpion			1
on the other end is the bumpy , oily , fire - engine red fruit with a punch of heat nearly as potent as most pepper sprays used by police			2
it 's hot enough to leave even the most seasoned spicy food aficionado crimson - faced , flushed with sweat , trying not to lose his lunch			2
last month , the @entity23 decided @entity3 's peppers were the hottest on @entity25 , ending a more than four - year drive to prove no one grows a more scorching chili			1
the heat of @entity3 's peppers was certified by students at @entity31 who test food as part of their undergraduate classes			1
hot stuff : @entity3 displays his @entity6 peppers he claims are the hottest peppers in the world but whether @entity3 's peppers are truly the world 's hottest is a question that one scientist said can never be known			1
the heat of a pepper depends not just on the plant 's genetics , but also where it is grown , said @entity47 , director of the @entity48 at @entity49			1
and the heat of a pepper is more about being macho than seasoning			2
' you have to think of chili heat like salt			0
a little bit improves the flavor , but a lot ruins it , ' @entity47 said			0
some ask @entity3 if the record should be given to the single hottest pepper tested instead of the mean taken over a whole batch			1
after all , @entity63 is n't considered the world 's fastest man because of his average time over several races			2
but @entity3 shakes off those questions			2
' what 's the sense in calling something a record if it ca n't be replicated ? people want to be able to say they ate the world 's hottest pepper , ' @entity3 said			1
the record is for the hottest batch of @entity3 's peppers that was tested , code name @entity80 for ' @entity82 , pot no. 22 , @entity76 ' @entity3 said he has peppers from other pots and other plants that have comparable heat			1
the science of hot peppers centers around chemical compounds called capsaicinoids			1
the higher concentration the hotter the pepper , said @entity94 , the @entity31 professor whose students tested @entity3 's peppers			1
hot on the market : @entity3 sells his hot peppers at his store in @entity99 , @entity100 the heat of a pepper is measured in @entity103			1
zero is bland , and a regular jalapeno pepper registers around 5,000 on the @entity107 scale			0
@entity3 's world record batch of @entity109 comes in at 1,569,300 @entity103 , with an individual pepper measured at 2.2 million			1
pepper spray weighs in at about 2 million @entity103			0
pharmacist @entity107 devised the scale 100 years ago , taking a solution of sugar and water to dilute an extract made from the pepper			2
a scientist would then taste the solution and dilute it again and against until the heat was no longer detected			0
so the rating depended on a scientist 's tongue , a technique that @entity94 is glad is no longer necessary			0
' i have n't tried @entity3 's peppers			1
i am afraid to , ' @entity94 said			0
# i bite into a jalapeno - that 's too hot for me			2
' now , scientists separate the capsaicinoids from the rest of the peppers and use liquid chromatography to detect the exact amount of the compounds			1
a formula then converts the readings into @entity107 's old scale			0
the world record is nice , but it 's just part of @entity3 's grand plan			1
he 's been interested in peppers all his life , the hotter the better			2
ever since he got the taste of a sweet hot pepper from the @entity145 a decade ago , he has been determined to breed the hottest pepper he can			1
he is also determined to build his company , @entity147 , into something that will let the 50 - year - old entrepreneur retire before his young kids grow up			0
the peppers started as a hobby , grown in his @entity154 backyard			2
the business now spreads across a number of backyards and a couple dozen acres in @entity158			0
as his business grew , @entity3 kept his job at a bank because he promised his wife , whom he wooed a decade ago by making her a fresh batch of salsa , he would n't leave the lucrative position until they were out of debt			2
she released him from that vow in february			0
@entity3 has about a dozen employees			2
even with the publicity of the world record , he still gets nervous about making payroll			0
he said the attention has helped him move closer to the goal of making @entity176 self - sustaining			0
proceed with caution : @entity3 holds up the hot peppers that make some people spasm or vomit @entity3 's peppers are n't just about heat			1
he aims for sweetness , too			0
he makes sauces and mustards with names like ' @entity186 , ' ' @entity187 ' and ' @entity188 ' with a goal to enhance the flavor of food			0
and the hot pepper market is expanding			0
in less than five years , the amount of hot peppers eaten by @entity195 has increased 8 percent , according to @entity195 @entity197 statistics			1
@entity3 's world record has created quite a stir in the world of chiliheads , said @entity202 , a blogger from @entity203 , @entity204 , who has developed a following among hot pepper fans by videotaping himself eating the hottest peppers in the world and posting the videos on @entity210 under the name @entity212			1
@entity202 said @entity3 's world record is just the latest event in a series of pepper growers to top one another with hotter and hotter peppers			1
' that 's the biggest bragging rights there are			0
it is very , very competitive , ' he said			0
the reason people love super-hot peppers is n't much different than any other thrill seekers			0
@entity202 talks lovingly about trying the @entity6 , even though the peppers usually send him into spasms of hiccups and vomiting			0
' you only live once			0
this is safer than jumping out of an airplane , ' he said			0
@entity202 said @entity3 's news has other growers sending him peppers that seem hotter than the @entity6 on his tongue , although they will await scientific testing			1
that 's fine with @entity3			2
he knew the record would be challenged quickly and has sent off what he thinks are even hotter batches to the students at @entity31 to test			0
' nobody is going to grow hotter peppers than @entity3 , ' he said .			1

@entity3 has had the hottest pepper to ever be tested over the last 4 years granting his pepper the title of hottest in the world
scientists say that whether or not @entity3 's pepper 's are the hottest can not be known because the heat of a pepper depends not just on the plant 's genetics , but also where it is grown
the science of hot peppers centers around chemical compounds called capsaicinoids and the higher concentration the hotter the pepper
@entity3 's peppers are so hot people often will spasm and vomit
@entity3 has his own pepper company called @entity270
