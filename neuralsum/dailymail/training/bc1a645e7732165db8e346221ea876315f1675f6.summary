by @entity0 a mystery disease is killing starfish on both @entity4 coasts by causing them to explode			1
scientists are struggling to find the cause of the disease , which has been found on both the @entity9 and @entity11 coasts of @entity12			1
the unexplained wasting disease that causes white lesions to appear before the animal 's body sags and ruptures and it spills out its internal organs			1
the unexplained wasting disease that causes white lesions to appear before the animal 's body sags and ruptures and it spills out its internal organs			1
scientists prefer to call the animal a sea star rather than a starfish because these marine creatures are not fish but rather echinoderms , cousins of sand dollars , sea cucumbers and sea urchins			2
most have five arms , although some have many more			2
they are remarkably durable creatures , and when healthy are able to regenerate lost limbs			2
they are predators and use suction to pull shells apart to get at the soft body inside			1
when the shells are pried opened , the starfish pushes its stomach out of its body and into the prey , secreting enzymes that digest the victim 's soft body parts			1
researchers have ruled out some possible culprits including fungi , some parasites and certain other microorganisms and are taking a hard look at whether viruses or bacteria may be to blame			2
' the magnitude of it is very concerning , ' said @entity58 ecologist @entity57 , one of the scientists involved in the loosely organized search for a cause			2
' there 's the potential that some of these species could actually go extinct , ' @entity57 said she is concerned because the mysterious pathogen is affecting 18 different @entity69 species along their entire range			2
pathogens that affect an animal 's range in such a way like a fungus that has targeted frogs can be particularly damaging , she said			0
the disease appeared last year and is showing no indication of abating			1
' i wish we had a sign that it was petering out , but believe me it definitely is not , ' @entity57 said			0
the scientists seem to have more questions than answers			0
' what is it that has caused this ? where did it come from ? if it 's exotic , how did it get here ? is it something that 's likely to be repeated ? ' asked @entity98 , chairman of the @entity99 at the @entity100 , @entity100			0
he expressed concern that the disease that is killing the starfish could be a harbinger of bad things to come for other marine species			1
researchers have logged hundreds of examples of starfish killed by the disease ' this is a really difficult disease in lots of ways because it 's very virulent , ' @entity98 said			1
the researchers noted that starfish were the victims of previous diseases in past decades that reduced their numbers , but the current one is more serious			0
the scientists are wondering whether the starfish have been infected by a virus , bacterium or something else unwittingly imported to the region or whether a pathogen already present somehow became more dangerous , @entity98 added			0

they are significant predators in their ecosystems , the scientists said			0
' these animals are really important ecologically			0
' if they do go extinct , or at least ecologically extinct for some period of time , there undoubtedly would be some really huge impacts on the ecosystems that they live in , ' said @entity171 , a marine community ecologist at @entity172 .			0
