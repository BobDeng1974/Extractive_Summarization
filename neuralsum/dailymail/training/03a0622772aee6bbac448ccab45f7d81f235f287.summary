exclusive by @entity1 for @entity2 killed : @entity3 , 67 , was hurled from his bike - and police said it was an accident within minutes the police watchdog has slammed a force which made a string of failures over a cyclist ’s death - including saying it was an accident after just 15 minutes ' investigation			1
@entity3 , 67 , was hurled from his bicycle in a country lane almost three years ago , dying of catastrophic head injuries			1
yet paramedics did not tell police the crash had happened until a day later and , when they did investigate , they indicated there was ' no third party involvement ' after 15 minutes - before they had visited the scene or interviewed any witnesses			1
it then emerged at mr @entity3 ’s inquest that the two main witnesses argued during their 999 call about whether their car had hit him			2
mr @entity3 's widow @entity32 , 66 , who lives near @entity33 , @entity34 , has called for the investigation to be reopened ever since and fears she will never know exactly how her husband died			1
she complained to @entity38 , and the force carried out an internal probe which confirmed a number of failings in the investigation - including forensic evidence being lost when a bag containing his clothes was left open			1
but she claimed the internal probe did not go far enough , and complained to the @entity48 ( @entity48 )			2
now the @entity48 has upheld her complaint , ordering @entity38 to reinvestigate many aspects of how it dealt with mrs @entity53 's complaint			1
many decisions in the original probe into mr @entity3 's death also come under fire in the @entity48 report , which has been seen by @entity2			1
it said paramedics ’ decision not to tell police about the crash had compromised any hope the family had of knowing how mr @entity3 died			1
' the delay would undoubtedly have been detrimental ’ , it said , ‘ most significantly due to the potential loss of opportunities to seize forensic evidence at the scene			1
’ grief : mr @entity3 's widow @entity32 ( left with her son @entity73 ) has battled @entity38 for almost three years			1
now an @entity48 report has upheld her complaint against the force and told officers to look at aspects of the case again ' bungling ' : retired @entity80 engineer mr @entity3 died of catastrophic head injuries after coming off his bicycle in a country lane			1
police were initially not told about the accident at all by paramedics for more than 24 hours the report then questioned why it took four days before the force took a statement from the car driver who dialled 999			2
and it questioned why they did not seize their car itself , which has since been scrapped			0
' the vehicle had been involved with an incident which had led to a man 's death , ’ the report said , yet police gave ‘ no explanation ’ for it not being taken away			1
damage was found on the front bumper , but the owner ‘ apparently accounted for this damage as being present on the vehicle when he purchased it			0
' this explanation appears to have been accepted ... however , it is unclear on what basis [ the pc ] reached this view			0
' it appears that [ he ] discounted the possibility of a direct collision from the outset '			0
the car 's driver , the report said , ' appears to have potentially provided inaccurate information relating to the vehicle history			2
' however , it does not appear that this has been subject to any significant scrutiny by the officers investigating the collision			0
' country lane : the crash happened in this lane close to mr @entity3 's village home near @entity33 , @entity34 care : mr @entity3 cycled the same route five times a week after being bought a bicycle for his 50th birthday			1
an internal investigation also found forensic evidence was lost when a bag containing his clothes was left open @entity38 has also been ordered to reinvestigate the family 's claims that officers were ' rude ' and ' condescending ' towards them			1
and the report said there was not enough evidence that the force had learned lessons from the row , suggesting more officers could be reprimanded			2
it added : ' at this stage , it is not possible to determine whether or not any officer has a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct , as your complaints have not been sufficiently investigated			0
' three officers received ' management action ' over the row , but the family were not told what that was			0
mrs @entity53 said the @entity48 report vindicated her three - year campaign and was ‘ absolutely brilliant ’			1
she told @entity2 : ‘ all through this process we ’ve had nobody listen to us and it ’s a sense of relief that someone ’s taken our complaints seriously and agreed			0
‘ we will never stop fighting until we get justice			0
if it gets to the point where police are found to have carried out a flawed investigation then i think we should have a fresh inquest			2
a life together : mr and mrs @entity53 on their wedding day in 1967 ( left ) and before he died in november 2011 @entity183 : mr @entity3 pictured with his son @entity73 before his death in 2011			1
the family say they find it hard to grieve ‘ we ca n’t grieve			1
i ca n’t get any of it out of my head			1
we ’ve had to keep reliving it and reliving it for the last three years			2
’ retired @entity80 engineer mr @entity3 , who was married to @entity32 for 44 years , took up cycling after his children bought him a bike for his 50th birthday			2
the pensioner suffered a seven - inch fracture to his skull despite wearing a helmet when he crashed on november 24 , 2011 near his home in @entity202 , @entity34			2
he was taken to hospital where he was ruled unfit for surgery and died later the same day			0
but paramedics did not tell police and they only found out more than 24 hours after the crash - by which time the scene had long since been cleared			1
fifteen minutes after being told and before they interviewed any witnesses or visited the scene , police said no third party had been involved - a decision the force has since admitted was wrong			2
changes : ambulance chiefs in the south east have altered their policy on cyclists since mr @entity3 died the report said it was ' not possible to determine whether or not any officer has a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct , as your complaints have not been sufficiently investigated ' consequences : the @entity48 noted that one of the crash investigators was not fully - qualified at the time yet because of the way the complaints system worked , mr @entity3 's family had to wait until after an inquest recorded his death as an accident before their concerns could be addressed			1
and at the inquest they were shocked to hear the distressing 999 call , in which the car 's driver could be heard arguing with his girlfriend passenger about whether the car hit mr @entity3			2
the woman could be heard saying : ' the back end of the bike hit us ' , to which he replied : ' no it did n't , we did n't hit him at all			0
he came off and then we hit the bike , we went over the bike			0
that was what happened because he just absolutely lost it			0
' happy family : the cyclist with his wife and son @entity259 police listened to the call and decided not to re-interview the pair			0
the family had called for prosecutors to investigate the force 's conduct , but the @entity48 said that part of their complaint could not be supported as there was no evidence of a criminal offence by police			1
one small victory for the family , however , was that the @entity275 has now changed its policy because of the case to tell police immediately whenever a cyclist is hit			0
the move was hailed as a small step forward in the rights of cyclists , more than 3,000 of whom were seriously injured on @entity285 's roads last year - alongside 109 who died			0
mrs @entity53 said : ‘ i feel what we did with getting the ambulance process changed will help other cyclists , and i feel what we ’re doing now is fighting for other people who ’ve gone through the same thing			0
’ a force spokesman told @entity2 : ‘ @entity38 is very sorry that the family of @entity3 did n’t feel they received the service they deserved from @entity38			1
the issues raised by the @entity48 make disappointing reading and raise a number of concerns that we are taking very seriously			0
‘ we will be reinvestigating the family ’s complaints and further review the evidence already gathered			0
as directed by the @entity48 , this will be to establish whether the original recommendations were sufficient or whether there are any failings that have not been identified so far			0
we will of course keep the family updated at all stages of this review			0
‘ we will endeavour to do everything we can to rectify this difficult situation and our sympathy is with @entity3 ’s family following their very sad loss			0

@entity3 , 67 , hurled from his bike in country lane near @entity33 , @entity34
but medics did not tell police about crash - they only found out a day later
@entity38 then said death was accidental 15 minutes into their probe
forensic evidence was lost and investigator was not fully qualified
@entity48 report has ordered @entity38 to trawl back over widow 's complaint
she said : ' we ca n’t grieve . we *'ve* had to keep reliving it for three years '
