@entity0 , 35 , had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the ' mother of all surgeries ' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer over the course of a gruelling nine - hour operation , surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from @entity0 's cancer - ravaged body			1
one by one they worked to rid the then 32 - year - old 's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity			1
her right colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and umbilicus or belly button were removed in their entirety			1
parts of her liver and diaphragm followed			1
the drastic operation , dubbed the ' mother of all surgeries ' , left ms @entity0 with a 14 - inch scar running down the centre of her body - her ' survival trophy '			1
she repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps			1
and she was repeatedly dismissed , the finger pointed at period pains , bloating , appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome			1
but the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading ms @entity0 's body			1
a doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix , which had burst , and covered her internal organs with jelly - like cancerous cells			1
experts diagnosed the rare disease @entity56 ( @entity56 ) - the same disease which claimed the life of @entity61 icon @entity59			1
she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery			0
ms @entity0 , now 35 , and from @entity66 , said : ' the scar does n't really bother me - i see it as a survival trophy			1
' i have been very lucky , i have made a full recovery			0
' there 's nothing i ca n't do , nothing i ca n't eat or drink			0
' but obviously my fertility was compromised , but i still hope to have children someday with the eggs that were frozen just in time			0
' ms @entity0 's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular			1
in late summer of that year , she became very constipated and had a constant feeling like trapped wind on her right side , around her appendix			2
she later discovered this was the tumour on her appendix pressing against her insides			2
surgeons removed her colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and umbilicus or belly button as well as part of her liver , kidney and diaphragm she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery she went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion			1
' i kept on being fobbed off and told it was @entity111 , they did n't really know what was wrong with me , ' she said			0
' one day i took myself to @entity112 , because i thought i might have appendicitis			0
' they said it was probably just wind , and so i felt silly , as if i was a hypochondriac			0
' the cancer was finally discovered after a doctor noticed dozens of abnormal white spots covering her insides during a keyhole investigative test			2
she said : ' then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts , so i had scans which showed i did have cysts on my ovaries			1
' but it turns out that 's part and parcel of the disease			2
' then they inserted cameras into either side of my tummy to see what was in there			0
' when i came around after the procedure , i saw little white spots on the pictures , all over my bladder , uterus and bowel			0
they were everywhere in my body			0
@entity61 icon @entity59 died from the rare disease in @entity148 in january 1993 ' but after that , i did n't hear anything , so i thought it had just been the ovarian cysts , which were removed			1
' i was still feeling funny and not well , but i thought it must be nothing			0
' i went to the follow up appointment months later and the doctor said it was nothing , but about 30 minutes later i got a frantic call from him			0
' he said nurses had been chasing me down the corridor to catch me before i left			0
' he had spotted the photographs and noticed the white spots , luckily he 'd seen them			0
' for noticing them , i owe him my life really			0
it all happened very quickly after that			0
' ms @entity0 went under the knife at @entity168 , one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating @entity56			1
' they discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the ct scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere , from my diaphragm , right down to my bladder , ' she said			1
the 35 - year - old now lives a normal life			2
but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed ' they removed all the visible tumour along with the worst - affected organs including my spleen , half my large bowel , my appendix , gall bladder , ovaries and fallopian tubes , the peritoneum , a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm			1
' they scraped some bits of disease off my bladder and uterus			2
' they then pumped a heated chemotherapy solution into my abdominal cavity to kill of any remaining microscopic cancer cells			2
' the organs removed in their entirety are not essential to sustain life			2
@entity56 ( @entity56 ) is a rare cancer , affecting around one in 500,000 people a year			2
it typically begins in the appendix , presenting as a small growth , known as a polyp			2
in more rare cases it is first detected in other parts of the bowel , the ovary or bladder			2
the polyp eventually spreads through the wall of the organ from where it has orginated			0
the disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the peritoneum			1
the cancerous cells produce mucus , which collects in the abdomen as a jelly - like fluid called mucin			1
that fluid invades the abdominal cavity , causing tumours to spread			1
there are a number of possible origins of @entity56 , but the most common source is appendix cancer			2
there is no known underlying cause of @entity56			0
many patients lack clearly defined symptoms , making the disease difficult to spot until the later stages			0
the most common symptoms are : source : @entity251 and from the critical and affected organs , the liver , kidney and diaphragm , doctors only removed what was absolutely necessary			1
following the surgery , ms @entity0 underwent another radical procedure , a chemotherapy bath			1
this is where the stomach cavity is filled with hot chemotherapy liquid for around 90 minutes , while the patient remains under anaesthetic			0
bathing the inside of the stomach with the heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed			1
heat at 42 @entity272 kills cancer cells without affecting normal , healthy cells			2
the 35 - year - old has made a full - recovery and now lives a normal life			2
but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed			1
as a precaution she did have two sets of eggs frozen a few weeks before her life - changing surgery			0
determined to help others afflicted by the rare disease , ms @entity0 has now turned her focus to raising awareness of the condition			1
she warned the bloating of the abdomen that is one of the symptoms caused as the tumour spreads can be mistaken for ' middle - aged spread '			1
' the more people who know about @entity56 the more lives can be saved , the more people can be diagnosed and get treatment			0
it 's all down to a lack of awareness , ' she said			0
' if i had n't been diagnosed , it would have suffocated my organs and i would have died			0
it can be a slow growing cancer or it can kill quite quickly , it depends person to person			0
' ms @entity0 is releasing a music video which she has filmed with other @entity56 survivors and supporters of the condition			1
her creation is a 21st - century version of @entity319 's we did n't start the fire			0
the video will be released on @entity322 next week and her story can be followed on @entity324 with the hashtag # @entity325			0

@entity0 , 35 , repeatedly complained of painful stomach cramps
but doctors said they were likely period pains , bloating or irritable bowels
a scan revealed a tumour on her appendix which led to specialists revealed her true diagnosis - *pseudomyxoma* peritonei , a very rare form of cancer
it typically starts in the appendix and cancerous cells produce a mucus , jelly - like fluid that then invades the abdomen causing tumours to form
she had her colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and belly button removed in their entirety
part of her liver and diaphragm were also removed during op
ms @entity0 has since recovered and is campaigning to raise awareness
the disease is the same which killed @entity61 icon @entity59
