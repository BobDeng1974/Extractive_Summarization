since a 2007 case involving a @entity26 killer , 13 inmates have demanded the right to father children , citing the decision			2
in 2011 , one application was approved by then prisons minister @entity31			2
but today mr @entity2 , a critic of human rights rulings , told the @entity33 : ‘ i am extremely concerned about prisoners having access to artificial insemination , which is why i am reviewing the policy with a view to banning it			1
‘ there can be no clearer example of why we need changes to the human rights framework			2
’ in december , the @entity33 revealed five life prisoners , four murderers and a drug dealer , had made applications to the @entity49 for fertility treatment			2
the decision on what happens ultimately rests with the justice secretary			2
two of the five have already been refused , while the remainder are still in the system			0
any ban would inevitably end up back in the courts and test ministers ’ resolve to stand up to @entity4			0
it might also mean compensation for inmates who are refused @entity6 under the ban			1
but critics say ministers could simply refuse to pay out and let the @entity67 – the court ’s governing body – decide what action to take			0
