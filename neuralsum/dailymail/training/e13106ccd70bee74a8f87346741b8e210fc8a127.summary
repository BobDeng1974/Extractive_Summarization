by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 12:52 est , 8 january 2013 she is one of the world 's most iconic boats which for almost 40 years travelled the world 's seas			1
but following retirement in 2008 , the much - loved queen elizabeth 2 , known as the @entity7 , is now under threat of being broken up and sold for scrap			1
however , an ambitious multi-million pound scheme has now emerged to save the boat by permanently moving it to @entity14 and opening it as a plush hotel on the @entity17			1
the vessel is currently based in @entity19 and its owners are said to be in talks with @entity22 about stripping it for scrap metal			1
but it is hoped that this can be prevented by moving the ship to @entity14 and transforming it into a luxury hotel			1
ambitious : a multi-million pound scheme has now emerged to save the @entity7 by permanently moving it to @entity14 and opening it as a plush hotel on the @entity17			1
this image shows how the boat , bottom right , could look base : she would be stationed at @entity36 , opposite the @entity37 , in @entity14 she would be stationed at @entity38 - opposite the @entity37 , and near the @entity40 , @entity41 , and @entity39			1
if approved , the ambitious multi-million pound scheme would save the retired ship from the threat of being broken up and sold for scrap			1
the mayor of @entity14 's office have been informed of the plans and government ministers have been urged to back them			1
shipping expert @entity51 , who runs the website @entity53 , said a reception building and walkway would be built on the riverside			2
position : the boat would be located on the opposite side of this bank arrival : the queen elizabeth 2 is escorted by the @entity64 coast guard as she arrives in @entity19 , @entity64 following her retirement in 2008 and the five star development could even house a decommissioned @entity68 aeroplane			1
he said : ' recent correspondence with the mayor of @entity14 's office and other related @entity74 sources illuminated a fully realised vision for @entity7 's next era on the @entity17			1
' @entity77 would see the whole area of @entity36 demolished , replacing it with parking , a reception building and a walkway to the ship			2
' @entity84 would include the construction of additional commercial visitor attraction buildings , and possibly incorporate the supersonic @entity68 plane			2
' of the original passenger accommodation , it is intended to use the 330 first class cabins and 250 of the larger tourist cabins for the hotel			2
' the @entity7 spent 39 years carrying passengers around the world in luxury after she was launched by cruise firm @entity97 in 1969			2
the @entity7 was launched at the yard of @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 , pictured , in 1967 she left her home port of @entity104 for the last time in november 2008 , sailing to @entity105 was due to open as an international tourist attraction but development stalled as the global recession took hold and she has not moved since			2
the ship 's @entity19 owners are now said to be in talks with @entity22 about stripping it for scrap metal			0
former owner @entity97 has cast doubt on the reports - but fans of the legendary liner fear for her future			0
almost 1,000 people have already signed an official e-petition urging the government to support the ' @entity124 ' project			1
it would be an expensive operation because the @entity7 is unlikely to be able to make the voyage from @entity19 under her own power after a long lay - up			0
@entity7 would be loaded with enough ballast to sit on the tidal river bed and open as a five - star hotel with tours for the public			0
the @entity7 was initially designed as a transatlantic service between her home port of @entity104 and @entity138			0
operated by @entity97 , she began an almost 40 year career in 1969 and served as the flagship of the line until succeeded by rms queen mary 2 in 2004			0
during her years of service , the @entity7 undertook regular world cruises and was known as being the height of glamour			0
historic : queen elizabeth ii questions one of the experts as she tours the kitchens during a visit to the @entity7 at @entity104 on the eve of the liner 's maiden trans - @entity158 voyage to @entity138 in 1969 originally featuring three classes of service , the ship appealed to stars such as @entity163 and @entity164 and also captured the imagination of those less affluent , who were blocked by stairways and elevators from entering first - class spaces even for a peek			0
passengers dressed for dinner in formal gowns and tuxedos and top - name show - biz stars entertained			0
in may 1982 she even took part in the @entity177 , carrying 3000 troops and 650 volunteer crews			0
this involved her being refitted with three helicopter pads , dormitories and fuel pipes to allow for refuelling at sea			0
incredibly , more than 650 @entity97 crew members volunteered for the voyage to transport the members of the @entity188			0
the vessel returned to the @entity74 in june 1982 and was greeted in @entity104 by queen elizabeth , the queen mother .			0

she would be stationed opposite the @entity37 in @entity14
government ministers have been urged to back the plans
