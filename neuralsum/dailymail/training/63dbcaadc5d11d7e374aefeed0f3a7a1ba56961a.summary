@entity1 's farcical attempt to depose @entity3 president @entity2 has hit a new low with the revelation he faces charges for breaching the governing body ’s ethics codes for his links to gambling			1
that would happen if he becomes an official candidate as of thursday ’s deadline			0
he would also be left without funding at that stage because his publicity - hungry bookmaker backers @entity16 , who announced when they ‘ launched ’ @entity1 that he needed £ 2.3m to run , now say they ‘ will not be contributing financially beyond january 27 ’			1
any potential challenger to @entity2 to become the most powerful person in the global game after may ’s election has until thursday officially to declare their candidacy , backed by support from five national associations			2
@entity1 's links to gambling could derail his bid to depose @entity3 president @entity2 @entity3 's rules state that all presidential candidates are forbidden from being associated with gambling but @entity3 ’s rules governing the presidential race explicitly state that all candidates are bound by the organisation ’s code of ethics , which forbids ‘ being associated with betting , gambling , lotteries and similar events ’			1
given that @entity1 ’s campaign is being run by @entity16 , who are paying him £ 250,000 over five months to run , he would be in clear breach of @entity44 of @entity3 ’s ethics code as a candidate			1
to make matters worse , the @entity48 firm are collecting donations from football fans that the campaign website says are non-refundable , for a campaign built around @entity1 and run via a new company called @entity56 , a subsidiary vehicle of @entity16 set up for the purpose			1
@entity3 ’s ethics code also forbids active or passive stakes ‘ in companies , concerns , organisations ... that promote [ betting ] ’			2
it remains unlikely @entity1 will get the backing of five fas and even be able to continue his stunt beyond thursday			2
he also faces problems in showing he has held an ‘ active ’ role in football for two years in the past five years as laid out in condition @entity71 of the presidential race rules			0
this specifies candidates should have worked as ‘ a board member , committee member , referee , assistant referee , coach , trainer [ or ] any other person responsible for technical , medical or administrative matters in @entity3 , a @entity83 ’			2
@entity1 has claimed that work for @entity88 ’s ill - fated 2018 @entity87 bid and consultancy work for obscure third - tier @entity90 club @entity89 help him meet the criteria			1
but his ‘ active ’ work for the @entity66 covered a few weeks of trips and pr days			0
and the president of the @entity90 club , @entity97 , has admitted @entity1 has held no formal role , has not been paid for work there and has acted as an advisor ‘ mainly over the phone ’			1
@entity1 has launched a campaign to replace @entity2 as @entity3 president @entity1 's campaign was announced at a press conference in @entity107 on january 16th @entity97 told the @entity108 that @entity1 never goes to the club as he does not want to interfere with the coaches ’ work there			1
a spokesman for @entity16 said : ‘ we are happy to engage with @entity3 as part of the electoral process and furnish them with any documentation they request in this regard			1
’ if @entity1 did somehow garner the support of five @entity122 , a @entity3 election committee would then scrutinise whether he is even eligible to stand — and whether he should face a @entity3 ethics charged for his association to gambling			1
hundreds of members of the public have donated to his campaign , albeit only a few thousand pounds collectively , and in a contradiction to the the policy on the campaign website , @entity16 now say : ‘ in case @entity1 does n’t make it through , we will look to fully reimburse fans who have donated to the campaign			1
’ @entity2 will be heavy odds - on favourite to keep the presidency and may face just one rival candidate , with @entity139 of @entity140 his likeliest contender			2
two former long - term @entity3 insiders , @entity143 of @entity90 and @entity144 of @entity145 , will announce in the coming days whether they have the five fas they need to support their own bids			1
@entity143 is expected to announce soon whether he will stand for @entity3 presidency prince @entity139 ( left ) could be the only challenger that @entity2 could face ( right ) @entity144 was the head of the inspection team that assessed bid nations ’ suitability for the past few @entity87 hosting races			1
in an exclusive interview last week in @entity155 as he attended a ‘ new @entity158 ’ summit to discuss reform , he told @entity159 that football was betrayed by the decision to award the @entity162 to @entity163			0
his own evaluation report warned of the dangers of the heat in the june - july 2022 period nations were bidding for			0
‘ the weather in @entity163 makes it impossible to play in june - july , as it was in the [ bidding ] contract			0
it ’s impossible , ’ he said , adding @entity163 should not even have been on the ballot paper for the 22 executive committee members to chose from			0
‘ i made it very clear that [ there was a potential problem with ] the health of the players if we play in @entity163 , ’ he said			0
they [ @entity182 ] either took the decision before they read the inspection report , or they read it but did n’t understand			0
’ after @entity144 first floated the idea he might challenge @entity2 , he himself was hit with an ethics investigation that most observers believe is a trumped - up way to discredit him			2
@entity191 ( right ) of @entity145 could potentially stand against @entity2 asked if he thought it was a conspiracy to derail him standing against @entity2 , he said : ‘ i do n’t have the energy to think about that			2
otherwise i will lose control of my mind			0
’ he added that for the public ’s confidence in @entity3 to be renewed , it is imperative @entity2 must go			1
‘ that ’s very clear , ’ he says			0
‘ his period is over			0
i think he must realise you need new people to get back the confidence of the public			0
you can not say i ’ve been doing things one way for 41 years [ inside @entity3 ] and now for the next four i ’m going to do it this way			0

@entity1 started a campaign to replace @entity2 as @entity3 president
the @entity90 was backed by bookmakers @entity16
but @entity3 rules state candidates can not be associated with gambling
