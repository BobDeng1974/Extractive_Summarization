however , discounts are only for those who have a large number of friends and followers on @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			2

a night at the @entity49 in @entity50 , which is usually priced at $ 429 a night ( £ 268 ) , for example , is currently available for a discounted rate of $ 258 ( £ 161 ) per night			0

@entity75 , a co-founder of the site , told fastcompany.com : ' @entity8 works similar to an online dating site that , as opposed to it being a one - sided marketplace , both parties basically create a profile that describes who they are			1
' both parties get to say what they 're looking for on the other side and our system makes the ideal match			0
' the website 's principle works on the same lines as a traditional travel agents			0
the main difference however is how the information is gathered			0
members are asked to link in their social media sites – as well as any other hotel or airline reward benefits they have accrued – to @entity8 before they are given access to discounts ' it pays to be you ' : those with an active online presence will be offered customised concessions which are tailored to their social media profile once a member links in their social media sites – as well as any other hotel or airline reward benefits they have accrued – to @entity8 , the site has unprecedented access to a vast bank of information			1
this can range from how many travel photos a member posts on @entity24 or @entity27 , to how often they tweet about their experiences on @entity23			0
@entity26 is also a valuable tool in the collection of information ; someone with a higher - paying job and more connections will be more inclined to book stays in the luxury properties on the site			1
and possibly be more inclined to ' talk ' about the experience on their online networks			2
once the website is aware of a member 's habits , likes and dislikes , the information is aggregated and then presented ( anonymously ) to member hotels in the @entity141 , who are then able to offer the traveller tailored discounts			0
' hotels do n't just want customers who spend a lot today , they want someone who 's likely to spend a lot in the future , ' mr @entity75 told @entity151			0
' plus , they want someone who will influence their friends to stay there too			2
