by @entity1 reporter published : 11:18 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 14 august 2013 the beauty queen arrested earlier this month for throwing homemade bombs from a moving car in a @entity6 suburb , stepped down from her position as miss @entity8 tuesday in light of recent legal charges			1
the announcement was confirmed on the @entity13 of @entity8 's website			1
speaking with @entity16 and the @entity17 , 18 - year - old @entity15 explained why she was giving up her title			1
' i just thought that it would be best for the city of @entity8 and all the people affected by our decision and my choice to just step down and resign from my position and let someone else take it from here , ' @entity15 said			1
felony bomb possession is punishable by 1 to 15 years in prison			1
the 18 - year - olds were arrested august 3 after driving around neighborhoods and allegedly tossing 8 oz plastic bottles filled with caustic chemicals at people they knew			1
all four teens acknowledged they were tossing bombs powered by a toilet bowl cleaner reacting with aluminum foil on sidewalks , front yards or in streets ' to scare some of their other friends , ' @entity60 investigator @entity59 said in a court affidavit			1
' we do n't really understand a clear reason for their behavior , ' prosecutor @entity71 said			0
' the reason we charged them is obviously , what they possessed was indeed explosives , and we 're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people , and therefore , had the potential to cause a great deal of harm			1
' for more videos , please go to @entity16 @entity15 is charged with manufacturing home - made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes @entity15 called the act a ' stupid mistake ' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone			1
' we did n’t think about what we were doing at the time , ' she said			0
' we did n’t know that it would get to this point			0
we meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all			2
' no one was injured in the incident , but that did n't get the teens off the hook			2
' they were throwing them at both property and people , ' unified fire authority capt. @entity113 told @entity118			2
' this goes well beyond a teenage prank			2
' ' they 're very caustic , very nasty			0
so they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody , much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused , ' @entity113 told the television station			0
' they can very easily cause serious harm or even death			2
' @entity15 had just been crowned miss @entity8 and was supposed to go on to compete for the @entity135 title before her arrest on her side : @entity15 's attorney , left , thinks the charges are overkill			1
her parents @entity141 , second from right , and @entity142 , right , defended their daughter 's actions @entity15 's attorney @entity145 thinks the charges are overkill and that her title of miss @entity8 is almost being held against her			1
' you could say it 's possible that the chemical could splash someone , but that certainly was not their intetion , ' @entity145 said			0
' they were n't trying to harm anyone			2
they were playing a prank			2
' @entity15 was crowned miss @entity8 , topping a slate of nine beauty contestants earlier this summer in the @entity162 suburb			1
she showed off years of piano training with a @entity165 number and took home a $ 2,000 scholarship			0
it took a lot of hard work to win that title and scholarship , so giving it up was pretty difficult for @entity15			1
' i just ( knew ) … i would probably have to get it taken away from me , just because of the contract			0
so i ’d rather have it be my decision now than to have someone take it from me , ' she said			0
one of @entity15 's friends claims they were throwing the bombs as a prank , however , authorities said someone could have been gravely injured by the explosives her parents also weighed in on the rebellious act			1
her mother , @entity189 , said it was hard to get mad at her daughter knowing that her intentions were good			0
her father @entity193 described the past week the hardest of his life , but he 's confident that the situation will sort itself out			0
' i ’m confident that the legal system will handle it correctly , and the people that understand the facts of what ’s going on and the character of all four of the youngsters that are involved in this will see this and handle it appropriately , ' he said			0
gill herself remains optimistic that the situation will be positive in the end			0
' i do believe this whole thing is a way to help us grow and to learn from our mistakes and to move forward and just kind of get on with our lives			0
