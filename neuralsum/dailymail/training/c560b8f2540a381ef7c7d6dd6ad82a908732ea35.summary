' almost an hour follows of battle scenes where militants wield rocket launchers , the footage manipulated with special effects			0

in the final minutes of the tape , a masked jihadist in desert fatigues , speaks directly to camera in a different @entity5 accent to the man who provided the voice - over			1
an @entity1 flag billows as @entity26 soldiers , loyal to dictator @entity27 , dig their own shallow shallow graves in the sand			1
in a deep voice , the @entity1 militant , who appears tall and well - built , speaks first in @entity79 before transitioning into fluent , well - spoken @entity18 to deliver a chilling message			2
he said : ' we 're here in the 17th division military base just outside the city of @entity31			0
in the chilling tape released on friday , @entity1 line up the @entity26 soldiers captured during an attack on an airbase in @entity31 in the sickening footage , the soldiers are shot in the back of the head by the @entity1 militants , their bodies rolling into a shallow grave ' we 're here with the soldiers of @entity27 , you can see them now digging their own graves where they were stationed			1

@entity143 rep. @entity142 made the remarks during a speech to @entity146 on september 12			0
' one of the concerns is the number of @entity5 citizens who have left our country to go join up with @entity1 , ' he said			2
' it is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that			0
' ' it is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with @entity1 have now returned to our country			0
those 40 are under @entity141 attention and surveillance			0
so they are known and they are being tracked by the @entity141			0
' @entity5 jihadis , part of a swelling ' foreign fighter ' contingent aiding the self - designated @entity1 ( @entity1 ) could put their ideologies and experience to work in the @entity5 , a fact that has some in @entity173 clamoring for easier ways to revoke their citizenship			1
the @entity176 said two weeks ago that only about a dozen @entity5 had left the country to join up with @entity1 , while as many as 100 are suspected of taking up arms with a wider range of @entity181 extremist groups in the @entity182 and @entity183			1

the @entity187 had yet to comment on friday when contacted by @entity185 about the authenticity of the tape and the suspected involvement of an @entity5			0
just days ago , @entity1 had released a similarly slickly - produced ' @entity7 ' trailer warning the @entity5 of the carnage it wants to inflict in @entity194 if president @entity56 deploys troops to the war - torn nation as he attempts to ' degrade and ultimately destroy ' the terror group			1
timing of the trailer and the feature - length film , suggested @entity1 were directly responding to general @entity201 , the chairman of the @entity202 , who told the @entity203 this week that fighting in @entity194 may require the use of ground troops			2
the trailer was also released by the @entity207 , which has become known for its propaganda videos for @entity1 which include high - production values , cgi explosions and slow motion footage			2
the movie is just the latest heavily - edited video from @entity1 that has included gruesome footage of the beheadings of two @entity5 journalists and a @entity218 aid worker			1
in the latest hostage video released on thursday , @entity218 photojournalist @entity219 sits behind a desk and in a measured tone makes the case for @entity225 powers to negotiate with his captors			0
