campaigners have warned that shoppers are being hoodwinked by organic beauty products laced with chemicals found in antifreeze , floor cleaners and engine oil shoppers are being hoodwinked by organic beauty products laced with chemicals found in antifreeze , floor cleaners and engine oil , campaigners warned last night			1
it said boots , @entity12 and other manufacturers misled the public			2
the @entity15 surveyed shampoos , creams and other toiletries labelled as being organic , natural or inspired by nature			1
@entity12 was criticised for using an unofficial logo to proclaim its pure and natural hand cream as ’ 95 per cent natural ’			1
however , the ingredients show it contains methylisothiazolinone , a preservative found in window and floor cleaners and air fresheners			1
the association said the chemical could cause cancer and is suspected of causing nerve damage			0
boots botanics – a skin care range which draws on the ‘ power of plants ’ – was also put under the microscope			1
items singled out included the facial oil , costing £ 9.99 , which is labelled as 100 per cent organic but was found to contain at least four non-organic ingredients			2
@entity43 firm @entity42 – a beauty company unconnected to the @entity45 baby food manufacturer of the same name – was accused of ‘ misleading marketing ’			0
although the brand name suggests products will be organic , its coconut shampoo does not contain any organic ingredients , and there were concerns that at least one component may cause cancer			2
unlike organic food , the labelling of organic beauty products is not covered by law			0
however , there are voluntary certification schemes run by organisations , including the @entity15			2
to qualify , certain chemicals are banned from products and all plant - based ingredients must have been grown organically			0
@entity67 , the @entity15 ’s policy director , said the many companies that strive to meet the standards are being undermined by those that take shortcuts and make misleading claims			0
he added : ‘ it is wrong that people are putting chemicals found in antifreeze , paint , oven cleaner and floor cleaner on their skin , when they thought they were buying a product made from only natural or organic ingredients			1
’ the @entity15 surveyed shampoos , creams and other toiletries labelled as being organic , natural or inspired by nature @entity12 and @entity42 did not comment on the claims			1
boots said any problems with its @entity95 range were related to labelling and not the products themselves			0
a spokesman added : ‘ the botanics range uses the power of plants extracts with scientific formulations to create effective skin care products			1
we would like to reassure our customers that the ingredients in the @entity107 support a 100 per cent organic claim and trading standards approve our process			0
‘ the ingredient list on the packaging may not make this clear			0
we will look to rectify this immediately			0
