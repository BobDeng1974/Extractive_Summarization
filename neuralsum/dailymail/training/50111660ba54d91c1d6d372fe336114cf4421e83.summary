@entity0 has demanded @entity1 be afforded time to shape @entity3 , just like sir @entity4 got early in his reign , and predicts the @entity6 will eventually bring the title back to @entity8			1
the @entity10 star is planning to watch @entity3 ’s clash against @entity12 on sunday on television in @entity14 and believes fit - again @entity15 could prove the decisive factor			1
@entity3 trail leaders @entity12 by 10 points having only won three times in eight games and @entity0 thinks the gap is too large to bridge , signaling @entity24 ’s side as would - be champions			1
‘ sometimes the coaches need time to change the team to what they want , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ in the @entity31 all the teams are fighting a lot for points and even the clubs at the bottom of the table can beat those at the top			0
‘ i read something recently from sir @entity4 saying @entity29 will need time and he is right			1
in the beginning even sir @entity4 did n’t win anything for a few years and it was a complicated time for him while he got the team together that he wanted			1
‘ to get a good squad and a good team takes time so lets give @entity29 the time he needs			1
he is a fantastic coach and very experienced and i am certain he will make @entity3 champions again , if not this year then very spoon after that			2
’ @entity15 has performed best of all the players bought in @entity29 ’s £ 156million summer spree – scoring or assisting seven goals in his six @entity31 games			2
@entity0 is still in touch with his former @entity10 team - mate and says the @entity64 will raise his game against @entity24 ’s men			1
ronaldo : ‘ i read something recently from sir @entity4 saying @entity29 will need time and he is right ' ‘ to change @entity14 for @entity70 is always going to be a big difference because the weather is not the same in @entity73 as it is in @entity10			1
it 's colder , often raining and always cloudy , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ of course it is going to be a big , big challenge for him but i am 100 % sure he will be a massive success at @entity3			2
he will enjoy it i know			0
click here for the match report from @entity10 's 3 - 1 win over @entity82 ‘ it ’s great that he might be fit to play @entity12 because @entity15 was always an important player for @entity10 in the big games – he always rises to the occasion			1
’ @entity0 believes this season is too soon for @entity3 to reclaim the title , but is rooting for his old club to finish in the top four			2
they are n't in a good moment because they have dropped many points but they have a good coach and we need to give him time and see what happens			0
‘ it would be amazing and good news for me if they did make the @entity32 because i would love to play against them again			0
@entity0 believes this season is too soon for @entity3 to reclaim the title , but thinks they can finish in the top four @entity0 says ' you can never write off @entity3 ' but that @entity12 are already too far ahead this year ‘ you can never write off @entity3			1
it is only the beginning but it will be tough for @entity3 to win the title this year i think because they are already too many points behind @entity12 in my opinion			2
‘ @entity12 are a little bit stronger than all the other teams this year			0
but of course in the @entity31 over a season you never know what can happen			0
that period near @entity120 is really tough and you can easily drop points because there are a lot of games in a really short space of time			0
‘ @entity12 have made a great start and they can be champions			0
i hope @entity3 can come again at the top of the league			0
‘ at the moment they are many points behind @entity12 and have had some disappointing results at the start of the season			0
but let 's see what happens it is an exciting league and anything can happen			0
