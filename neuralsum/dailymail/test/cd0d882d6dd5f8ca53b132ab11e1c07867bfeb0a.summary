@entity0 , 63 , from @entity1 , @entity2 , was made so sick by obesity - related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated it is a toe - curling moment that many have faced : the supermarket tantrum			1
and @entity0 , pouting and shouting , performs it with aplomb			1
' i do n't want to ! ' is the cry when he is asked if he will try whelks			0
despite the wobbly bottom lip and huffy , crossed arms , @entity0 happens to be a 63 - year - old father of four grown - up children			1
and in this bizarre episode of role - reversal , it is his sons , @entity25 and @entity26 , who are gently – some might say valiantly – trying to broaden his palate			1
the problem will be all too familiar to anyone who has broached the subject of healthier eating with a parent who might not have the most up - to - date ideas about diet			2
but the @entity37 boys are motivated by a matter of life and death			0
for years , @entity0 was ill , made so sick by obesity - related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated			1
turning round his health would mean changing the habits of a lifetime of poor food choices and no exercise			0
and @entity0 resisted with a passion			1
while many would have admitted defeat in the face of his almost insurmountable stubbornness , the two brothers overhauled their father 's health , and crucially , his attitude			2
and in doing so , they have undoubtedly saved his life			0
@entity25 and @entity26 have helped their father shed six stone and now , two years after that tantrum in the supermarket , @entity0 is a man transformed			1
he loves to cycle , never eats take - aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods			1
most remarkably , doctors say he is no longer diabetic – and he is off medication			1
the supermarket stand - off was caught on camera for a forthcoming film called @entity74 , a searingly honest but moving account of the @entity77 ' journey , which has already won coveted slots at film festivals			2
the brothers have a lifelong passion for film – @entity26 , 35 , is a full - time film - maker – so they decided to document their battle to inspire others to do the same			1
@entity25 , 37 , says : ' he was n't old , but @entity74 had given up on himself			1
he blamed himself for his illness but did n't think he could do anything about it			0
getting a grown man to change his ways is difficult and there were times when it felt like it was pointless , but we knew we had to carry on			0
just the thought of losing him spurred us on			2
' luckily for @entity0 , his sons are just as stubborn as he used to be , and their plan has been a huge success			1
' the difference in @entity74 is incredible and he is proof that it 's never too late , ' says @entity25 , a father - of - four from @entity1 , @entity2			1
' physically , he 's gone from having to use crutches to get around to taking on 100 - mile cycle challenges			1
mentally he 's a new person – he had retreated into himself and was probably depressed			2
before his sons intervened , his exercise routine was non-existent and he tipped the scales at 20 stone			1
he existed on a high - fat , high - sugar diet			2
sometimes he 'd eat three takeaway meals a day			0
@entity25 , a corporate financial adviser , says : ' he had an old - fashioned mentality that cooking was a woman 's domain , so he 'd opt for something convenient and quick			1
@entity113 would cook him healthy dinners but @entity74 would sneak in a takeaway on the way home			2
' @entity0 's weight problems were worrying enough , but there was the added complication of his type 2 diabetes , which affects more than 2.7 million @entity135			1
if left untreated , the condition can leave a person up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke , and at risk of foot problems due to nerve damage and poor circulation			0
rates of type 2 diabetes are soaring due to increasing obesity , unhealthy diets , a lack of exercise and an ageing population			2
@entity0 was first diagnosed with diabetes in 2003			1
but it was n't until a visit to a podiatrist in august 2013 that the gravity of his situation was laid bare			0
' @entity74 had an ulcer that was giving him a lot of discomfort , ' @entity25 says			1
' he was having to use crutches and going to have the ulcer cleaned and dressed on a regular basis			0
' things had got so bad that the podiatrist told @entity74 there was a risk he might lose his leg if he carried on as he was			0
until then , in his mind having diabetes was just popping a few more pills in addition to ones he was already on for his high blood pressure and cholesterol			0
this was the wake - up call we all needed			0
' he now loves to cycle , never eats take - aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods @entity25 and @entity26 knew drastic action was needed			1
' @entity74 obviously had weight issues which we 'd talked about in the past , but we had busy lives so did n't really push it as far as we could have done , ' says @entity25			1
step one was to overhaul @entity0 's diet			2
out went the convenience foods and in came a strict two - month , 800 calorie - a - day diet under the watchful eye of professor @entity194 at @entity195			0
he is conducting a study , funded by charity @entity197 , which aims to see if a low - calorie diet can permanently reverse type 2 diabetes			2
step two was to encourage @entity0 to be more active , to improve his fitness and outlook on life			2
' we wanted him to find a social life and hobby other than work and food – we 've done everything from fishing to t'ai chi , ' @entity25 says			1
' but we knew he had to take up an achievable form of exercise that did n't put pressure on his foot , so cycling became a big part of his regime			0
' he adds : ' of course there were rows , especially when he was on the low - calorie diet			0
he 'd enjoyed food in the past , but it was the wrong food and here we were telling him it was no good for him , and he had to cook dishes from scratch			0
' it 's a fine balance taking on an almost parental role with your own dad			0
we had to be encouraging , but firm , without him feeling he was being bullied into anything			0
' that 's where the filming proved so useful			0
@entity25 explains : ' filming the whole process meant we could show him footage from a couple of weeks before as a motivator so he could see how far he 'd come			2
' in february last year , the sons took their father on a ten - day cycling trip to @entity241			1
@entity0 also tried out a sky - dive simulator ( he 's planning to do one for real later this year ) , and tackled rock - climbing			1
' he 'd spent almost four decades doing soul - destroying night shifts , eating large amounts of processed food and doing no exercise			0
' we wanted to inspire him , to show him how great life could be , ' @entity25 says			2
' while the weight loss is fantastic , what is really amazing is his new self - confidence , his self - belief and his love of life			0
' step three was transforming @entity0 into a diabetes champion , so he could convince others to turn their lives around			1
now a trimmer 14 stone , @entity0 has taken part in the @entity262 100 - mile cycle race , spoken at medical conferences throughout @entity264 and stopped his diabetes in its tracks			1
at the most recent meeting with his consultant , he was told he is diabetes - free			2
@entity0 believes the doctors had been ' too nice for too long ' , and wishes they had been tougher on him			1
' i 'm just so cross i lived for so long with such a bad quality of life , depressed and basically killing myself			0
hopefully my transformation can inspire others too			0
' fixing @entity0 's diabetes has brought the family closer , says @entity25			1
' we went to @entity279 over @entity280 and @entity74 was out walking with the grandchildren , which would have been almost impossible two years ago			0
the kids love having a grandad who is active , and we 've got our old dad back			0
