krokodil victim ? @entity1 died in november last year and now authorities in @entity4 suspect that he may have perished as a result of his use of krokodil worried authorities are working to determine if the flesh eating drug krokodil has claimed its first victims in @entity12 , after the gruesome death of an @entity4 father - of - four and his friend			1
the @entity16 suspects that @entity1 , 33 , died as a result of complications from his use of the potent new drug that eats the body from inside out			1
both @entity23 and his unidentified friend had such horrific skin damage that they were treated in the hospital burns unit their deaths said dr. @entity30 , director of the @entity31			1
if it is confirmed that @entity33 perished using the terrifying new drug , which is responsible for thousands of deaths in @entity36 and is made from codeine and gasoline , it will represent a serious escalation for the spread of krokodil which is being dubbed the ' poor man 's meth '			1
' we were reluctant to publish it , ' dr. @entity30 tells the @entity47			2
' but now that it ’s out there , we really want the message to be , ‘ this is an end game move			2
this is going to kill you			2
’ @entity23 was admitted to hospital in @entity55 in november and died of a heart attack , but his autopsy results revealed evidence of krokodil use - including the tell - tale symtom of missing and rotting scaly , reptilian - like skin - hence its name			1
' his skin was missing , ' said @entity23 's friend @entity66 to @entity67			1
watched a friend die : @entity66 said the drug killed her best friend , @entity1 ' the doctors say it ate him from the inside out			1
it was n't until the next day that they told us that is was krokodil meth			1
' everything that touched him took his skin off			2
' initially , @entity23 's condition was a mystery to doctors who airlifted him from his hometown of @entity85 to a larger hospital in @entity55			1
' they said , ‘ chunks of his skin are falling off and they ca n’t get an iv in , ' said his sister - in - law @entity23 to @entity47			1
@entity92 , which is similar to heroin and originated in @entity36 10 years ago , turns users into zombies and the homemade concoction can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline or oil			2
the drug is made of readily available ingredients such as codeine , iodine and toxins such as gasoline , industrial cleaning oil , lighter fluid and paint thinner			2
users filter and boil ingredients together , then inject the drug			0
spreading : there have now been at least eight cases of the skin - rotting @entity36 drug krokodil reported in the @entity12 , according to medical professionals and at least two resulted in death the autopsy on @entity23 showed he was positive for desomorphine , the active ingredient in codeine , but doctors also found morphine , methamphetamine , and amphetamine			1
however , at his funeral , @entity23 's friends , one who has since also died because of suspected krokodile use , told @entity129 that they were indeed using krokodil after finding the recipe online			1
' it ’s manufactured very similar to methamphetamine and that 's where some people may call it krokodil meth , but what it is , it ’s an opiate similar to heroin , ' said @entity142 of the @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
the @entity16 has been looking into the drug since @entity145 ’s death last november			1
' it ’s possible right now that we have two deaths , and those could be just two that we are aware of , ' @entity142 said			1
officials with the @entity16 confirmed both of those victims were men from @entity85 , @entity4			1
@entity66 said the two men were friends			0
she said @entity145 was a father of four young children			2
' their dad is gone because someone chose to make an evil drug , ' @entity66 said			0
' i was there when he took his last breath			0
no family member should ever go through what we saw him go through			0
' this @entity36 man is suffering the side - effects of krokodil use			2
doctors say there are users of the drug in @entity174 just weeks after first known cases in @entity12 were reported in @entity176 gaping wounds : this heavily blurred image shows the effects of krokodil on users leaving skin rotting hanging off their body continual use of @entity92 , @entity36 for crocodile , causes blood vessels to burst , leaving skin green and scaly and eventually causing gangrene			1
in @entity36 around 30,000 people die from the affects of the drug every year			0
it is thought abouta quarter of a million people in the country are now hooked on the poison			0
despite this , dr. @entity30 told @entity47 he believes the drug to be ' self - limiting ' - addicts will likely die within two years , not spread the drug and warned against any scare - mongering of an epidemic			0
' this is a poor man 's drug , ' said dr. @entity30			0
' it is kind of the end of the road			0
they run out of money , they ’re horribly addicted			0
they cook it , inject it , get high , wake up and want more			0
' while the @entity217 is not confirming any cases of deaths of usage of the drug , they have admitted they are aware of investigations in @entity4 , @entity176 , @entity223 and @entity224			1
and in another sign the drug is spreading across the nation , following reports of krokodil abuse in both @entity176 and @entity174 , @entity224 , the drug is now believed to have hit @entity231			1
a source has claimed that the drug is being sold in at least two nightclubs in @entity231 ’s hip @entity235			0
@entity92 fears : unconfirmed reports suggest that the drug has spread to @entity231 after previously being reported in @entity224 and @entity176 the @entity47 reports that @entity239 , who witnessed the effects of krokodil while serving in the @entity242 in @entity243 , saw a man being throw out of @entity245 for selling the drug , and was approached by a deal at @entity248 , who reportedly tried to sell him krokodil and clean syringes in the bathroom			1
the announcement comes after a worrying wave of some victims injecting themselves with krokodil because they think it is heroin , doctors said			2
the first instances of its use in the @entity12 were recorded in @entity176 last month			0
it is already widely used in @entity36			0
three cases have now been reported in @entity174 and doctors say two of the women did not even know they had been sold the drug			2
the victims were all aged between 18 and 25 and come from middle - class backgrounds			0
pictures and videos of users in @entity36 show blackened fingertips , large open wounds , and even exposed bone where skin has fallen off			0
prolonged or even short - term use can damage blood vessels , muscle , cartilage , and bone , and amputation is frequently the only way to save a patient ’s life			0
doctors have warned of the horrifying side effects of the homemade drug , which is said to give a more powerful high than heroin			0
the flesh rotting that is specific to the drug occurs directly at the injection site , often leaving users with wounds to their feet or arms .			0
