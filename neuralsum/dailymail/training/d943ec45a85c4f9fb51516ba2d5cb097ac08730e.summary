by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 13:04 est , 3 december 2012 it is one of the world 's fastest supercars , with a 252mph top speed that leaves rivals trailing in its wake			0
and now @entity9 car manufacturer @entity8 has revealed the science behind the @entity12 's astonishing top speed by covering the car in the sums used to power it			1
conceptual artist @entity16 was asked by @entity8 to create his own design for the £ 1.5million @entity19 model			1
the 252mph @entity12 has been decorated with the equations that power its superfast engine the one - off supercar , which @entity8 has refused to put a price on , is best appreciated while parked up so the @entity26 , 71 , covered the convertible in the complex equations used by engineers in the @entity12 ’s construction			1
the result is a car which brings a new meaning to the phrase ‘ @entity35 ’ - with the supercar looking more at home in a science lab or art gallery than on the road			0
but while it looks good sat still , the car ’s forte remains its staggering performance - accelerating from 0 - 62mph in just 2.7 seconds			0
and @entity8 was clearly pleased with the result , with a spokesman gushing that the car was object that ' integrates the symbol of speed with a fascinating , painterly exterior and an interior that alludes to haute couture '			1
the car ’s interior also features the mathematical formulae which have been painstakingly stitched in orange onto the inside of the doors			2
the retro brown and orange interior of the car has been painstakingly hand - stitched @entity9 's famous craftmanship is in evidence in the @entity8 's luxurious interior artist @entity16 said of the car : ' i realised how i could translate my passion for mathematical equations and scientific treatises into three - dimensional form			1
' @entity16 , who is based in @entity67 , said : ' a @entity8 is already a work of art in itself , one that transports both its beholder and its driver into new dimensions of reality			2
' i realised how i could translate my passion for mathematical equations and scientific treatises into three - dimensional form			0
' my works are usually self - referential			0
so i found the idea of translating the equations of the @entity8 engineers onto the bodywork of the car very appealing			2
' a standard @entity81 costs £ 1.5 million with the firm not releasing a price for its one - off @entity85 edition , which is currently on display at at the @entity87 in @entity88			1
the car has been dubbed the world 's fastest piece of art			0

252mph car was *customised* by @entity26 artist @entity16
both the bodywork and interior are decorated with complex formulae
the @entity8 is a one - off version of the standard £ 1.5m @entity12 , and is currently on display in a @entity88 *museum*
