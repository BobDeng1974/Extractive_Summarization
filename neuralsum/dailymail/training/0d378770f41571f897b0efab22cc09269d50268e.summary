there were times at @entity2 on thursday afternoon when @entity3 gave the impression that there was so much more he wanted to say about the four years he spent at @entity7			1
the new @entity9 manager made it clear that the supporters at @entity14 - ‘ i ’d be foolish to pretend everything was hunky dory and i was happy - go - lucky ’ - got on his goat			1
they were his buzzwords at his @entity9 unveiling and it felt as though he had memorised them			1
@entity3 smiles for the camera during his unveiling as manager of the south @entity28 club @entity7 owner @entity29 ( right ) and @entity3 did not see eye to eye on financial aspects ‘ my resilience and character have grown because of the nature of @entity7 as a club , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ four years under that monetary situation , along with the history , made it difficult			0
it was the right time ( to leave ) for @entity7 and the right time for me			2
‘ you have to deliver but that does n’t mean it goes away			0
‘ defeats hurt , particularly defeats in derbies and in the cups			0
‘ @entity46 the local media up there did n’t help me			0
‘ that was difficult and they looked at a lot of negative situations , which did n’t help with the fans			0
‘ that was stuff i had to put up with and deal with			0
what i know is that on day one i have 99.9 per cent of the @entity9 fans but it wo n’t last if we do n’t serve up the best football we can			2
’ what was clear , despite the trauma of the @entity63 campaign , is that he actually has a lot of affection for @entity14 and the @entity67			2
he wanted to be respected and loved , but @entity7 ’s fans refused to yield			2
@entity3 takes in the views at @entity2 where he 'll manage @entity9 , who are in the relegation zone he acknowledges the travelling @entity9 fans in the @entity73 at @entity74 , his first game in charge ‘ i want to prove that i am a top manager in this division , ’ he added , ‘ and it would have been easier to stay at @entity7 and get a top - 10 finish			1
‘ i managed in a difficult situation and with a difficult agenda			0
’ that agenda is set by @entity83 owner @entity29 , who wants to recoup his huge interest - free loan to the club before thinking about building a team for the city to be proud of again			0
as an aside , @entity3 did make it clear that he had control of team selection and the final say on major transfers , with the exception of @entity96 ’s departure last january			1
still , he can look forward to a warmer relationship with the supporters at @entity2			0
he mentioned the @entity99 , the growing group of @entity9 fans who make a racket for 90 minutes at every home game			1
it is something @entity3 wants to tap in to			2
last season he was in the directors ’ box when @entity9 , under @entity107 , came back from 0 - 3 to draw 3 - 3 with @entity108 and admitted he had been stirred by the atmosphere			1
@entity3 , with @entity7 owner @entity29 ( right ) , claims the financial constraints were too much at the club @entity113 celebrates with team - mates after scoring @entity9 's opener against @entity74 on sunday ‘ i could n’t help but feel enthused , even though i was @entity7 ’s manager , ’ he said			1
@entity3 is back home , sort of , returning to the club where he made @entity9 history by scoring the winner in the @entity73 semi-final against @entity108 in 1990			1
‘ it was a day that none of us ever believed we could win , ’ he recalled			0
‘ we over-achieved , against the odds , against one of the finest sides @entity129 football has produced			0
‘ under @entity130 the following season we finished third			0
it brings strong memories of the red and blue and what @entity9 should be about - front - foot football - and i want to bring that in , in a structured manner			1
’ keeping @entity9 in the @entity138 is a tougher job than many may believe , but @entity3 ’s strength is his coaching ability			1
when his eye is on the ball , he is exceptional on the training ground			0
@entity3 waves to the away supporters during @entity9 's @entity73 trip to @entity74 on sunday afternoon @entity9 winger @entity149 had to be restrained by team - mate @entity150 ( right ) at the darts ‘ i ’m under no illusions but it is my job to set up a football team , to motivate them and to achieve more than they are , ’ he added			1
‘ that is my big strength			0
’ @entity3 has also brought discipline , calling midfielder @entity149 into his office this week after he was involved in an unseemly exchange with a spectator at the @entity164 final			2
‘ i reminded him that he has a responsibility as a @entity9 player			2
his behaviour was inappropriate and i told him , ’ said @entity3			2
this was a good start by @entity3 , careful with his farewell words for @entity7 fans while eager to make a fresh start with @entity9			1
as for the rest of it , he will be judged on results .			0
