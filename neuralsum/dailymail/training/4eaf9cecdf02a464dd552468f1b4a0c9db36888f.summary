by @entity0 crammed full of dusty syringes , bottled antidotes , and rattling equipment - with a half - smoked pipe on the table - the owner of this doctor 's surgery could have just popped out			1
but in fact it has lain derelict for more than a decade - and gathered a thick layer of dust over the years			1
abandoned in mysterious circumstances , the mansion in @entity14 , @entity15 , still has semi-full glasses of wine on the tables , and meticulously ordered equipment in antique glass cabinets smothered in cobwebs			1
@entity24 era : the equipment in this old doctor 's surgery in @entity14 , @entity15 , was left in perfect order when it was abandoned in 1980 - despite slight decay ghost - like : the doctor 's unfinished cigar , glasses and newspaper were left on the table as if he were half - way through his morning reading @entity37 photographer @entity36 , 27 , who found the home , said : ' this one is a strange for me , as it seems to be part home , part office and part surgery			1
' it really felt odd wandering around , as it was as if the owner had just left for a paper and would return at any moment - the only way to tell otherwise was the layer of dust covering the contents of the property			0
' the surgery area was very interesting as there was old equipment left behind , and it was all neatly laid out			2
historic : the medicines cluttered around the house look ancient compared to our plastic packets today			0
syringes and scalpels lie sprawled over glass - topped desks not quite the @entity64 : patients would recline in a king size bed with plush blue satin sheets and a gold wooden frame facing the open windows mysteriously , open bottles and half - filled glasses remain on the tables , with coats slung on the back of the beautiful , velvet chairs ' but , to be honest , with it being a multi-use building there was much to see , all of which seemed as though it was very well cared for when the owner was still there			2
' seemingly abandoned at some point in the 1980s , the house in the south of @entity15 has been dubbed ' dr @entity87 's mansion ' and is made up of three stories - part residential and part surgery			2
mr @entity36 , 27 , says : ' i receive a very mixed reaction from people who see these photographs			0
' some love to see them and hear the tales of what once may have gone on in there			0
although , some will just never understand why i find these places interesting			0
' i really enjoy capturing places that once were loved but now have been left for @entity102 to reclaim			0
' the house has become local legend , with many stories circulated about what could have happened to the family that left without notice or trace @entity37 photographer @entity36 discovered a home ' reclaimed by @entity102 ' as he was investigating the myth of ' dr @entity113 ' classic : a typical doctor 's briefcase gathers dust on a chair in the corner of an office memories : boxes of photographs all over the house span generations , including the family 's landmarks events like weddings , births and birthdays			1
