the ' campaign ' continues against @entity1 when it comes to penalties â€“ although in a first half with four penalty appeals it was clear that referee , @entity7 was only going to award what he felt was a stonewall spot kick and there was only one of those			1
the @entity14 had a good shout for an early penalty when @entity17 was clipped by @entity18 but i agreed with @entity7 that the contact was accidental and minimal - a penalty would have been very harsh			0
@entity7 was more decisive when @entity22 went to ground after feeling contact from @entity24			0
the fall was exaggerated and theatrical and that might have influenced @entity7 as he cautioned the @entity28 for simulation			0
@entity1 should have had a penalty when @entity32 forward @entity17 nicked the ball past @entity34 the @entity36 goalkeeper clattered @entity17 , who was left with a possible concussion and replaced at half time replays proved that to be incorrect as they showed slight contact on @entity22 ' knee - perhaps not enough for a penalty but certainly enough contact to make the caution incorrect			1
@entity36 had an appeal of their own when the ball span up and caught @entity48 on the arm but again i thought @entity7 was right as @entity48 was very close to the @entity36 player and his arm was not in an unnatural position			0
there was only one clear penalty for me when @entity17 was played clean through on goal and lobbed @entity34 the @entity36 keeper clearly wiped @entity17 out and @entity7 should have given them a penalty			2
@entity7 may well have been waiting to see if @entity17 's lob went in the goal but once it was cleared he should have gone back , awards the penalty and cautioned @entity34			2
@entity17 had gone down earlier in the half under the slightest of contact from @entity18 @entity22 was booked after appearing to kick his leg out to find contact from @entity24 replays showed that there was some contact on @entity22 , and therefore the booking for diving was harsh @entity24 's shot hit @entity48 's arm , but the @entity1 man was too close to have deliberately handled			1

@entity1 had three appeals for penalties turned down in first half
@entity22 was *wrongly* booked for diving , but no penalty was right
@entity17 should have been given a penalty for foul by @entity34
