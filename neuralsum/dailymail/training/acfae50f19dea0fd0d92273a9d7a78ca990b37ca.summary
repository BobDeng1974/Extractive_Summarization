by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 13 september 2013 this is the spectacular moment twin waterspouts formed over @entity3			1
the funnels of water , created when tornadoes develop above the sea , were captured towering over the lake off the @entity10 shore , near the city of @entity12			1
they were sighted a couple of miles off shore , spinning above the water under a large mushroom cloud			1
they are most common in the @entity41 , where there can be as many as 500 each year			0
an eye - witness managed to capture video footage of the breathtaking moment , which was released by @entity46 yesterday			1
waterspouts , which can spin as fast as 80 miles an hour , occur when a tornado forms over oceans , lakes or other bodies of water			2
layers of cool air blowing over the water cause warm , moist air to sweep up from underneath and form a vortex of condensation			0
the twin waterspouts , which were spotted at @entity3 at about 1.30pm ( 7.30pm gmt ) on thursday , were a result of ideal weather conditions , according to a @entity63 @entity62 meteorologist			0
he said warmer lake temperatures and very cold air higher up in the atmosphere had combined to make the air unstable - leading to the formation of the waterspouts			2
the twin funnels , which initially merged into one large waterspout before splitting , were not expected to spin on to land			0
however , more were predicted throughout the day			0
the waterspouts formed after warmer lake temperatures combined with very cold air higher up in the atmosphere , according to a @entity63 @entity62 meteorologist waterspouts can spin as fast as 80 miles an hour , with inside winds spiraling from 60 to 120 miles an hour			2

the breathtaking moment was captured on *camera* by an eye - witness
