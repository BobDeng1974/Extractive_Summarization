by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:03 am on 28th january 2012 for 18 years @entity2 was forced to relocate through six states as a crazed stalker tracked her every move			1
each time she moved her life and switched jobs , homes and even states the terrified yoga instructor prayed it would be her last relocation			2
and each and very time twisted stalker @entity12 would hunt her down			1
safe at last : @entity2 , 45 , was stalked by @entity15 for 18 years @entity12 's reign of terror began after he enjoyed a stroll through @entity18 with the former elementary school teacher			1
they knew each other through shared membership of a running club , but after the walk in the park the @entity24 decided she did not want to take the friendship any further			2
it was then that the trouble began as the then @entity31 resident would n't take no for an answer and began a spiralling hate campaign that would last almost half his victim 's lifetime			2
@entity2 , now 45 , said : ' he showed up at my place of work			2
he showed up at my school , at my apartment - he showed up on the subway platform			2
he stalked me all over @entity44			1
' i was terrified of him			0
' @entity12 tormented her for six months before he found her living in @entity46 , @entity47 and later in @entity48 , @entity49			1
finally after almost 20 years of protracted and prolonged harrassment across the @entity51 @entity12 has been found guilty of federal stalking charges			1
@entity2 , who was 27 when she agreed to the innocent stroll , said of their first meeting : ' it was fine			0
we just walked around @entity18 , got to know each other			0
i just decided on that date that he did n’t interest me at all			0
' but @entity12 - who claims to have ' an @entity62 education ' - did n't get the message and began hounding his victim as she moved across statelines to escape him			1
innocent stroll : @entity12 would not take no for an answer after his victim decided not to pursue their friendship after a walk in @entity18 in @entity44 the teacher - turned - fitness instructor spent two decades moving to @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity47 and @entity49 after she abandoned @entity44			1
and as soon as @entity75 found her he would again bombard her with phone calls , emails , letters , cds and porn			0
he would wait until restraining orders would run out and then restart his vile crusade renewing his fantasy of reuniting with her			0
his terrified victim even ensured that all official records for her showed that she lived with her parents in @entity89 , @entity73			1
but nothing could stop him			0
it was when he tracked her down to yet another home in @entity49 in february 2010 with a chilling death threat that she feared he might kill her			1
she explained : ' he said he ’s ‘ coming for me			0
’ and that ’s when i feared for my life			0
he came here ; he scoped out my house ; he scoped out my work			2
he ’s never taken no for an answer			0
' police then arrested @entity12 at his @entity73 home in may 2010 and alerted the @entity106			1
he now faces five years behind bars following a federal trial			1
@entity2 added : ' i hope that justice is served and that there ’s more awareness that stalking is a serious crime			0
' and she said : ' i was trying to get him to stop , and he wo n’t			0
but i ’m also just a really positive , strong person , and i try to live my life as normally as i can			0

@entity118 moved from @entity44 to @entity47 , @entity72 and @entity73 to escape @entity12
he scoped out her home before *issuing* a death threat
now he faces five years behind bars
