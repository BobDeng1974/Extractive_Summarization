by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 insists he ’s ‘ just a normal person ’			1
when pressed about his life he says ‘ i ’m just … nothing special , you know ’			0
let ’s reappraise that modest statement			2
he is a normal person , but one with an outside chance of winning @entity8 at on sunday			0
and , despite his protestations , he is very special indeed			0
@entity2 gatecrashed the top of the leaderboard at @entity12 after a third round 68 left him in fifth , eight shots behind @entity16 with 18 holes to play			1
but whether or not the fairytale victory comes , @entity2 is set for a year to remember			1
talent : @entity20 's @entity2 is now a near - certainty to qualify for @entity24 's @entity23 team the 24 - year - old from @entity26 has now announced his talent to the world			1
a former amateur no 1 , @entity2 ’s first big victory came over @entity31 and a quality field in @entity33 last november , and his short - game magic mesmerised in the final of the @entity36 in february			1
@entity2 is now proving he can challenge at major championships and is now a near - certainty to qualify for @entity24 ’s @entity23 team at @entity39			1
but , first things first , can he lift the @entity41 today ? ‘ i ’ll just try to do my best , ’ he says			0
‘ if the putts go in , it can be a good day			0
’ battle : @entity45 and @entity2 can expect to go head - to - head at @entity39 he says he can handle the pressure on the biggest stages , whether at @entity12 or in @entity49 this autumn			1
‘ if the crowd is big , it ’s not really a big difference , ’ he claims			2
‘ i really focus on my game on the course			0
’ as chance would have it , @entity2 played alongside @entity45 , who is nailed - on to be a rookie on the @entity59 team in september			1
@entity45 had a flying start , but no birdies in his closing 13 holes mean the 35 - year - old @entity64 is out of the running			2
‘ i ’m pretty bummed about the way the round finished , ’ he admitted			0
disappointment : @entity68 slid down the leaderboard after a birdieless front nine on saturday he has formed the basis of a friendship with his @entity24 counterpart over the past few weeks , having played together at the @entity74			2
‘ @entity2 ’s a nice guy , he ’s quiet , i enjoy playing with him , ’ said @entity45			1
of course , that will be forgotten in the maelstrom of intercontinental matchplay , as @entity45 coldly insists : ‘ i ’m confident taking anybody on			0
’ @entity68 , their playing partner , slid down the leaderboard after a birdie-less front nine and looked disconsolate after a double bogey on the 10th			0
but a birdie on the 11th and four more on the back nine lifted the spirits			0
@entity68 needs a miracle but is still fighting at six under par. @entity2 , at eight under par , still has hopes of a maiden major			2
this small battle has been won by @entity24 , but there are plenty more in store at @entity39 .			1

@entity2 moved up to fifth , eight shots behind @entity16 with 18 to play at @entity12
@entity20 is is now a near - certainty to qualify for @entity24 ’s @entity23 team at @entity39
