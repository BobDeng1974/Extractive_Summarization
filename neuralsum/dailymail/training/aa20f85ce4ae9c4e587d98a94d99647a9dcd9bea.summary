one in five adults apparently believe that parsnips grow on trees			1
the statistic is the most shocking in a survey that reveals a bewildering level of consumer ignorance on fruit and vegetables			0
one in twenty adults are completely embarrassed by their lack of knowledge about where certain food , like the parsnip , comes from twenty per cent think that melons grow in the soil and ten per cent believe tomatoes have to be dug up			1
a quarter of adults admit to being stumped when a child asks them where a certain food comes from			1
a fifth have never heard of a @entity30 or a @entity31 and five per cent think a @entity33 is a potato			1
the research , which was carried out among 2,000 adults , was commissioned by the @entity37 to celebrate the launch of a new potato classification system			1
@entity40 from @entity37 said : ' our research shows that some @entity44 adults need to brush up on their foodie knowledge			2
' it ’s worrying to think that there are people out there who believe types of apples to be potatoes and that well known varieties of @entity44 grown spuds are unheard of			2
' there is plenty of information available , such as our new potato classification guide , so they can read up - especially if children are inquisitive enough to ask where food comes from			2
' it also emerged one in twenty adults are completely embarrassed by their lack of knowledge and a quarter said they regularly come unstuck when kids ask them where certain food comes from			2
the survey found that some people believe types of apples to be potatoes and that well known varieties of @entity44 grown spuds are unheard of cooking is an issue too - despite being one of the nation ’s favourite ingredients , one in twenty adults still admit to struggling to cook potatoes			1
half claim that their roasts are n’t fluffy enough , 28 per cent say their mash is n’t smooth enough and 34 per cent struggle to get their boiled potatoes to hold their shape			0
the study found the hardest vegetable to cook was asparagus , followed by the swede			0
@entity40 added : ' potatoes are one of the most versatile foods - they can be used to create so many tasty dishes and being naturally fat free , they ’re a nutritious base for lots of meals too			0
' to get great results you need to pick the right type			0
varieties are a good guide but , as the survey shows , not everyone is aware of them , so our classification system has been introduced to make it even easier for you to pick the potato that ’s right for your dish every time			0

3 out of 10 adults do *n't* know how potatoes grow
1 in 10 think tomatoes are *harvested* from the ground
