by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 15 march 2014 updated : 08:22 est , 15 march 2014 home secretary @entity2 has warned that people travelling from @entity4 to @entity5 will be forced to show their passports if the country becomes independent @entity4 will be forced to show their passports when visiting relatives and friends in @entity5 if the country becomes independent , home secretary @entity2 has warned			1
in a major intervention in the referendum debate , the @entity12 mp yesterday insisted that @entity15 would erect border posts near @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
first minister @entity20 has said a separate @entity21 would not ‘ kick out ’ migrants and would welcome more foreigners			1
@entity25 ministers are convinced that , without border controls , a separate @entity4 would become a ‘ back door ’ to @entity5 for migrants			2
mrs may told delegates at the @entity4 @entity12 conference that criminals would seek to ‘ exploit ’ the @entity33			1
passport checks would force drivers to pull over on key roads to the south such as the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , while train passengers would have to endure @entity43 - style checks			1
mr @entity20 has claimed that an independent @entity4 could join the @entity44 alongside @entity45 and the remainder of the @entity25 , where there are no border posts			1
however , the @entity51 government ’s immigration policies deliberately do not diverge greatly from @entity15 ’s			2
in contrast , mr @entity20 wants to lift restrictions on @entity55 immigration by relaxing the rules on minimum salary levels for entry			2
mrs may said : ‘ if the people of @entity4 vote to leave the @entity25 , there would be profound changes for migration policy			1
an international border would be created where one does not currently exist			0
passports please : mrs may told delegates at the @entity4 @entity12 conference that criminals would seek to ' exploit ' the border warning : the @entity12 mp yesterday insisted that @entity15 would erect border posts near @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 ( pictured ) ‘ this would have implications for people travelling to visit family , go on holiday or do business – and for our economies more generally			1
‘ buried deep in @entity20 ’s @entity80 is the admission that , just like the last @entity82 , a separate @entity4 would pursue a looser immigration policy			1
t pledge : @entity4 's first minister @entity20 has said a separate @entity21 would not ' kick out ' migrants and would welcome more foreigners ' hat would undermine the work we have done since 2010 , and the continuing @entity25 could not allow @entity4 to become a convenient landing point for migration into the @entity25			1
‘ so that would mean border controls			0
@entity95 checks to visit friends and relatives			0
a literal and figurative barrier between our nations			0
’ there are an estimated 23million vehicle crossings per year in both directions and seven million rail passenger journeys			0
the 800,000 @entity4 who live south of the @entity33 , and the 400,000 @entity5 people who live in @entity4 would be particularly inconvenienced when trying to visit friends and relatives			2
in her wide - ranging speech , mrs may also claimed the battle against crime could be harmed by @entity4 independence			2
‘ criminals do not respect borders but rather work to exploit them , ’ she said			0
‘ never before has crime been so international			0
organised criminal networks , and the internet , mean that people on the other side of the world can orchestrate crimes without even setting foot in this country			0
‘ so we should n’t make life any easier for them by erecting another international border in the middle of our @entity25			0
‘ @entity128 bring with them bureaucracy , delays and legal impediments			0
for instance , police officers from the @entity25 and a separate @entity4 state would no longer have powers to arrest or detain criminals in each others ’ jurisdictions			0

@entity12 mp insisted @entity15 would erect border posts if @entity4 vote yes
they would be set up at near @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19
drivers would have to pull over while rail passengers would have to endure @entity43 - style checks
@entity4 first minister @entity20 said an independent @entity4 could join the @entity44
