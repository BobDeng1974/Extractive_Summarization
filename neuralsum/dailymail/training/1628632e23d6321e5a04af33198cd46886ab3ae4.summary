the bra the hospital gave me to wear while i recovered was so uncomfortable			2

i realised i needed to come up with a new design			0
' in her former career , @entity20 modelled lingerie and swimwear for magazines including @entity49			2

' in school , i was badly bullied			0
the girls suggested i was padding my bra , while boys just did n't leave me alone			2
' worst of all was the agonising pain			0
my breasts were just far too big for my frame , leading to chronic back and neck ache			0
' she was eventually approved for @entity31 surgery in march 2012 to reduce her breasts from size @entity23 to @entity28			1
she said : ' lying in my hospital bed , i struggled with the post-operation pain			0
my chest was unbearably sore and tender			0
' what made matters worse was that the standard recovery bras i was advised to wear by the hospital were incredibly uncomfortable			0
' the bras available were very difficult to put on , were n't easily adjustable and quite inaccessible for medical staff when it came to changing dressings and aftercare			0
' i realised my uncomfortable bra was the last thing i should be worrying about			0
so i took out my notebook and designed a completely new bra			2

if the bra i 've designed can do anything to help them , then i consider myself very lucky			2
