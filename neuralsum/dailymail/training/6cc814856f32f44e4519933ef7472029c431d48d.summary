@entity0 was brutally honest in his assessment , summing up the feelings of most @entity4 fans			1
' we were nowhere near our capacity and it has been like that for much of the season , ' he said after sunday 's match against @entity11			2
it was easy to forget they 'd actually won the match			0
skipper @entity15 was even more to the point in his analysis			0
' everything needs improving , ' he thundered			0
on wednesday night , the champions of @entity37 @entity36 come calling			2
it is a wonderful , glamorous tie - the raison d'etre for a competition like the @entity41			2
the whole world will be watching @entity43 , fascinated			0
but on current form , things could get pretty messy for @entity4			2
their defence has looked vulnerable all season - managing to keep just one clean sheet so far - and now @entity27 , @entity31 and co come up against the most feared forward line in world football			1
@entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and their team - mates have already racked up 40 goals in 13 matches this season and have won their last two matches 5 - 0			1
@entity31 hacks the ball away as @entity4 struggle to clear their lines during the @entity11 match @entity36 's fearsome attack , including @entity68 ( left ) , @entity53 ( centre ) and @entity55 are next up for @entity4 in the @entity41 @entity53 already has 15 goals in seven @entity72 matches this season @entity4 will be relieved that @entity54 will likely be sidelined for the match at @entity43 video real ready for tough week - @entity19 it will come as some relief to @entity4 that @entity54 is sidelined with a gluteal muscle injury , but @entity77 , @entity68 , @entity78 and @entity79 are just some of the other attacking options at @entity36 's disposal			1
the goals could come from anywhere			0
@entity4 's central defensive partnership of @entity31 and @entity27 has looked vulnerable all season and showed their weakness again when @entity26 shook them off to bring @entity11 level at 2 - 2 in the 92nd minute on sunday			1
@entity27 , who cost @entity4 Â£ 20m in the summer , lacked any kind of command at @entity30 , with far too many clearances landing at the feet of opposition players			2
he was bullied by @entity93			0
@entity31 , too , struggled to contain the @entity11 captain and was also at fault for @entity97 's winner in @entity4 's last @entity41 outing			1
with all due respect , if they ca n't cope with @entity11 's attackers , what hope is there against @entity36 ? @entity11 striker @entity93 gives @entity31 the run around during sunday 's match @entity27 also struggled to contain @entity93 in the match at @entity30 on sunday @entity0 played @entity107 and @entity108 out wide , with @entity109 left on the bench and @entity111 not in the squad			1
whoever occupies those positions on wednesday will have to be on top form			0
@entity4 are likely to be pinned inside their own half for long spells , even though they are at home , and their fragility is alarming at times			0
@entity23 , the goalkeeper , remains vulnerable with crosses and his inconsistent performances were heavily criticised by @entity123 pundit @entity122 after the 1 - 1 derby draw with @entity125			1
real are in ominous form			0
@entity53 has 15 goals in seven league matches after his double in saturday 's five - goal thrashing of @entity131 and will score over 70 this season if keep up this rate			1
the team as a whole may well end up close to 150 across all competitions - they put eight past @entity138 and have smashed five against each of @entity97 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity131			1
they are gradually beginning to play like they did at the end of last season , when they won the @entity147 and their historic 10th @entity41			0
@entity23 clatters in to @entity31 as he tries to collect the ball @entity55 celebrates after scoring in @entity36 's 5 - 0 rout of @entity131 on saturday @entity150 loanee @entity68 has also been given a new lease of life at the @entity153 @entity78 has also impressed since his summer move from @entity155 one man who will particularly relish the @entity43 visit is striker @entity68 , on loan from @entity150			1
@entity68 scored on saturday , taking his tally to three , and the @entity160 has been given a fresh lease of life by the temporary move away from @entity164			0
@entity78 , who joined from @entity155 in the summer , had a near - 100 per cent passing record against @entity131 , while @entity55 looks every inch a @entity36 player and gave a fine performance with licence to attack at the weekend			2
@entity77 should recover from the fever that kept him out of the last match to offer @entity19 yet another dangerous option			0
five years ago , @entity4 thrashed real 4 - 0 on a glorious night at @entity43			1
current form suggests that scoreline might be the other way round on wednesday night .			0

@entity4 host in - form @entity36 in @entity41 on wednesday
@entity0 was *highly* critical of his team despite 3 - 2 win at @entity11
@entity31 and @entity27 look especially vulnerable at centre - half
goalkeeper @entity23 continues to struggle in the air
@entity4 have kept just one clean sheet all season
@entity36 have already scored 40 goals in all competitions
they thrashed @entity131 5 - 0 on saturday , @entity53 scoring twice
