there 's nothing more seductive than a juicy pair of pouting lips , so it 's no wonder a survey found that 63 per cent of women would like to plump up their own pair			1
but despite our lust for luscious lips only 7 per cent of women said they had no qualms with lip fillers , 15 per cent were on the fence and 78 per cent of us gave it a big thumbs down due to potential trout pout , health risks and cost			1
the survey by leading beauty retailer @entity21 questioned 1,000 women about their lip preferences			1
well over half of women ( 60 per ecnt ) said their main reason for steering clear of the cosmetic treatment was fear ' trout pout ' - the wonky , disproportionate mouth that can sometimes result from the treatment			1
the latest celebrity victim of the ' trout pout ' was @entity48 , who appeared swollen mouthed at her recent court appearance			2
the only way is @entity52 star @entity35 ( left ) and celebrity @entity54 contestant @entity53 ( right ) were voted as having second and third worst lips respectively @entity36 ( left ) and @entity56 ( right ) came fourth and fifth on the ' worst lips ' list other reasons women gave for avoiding lip fillers were the potential health risks ( 29 % ) and the hefty costs of regular top - up injections ( 9 per cent )			1
injectable lip fillers – often made from collagen , hyaluronic acid or @entity67 - usually last from several weeks to up to four months before the plumping effects fade and the treatment has to be repeated			1
rather than opting for surgery , over half of women ( 52 per cent ) said they had tried make - up tricks to fake a fuller pout			0
@entity75 , editor at @entity21 , said : ' it ’s definitely possible to create the illusion of plumper looking lips without having to resort to injectables			0
' applying lip liner just outside your natural lip line in a shade close to or slightly darker than your lip colour works wonders			0
finish off with a moisturising lip colour in a light or natural hue – darker lipsticks can sometimes make lips appear smaller than they are			0
' and the award for best lips goes to : @entity93 ( left ) and @entity94 ( right ) in third and fourth place : @entity96 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) ' another great tip is to add a touch of pearlescent highlighter to the centre of your lips and @entity105 ’s bow			2
' there are a range of highly effective products out there specifically targeted at creating fuller lips			0
' some provide a natural plumping effect by feeding the delicate area around the mouth with nutrients , like @entity116 ( £ 9.50 from @entity21 )			0
others nourish the lips themselves , such as @entity119 ( £ 18 from @entity120 )			0
@entity21 also questioned women on the celebrities whose lips they most envied			0
supermodel @entity93 came out on top , with newlywed @entity94 – long famed for her full pout – close behind			2
@entity48 was voted celebrity with the least attractive lips , followed by @entity129 contestant @entity53 , who is also reported to have had lip injections			1
unsurprisingly , nearly all of the women surveyed thought @entity48 was wrong to tamper with her lips – 96 per cent of women said she looked prettier before the fillers			2
go forth and plump - ify ! @entity93 @entity94 @entity97 @entity96 @entity136 @entity48 @entity53 @entity35 @entity36 @entity56			1

a survey of 1,000 women found 63 % would like fuller lips
