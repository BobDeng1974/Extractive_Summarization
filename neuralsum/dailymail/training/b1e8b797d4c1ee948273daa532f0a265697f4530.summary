we all know restaurant staff are overworked , but one man has taken things to a new level			2
a @entity6 video shows a man ' washing up ' almost 50 plates in ten seconds - and not smashing a single one			1
the plates almost combine into a blur as they fly out of the mystery man 's hands , landing in a bowl full of water apparently unmarked			0
one , @entity32 , wrote : ' he just threw the plates into the water but there was not washing in the video at all ! ' @entity37 added : ' i can also throw 100 plates into some water			1
where 's the trick ? as if they are clean			0
' and stone5against1 wrote : ' now do this again , with dishes that were used to serve eggs and other sticky things			0
seriously it does n't count if the dishes werent even dirty or got pre-scrubbed to begin with			0
' the video 's origin is unknown - but its so - far anonymous star has been dubbed the ' @entity53 of dishwashing '			2
@entity56 users have already asked if he can be hired for @entity58 or @entity59			1
thorough ? many @entity30 users questioned whether the man could possibly have got the plates clean speedy : the super-dishwasher 's stack is quickly depleted and he is left only to rinse the plates in the sink mystery : so far the man 's identity is unknown - but he would come in very useful after a @entity58 dinner			1

video has been seen more than 100,000 times on @entity30
@entity56 users want to know if he is free for @entity59 or @entity58
but some have questioned whether he did a *proper* job
