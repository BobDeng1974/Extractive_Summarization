the number of poor people in @entity2 is 3 million higher than the official count , encompassing 1 in 6 residents due to out - of - pocket medical costs and work - related expenses , according to a revised census measure released wednesday			1
the new measure is aimed at providing a fuller picture of poverty , but does not replace the official government numbers			2
put in place two years ago by the @entity15 administration , it generally is considered more reliable by social scientists because it factors in living expenses as well as the effects of government aid , such as food stamps and tax credits			2
administration officials have declined to say whether the new measure eventually could replace the official poverty formula , which is used to allocate federal dollars to states and localities and to determine eligibility for safety - net programs , such as @entity30			1
@entity31 would have to agree to adopt the new measure , which generally would result in a higher poverty rate from year to year and thus higher government payouts for aid programs			1
based on the revised formula , the number of poor people in 2012 was 49.7 million , or 16 percent			1
that exceeds the record 46.5 million , or 15 percent , that was officially reported in september			1

new @entity43 survey says the official rate of poverty in @entity2 is astronomically higher than what is officially recorded statistics : the new @entity43 report details the factors stopping people from getting out of poverty as well as the ones causing them to fall into it the latest numbers come as more working - age adults picked up low - wage jobs in the slowly improving economy but still struggled to pay living expenses			1
@entity2 65 and older had the largest increases in poverty under the revised formula , from 9.1 percent to 14.8 percent , because of medical expenses such as @entity64 premiums , deductibles and other costs not accounted for in the official rate			2
there also were increases for @entity70 and @entity71 , partly due to lower participation among immigrants and non-english speakers in government aid programs such as housing aid and food stamps			0
african - americans and children , helped by government benefits , had declines in poverty compared with the official rate			1
' this is a real incongruity , when 1 in 6 people face economic insecurity here in the richest country in the world , ' said @entity89 , a @entity90 economist and former chairman of the @entity92 , who has argued for more government action to alleviate income inequality			1
' when so many citizens are worse off year after year , with food insecurity and health care insecurity , there 's no way you can say that 's a successful economy			0
' last week , more than 47 million @entity2 who receive food stamps saw their benefits go down , while @entity31 began negotiations on further cuts of up to $ 4 billion annually to the program			1

new figures say the state has the highest level of poor people among states , @entity114 had the highest share of poor people , hurt in part by high housing costs and large numbers of immigrants , followed by the @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			1
under the official poverty rate , more rural states were more likely to be at the top of list , led by @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			1
some other findings were : - food stamps helped lift about 5 million people above the poverty line			1
without such aid , the overall poverty rate would increase from 16 percent to 17.6 percent			0
- working - age adults ages 18 - 64 saw an increase in poverty from 13.7 percent based on the official calculation to 15.5 percent , due mostly to commuting and child care costs			2
- child poverty declined from 22.3 percent to 18 percent under the new measure			0
under both measures , children still remained the age group most likely to be living in poverty			0
- by race , hispanics and @entity154 saw higher rates of poverty , 27.8 percent and 16.7 percent respectively , compared with rates of 25.8 percent and 11.8 percent under the official formula			2
in contrast , @entity160 - @entity2 saw a modest decrease , from 27.3 percent to 25.8 percent based on the revised numbers			0
among non-hispanic whites , poverty rose from 9.8 percent to 10.7 percent			0
' the primary reason that poverty remains so high is that the benefits of a growing economy are no longer being shared by all workers as they were in the quarter - century following the end of @entity172 , ' said @entity173 , a @entity174 economist			0

a new study says that 1 in 6 @entity2 are poor ' given current economic conditions , poverty will not be substantially reduced unless government does more to help the working poor and those who are willing to work but can not find jobs			2
we must also expand the reach of our safety - net programs			0
' economists long have criticized the official poverty rate as inadequate			0
based on a half - century - old government formula , the official rate continues to assume the average family spends one - third of its income on food			1
those costs have declined to a much smaller share , more like one - seventh			0
in reaction to some of the criticism , the @entity15 administration in 2010 asked the @entity205 to develop a new poverty measure , based partly on recommendations made by the @entity208			0
the goal is to help lawmakers better gauge the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs			0
for instance , the new measure finds that if it were n't for @entity217 payments , the poverty rate would rise to 54.7 percent for people 65 and older and 24.5 percent for all age groups			0
refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit helped lift 9 million people above the poverty line			2
without the credits , child poverty would rise from 18 percent to 24.7 percent .			0

last government census recorded the number of poor people across the country as 46.5 million
new figures say the real number is a record - breaking 49.7 million
results come as @entity31 continues to negotiate further cuts of up to $ 4 billion annually for the food stamp program
@entity114 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 *earmarked* as having the highest shares of poor people per state
official list , however , says more rural states have higher poverty levels , lead by @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135
