if you have trouble coping with a spider in your bath , be glad you do n't live in the @entity5 tropical rainforest in @entity6			1
scientists have recently identified 30 new species of arachnid in less than a square mile of the mysterious forest in the southern part of @entity13			1
and they believe many more are yet to be discovered in the biodiversity hotspot - called @entity14 in ancient times , meaning a ' miraculous utopia ' and also known as ' the @entity18 and @entity19 '			1
above , one of the new species , @entity29 aspera many more spider species are yet to be discovered in the biodiversity hotspot of @entity5 , according to the team from the @entity33 with the @entity34			1
above , @entity35 the spiders ( including @entity37 , pictured ) were found in an area called @entity39			0
although it covers only about 200 hectares of @entity5 , @entity39 has yielded a collection of approximately 700 spider species the team , from the @entity33 with the @entity34 , have warned that the find highlights how many undiscovered creatures are being lost to the world for ever , due to the destruction of the rainforests for logging and farming			1
professor @entity49 , of the academy , based in @entity51 , said : ' the amazing biological diversity we have witnessed during our work on spiders in the area is perhaps only a part of what @entity5 tropical rainforests hold			1
' it is one of the few places in @entity6 that still maintains large tracts of tropical rainforest , and prof @entity49 and colleagues have been using multiple collecting methods there since 2006			0
the spiders were found in an area called @entity39 which , although covering only about 200 hectares of @entity5 , has yielded a collection of approximately 700 spider species			1
the site of the spider find ( above ) was called @entity72 in ancient times , meaning a ' miraculous utopia ' and is now known as ' the @entity18 and @entity19 ' prof @entity49 said there are another 100 new ones to be published soon			1
the team has published findings on about 250 new spider species , with the 30 currently described in @entity80 being a part of their ongoing work			1
prof @entity49 added : ' studying the flora and fauna in biodiversity hotspots like these attests to the importance of their preservations , and gives a sad insight of what was lost with the destruction of forests elsewhere			2
' in the 1940s and 1950s , @entity6 's @entity5 region was a remote tropical rainforest , @entity6 's only one			2
the team has published findings on about 250 new spider species , with the 30 currently described in @entity80 being a part of their ongoing work			1
above , @entity101 paracymbialis since then the government and people of @entity5 have begun a completely devastating assault on the environment			2
@entity106 and burn agriculture , and wholesale destruction of the tropical rainforest , has lifted much of the region out of abject poverty , but at a serious cost			0
today @entity5 is a shadow of its former self			0
new highways , tea plantations , rubber tree plantations and sugar cane dominate the landscape			0
rainforests once covered 14 per cent of the earth 's land surface			0
now they cover a mere 6 per cent and experts estimate the last remaining could be consumed in less than 40 years			0
nearly half of the world 's species of plants , animals and micro-organisms will be destroyed or severely threatened over the next quarter century due to the deforestation			2
a farmer watches the burning hillsides in @entity6 's @entity5 region it is estimated we are losing 137 plant , animal and insect species every single day , which amounts to 50,000 a year			2
as the rainforest species disappear , so do many possible cures for life - threatening diseases			0
currently , 121 prescription drugs sold worldwide come from plant - derived sources			0
while 25 per cent of @entity146 pharmaceuticals are derived from rainforest ingredients , less that 1 per cent of these tropical trees and plants have been tested by scientists .			0

discovered in @entity5 , known as ' the @entity18 and @entity19 ' in southern part of @entity13
scientists have collected 700 spider species there since 2006
team from @entity33 with the @entity34 will publish findings of another 100 species soon
they warned how undiscovered creatures are being lost to the world due to destruction of rainforests
