just one of more than 200 @entity2 interpreters who say they 've been threatened by the @entity3 for their work with @entity6 soldiers has been given a @entity6 visa			1
most have instead been simply told to change their mobile phone numbers and switch their usual routes to avoid being attacked , the @entity8 said			2
but they say the threat of violent reprisals from the @entity3 has grown since @entity6 forces finally withdrew from @entity14 last month			1
many fear for their lives			0
prince @entity17 directs two @entity2 men around a @entity20 cordon , with the help of an @entity2 interpreter , in 2008 : just one of 200 interpreters who say they 've been threatened have been granted a @entity6 visa one 25 - year - old who worked with @entity6 troops in @entity14 for three years and has been forced into hiding away from his wife and children told @entity8 he felt abandoned			1
' i have been facing very serious problems			0
the @entity3 know i have worked for the coalition forces and they are looking for me , ' he told the @entity8 ' defence editor @entity36			2
' they have tried a couple of attacks either to capture or kill me			0
that is the reason i am not staying at home and i tell nobody whenever i visit my home			0
' up to 600 @entity2 civilian workers are understood to be eligible for relocation to @entity6 under an immigration scheme available to those with at least a year 's continuous service who were still in their posts in december 2012			1
so far 31 former interpreters and their families have moved to the @entity6 under the scheme , the @entity8 reports			1
their residency visas last five years , at the end of which they will be expected to return to @entity2			0
but the system for assessing the risk to those who left the job before that date has been criticised by workers facing @entity3 violence as a result of their employment by the @entity20			2
that cut - off point , they say , excludes many of those most at risk – men who were the ' eyes and the ears ' of the @entity6 during the worst of the bloody fighting in @entity14 in the five years up to 2010 – and now live in fear after being forced to quit because of a campaign of terror by the @entity3			1
of more than 200 claims , seven were classified ' amber ' risk , qualifying them for assistance relocating within @entity2 , and just one case was put in the ' red ' bracket , meaning a move to the @entity6			1
@entity6 troops withdraw from @entity2 : since the @entity6 ended operations in the country last month , local former workers say threats and intimidation from the @entity3 have intensified last year a @entity91 investigation spoke to 31 current and former @entity6 military and intelligence interpreters in @entity2 and all claimed to be in fear of their lives after receiving specific and personal death threats			1
they described how their relatives had been killed and tortured by militants looking for them , how they have had to move home regularly and how their children have to be taken out of school			0
many said they had been regularly threatened by telephone voice and text messages despite repeatedly changing and destroying sim cards			0
in one of the most disturbing claims , some said they had been threatened by members of the @entity2 police and @entity113			0
some had already suffered appalling injuries working alongside @entity6 troops in combat situations			2
pictured left is @entity118 who lost part of his arm when he was blown up on patrol with @entity6 forces			1
right is @entity123 , who was also caught in an explosion			0
both had problems getting @entity6 visas in july the former @entity127 leader @entity127 accused the government of ' shaming the nation ' for failing to process visa applications for @entity2 interpreters quickly enough			2
last year @entity133 's great - grandson @entity132 , an @entity2 veteran , delivered a petition to @entity135 demanding asylum for those who helped @entity6 forces			1
the @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 have all granted asylum to interpreters who worked with their soldiers while fighting in @entity2			2
a @entity145 spokeswoman said : ' we take reports of threats and intimidation very seriously and investigate all cases thoroughly , taking action as appropriate in consultation with the @entity153 ( locally engaged civilian )			0
' the intimidation policy provides a robust and responsive means for addressing these concerns and we regularly encourage @entity157 to report any issues			0

former interpreters say they face greater threat since @entity6 forces withdrew
scheme to relocate to @entity6 only applies to those working in december 2012
that cut - off point , they say , excludes many of those most at risk
