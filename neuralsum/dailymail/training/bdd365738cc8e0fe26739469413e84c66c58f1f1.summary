by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 13:28 est , 21 october 2013 in what many will view as a victory for a simpler way of life , staunchly religious beekeepers who shun computers , televisions and mobile phones have scored a landmark triumph over the tax authorities			0
@entity11 and @entity12 , who run @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity15 , fiercely objected when @entity16 ( @entity16 ) demanded that the file their vat returns online			1
the couple , as devout members of the @entity20 , are convinced that @entity23 ’s second coming is imminent and view the internet as an intrusion of ‘ worldliness ’ into their lives of ‘ righteousness ’			2
a tax tribunal ruled @entity16 had violated the human rights of @entity20 beekeepers @entity11 and @entity12 by refusing to allow them to file their vat returns by post now , in a major embarrassment for @entity16 , a tax tribunal has ruled that its treatment of @entity39 and mrs @entity12 violated their human rights			1
mr @entity42 told the first - tier tribunal that he and wife abjure the use of computers , the internet , televisions and mobile phones in their home			2
the contents of some tv programmes and websites were ‘ contrary to the @entity59 ’s teachings ’ in his view and he wanted to ‘ protect his children from bad influences ’			0
the beekeeper said people were obsessed by their mobile phones - treating them as ‘ idols ’ - and that the flood of electronic communications had ‘ blinded the minds of non-believers ’ , giving them no time for religion in their lives			0
most businesses have been required by law to file their vat returns online since april last year , and @entity16 lawyers argued that the couple ’s stance was ‘ really a personal preference and not part of their religion			1
’ the beekeepers , who run @entity13 , refuse to use the internet or watch tv ( file picture ) @entity84 , for the tax authorities , pointed out that the @entity20 does not ban its members from using the internet - merely extoling them to avoid ‘ unwholesome ’ or ‘ sordid ’ influences in the mass media - and in fact has its own website			1
however , tribunal judge @entity91 ruled that by refusing to exempt @entity39 and mrs @entity12 from online filing , @entity16 had breached their right to freely manifest their religion , enshrined in @entity95 9 of the @entity96			1
she said the couple ’s decision not to use computers was more than just a preference to keep ‘ bad ’ content out of their home and away from their children but was an expression of their fundamental religious beliefs			0
she said : ' i find that , by entirely shunning computers , the @entity110 considered they were acting , as the @entity59 required them to do , in accordance with their religious conscience			0
' they were manifesting their religious beliefs by refusing to use computers			0
' justifications put forward by @entity16 for refusing to exempt the couple were ‘ clearly insufficient ’ , she concluded .			2

owners of @entity13 company refuse to use the internet
@entity11 and @entity12 members of @entity20
tax tribunal ruled that by refusing to allow them to file returns by post @entity16 violated their human rights to freely express their religion
