the @entity16 quoted the front - bencher as saying ' @entity80 is n’t going to get rid of @entity11 and @entity9 is n’t going to stop ' and goes on to quote another mp ' what is @entity9 supposed to do ? perform worse to make @entity83 look better by way of comparison ? ' but ms @entity11 told the newspaper that ' we continue to work in a close and collegial way , i admire @entity9 for her tenacity and skill as a minister '			2
@entity9 's office stands by her claim that she has not had any ' cross words ' with @entity11 and they have no idea where the suggestions of a bust - up have originated one front - bencher says @entity9 is unhappy at the level of control @entity11 as the pm 's chief of staff			1
