' he and his wife retired and moved to @entity89 in 2006			0
the @entity2 craze ' was great fun when it happened , ' his wife recalled in a telephone interview			1
over time , however , ' people would come to him with weird ideas , expecting him to do for them what he had done for himself			0
and a lot of times they were really , really stupid ideas			0
' by 1988 , @entity0 said he had avoided interviews for years because of what he called ' a bunch of wackos ' appearing out of nowhere with threats and lawsuits			0
