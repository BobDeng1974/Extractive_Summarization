if you fancy yourself as a modern - day @entity2 , then this could be your chance to prove your code - breaking skills			2
developed by mathematicians at the @entity7 , the quiz has been created to coincide with the launch of the film ‘ @entity10 ’			1
@entity12 codes are hidden in the below images			1
when combined , they reveal the coordinates of buried treasure in the map			1
scroll down for cryptic messages and video if you fancy yourself as a modern - day @entity2 , then this could be your chance to prove your code - breaking skills			2
when the codes are combined , they reveal the location of treasure on this map			1
larger version of the image can be viewed here the conundrum is based around a true story of how in 1940 , @entity2 converted his savings into silver ingots and buried them in @entity33			1
in real life the silver has never been found , but for the purposes of the competition , a location has been chosen and three coded clues are there to be deciphered			2
the film , starring @entity42 , tells the real - life story of mathematician @entity2 , who is credited with cracking the @entity45 @entity44			1
@entity12 codes are hidden in these images			1
the conundrum is based around a true story of how in 1940 , @entity2 converted his savings into silver ingots and buried them in @entity33 can you spot the hidden pattern in this image ? the quiz was created by mathematicians at @entity7			1

this quiz was inspired by @entity2 whose genius significantly shortened @entity61 it portrays the nail - biting race against time by @entity2 and his team at @entity67 's top - secret code - breaking centre , @entity33 , during @entity61 @entity2 ’s genius significantly shortened the war and saved thousands of lives , but his contribution was not recognised at the time			1
in 1952 , he was convicted of homosexual offences , and as an alternative to imprisonment accepted chemical castration with doses of the female hormone oestrogen			0
among the consequences , he developed female breasts			0
as well as a code breaker , @entity2 was a pioneer of artificial intelligence and mathematical biology			2
during his time at @entity7 , @entity2 proposed a famous experiment now known as the turing test what do you have to do ? decipher three coded clues and use them to find the location of the silver			2
once you have the solution , submit your answers here			0
who is eligible ? any resident of the @entity67 can enter the competition , but only one prize will be awarded per household			2
a complete set of rules is given here			0
what can you win ? the prizes will be film - related merchandise			0
winners will be selected by a random draw from all correct solutions			0
how long do you have ? the competition will close at midday on 28th november 2014			1
one day in 1954 , aged only 41 , he could bear his predicament no longer , and killed himself by eating an apple coated in cyanide			0
last year , the @entity111 granted a posthumous pardon for the wartime hero			0
as well as a code breaker , @entity2 was a pioneer of artificial intelligence and mathematical biology			0
during his time at @entity7 , @entity2 proposed a famous experiment now known as the turing test			2
this was his an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called ` intelligent ‘			0
the idea was that a computer could be said to ` think ’ if it could fool an interrogator into believing that the conversation was with a human			0
the quiz aims to highlight @entity2 ’s achievements			0
winners , who will be drawn at random from correct solutions , receive film - related merchandise			0
the @entity136 , open to @entity67 residents , will close at midday on 28th november 2014			1
developed by mathematicians at the @entity7 , the quiz has been created to coincide with the launch of the film ‘ @entity10 ’			1
the film , starring @entity42 ( right ) , tells the real - life story of mathematician @entity2 , who is credited with cracking the @entity45 @entity44			1

@entity12 codes are hidden in patterns within three separate images
when combined , they reveal coordinates of buried treasure on a map
conundrum is based on true story about @entity2 's lost treasure
it was created by @entity7 to coincide ‘ @entity10 '
the film portrays the life of the *codebreaker* @entity2 at @entity33
the competition for @entity67 residents will close at midday on 28th november
