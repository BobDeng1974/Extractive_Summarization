by @entity0 last updated at 12:32 pm on 8th december 2011 the @entity3 would not treat a dog as badly as it treated a woman who was forced to spend her final hours away from home after travelling to @entity7 to die , former @entity2 presenter @entity1 said today			1
former tv producer @entity8 , 61 , who was diagnosed with lung and liver cancer , called for a change to the law after travelling to a @entity14 clinic in @entity15 where she died yesterday			1
in a letter published hours after her death , ms @entity8 said she was not sad , but ' angry that because of the cowardice of our politicians i ca n't die in the country i was born in , in my own home '			1
' the professor of palliative medicine at @entity46 said : the law we have has a stern face but an understanding heart			2
' @entity51 has examined this subject in considerable depth , including the few jurisdictions where these practices have been legalised , and has concluded that legalisation is incompatible with protecting the public and especially its more vulnerable members			0
' @entity60 of @entity61 said publicity surrounding miss @entity8 's death were a carefully orchestrated move in collaboration with the pro-euthanasia lobby			2
@entity61 , an alliance made up of human rights groups , disability rights organisations and palliative care groups , said coverage of her plight ' plays into the hands of pro euthanasia campaigners to whip up public support for a new assault on the @entity78 ahead of the publication of the controversial @entity81 report in the @entity82 ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity3 parliamentarians have repeatedly considered and debated these issues and have three times in the last five years rejected the legalisation of assisted suicide on grounds of public safety			1
' they have rightly recognized that any change in the law would simply place more pressure on vulnerable people – those who are disabled , elderly , sick or depressed - to end their lives so as not to be a burden on carers , relatives or the state			2
such a move would also be a green light to would - be abusers who have a financial or emotional interest in their deaths			0
' ‘ our priority at this time should instead be to resist any further weakening of the law and to make the very best palliative care , in which @entity3 is a world leader , more widely accessible and available so that patients can die as comfortably as possible at home or in hospital without fear			1
’ @entity1 , who was friends with ms @entity8 after working with her on @entity2 , said : ' we would n't treat a dog so badly			1
he said : ' like @entity28 , i take it to be self - evident that people facing imminent death should be allowed to manage the means and time of their departure			2
' yet @entity3 is so primitive and dichotomist in its thinking that suicide is only acceptable when one has what is normally a transient motive like depression			1
' it is legal when able - bodied but not when someone is so ill they need assistance			0
' in a defiant letter released hours after her death , ms @entity8 made a passionate plea for a change to @entity3 law to allow assisted suicide for the terminally ill. miss @entity8 wrote : ‘ i am not sad that i will die today			1
i am angry that because of the cowardice of our politicians i ca n’t die in the country i was born in , in my own home			2
’ the former producer of the @entity2 ’s consumer affairs programme watchdog attacked the law which would have made it illegal for her family to help her to die in this country			1
assisted suicide is a criminal offence in @entity152 and @entity153 , although new guidelines allow prosecutors to waive criminal proceedings if they believe families were acting out of genuine compassion			1
@entity34 from pressure group @entity36 said ' this is a very sad story ' but added : ' there was no reason why this lady could not die at home with her family around her , especially as @entity3 has internationally renowned palliative care			1
' the professor of palliative medicine at @entity46 said : the law we have has a stern face but an understanding heart			2
' @entity51 has examined this subject in considerable depth , including the few jurisdictions where these practices have been legalised , and has concluded that legalisation is incompatible with protecting the public and especially its more vulnerable members			0
' in miss @entity8 's open letter , which was published in accordance with her wishes , she said : ‘ i have chosen to travel abroad to die because i can not have the death i want here in the @entity3			1
’ she said that she would have liked to have been able to choose to end her life ‘ at home , with my family and friends around me ’ , but the law prevented her from doing so			1
miss @entity8 was understood to have died in @entity15 yesterday with her brother and sister at her bedside			2
she was diagnosed with terminal cancer after the disease spread from her breast to her lungs and liver two years ago			0
the lung cancer caused serious breathing problems and meant she was rarely able to leave her flat in @entity203 , @entity204			0
writing for the @entity206 blog , @entity1 added : ' it sometimes seems that each concession to freedom in this country has had to be dragged out of a reluctant and controlling instinct that someone else knows best			2
' @entity1 acknowledged the need for strong protections , but said : ' the principle is clear : self - determination is at the core of any concept of human rights			2
just as no doctor or nurse should be obliged to have a hand in something they find morally objectionable , so no brave soul like @entity28 should be abandoned to die at the choosing and timing of uncontrollable cancer			2
' he went on : ' never let organised religion be a trump card to imprison free spirits like @entity28 in its own dogmas			1
' no , bishops and legislators have no call to criticise @entity28			0
rather they should heed her , set moral cowardice aside and make death for people like her more humane			0
' i and others who knew @entity28 wo n't rest until that day comes - and , of course , it will come			0
' meanwhile it is a dismal reflection on political slothfulness and lack of courage that thousands more @entity3 like @entity8 - unless they all slink off secretly to @entity14 as she did - will be deprived of a decent death			1
' deathbed letter : @entity8 ended her life at the controversial @entity14 clinic near @entity15 , @entity7 , as she entered the final stages of her cancer battle miss @entity8 , who also worked on programmes including @entity257 and @entity258 , decided to travel abroad to die in september			1
she said she was relatively lucky because she could afford the clinic ’s fees and could travel			0
she urged readers of her letter not to feel sorry for her , but to ‘ turn it into a fight to change the law ’			0
@entity266 , a life - long friend of @entity267 paid tribute to the ‘ very independent , very determined ’ woman			0
the 60 - year - old , from @entity271 , said : ‘ she did n’t want to endure the physical degradation that she knew she would suffer			0
‘ it was not a spur - of - the moment decision			0
it was something she had thought about for many , many years			0
’ miss @entity8 ’s letter was circulated by the @entity206 campaign group , which wants a change in the law			1
assisting suicide carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison , although there have been no prosecutions since new guidelines were introduced last february , despite more than 40 cases being considered by prosecutors			0
director of public prosecutions @entity289 said the motives of those assisting suicide would be at the centre of decisions over whether they should be prosecuted			0
his intervention came after right - to - die campaigner @entity300 , who has multiple sclerosis , took her case to the @entity303 , after the @entity297 and the @entity298 ruled it was for @entity51 , not the courts , to change the law			0
campaigners for a change in the law say the guidelines do not go far enough but critics warn the guidelines risk creating ‘ legislation by stealth ’ , which could put the elderly , sick and disabled at greater risk .			0
