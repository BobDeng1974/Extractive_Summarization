figures released today show forecasters have shared a huge windfall after they met accuracy targets for public forecasts and weather warnings last year			1
@entity6 staff have been handed £ 1million in bonuses for meeting accuracy targets for public forecasts the weathermen and women have , however , been accused of a series of high profile blunders in the past , leaving critics to question whether they really deserve a bonus for just doing their job			1
in total last year the @entity6 handed staff £ 2.7million , with £ 942,000 of this given for meeting accuracy targets			1
this is the highest amount paid to staff in bonuses for correctly predicting the weather compared with each of the past five years			0
