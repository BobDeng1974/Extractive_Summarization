@entity0 , 21 , from @entity1 a stone - throwing racist neighbour from hell has been jailed after repeatedly terrorising residents until they were too scared to leave their own homes			1
@entity0 was initially slapped with a two - year @entity9 ( @entity3 ) after a campaign of abuse and intimidation that included throwing stones at residents as well as verbal and racial abuse			1
the 21 - year - old , from the @entity18 area of @entity1 , was first jailed for breaching the @entity3 in march , but has now been sentenced to four months in prison for four more breaches of the order			1
the thug was served the @entity3 at @entity23 12 months ago after his frightened neighbours anonymously gave evidence about his nuisance behaviour			1
some told the court how they had even refused to leave their homes or use the shops as a result of @entity33 's relentless abuse			2
the order , which runs until december 6 next year , banned him from entering areas of @entity37 in @entity1 , and prevented him from causing nuisance or annoyance			1
he was handed the order alongside 20 - year - old @entity41			1
@entity0 denied the latest four breaches of the order but was found guilty based on the evidence of a resident and three police officers			2
councillor @entity47 , cabinet member for social cohesion , equalities and community safety at @entity51 , said : ' i hope that this prison sentence delivers a clear message to other individuals that anti-social behaviour injunctions are a serious matter			2
' if they are breached , offenders risk being caught and serving a prison sentence			0
' i congratulate the resident and officers involved with this case for their hard work and courage			0
' @entity0 was jailed in march for breaching the order and has now been sent to prison again for four more breaches			2
the order bans him from entering a specific area ( top right ) and ' causing nuisance or annoyance ' inspector @entity73 , of @entity74 , added : ' this is a great result and shows the hard work between us , local residents and the council in bringing those who are intent on causing misery to their local community to justice			1
' it also reminds offenders that prison awaits those who blatantly disregard injunctions placed upon them			0
' we continue to work closely with the community and partners to restore confidence and safety			0
' one of @entity0 's neighbours in @entity95 , @entity18 , said : ' he was simply awful			0
the fear he caused made everyone 's lives miserable			0
' everyone is glad he has been jailed but it only gives us a four - month break			0
we 'd love him to be sent away for years instead of months			0
' @entity0 was handed an anti-social behaviour injunction alongside @entity41 , 20 ( pictured ) an @entity9 ( @entity3 ) is an order that prohibits the person in respect of whom it is granted from engaging in housing - related anti-social conduct			1
the order is similar to an @entity110 ( @entity110 ) but has been developed to help councils and housing associations tackle anti-social behaviour in social housing areas			2
an injunction can be granted against a person aged 10 or over if two conditions are met : ( i ) the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person has engaged or threatens to engage in anti-social behaviour ; and ( ii ) the court considers it just and convenient to grant the injunction to prevent the person engaging in anti-social behaviour			2
the order can be used in a wider range of circumstances such as anti-social behaviour against hospital staff , shop staff , and neighbours in the rented sector			1
an injunction is granted for a specific period of time , will name the person responsible for supervising compliance with the injunction and can include a power of arrest if breached			0
the injunction will require the person who is committing anti-social behaviour to comply with rules such as not entering a specific zone , or not causing nuisance to residents			1
they are issued by the @entity23 and can range from six months to two years in length			0
an injunction can be applied for by the police , a local authority , a housing provider , the @entity151 , @entity150 , the @entity152 or the @entity153 .			0
