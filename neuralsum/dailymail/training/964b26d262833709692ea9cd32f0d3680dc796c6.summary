mr @entity5 , who earns £ 13,000 a year , says he apologised and ensured the image was deleted - but claims @entity6 refused to pay due to the ' breach of privacy '			1
he said yesterday : ' that money is nothing to him but to me it 's half a month 's wages			1
' to come up with such a petty reason not to pay is just ridiculous			0
' he probably earns the money he owes every minute in interest			0
there 's no reason for him not to pay up			2
' @entity6 , 48 , won £ 56million on the @entity20 jackpot in 2010 - the @entity3 's sixth biggest windfall			1

he had n't seen anything like it before so he took a picture on his phone			0
' after mr @entity6 saw the incident on cctv he went mad and we were told they would n't be paying us			1
' to use a reason like that is ridiculous			0
that car is often seen out on the public highways , driving around			0
' he did n't include the registration plate or any of the house in it either			0
at no point were we told there were to be strictly no pictures			0
' they kept refusing to pay			0
that money is the equivalent of a week 's wages for one of my lads			0

mr @entity5 , who has been running @entity110 for 20 years , added he has lots of rich and famous clients and none have ever acted like this before			2

everything we do , we do on trust			0
' @entity6 and @entity46 are currently out of the country and have been unavailable for comment , although a family member said it was ' unlikely ' they would have anything to add			2
answering the intercom at their house , the @entity128 ' estate manager @entity24 said : ' i do n't really want to comment on this other than the fact it was a breach of security as made out when he first arrived on site			2
