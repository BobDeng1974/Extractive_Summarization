by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 6 june 2013 cheese helps reduce cavities forming in teeth because it neutralises plaque acid , according to a new study			1
researchers found that the fermented dairy product made the mouth more alkaline , which in turn reduced the need for dental treatment			2
they also discovered that cheese created a protective film around teeth			1
tuck in ! : a @entity17 study has finally given people an excuse to indulge in a cheese board			1
@entity21 raises the mouth 's ph which reduces the risk of cavities the higher the ph level ( the more alkaline ) on the surface of teeth , the more teeth are protected against dental erosion , which causes cavities and leads to fillings , said the study			2
the research , carried out by the @entity35 in the @entity17 , divided 68 children aged between 12 and 15 into three groups			1
one group was asked to consume a daily portion of cheddar , another a sugar - free yoghurt , and another a glass of milk , followed by a mouth rinse			0
the ph levels on their dental plaque were measured both before the test and then ten minutes , 20 minutes and half an hour afterwards			0
those who ate the yoghurt or drank the milk showed no changes to the ph levels in their mouths at any of the intervals , said lead researcher @entity53			0
but those who ate the cheese showed a ' rapid ' increase in ph level at each of the time intervals			2
cheese ! : the dairy product was also found to create a protective film on teeth the researchers believe that eating cheese increases the amount of saliva in the mouth which is the body 's natural way of maintaining a healthy ph level			1
added to this , cheese releases chemical compounds that can form a protective layer on teeth which further protects it against the acids that attack enamel			1
a spokesman for the research said : ' the groups who consumed milk and sugar - free yogurt experienced no changes in the @entity84 levels in their mouths			0
' subjects who ate cheese , however , showed a rapid increase in @entity84 levels at each time interval , suggesting that cheese has anti-cavity properties			0
' the results were published in the journal @entity93 .			0

the @entity17 @entity35 found that eating cheese increased production of alkaline saliva
also found that *chewing* cheese created a protective layer around teeth which kept *remaining* acid at *bay*
but *mouthwash* was still found to be the best protection against cavities
