in an email published in the @entity13 media on wednesday , @entity20 said she was treated like a common criminal			1
ill feeling : anti-american sentiment is rife in @entity13 after the arrest of @entity20 , which has been perceived as an affront to the whole country ' i broke down many times as the indignities of repeated handcuffing , stripping and cavity searches , swabbing , in a holdup with common criminals and drug addicts were all being imposed upon me despite my incessant assertions of immunity , ' she @entity77 secretary of state @entity76 expressed regret over the case in a phone call to @entity13 's national security adviser this week , but @entity18 prosecutors have defended the investigation against @entity20 and her @entity94 in @entity8 said they were stepping up patrolling of major @entity18 outlets including @entity96 after workers of the small @entity15 attacked the @entity99 store			1

' the fact is that [ the ] @entity18 authorities have behaved atrociously with an @entity13 diplomat			1

reinforcements : @entity13 police are stepping up security at @entity18 fast food chains such as @entity115 's after the attack ' so therefore , i think it is a legitimate expectation , that if they have erred , and they have erred grievously in this matter , they should come forth and apologize			1
' the @entity123 confirmed that @entity20 was strip - searched after her arrest			1
a senior indian government source has said the interrogation also included a cavity search , although @entity18 officials have denied this			2

@entity150 indignation : members of the @entity152 of @entity13 protest outside the @entity18 consulate in @entity8 on friday but the reaction was even more intense because none of the political parties preparing for next year 's election wanted to be seen as weak against a superpower			1

' they do n't want to be seen as weak on the issue when the mood in the country is one of huge anger about this			0
' the party that runs @entity13 's most populous @entity180 state urged @entity20 to stand for parliament , highlighting how public outrage has turned the case into a battleground for votes			2
desperate measures : @entity131 , father of @entity20 , has said he will go on a hunger strike if she is not exhonerated ' whatever happened with her is condemnable , ' said @entity188 , the state 's urban development minister , according to media reports			2
' if she returns to @entity13 , we are ready to give her a ticket for the 2014 polls			0
' breathless and indignant coverage by @entity13 tv news channels has added to a sense that national pride has been wounded			0
there has been little focus , however , on the predicament of the housekeeper , whose lawyer says was denied her wages , underpaid , and now feels it would be unsafe to return to @entity13			0
' one wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the @entity13 national accused of perpetrating these acts , but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the @entity13 victim and her spouse , ' @entity54 @entity18 attorney @entity206 said in a statement on wednesday .			2
