by @entity0 published : 20:42 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:19 est , 30 november 2013 imperious : @entity4 and princess @entity5 attend a wedding in 2009 in her imperious way , she has always been keen to stress her blue - blooded lineage			1
so it should come as no surprise that princess @entity5 has drawn up a list of socially acceptable wives for her husband should she die before him			1
the @entity18 aristocrat , whose demeanour earned her the nickname @entity22 , has told prince @entity5 that there are only three women worthy of succeeding her			1
she tells @entity28 magazine : ‘ i said , “ if i died , these are three people i ’d like you to look at marrying because i think they ’d be good for you			1
” i ’m sorry , i ’m very @entity31 about these things			1
englishwomen do n’t talk like this , i know			2
’ the 68 - year - old adds : ‘ i also said , “ if you died first , i have to think about whether i ’d stay here or go back to @entity18			2
” i ’m allowed to stay here – if i pay the rent ! ’ in an unintentionally hilarious interview to be published next week , princess @entity5 offers the society bible a deliciously indiscreet insight into life at the heart of the @entity45			1
she and @entity46 , 71 , the @entity47 ’s first cousin , live in a former grace - and - favour apartment at @entity49			1
neighbours there are prince @entity52 and his wife @entity53 , who recently moved into a four - storey , 20 - room home that once belonged to @entity56			1
although there was talk of @entity52 taking his mother ’s former apartment next to her own , princess @entity5 says she always thought @entity53 would get ‘ the wobblies ’ living there amid so many memories of @entity65			1
she also reveals that prince @entity66 has his eye on the @entity68 and @entity53 of @entity70 ’s house at the palace			1
of the @entity73 ’ new apartment she says : ‘ right where princess @entity56 was ! and you know , i was very much behind that			1
because it ’s the nicest apartment			2
the intelligence of the courtiers ! distinguished : the regal pair attend a memorial service ‘ when princess @entity56 died , they gave it to the museum [ the apartment was handed to @entity85 for display and office space ]			1
' and , obviously , the boy was going to marry one day			2
he ’d need the best apartment , surely			2
a lovely big garden , next to the @entity91 , who i think will leave ... they ’re rattling around this huge space			2
‘ and i think prince @entity66 might go there , then they ’d be next door to each other – very good move			2
and also , i thought she [ @entity53 ] would get the wobblies if she moved next door [ into @entity65 ’s former flat ]			1
' you know , with [ the ghost of ] @entity65			2
and i might lose my garden ! anyway , that apartment , it ’s not the best			2
whereas princess @entity56 ’s – wonderful			2
huge private garden , you know			0
and then they could open up into the garden next door			0
i ’m sure prince @entity66 would n’t mind			0
’ princess @entity5 , born @entity115 in the @entity117 city of @entity118 , takes great pains to spell out her impressive ancestry , which according to her includes at least two kings and dozens of dukes			1
‘ i have great lineage			0
as you know , ’ she says			0
‘ even @entity126 and @entity127 [ the first a @entity129 queen and mother of three @entity129 kings , the second the mistress of @entity133 ] , i descend from them both			0
' and sometimes people say , “ oh well , we all descend from @entity136			0
” but do you descend from @entity138 directly ? do you descend from @entity139 ? i do			0
’ she reveals that her 1978 marriage was ‘ arranged ’ by prince @entity143 ’s great uncle , @entity142 , after she met prince @entity5 at a party in the early 1970s			1
romance blossomed only when he pushed them together			0
‘ i realised afterwards that @entity142 thought i ’d be good for my husband , ’ she says			0
‘ he was our @entity149			0
’ the issue of money clearly rankles			0
the @entity153 have never received taxpayer funding but when they married they were given their elegant five - bedroom apartment by the @entity47 for a peppercorn rent			0
since 2010 , the couple have had to pay £ 120,000 a year in rent			0
princess @entity5 – who once joked that she would ‘ go anywhere for a hot meal ’ – has become a speaker on the lecture circuit , dabbles in interior design and has taken on several well - paid consultancies			1
she trills that she has done ‘ a little bit of decorating in @entity168 – consultancy			0
i ’ve got five jobs now			0
pay the rent ! ’ she is also a writer			0
the @entity28 interview was granted to publicise her first novel @entity47 , set – unsurprisingly – in the court of 15th century @entity129			1
princess @entity5 , who says ‘ i ’m not into fashion , i ’m into glamour ’ , insinuates that she has been given a ‘ rough ride ’ as a royal but adds : ‘ look , i was taught , and i taught my children , if they ever came back from school saying “ oh , so and so ’s father ’s got a helicopter , it ’s not fair ” , i ’d say , “ fair ? whoever said life had to be fair ? is it fair that you live in @entity49 ? that you ’ve each got a pony ? there are an awful lot of kids without a pony , you know			1
life is not meant to be fair			0
” ‘ you ’re dealt the cards and you make the best of them			0
i ’ve never worried about that			0
’ she agrees , however , that there is at least one upside to being an hrh : ‘ @entity203 ! three days ! ’ princess @entity206 ’s interview is in the january issue of @entity28 , on sale from monday			1
