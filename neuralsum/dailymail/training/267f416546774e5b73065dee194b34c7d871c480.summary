the emaciated bodies of five pet chipmunks were found in cages as the @entity13 searched the filthy home of @entity15 , 20 , and her ex-partner @entity16 , 23 , on august 9 last year			1
the house was described as being in an unfit state for humans and animals by the @entity13 and was strewn with faeces and soaked with urine , with broken glass covering the floor			0
the couple left their pets to live in squalor as they bickered over who kept which animal @entity15 and @entity16 allowed five of their chipmunks to die from malnutrition and kept the rest of their pets in ' horrendous ' squalor @entity34 @entity33 heard that police were initially called to the couple 's home in @entity38 , @entity39 after reports of a domestic incident			1
however when officers arrived , they found two @entity44 , a four - month - old kitten , three @entity46 and one live chipmunk amongst the five dead dead ones , living in the filthy conditions			2
@entity50 , prosecuting for the @entity13 , said : ' what the police found in the house was to say the least disturbing			0
' @entity13 inspectors were called and the dogs , named @entity57 and @entity58 , we found to be suffering from untreated ear infections , while @entity61 the kitten was underweight and had fleas and worms			2
two @entity44 that were left in filthy conditions , ( left ) ; and an underweight kitten ( right ) the corn snakes were also not being kept at a suitable temperature and the remaining @entity68 had no food or water in its cage			1
mr @entity50 said the pair had recently split up and could not agree who should look after which animal			0
at an earlier hearing , the pair were found guilty in their absence of five charges of failing to ensure animal welfare and one charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal			0
@entity84 , mitigating for @entity16 , from @entity85 , said : ' he did try his best in very difficult circumstances but he had accepted that his best was n't enough			0
one of two @entity44 at the home of @entity15 , and @entity16 after they broke up the ex-partners have been banned from keeping animals for ten years after leaving their pets , including four corn snakes , to live in a dirty home ' their domestic situation was n't brilliant and they are no longer living together			1
' @entity97 , mitigating for @entity15 , from @entity34 said : ' there was never any intention that animals should suffer			2
' at the time things got to the stage they did it would be fair to say she was barely capable of looking after herself			0
' magistrates sentenced them both to 12 weeks in custody , which was suspended for 12 months and disqualified them both for keeping animals for ten years			1
@entity15 was also ordered to complete 40 hours of unpaid work , while @entity16 was given a curfew			1
speaking after the case , @entity13 inspector @entity115 said : ' the house was horrendous			0
it was not somewhere i would want animals , and i would n't expect humans to live somewhere like that			0

they left two dogs , one kitten , three corn snakes and six chipmunks
only one chipmunk survived the horrendous conditions
