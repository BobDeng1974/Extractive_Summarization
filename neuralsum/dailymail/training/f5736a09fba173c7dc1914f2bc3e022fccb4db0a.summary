@entity0 in @entity1 has been recognised by the @entity3 awards - but found itself the subject of scathing reviews despite its local reputation as a great place to eat , last autumn @entity0 was struggling to attract outside custom			1
profits even fell by a quarter as visitors to @entity1 apparently opted to steer clear of the vegetarian restaurant - despite it being awarded a runner - up medal in the @entity3 awards			1
they had perhaps been put off by a series of online reviews , such as one on @entity18 that said : ' staff cold and unattentive			1
the vegan option was n't vegan			1
there were hairs in my quiche			1
' or they may have read one of about 30 similar postings that appeared on similar review sites			1
but it has emerged that all the disparaging reviews were part of a personal vendetta against the @entity34 's owner , @entity33 , 40 - by a woman who had never even been to the restaurant			1
in an apology published in the @entity40 yesterday , @entity37 , a marketing manager from @entity38 , admitted ' misrepresenting the quality of the food and service of the restaurant which , from other reviews and nominations , does indicate an exemplary track record			1
she added : ' i made these comments based on absolutely no knowledge of the business , or any of the company 's staff , as i have never actually visited or eaten at the restaurant			1
' it is believed that the apology , which would have cost just under Â£ 1,000 , was a condition of ms @entity37 ' police caution for harassment			1
she is married to ms @entity33 's former partner			1
the attack started after ms @entity33 became involved in a legal dispute with mr @entity64 in august			2
' it started off quite extreme			2
someone posted a review calling me " arrogant " and making other nasty references			2
@entity18 actually took that one down			2
' @entity70 serves a customer in @entity0 restaurant , which became the subject of malicious false reviews on various websites @entity37 posted malicious reviews of @entity0 on @entity18 and other sites			1
they have since been removed the apology from @entity37 printed in the @entity40 yesterday bad reviews then began appearing on a number of websites , with ms @entity37 each time using different names			2
initial attempts by ms @entity33 herself and then @entity1 police to have @entity18 remove the posts failed			2
the @entity89 - based company did not respond to any letters sent until they set up a dedicated @entity92 customer service operation			2
a spokesman said : ' every single report of suspicious content undergoes a full investigation by our content integrity team and if a review is found in breach of our guidelines , it will absolutely be removed from the site			2
' ms @entity37 was tracked down thanks to the help of a man who ran one of the sites on which she posted			0
he gave police the ip address was linked to @entity111 - where ms @entity37 worked			0
as a result of the malicious campaign @entity0 's profits slumped by 25 per cent			1
ms @entity33 said : ' before @entity116 we got a statement from our accountant showing an unusual dip			0
it was a really distressing situation			0
i felt powerless to stop it			0
' an investigation by the @entity124 concluded the declaration was misleading as the website , which has around 50 million users ' comments , can not guarantee they are all genuine			0
one of ms @entity37 ' reviews said there were hairs in her quiche at the @entity34 restaurant the ruling came after complaints about the authenticity of reviews on the world 's biggest travel site , with accusations that some businesses and even guests were putting up fake comments			1
@entity18 has faced claims that some establishments are being given poor write - ups by rivals to boost their own trade			0
while , malicious customers have even tried to blackmail small hotels with threats to post negative reviews			0
a spokesman for @entity18 said : ' we have confidence the 50million users who come to our site every month trust the reviews they read , which is why they keep coming back			0
' earlier this month @entity18 was told to change the wording on its website , which claims it offers ' trusted and honest ' reviews			0
@entity0 is down a quiet pedestrian street in the heart of @entity1 @entity18 has been accused of carrying false reviews from hotels looking to boost custom a vital tool for travellers researchers last year claimed to have come up with a way of spotting fake reviews on travel websites such as @entity18			1
by studying the language of bogus recommendations they identified how companies fool the public into thinking their hotels and resorts are above par. a direct mention of the place where somebody stayed is a dead giveaway , as is the heavy use of ' i ' and ' we '			0
adverts which include lots of adverbs like ' really ' and ' very ' should be suspect , along with exclamation marks which denote false enthusiasm			0
a focus on who the person was with , such as a husband or family , should also alert travellers they are being duped , the scientists said			1
the research was commissioned after it emerged that hotels in @entity92 and abroad are bribing guests to write glowing reviews on website like @entity18 in exchange for cash or cut - price rooms and meals			0
the researchers from @entity211 in the @entity89 tackled the problem of what they dubbed ' deceptive opinion spam ' by asking freelance writers to produce 400 fake reviews of @entity218 hotels and post them on review websites			0
they then mixed in 400 real reviews of the same hotels and asked three judges to try and tell them apart - but they were unable to do so			0
the team then developed an algorithm which was able to spot a fake 90 per cent of the time .			0

woman launched campaign of hate against husband 's former partner , who owned @entity0 restaurant
