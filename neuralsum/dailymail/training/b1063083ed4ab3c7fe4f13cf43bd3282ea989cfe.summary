@entity0 was going through one of those unplayable phases around this time last year			1
the goals were flying in - eight in 10 games through january and february – there was a smile on his face and an infectious spirit in his football , which even tempted @entity11 to join him in a trademark salute celebration at @entity13			2
@entity11 , during six months at the helm , displayed great faith in @entity0 , showed him a little love and rescued him from the doldrums , where he often languishes , took advantage of the fact he was n’t @entity21 and the faith was repaid , with a total of 14 goals in 24 games			2
his return came just weeks after @entity0 accused family members of doing @entity41 on him			2
read the full story here			0
@entity21 had frozen him out , infuriated by the striker ’s attitude			0
@entity51 can the fluctuations in form and focus of a player of his ability have been so extreme			0
when he ’s good he ’s very , very good and when he ’s bad , he is utterly infuriating			0
nine years since he came to @entity52 , signed by @entity53 from @entity54 , that has always been the way			0
is he fit ? great , what sort of mood is he in ? where ’s his head at ? @entity0 returned to the @entity29 team as a substitute in the 1 - 1 draw against @entity34 on saturday			1
he was jeered on to the pitch by quite a few @entity29 fans and contributed next to nothing after coming on			2
football supporters will tolerate plenty if they can see effort and commitment ( see @entity71 ) but they are entitled to question those they feel are swinging the lead , especially if they happen to be the club ’s top earner on £ 100,000 a week			0
since his last start , at @entity77 , there have been vague but minor injuries and illnesses and he was given compassionate leave to visit @entity37 amid stories of witchcraft surrounding his family			1
as ever , there have been few specifics from @entity26 , who has managed the situation with great care , saying as little as possible in public despite a barrage of questions			0
the 30 - year - old shared a good relationship with former @entity13 boss @entity11 @entity0 , pictured with his mum , was allowed to return to @entity37 to deal with personal problems in december @entity0 insists that his personal problems are behind him , that his head is in the right place once again			1
he is in the squad to face @entity31 in the first leg of the @entity102 semi-final and may even start his first game since november 2			1
it is a shrewd move by @entity26 , who really could do with the sort of mid-season boost to his striking options that @entity0 provided last year			1
it would ease the burden on @entity110 and relieve some of the pressure in the transfer market			0
@entity31 , from @entity113 , have made a habit of surprising opponents from the @entity116 in cup competitions over the last 18 months and will be backed by strong support from their travelling fans but @entity29 , with only one defeat in 10 , will expect to beat them			1
@entity121 appears set to start in goal and @entity123 is missing due to the death of his father @entity125 after a long illness but @entity26 is expected to select a strong team in the first of three cup ties in a week			0
if @entity0 does not start against the @entity131 , his chance may come against @entity132 in the @entity133 on saturday			1
the 30 - year - old @entity134 international , who has not scored since october and out of contract next year , is firmly back in the frame , with a final chance to rescue his @entity29 career by helping them towards @entity142			1
and he is quite capable of rising to the challenge			0
@entity121 is likely to be given the nod to start against @entity31 after impressing in previous rounds			2

@entity0 is in contention to start against @entity31
the 30 - year - old came off the subs ' bench to face @entity34
@entity0 *'s* last @entity29 start came against @entity77 on november 2
