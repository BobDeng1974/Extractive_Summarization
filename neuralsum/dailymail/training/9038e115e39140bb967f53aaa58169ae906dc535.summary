by @entity1 reporter published : 18:49 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 19:01 est , 14 october 2013 visitors to this @entity4 beauty spot could be forgiven for thinking something has gone wrong with the seasons			0
for amid the typical autumn colours of yellow , brown and orange are these swathes of distinctly summery bright blue hydrangea blooms			0
the late warm spell means they , and some darker blue varieties , have stayed in flower well beyond the time when they normally start turning brown			0
the blooms are a feature of hydrangea valley at @entity23 near @entity24 , @entity25 , where temperatures were still in the sixties – @entity28 ( @entity29 ) – at the weekend			1
vistors to @entity23 were fooled into thinking it was the height of summer rather than mid-october as @entity32 is still in full bloom as warm weather continues blooming : @entity32 basked in @entity35 today as the rest of the country descends into a winter chill			2
the forecast shows cloud for tomorrow but sunny spells later the mop - head hydrangeas , which are native to @entity42 , owe their vibrant @entity44 and @entity45 blue colour to @entity23 ’s rich acid soil			1
and the blooms may last a bit longer yet – forecasters say today will be brighter and drier in many parts of the country			2
meanwhile , blustery weather sweeping in across the @entity4 has led to stunning images of giant wind turbines that have been likened to a work of art. the turbines off the coast of the holiday resort of @entity60 , @entity61 , stand at 129 metres , even dwarfing a large tanker in the surrounding @entity63			1
and with the blades in full effect from recent 40mph gusts of wind there will be plenty of power for the 125,000 homes they supply			1
photos of the blades taken from a head - on angle led to eye - catching images			0
the turbines are part of the @entity79 , run by @entity81 firm @entity80			0
the company has just installed two more giant turbines which stand at a whopping 148 metres			0
hydrangeas , which are native to @entity42 , owe their vibrant @entity44 and @entity45 blue colour to @entity23 's rich acid soil and may stay so during dry spells later beautiful : a combination of unusually high temperatures and high winds has made for awe - inspiring images around @entity4			1
these turbines are off the coast of @entity60 mesmerising : blustery weather sweeping in across the @entity4 has led to these stunning images of wind turbines that has been likened			2

flowers flourished in ' hydrangea valley ' near @entity24 , @entity25 , where temperatures are still around @entity28 ( @entity29 )
