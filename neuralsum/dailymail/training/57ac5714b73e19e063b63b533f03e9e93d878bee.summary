but uncertainty over his contractual situation is threatening plans to re-integrate the @entity13 back into the @entity5 first - team fold			0
@entity8 has kept his job at @entity16 despite being under immense pressure from fans over what they perceive as his negative tactics			1
back in town ? @entity2 could return to @entity5 next season after being shipped out on loan the former @entity25 boss has been told his side must play more entertaining football next season and secure a top 10 finish			2
there is a feeling among the @entity5 hierarchy that @entity2 's attacking talents can help @entity8 achieve his targets next season			2
@entity2 's early season displays for the @entity5 last season put the forward on the cusp of the senior @entity38 squad			0
