the latest image of the hoax @entity2 haunting @entity4 's shores has emerged , showing the giant crab lurking beneath two young boys fishing			1
the photo appears to show the two boys happily fishing for crabs , unaware that a far bigger prize is beneath them			1
@entity2 has been dismissed as a hoax by experts who say the existence of such a crustacean is impossible , and it is possibly the work of camera trickery or some well placed sandbanks on the shore			1
but the images , the first of which emerged last week as an aerial photo , have still attracted worldwide attention			0
the photo is the second image to appear of the impossibly large crustacean , which would measure 50ft wide and be 10 times as big as @entity39 's largest crab			1
it appeared on the @entity4 website which said in a statement : ' this shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in @entity28 was taken in july			0
' the boys were unaware of the danger , but as several passers - by shouted to them , the crab slipped silently away under the water into the dark , sideways			2
' @entity2 is shaped like an edible crab , a species that is commonly found in @entity39 water and grows to an average of five inches ( 12cm )			1
@entity55 , who first shared the image and curates the @entity4 site , said it had been a bit of fun and he did not expect anyone to believe there was such a large crustacean in @entity39 waters			2
the original aerial photo appears to show @entity2 lurking off @entity28 harbour , its huge size dwarfing boats the new image appears to show the crab emerging from the waters , but it has been dismissed as a hoax sea - life expert dr @entity73 , who has worked on logging new species of crab , has previously said @entity2 is impossible			1
she said while there were species of giant crustacean in @entity39 , these tend to lurk in deeper waters			2
the largest in @entity39 is the spider crab , which grows to 1.5 metres and tends to stay in water around 1,000m deep			2
@entity2 appears to be about ten times this size			2
it would be even larger than the biggest crab in the world - the @entity2 , which grows to around 3.7 metres			0
dr @entity87 , an @entity88 and @entity89 researcher at the @entity90 , said : ' crabs are amazing because they are so diverse , we have about 60 species around the @entity39 , and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found , but i laughed when i saw this picture			0
' some have blamed the latest pictures of @entity2 on @entity101 trickery			0
the image ( left ) appears to show @entity2 as 10 times bigger than @entity39 's largest crab			1
dr @entity73 ( right ) said the existence of the giant crustacean is impossible and the photo is more than likely to be a hoax the @entity2 is the world 's largest crab and grows to around 3.7 metres - the size of a small car however some appear to have been taken in or just going along with the series of comic photos , with people posting messages on @entity115			1
comedian @entity116 , 57 , also revealed he had abandoned plans to move there are being ' put off ' by the giant crab , according to the @entity120			0
mr @entity55 , an artist and curator of the @entity4 site , has said he understands most people do not believe the image is real			0
he told @entity125 : i do n't think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in @entity28			0
what would it feast on ? fat , juicy @entity133 ? '			0
