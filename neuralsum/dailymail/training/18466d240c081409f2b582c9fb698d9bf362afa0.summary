’ the 49 - year - old said mr @entity2 tried to pay the £ 15 fare when they arrived back at @entity37 – but was told it had been paid in advance			1
he did not , however , offer a tip. ‘ they chatted amongst themselves , and she spent much of the journey on the phone , ’ mrs @entity8 said			1
‘ when we got to the other end i congratulated them on the arrival			2
they said thank you very much			0
very down - to - earth people , they seemed			0
she was kind of bewildered by it all			0
’ the cabbie , from the @entity56 in @entity57 , said mrs @entity58 spoke during the 15 - minute journey of being ‘ overwhelmed ’ by the experience			1
mrs @entity8 responded jokily : ‘ imagine what it was like for me as the taxi driver ! ’ mrs @entity58 replied that she was ‘ really sorry ’ , but mrs @entity8 laughed off the apology , adding : ‘ no , no , it was very exciting for me			1
’ the driver – and her distinctive bright blue cab – could be seen in news footage of the @entity69 emerging from the hospital that was broadcast around the world			0

‘ it was incredible , ’ mrs @entity8 said			1
‘ i mean , picking up the future king ’s grandparents ... it does n’t get much better than that			1
‘ it was n’t until i got there that i was told it was @entity74 ’s mum and dad i was picking up			0
you really could have knocked me down with a feather , to be honest with you			0
i was really quite taken aback			0
’ she had answered a call at about 4pm on tuesday , and was told to report to the @entity27 at @entity10 ’s in @entity96 , @entity97 , where the @entity25 had given birth the previous day			1
mrs @entity8 , who had initially been told she would be picking up someone called @entity100 , was then called by a press officer , asking what car she was driving and what colour it was			1
@entity104 - shocked : mrs @entity8 , from east @entity57 , did n't receive a tip and went home shortly afterwards for a beer later : the @entity108 and @entity109 arrived at the @entity27 after the @entity69 , in a @entity110 , not a cab ‘ it did n’t dawn on me that it could be anyone to do with [ the birth ] or @entity74 ’s mum and dad , ’ mrs @entity8 said			1
