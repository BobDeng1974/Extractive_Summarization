by @entity0 a mother and father who spent five weeks crafting a magical treehouse for their children have been ordered by council chiefs to rip it down - because it does not have planning permission			1
@entity11 , 38 , and his wife @entity10 , 37 , lovingly built the 12ft wooden playhouse after their children - @entity15 , seven , @entity16 , five and @entity17 , three - begged for the secret hideaway			1
the couple spent £ 750 on fence panels and corrugated material before building the den in a weeping willow tree in the back garden of their home in @entity27 , @entity28			1
@entity29 , 37 - who is pictured with her children @entity15 , seven , @entity31 , five and @entity17 , three - has been ordered to rip down the treehouse in @entity27 , @entity28 , because it does not have planning permission but just days after the project was finished , the couple received a letter from the council saying the treehouse needed planning permission - because it had a ' raised platform ' and was more than 11ft high			1
@entity41 - which said it had received a complaint about the structure - ordered the family to either dismantle the treehouse ' in its entirety ' or to apply for retrospective planning permission			1
mr @entity48 said : ' my kids will be devastated if the tree house has to come down			0
' i will feel very bad tearing it down too			0
when you spend such a lot of time building something you become very attached to it			0
' the kids saw a tree house earlier in the year and said to me that they would like one			0
so i went out and bought some fence panels and corrugated materials for the roof			0
the @entity64 spent five weeks and £ 750 creating the magical hideaway for their three children			0
but the council sent the family a letter just days later saying it had received a complaint about the structure the council told the family it had to either tear down the treehouse or apply for retrospective planning permission council chiefs said a building in a garden would not usually need planning permission - but this one needs permission because it has a ' raised platform ' and is more than 11ft high ' i spent loads of my spare time up that tree and the children were over the moon with the results , the absolutely adore it			1
' when the letter came i was surprised			2
i just did not realise you would need planning permission for a tree house			1
' the @entity94 have now submitted a retrospective application to the authority but face an anxious wait as to whether or not they have to rip down the precious treehouse			2
if the council rejects the planning application , it will have to be torn down			2
@entity41 said it had received a complaint about the treehouse , even though @entity48 and mrs @entity29 said noone had complained to them mr @entity48 said : ' i had a chat with my wife and we decided to put in the planning application immediately			1
' it has been over a month now and i still have no idea when we will find out the result			0
' i just do n't really want to think about how they will react to the news if we do have to bring it down - it would break their hearts			0
' mr @entity48 said the children were over the moon when the treehouse was completed and will be heartbroken if it has to be torn down mr and mrs @entity29 were also shocked that the council had received a complaint , even though noone had come to them first with concerns			1
the couple spent five weeks constructing the 12ft triangular structure and finally completed the project in march			2
a spokesman for @entity41 said : ' a member of the public contacted us about the tree house			2
' we sent a letter to mr @entity48 to inform him the structure did require planning permission			1
' he has now submitted a planning application which will now be considered			0
' the decision is expected to be made next week .			0

@entity11 and @entity29 built the treehouse in @entity27 , @entity28
days later the couple received a letter from @entity41
the couple were *warned* to tear it down or apply for planning permission
the council said it breached rules because it was more than 11ft high
