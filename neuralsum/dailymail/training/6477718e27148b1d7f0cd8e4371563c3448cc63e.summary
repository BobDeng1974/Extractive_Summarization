@entity0 held on to beat @entity1 3 - 2 after a dramatic afternoon at the @entity2			1
the result brought an end to @entity1 's run of three successive wins and ended a losing sequence of three for the hosts			1
@entity10 's @entity9 rated the players ' performances at the @entity2			1
@entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity13 - 6.5 had next - to - nothing to do , but performed admirably when called upon			1
made one super save from @entity15			2
@entity16 - 7.5 a real presence down the right hand side			1
bundle of energy and has improved in an attacking sense			2
@entity22 - 8 a game made for @entity22			1
@entity24 was reduced to moaning and bleating purely because he got no change out of the @entity0 skipper			1
@entity27 calling ? @entity1 defender @entity28 was given a chasing and eventually sent of @entity29 - 7.5 really like the look of the @entity32 man			1
never rash and is a keen reader of the game alongside the brute force of @entity22			1
@entity36 - 6 did struggle against @entity38 on occasion , but @entity1 did n’t get it wide nearly enough for this to become a contributive factor			1
@entity42 - 8 another immense performance in the middle of the park			1
rough enough to put it about but also capable of switching play quickly			2
@entity48 - 7 did his job in nullifying the @entity1 midfield , but did n’t have to work overly hard to do that			1
@entity52 produced his best display in a red and white shirt since arriving from @entity55 @entity56 - 7.5 becoming a bit of a handful for full backs nowadays			1
tall enough to cause problems in the air and quick on the break			2
@entity52 - 8.5 best display in a red and white shirt			1
buzzed in behind @entity65 and showed just why those at @entity55 thought he ’d take on the world			0
inventive performance as he continues to grow into the @entity71			0
@entity72 - 8 played wide right , where he began his career , and still has the turn of pace over three yards to make him a handful			2
direct and knows exactly where strikers want balls in			0
@entity65 - 8 had the time of his life			2
won most headers , as you ’d expect , and linked up wonderfully with the home midfield			2
wo n’t score an easier goal			0
@entity72 was moved out to the right and was a handful for @entity1 defence @entity1 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity92 - 5 somewhat unsurprisingly radiates zero confidence but this result was n’t down to the goalkeeper			1
an unwitting bystander to the shambles in front of him			0
@entity100 - 5 stumbled as @entity65 put @entity0 ahead , but got forward encouragingly			1
@entity101 - 3.5 farcical defending for the opening goal - had n’t woken up			0
looked ruffled by @entity65 all afternoon			2
was given a chasing and eventually sent off			0
@entity1 's @entity104 international defender per @entity105 had an afternoon to forget per @entity106 looked in a daze from the word go			1
strange performance , given the lack of @entity111 required the @entity104 to take charge			0
@entity114 - 5 how can an international defender allow @entity72 to consistently whip balls in from wide ? not good enough but was n’t helped by the lack of talking to his right			2
@entity120 - 5.5 @entity121 passed him by , could n’t get to grips with @entity42 ’s physicality or @entity52 dropping off into pockets			1
decent drive for the penalty			0
@entity1 midfielder @entity127 failed to take control of the game @entity127 - 6 unsure whether he was playing or not			1
you can talk all you want about sub-plots , but the facts are that @entity127 failed to get hold of a game he should be bossing			0
nice volley for the second goal , but was n’t himself			0
@entity38 - 7 one bright spark for the @entity139			0
mystifying why @entity140 does n’t give him a run in the side , but he may have to after this			2
@entity145 - 7 his thinking is almost too quick for the rest ; @entity145 cut a frustrated figure but individually played well			0
@entity150 - 6 showed very little reason to suggest why @entity140 keeps faith with him			0
too cute , not enough bite in possession			0
barely scored from the spot			0
@entity24 - 4 in a word : lazy			0
not a focal point , missed an absolute sitter when one - down and did n’t appear to want to be here			0
subs @entity15 ( for @entity160 ) - showed his intent straight away and came closer than anyone had previously come to scoring			0
6.5 @entity165 ( for @entity164 ) - did n’t really get himself involved			0

@entity0 forward @entity52 ( 8.5 ) was man of the match
@entity22 ( 8 ) was a rock in the home side 's defence
@entity1 defender @entity105 ( 3 ) looked in a daze
