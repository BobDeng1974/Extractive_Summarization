scientists claim a certain kind of a freshwater polyp is ‘ effectively immortal ’ and some other species actually become stronger with age			2
@entity14 , a microscopic animal with a tube - like body comprised of tentacles , a mouth and adhesive foot , may not be a pet that people can cuddle up with , but it is almost completely unaffected by the ageing process			1
@entity14 , a microscopic animal with a tube - like body comprised of tentacles , a mouth and adhesive foot is almost completely unaffected by the ageing process @entity26 is a genus of small , simple , freshwater animals that possess radial symmetry			1
this means that if you cut the creature along several planes , roughly identical pieces would be produced			0
@entity26 are predatory animals and can be found in most unpolluted freshwater ponds , lakes , and streams in the temperate and tropical regions			0
they are multicellular organisms which are usually just a few millimetres long			0
biologists are especially interested in hydra due to their regenerative abilities - they appear not to age or to die of old age			2
@entity26 have a tubular body up to 10 mm long when extended , secured by a simple adhesive foot called the basal disc			0
gland cells in the basal disc secrete a sticky fluid that give it adhesive properties			0
at the free end of the body is a mouth opening surrounded by one to 12 thin , mobile tentacles			0
if hydra are alarmed or attacked , the tentacles can be retracted to small buds and the body column itself can be transformed to a small gelatinous sphere			0
scientists looked at ageing in 46 different species including mammals , plants , fungi and algae			1
while humans , mammals and birds were found to weaken with age , other organisms such as tortoises and certain trees become stronger			2
evolutionary biologist dr @entity79 , from the @entity80 , said : ‘ many people , including scientists , tend to think that ageing is inevitable and occurs in all organisms on @entity83 as it does for humans ; that every species becomes weaker with age and more likely to die			1
but that is not the case			0
’ the team studied ageing in species from oak trees and seaweed , roundworms and lice , to lions and baboons			0
they examined 11 mammals , 12 other vertebrates , 10 invertebrates , 12 plants and one algae			2
‘ the diversity of mortality and fertility patterns in these organisms surprised us and there is clearly a need for more research before we fully understand the evolutionary causes of ageing and become better able to address problems of ageing in humans , ’ dr @entity79 said			0
the desert tortoise ( pictured ) experiences its highest mortality early on in life and is decreasingly likely to die as it ages			1
it can live for up to 80 years ageing in mammals and birds has been studied by scientists in the past , but this study , which was published in the journal nature , looked at the relatively unexplored area of ageing in other groups of vertebrates , invertebrates , plants algae and fungi			1
amazingly there are species that have constant mortality and are unaffected by the ageing process			1
the freshwater polyp @entity14 has constant low mortality and in laboratory conditions its risk of dying is so low that it is effectively immortal			2
‘ extrapolation from laboratory data show that even after 1,400 years five per cent of a hydra population kept in these conditions would still be alive ’ , said dr @entity79			0
for many species mortality increases with age , a pattern seen in most mammal species including humans and killer whales , but also in invertebrates like water fleas			1
however , other species buck the trend by experiencing a decrease in mortality as they age			1
for example , the desert tortoise experiences its highest mortality early on in life and is decreasingly likely to die as it ages and can live for up to 80 years			1
many plant species , such as the white mangrove tree , follow the same pattern			1
there are also species that become more and more fertile with age , including plants such as the agave ( pictured ) , which are found in @entity176 and @entity177 several species , including rhododendrons , common lizards and hermit crabs , show very little change in mortality throughout their life course			1
the researchers also looked at fertility patterns of the 46 species and found they varied greatly , while human fertility is characterised by being concentrated in a relatively short period of life			1
however , there are also species - particularly plants - that become more and more fertile with age , such as the agave , which is found in @entity176 and @entity177			2
the nematode worm or roundworm starts its life fertile and then suddenly loses the ability to reproduce			0
the scientists concluded a species can have increasing mortality and still live a long time , or have declining mortality and still live a long time			2
‘ it makes no sense to consider ageing to be based on how old a species can become , ’ said dr @entity79			0
‘ instead , it is more interesting to define ageing as being based on the shape of mortality trajectories - whether rates increase , decrease or remain constant with age			1

biologists from the @entity80 believe @entity14 , is almost completely unaffected by the ageing process
the scientists looked at ageing in 46 different species including mammals , plants , fungi and algae
they *identified* a number of species that experience a decrease in mortality as they age such as the desert tortoise and the white mangrove tree
