the father twisted his daughter 's limbs and shook her violently the man , who was 20 at the time of the attacks , initially denied responsibility before admitting to the court , ' ( @entity33 ) lost control of myself and just shook my baby instead			1
' according to court documents , during the first assault the man twisted his baby 's limbs and violently shook her , as he ' took his anger out over his financial woes and frustrations generally on his six - week - old baby			1

' such behaviour in a child is challenging even for mature and experienced parents , which certainly the offender was not			0
' it has to be recognised that a parent is capable of lashing out in frustration when dealing with a crying baby			0

in the judgement handed down on friday , justice @entity87 said : ' @entity11 , in my view , is correct to submit that the sentencing judge regarded this finding as lessening the respondent 's moral culpability for the offence that occurred			1
' his honour 's specific reference to the capacity of a parent to lash out in frustration ' when dealing with a crying baby ' , is a direct finding of fact that this is what occurred in these circumstances			2
' this was an erroneous finding			0
the evidence did not permit that finding to be made			0
' justice @entity87 also ruled that the sentencing judge in 2013 had not taken into consideration the objective seriousness of the crime			2
as a result , the defendant was given a light sentence			0

@entity11 appealed the 2013 sentencing of young man who shook his baby
@entity138 shook his newborn daughter and twisted her limbs twice in 2011
infant suffered 15 fractures and a brain injury , but no permanent damage
@entity138 was given a minimum sentence of two years in december 2013
@entity149 argued the sentence was too light on several grounds
trial found there us *insufficient* evidence to prove the child was crying
@entity159 ruled that the infant 's crying does not reduce the father 's moral culpability
the father , who ca *n't* be named , will be jailed for minimum of four years
