@entity1 are seven points from safety , even if @entity81 are dropping like a stone having played a game more			1
@entity1 ’s match in hand is against @entity86			1
@entity87 was at the @entity88 as a guest of the club he served so well in two @entity92 triumphs			0
this season is heading for a more sombre conclusion to those heady days			0
@entity95 is realistic , knowing uncommon improvement is needed immediately			1
‘ we ’ve got ten games left , six at home , we probably need to win five , ’ he said having seen his side win only four times all campaign			2
‘ when the pressure was on us to go and create i do n’t think we did			0
’ @entity53 was disappointed at a different aspect , the clamour for a card from @entity1 players when @entity108 tackled @entity41 in the second half			1
the ball was won but referee @entity111 produced a yellow , soon after erring similarly in booking @entity113			0
@entity1 keeper @entity15 punches clear as @entity114 of @entity11 and @entity115 of the @entity116 vie for the ball ‘ there is a raging debate about @entity86 in midweek			1
i ’ve seen everybody surround @entity108 for a red card for his challenge			0
for me it is a perfectly decent challenge i would expect a centre - half to make , ’ said @entity53			1
‘ if we ’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around , whinging , trying to get people yellow cards and red cards			0
for me it ’s not right			0
’ when a game begins with six centre - halves on the pitch there is a reasonable assumption goals will be in short supply			2
@entity31 of @entity11 attempts to keep possession at the @entity88 under pressure from @entity1 's @entity43 @entity1 matched @entity11 in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation , with half a dozen genuine defenders concentrating solely on keeping the ball away from danger			1
they did their jobs well , in a contest that began so short on opportunities or entertainment mass narcolepsy was an entirely possible outcome			0
it took @entity1 until 62 minutes to register a shot on target , and even that was a mishit cross by @entity30 , requiring a palm over from @entity9			1
@entity11 were only marginally better , but should have gone ahead in the 20th minute only for @entity61 to get himself in a terrible tangle			1
in a contender for miss of the season , he failed to put boot to ball from six yards with the net open			0
@entity7 chipped the ball over the backline of blue shirts to find @entity55 sprinting clear , having timed his run perfectly to stay onside			1
the @entity166 squared the ball to take out @entity15 but @entity61 failed badly			0
six minutes later he did have the ball in the back of the net			0
but @entity25 had already blown for a foul on @entity15 by @entity63			0
@entity1 ’s best opening of the first - half came in the 34th minute when @entity41 delivered a wicked cross that bent into the area in front of @entity45			1
but the £ 9million striker was either caught on his heels or disinclined to make the leap required to meet the ball and it drifted wide			0
@entity7 puts in a robust challenge on @entity1 striker @entity45 during the @entity23 clash on saturday referee @entity25 hands out the yellow card to @entity11 defender @entity108 ( left ) as tempers threatened to boil over this was a bad game for @entity45 , unable to affect it in any way and he was hooked for @entity46 after an hour			1
soon after @entity61 headed over from a corner by @entity57			0
that is when @entity1 began to make a more concerted effort to win three points rather than one			1
@entity30 was a nuisance all match for the @entity11 defenders , his pace and energy unsettling			2
it was he who stretched his legs down the left before cutting in and forcing @entity7 into a foul he wished not to make			2
he tried to back out of it but the contact sent @entity30 to the floor			0
@entity18 of @entity11 has his head in his hands after a missed chance to fire the @entity211 into the lead at the @entity88 @entity25 , soon after dishing out two wholy incorrect bookings for ‘ fouls ’ by @entity52 and @entity53 , got this yellow right			2
from the free - kick @entity44 struck a shot that was heading in until @entity46 inadvertently blocked			2
with the man advantage @entity1 pressed but without cultivating anything to truly worry @entity53			2
the crowd willed the ball in for the final few minutes but boos greeted the final whistle			0
this felt like a fatal opportunity missed .			0
