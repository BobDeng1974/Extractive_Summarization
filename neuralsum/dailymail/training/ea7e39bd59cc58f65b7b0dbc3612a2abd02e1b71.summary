by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 10:12 est , 8 march 2013 at the age of just 28 , @entity1 is facing the fact she has a high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer as she is a carrier of the deadly @entity9 gene			1
now @entity1 , from @entity10 , has taken the brave decision to have a double mastectomy this month to reduce her chances of one day developing the disease			1
the young mother told the @entity16 her decision to have surgery was a ' no brainer ' but her ordeal has been helped thanks to @entity22 going through the same procedure			1
cancer risk : @entity1 , pictured with her daughter @entity25 , is a carrier of the deadly @entity9 gene she said : ' @entity22 has been a role model for me to look up to			1
there 's not much support for people my age going through this but she has brought it into the public eye			0
as she has been so open about what she 's been through , it has made me feel like i can be more open too			0
' before some of my friends did n't understand why i was having my breasts removed when i do n't actually have cancer			2
now it 's easier to say , ' i have what @entity22 has , ' and they understand			2
@entity22 , 33 , had a double mastectomy last year after discovering she was a carrier of the @entity47 gene			1
the gene means carriers have an 85 per cent chance of getting breast cancer and a 60 per cent chance of contracting ovarian cancer in her lifetime			1
she said at the time she was under - going the operation for the sake of her daughter , @entity60 , 14 months			0
putting the condition in the public eye : @entity1 said it has helped her seeing another young mother , singer @entity22 , pictured with daughter @entity60 , going through the same thing ' as a mum you never want to anticipate leaving your child without a mum			1
the whole point of this was to get the dark cloud away from my head and to get on with life , and i 'm on that path now so i just want to look towards the future , ' @entity22 said			0
@entity1 , who is a mother to @entity25 , 16 months , said she feels exactly the same way			2
her own mother developed breast cancer when she was a teenager ( she since recovered after treatment ) and her aunt died last year in her fifties after contracting ovarian cancer			1
after seeing what her mother and aunt went through , @entity1 said she would hate for her own daughter to see her battling cancer			1
' i do n't want my daughter to see me suffering from cancer			2
as soon as i found out i carried the gene , it was a not a case of ' if ' but ' when ' i would have a mastectomy ' she said : ' i saw my mum suffer from cancer growing up , it 's really hard to see someone you love like that			1
' i do n't want my daughter to see me suffering			0
as soon as i found out i carried the gene , it was a not a case of ' if ' but ' when ' i would have a mastectomy			0
having it now means @entity25 will be too young to remember any of it			0
' @entity1 said she has the full support of her family and partner , @entity110 , which made the decision to have a mastectomy easier			2
' @entity110 has been completely supportive , he just wants me to get it done			0
if i was n't in a stable relationship i might have felt differently but as i know i 've met my partner for life , it does n't bother me to have a mastectomy , ' she said			0
@entity1 is scheduled to have her operation on march 22 and said seeing @entity22 back performing with @entity121 on the @entity122 so soon after her surgery has been reassuring			2
reassuring : after having a double mastectomy at the end of last year , @entity22 has already returned to performing with reformed @entity126 said it has helped seeing how quickly she has recovered ' it has been nice to see how quickly she has recovered , ' she said			1
as @entity1 wants to have more children , she will not yet have her ovaries removed			0
doctors also recommend women do n't do this until their late thirties or early forties because the risk of developing ovarian cancer is lower and the operation can bring on symptoms of the menopause			0
there is a chance that @entity1 will have passed the @entity9 gene on to her daughter but said she will wait until she is at least 18 to discuss it with her and see if she then wants to be tested			1
she said : ' i found out at 28 and it was a lot to get my head around			0
so i wo n't tell her till she 's at least 18 , even then she might be too young to handle it			2
if she does have the gene i will fully support her and i can help her from my own experience			0
' @entity9 and @entity47 are human genes that belong to a class known as tumor suppressors			0
mutation of these genes has been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer a woman 's risk of developing breast and / or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a @entity9 or @entity47 mutation			1
men with these mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer gene faults are extremely rare with only about 1 in 20 cases of breast cancer associated with a faulty inherited gene if women have concerns about their family history of breast cancer , they should go see their gp			1
if their family history suggests they might be at increased risk of developing breast cancer , the @entity178 may refer them on to a specialist family history or genetics service where their options for genetic testing and / or managing their risk can be discussed this @entity188 , help raise vital funds for @entity190 to stop women dying from the disease			2

mother - of - one @entity1 , 28 , will have double mastectomy after discovering she carries deadly @entity9 gene
she said it has helped seeing another young mother , @entity22 , go through same procedure
friends understand her *situation* when she tells them ' it 's same thing @entity22 has '
@entity1 's own mother battled breast cancer when she was growing up and she does n't want her daughter to see her like that
