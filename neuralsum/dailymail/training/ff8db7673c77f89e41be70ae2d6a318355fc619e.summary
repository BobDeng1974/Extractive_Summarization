waking up and travelling to work in the dark can make the day ahead seem unbearable			0
to solve this , one train company has come up with the world 's first ' therapy carriage ' - which is designed to make people less depressed about the weather			1
the unique carriage was decked out with bright lights which are used to help treat people who suffer from a winter depression known as ' @entity12 ' ( @entity12 )			1
and this morning 's 7.06am @entity14 train from @entity26 to @entity27 , @entity28 , was full of special @entity19 lights - which are designed to help treat @entity12			1
@entity14 collaborated with charity the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , to see how they could brighten passenger 's journeys as the winter blues take their toll			0
@entity12 is caused by a chemical imbalance due to the shortening of daylight hours , and the lack of sunlight in winter			1
seasonal affective disorder ( @entity12 ) is a type of depression that has a seasonal pattern			1
the episodes of depression tend to occur at the same time each year , usually during the winter			2
as with other types of depression , the two main symptoms of @entity12 are a low mood and a lack of interest in life			1
sufferers may also be less active than normal and sleep more			0
being animals , humans are all affected to some extent by changes in light and the seasons			0
most people like comfort food and tend to feel more lethargic in winter			0
for about 20 per cent of the @entity65 population , mildly debilitating symptoms of @entity12 cause discomfort but not serious suffering			2
this is called ' @entity70 ' or ' @entity12 '			2
for about 2 per cent , @entity12 is a seriously disabling illness which prevents them from functioning normally without the appropriate treatment			2
source : @entity31 ( @entity75 ) the @entity12 lights , which were installed in the carriages , help alleviate symptoms of depression during the dark winter days			1
this is because they reproduce daylight and provide bright light which it 's claimed increases levels of alertness , boosts mood and improves overall day - to - day performance			1
the lights offer high levels of light intensity as they each deliver 10,000 @entity91 - the method in which the intensity of visible light is measured - which is said to be enough bright light to get the body clock back on track			1
during a bright day , the level of brightness ranges from 10,000 to 25,000 @entity91			0
@entity101 from @entity14 said : ' with the dark winter mornings and evenings , and @entity104 blues , the first few months of the year are traditionally a time when people look to book a summer holiday , or a long weekend away , often taking advantage of the longer daylight hours on the south coast			0
' until then , we are trying to shine a ray of light on people 's journeys , and help them arrive at work and travel home again without the " winter blues "			0
' @entity120 , from @entity31 , added : ' with the continual lack of light and a long , cold january after the @entity123 celebrations , this time of year is the peak time people suffer symptoms of @entity12			2
' we are pleased @entity14 is taking this step to help alleviate passengers suffering with @entity19 lights on board			0
' the 7.06am service runs daily to @entity28 , a region which averages over ten more hours of sunshine a month in january than the rest of the @entity65 , according to the @entity136			0
@entity28 averages 58 hours of sunshine in january , compared with an average of just 47 hours across the @entity65 as a whole			0
january and february is the peak time for @entity12 , which is caused by a chemical imbalance due to the shortening of daylight hours , and the lack of sunlight in winter			1

train company has made a ' therapy carriage ' containing ' happy lamps '
happy lamps are lights used to treat @entity12 ( @entity12 )
these bright lights reproduce daylight - which boosts mood and alertness
@entity12 , a type of seasonal depression , peaks in january and february
