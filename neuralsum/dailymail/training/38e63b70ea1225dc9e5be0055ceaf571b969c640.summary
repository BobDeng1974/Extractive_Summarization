it 's a tragic life when all you live for is to hate @entity2			1
there are some strange people around but i think the strangest of all must be those who ca n't wait for the weekend so that they can totally ignore the reality of what 's actually happening , and instead work overtime to twist and fabricate anything @entity2 do into some sort of massive failure			1
these people belong to a special sect – @entity15			0
@entity18 's @entity2 have three more points than they did under @entity20 last year @entity20 was sacked by @entity2 after one season - @entity22 's points tally was identical up to last week the @entity2 haters have come out in force to laugh at the @entity26 giants during their struggles it 's a world where you have no love for anything in particular , but you do thrive and flourish off an irrational hatred for @entity2			1
it 's a peculiarity of the insecure @entity35 nation that results in a dislike of anyone who does well for themselves			0
it also results in a display of an abnormal level of pleasure when those who achieve happiness or success fail or stumble			0
in the weird world of these people @entity18 is no better at football management than @entity20			1
i could end the column here and leave you to ponder on that for a moment , but contractual demands and a desire to hammer home the point will force my hand and compel me to continue			0
in case you 're not aware , @entity22 has won titles with every club he 's managed ( including a remarkable and unlikely success six years ago with @entity64 ) , he 's won the @entity65 and he 's been to a @entity67 semi-final			1
he 's not the greatest coach the world has seen , but he is n't far off , and you do n't have to have played the game to work out that his record stands up against that of @entity20			1
then - @entity74 boss @entity22 speaking with former @entity2 manager sir @entity75 in 1998 so , this debate has developed – are united better off under @entity22 ? has he done better than @entity20 did ? ' he 's only got the same number of points , ' the united - haters cried last week , ahead of the @entity81 match - @entity22 now has three more - before following up with the inevitable : ' and he 's spent way more than @entity20 did			1
' ( probably because @entity20 did n't know who to sign , and even if he did those players did n't want to play for him )			2
points totals are irrelevant to @entity2 this season			2
@entity22 will be judged solely , and rightly , on whether they finish in the top four			0
so even if @entity2 finish with fewer points than @entity20 accumulated last season at @entity92 , it will not matter at all , so long as they finish in the top four			1
it really is that simple			0
and so far @entity22 's record stands up to @entity20 ' record : the @entity97 took @entity2 from first to seventh , @entity22 has taken them from seventh to fourth			1
i 've watched the film @entity100 and i 'm inspired by @entity101 , so i may have some sort of subliminal advantage			0
but in truth i 'm a proper maths duffer who scraped a b at o - level , yet even i can work out @entity22 has improved things so far this season			2
@entity22 pictured during the @entity65 semi-final with @entity112 in 2010 @entity22 ( high - fiving @entity113 ) went to the @entity67 and got to the semi-final with @entity116 last year and yes he has spent a lot of money , but offset that against the fact that all of those new signings have been injured - often large parts of the season - and you 'll see it 's not been straightforward			1
unless of course you sit in a room and play football on your computer all day ( highly likely in the case of haters up and down the country – your mum will bring your tea up on a tray soon )			0
apparently on these games you can be manager of @entity136 or @entity137 , you can put a £ 60million player straight in your line - up and take your team from the conference to the @entity26 title and even win the @entity65			1
i 've never seen these games – i prefer the real thing			0
and i can reveal some shocking news to these keyboard clowns - 40 years of going to games has confirmed to me that real football does n't work like it does on your monitors			1
the @entity150 have found plenty of sticks to beat @entity2 with this season , so let 's take a look at a few more and rip them to shreds			2
on saturday it was the fans who apparently forced @entity22 's hand as he changed tactics at @entity81			2
he 's changed tactics before during games , he will change them again i 'm sure			0
@entity163 watches on as his shot goes past @entity81 goalkeeper @entity165 to make sure of the three points the 19 - year - old striker ( left ) came on as a second - half substitute to wrap up the 2 - 0 victory for the visitors @entity163 celebrates scoring @entity2 's second goal of the game to open his account for the season it was the fans who apparently forced @entity22 's hand as he changed tactics at @entity81 , or so they say you must either be incredibly stupid , or passionately hate @entity2 if you think this experienced coach , who 's navigated his way to three @entity65 finals in his career , was lost for ideas until the away fans gave him some tips			1
listening to pundits after the game you 'd think @entity2 had n't won on saturday at @entity188			1
@entity189 showed their normal fight , and heaped on the pressure at the end , but @entity2 won 2 - 0 at a ground where even the champions could n't win this season			1
credit where it 's due ? not likely			0
this is @entity2 , they wo n't get any credit			2
and the one that has had the @entity150 dribbling saliva from the corners of their mouths : @entity205			0
the @entity206 is a @entity2 - hater 's dream			1
he 's costing a fortune			0
@entity81 's goalkeeper @entity165 ( left ) rushes out to deny @entity205 when the @entity206 takes a shot at him @entity212 ( left ) and @entity213 of @entity81 challenge @entity205 during the first half at @entity188 he 's on big wages for sure , but that 's what a player like @entity205 commands in the current market			2
it seems the @entity205 critics are unaware of his existence before he arrived at @entity2			1
he scored nine in 13 for @entity224 in qualifying for the @entity225 and i was gutted he was n't there in @entity227			0
but his recovery from an anterior cruciate ligament injury has been long and slow			0
@entity2 took a chance on his fitness , but it was a reduced risk – they did n't have to hand out a four - year contract			1
before the injury , @entity205 was undoubtedly one of the finest players in the world			0
you must have been sleeping through his time at @entity238 if you ca n't acknowledge that			0
a 100 per cent fit and sharp @entity205 would surely be devastating in the @entity26			2
and yet abus are trying to convince us he 's useless			0
why ? at @entity189 his finishing was poor , but the quality of his runs passed by the eye of the uneducated ( or wilfully blind )			0
@entity205 was on fire during the qualifiers for the @entity225 for @entity224 @entity205 smashes a shot towards the @entity81 goal for @entity2 but the striker could not get on the scoresheet here are just a couple of examples from the highlights alone : in the 13th minute , @entity205 drops off his marker , @entity257 finds him with a great pass and he 's through on goal			1
ten minutes into the second half and he sprints as @entity2 counter , finds acres of space on the edge of the box but @entity267 chooses the wrong pass and goes wide			0
when the ball comes in , @entity205 has cleverly held his run , stays on side , heads on target , but @entity165 saves			0
when @entity267 opens the scoring , @entity205 is unmarked in the six - yard box			2
and in the last minute , @entity205 has sprinted into the box , left @entity212 for dead to find space , but @entity163 elects to shoot , his effort is saved but fortunately for the youngster the ball falls back at his feet and he fires home			0
the runs are there , but the finishing is n't			0
he 's back to his best in his mind , and needs to follow it up in all aspects of his game			0
@entity22 's record speaks for itself and it proves he can become a better coach for @entity2 than @entity20 @entity267 ( left ) scored during @entity2 's 2 - 0 win at @entity81 though you would never know judging by the punditry ' the worst miss of the season ' declared so many on @entity297 ( always the best place for educated and considered reflection on the day 's football – by saturday night this social media hate - spot has descended into a stream of four - letter words and musings on celebrity big brother ) after @entity205 had seemingly swung his foot and missed the ball three yards out of @entity165 's virtually empty net			1
i suppose if you choose to totally ignore the crucial intervention of @entity313 which deflected the ball out of @entity205 's path at the last minute then it would be a terrible miss. but then why would you distort the facts and not report it properly ? probably because it 's enjoyable for some to knock @entity2 when they have nothing better in their lives			1
i do n't know if @entity2 will finish in the top four , but i do know they 're not perfect , and they look a long way off a title challenge			2
but i 'll give you some facts : @entity2 were great			2
they are n't great right now , but they will be great again			2
some strange people will need to steel themselves for that painful moment in their lives			1
@entity22 's @entity2 are n't great at the moment but they will come good in the @entity26 once again @entity2 find themselves fourth in the @entity26 table ahead of saturday 's visit to @entity81			1

@entity2 have three more points under @entity18 than they did under @entity20 in the @entity26 after 22 games
but those criticising them are the @entity2 - hating keyboard *warriors*
@entity22 has won titles with every club he 's managed
@entity297 *overreacted* to @entity205 's misses - he 'll come good yet
@entity2 are n't great right now but they will be great again , and those saying otherwise will need to prepare for that painful moment in their lives
