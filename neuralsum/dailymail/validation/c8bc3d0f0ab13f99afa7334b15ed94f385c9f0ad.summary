@entity41 was dismissed one run short of his half - century at the start of the 37th over , bowled by @entity49 , who claimed figures of three for 63			0
@entity9 had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught - and - bowled chance trying to go down the ground to @entity54 , and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from @entity56 straight to @entity54 at short third man			0
his departure signalled the arrival of @entity60 , though , and his quick - fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the @entity63 score racing along			0

@entity83 and @entity84 put on 63 in a fourth - wicket stand that provided a brief respite , but when @entity83 ( 39 ) sent @entity88 's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again			0
