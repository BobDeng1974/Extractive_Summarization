by @entity0 last updated at 2:06 pm on 12th january 2012 @entity2 's ' tasteless ' antics have sparked fury at the @entity5 @entity4 , which has written to the @entity7 demanding they apologise for a @entity11 @entity10 special			1
the controversial star caused outrage with an episode set in @entity5 in which he strips to his boxer shorts in front of his hosts and hangs offensive banners on trains			1
staff at the @entity4 complained that the programme was ' replete with cheap jibes , tasteless humour and lacked cultural sensitivity			1
' toilet humour : the @entity7 admitted that 23 people complained after the @entity10 special , in which the presenters attach a lavatory to their car before driving around @entity5 ' @entity31 ' : @entity2 strips to his underwear in front of his @entity5 hosts they fired off emails and letters to the show 's producer , @entity41 - copying in @entity7 director general @entity42 - expressing ' deep disappointment ' at the content of @entity11 : @entity5 @entity45			1
a spokesman for the @entity4 said it had received hundreds of complaints after the special was repeated twice over @entity10			1
diplomats had consented to the programme being shot in the country after receiving a letter from mr @entity41 describing it as a ' light - hearted road trip '			2
but the consulate complained in a letter that the content of the show was ' in breach of this agreement ' and said the @entity7 would need to ' assuage the hurt sentiments of a huge number of people '			2
the incident is the latest in a string of gaffes by the badly behaved @entity2			2
just yesterday he claimed that @entity68 was full of immigrants from the @entity71 refugee camp in @entity72			2
embarrassing : an insulting banner attached to a train in @entity5 by the @entity7 team offensive : when the carriages split the banner 's double meaning became clear earlier this week , he used his newspaper column to compare the @entity83 tragedy in which 23 @entity85 migrant workers died with synchronised swimming			1
back in november , the motormouth presenter horrified public sector workers by saying strikers should be shot			2
embarrassingly for @entity90 , @entity91 features at the start of the @entity11 special , waving to @entity2 and telling him to ' stay away from @entity5 '			1
the @entity7 admitted it received 23 complaints after the programme , which remains available online			2
it confirmed it had received a letter from the @entity5 @entity4 and said it would respond in due course			1
@entity2 , 51 , is one of the @entity7 's highest paid stars , having earned Â£ 2.14million from his involvement in the @entity11 last year			0
but the wayward star may caused serious damage to the broadcaster and its image abroad			2
' we conveyed our disappointment , ' said a minister from the @entity4			1
' the show was crass and misunderstanding of @entity5 culture			1
' lots of people have complained to us , both @entity5 and @entity90			1
they are deeply offended and expect us to do something			0
' we do n't think this is the government 's view , but we want the @entity7 to stop repeating this programme and take action			0
' rude : the @entity11 team attached this ' eat @entity122 muffins ' banner to the side of an @entity5 train shocking : again the carriages divided to display an obscene slogan bad steer : @entity2 and his fellow @entity11 presenters @entity128 ( left ) and @entity130 in @entity131 after filming there			1
@entity91 features in the special episode the outline of the @entity11 special said the show would involve ' spontaneous interaction between the presenters and their environment '			0
it claimed that the key aspects would be ' beautiful scenery , busy city scenes , local charm and colour ' , emphasising @entity5 's ' local car culture '			1
instead , @entity2 and his co-presenters drove around in a @entity148 with a toilet fixed to the boot			0
showing off the car 's unusual modification as he drove around the slums , @entity2 boasted : ' this is perfect for @entity5 because everyone who comes here gets the trots			1
' they also hung up banners that read ' @entity90 it is good for your company ' and ' eat @entity122 muffins ' , which turned into offensive messages when the carriages pulled them apart			1
it is not the first time the show has run into trouble after venturing abroad			0
the @entity7 was forced to apologise to the @entity172 ambassador last year after derogatory remarks about ' @entity172 characteristics ' made by @entity2 and his co-hosts			0
asked whether mr @entity91 regretted his involvement in the programme , the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' as you know , the @entity7 are able to film in @entity131 as are other broadcast companies			0
they were in the street and he was leaving for an event			0
' the government is not responsible for editorial decisions made by the @entity7 or any media organisation			0
this is a matter for the @entity7 - i do n't speak for the @entity7			0
' asked why mr @entity91 had written a letter to the programme which was read out at its opening , the spokesman said : ' when people write to the prime minister , or indeed any other government minister , it is customary to reply			0
' 21 july 2011 from @entity41 , @entity11 producer , to @entity199 , @entity200 ' @entity2 , @entity130 and @entity128 will travel across @entity5 in three cars filming a light hearted road trip focusing on the journey and the inevitable idiosyncrasies of the cars they will drive , as well as the country and scenery we see along the way			1
' there will be spontaneous interaction between the presenters and their environment , and potentially people they meet along the way			0
this will be in an incidental manner , not interviews			0
' key ingredients of what we film will be beautiful scenery , busy city scenes , local charm and colour within these locations , areas to illustrate the local car culture that exists in @entity5			1
' 6 january 2012 from @entity5 high commission to mr @entity41 cc @entity42 , @entity7 director general ' the programme was replete with cheap jibes , tasteless humour and lacked cultural sensitivity			2
this is not clearly what we expect of the @entity7			0
i write this to convey our deep disappointment over the documentary for its content and the tone of the presentation			0
' you are clearly in breach of the agreement that you had entered into , completely negating our constructive and proactive facilitation			0
we strongly protest and expect the @entity7 to make amends , especially to assuage the hurt sentiments of a large number of people			0
