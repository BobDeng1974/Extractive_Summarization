mr @entity1 ( pictured ) is the operator of the @entity9 in @entity4 in central @entity5 the reason for the high security in the early hours of january 18 was that two men who had just been executed on @entity23 off the southern coast of @entity25 had wished to be cremated			1
their remains were ferried by ambulance under police escort to @entity29 and handed over to mr @entity1 while the men 's relatives assembled for a @entity33 ceremony to honour their loved ones			1
after a six hour process - three hours in the furnace and three cooling down - mr @entity1 opened the heavy doors of his two ovens and gently swept out the ashes for two terracotta urns			1

heavy roller beds on mini railway tracks transport the remains into each furnace , which are then closed off by a brick door weighing 1,000kg and sealed with wet dirt these are the tools mr @entity1 uses to collect the ashes of the dead			1
prisoners who are executed on nusakambangan are taken to his crematorium while @entity0 television has broadcast detailed recreations of the @entity0 method of execution by a highly trained paramilitary mobile unit armed with sophisticated weaponry , much of mr @entity1 's equipment for disposing of remains seemed steeped in centuries past			1
the @entity9 lives up a dusty lane from the village in southwestern central @entity25 's @entity115 province , one hour 's drive north of the port to nusakambangan island			0
from the outside it looks like an old primary school with peeling painted concrete and an open sided area for waiting relatives			0
