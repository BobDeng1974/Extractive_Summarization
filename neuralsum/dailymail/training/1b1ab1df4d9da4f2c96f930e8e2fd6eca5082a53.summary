watch out world , the @entity0 are going digital to sell you cookies			1
after nearly 100 years of selling door to door , @entity0 will allow its young go - getters to push their wares using a mobile app or personalized websites - but only if their scout councils and guardians say ok			1
' girls have been telling us that they want to go into this space , ' said @entity14 , chief digital cookie executive for the organization covering about two million girls			1
' online is where entrepreneurship is going			0
' going digital : @entity22 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) practice selling cookies on a tablet now that the organization has allowed online sales and the best news for these digital natives : they can have cookies shipped directly to your doorstep			1
more than one million scouts , from kindergarten - age daisies to teens , were expected to opt in as cookie - selling season cranks up this month and the scouting organization gets digital sales underway			1
but digital sales are intended to enhance , not replace , the paper spreadsheets used to generate an estimated $ 800 million in cookie sales a year - at anywhere from $ 3.50 to $ 5 a box , depending on scout council			1
there are important e-lessons here , scout officials said , such as better articulating and tracking goals , learning to handle customers and money in a new way , and more efficiently processing credit card information			0
' a lot of people have asked , " what took you so long to get online ? " we spend a lot of time thinking how do we make this safe , scalable and smart , ' @entity62 , chief communications executive for @entity0 , said at a recent demonstration for select media			1
councils were offered one of the two platforms but not both			0
for web - based sales , scouts customize their pages , using their first names only , and email prospective customers with links to click on for orders			1
they can also put up videos explaining who they are and what they plan to do with their proceeds			0
the mobile platform offers tabs for tracking sales and allows for the sale of bundles of different kinds of cookies			1
it can be used on a phone or tablet			0
screen time : girl scouts are seen learning how to sell cookies on the organization 's website using laptops ' they can get them quicker than waiting for me to deliver them because sometimes it takes me a long time to deliver , ' offered 11 - year - old @entity102 at the preview			1
the adults at the event asked that only first names of scouts be used			1
added seven - year - old @entity108 : ' my favorite part is that now i can sell more @entity110			1
' she pulled down about 200 boxes last year and has upped her goal to 600			0
girl scouts use their cookie money to pay for community service work or troop activities such as camping and other trips			1
the websites will not be accessible without an email invitation , requiring the girls to build client lists			2
and personal information is as protected as any digits out there , for both the scouts and customers , using encryption in some cases			2
much of the responsibility to limit identifying details about scouts online falls on parents			2
troop leader @entity135 of the @entity136 has an 11 - year - old scout and is particularly psyched about the digital options			2
they live in a house rather than an apartment , and she and her husband work at home , eliminating at - office cookie and neighborly building sales			2
@entity147 news : customers can now have @entity110 ( pictured ) and other girl scout cookies shipped directly to their doorstep ' during cookie season my daughter is wearing her ( scout ) vest on the subway and people are so excited to see a @entity110 , ' ms @entity135 explained			2
' strangers actually will buy a case of cookies and wait for her to call			2
this is going to be amazing because now she can just say " give me your business card , " or " i 'll take your email address , " send the email and they can be delivered			0
this is gon na be sweet			0
' ms @entity135 also sees word - of - mouth value in getting cookies delivered quickly			0
' people are going to be walking around with cookies and others are going to say , " whoa , how did you get those already ? " ' @entity176 of @entity177 has a nine - year - old scout who sold more than 1,000 boxes last year			0
she hopes to increase her goal to 1,500 this season and went through training to learn how to set up her new cookie website			0
but dad wo n't be letting her loose alone			0
' i 'll be sitting in the backseat to help her , certainly when it comes to credit cards , things of that sort , ' he said			0
' but it makes perfect sense to have it be on the computer			0
it 's definitely time the @entity0 came into the 21st century			1

more than one million scouts are expected to start using a mobile app and personalized websites to sell cookies later this month
digital sales are intended to enhance , not replace , the paper spreadsheets @entity0 have *traditionally* used
