by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:35 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 14:27 est , 20 may 2013 @entity2 , the 26 - year - old who has just sold his fantastically popular blogging site @entity5 to @entity6 for a $ 1.1billion cash deal , made the announcement today and signed off with a resounding ' f * * * yeah '			1
@entity2 , a high school drop - out who started the site from his mother 's @entity15 apartment in 2007 , posted a message on @entity5 's staff blog on monday			1
he told users that he was ' elated ' to be joining @entity6 and echoed the words of the company 's ceo @entity21 by saying : ' we wo n’t let you down			1
in closing , @entity2 wrote : ' as always , everything that @entity5 is , we owe to this unbelievable community			1
we wo n't let you down			1
' although @entity2 is now exceedingly wealthy following the @entity6 buyout of his start - up @entity5 , the $ 1.1billion cash deal still leaves the 26 - year - old short of the world 's youngest billionaires - some of whom have yet to see their 30th birthdays : the casual ' f * * * yeah ' , a somewhat brash sign - off to a billion - dollar deal , is reminiscent of another tech tycoon 's attitude to the world of multinational corporations			1
@entity61 once touted @entity63 business cards with the words ' i 'm ceo , b * * * * ' emblazoned on the front			0
@entity2 's announcement came after @entity6 's board of directors agreed on sunday to buy the wildly popular blogging platform @entity5 , which boasts 100million users and 90million posts per day , for $ 1.1billion cash			1
the deal makes the @entity75 the latest 20 - something tech tycoon , even though he was publicly opposed even last year , to selling the company which he founded in his mother 's small @entity28 apartment in 2007			1
however , @entity2 - a high school dropout who taught himself how to code - had expressed grave reservations about giving up his brainchild to a @entity82 tech giant			1
in a 2012 interview with the @entity84 , he said he had been swatting away buy - out requests for years			0
' particularly in the first three years , there were a lot of ( mergers and acquisitions ) people who would pull you aside and you 'd think " well , s * * * , i could be a pretty rich 23 - year - old with very little effort , " ' he said			0
' we stuck it out			0
i wo n't say i really knew why			1
' moving on up : @entity2 lives with his girlfriend @entity97 , a graduate student and chef , in a modest apartment in @entity28 's @entity100 big deal : the $ 1.1billion takeover of @entity5 is @entity21 's major move since she took over as @entity6 ceo in july			1
observers say she is using the deal to set the tone of her tenure at the company perhaps the perseverance makes sense to @entity2 now that he is ' very rich ' at age 26			2
the deal conjures images of another young man who is very rich - @entity63 founder @entity61			0
legendary : @entity63 ceo @entity61 's former business card also to a flippant approach at $ 1.1billion , @entity5 's worth is nowhere near the value of $ 100billion @entity63 , but 29 - year - old @entity61 's success has become something of a pattern for young , brilliant tech entrepreneurs			1
it is unclear how large a stake in the company @entity127 maintained before the @entity6 deal			2
in 2008 , he sold a 25 per cent stake to investors for $ 750,000			0
the investor share of the company was $ 125million at the time of the deal , according to @entity135			0
@entity2 grew up on @entity28 's @entity136 , the son of a music composer father who wrote songs for films and tv shows and a mother who was a teacher			1
he taught himself how to code html at age 11 and began setting up his own consulting business shortly thereafter			0
his parents allowed him to drop out of high school at age 15 and complete the remainder of his education by home - schooling			0
at age 17 , he moved to @entity153 , where he cemented his skill as a programmer and began pitching his ideas to tech companies			0
he moved back to @entity15 and sold his services as a consultant			0
he founded @entity5 in 2007 at age 21 - and it quickly consumed all of his time			1
he started up an office in @entity28 and has ardently resisted the lure of moving to @entity82			2
he also tried to resist the money that the tech world had to offer			0
he told the @entity84 that he wanted to remain independent - believing he could grow the company by growing ad revenue naturally			0
within a year , though , he was accepting funds from venture capital investors			0
he currently lives with his girlfriend @entity97 in a modest apartment in @entity28 's @entity100			1
miss @entity97 is a chef and a graduate student studying psychology			0
miss @entity97 has been @entity2 's constant companion at public events for several years on monday morning , @entity6 ceo @entity21 publicly announced the purchase of @entity5 with a post on her own @entity5 page - including an animated @entity181 image that acknowledged the public questions about the acquisition			1
her first words about the deal were : ' we promise not to screw it up			0
' @entity38 announced that @entity2 will stay on as ceo of @entity5 and continue to run and develop the site			1
despite a massive user base , @entity5 's revenue was only $ 13million last year			2
even that figure was only made possible after $ 125million in capital investments			0
the deal also faced almost immediate backlash from @entity5 users , who feared @entity6 's ownership would change the character of the site and water down the features that make it successful			1
@entity38 sought to allay concerns on both sides - and even used an internet meme to make light of the criticism			0
the gif she posted reads : ' @entity6			2
' instead , @entity38 urged users and @entity6 investors alike the ' @entity213 ' - a reference to a famous @entity216 propaganda poster produced during @entity217 tech news site @entity135 reports that @entity38 , who took over as @entity6 ceo in july , wanted to quickly snatch up @entity5 as ' the stake in the ground of what her strategy is going forward for @entity6			1
' @entity5 , which is a mico - blogging platform for quickly posting pictures , text and video , also functions as a social media site			2
its platform manages to blend elements of all of the major social networking sites			0
sharing and posting photos is simple and easy , like @entity234			0
gifs and videos are all easy to share , as well			0
but , the site also has a new feed function , allowing users to follow other @entity5 blogs like social media networks @entity63 and @entity242			1
very young and very rich : @entity2 and @entity97 , who enjoy spending their sunday mornings at brunch in @entity28 's @entity245 , are now due for a major lifestyle change the simple layout of @entity5 has spawned millions of diverse , quirky , blogs			1
an enormously popular @entity5 called ' # whatshouldwecallme ' features a series of animated gifs explaining the reactions to daily life of a 20 - something woman			2
however , celebrities like @entity255 and @entity256 also have popular @entity5 pages and companies like the shoemaker @entity260 use the site as a creative way to market their products			2
within hours of the $ 1.1billion buyout of microblogging site @entity5 by @entity6 , the backlash had already began online			1
much of the vitriol was directed at ceo @entity21 's attempt to make @entity6 cool again			1
@ kelsiemonster tweeted : ' @entity6 wants to sit at the cool kids ' table			2
' @ wongopher said : ' @entity6 buying @entity5 is like a 14 year - old 's uncool dad trying to make his own selfie a meme			1
' wordpress founder @entity277 wrote on his blog on sunday that since the @entity6 / @entity5 news began doing the rounds that 72,000 posts had been imported to @entity282 from @entity5 in one hour			1
the usual rate is around 400 an hour			0
@entity5 is also popular with many porn stars and features numerous sexually - explicit blogs			2
@entity5 boasts remarkable loyalty among its users			1
some 85percent of @entity5 users make 20 or more posts a month			1
@entity38 cited some of these facts when addressing critics who worried @entity6 was paying too much for a company that has yet to turn a profit			0
in her @entity5 post , she wrote : ' the combination of @entity5 + @entity6 could grow @entity6 ’s audience by 50 % to more than a billion monthly visitors , and could grow traffic by approximately 20 %			2
' in terms of working together , @entity5 can deploy @entity6 ’s personalization technology and search infrastructure to help its users discover creators , bloggers , and content they ’ll love			1
' she also addressed the fears of @entity5 users , who threatened to leave the service in droves or to otherwise protest the takeover			2
' @entity5 is incredibly special and has a great thing going			0
we will operate @entity5 independently			0
@entity2 will remain ceo , ' @entity38 wrote			2
' the product roadmap , their team , their wit and irreverence will all remain the same as will their mission to empower creators to make their best work and get it in front of the audience they deserve			0
@entity6 will help @entity5 get even better , faster			2
' unlike the famously - dressed - down @entity61 , @entity2 prefers wearing plaid instead of a hoody			0
but he 's not afraid to wear a suit , either .			0
