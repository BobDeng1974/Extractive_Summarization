mothers are ‘ worth less ’ to employers in the @entity3 than men , @entity0 claimed today			1
the @entity6 leader suggested women who take time off to have children are paid less because they lose contact with their client base and struggle to succeed when they return to work			1
hours after making the controversial remarks , mr @entity0 complained it was ' not very nice ' being clobbered over the head with a placard as he tried to enter push his way through an angry protest in @entity17			2
in highly - controversial remarks , mr @entity0 – who has previously defended the @entity3 ’s culture of drinking and strip clubs – said women can succeed in the industry as long as they are willing to ‘ sacrifice the family life ’			1
he also rejected the idea of becoming a stay - at - home father who allowed his wife to pursue a career			1
but hours later he was physically attacked as he tried to attend an event in @entity45 in @entity17			2
he said the incident , outside a hotel , was worse than when an angry mob blockaded him in an @entity50 pub last year			2
' in @entity52 they cane along to make a noise			2
here they came to bar me from actually physically entering this hotel , and with intent to physically hurt me , ' he told @entity58			0
' so that 's not very nice			0
i did n't like it but it is not going to stop me			0
' @entity6 leader @entity0 said women who take time off to have children lose their client base and become less valuable to employers @entity79 ‘ lap dancing ? do n’t have the time these days , but i used to go to them			1
like it or not , they are a fact of life			0
you are talking about normal behaviour there			0
everyone does it ... @entity76 and lap dancing are not the same thing , they can be but not usually			0
' @entity80 ’ll tell you something			0
i work an 18 hour day most days and i think i ’m entitled at lunchtime to a pint			0
' @entity84 can not believe that a young @entity85 leaving @entity86 today would join the conservative party led by @entity88			0
i think she ’d come and get involved in @entity6			1
' on @entity91 president @entity89 have the charisma of a damp rag , and the appearance of a low - grade bank clerk			0
and the question that i want to ask ... that we 're all going to ask , is " who are you ? "			0
i 'd never heard of you			0
nobody in @entity101 had ever heard of you			0
' on @entity102 was an extraordinary fellow			0
i admired him for having the guts to talk about an issue that seemed to be to be really rather important – immigration , society , how do we want to live in this country			0
' speaking in @entity109 this morning , mr @entity0 rejected the idea that the @entity3 is still an ‘ old boys ’ although he admitted that in the 1980s it was a ‘ deeply sexist place ’			1
but he insisted the culture had changed and women could be successful – provided they did not have children			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ you are as valuable as the client base that sticks with you and will move with you			1
‘ in many , many cases , women make different choices in life than what men make simply for biological reasons			2
‘ and if a woman has a client base , has a child and takes two or three years off work , she is worth far less to the employer when she comes back than when she went away because her client base will not have stuck rigidly to her			1
’ mr @entity0 said there was no ‘ discrimination against women at all ’ in the @entity3 , adding : ‘ @entity135 , able women who are prepared to sacrifice the family life and stick to their career will do as well or better than men			1
' while growing numbers of men were choosing to stay - at - home to allow partners to return to work , mr @entity0 added : ‘ i have to admit i was never going to be one of them myself			0
' @entity147 deputy leader @entity146 said mr @entity0 was ‘ downright wrong ’			2
she added : ‘ there ’s not a single business or public service in this country which would still have the lights on if women were n’t there at work			2
‘ and yes , women do an important role in the home as well , not least because men do n’t share equally in the home and therefore it falls to women			2
‘ but women are vital in their work and i think that is an affront to women in this country and i just ca n’t believe that he ’s said that			2
’ @entity168 , a partner at the international law firm @entity169 , said : ‘ these remarks reflect an incredibly narrow view of worth			0
’ she added : ‘ the days when you evaluate someone ’s contribution based on their book of contacts are long gone and employers risk losing out on top talent if that is their attitude			0
’ mr @entity0 also hit back at attacks on @entity6 , after he suspended a councillor who blamed the @entity185 and @entity186 floods on @entity188 ’s decision to legalise gay marriage			1
@entity190 claimed last week that the country had been ‘ beset by storms ’ because the prime minister had acted ‘ arrogantly against the gospel ’ by passing same - sex marriage laws			1
@entity6 ’s leadership had originally refused to discipline mr @entity190 , 73 , a town councillor in @entity197 , @entity198 , saying that everyone was entitled to their religious views			1
but he was finally suspended yesterday afternoon after defying a request not to do further interviews on his beliefs			2
however , mr @entity0 today suggested that the remarks had only become a story after mr @entity190 joined @entity6 from the @entity209 party , where he had previously aired similar views			1
women who ' sacrifice ' family life can still be successful in the financial sector , mr @entity0 said speaking in a question - and - answer session in the @entity3 , the @entity6 leader said : ' i think it is very interesting that , when mr @entity190 was saying these things in 2012 and 2013 as a conservative town councillor in @entity197 , it was not a news story			1
but suddenly he switches to @entity6 and continues the same thing and gets on the national news			1
' i think that shows you and tells you all you need to know			0
the establishment , the status quo , the big businesses , the big @entity230 and our three so - called main political parties are scared witless by what @entity6 is doing because we are striking a chord not just for ordinary people but for many elements in the business community as well			1
' they will try to do whatever they can to shoot us down			0
' mr @entity190 angered party bosses by going on local radio to say that being gay was a ‘ spiritual disease ’ which can be healed .			1
