@entity11 @entity2 , who was imprisoned for 15 months for child cruelty , can stay in @entity4 after a judge ruled that her crime was not serious enough to warrant her deportation under @entity17 rules			1
in may 2010 the 30 - year - old , who was in @entity20 , locked her seven , four and two - year - old in a room while she went out for the day , with no food or water , her trial heard			1
@entity25 called the police after spotting the youngsters , who were discovered naked apart from the eldest who wore underwear , leaning out of a window			0
the @entity32 attempted to deport the mother , who no longer has any contact with her children , when she was released from prison in 2011 , the @entity31 reported			1
but the @entity17 's policy of free movement amongst member countries means that @entity40 has to be deemed a ' genuine , present and sufficiently serious threat ' to be expelled			1
upper tribunal judge @entity42 rejected the @entity32 's argument that the mother would present a risk if she became pregnant or met a partner with children , according to the @entity31			1
the free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed to @entity17 ( @entity17 ) citizens by the treaties			1
to deport someone is a very considerable interference in a person 's life and must be proportionate to the seriousness of the breach of public policy or public security , the @entity17 guidance states			1
the free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed to @entity17 citizens by the treaties the decision to expel someone must be based ' on the personal conduct of the individual concerned which must represent a genuine , present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society '			1
@entity17 citizens and their family members who have the right of permanent residence enjoy increased protection against expulsion as they can be expelled only on serious grounds of public policy or public security			2
a @entity32 spokesman was unavailable for comment when the @entity83 contacted them			0
the decision over @entity40 comes after a flurry of changes the government plans to make in relation to @entity4 's membership of the @entity17			2
at the start of july it was announced that the government plans to claw back 100 powers from the @entity17			2
the move represents the start of @entity97 's attempt to renegotiate @entity4 's relationship with @entity99 ahead of the proposed in - out referendum on the @entity17			1
but it is also a coup for home secretary @entity103 , who will announce the plans this week and is likely to receive a boost to her profile after successfully deporting hate preacher @entity109			0
there are currently 133 @entity17 regulations governing home affairs , justice and the police , including measures to set up a @entity99 dna database and impose driving bans which are valid across the continent			2
the process of opting out is governed by the controversial @entity120 , which states that member nations can exempt themselves from whole areas of @entity17 policy			2
the @entity4 government is set to examine each measure in turn to determine whether or not it is in the national interest to sign up			0
it is expected that roughly two thirds of the 133 rules will be ditched by ministers next year			0
in may the @entity134 's speech included a crackdown on immigration and an end to the farce of criminals and terrorists abusing human rights laws			0
@entity142 announced plans to stop foreign prisoners using the right to ‘ family life ’ to avoid deportation			0
the legislation will add legal weight to guidance for judges introduced last july by @entity103 that foreign criminals should be able to use @entity153 8 of the @entity154 in exceptional circumstances only			0
judges have continued to ignore the home secretary ’s guidance because it was not backed up by primary legislation			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
