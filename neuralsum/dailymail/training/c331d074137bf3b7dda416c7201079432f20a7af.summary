if you 're a family who likes to plan ahead while also enjoying your own space - this £ 20,000 holiday home could be just what you 've been looking for			0
the hidden nuclear bunker , built in 1960 during the @entity6 , was designed to withstand an atomic blast and monitor the aftermath of such an attack			1
surrounded by farmland near the village of @entity12 in @entity13 , the 20ft by 8ft underground lair is now on the market - boasting a modest bathroom and a monitoring chamber with the ability to connect to a phone line in the event of a catastrophe			1
the small space is currently uninhabited and subject to planning approval but could be put to multiple uses - including a wine cellar , a holiday home or even a doomsday storage unit			1
business development director @entity39 , 46 , who bought the bunker in 2006 after it was sold to the @entity41 in 1993 , claims the possibilities for usage are endless			0
mr @entity39 , who lives in @entity12 , just a mile from the hideaway , said : ' the bunker has got a fascinating history , with its origins dating back to the height of the @entity6			2
view of the countryside : the underground bunker , accessible only through a narrow shaft , is situated around 300 yards from the village of @entity12 in @entity13 main chamber : the monitoring room takes up most of the bunker 's space and can be connected to a phone line in the event of a disaster ' however you can date the site 's military connections even further back to 1931 when the area was used as an outpost to spot foreign military aircraft			1
' back then , it was merely an observation platform on raised stilts , and it was often still used during @entity69 for the same purpose			0
' it was n't until 1960 that this role changed when the @entity29 moved their focus towards the nuclear threat from overseas			1
' according to official @entity29 documentation , a team of three would be expected to live underground in the event of a ' nuclear incident ' , providing reports on the levels of radioactivity in the area			1
manned by members of the @entity29 , drawn mainly from the local community , it was their job to report their findings to the @entity29 headquarters in @entity90			2
however the site was decommissioned on september 30 1991 following the global nuclear de-escalation that spelled the end of the @entity6			0
mr @entity39 added : ' despite its military history , i 've actually considered converting the space into a bunker themed bed and breakfast			2
modest bathroom : the bunker , built as a military outpost by the @entity29 , also features a toilet waiting for interest : current owner @entity39 says he is yet to have any offers but believes bunkers such as these are popular with those preparing for an apocalypse ' but i 've just not had the time to commit to such a project			1
' i 've had a few offers come in for it so i 'm sure someone with the time and resources will come and put it to use ' ' i 've heard nuclear bunkers are in demand by preppers looking for a place to hole up in the event of a disaster			2
' among the 800 @entity29 nuclear bunkers were 29 sprawling stations which served as secret headquarters			1
many of these larger spaces have now been transformed into luxury properties - including a five - bedroom timber - clad eco-house in @entity132			0
the underground bunker is surrounded by farmland near the village of @entity12 in @entity13 @entity31 's secret nuclear bunkers are being put to use in all sorts of ways - from houses and vets ' surgeries to recording studios and even a laser tag arena			1
much larger than the @entity13 hideaway newly on the market , many of these sprawling hq stations were built with bedrooms , canteens , generators and decontamination rooms			2
one bunker in @entity153 , @entity154 , has been turned into a post-apocalyptic laser tag arena while another in @entity156 , @entity132 , has become a five - bedroom timber - clad eco-house - which was recently on the market for almost £ 700,000			0
nestled into the side of a hill , it was converted after years of laying derelict and being broken into by explorers and the homeless			0
the entire bunker 's ventilation system was overhauled and is now being used to make the house more energy efficient			0
secret history : @entity31 's @entity171 once held 70 volunteers each who would have helped rebuild @entity31 after a nuclear war			1
this one , nestled on a hillside in @entity156 , @entity132 , lay empty and derelict for years ( pictured ) - and has now become a five - bed eco-house bunking down : one of the former @entity156 bunker 's five bedrooms , with barely a nod to the site 's secret @entity6 past			0
it is just one bunker that has found an unusual new use - others include a recording studio , a laser tag arena , a vets ' surgery and a mock house for police training			0
more comfortable : the newly - built house offers a few more home comforts and fewer foil - packed government rations than its previous form demise : almost half of the 29 @entity29 headquarters have been demolished ( in orange ) since closing down			2
the @entity201 were part of a larger , complex network which also included 11 regional seats of government , two of which have been restored , and hundreds of tiny monitoring posts			0

@entity211 bunker was built in 1960 as military outpost in event of nuclear war
includes toilet , monitoring room and views of @entity13 's countryside
one of 800 built by @entity29 to assess atom bomb aftermath
*suggested* uses include a wine cellar or a post-apocalyptic hideaway
