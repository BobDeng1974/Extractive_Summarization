by @entity1 reporter published : 04:42 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 07:14 est , 25 september 2013 @entity4 executives have been jetting across the world in planes run on cheap fuel subsidised by @entity8 and the @entity10 @entity9 , an investigation has revealed			1
a company owned by @entity4 's founders has bought millions of dollars worth of jet fuel at below market prices from @entity8 's @entity15 at @entity16 , near @entity17 , @entity18			1
it has also emerged that keeping the planes at the federal site has enabled the owners to avoid hefty property taxes , potentially amounting to $ 500,000 per plane per year			2
' @entity25 ' : @entity4 co-founders @entity27 , left , and @entity28 , centre , and its executive chairman @entity30 , right , are the principals of @entity31 , which owns seven private jets and buys cheap fuel direct from @entity8 the investigation by @entity35 found that nearly $ 8million worth of fuel , sold for as little as $ 1.68 a gallon , has been put into a fleet of seven aircraft and two helicopters owned by @entity31			1
the same fuel sells for two to nearly five times that amount at other nearby airports in the @entity44			0
@entity31 is a limited liability company whose principals are the also the principals of @entity4 , including founders @entity28 and @entity27 , and executive chairman @entity30			2
the apparent sweetheart deal with the @entity4 men was made possible under a so - called @entity50 allowing their planes to be kept at @entity16 since 2007			2
the site happens to be less than three miles from @entity4 's global headquarters			2
@entity31 initially agreed to pay the space agency $ 113,365.74 a month in rent - a price subsequently slashed to $ 108,938.62 a month after it allowed @entity8 to borrow the planes for experiments			1
but figures seen by @entity35 in may last year showed that of the 1,039 flights to date , only 155 were used for science			0
meanwhile , the planes , which include five @entity63 , a @entity64 757 and a @entity64 767 , used below - market - rate fuel to travel to such exotic destinations as @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
keeping the jets at @entity16 also gives @entity31 a tax break			0
property kept on federal sites is exempt from the tallying for local property taxes , which means the company pays no county taxes on the aircraft kept there			0
@entity86 assessor @entity85 told @entity35 that the exemption means that local government is losing out on between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 in property taxes per plane per year			0
@entity91 at @entity16 : keeping the planes at the federal site has enabled the owners to avoid hefty property taxes , potentially amounting to $ 500,000 per plane per year , the investigation has found @entity97 , the president and chairman of @entity99 , called the arrangement ' the greatest sweetheart deal in the history of @entity8 '			1
' there ’s no reason these billionaires should be getting cheaper gas , like the @entity107 , when they ’re not doing anything for the government , ' he told @entity35			0
' this is all a ruse to have a landing strip to go party around the world at some of the nicest resorts and the nicest parties with rock stars and celebrities			0
' and it ’s all being financed by the taxpayer			0
' conveniently located : the site happens to be less than three miles from @entity4 's global headquarters a spokesman for @entity8 said the arrangement gave the agency a ' unique component of support ' for its earth science missions to measure ozone and greenhouse gases			1
@entity4 referred @entity35 's enquiries to @entity31 , whose vice president , @entity132 , said that the company pays the full retail cost for hangar space ' that includes none of the ground support typically included ' elsewhere			2
he furthermore said that , far from the taxpayer losing out , @entity8 were in fact $ 2million better off thanks to the deal			1
following enquiries from @entity35 's journalists , the @entity9 announced that the government will stop selling jet fuel to @entity31 from august 31 , 2013 .			0

investigation finds firm owned by @entity4 execs keeps jets at @entity8 *facility*
