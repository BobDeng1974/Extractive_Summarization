police are hoping that a sketch artist 's rendering will help them identify the embalmed head of a woman found in the western @entity6 woods last week			1
@entity9 police chief @entity7 told @entity10 on wednesday that the drawing is n't finished , but will be released to media outlets once it is			2
police do n't want to release a photo of the woman 's head in order to be sensitive to her family			2
the head appears to be that of woman in her late 60s or early 70s , but police have no idea where it 's from , especially since it was embalmed			1
scene : the ' bizarre ' was find was made in the woods of @entity9 in west @entity6 , however cadaver dogs that searched the area only found the head , and not a corpse ' it 's so bizarre , nobody has ever heard of anything like this , ' @entity7 said			1
that 's one reason police do n't suspect the woman was the victim of a homicide			0
help : police hope a sketch of what the woman may have looked like will help identify her but , depending on how and why the head wound up in the woods , a crime still could have been committed			0
among other things , it 's illegal to abuse a corpse in @entity6			2
' what 's bizarre is not that we 've found a head , it 's that we 've found a head that 's embalmed , ' @entity7 said			0
' that 's what 's really strange about the whole thing			0
' police are contacting medical schools to see if the head is from a cadaver , and are entering dna from the remains into a nationwide @entity63 database for missing persons			1
if police can determine the woman 's identity , that gives them a starting place to determine who would have had access to her body and when			2
the sketch has n't been completed because the artist is backlogged , but @entity7 's hoping to release it in the next few days			0
the head was found friday in @entity9 , a borough about 20 miles northwest of @entity77			1
search crews using cadaver - sniffing dogs searched the area , but found no other remains			1
@entity7 said the head appeared to be in good condition , leading police to believe it had n't been there more than a week			0
but because it was embalmed , investigators ca n't be entirely sure .			0

@entity89 was found friday in @entity9 , west @entity6
cadaver dogs searched the area but did not find a corpse
sketch artist will hopefully determine accurate image of the woman
believed to be in her 60s or 70s
police contacting locating medical schools to see if it 's a *practical* corpse
