by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 17:40 est , 20 june 2013 @entity1 arrived at @entity2 today armed with a £ 40,000 painting she was accused of stealing from her former partner @entity1 described yesterday how being locked in a police ‘ cage ’ after she was accused of theft had been her ‘ worst nightmare ’			1
prince @entity12 ’s former girlfriend was speaking after she handed back a £ 40,000 painting she was accused of snatching from @entity14			1
she had been due to stand trial for allegedly taking the artwork from the home of mr @entity14 , the father of her 16 - year - old daughter @entity18			1
but a dramatic last - minute deal between lawyers saw the 57 - year - old actress - turned - photographer cleared when she agreed to return the 17th century oil painting			1
her defence lawyer also said the expensive nature of the case had given rise to the ‘ very real risk ’ that miss @entity29 would be left homeless and unable to provide a home for her daughter			1
miss @entity29 , who was accused under her real name @entity33 , had arrived at court yesterday with the painting wrapped in a green blanket and bubble wrap			1
it was carried in a canvas shopping bag by her solicitor @entity40 who told security officials at @entity2 : ‘ be careful , it ’s very expensive			2
’ the 12in square artwork by the @entity44 master @entity43 was then examined by lawyers representing mr @entity14 in a consultation room next to the court			2
a photograph of the moonlit coastal landscape – which was still in its frame – was then sent by text message to mr @entity14 , who verified it was the one he claimed was his			2
once the handover was confirmed , prosecutors offered no evidence against @entity29 and his honour judge @entity55 recorded a formal ‘ not guilty ’ verdict			2
miss @entity29 had claimed she believed the painting belonged to her when she took it from mr @entity14 ’s home in @entity60 , @entity61 on july 21 last year			1
but she became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with mr @entity14 , an @entity63 financier who had left her ten days before their 1997 wedding while she was heavily pregnant			2
@entity63 - born miss @entity29 yesterday said the ‘ painful episode ’ , which included being locked in a police cell , was beyond her ‘ worst nightmare ’			1
in a statement she said : ‘ i have been cleared of a charge that should never have been brought against me			2
i leave court with my liberty and my good name , but it should never have come to this			0
i was a defendant charged with a serious crime			0
in my mind , i have been looking into a prison for the last ten months			0
‘ i have travelled through the criminal courts , a stranger in a strange land			1
when i was arrested i was even put into a cage – as they describe it at the police station			0
i have been vilified and put in the pillory			0
fortunately , common sense has prevailed and my former partner has relented			0
’ miss @entity29 struck a deal with prosecutors to hand back the @entity43 oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape to court to avoid trial miss @entity29 was cleared of theft by a judge at @entity2 today after the prosecution offered no evidence			1
the trial was adjourned yesterday when the judge questioned if it was in the public interest she added : ‘ if someone like me can be arrested , bruised and locked in a police cage , an experience i never dreamed would happen in my life , then it could happen to anyone			0
’ her relationship with mr @entity14 has been tempestuous since they separated in 1997 and she once threatened to sue him for ‘ emotional distress ’ after he appealed for custody of their daughter			2
miss @entity29 yesterday expressed hope that her dealings with mr @entity14 might improve			1
however , in court @entity116 , defending , claimed mr @entity14 had ‘ sought to criminalise the mother of his child unjustly , disproportionally and inappropriately ’			2
' today i have been cleared of a charge that should never have been brought against me			2
' i leave court with my liberty and my good name but it should never have come to this			0
' i was a defendant charged with a serious crime			0
in my mind , i have been looking into a prison for the last ten months			0
' i have travelled through the criminal courts , a stranger in a strange land			1
' when i was arrested i was even put into a cage - as they describe it at the police station			0
i have been vilified and put in the pillory			0
' fortunately , common sense has prevailed and my former partner has relented			0
' as @entity141 once said , " @entity139 we loved each other and were ignorant "			1
' i leave with the desire that from now on we will treat each other with respect and that any disputes we may have are dealt with in private and with dignity			0
' he also said the case had given rise to the ‘ very real risk ’ that his client would be left homeless and unable to provide a home for her daughter			0
defence counsel applied for costs to be donated to the @entity157 fund which represented miss @entity29 at court , but this was refused by the judge			1
judge @entity55 said : ‘ it is an unfortunate fact that for many years these parties have been locked in battle in the civil and family courts			0
‘ at the end of the day , the fact of the matter is if your client had acted through the civil courts , it would have been dealt with there and if she had not gone to the property and taken away the painting , this would never have happened			0
‘ if things had gone differently , we might have been here for days			0
‘ it was better to resolve this matter without running the risk of private personal matters being ventilated in court			0
’ miss @entity29 , who did not qualify for legal aid , later appealed for more support for the @entity157 fund which had helped her through ‘ this painful episode ’			1
miss @entity29 met the @entity12 on a blind date during his leave from the @entity190 and they began dating on his return from the @entity193 in 1982			1
she was later invited to @entity194 to visit the @entity195			0
the couple dated for 18 months before separating after it was revealed miss @entity29 had appeared semi-naked in the soft porn film @entity199			1
