@entity22 , 80 , was given the 48 - page pamphlet by a friend more than 50 years ago and had forgotten about it until recently after looking in his attic			1
the two - and - a - half page story , titled ' @entity1 : discovering the @entity29 and , by deduction , the @entity28 ' , is about the sleuth and @entity33 's trip to the town			1

he was prompted to write the tale after the town was struck by a great flood in 1902 and the town 's @entity41 crossing the @entity43 in the @entity44 was washed away			2
the great - grandfather from @entity16 , who found the book tied together with string , said : ' in @entity16 there was a wooden bridge that was put up some time before it was flooded in 1902			1
' the town did n't have the money to replace it so they decided to have a bazaar to replace the bridge in 1904			1
' they had various people to come and do things and just about everyone in the town did something			0
' the local mps and landowners and everyone in two days i think took in Â£ 560 , which was quite some sum then			0
the 1,300 - word tale starring the famous detective is part of a book of short stories by locals in @entity16 , @entity15 the ' @entity20 ' was given to @entity71 , 80 , by a friend but he 'd forgotten about it for half a century ' the saturday was opened by sir @entity2			1
he had written a wee story about @entity1 and @entity33 and this was in the book			1
' i ca n't remember how much they raised but they wanted it to be a carriage bridge but they did n't get quite enough for that , but they built an iron bridge and it 's still there today			2
the @entity1 tale starts with a newspaper editor dispatching a journalist to @entity90 to find ' a word from @entity1 ' and @entity33			2
the writer finds the pair and watches them in conversation - as @entity1 declares he 's going to @entity96 to solve the ' mysteries of the @entity98 '			0
he asks @entity33 if he 'd like to go with him but when @entity33 says he ca n't go @entity1 sounds surprises and says he thought he was ' going to the @entity100 '			0
@entity33 then asks him how he knows that and @entity1 , using his usual powers says it is a ' matter of deduction '			0
he says @entity33 had recently discussed politics of the north and had used a term ' huz ' which is only found in a certain area of @entity15			1
@entity1 also says he heard @entity33 ' crooning a weird song ' which he must have read or heard while previously in @entity111 , @entity15			1
he says ' later still the plot deepened ' when @entity33 began ' lilting ' another local song and then showed knowledge of @entity116 homes says the clues means @entity33 must be heading to either @entity111 , @entity119 , or @entity16			2
he says he then ' smoked a ton of tobacco ' and spent the night in thought and worked out he was heading to @entity16			0
@entity33 then admits he is indeed ' going to @entity16 in aide of a bridge ' and @entity1 wishes him well on his journey			1
' he really must have thought enough of the town to come down and take part and contribute a story to the book			2
it 's a great little story			0
' the book - around ten inches long and three inches wide with a soft brown paper cover - contained stories from local people , as well as the famous author			2
the back cover details a programme of events and proudly states ' the famous litterateur ' was due to open the day before the ladies orchestra performed and local piano recitals			0
' it was a varied book with lots of bits and pieces and stories , ' said mr @entity71 , a retired woodcutter and father - of - three			2
' i have no idea how many they made and sold			0
i 've had this book for about 40 or 50 years			1
i must have got it from a friend because i ca n't remember buying it from anyone			0
' usually people would throw out these books or sell them off			0
it has been in my family for quite a while now			0
' i have no idea if it has ever been published - i 've never seen it			0
i 've always been interested in history and my family has always passed on stories and i suppose this was one of the stories that was passed down			0
' @entity166 , a senior lecturer in @entity167 at @entity168 , said : ' this seems like a really fun piece , it 's self - parodic , makes a playful jibe against journalists , and wittily compresses @entity44 history in an affectionate tribute to @entity16 - all whilst leaving the reader wondering where both the story , and @entity33 , are heading			1
' it feels like @entity2 really enjoyed writing it			0
' sir @entity2 returned to the town a few months later with a cricket team to play @entity16			1
in 1905 he gifted a now - lost @entity185 football trophy , called the @entity186 , last won by @entity187 in 1937 - 38			0

the booklet will be on show at the @entity195 from saturday , along with mr @entity22 's painting of the replaced bridge			2
this painting shows @entity199 , before it was washed away by a great flood in 1902			0
