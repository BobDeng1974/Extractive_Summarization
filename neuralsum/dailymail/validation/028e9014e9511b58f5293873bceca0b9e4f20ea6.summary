as news of @entity3 ’s latest injury setback emerged , those four words will have swirled around @entity5 ’ mind			1
@entity8 ’s manager has become accustomed to picking teams that do not contain @entity3 — he went from august 31 to january 31 without him , remember — but , as the campaign reaches its defining moment , this is not something he will relish			1
it was bad enough to lose his captain @entity15 to a three - match suspension last sunday , and the @entity19 ’s decision to give @entity20 , @entity8 ’s best defender , the same ban for stamping on @entity22 exacerbated the problem			1
@entity3 will be out of action for around a month after picking up a hip injury the new setback is another blow in a season that has been ruined by injury for the @entity8 striker @entity3 injured his thigh on @entity33 duty last september and did n't play for @entity8 again in 2014 @entity36 goals for @entity3 since his debut in jan 2013 — from that date until he left for @entity39 last summer , former strike partner @entity34 scored 41 immediately after the international break is over , no team in the @entity36 has more at stake than @entity8 , who have a lunchtime trip to @entity45 next saturday followed by an @entity47 quarter - final replay at @entity48 four days later			1
@entity15 and @entity20 would have had big contributions to make to those fixtures and , without them , there is absolutely no doubt @entity8 ’s chances of success have been compromised			1
taking @entity3 away has an even greater impact			1
lose at the @entity57 and @entity58 and the campaign that @entity8 have fought hard to resurrect since @entity5 changed his system to 3 - 4 - 3 will effectively be over			1
that is what is on the line			0
that is why @entity5 needs @entity3 fit			1
at this point , it should be noted @entity3 has not set the world alight since he returned as a substitute against @entity70 at the end of january			2
there have been some flashes of star quality but , in a lot of games , his performances could kindly be described as ‘ enigmatic ’			2
the thing with @entity3 , however , is that he scores			2
‘ he is an absolute nightmare for a defender when he is on it , ’ @entity15 once observed			2
even when he is playing poorly — like last sunday against @entity82 — you can not discount him for a moment			0
he has poise and awareness in the penalty area and it is why @entity5 believe he can become one of @entity91 ’s top strikers			0
@entity3 scores for @entity8 in their @entity47 fifth round victory at @entity93 @entity15 was hit with a three - match ban after he was sent off against @entity82 note the words ‘ can become ’ : something is holding @entity3 back from fulfilling his potential			1
can his body stand up to the rigours of football at the highest level ? or is it more psychological than physical ? ‘ if @entity3 had @entity108 ’s mentality , he ’d be almost unstoppable , ’ @entity104 wrote in these pages during the @entity106 last summer			2
‘ @entity108 will play through the pain barrier and wo n’t let a niggle keep him out of the action			0
‘ @entity34 is another who stays away from the treatment room at all costs			0
with @entity3 , however , there was a feeling that everything had to be right for him to train or play			2
if a knock was playing on his mind , he would want it assessed to be sure he could play at the weekend			0
’ @entity3 ’s latest ailment concerns his hip			1
he damaged it against @entity82 and , after a scan at @entity123 following a recovery session on monday , it was left to @entity33 manager @entity125 to report that he has suffered ‘ a small tear ’ to his flexor muscles			0
given all that has happened this season , with his initial calf problem being sustained on september 5 , it left the 25 - year - old ‘ absolutely devastated ’ that he could not figure in the @entity134 qualifier against @entity135			0
@entity20 was handed the same ban after he stamped on @entity82 goalkeeper @entity22 the question now , however , concerns how quickly he will be able to recover			1
it has been mooted that he could be out for up to a month and while that prognosis may seem overly pessimistic , history has shown it is not prudent to give definitive timescales when @entity3 is being treated			1
you would think , then , given what is at stake , he will now be redoubling his efforts to be ready for the trip to @entity45			0
@entity5 will certainly hope so as @entity147 is the only other recognised striker to score for @entity8 since january 31			2
‘ winning games and scoring goals is the motto , ’ @entity3 posted on @entity148 last october			1
‘ do n’t think people realise how hard it is mentally being injured			0
i ’ve had a lot of time to reflect			0
ca n’t wait to be back ! ! best feeling is to be playing football and i take it for granted when you ’re fit			0
’ much to his dismay , @entity3 has had a lot of time to think this season			1
his manager will be hoping he gets a lot of time to score			0
a @entity168 place and the @entity47 are at stake .			0
