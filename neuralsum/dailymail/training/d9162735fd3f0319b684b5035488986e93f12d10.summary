by @entity0 published : 17:57 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 19:04 est , 27 march 2012 going up : @entity1 is to be given the freedom to set its own prices for first - class stamps the price of a first - class stamp will leap by a third to 60p next month			1
the 14p rise was announced by @entity1 on the very day it was handed the power to set its own stamp prices for the first time in its 172 - year history			1
a second - class stamp , currently 36p , will jump to 50p , a rise of 39 per cent			1
by comparison , most workers pay is either frozen or rising at less than 2 per cent a year			0
@entity1 will be able to continue to raise its prices as often – and by as much – as it likes after postal regulator @entity19 did away with current price controls			1
the only protection , which will last for just seven years , is a ‘ safeguard cap ’ on the price of a second - class stamp , large second - class letters and small packages weighing up to 2kg			1
@entity19 said @entity1 can not charge more than 55p for a second class stamp this year			1
this ‘ cap ’ will be increased with the cost of living each year until 2020			0
the latest price rises , which will come into effect on april 30 were widely criticised yesterday			2
the increases in the price of stamps followed a decision by regulator @entity19 to give @entity1 the freedom to set its own prices @entity38 , chief executive of the @entity39 , said : ‘ effectively , this is a licence for @entity1 to print money			1
’ he warned that a first - class stamp ‘ without limit ’ will simply become ‘ unaffordable ’ for many customers , such as small firms			2
the details of other safeguards have not been decided , and will not come into effect until april 2013			0
when the seven - year safeguard ends , there will be no caps on any of @entity1 ’s services unless @entity19 decides another cap is necessary			1
@entity1 boss @entity54 yesterday insisted she had ‘ no option ’ but to increase prices to protect the crucial ‘ universal service obligation ’			1
this is the promise to collect and deliver letters six days a week , and allow people to send a letter for the same price anywhere from the @entity64 coast to the @entity66 islands			2
@entity19 ’s 251 - page report , published yesterday , acknowledged the ‘ critical role in the cohesion of society ’ played by this ‘ fundamentally important ’ service			2
miss @entity54 refused to rule out the prospect of multiple price rises each year @entity74 , director of postal policy at @entity75 , warned of ‘ a fine line between being willing to pay more and deciding to walk away from using the postal service ’			2
@entity78 , of @entity19 , said @entity1 has been hit by people being more likely to send an email , a text message , a tweet and so on , than to post a letter			1
he said : ‘ if you are thinking about communicating with somebody ... the last thing you are going to do is to sit down and write them a letter			0
’ the @entity89 said @entity90 send more cards than anybody else in the world			0
a typical adult sends 31 each year			0
the scale of other price rises is high			0
for example , the cost of a one - month ‘ redirection ’ service , if you move house , will jump from £ 8 to £ 12.50 , a 56 per cent increase			0
the @entity104 said the price rises were the latest ploy to prepare the company for privatisation next year			0
last week , the firm ’s pension fund was handed to taxpayers , leaving them to pay £ 37.5billion of ‘ pension promises ’ to its workers , but handing over assets of only £ 28billion			0
a @entity117 spokesman said : ‘ price rises are never welcome , but ministers are clear that the top priority is to protect the universal service on which people rely			0

30 **%** and 39 **%** price rise for first and second class
@entity19 has allowed @entity1 to set its own prices
changes follow *dramatic* fall in letters posted
