@entity0 told the courtroom at her murder trial on wednesday that she enjoyed - even instigated - raunchy sex acts with her ex boyfriend before killing him , contradicting her previous accounts where she testified that he coerced her into performing for him			1
at times during the trial , she said he made her feel like a prostitute , but that was not the case today			0
under aggressive questioning by prosecutor @entity14 on wednesday , @entity12 said she was blossoming sexually and the couple 's antics were helping her grow			1
@entity14 has been working to poke holes in her stories and has noted the duplicity of her portrayal of @entity0 , trying to show jurors she is lying , as he works for a first - degree murder conviction and the death penalty			1
the image of her as an unwilling participant , however , was shattered today when phone recordings of the couple 's conversations were played for jurors and text messages shown in court seem to indicate that she enjoyed participating			2
' so when you tell us you felt like a prostitute it seems to be contradictory ? ' @entity14 noted			0
@entity12 said he is misunderstanding the context of the text messages and calls , during which one segment played for jurors has @entity12 telling @entity37 : ' you are amazing			1
seriously , you made me feel like a goddess			0
' refreshing her memory : @entity12 's lapses in memory dating back to crucial times around the murder of her boyfriend have been serious points of inquiry for prosecutor @entity14 @entity14 noted the call , which @entity12 recorded , came shortly after one of the encounters @entity12 claimed made her feel like @entity37 was using her for sex			1
' you were actually into it as much as he was , right ? ' @entity14 asked			0
' yes , ' @entity12 said			2
taking the stand : wednesday was the 12th day in a row that @entity12 has testified @entity14 then read for jurors salacious text messages between @entity12 and @entity37 , one of which has @entity12 describing how she wanted to be treated ' like a dirty little schoolgirl '			1
she previously testified that was just one of @entity37 's ' deviant ' sexual fantasies that made her uncomfortable			1
' you did enjoy dressing up though , right ? ' @entity14 asked			0
' um , yes , ' @entity12 replied			2
' it was a consensual mutual relationship sexually speaking , was n't it ? ' @entity14 prodded			0
' yes , always , ' @entity12 said			2
' no indication that you were offended ? ' the prosecutor continued			0
' correct , ' @entity12 replied			2
much of the afternoon session was dedicated to unraveling her decisions during the 48 - hours leading up to @entity37 's death			1
one decision that she remains unable to fully explain is why she bought two 5 - gallon cartons and one 2 - gallon carton of gas while in @entity113 as she prepared to drive to @entity37 's house in @entity33			1
ignoring the fact that she had 12 gallons in her trunk that remained untouched on her way to the house , she went on to stop at two other gas stations in @entity33 to fill up her tank			0
using estimates of 2008 gas prices , those moves would have left her with only a small portion of her estimated $ 200 that she thought she brought on the trip with her			0
she offered no explanation as to why she left the gas in her trunk , though the prosecution is undoubtedly trying to use it as an example of how she premeditated the murder			2
logistics of the scene : @entity12 explained - using a picture of @entity37 's bedroom - where and how she was tied up to the bed during sex and how she was a willing participant not adding up : @entity12 said that she bought 12 gallons of gas in @entity113 allegedly to save money , but then went on to refuel two other times - with one receipt shown in court above - during her drive to @entity37 's house without touching the gas she brought with her her own words : because she gave a number of media interviews while in jail , those stories are being played back for the courtroom			1
now she admits that much of what she said during those interviews were lies their other example of premeditation is the idea that @entity37 did not have a gun in his house - as @entity12 claimed he did - but that she stole the .25 caliber gun from her grandparents house a week before the killing			1
it is the same make as the gun that was used to kill @entity169 , but neither gun has ever been found			0
another weapon that was used to kill @entity37 was his kitchen knife , with which @entity12 stabbed him 27 times			1
in previous testimony , she alleged that it was in the bedroom before their supposed altercation because they had used it to cut the rope that they used to tie her up during sex			2
today she said they only used the knife in the bathroom to initially cut the rope to the size they needed for their sexual activity , but in earlier versions she said that @entity37 brought it into the bedroom to cut the rope off her when she was tied to the bed			1
@entity14 also questioned @entity12 over her repeated lies to authorities , friends and family in the days after she killed @entity37			1
she first claimed to know nothing about the killing , then later blamed it on intruders , providing descriptions of the attack by two masked people in several media interviews			0
she eventually settled on self - defense			0
she was too ashamed and frightened of the consequences to be truthful , she told jurors			0
the beginning : @entity12 looked like an entirely different person back in 2006 when she and @entity37 met @entity14 noted that even her lies were changing as she spoke to various media organizations			1
' i could n't keep my stories straight , ' @entity12 said			0
the prosecutor also noted how @entity12 has alternately described @entity37 as a cheating womanizer , an angry man with a violent temper who once choked her into unconsciousness , while simultaneously a caring , loving boyfriend			1
today marked the 12th day where @entity12 took the stand in her own defense , as she is facing the death penalty for killing @entity37 by shooting him and stabbing him 27 times inside his @entity231 , @entity33 home in june 2008			1
throughout the trial , she has claimed that she killed @entity37 in self defense as he was attacking her after she dropped his camera during a salacious nude photo shoot in his shower			0
this is not the first version of events that she has used to describe what happened to @entity37 on the night of his death			2
first she told investigators that she was not in the state , let alone his house on the night of the murder			0
later , she described an elaborate story where there was a pair of masked intruders who broke into his house and attacked them , eventually killing @entity37			0
after months of repeating this story and telling it during filmed television interviews , she now says that hew as abusive to her and she killed him in self defense .			0
