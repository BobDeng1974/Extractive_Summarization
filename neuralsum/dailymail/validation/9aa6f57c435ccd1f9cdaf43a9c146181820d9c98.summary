as the jury in the @entity4 trial reached an impasse last week , prosecutors and fellow jurors attempted to remove a holdout on the panel who was the only obstacle in the way of securing a death sentence against the convicted murderer			1
a court document released tuesday by the judge in the case reveals the behind - the - scenes wrangling in the jury room as @entity19 ' fate hung in the balance			1
jurors had questioned the holdout 's objectivity because she had previously watched a @entity26 movie about the @entity19 case , and prosecutors were upset at the juror 's social media activity as she went on @entity30 and liked several local tv stations and @entity32 of the @entity34 network			1
the juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted @entity19 to be executed for murdering boyfriend @entity4 nearly seven years ago			1
' my opinion is n't being heard , ' the judge quoted the holdout as saying			0
the holdout 's identity was leaked through a @entity68 account that also posted sympathetic comments about @entity70 , while a @entity72 website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence @entity19 to death for the 2008 killing			1
' juror safety and the protection of jurors ' personal and confidential information are topics the @entity77 takes very seriously , ' the @entity77 said in a statement released tuesday			2
@entity85 , a criminal defense attorney in @entity86 who is n't involved in the @entity19 case , said the leaks wo n't change the outcome of the case , noting that mistrial decisions ca n't be appealed			0
@entity19 was convicted of murder in @entity70 's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated			2
a new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question			0
@entity19 was charged with killing her ex-boyfriend @entity4 the one juror who voted against the death penalty admitted to seeing the @entity26 film about the case ( above ) a mistrial was declared thursday after five days of deliberations , removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for @entity19			1
the judge is scheduled to decide on april 13 whether @entity19 will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years			0
most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty			0
judge @entity45 had individually questioned some of the jurors , including the holdout , who said she was n't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial			0
@entity45 said the holdout had disclosed , before being picked as a juror , that she had seen the @entity26 movie about the @entity19 case , but never watched it all the way through			1
the judge said the holdout juror did n't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie			2
the judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her @entity30 page another film that @entity19 found influential			2
and the case 's chief investigator said the holdout , who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from @entity30 , had liked several local tv stations and @entity32 of the @entity34 network			0
the judge noted that it would take two weeks to get records from @entity30 to determine whether the holdout had clicked on news feeds on her page .			0

a court document released tuesday reveals that jurors and the prosecution in the @entity4 case wanted one juror removed from the proceedings
that juror , the lone holdout in sentencing @entity19 to death , admitted to seeing the @entity26 movie about the case
*shortly* after the jury reached an impasse , the names of all the jurors were somehow leaked and revealed online
an internal investigation has been launched to determine just how this might have happened
the holdout juror is now also being investigated for possibly reading information about the case online during the trial
