but the shocking shaggy dog story of @entity9 the @entity8 had a happy ending yesterday – after he was rescued and given a smart new haircut			1
the three - year - old dog was found abandoned and seriously neglected , with fur so overgrown and matted he could barely walk or see			1
staff at the @entity19 rehoming charity , which took in @entity9 , believe he had not been groomed for more than a year			1
@entity46 , assistant manager of the organisation ’s @entity21 centre , said : ‘ he was struggling to walk , he could hardly see and with the fur weighing as much as a bag of sugar , he was in some discomfort and under intense strain			1
’ it took two hours to shave off more than 2lb of fur , equivalent to about an eighth of @entity9 ’s body weight			0
the discarded fur formed a bundle almost as big as him when placed beside him			0
a concerned member of the public found three - year - old @entity9 in a park in @entity21 and took him in to the local @entity19			1
when staff examined the unfortunate dog , they found pieces of @entity33 and a chocolate sweet stuck in his fur			1
assistant manager @entity46 said @entity9 's 2lb burden of hair put immense strain on his body , and estimated that it had been a year since he was last groomed			0
' @entity9 was brought to us by a member of the public just over a week ago and was a very immobile dog , ' she said			2
@entity75 : @entity9 looks at the pile of shorn fur , which appears to be nearly as big as he is shorn : the breed should be thoroughly groomed every three or four months to keep them in good condition ' he was struggling to walk , he could barely see and with the fur weighing as much as a bag of sugar , he was in some discomfort and under intense strain			2
he could n't even go to the toilet			0
' he ca n't have been there long because he was dry , but it 's terrible that the past owners have left him in that state			2
it 's a very extreme case we 've had to deal with			0
' @entity9 would have been in real distress and certainly in my time here , it 's the worst case i can remember of an overgrown dog			2
' @entity99 are usually groomed every three or four months to keep their fast - growing fur in decent condition			1
pet : @entity9 has now found a new home with a loving owner who agreed to adopt the dog @entity106 : @entity9 is now back on top form after handlers helped him get over his harrowing ordeal ' @entity9 is a lovely , little active dog and is so different now than what he was like before he was shaven , ' ms @entity46 said			1
he was named @entity9 after the furry television characters who live on @entity115			0
@entity116 , manager at @entity117 , said : ' in the 27 years that i have worked here , this is the worst case of matted fur i have seen on a dog			0
' it 's astounding a dog can be left to get into this kind of condition , and then abandoned			1
with his fur trimmed , he can now feel the ground beneath his feet and the wind on his skin			0
