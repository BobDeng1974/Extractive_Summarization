by @entity0 published : 02:55 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 1 october 2013 it 's time for us to clear out our drawers : one in three @entity5 women own more than ten bras and three quarters have confessed to owning some they have n't worn for a year or more , according to a new poll			1
two thirds also admit they have n't had a proper bra fitting in a whole year , according to the @entity12 / elleuk.com poll of 2,300 women			1
but this october , @entity17 's @entity16 's @entity15 campaign is giving women the perfect excuse to get rid of those ill - fitting spare bras by appealing to the @entity21 to donate their unwanted underwear			1
the bras are collected and sent to developing countries by the charity against @entity26 , where traders support their families selling the textiles locally			2
many well known celebrities , including @entity31 , have already given away their bras to be recycled the charity has teamed up with @entity27 who help small businesses in @entity29			1
through their textile project , the company prevents valuable textiles going to landfill , giving them a new lease of life in developing countries across @entity29 , where bras remain too expensive to produce			2
@entity27 then donate a percentage of money back into @entity61 's research centre in @entity62			1
the research centre focuses on many areas of the disease including further research into early detection and diagnosis			0
fronted by @entity70 , women will be asked to take their unwanted bras along to special @entity72 at @entity74 stores			1

their results also showed half of women hoard more than 20 bras at one time			2
but a further 9 per cent admitted to keeping hold of their bras for more than 4 years			0
so it 's no surprise that 60 per cent of bra hoarders are spilling out or squeezing themselves into wrong - sized bras that are at least one cup too big or small			0
a further 8 per cent have been wearing a poorly - fitted bra for over five years .			0

three quarters of @entity5 women have n't worn some bras for a year
