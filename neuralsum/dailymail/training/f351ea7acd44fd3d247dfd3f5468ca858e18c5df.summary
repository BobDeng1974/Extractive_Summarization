this photograph is posed by a model he said : ‘ we recommended that aluminium foil should be part of legal paraphernalia			1
' @entity30 addicts and other injecting drug addicts can already obtain needles , sterile water and alcohol wipes etc legally so we ’ve suggested that foil should be added to that list			2
‘ foil can be used as a way of smoking heroin instead of injecting it and is thus considered safer , avoiding the hazards of injecting with possibly contaminated needles			2

‘ that can certainly lead to a large charge for the @entity17 and if we can find a safer way i think we should use it			2
’ a @entity49 spokesman said : ' heroin and crack cocaine are extremely harmful and cause misery to communities across the country			0
