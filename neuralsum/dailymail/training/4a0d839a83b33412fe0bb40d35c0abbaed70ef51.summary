@entity0 admits teenager @entity7 has ‘ hit the wall ’ and needs a break from the rigours of life in @entity5 ’s back line			1
@entity8 has started 23 times for club and country this season , far more than @entity0 envisaged			1
the @entity13 have lapsed occasionally into defensive chaos , summed up by sunday ’s stoppage - time equaliser at @entity16			2
per @entity17 shouldered the criticism after the 2 - 2 draw , having ducked away from the corner which was headed home by @entity22 , but the @entity5 boss backed his 6ft 6in @entity24 , accusing his team of failing to organise properly			1
@entity7 in action for @entity5 against @entity16 at @entity27 on sunday - his 23rd start of the season @entity8 faced battles against two of his @entity33 colleagues in @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 he also admitted @entity8 was feeling the strain and a rest may come during the festive fixtures , with @entity39 and @entity40 fit again			1
@entity0 said : ‘ for a 19 - year - old , he has played too many games			1
they all hit the wall after 15 - 17 games			1
you have to give them a breather			2
to have that level of responsibility in every single game is a lot at that age			0
’ the @entity5 boss preferred right back @entity39 rather than @entity8 at centre half against @entity16			1
‘ @entity39 is good in the air and at @entity57 we suffered in the air , ’ he said			0
‘ sometimes experience can make a difference and the defensive responsibility is a bit less on the flanks			0
’ @entity39 was preferred to @entity8 at centre - back , and scored a header to equalise for @entity5 @entity0 says @entity8 ( pictured in training this week ) has hit the wall after a large number of games with @entity39 and @entity70 suffering serious injuries and a shortage of cover , @entity17 has played every minute of @entity5 ’s last 23 games in the @entity75 and the @entity76			1
‘ mertesacker gives his best , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ many people had a go at him for the corner but he had no chance to get that ball in the zone where he was			0
i do n’t know why he ducked			0
maybe he sees he has n’t got the ball and somebody jumps over him and it ’s a reflex			0
‘ it is more an organisational and collective problem because nobody really talks			0
usually we ’re not bad on set - pieces			2
we have one of the best records in the league			0
maybe they do talk but it does n’t look like that when you see the pictures			0
it ’s important to have someone organising			0
’ per @entity17 received criticism after he appeared to duck out the way of @entity22 's equaliser @entity0 admits that @entity5 's back - line will be stronger when @entity70 ( centre ) returns @entity17 admitted earlier this season that he found motivation hard after the @entity112 , but @entity0 believes the 30 - year - old @entity24 , who has since retired from international football , has improved			1
‘ it has not been easy for him , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he had a difficult start to the season but he ’s been much sharper			2
i believe he ’s on the way up			0
when @entity70 comes back , we will be more stable			1
‘ even in midfield we need to get players back and to defend better			0
@entity123 is missed because he ’s a better ball - winner than people think			2
