researchers in the @entity2 found a protein produced by the gene could be synthesised and used to fight the condition			1
the study , funded by the @entity2 - based @entity16 , found the protein called klotho boosts brain skills such as thinking , learning and memory			1
it is believed it could increase the strength of connections between nerve cells in the brain			2
@entity26 , professor of neurodegeneration at @entity28 , the lead author , said : ' this could be a major step towards helping millions around the world who are suffering from alzheimer 's disease and other dementias			0
' if we could boost the brain 's ability to function , we may be able to counter dementias			2
' researchers found the protein could raise iq by up to six points - whatever the age of the person taking it - raising the possibility that a drug could become available to make people cleverer			1
' our results suggest klotho may increase the brain 's capacity to perform everyday intellectual tasks , ' said coauthor @entity55 , professor of neuroscience at the @entity28			1
people who have one copy of a variant , or form , of the kloto gene , called @entity61 , tend to live longer and have lower chances of suffering a stroke whereas people who have two copies may live shorter lives and have a higher risk of stroke			2
in the study , researchers found that people who had one copy of the @entity61 variant performed better on a battery of cognitive tests than subjects who did not have it , regardless of age , sex or the presence of the apolipoprotein 4 gene , the main genetic risk factor for @entity84 's disease			1
the investigators tested a variety of cognitive skills , including learning , memory , and attention			0
more than 700 subjects , 52 to 85 years old were tested as part of three studies			0
none had any sign of dementia			0
consistent with previous studies , 20 to 25 per cent of the subjects had one copy of the @entity99 variant and performed better on the tests than those who had no copies			0
performance on the tests decreased with age regardless of whether a subject had one or no copies of the @entity61 gene variant			0
as part of the study , researchers genetically engineered mice to overproduce klotho protein the klotho gene provides the blueprint for a protein made primarily by the cells of the kidney , placenta , small intestine , and prostate			1
a shortened version of the protein can circulate through the blood system			0
blood tests showed that subjects who had one copy of the @entity99 variant also had higher levels of circulating klotho protein			2
the levels decreased with age as others have observed			0
the researchers speculate that the age - related decrease in circulating levels of klotho protein may have caused some of the decline in performance on the cognitive tests			1
researchers then genetically engineered mice to overproduce klotho protein			1
the klotho - enhanced mice lived longer and had higher levels of klotho in the blood and in a brain area known as the hippocampus , which controls some types of learning and memory			2
similar to human studies , the klotho - enhanced mice performed better on a variety of learning and memory tests , regardless of age .			0

@entity2 study found the protein called klotho boosts brain skills
researchers found protein could raise iq by up to six points
it also raised possibility that a ' smart ' drug could become available
