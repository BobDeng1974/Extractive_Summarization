with the shutdown in its fifth day , the @entity2 - run @entity0 passed a bill today that would make sure the 800,000 sidelined government workers get paid for staying off the job			1
the measure comes with one caveat : the furloughed employees will get reimbursed for lost pay only once the government reopens			1
the @entity0 backs the bill and the @entity12 was expected to approve it , too , but the timing was unclear			2
@entity14 move : democrats and @entity2 in the @entity0 voted 407 - 0 to make sure federal workers are reimbursed for lost pay during the shutdown the 407 - 0 vote in the @entity0 was uniquely bipartisan , even as lawmakers continued their partisan rhetoric			1
‘ this is not their fault and they should not suffer as a result , ’ rep. @entity22 , a @entity23 from @entity24 , said of federal workers			2
‘ this bill is the least we should do			0
‘ our hard - working public servants should not become collateral damage in the political games and ideological wars that @entity2 are waging			0
’ @entity2 rep. @entity36 , of @entity37 , said federal workers should n't have to worry about paying their bills while @entity40 and the @entity0 fight over funding the government			1
‘ they have child care expenses , house payments to make , kids that are in college , and while the president refuses to negotiate , while he 's playing politics , they should n't worry about whether or not they can make ends meet , ’ @entity36 said			0
warring factions : @entity53 @entity0 majority leader @entity52 ( left ) and @entity55 @entity54 ( right ) speaks after the passage of the bipartisan bill @entity58 : @entity53 house speaker @entity59 ( center ) , @entity2 of @entity37 , and representative @entity61 ( 2nd l ) walk through @entity63 as the @entity0 votes on a bill to ensure back pay for furloughed workers but even as @entity40 and the @entity0 rallied around the bill , one outside group said it ‘ demonstrates the stupidity of the shutdown			1
’ making the shutdown less painful for 800,000 federal employees will encourage @entity40 and the @entity0 to extend it even longer , driving up the cost , said @entity73 of @entity74			1
@entity73 said ‘ essential ’ federal workers who stayed on the job ‘ will feel like suckers because they 've been working while the others essentially are getting paid vacations			0
’ adamant : president @entity81 said friday he wo n't negotiate on the temporary spending bill or upcoming debt limit measure the @entity0 has opposed other piecemeal efforts by @entity85 to restore money to some functions of government during the partial shutdown			1
@entity0 officials have said the @entity0 should reopen the entire government and not pick agencies and programs over others			1
in the 1995 - 96 government shutdowns , furloughed workers were retroactively given full pay			1
despite the @entity0 's declared appreciation of the essential the role of federal workers , there appeared no sign of a breakthrough in getting them back to work			1
lawmakers keep replaying the same script on @entity107 : @entity0 @entity2 pass piecemeal bills to reopen popular and politically sensitive programs , while @entity110 insist that the @entity0 vote on a straightforward @entity12 - passed measure to reopen all of government			1
‘ we know that there are enough members in the @entity115 - @entity110 and @entity2 - who are prepared to vote to reopen the government , ' @entity81 said friday			2
‘ the only thing that is keeping that from happening is speaker @entity59 has made a decision that he is going to hold out to see if he can get additional concessions from us			0
’ there seemed little chance of that			0
for one thing , flinching by either side on the shutdown might be seen as weakening one 's hand in an even more important fight looming just over the horizon as the combatants in @entity132 increasingly shifted their focus to a midmonth deadline for averting a first - ever default			0
‘ this is n't some damn game , ’ @entity59 , @entity136 , said as the @entity0 and @entity110 held to their position of agreeing to negotiate only after the government is reopened and the $ 16.7 trillion debt limit raised			1
republicans pointed to a quote in @entity144 from an anonymous @entity0 official that ‘ we are winning ... it does n't really matter to us ’ how long the shutdown lasts			2
outspoken : @entity147 , left , and @entity148 , right , join others as they hold a rally in support of federal workers outside the office of sen. @entity154 in @entity155 thursday at issue in the shutdown is a temporary funding measure to keep the government fully open through mid-november or mid-december			2
more than 100 stopgap continuing resolutions have passed without much difficulty since the last shutdown in 1996			0
but tea party @entity2 , their urgency intensified by the rollout of health insurance marketplaces this month , are demanding concessions in @entity81 's health care law as their price for the funding legislation , sparking the shutdown impasse with @entity110			0
mr @entity81 has said he wo n't negotiate on the temporary spending bill or upcoming debt limit measure , arguing they should be sent to him free of @entity2 add - ons			0
@entity40 , whether controlled by @entity110 or @entity2 , routinely sent @entity81 's predecessor , @entity175 , ‘ clean ’ stopgap spending bills and debt - limit increases			0
@entity0 @entity2 appeared to be shifting their demands , de-emphasizing their previous insistence on defunding the health care overhaul in exchange for re-opening the government			2
instead , they ramped up calls for cuts in federal benefit programs and future deficits , items that @entity59 has said repeatedly will be part of any talks on debt limit legislation .			0

@entity0 voted 407 - 0 to reimburse 800,000 government employees sidelined by impasse
in the 1995 - 96 government shutdowns , furloughed workers were retroactively given full pay
