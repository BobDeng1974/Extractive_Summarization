serious errors in the handling of the @entity3 shooting have been exposed by the grand jury files on the case , including @entity7 's gun not being tested for fingerprints â€“ and the officer washing blood off his hands			1
a 12 - person jury , after hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses , ruled that officer @entity7 will not have to stand trial over the fatal shooting of 18 - year - old @entity3 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
however , in the thousands of pages of evidence released to the public afterwards were glaring examples of crime scene protocol not being followed			1
a 12 - person jury , after hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses , ruled that officer @entity7 will not have to stand trial over the fatal shooting of 18 - year - old @entity3 one of officer @entity7 's key lines of defence was that @entity3 made him fear he was going to be shot because he tried to grab his gun while in his car			1
but @entity7 placed the gun in an evidence bag himself and the weapon was not tested for fingerprints because , an investigator argued , ' he never lost control of his gun ' , @entity30 reported			1
@entity7 was also allowed to drive himself away from the crime scene and wash blood off his hands , actions that are extremely unorthodox according to experts and government rules			1
@entity43 , an expert on police shootings with the @entity45 at @entity46 , told the @entity47 : ' an officer driving himself back ? wrong			0
an officer booking his own gun into evidence ? wrong			2
the appropriate investigative procedures were not followed			0
' and a 2013 @entity54 manual on processing crime scenes makes the procedure for dealing with blood extremely clear : ' do not allow suspect to use bathroom facilities , or to alter his / her appearance , including brushing hair or washing hands			1
' there were numerous other possible breaches in protocol that the jury hearing highlighted			2
the first officer to interview @entity7 after the shooting did n't record the conversation or take notes as he had ' multiple things going through my head besides what @entity7 was telling me '			1
the jury also heard how a medical legal examiner who analysed the crime scene did n't take any measurements because ' somebody shot somebody ' , which was ' self - explanatory '			1
these issues might all have been used by prosecutors against @entity7 had the case gone to trial			2
@entity7 ( pictured ) placed the gun he shot @entity3 with in an evidence bag himself and the weapon was not tested for fingerprints the grand jury papers also underscored inconsistencies in witness statements			1
some witnesses said @entity3 had been shot in the back			2
another said he was face - down on the ground when officer @entity7 ' finished him off			1
' still others acknowledged changing their stories to fit published details about the autopsy or admitted that they did not see the shooting at all			0
an @entity104 review of thousands of pages of grand jury documents reveals numerous examples of statements made during the shooting investigation that were inconsistent , fabricated or provably wrong			2
for one , the autopsies ultimately showed @entity3 was not struck by any bullets in his back			0
prosecutors exposed these inconsistencies before the jurors , which likely influenced their decision not to indict @entity7 in @entity3 's death			1
@entity7 was also allowed to drive himself away from the crime scene @entity120 , the @entity121 prosecutor , said the grand jury had to weigh testimony that conflicted with physical evidence and conflicting statements by witnesses as it decided whether @entity7 should face charges			1
' many witnesses to the shooting of @entity3 made statements inconsistent with other statements they made and also conflicting with the physical evidence			1
some were completely refuted by the physical evidence , ' @entity120 said			0
the decision monday not to charge @entity7 with any crime set off more violent protests in the @entity46 suburb of @entity16 and around the country , fueled by claims that the unarmed black 18 - year - old was shot while surrendering to the white officer in the mostly @entity142 city			1
what people thought were facts about the august 9 shooting have become intertwined with what many see as abuses of power and racial inequality in @entity151			0
an @entity104 review of thousands of pages of grand jury documents reveals numerous examples of statements made during the shooting investigation that were inconsistent			2
pictured is the inside of officer @entity7 's car following the shooting and media coverage of the shooting 's aftermath made it into the grand jury proceedings			1
before some witnesses testified , prosecutors showed jurors clips of the same people making statements on tv			0
their inconsistencies began almost immediately after the shooting , from people in the neighborhood , the friend walking with @entity3 during the encounter and even one woman who authorities suggested probably was n't even at the scene at the time			1
jurors also were presented with dueling versions from @entity7 and @entity184 , who was walking with @entity3 during the august 9 confrontation			1
@entity184 painted @entity7 as provoking the violence , while @entity7 said @entity3 was the aggressor			2
the decision not to charge @entity7 with any crime set off more violent protests in the @entity46 suburb of @entity16 but @entity184 also declared on tv , in a clip played for the grand jury , that @entity7 fired at least one shot at his friend while @entity3 was running away : ' it struck my friend in the back			1
' @entity184 held to a variation of this description in his grand jury testimony , saying the shot caused @entity3 's body to ' do like a jerking movement , not to where it looked like he got hit in his back , but i knew , it maybe could have grazed him , but he definitely made a jerking movement			2
' other eyewitness accounts also were clearly wrong			0
one woman , who said she was smoking a cigarette with a friend nearby , claimed she saw a second police officer in the passenger seat of @entity7 's vehicle			2
when quizzed by a prosecutor , she elaborated : the officer was white , ' middle age or young ' and in uniform			0
she said she was positive there was a second officer - even though there was not			0
another woman testified that she saw @entity3 leaning through the officer 's window ' from his navel up , ' with his hand moving up and down , as if he were punching the officer			2
but when the same witness returned to testify again on another day , she said she suffers from mental disorder , has racist views and that she has trouble distinguishing the truth from things she had read online			0
prosecutors suggested the woman had fabricated the entire incident and was not even at the scene the day of the shooting			0
another witness had told the @entity242 that @entity7 shot @entity3 in the back and then ' stood over him and finished him off			2
' but in his grand jury testimony , this witness acknowledged that he had not seen that part of the shooting , and that what he told the @entity242 was ' based on me being where i 'm from , and that can be the only assumption that i have			0
' the witness , who lives in the predominantly black neighborhood where @entity3 was killed , also acknowledged that he changed his story to fit details of the autopsy that he had learned about on tv			0
' so it was after you learned that the things you said you saw could n't have happened that way , then you changed your story about what you seen ? ' a prosecutor asserted			0
' yeah , to coincide with what really happened , ' the witness replied			0
another man , describing himself as a friend of @entity3 's , told a federal investigator that he heard the first gunshot , looked out his window and saw an officer with a gun drawn and @entity271 ' on his knees with his hands in the air			1
' he added : ' i seen him shoot him in the head			0
' but when later pressed by the investigator , the friend said he had not seen the actual shooting because he was walking down the stairs at the time and instead had heard details from someone in the apartment complex			0
' what you are saying you saw is n't forensically possible based on the evidence , ' the investigator told the friend			0
shortly after that , the friend asked if he could leave			0
' i ai n't feeling comfortable , ' he said .			0
