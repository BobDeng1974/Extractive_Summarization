adrift in the @entity1 , closer to @entity2 than @entity3 and home to its own language , @entity0 is perhaps one of the most mysterious corners of the @entity8			1
measuring just 24 sq miles , this tiny @entity8 outpost , officially @entity2 - speaking until 1948 , also braved invasion by the @entity11 in @entity12			1
this year sees the 70th anniversary of the island ’s liberation			2

but @entity0 does n’t just look backwards			1
among the @entity41 , tea rooms and crab sandwiches served up at windswept coastal spots , there are some exciting new developments			2
checking into the four - star @entity44 is about as far from quaint as @entity0 gets			1
you could almost be in @entity48			2

visit visitchannelislands.com boutique , boisterous and beautiful , this revamped hotel welcomes guests with a sleek monochrome foyer filled with quirky adornments , from a suit of armour to a dramatic black chandelier			2
a sumptuous afternoon tea display stands , tempting me to stay in and indulge in cakes and sandwiches from stylish leopard print plates			2
for those who want to indulge , you can walk straight into the moody , low - lit bar , where beige and black striped chairs and huge high - backed leopard print seats are scattered around glass tables and cocktails are the order of the day			0
upstairs , the rooms are just as quirky , but with a little less leopard print			0
@entity110 , reds , dark greens and blues are the themes of the rooms , with striped wallpaper , patterned carpets and big cushioned beds			0
they are opulent retreats , with chandeliers , artfully - designed mirrors and sleek bathrooms – exactly what you need after a day of fresh air and coastal walks			0
perched on a hill above @entity129 , the hotel sits at the corner of @entity131 , where a statue of @entity133 watches over the locals			0
the writer spent 15 years in exile on the island , 14 of which he lived at the elegant white - washed @entity139 in the capital , penning his masterpieces			2
from leopard to stripes , careful thought has gone into the clashing prints which dominate the communal areas in the hotel and on warm sunny days , guests can take the plunge in the pool , which feel like it belongs in the @entity152 more than the channel you can visit today and learn more about the genius behind @entity156 , where ornate rooms decorated in rich reds and golden trim seem to contrast with the simple beauty outside the building			0
but beyond literary greats , the island has plenty more to offer			2
i am lucky enough to happen upon golden sunshine and warm temperatures , with just a blustery breeze to blow away the cobwebs			0
it is the perfect weather to explore the coastline , from sweeping sandy beaches to craggy cliffs and everything in between			0
you can walk the whole circumference of @entity0 and each year outdoors - lovers take part in hosted @entity178 walks			1
walking along @entity0 's coastline , its tempestuous history as an island much fought - over is hard to ignore thanks to its stark defences that still stand proud looking out to sea i ’m more interested in the @entity186 designed by the tourist board to combine interesting routes with great local spots for good food			1
i eschew pub snacks in favour of a slice of gâche – @entity0 - style fruit bread – to keep me going as i stroll out and around @entity196 , the southeastern tip of the island			1

you ca n't wander far in @entity0 without stumbling across its war defences			1
the island suffered during @entity12			1
it was attacked by air , with the first raid on june 28 , 1940 killing 33 islanders and injuring a further 67			0
thankfully , around 4,000 people - mainly children - had been evacuated in the months before the attack			0
the @entity70 @entity221 began two days later , on june 30 , and lasted for almost five years later , when the island was finally liberated on may 9			1
bulky concrete blocks , built as observation points on the tops of cliffs , and bunkers built into the ground , still stand today - a stark reminder of the suffering of islanders			0
it gives the feeling of @entity0 constantly on the lookout for where the next enemy will come from			1
of course , not all defences are from the @entity12 , the island has its fair share of forts , towers and watch - houses dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries , a reminder of @entity245 's very strategic position in the @entity1 between old enemies @entity2 and @entity83			1
but it 's not all memories of war			0
@entity252 villages look like they have stepped straight out of story books , church spires stand out against rolling hills and in spring time wildflowers turn the land into a kaleidoscope of different colours			0
@entity133 spent 14 years living at @entity139 in @entity129 whilst penning his masterpieces drive along the narrow roads and you 'll happen upon ' hedge veg ' all over the place - old bookshelves or tables set up with local produce and honesty boxes			0
it certainly beats going to the supermarket			0
and after a day of bright sunshine and crisp temperatures , it seems the perfect time to retreat back to my sumptuous lodgings for a warming meal			0
a glorious roast dinner is served up on sundays at the @entity44 , in a black and white tiled conservatory filled with light and looking over a deep blue pool , which must see a lot of use in the summer months			0
the hotel manager , @entity281 , a charming man who has lived on the island for nearly thirty years , knows everything and everyone you need in @entity0			1
he pops from table to table as we tuck into our glorious roast , surrounded by families , romantic couples and even a tour group of @entity293			0
@entity281 may not have been born in @entity0 but he seems an islander through and through - immensely proud , devastatingly charming , with one foot in the past and bright ideas for the future .			1
