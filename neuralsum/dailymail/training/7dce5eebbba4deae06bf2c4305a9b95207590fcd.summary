but recorder @entity29 dismissed the appeal , telling the boy his crime as ' so terrible and so cruel that what you did is more important than the remorse you have since shown and the alternative which is put before the court			2
' mr @entity39 said the court did not think magistrates were wrong to impose the sentence they did			2
' while we accept you have shown remorse for your behaviour in the letter you have written to us and in the reports on you we have no doubt the sentence was justified			2
' @entity51 , prosecuting , said ms @entity11 left her home in @entity24 , @entity13 , on december 22 to go to stay with her mother in @entity54 for @entity55			1

' she said she was distressed by the thought ' that somebody could violate me			0
' ' i live with a disability , cerebral palsy , which is a challenge			1
to think that someone could or would do this to me makes you question yourself , ' she said			0
she said she had started questioning the people 's nature following the incident , and that it has made her look over her shoulder			2
@entity138 , defending , conceded that it was ' difficult to imagine an additional aggravating feature that might have occurred ' but submitted that the boy had already had a ' salutary lesson ' from spending the last five weeks in custody and would now benefit from supervision to try to correct his attitude and behavour .			0
