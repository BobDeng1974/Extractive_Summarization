' the questions put to me concerned the public perception of firearm officers , and references were made to our bad reputation			0
' in my opinion , it was based around @entity107			0
i felt i had been singled out and chosen to represent diversity and to change the public image of white police shooting black youth			0
' the officer later found out that she had been singled out due to her colour , the tribunal heard , leaving her feeling ' betrayed ' and ' used as a token '			0

' he has robbed me of the chance to fulfill my aspirations of working as an afo ... by doing nothing , the @entity10 have encouraged @entity17 's ill - treatment and allowed it to continue			2

' the @entity10 have encouraged him to single me out , bully me , allow him to act in an aggressive manor towards me on one occasion when he was carrying his gun			0
' she added : ' i believe the reasons for my malicious , unethical treatment at the hands of @entity17 is a direct result of discrimination based on my race , sex and my looks , @entity17 's attraction towards me and my disinterest			2
