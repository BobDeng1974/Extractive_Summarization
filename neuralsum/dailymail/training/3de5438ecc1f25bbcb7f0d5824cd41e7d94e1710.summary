by @entity0 published : 18:59 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 18:59 est , 28 may 2012 in the running : @entity2 confirmed his candidacy for the @entity5 job after months of speculation @entity7 boss @entity2 has applied to be the next director general of the @entity5 and has already stepped aside from any work related to the broadcaster , it was confirmed yesterday			1
the head of the @entity14 media regulator issued a statement confirming his candidacy after months of speculation that he wanted to take over from @entity19 , who is stepping down after the @entity20			1
the confirmation from the regulator came after a report at the weekend which saw two senior mps raising concerns about a potential conflict of interest caused by his bid for the new job			2
it was pointed out that over the past six months he has been overseeing an inquiry at @entity7 which is looking at whether the @entity5 should be included in a new way of defining media ‘ plurality ’			2
this could see @entity7 considering whether the @entity5 ’s share of the market should be limited in a similar way that private companies in the media are			2
a statement put out by the regulator yesterday admitted he had applied for the role , but claimed ‘ robust procedures ’ had been put in place to ‘ prevent any potential conflict of interest ’			2
it said mr @entity2 had already ‘ stepped aside ’ from any matters where the @entity5 might have an interest , this is said to include board meetings , executive meetings and policy discussions ‘ both formal and informal ’			1
odds on mr @entity2 have narrowed considerably in recent weeks and he is now regarded by many as the favourite for the job			1
however any appointment would be likely to be controversial given his @entity64 links and also because , as head of the media regulator , he is privy to sensitive information about commercial broadcasters such as @entity70 and @entity71			0
he could be forced to take a lengthy period of gardening leave before he joined the @entity5			0
@entity19 is stepping down as @entity5 director general after the @entity20 other names vying for the top job at the @entity5 are the corporation ’s tv boss @entity77 , its chief operating officer @entity79 , @entity5 news chief @entity80 and director of audio and music @entity82			1
mr @entity2 , whose total pay is just over £ 381,000 , is currently in control of 750 staff , whereas at the @entity5 he would be in charge of about 20,000 people			1
but because of his salary he would not be put off by the fact that the new director general will be on considerably less than mr @entity19 ’s most recent total pay figure was £ 671,000			1
initial interviews are expected to take place in the next couple of weeks , before this is whittled down to three or four candidates who will go through final interviews after that			0
@entity99 , chairman of the @entity100 , will lead the team that make the final decision on the appointment			0
there are rumours that he would favour an external candidate , but mr @entity2 remains the only confirmed candidate to come from outside the @entity5			1
the @entity7 boss has been involved in @entity14 media policy for many years			0
he served as @entity111 ’s policy advisor at @entity112 and was involved in the drafting of the @entity114 which created media regulator @entity7 before he joined the organisation as a senior partner			0
he became chief operating officer then and then replaced @entity119 as chief executive in 2006			0
the media executive can boast experience of having worked for the @entity5			0
he served there under former director general @entity124 in the role of controller of corporate strategy			1
@entity7 ’s statement yesterday read : ‘ given the significant level of speculation surrounding potential applicants for the @entity5 director general role , @entity7 can confirm that ceo @entity2 has applied			1
‘ robust procedures , agreed by the @entity7 chairman and the @entity136 , have been put in place to prevent any potential conflict of interest			0
‘ @entity2 has already stepped aside from all discussions and communication at all levels on matters where the @entity5 may have an interest			2
this includes @entity136 meetings , executive meetings and policy discussions , both formal and informal			0
