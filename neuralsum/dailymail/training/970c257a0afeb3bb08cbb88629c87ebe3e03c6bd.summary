by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 26 august 2013 one in three care home businesses is at risk of going bust due to ‘ off - the - scale ’ levels of borrowing , according to research published today			1
an examination of the accounts of nearly 5,000 companies , responsible for 20,000 care homes across the @entity12 , will ring alarm bells following the collapse of @entity15			1
formerly the largest operator in the sector , @entity15 went under in 2011 when it was unable to pay a £ 250million rent bill , bringing misery and anxiety to more than 30,000 elderly residents and their families			1
at risk : borrowing at thousands of care home operators in @entity12 is ' off the scale ' the report , compiled by @entity28 – a specialist in assessing the financial strength of firms – suggests that hundreds of smaller operators are at similar risk			1
of the firms it surveyed , 1,449 were placed in its ‘ @entity35 ’ after being considered ‘ financially vulnerable ’ and at high risk of going under			1
the research also found that almost 700 care home companies are ‘ zombie ’ businesses , with liabilities worth more than their assets			1
their combined negative net worth came in at £ 217million			2
the investigation found that the average care home has ‘ unusually high ’ gearing levels at 82 per cent			1
gearing measures debt as a proportion of a company ’s net assets			2
@entity53 , an insolvency specialist who conducted the research , said he decided to investigate the finances of the industry in the wake of the @entity15 collapse			1
‘ i wanted to see whether it was an exceptional case of corporate vanity and too much borrowing , or whether it was typical of the entire sector , ’ he said			0
he said the high level of debt in the sector , which is dominated by small companies running one or two care homes , will put many firms at risk when interest rates rise			1
‘ the aspect i find most worrying is the gearing figure of 82 per cent , ’ he said			0
‘ that is off the scale in terms of normal accounting conventions			0
most companies would not be happy with a gearing level of above 60 to 65 per cent			2
‘ the worrying thing is that we are five years into a regime with an exceptionally low level of interest rates			0
‘ what is going to happen to this sector when , not if , there is an increase in interest rates ? ’ vulnerable : 85 - year - old @entity91 was a resident at a @entity92 and had to move the report assessed companies using a points system with a maximum score of 100			2
it found that 1,449 care home businesses had a health rating of 25 points or less , putting them in the ‘ @entity35 ’ , which experience suggests gives them a one in four chance of needing a financial rescue			1
mr @entity53 said many homes have run into dire financial straits after being hit by a ‘ triple whammy ’			0
‘ they are overborrowed , they lack income because there has been pressure on local authority budgets , which means they can not increase the fees they charge , and regulation has increased their costs , ’ he said			0
‘ the profitability of care homes is being relentlessly squeezed and this is something the government has to face up to			2
either we believe as a society in providing care for the elderly or we do n’t			2
’ he said that on the positive side , although ‘ an exceptional number of care homes are financially vulnerable ’ the banks that have lent the money ‘ will do anything to avoid the potential negative publicity ’ from calling in the loans			0
@entity135 , a leading campaigner for the elderly and former government adviser on retirement , said the problem of debt was ‘ rife ’ across the whole care sector			0
‘ it is deeply worrying that the most vulnerable members of our society may be being cared for by companies that are themselves financially vulnerable , ’ she said			0
‘ the consequences of failure in this sector go far beyond finance			0
’ under plans unveiled earlier this year , the @entity151 is to start making checks on the finances of care homes .			0

1,449 care home businesses are at high risk of going under
@entity15 , the largest operator , went bust in 2011
700 companies have liabilities worth more than their assets
