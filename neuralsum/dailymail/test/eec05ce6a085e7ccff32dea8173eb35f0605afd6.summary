as @entity1 fired home his 19th @entity3 goal of the season on tuesday night , there was one question on everybody ’s lips : can he make the grade at @entity9 next season ? the 21 - year - old striker has been prolific in his loan spells at @entity3 , @entity13 and @entity14 , so much so that @entity15 understands his parent club are opening talks with him over a new deal			1
needless to say it would see his wages rise from his current £ 7,500 - a - week deal			2
he will also be given the chance to impress @entity24 on @entity9 ’s summer tour although at the end of it he is expected to go out on loan again			1
this time , though , @entity1 will be sent to a @entity30 club , preferably @entity31 ’s @entity3 should they join the @entity32 in the top flight			1
but @entity1 is a confident young man and will believe he can emulate @entity57 ’s @entity56 and force @entity9 ’s hand			1
@entity1 is currently one of 26 players out on loan from @entity61 - five of which are rival frontmen - while academy forwards @entity65 and @entity66 have already won elevation to the senior set - up			1
then there are @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 already competing for that sole striking role			0
the chances of @entity1 making his mark next season , you feel , are slim			1
but then were n’t the chances of @entity56 scoring 29 goals for @entity57 in his breakthrough season and then netting on his full @entity82 debut also outlandish ? @entity1 has already impressed @entity24 with his attitude			1
the striker was sat with his dad and @entity9 ’s technical director two years ago when the manager walked in and boldly demanded of the youngster , ‘ what do you want ? ’ he was encouraged by the reply			2
‘ to play for @entity9 , ’ returned the well - mannered but equally brazen rookie			1
@entity9 boss @entity24 ( right ) has been impressed with @entity1 's attitude as well as his development @entity54 ( pictured in 2011 ) was sold to @entity55 in the summer after failing to make the grade @entity9 youth product @entity65 ( centre ) has won elevation to the first - team squad this season @entity57 striker @entity56 ( left ) has scored 29 goals in his breakthrough season for the club @entity1 has always achieved his goals in life - be it straight a grades at @entity107 , teaching himself @entity108 and to play guitar or , indeed , scoring goals as a footballer			1
he left @entity24 in no doubt as to his ultimate ambition			0
last summer , when @entity24 convinced @entity1 that @entity3 was the best place for him , the manager dispensed with his cool exterior and hugged his player			1
‘ he was very emotional , ’ recalls the 21 - year - old			1
and there is the ace which @entity1 holds - @entity24 likes him			2
in june he will line up alongside @entity57 ’ @entity56 for @entity82 at the @entity122			0
@entity56 is just six weeks older and has plotted a similar path through the @entity124			0
on tuesday night he became @entity3 ’s first player since 1990 to score 17 league goals in one season			1
the play - offs are @entity3 ’s most likely destination			2
but for @entity134 - favourite to land the @entity124 ’s @entity136 prize - the chance of a showcase match at @entity132 is no bad thing			0
asked to detail the aspects of his game which have improved this season , @entity1 said : ‘ i now know how to use my strength in that position ( lone striker ) , and i can run a lot more			2
’ if @entity24 was listening it would have been music to his ears			0
for @entity1 ’s ability - the raw talent which persuaded @entity9 to prise him from @entity149 as an 18 - year - old after only 12 minutes of first - team football - has never been in question			1
that much was in evidence during the midweek win over @entity39			2
his goal was a ruthless combination of technique and instinct			0
at times he reminds you of a young @entity160 , but with more pace			0
but more eye - catching was the selfless pursuit of a hopeful punt forward when , after out - muscling and out - pacing his minders , he squared for a team - mate to score			0
there is , then , graft as well as craft			0
but it is @entity1 ’s personality which is most endearing			2
@entity1 scored in @entity3 's surprise @entity175 fourth round win at @entity176 on january 24 the striker 's style of play has been compared to @entity180 and @entity57 forward @entity160 ( left ) after training every day he goes home and practises guitar for ‘ one hour only ’ because he does n’t want to ‘ p * * * off the neighbours ’			1
he already plays piano , violin and saxophone and is conversational in @entity189 as well as @entity190			0
there was an offer from @entity193 to study economics , and he could even have followed his two sisters down a medicine and science route			0
he shunned all of that , however , for a career in football			0
@entity1 knows what he wants , and so does @entity24			0
he feels he is ready to make the grade at @entity9			0
to do that , like @entity56 , he first needs the chance			0
@entity1 enjoyed two loan spells at @entity14 before spending the second half of last season at @entity13			1

@entity3 beat @entity39 2 - 1 in the @entity38 on tuesday night
@entity1 scored his 19th goal of the season for @entity3 in the win
@entity1 is one of 26 players out on loan from @entity9 this season
21 - year - old has opened contract talks with the @entity32 over a new deal
