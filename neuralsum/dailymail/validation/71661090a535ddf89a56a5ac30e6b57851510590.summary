the wonderful @entity0 has two huge gaps between the seats and the roof behind each goal			0
@entity5 have learned that it is useless to try and keep prying eyes out			1
every summer , as the transfer window opens , the dragon 's lair is raided			2
giants from all over @entity12 come ashore at this @entity14 port with their treasure chests of booty , eager to snatch the latest talent off the conveyor belt			0
@entity19 produced an outrageous back heel flick to set up @entity21 's first for @entity5 the @entity22 's audacious assist set @entity5 on course for a comfortable 3 - 0 win over @entity25 the result closes the gap between @entity5 and current leaders @entity29 to just four points @entity21 , celebrates the first goal of his hat - trick to fire @entity5 to a 3 - 0 victory over rivals @entity25 @entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity34 ; @entity35 ( @entity36 84 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 71 ) , @entity43 ; @entity44 57 ) , @entity19 , @entity21 subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 scorer : @entity21 31 , 58 , 82 booked : @entity39 , @entity35 @entity25 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 61 ) , @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity53 ; @entity59 ( @entity60 61 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 80 ) , @entity63 subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 booked : @entity53 , @entity55 , @entity63 last year it was @entity70 , who prised away the prized assets of @entity73 and @entity74			1
before that , @entity75 swiped @entity77			0
@entity78 made off with @entity79 and @entity80			0
left to pick up the pieces this season has been @entity84 , a man who has coached @entity86 's @entity85 , 20s and 21s			2
it has not been easy			0
while a 1 - 1 draw at @entity90 put them in the box seat for the last eight of the @entity93 , before kick - off here on a rainy , foggy night , the hated @entity29 were almost out of sight in @entity98			1
seven points clear , anything other than victory over their third - placed @entity102 rivals @entity25 would put @entity5 's domestic season in danger of ending in march			1
not that @entity106 is criticised			0
a perceived establishment bias towards @entity29 is bemoaned , with talk of a season blighted by refereeing injustices			1
@entity53 of @entity25 aims to bypass the challenge of @entity5 's @entity19 on sunday night @entity21 , on loan from @entity113 , completed his hat - trick in the second - half to keep @entity5 close to @entity29 inevitably , it was a man widely thought to be the next out of the door who unlocked @entity25 's defence			1
there seemed to be little danger in a tight contest when the ball bounced towards @entity126 and @entity128 target @entity19 just inside the opposition half on 31 minutes			1
the 28 - year - old , with his back to goal , calmly chested it down before volleying an audacious backheel over his shoulder and over the retreating green and white wall			2
@entity113 loanee @entity21 was perhaps the only person in the stadium who saw it coming			1
he raced through a static defence , latched onto the flick and cooly slotted past @entity142 to ease the tension amid the crowd of 43,111			0
@entity5 's @entity146 forward @entity145 ( right ) takes on @entity25 's @entity57 @entity128 may be wary of @entity22 strikers approaching 30 , but in an instant @entity19 displayed a vision rarely seen at @entity150 this season			1
after the break the pair of them were at it again , although this time it was more orthodox			2
@entity19 's sidefooted through ball found his teammate in space and @entity159 , ousted by @entity160 at the @entity161 , finished emphatically into the roof of @entity142 's net			1
on 83 minutes @entity21 had his hat - trick			2
this time @entity165 @entity43 provided the assist as he beat the offside trap once more before another sidefoot past @entity142 's outstretched arms			2
@entity128 loanne @entity63 is booked for @entity25 during the 3 - 0 defeat to @entity5 on sunday @entity21 is approaching the halfway mark of a two - year loan deal			1
many more performances like this and he may well have scouts returning down the well - trodden path to @entity5			2
the home side , however , are not the only ones susceptible to @entity12 's cash - rich big guns			0
at @entity5 's wonderful year - old museum ( complete with statues of @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 ) visitors are informed that it took 12,000 tons of iron and 90,200 cubic metres of concrete to build @entity0			1
they may have used something similar to put together @entity25 's man - mountain @entity57			0
the 22 - year - old defensive midfielder is also said to be wanted by @entity128 and @entity126 but here he was often outshone by the crafty @entity145			0
the @entity146 international , replaced by @entity194 flatterer to deceive @entity195 , is rumoured to have interested @entity70 and on the evidence of this display @entity196 may soon be back here			0
@entity5 's @entity21 ( right ) celebrates his goal against @entity25 with his teammate @entity42 for the visitors , @entity128 outcast @entity63 will have been relishing the opportunity to give a @entity205 audience watching on @entity206 a reminder of his talents			1
he scored a 35 - yard volley last weekend which he celebrated with tears			0
there was more sadness here			0
isolated on the left he did little to show why @entity214 should change his opinion on a night when others jostled for places at the checkout of @entity12 's supermarket			0
@entity5 's noisy fans unfurled a giant banner before the game depicting one of their supporters elbowing a @entity29 fan out of the way underneath the @entity93 while a pot - bellied @entity25 follower looked on uninterested			1
they clearly take solace in the fact they are the only @entity232 side left in the @entity93 but after this routine victory they should not give up hope on domestic glory			2
@entity236 shows multiple live games from @entity238 ’s @entity98 every week as part of a @entity12 football line - up including @entity241 , @entity243 ’s @entity242 , @entity245 ’s @entity244 and @entity247 ’s @entity246			0

@entity19 's audacious back heel set up @entity21 's first
the @entity113 forward added a brace after the break to secure the win
@entity5 stay four points behind @entity232 leaders @entity29
