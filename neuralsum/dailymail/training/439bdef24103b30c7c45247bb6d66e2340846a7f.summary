by @entity1 - @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 17 august 2013 updated : 12:05 est , 18 august 2013 for @entity3 , it was love at first sight			0
‘ i ’m quite an instinctive person and whenever we drove past the house , i always dreamed of living there , ’ she says			1
‘ we had our home on the market and then i saw an advert for the @entity12 in the paper			1
i rang our estate agent and said , “ you have to sell our house in three weeks ! ” he said , “ mrs @entity3 , you have to be realistic			0
” but i ’m not that kind of woman at all , and he did sell it in that time			0
’ the garners now want a home nearer their children ’s schools and are selling the seven - bedroom property – in the village of @entity27 , just east of @entity28 – for £ 1 million			1
best bar none : @entity3 with her son @entity30 at the @entity12 at @entity27 , @entity31 , which had been owned by the @entity33 sweets family for generations @entity3 , 40 , and her husband @entity35 , 41 , who owns an it communications business , bought the house from the @entity33 confectionery family , who had owned it for generations			1
in the garden , outside the dining room , is a ‘ cocoa wheel ’ from the first @entity33 factory , which would have been used to crush cocoa beans			1
toffee and chocolate used to be made in the kitchen and tested on local schoolchildren			0
the @entity33 family , which is best known for brands such as @entity53 , developed what we now know as toffee , by blending brittle @entity58 butterscotch with soft @entity60 caramel			1
before this , the word ‘ toffee ’ had been used to describe any kind of boiled sweet			1
the family was also the first to turn chocolate - making into a mass - distribution business so that buying and eating chocolate was no longer just for the rich			2
they did this by importing cocoa beans at lower costs			2
sweet days : the seven bedroom property outside @entity28 also features a cocoa wheel from a @entity33 factory @entity76 , star of @entity78 reality programme made in @entity79 and fiancee of rapper professor @entity81 , is the current heir to the @entity33 family fortune			1
she has commented on how much her family loves cooking			2
so it is fitting that her family ’s former home is now owned by an equally enthusiastic cook , who not only has a herb garden and greenhouses full of tomatoes but keeps chickens for their freshly laid eggs and has planted a garden of wild garlic			1
the idea of @entity33 chocolates having been being made in their house is appealing to @entity3 ’s children – @entity101 , ten , @entity102 , six , and @entity30 , one			1
but they also adore the house in its own right			0
@entity3 says their friends are always eager to visit			0
it is no wonder , as aside from the enormous size of their bedrooms there is a secret passage that runs from the en suite bathroom down to a swimming pool and sauna area			0
the en suite itself has a sash window with views of the garden			2
@entity123 , managing director of @entity124 , says : ' the @entity12 is one of the most beautiful and unique homes i have seen come to market in @entity28 over the past few years ' ‘ it ’s lovely to lie in the bath and watch the birds in the trees by the window , ’ @entity3 says			1
there is a large balcony attached to the master bedroom where , @entity3 adds , ‘ we sometimes sit with a glass of wine when the children have gone to bed ’			1
for the children , there is a zip wire to play with in the garden as well as a swing , not to mention the three acres of land the garners own in total			0
the garners have had the house , which dates from 1784 , extensively renovated			0
and if they did n’t need to move for schooling , they would set about converting the coach house into a new kitchen			0
@entity3 says : ‘ i love interior design and i ’ve done a lot of property renovation over the years			1
my dad ’s a builder so that ’s helped , and i ’d love to do some more renovation projects once the children are older			0
’ star link : nowadays the former owners are famous for more than @entity53 thanks to the heiress to the toffee fortune @entity76 starring in made in @entity79 as an indication of how skilful her overhauling of the house has been , she opens up her husband ’s study , which has not been redecorated			0
in spite of its double aspect , the moss - green carpet and brown walls make it seem dismal when compared to the light and tasteful decor in the rest of the house			0
@entity123 , managing director of @entity179 , says : ‘ the @entity12 is one of the most beautiful and unique homes i have seen come to market in @entity28 over the past few years			1
‘ when i recount the wonderful history to viewers , it makes their faces light up and feel like the house is truly special – which it is			0
as soon as you walk up the drive , you know it is an impressive house			0
‘ aside its chocolatey past , the location of the @entity12 is incredibly sought - after – @entity27 village has access to all aspects of @entity28 via the @entity198 , allowing you to get to the centre of town in ten minutes			1
‘ it also has numerous outbuildings , which is getting rarer and rarer these days and a big differentiator in the market			2
‘ we have sold a couple of houses in the area at about £ 1 million , so i am confident this house will sell quickly			2
‘ the current market and summer weather is bringing out a much more positive result in serious buyers and faster sales			2
