an @entity1 mother who let her three - year - old son pick out her outfits for five days as part of a fun bonding activity may have brought out her son 's hidden talent for style			1
@entity9 , a mother of two , fashion blogger , and actress decided to let her three - year - old son @entity13 dress her last week and posted pictures of his daring choices on her blog @entity17			1
when it became clear that @entity13 may have inherited his mother 's touch for fashion , @entity9 let her son choose one final outfit and posted a video to @entity25 today of the styling session that almost has over 1,000 views			1
@entity13 was immediately drawn to a pair of matching gold flats in @entity9 's closet			1
those that read @entity9 's first blog post on @entity46 might remember that @entity13 sometimes likes to pick out two different types of shoes but now he 's moved on to choosing two types of skirts			1
' polka dots ! ' exclaims @entity13 as he tugs with his little arm on a dress in his mother 's closet			1
even though @entity13 can pick out his outfits he still needs mommy 's help reaching the clothing sometimes			2
going for the gold : @entity13 picks his mom a pair of golden flats to wear and then chooses some quirky items to go along with them @entity13 's next decision is a long sequin skirt for his mother to wear under the dress			1
yes , under the dress			0
@entity13 is no fashion minimalist as proved by the fact that he chooses a flower ring along with three necklace 's for his mother to wear			2
@entity9 explains that one of the necklaces belonged to @entity13 's great grandmother , another testament to the fact that style runs in their family			1
polka dots ! : @entity13 ca n't get enough of @entity84 's style so he chose a polka dot dress for mom never too much gold : @entity13 pics a long golden sequin skirt for mommy to wear under her dress as promised , @entity9 takes to the streets to run errands in @entity13 's choice of outfit			1
looking quirky , confident , and playful it 's no surprise that @entity9 turned heads everywhere she walked			0
' i have picked out my son ’s outfits almost every day of his three years on this planet			2
i thought it would be fun to turn the tables and let him pick my outfits out for a few days , ' said @entity9 in a blog post she wrote @entity106 posted recently			2
head turning : these pedestrians could n't help but stop and stare at @entity110 's daring outfit switching roles : @entity110 ( left ) decided to let her three - year - old son @entity13 pick out her outfit for five days to see what looks he could come up with on day one of the experiment that created a true stylist , @entity13 chose a laid back rock n ' roll chic look for his mom			1
' the first few items were great : my @entity123 tee , with a gray skirt , and tights			0
i think i ’ll put this in my rotation			0
fabulous choices , @entity130 , ' wrote @entity9 of the conversation with her son			2
when @entity13 told his mother to wear nude shoes along with black tights she was a little hesitant but took his advice anyway			2
when showing the outfit to her husband later that day she expected him to laugh but he did n't notice anything out of the ordinary			0
' i walked down the stairs to show off my outfit to my husband			0
i waited for a laugh , but he did n’t notice anything different , ' she wrote			0
on day two @entity9 said that @entity13 chose her favorite outfit so far which consisted of a @entity148 t - shirt , polka - dot leggings , and gold pointy shoes which she says she would n't have thought to wear			1
rock n ' roll chic : @entity9 enjoyed most of her son @entity13 's rocker outfit but was less enthused about the nude heels she normally would n't pair with black tights ' these polka dotted @entity158 leggings look great with my @entity148 t - shirt			1
and although i would n’t have worn it with these shoes , it does have a fun feel to it			0
it ’s almost like homage to @entity84 , ' she wrote			0
day three was a flower filled outfit that sent her son @entity13 through the roof with excitement			1
' i like flowers ' said @entity13 as he pointed to flowery socks and a petal patterned sundress			2
' they both have flowers , ' he said			0
he then enthusiastically paired the outfit with pink striped shoes and a green jacket			2
while @entity9 said she felt a little self - conscious walking around in her outfit that day one woman actually complimented her			2
' @entity187 note : i was a little self - conscious running my errands that day ; but again , to my surprise i did n’t get one double - take or stare of curiosity			0
instead , i got a woman who stopped me to tell me she liked my socks ! ' she wrote			0
@entity195 's favorite : @entity9 said that @entity13 chose her favorite outfit on day two which consisted of a @entity148 t - shirt , polka - dot leggings , and gold pointy shoes day four proved to be a bit of a challenge for mother and son when @entity13 chose three shirts but no bottoms to go along with it			1
' @entity195 ca n’t go outside without any pants on , ' said @entity9			0
' how about we switch one of these shirts for a pair of pants ? , ' she added			0
@entity13 understood and chose the closest pair of pants along with two different types of leopard print shoes			1
on day five , @entity13 chose his mother another pair of mismatching shoes , this time two boots : one blue and one brown			1
@entity13 chose a shirt with arrows on it for his mother and desperately searched for pants with arrows on it as well but later settled for a pair of jeans			1
' i guess you have to look for some pants that have arrows on them , ' he told his mother with a stern face			0
tired and exhausted from choosing his mother 's clothes , @entity13 was pleased it was the last day of outfit picking			2
' his busy toddler schedule is packed with a lot of fun things and picking out my outfit every day was starting to take too much out of his day			0
when it came down to it , he ’d rather be painting or riding his bike , ' wrote @entity247			0
@entity9 said that the experience taught her that role reversal with children can be therapeutic			0
she also said it taught her to take more risks with her wardrobe , though she may not start wearing no pants and mismatched shoes anytime in the near future			1
