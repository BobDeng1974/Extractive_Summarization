metropolitan police commissioner @entity0 will be quizzed by the @entity1 @entity3 's most senior policeman will today face damaging claims that a 2012 @entity6 probe into alleged police corruption was a whitewash			1
sir @entity0 will be questioned on why his force was dismissive of renewed claims that a notorious detective had been in a corrupt relationship with the gangster father of one of @entity16 's killers			1
in 2012 , it was claimed @entity18 , a sergeant who worked on the first @entity16 murder inquiry , may have helped shield @entity22 's killers			1
sir @entity0 , who took over as @entity25 boss in september 2011 , asked detective superintendent @entity26 to investigate			1
within a few weeks , he gave the @entity25 a clean bill of health			0
today sir @entity0 will be quizzed about this by the @entity1			1
a major review of the @entity16 case by @entity32 has already accused the @entity25 of ' providing misleading reassurance ' on the corruption issue			2
it said the @entity25 's 2012 report , compiled in a few weeks , stated incorrectly that the force had disclosed all ' adverse information ' about @entity39 to the 1998 @entity41 inquiry into @entity22 's death			1
this was wrong , according to mr @entity44 , who suggested mr @entity26 should have considered police intelligence reports and any corrupt motive @entity18 may have had for his ' deficiencies ' while working on the 1993 @entity16 murder probe			0
on the report by mr @entity26 , mr @entity44 said the @entity25 's ' decision to commission such a wide - ranging and significant review over such a tight time - scale was unrealistic and ill - judged '			2
the withering assessment of the review of the @entity16 corruption allegations in 2012 is deeply embarrassing for sir @entity0			1
critics believe the @entity25 boss should apologise publicly for the flawed report			0
at today 's select committee hearing , sir @entity0 will also be grilled over a secret memo revealing the truth behind a ' lorry load ' of anti-corruption files which were shredded by @entity6			1
a summary of the files says that investigators gathered evidence of wholesale criminal behaviour by police officers during an undercover probe at the @entity25 in the 1990s			0
the memo said corrupt officers : stole and trafficked drugs ; shared reward payouts with informants ; sold police intelligence to criminals ; fabricated applications for more rewards ; and accepted bribes to destroy and fabricate evidence			0
but the ' lorry load ' of information that contained the findings – including documents , photographs and videos – was mysteriously shredded during a two - day operation in 2003 when sir @entity87 was commissioner and sir @entity88 his deputy			2
no one at the force has come up with a convincing explanation for why the files were destroyed			0
as revealed in a special investigation in the @entity96 on saturday , disturbing questions remain over whether a web of corrupt officers undermined the inquiries into the murders of @entity16 and private eye @entity100 in 1987			0
one potential link between the cases is @entity18 , who is suspected of working on the @entity100 inquiry in its early stages			0
he is also alleged to have had links with gangster @entity107 , father of @entity16 – one of the two men convicted of @entity22 's murder			2
@entity18 , now retired , denies any wrongdoing .			0

sir @entity0 will be quizzed by the @entity1
*mps* will ask why force was dismissive of renewed corruption claims
it was claimed a sergeant may have helped shield @entity22 's killers
