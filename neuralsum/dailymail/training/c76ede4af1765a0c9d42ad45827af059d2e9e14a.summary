a former ally of @entity1 has accused him of being ‘ insipid ’ and failing to take credit for the @entity3 ’ role in the @entity5			1
@entity6 said attacking the @entity7 ahead of the election in a desperate bid to differentiate themselves was simply a retreat to the party ’s ‘ comfort zone			1
’ in the most damning blow for his former boss , the senior mp said the party faced heavy losses at the @entity19 as they lack a ‘ distinctive proposition ’			1
@entity6 accused the @entity3 of retreating to their ‘ comfort zone ’ instead of defending the coalition the former home office minister was sacked from his job in 2013 and has since criticised his party for having failed to take credit for the economic recovery , bringing down crime or its education reforms			1
‘ we are in @entity33 ’ , he said in an interview			2
‘ we do n't have a distinctive proposition			0
we have sought to distance ourselves from a successful creation [ the @entity5 ] which has required a huge amount of effort and sacrifice by us to make it successful			0
that is the sad irony of our position			0
’ mr @entity6 , the mp for @entity41 , was once seen a rising star of the party and tipped as a future leader , but decided to stand down at the election and leave politics			1
despite previous approaches by the @entity48 , he said he had ruled out joining another political party			0
but he has turned against his former close ally , mr @entity1 , saying that after a successful first two years in office , the @entity3 had returned to ‘ sounding like a party of protest in government ’			1
‘ @entity1 made a decision that he was going to look inwards and talk to his party and reassure it , rather than look outwards and talk to the country and appeal to it ’ , mr @entity6 told the @entity55			1
the @entity3 , who are predicted to lose at least half of the 57 seats they won in 2010 , have said they would prop up either the @entity48 or @entity64 after the next election if neither wins a majority , depending on which emerges as the largest party			2
mr @entity6 predicted that the @entity48 would emerge as the largest party , but said he believed his party would reject a second coalition at which point mr @entity1 would have to resign as leader			1
the @entity3 , who have slipped to single figures in the polls , are predicted to lose at least half of the 57 seats they won in 2010 the next leader , he predicted , would emerge as @entity77 , the @entity3 foreign affairs spokesman and standard bearer for the left of the party , who he said would lead them in opposition			2
but he warned that in 90 per cent of seats in the @entity84 the @entity3 would be in a position from which it is ‘ difficult to recover ’ , and could come fourth , fifth or even sixth in the ballot			2
‘ all we offer is a desire to water down their strong views			0
we offer an insipid moderation			0
whichever party is the biggest one , we will stop them implementing a large number of their ideas			0
’ he said many @entity3 would relish a period in opposition to try and build up their strength			0
‘ being leader of a smaller party would feel unfulfilling and there would be a sense that this era had come to a natural conclusion ’ , he said .			0
