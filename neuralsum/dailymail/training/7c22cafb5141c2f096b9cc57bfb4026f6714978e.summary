four tiny puppies who were dumped behind a @entity3 store inside a battered old shoebox in freezing conditions just days before @entity6 have all found happy endings in loving families in time for @entity9			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and buttons , so named because they were born around pantomime season , have each been successfully rehomed by doting staff at @entity16			1
they have all been adopted by local families , and each will be keeping his or her original name			1
the puppies , now two months old , are heading off to their forever homes after being hand - reared by doting staff at @entity16 the little scamps were named after pantomime characters since they were discovered during the @entity6 season - and their new owners plan to keep their original names the adorable cross-breed pups have been lovingly hand - reared by staff at @entity16 ever since they were found in december by a member of public when they were just five days old			1
but now @entity12 will be going home with @entity33 , 24 , from @entity34 ; @entity35 will be taking @entity11 ; @entity10 is heading off with @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 ; and @entity40 and @entity41 are welcoming buttons into their family			0
as reported in @entity48 on @entity49 , @entity45 staff including @entity46 and @entity47 took it in turns to take the puppies home and look after them , feeding them around the clock until they were old enough to leave for homes of their own			1
it is likely to have been bred by an unscrupulous breeder as presents for the @entity6 market			1
buttons , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity10 finally go home with their forever families just before @entity9 the @entity6 pantomime puppies have all been successfully rehomed in time for @entity9 the four puppies , found in an old slipper box behind a @entity3 in @entity70 , @entity71 , were named @entity12 , @entity11 , @entity72 and buttons , after pantomime characters ' they were found early morning around the back of @entity3 's			1
we know absolutely nothing about the owner			0
it could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has failed to sell them ' fortunately they were rescued in time , and staff have devoted the last six weeks to ensuring that they were given the best possible care to survive without their mother			0
@entity87 , @entity88 , said : ' it was touch - and - go with the puppies when they first came to us			2
' they were so young and their immune systems were not developed , so we had a real challenge keeping them alive			0
' we took it in turns taking them home and bottle - feeding them each hour throughout the night			2
' it 's so fantastic to see that all our hard work has paid - off and we have been able to watch them grow into such happy , healthy , fun - loving little dogs			1
' we have become so attached to this adorable foursome over the last few months and we will really miss them , but we know that this is the perfect outcome for these pups who were at death 's door just before @entity6 , and will now be looking forward to spending @entity9 and the rest of their lives as much - loved family members in happy homes			1
' @entity10 going home with @entity36 , @entity39 , @entity37 and @entity116 @entity40 and @entity41 with buttons prince @entity12 's new owner , @entity33 , said : ' we were shocked when we heard little @entity12 's ordeal			0
' we are so glad that he and his brother and sisters all survived thanks to the dedication of the staff at @entity16 , and that we are now able to give him the loving home he deserves after all he has been through			2
' we absolutely adore him and he is really enjoying making himself at home			0
we have only had him a couple of days but he fits in so well you would think he had been part of the family for years - we certainly could n't do without him and are delighted to be part of @entity12 's furry - tail ending			1
' ' a dog is for life , not just for @entity6 ' is the saying coined by the @entity16 35 years ago to stop people buying puppies on a whim during the festive season , only to give them up halfway through the new year when they realised they could n't handle the responsibility			1
luckily , the @entity6 puppies were found just in time , and immediately taken to the vet to check over before being taken in by the charity			1
@entity35 with @entity11 , left , and @entity33 with @entity12 , right @entity87 manager , @entity88 , said at the time : ' it really is a bit of a miracle that the puppies survived after being so callously dumped in the cold at such a young age			2
' we think the puppies were one or two days old when they were dumped			2
they have been in our care for a week now and their eyes still are n't open			0
' they were found early morning around the back of @entity3 's			2
we know absolutely nothing about the owner			0
it could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has failed to sell them			0
' our centre looks after thousands of abandoned and unwanted dogs every year , but it still shocks us to think that someone could just abandon these helpless puppies without a care if they lived or died			2
' they will have to be hand reared for the next three weeks			2
this takes a lot of care and at the moment it is being shared out between four of the staff			0
' @entity16 's @entity46 and @entity47 , two of the doting staff who hand - reared the puppies ever since they were brought in just five days old the puppies have been hand - reared by @entity16 staff since @entity6 ' the biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums , like how to deal with other dogs			1
we ca n't replace that but we will put them with a mother figure in the future ' mr @entity88 said : ' their behaviour was slightly difficult at first but they have settled down now and are becoming used to human contact			0
it is always touch and go with pups at this age but they 're all feeding well			2
' the biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums , like how to deal with other dogs			0
we ca n't replace that but we will put them with a mother figure in the future			0
' it 's hard to tell what breed they are			0
they have brown patches which look like they could be part @entity208 but they also look quite staffy			0
what we do know is that they are crossbreeds and it will probably become clearer as they grow			0
' @entity16 ceo , @entity215 , said : ' this year sees the 35th anniversary of @entity16 's iconic slogan " a dog is for life , not just for @entity6 " , and sadly it 's as true today as when it was first coined			1
' every year we see a number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around @entity6 when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off			1
' it seems that people are still giving puppies as @entity6 presents without considering the long term ramifications			1
' dogs can provide a world of happiness and enjoyment , and we urge anyone considering a new addition to the family to think it through properly and care for the dogs for its ' entire life			0
' ' every year we see a number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around @entity6 when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off ' the puppies were found around the back of the supermarket in a battered old shoe box by a member of the public @entity16 cares for over 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year for a variety of reasons , including those that have become unwanted gifts			1
staff work around the clock looking after the 1,500 dogs that are based in their 18 rehoming centres across the @entity259 and one in @entity261 .			0

puppies were just five days old when found by a member of the public
