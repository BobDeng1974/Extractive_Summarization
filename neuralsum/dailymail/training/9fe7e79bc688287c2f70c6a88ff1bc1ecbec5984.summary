dressed in casual t - shirts with their arms around each other , the men posing for photographs could be documenting a visit to any tourist attraction in the world			0
but these @entity9 daytrippers are n't admiring a famous painting or well - known monument - they are taking pictures of @entity14 airstrikes against brutal @entity16 terrorists in the @entity18 city of @entity19			1
with explosions taking place behind them in a city where @entity24 have butchered hundreds of @entity25 over the last few weeks , the carefree men seem more interested in documenting the moment on digital cameras and mobile phones than coming to terms with the horrific reality of the situation			1
as street fighting rages in the city - which has a population of 400,000 - some missiles fired by @entity24 militants have even crossed over the border and damaged homes belonging to @entity9 families			1
the fighting has led to a column of @entity9 tanks patrolling the area around the largely porous border to protect against any threat posed the islamists meanwhile @entity14 airstrikes hit @entity24 targets in the @entity19 suburbs this morning in the hope of halting an advance that led to the chilling sight of a black jihadist flag being raised over a building in the east of the city yesterday			1
this afternoon @entity9 president @entity81 said the fall of @entity19 to the terrorists was imminent , despite promising he would n't allow such an event to happen only days ago			0

@entity24 fighters using tanks and heavy weapons looted from captured army bases in @entity122 and @entity18 have been pounding @entity114 forces in the strategic town for days			2
@entity9 president @entity81 said the coalition air campaign launched last month would not be enough to halt the islamic state advance and called for greater cooperation with the @entity18 opposition , which is fighting both @entity24 and forces loyal to @entity18 president @entity130			1
@entity9 tanks and other ground forces have been stationed along the border within a few hundred meters of the fighting in @entity19 - also known as @entity134 - but have not intervened			2
crowds of onlookers have gathered in the hills around the @entity9 village of @entity138 , where just a few miles to the south @entity114 fighters are battling against militants from the @entity16			2
from their relatively safe haven the people have been able to take photographs of the increasingly intense fighting in @entity19 over the past few weeks , as @entity24 creep ever closer to the city centre			1
this morning , almost as if they were watching a fireworks display , the spectators took photographs of explosion after explosion as warplanes from the @entity153 hammered terrorist targets in the east and south west of the city			0
they are not alone in their fascination with watching a conflict unfold ; just weeks ago a fierce three - way battle between @entity18 government forces , @entity160 - linked rebels and fighters from the @entity16 drew large crowds in neighbouring @entity165			0

@entity176 : last month residents in @entity167 took took to the mountains in t - shirts , shorts and sunglasses to watch a bloody battle unfold in the town of @entity174 , across the @entity18 border beneath them sightseeing : overlooking orchards spilling down the mountainside , the platform was the perfect spot for the tourists watch the battle near @entity174 crossing in early september rebel tank : residents in @entity167 nonchalantly watch the fighting in the @entity18 town of @entity174 war tourism has a long history , dating back millennia when accounts of great battles would be written and told by individuals who claim to have witnessed them first hand			0
by the 1600s @entity199 painter @entity198 was travelling on war ships in order to sketch fighting with @entity204 vessels - while the battles of @entity206 and @entity207 in the 1800s both had spectators who had journeyed deliberately to the conflict zone in order to watch events unfold			0
in the 1860s @entity212 organised holidays for @entity216 tourists on @entity218 battlefields , and similar guided tours were organised available for those interested in locations associated with the @entity222			0
in fact during the @entity223 in 1854 - considered the first battle of the @entity222 - prince @entity226 is said to have invited women from the nearby town of @entity229 to take up positions on a nearby mountainside to watch his men fight			0
@entity9 has demanded the @entity14 carry out military action against @entity18 president @entity130 a a condition for further @entity9 support in fighting against @entity16 militants			1

in order to put a no - fly zone in place , however , the @entity14 would need to conduct targeted strikes on @entity130 's air defences , as well as provide additional support for millions of potential refugees			0
' we want to have a no - fly zone , we want to have a safe have on our border , ' mr @entity238 told @entity257			0
@entity9 is reluctant to assist @entity114 fighters because they are affiliated with the banned @entity259 ( @entity259 ) - a group recently described as ' the same as @entity24 ' by president @entity81 ( pictured ) ' otherwise all these burdens will continue to go on the shoulder of @entity9 and other neighbouring countries , ' he said , referring to the refugee crisis			2
' we are ready to do everything if there is a clear strategy that , after @entity24 , we can be sure our border is protected , ' mr @entity238 went on to say			0
@entity9 has been criticised for an apparent lack of effort in targeting @entity24 in neighbouring @entity18 and @entity122 , although talks will take place next week to discuss the country 's contribution to the @entity14 / @entity275 coalition currently carrying out airstrikes on the terror group			1
