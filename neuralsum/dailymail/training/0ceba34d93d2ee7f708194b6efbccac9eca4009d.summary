attention ladies and gentlemen ! for his next feat , @entity2 will cross the city of @entity5 on a tightrope 50 stories in the air			1
the daredevil performer revealed his latest plan in an interview with outside , and it is not for the faint of heart			2
he said he will begin at the @entity14 and walk a wire strung at an uphill 15 - degree angle across the @entity17 to the @entity18			1
then he 'll come down to ground level , walk back to @entity14 , and cross another wire to the @entity26 tower			1
it is all set to go down on november 2 , and , of course , will air as a live - tv special on @entity37			1
this setting is shockingly urban for the tightrope walker , whose last two nerve - racking feats involved him crossing the @entity21 and @entity42			1
the city also presents challenges that seem to make @entity2 a bit nervous			0
' it ’s gon na be cold			0
it ’s gon na be windy , ' he said			0
' that ’s the challenge			0
the other walks were enjoyable , peaceful			0
' seeing as those previous two ' peaceful ' walks took place 1,400 feet in the air , it is safe to say the performer has a far different definition of the word than most			1
thrill - seeker : @entity2 has previously crossed @entity42 and the @entity21 at 1,400 feet in the air @entity2 will be untethered for the walk , which he prefers			1
he was tethered for the @entity42 walk , but was not for his performance in the @entity21 , meaning that any slip would be fatal			2
seven members of his family have fallen to their death , most recently @entity2 ’s great - grandfather @entity67 during a 1978 walk in @entity69			2
that fear of possible death is what brings in the audiences however , says @entity2			0
' the public is fascinated with a guy on tv that could die at any second			0
' he quickly added , ' now , do they wan na see me die ? i do n’t think so			0
