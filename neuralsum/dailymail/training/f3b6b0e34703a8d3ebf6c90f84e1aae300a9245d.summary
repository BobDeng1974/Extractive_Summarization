the 32 - year - old said : ' he ca n’t live a normal life			2
' it really upsets me but there ’s nothing we can do about it , so we just try to make things as fun as possible when we go out			0

' unfortunately the treatment we have for urticarias is n’t particularly good and the best treatment is to stay out of the cold			0
' all i can say is that it seems to go in most people , but you ca n’t predict how long it ’s going to last and you do n’t come across adults who have had it all their lives			0
' it will go in the end but with some people it takes weeks , sometimes months or even years if they are unlucky , so he has been unfortunate			0
