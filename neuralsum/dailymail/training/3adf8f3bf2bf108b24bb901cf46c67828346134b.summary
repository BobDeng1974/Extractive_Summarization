' when he presented the analysis on @entity2 , i felt more tension with him			0
it was good to see			0

@entity3 attempt to regroup at the @entity6 during last year 's 4 - 1 defeat by their cross-city rivals @entity176 was on song as @entity3 were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity2 towards the end of last season ' he has made a great contribution and also the assist for the [ @entity30 ] goal			1
