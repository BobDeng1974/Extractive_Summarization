new launch : @entity1 is being sold on the streets of @entity3 and vendors use the cash raised to pay for drugs a new @entity8 - inspired magazine sold by drug addicts who can use the £ 2 profit on each issue to fund their habit was today criticised by police			1
' illegal ! ' was launched in east @entity3 last week and argues everyone ' has a right ' to do what they want with their bodies - even if that means an illegal ' acid trip in @entity21 ' or an ' ecstasy - fuelled night in @entity23 '			1
sellers , who pay £ 1.50 per copy , charge £ 3.50 for it and can tell buyers they will ' more than likely spend the money on drugs '			1
buyers can ' help make them a bit less criminal ' , the founders say			2
but it is not clear whether the sellers or the magazine 's proprietors are breaking the law			1
following the magazine 's launch last week , one drug addict sold 100 copies in a few days , pocketing £ 350			1
its @entity43 founder @entity42 has said giving drug addicts access to the magazine will help them get money ' beyond theft and prostitution '			1
@entity51 , head of @entity1 ! ’s team in @entity3 , told @entity53 he met mr @entity42 while filming a documentary - and decided he wanted to bring the magazine to @entity56			1
mr @entity51 , 26 , said : ‘ the whole war on drugs is something i 've kept a close eye on over the last few years			2
i really like @entity42 's ethos , and thought education is lacking in the @entity56 - not just on the drug itself , but how to take it , and on drug users			2
‘ he 'd always had this dream that he wanted to take it to globally - and i said to @entity42 , “ i want to take this to @entity3 , let 's do this ”			1
‘ there 's many misconceptions about drug users			0
this magazine challenges those misconceptions and stereotypes			0
it 's not necessarily there to create a revenue to spend it on drugs			1
campaign : illegal ! founder @entity42 , centre , with the mayor of @entity85 , where his magazine is widely sold to help drug addicts there ‘ @entity42 is creating an alternative to crime and prostitution to generate revenue			1
he knows at the end of the day that they probably will spend this on drugs , but at least they 've been given the option to sell something that does n't cause them to commit crime			1
‘ he 's a realist , and i 'm a realist			0
we want to hope that the user reads the content and takes certain things on board , and hopefully gets themselves out of the hole they 're in - but you know nine out of the ten are probably going to spend it on drugs			1
there ’s that real hope that the one in ten wo n't			0
’ he added : ‘ i want to create a conversation			0
current drug policies clearly do n't work			0
drug - related crime on the increase			0
this should n't be a judicial issue			0
this is an educational issue			0
‘ i 've been known to take drugs in the past , but more on a recreational level - it 's never something that 's been a dependency for me			1
' one of my very close friends happens to be a heavy user , and he is a vendor who sells the magazine in @entity132			0
i think being involved in this magazine has helped him			0
’ mr @entity42 added : ' we do n’t think the magazine breaks any laws			0
we have told people that , if someone is unhappy about the magazine being sold near a particular place , then they should move on and not cause any problem			0
' illegal ! has sold around 15,000 copies in @entity85 and last week 2,000 copies of the @entity146 language version of the magazine were handed out to drug addicts in @entity3 , who sell them on the street			1
the magazine 's foreword states : ' everyone has a right to do with their body as they wish and , if that means a two - day acid trip in @entity21 or an ecstasy - fuelled night in @entity23 , then so be it			1
what we lack is education			0
welcome to @entity1 ! magazine in @entity3			1
' mr @entity42 , editor - in - chief , admitted that he has not yet talked to @entity163 about the magazine , but said he was ' planning on doing so '			2
chief inspector @entity165 , of the @entity166 , said he was ' not a big fan ' of the idea			1
he said : ' we would always wish to reduce crime and the generators for crime , which funding a drug habit often is of course			0
this initiative seeks to legitimise and formalise fundraising for illegal drug use which i 'm not sure is the answer			0
launch : illegal ! is being sold in east @entity3 and one seller is said to have pocketed £ 350 so far ' there is always the risk here of funding and consequently increasing a person 's drug use to the point where the selling of the magazine no longer covers the cost or the initiative fails , so you 're back to square one , or worse because you 're now consuming more drugs with all the health and crime risks that poses			1
' @entity53 has asked @entity163 if they are investigating whether selling the magazine constitutes illegal activity , but the force is yet to respond			1
illegal ! magazine states in its blurb : ' whether you smoke dried leaves , sniff coke , inject heroin or neck all the pills you can buy from a pensioner on the street , it 's no concern to the police or the prison service , it 's a health and social concern			1
' illegal ! magazine is a helping hand to those drug users who have become dependent and forced into criminality or prostitution to get their next fix			2
' they sell the magazine on the streets of @entity85 and now @entity3			1
help them - buy the magazine and make them a bit less criminal			2
' mr @entity42 , however , said the aim of the magazine was to spark a debate about drug use			0
he said : ' we are challenging the war on drugs			0
the magazine is about the drug culture , good and bad			0
the point is that anyone can sell this magazine and we hope that it will spark a debate about drug use			2
' we ca n't just ignore that drugs are everywhere and there are heavy drug users on the streets who often fund their habit through theft or prostitution			2
this offers them an alternative			0
it is about breaking the cycle between drug use and crime			0
' @entity23 resident @entity258 said the ' very idea ' of drug addicts selling magazines on the street specifically to fund their drug addiction was ' ridiculous '			2
the 32 - year - old it worker said : ' the whole idea will just lead to a vicious circle of an ever - increasing dependency on drugs			2
' drugs are still illegal in the @entity56 and to blatantly sell magazines which are designed to help fund the purchase of drugs is frankly ridiculous			2
' @entity271 , 41 , said : ' i 'll happily buy the @entity8 as it aims to help people , but this magazine is just a money spinner for drug addicts to get more drugs			1
' the legality of the whole operation must be questionable and i certainly wo n't be buying a copy			0

@entity85 - based @entity1 ! has started selling issues in east @entity3
sellers can tell buyer : ' i 'll more than likely spend the money on drugs '
addicts buy magazine for £ 1.50 and can then sell to *public* for £ 3.50
buyers can help sellers get income ' beyond theft and prostitution '
local inspector ' not a big fan ' but it 's not clear if practice is illegal
