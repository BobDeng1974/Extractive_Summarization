@entity0 : professor @entity1 , said officials representing ' all the main countries and regions of the world ' insisted on changes to the report a top @entity9 academic has dramatically revealed how government officials forced him to change a hugely influential scientific report on climate change to suit their own interests			1
@entity15 professor @entity1 electrified the worldwide debate on climate change on friday by sensationally publishing a letter online in which he spelled out the astonishing interference			2
he said the officials , representing ‘ all the main countries and regions of the world ’ insisted on the changes in a late - night meeting at a @entity24 conference centre two weeks ago			1
three quarters of the original version of the document ended up being deleted			0
prof @entity1 claimed the intervention amounted to a serious ‘ conflict of interest ’ between scientists and governments			1
his revelation is significant because it is rare for climate change experts to publicly question the process behind the compilation of reports on the subject			0
prof @entity1 , @entity15 ’s professor of business and @entity43 , was one of two ‘ co-ordinating lead authors ’ of a key report published by the @entity46 @entity47 ( @entity47 ) earlier this month			1
his chapter of the 2,000 - page original report concerned ways countries can co-operate to reduce carbon emissions			2
@entity47 reports are supposed to be scrupulously independent as they give scientific advice to governments around the world to help them shape energy policies – which in turn affect subsidies and domestic power bills			1
prof @entity1 said the government officials in @entity24 fought to make big changes to the full report ’s ‘ summary for policymakers ’			1
this is the condensed version usually cited by the world ’s media and politicians			0
he said their goal was to protect their ‘ negotiating stances ’ at forthcoming talks over a new greenhouse gas reduction treaty			0
prof @entity1 told @entity77 yesterday that he had been especially concerned by what happened at a special ‘ contact group ’			0
he was one of only two scientists present , surrounded by ‘ 45 or 50 ’ government officials			2
he said almost all of them made clear that ‘ any text that was considered inconsistent with their interests and positions in multilateral negotiations was treated as unacceptable			0
’ many of the officials were themselves climate negotiators , facing the task of devising a new treaty to replace the @entity94 in negotiations set to conclude next year			0
prof @entity1 said : ‘ this created an irreconcilable conflict of interest			1
it has got to the point where it would be reasonable to call the document a summary by policymakers , not a summary for them , and it certainly affects the credibility of the @entity47			2
the process ought to be reformed			0
’ he declined to say which countries had demanded which changes , saying only that ‘ all the main countries and regions were represented ’			1
some deletions were made at the insistence of only one or two nations – because under @entity47 rules , the reports must be unanimous			1
he revealed the original draft of the summary contained a lot of detail on how international co-operation to curb emissions might work , and how it could be funded			0
the final version contains only meaningless headings , however , with all details removed			0
@entity47 reports are supposed to be scrupulously independent as they give scientific advice to governments around the world to help them shape energy policies - which in turn affect subsidies and domestic power bills his comments follow a decision two weeks earlier by @entity139 ’s professor @entity138 to remove his name from the summary of an earlier volume of the full @entity47 report , on the grounds it had been ‘ sexed up ’ by the same government officials and had become overly ‘ alarmist ’			1
@entity148 ’ letter provoked a response from @entity150 , policy director of the @entity151 ’ @entity152 and a fierce critic of those who dissent from climate change orthodoxy			0
mr @entity150 asked on @entity156 whether it showed the ‘ @entity47 government approval process is broken ’			1
yesterday he admitted the affair showed that ‘ the @entity47 is not a perfect process , though it ’s hard to imagine a better one ’			2
prof @entity162 , the head of climate science at the @entity164 , @entity165 , said that between them , professors @entity138 and @entity1 had shown the process was ‘ polluted by obvious politics ’			0
the @entity47 headquarters in @entity169 could not be reached for comment			2
by @entity171 @entity173 's biggest power station is suing the government for losing a lucrative contract after a @entity77 investigation revealed that it burns wood from precious @entity9 forests as a ‘ green ’ alternative to coal			1
@entity181 is committed to switching from coal to ‘ biomass ’ , or wood pellets			1
in december , @entity186 secretary @entity185 promised the @entity188 plant two lucrative ‘ contracts for difference ’ – which would see it earn £ 105 for every megawatt hour it generates , rather than the normal price of £ 50			2
@entity173 's biggest co2 polluter : @entity181 is suing the government for losing a lucrative contract after a @entity77 investigation revealed that it burns wood from precious @entity9 forests as a ¿ green ¿ alternative to coal the extra money would come from subsidies funded by consumers ’ household bills			1
but this paper revealed that much of its biomass is shipped in from historic wetland hardwood forests – 3,000 miles away in @entity207			1
environmentalists say this is destroying endangered species ’ habitats , and increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere			0
ministers have now withdrawn their promise to guarantee profits for the part of the plant using biomass			0
this wiped £ 400million off the company ’s share price and prompted the firm to start legal action			0
a spokesman for mr @entity185 said : ‘ @entity181 was informed that this project no longer qualifies for the award of contract			0

officials from all main countries ' insisted on changes in late - night meeting '
intervention amounts to ' serious conflict of interest ' , claims @entity15 prof
@entity47 reports are supposed to be independent as they help shape policy
@entity181 in @entity188 has committed to switching from coal to biomass
and the government agreed to pay *double* for power generated this way
but offer withdrawn after it *emerged* it was shipping wood from the @entity9
the biomass pellets were being brought 3,000 miles from @entity207
