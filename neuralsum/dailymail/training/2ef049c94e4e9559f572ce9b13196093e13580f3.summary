by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 senses a new beginning is under way for him and his @entity6 team - mates as they finally free themselves from the hangover of last winter 's @entity10 whitewash			1
@entity2 ( three for 65 ) and @entity11 ( three for 52 ) had to work especially hard to take six @entity12 wickets between them as the tourists closed day three of the third @entity15 on 323 for eight in reply to 569 for seven declared			1
but their deserved success , in batting conditions at the @entity18 , is a prime indication to @entity2 - after some disappointing showings of late - that @entity6 are back on track			1
' i think maybe the ( senior ) players have put too much pressure on themselves - after what , since the @entity47 ( last summer ) , has been a pretty tough run , ' he said			2
' maybe we got a bit uptight			0
before this test match , @entity52 came to a few of us and said " just go and express yourself - do n't worry about having to take responsibility ... just go and play , like it 's your first test match			1
" i think that 's shone through a little bit			2
' @entity38 and @entity40 , along with another century from new boy @entity59 , helped @entity6 pile up the runs before the bowlers got to work			1
' @entity62 played fantastically with the bat , and @entity11 and i have contributed with the ball , ' added @entity2			1
' everyone was having a laugh , and smiles on their faces , and i think that showed in our cricket			0
we kept the energy up throughout the whole day			2
' improvement : every aspect of @entity6 's display has considerable improved at the @entity18 reliable : and @entity11 was again at it taking three wickets so far the defensive tactics @entity6 were forced to adopt for much of the winter have been hard to shake off for @entity2			1
' it was a bit of leaving the past behind , and just going and expressing yourself , ' he said			0
' personally , i am an attacking cricketer - and maybe [ had fallen ] into a defensive mind - set			2
' that was the chat i had with @entity52 , and it freed me up a little bit			0
' the upshot is that @entity6 have prospects here of a series - levelling victory			1
' we 're in a great position in this test match			2
we hope the wicket , late day four ( into ) day five will deteriorate a little bit			2
' although off - spinner @entity98 picked up two wickets from false shots , @entity2 insists @entity6 profited from their collective discipline and industry			1
' we created enough pressure throughout the day			2
i think you saw that with @entity106 picking up the two wickets he did			0
you did n't feel like you could go too full ... so you had to bowl back of a length , and then risk one an over fuller			0
' we did what we said we wanted to do this morning ... created pressure - and i think we got our rewards at the end of the day			1
' positivity : and the mood has lifted considerably among the @entity6 players half - centuries from @entity117 and @entity118 held @entity6 up , but @entity11 and @entity2 still put themselves in elite company as only the third pair of pace bowlers to rack up 500 test wickets in partnership - joining @entity124 's @entity123 and @entity125 , and @entity127 ' @entity126 and @entity128			1
@entity2 grew up marvelling at their deeds , and said : ' to go into the company of @entity125 and @entity123 and @entity126 and @entity128 is a huge honour - four heroes of mine growing up			1
' i think it shows the value of partnerships as bowlers ... @entity11 and i are constantly talking , not just out on the field but in nets together			0
even now , we 've played a lot of test match cricket , i 'll still ask @entity11 at the end of an over " what shall i bowl ? " ' we work together really tightly			0
so to have got 500 wickets together is massive			0
i hope we can take a few more			0
' @entity118 fell to neither , instead miscuing a pull at @entity147 to midwicket			0
he said : ' i was really disappointed , the way i got out , because i was batting so well			0
we needed that one partnership to go on			0
' @entity6 , meanwhile , may still have the option of enforcing the follow - on - but not if the hard - worked @entity2 has any say in whether he gets a rest before trying to take another 10 wickets			1
' i 've not discussed it with @entity156 , but if you 're asking me it 's 100 % off limits , ' he said .			0

@entity2 senses a new beginning is underway for @entity6 in third test
@entity12 close day three on 323 - 8 in reply to @entity6 's 569
