former @entity1 striker @entity0 has revealed he quit the @entity3 giants after fearing he was @entity4 - positive			1
@entity0 joined the @entity6 outfit from @entity9 side @entity7 for £ 3.5million in 1997 , scoring a staggering 23 goals in his first 10 league games for the club			1
however , a series of injuries destabilised his career in @entity16 including a reserve match against @entity18 on november 13 , 2000			1
ex-rangers forward @entity0 has revealed that he quit the club after fearing he had @entity21 @entity22 ( @entity9 ) - 19 goals in 34 league games - ( 1994 - 95 ) @entity7 ( @entity9 ) - 33 in 60 - ( 1995 - 97 ) @entity1 - 32 in 30 - ( 1997 - 2001 ) @entity25 ( @entity9 , on loan ) - 1 in 9 - ( 1999 - 00 ) @entity27 ( @entity9 ) - 0 in 3 - ( 2001 - 02 ) @entity28 ( @entity9 ) - 2 in 5 - ( 2002 ) @entity29 ( @entity9 ) 8 in 10 - ( 2002 - 03 ) @entity7 - 0 in 3 - ( 2004 - 05 ) during the encounter the then 30 - year - old forward was on the receiving end of a crunching tackle that caused his right shinbone to bleed profusely			1
after hospital tests and treatment for what was perceived as a ' deep wound ' , @entity0 returned to action in the @entity41 to train with the reserve team where he suffered a shooting pain in his right knee and leg			1
further scans at @entity47 showed an inflammation of the shinbone and more worryingly that properties of his blood had been attacked by a lymphogranuloma or lymphosarcoma - common symptoms for those that suffer with hiv / aids			1
however , in his imminent autobiography ' @entity59 - @entity58 of the @entity60 ' , which is serialised in the @entity61 ; the now 44 - year - old reveals that his worst fears were n't confirmed after flying to @entity9 for treatment			2

i needed my family around me and wanted to undergo further tests in @entity9 to understand exactly what was going on , the risks and chances of recovery			2
' i had to return to @entity9 , and not on a temporary basis			0
i asked my lawyer to speak to @entity1 about an early dissolution of my contract			0
' they had no objections to the premature ending of our relationship , which was something i really appreciated , although it also showed me how serious my condition was			0
' luckily , i did n’t have to wait long to learn i was simply suffering a stress fracture of the tibial axis of the knee			0
this diagnosis was given by doctors in @entity27			0
in @entity3 they had n’t got it right this time , even if the results of three blood tests confirmed some anomalies that could n’t be overlooked			0

my drama had been resolved in the best way possible , and i put behind me the endless days of terror when the worst case scenario was swimming around in my head			0
