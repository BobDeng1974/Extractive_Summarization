by @entity0 published : 08:08 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 4 june 2013 paleontologists have discovered a family of triceratops , including one of the most complete skeletons ever found			1
the bones were uncovered on a ranch near @entity8 , @entity9 , by a team from the @entity12 - based @entity11 and the @entity13 from the @entity14			1
they believe the rare find of skeletons belonged either a to a parent group of triceratops or two females and a youngster			0
paleontologists from the @entity11 and @entity13 prepare the excavated bones the team uncovered bones from three triceratops at the dig near @entity8 , @entity9 the three - horned dinosaurs lived more than 65million years ago and were often meals for predators , such as @entity31 , which left behind only their skulls for dinosaur trophy hunters to find			1
paleontologists also discovered the left foot and left leg of a @entity31 , which roamed the same area			2
it is believed the three @entity26 were attacked by a @entity31			2
@entity11 president @entity41 said he was excited when he first saw the @entity31 foot , but he soon realized the potential presented by the @entity26 bones			1
' we have been given a rare , i would say unprecedented , opportunity , ' @entity41 told @entity48 the dig will continue for about four weeks as @entity41 while his 25 - person team excavate the site			2
triceratops skeleton at the @entity53			0
paleontologists believe their discovery could be one of the most complete ever found @entity31 used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures , a new theory @entity58 into @entity26 fossils from the @entity60 shows that the @entity68 apex predator first slew its prey , then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient - rich neck meat hidden by body @entity73 was well known to feed on the @entity26 but until now few have questioned how it got around the herbivore 's tough neck frill			1
he said the fossils will provide a more complete example of the @entity26 , which in mass was about the size of an elephant and stood more than 7ft tall			0
mr @entity41 said : ' if you could imagine a person , 6ft tall , inside the stomach of one of these adult triceratops , they could n't reach each side of the rib cage , ' @entity41 said			0
the @entity90 in @entity91 currently houses a @entity26 that has about 75 per cent of its skeleton - believed to be the most complete find to date			0
mr @entity41 told @entity94 that this skeleton only needs to be 50 per cent complete to be among the four most complete skeletons to be found			0
mr @entity41 said few @entity26 skeletons have ever been discovered , so the new find could provide a lot of information			1
he said the family group is an ' unprecedented ' find			0
' we have the opportunity to really rewrite the book on @entity26 , ' he told @entity94			1
after the fossils are prepared and mounted into a display , they could be sent to the @entity13 gallery , he said .			0

the bones of three @entity26 were found by a team of 25 paleontologists
