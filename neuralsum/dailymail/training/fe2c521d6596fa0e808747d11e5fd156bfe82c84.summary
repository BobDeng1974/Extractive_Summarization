by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 18:42 est , 15 october 2013 two 20 - foot - deep disposal pits opened in western @entity2 on monday to help ranchers dispose of tens of thousands of cattle carcasses littering the countryside since an early october blizzard decimated herds			1
up to 4 feet of snow fell in the @entity11 area during the storm , killing at least 10,000 to 20,000 head of livestock , state officials say			1
the @entity15 estimates this part of the state lost at least 5 percent of its cattle , which is mostly raised for beef			2
ranchers are encouraged to bring carcasses to the sites in @entity23 , which were built to state @entity25 guidelines , in an effort to prevent the contamination of waterways that can come from home burials			1
decimated : cattle stocks were decimated in western @entity2 last week as a freak blizzard took ranchers by surprise , killed tens of thousands of heads ' some people might decide to bury their losses right where they are , ' @entity34 , public information officer with the county 's @entity35 said monday			1
the number of dead cattle will likely rise as more losses are documented			0
last week 's rain added moisture to pastures already saturated by the quickly melting snow , making it difficult for ranchers to traverse the vast terrain to assess losses and tend to stressed but surviving animals , said @entity52 , executive director of the @entity15			1
' the priority right now is taking care of the livestock that made it through the storm , ' @entity52 said			2
' once it dries up , ranchers will focus on the disposal			2
' another snowstorm heading into the @entity11 on monday was expected to bring up to a foot of snow , threatening to complicate the soggy mess			2
dead where they stood : as many as 20,000 cattle are thought to have died where they stood			2
now the state has dug two 20 - foot pits for their disposal dangerous : tens of thousands of cattle still litter the @entity2 countryside and officials are pushing for proper disposal instead of home burials that can contaminate water @entity25 rules require carcasses to be burned , buried to a depth of 4 feet or disposed of by a licensed rendering plant within 36 hours of death , though @entity2 gov. @entity85 has waived the standard timeframe , recognizing the difficulty in meeting that deadline			1
the burial sites are located in the eastern part of @entity23 with access to @entity92 , but that could be a 100 - mile - plus drive for a rancher raising cattle in @entity97			2
' they want to make sure they 're not in streams and stuff , because they can contaminate the water , ' @entity98 said			1
the pits are dug specifically to avoid such health problems , as burial sites must be at least 1,000 feet from surface water , floodplains , rivers or private or public drinking water wells			0
burial is also prohibited when the primary subsurface material 20 feet below the bottom of the pit is primarily sand or gravel or when the depth to an aquifer is less than 20 feet from the bottom of the pit			0
black and bloated carcasses of cows still lie rotting in the thousands in scenes more akin to an apocalyptic nightmare than the aftermath of a snowstorm			1
but with no federal livestock disaster program in place , many ranchers were left wondering how they would survive the setback			1
scarred : today their black and bloated corpses still scarred the picturesque flatlands to the west of the @entity136 as the cleanup began nightmare : a cow lies dead in the snow in scenes more like an apocalyptic nightmare than the aftermath of a blizzard ' the worst i 've ever seen ' : @entity146 , 27 , left , and @entity147 , 25 , ride through pasture as they survey the damage to their herd ' this is the worse than i 've ever seen for loss of livestock , ' said rancher @entity147 , 25 , who works on his family ranch east of the town of @entity158 , as he began counting his losses			1
' some people were very well prepared and lost 50 per cent of their herd , ' said state veterinarian @entity161 told @entity162			0
' some were not prepared and took no losses			0
there was no rhyme or reason to it			0
' ' it will be two weeks to a month before we have a better idea of the impact , ' he added			0
@entity174 , who ranches on the prairie near @entity176 about 40 miles northeast of the @entity11 , said he lost about 70 cows and some calves , about 15 percent of his herd			1
a calf would normally sell for $ 1,000 , while a mature cow would bring $ 1,500 or more , he said			0
i ’m the eternal optimist and this is really bad , ' @entity174 , 60 , said			0
' the livestock loss is just catastrophic			0
... it ’s pretty unbelievable			0
' on top of the vast swathes of cattle killed in the blizzard , many also wandered off as powerful winds blew them far from their home pastures			0
lost cattle : ranchers raced to find cattle that drifted beyond fenced pastures during the blizzard october blizzard : this was the scene in @entity203 , @entity2 , as the storm dumped 33 inches of snow in @entity2 's @entity11 area last weekend			1

many ranchers lost up to half of their herds leaving *livelihoods* in ruins
carcasses could contaminate water if left to rot or *improperly* buried
