by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 25 june 2012 running battles have broken out between police and protesters outside a @entity5 oil refinery facing mass job cuts			1
today violence erupted at the @entity9 plant in @entity10 where its @entity13 - based owners @entity11 have collapsed and left at least 200 out of work			1
@entity10 police have arrested three people at the scene after they clashed with union members and political activists			1
out of hand : protesters blockaded the site in @entity10 and police were called in to break it up battle : a protester is cuffed and dragged off as violence breaks out at the @entity28 in @entity10 this afternoon anger : people are on a picket line at the site because around 200 people could lose their jobs about 850 people work at the refinery in @entity37 near @entity38 , and it is feared that unless another company steps in all the workers could lose their jobs			1
just yesterday @entity43 leader @entity42 said the government 's decision not to give financial backing to the refinery was ' completely wrong '			1
' i think they are showing an absolute abdication of their responsibility to the workers at @entity9 , ' the @entity43 leader said			1
trouble : this man is cuffed and detained by two police officers today fury : a young man screams at a policeman as he tries to push the line of people back away from the gates the @entity63 claimed it would not be sustainable for the government to provide assistance			1
administrators @entity66 have said the 200 jobs would go this week , which led to the picket line outside			1
meanwhile the @entity5 's second biggest oil refinery , near @entity71 , @entity72 , reported a big financial loss but its new owner said an efficiency drive will help it make money even when oil prices fall			2
support : around 100 @entity80 workers and their supporters were there as 200 workers lose their jobs this week battle : police push people back from the refinery gates but soon afterwards violence breaks out stuck : drivers were unable to move their trucks out of the refinery today when trouble flared @entity94 is cutting the price of petrol			1
from tomorrow customers at @entity94 ’s 196 filling stations will pay no more than 127.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 132.7p a litre for diesel			2
@entity94 said this was the lowest price for a litre of fuel since february 2011			2
the latest cut means @entity94 has shaved 14p off the cost of a litre of fuel since the end of april , reducing the cost of filling up a family car by almost £ 10			2
@entity113 ’s said it was reducing its fuel prices too , with petrol and diesel coming down ' by up to 2p per litre ' from tomorrow			2
the @entity117 said the 14p @entity94 reduction since april was welcome			0
while @entity94 had dropped its petrol price largely in line with wholesale , the @entity5 average was down 10.5p a litre since the record high in mid-april			1
@entity125 is also dropping prices , with its petrol and diesel coming down by up to 2p a litre from tomorrow			0
@entity131 - focused @entity130 bought the @entity133 refinery , which accounts for 15 % of production from @entity5 refineries and produces around 1.5 billion litres of kerosene a year for aircraft fuel , from oil giant @entity138 in july			0
the operation made an underlying loss of 30.2 million @entity141 dollars ( £ 19.4 million ) in the first eight months under new ownership as refining margins in northern @entity144 were squeezed by overcapacity			0
but its plans to make efficiency savings and diversify the business into producing more oil - based chemicals and diesel are expected to add two to three @entity141 dollars on the margin on a barrel of oil over the next three years			0
this would mean that the operation would provide ' attractive returns ' throughout the market cycle			0
the company said : ' in the @entity5 , work is well under way on various projects aimed at increasing margins at our stanlow refinery following its acquisition at the end of july 2011			0
' @entity133 is operating in a tough @entity144 refining market , but we continue to see signs that uneconomic refining capacity is being removed from the market which we expect to have a positive impact on margins			0
' @entity133 , which supplies @entity178 airport with jet fuel , saw supplies disrupted earlier this month , leading to some flights being delayed			0
the group saw profits slump nearly two - thirds to 129 million @entity141 dollars ( £ 82.7 million ) in the 15 months to march 31 compared with the previous 12 months .			0

there were three arrests at the @entity28 in @entity10 where at least 200 workers will lose their jobs this week
members of the picket line tried to blockade the site before trouble flared
