the @entity1 @entity0 heard oral arguments tuesday in the case of a hobby - supply store whose owners say the @entity7 is forcing them to act in contradiction with their @entity10 faith			1
@entity11 , a chain of 600 craft stores with more than 13,000 employees , took the @entity15 administration to court because it could face fines of $ 1.3 million per day – almost $ 475 million per year – if it fails to offer its workers a health insurance plan that includes a list of 18 contraceptives that the federal government deems ' essential			1
' four of those contraceptive methods , @entity11 's founding ceo @entity23 believes , can end a human life because they prevent the implantation of a fertilized human egg into a woman 's uterine lining			1
they include intrauterine devices ( iuds ) and the so - called ' morning after ' pill			0
but the federal government contended tuesday that those products are n't forms of abortion at all			2
@entity66 said that argument was irrelevant because federal law does n't see ' emergency contraception ' as equivalent to an abortion , and it does n't matter whether the @entity23 family disagrees			2
' people are saying that we are taking rights away from somebody , and there 's no way we are taking anybody 's rights away , ' @entity23 said in a @entity89 video produced last month to drum up public support for his case			2
' it 's our rights that are being infringed upon to require us to do something that is against our conscience			0
' if @entity23 were to opt out of @entity7 and send his employees to government exchanges for their coverage , @entity11 's penalties would be about $ 26 million per year			1
that option is a viable one , two @entity0 justices suggested during oral arguments on tuesday			0
@entity103 and @entity104 grilled @entity105 , the company 's lawyer , saying that since the @entity7 provides the option to pay a tax instead of complying , the @entity108 's religious protections are n't at issue			1
@entity105 , a @entity1 solicitor general in the @entity114 @entity113 , said the company wants to provide its employees with health insurance , but also wants to avoid offering a narrow range of contraception options			1
@entity104 has emerged as the chief critic of @entity11 's position			1
according to a report from @entity123 , she complained that giving the company an exception to the @entity7 law would signal to other companies that their own peculiar religious objections were fair game			1
' everything would be piecemeal , ' @entity104 said			0
' nothing would be uniform			0
' and , she said , a victory for @entity11 would make ' religious objectors come out of the woodwork			1
' @entity105 argued that the @entity15 administration has already carved out exceptions for religious organizations like churches , and hospitals run by religious denominations			1
extending it to devout @entity10 who express their faith through their businesses , he said , is a logical step			0
the @entity11 craft - store chain is at the center of a @entity0 battle over president @entity15 's health care law most of the @entity0 justices seemed cool to the @entity15 administration 's arguments on tuesday , according to published eyewitness reports -- including justice @entity68 , a likely swing - vote two female justices questioned on tuesday whether a private employer can control which contraceptives his female employees can access , but @entity11 's attorney said no one as prohibited from buying birth control on their own -- and suggested that the government could allay its own fears by paying for it ' we believe that the principles that are taught scripturally are what we should operate our lives by , and it actually flows over into the business , ' @entity11 president @entity165 said in the same video that featured his brother @entity173			1
' this is an issue of life			0
we can not be a part of taking life			1
' the question of whether a commercial corporation has the same religious - expression rights as a church or a religious - affiliated group is a thorny one			0
' @entity108 protects the rights of an individual to freely practice his or her religion , ' said @entity187 sen. @entity186 on tuesday , ' but i take issue with the notion that for - profit corporations are capable of religious belief			1
' @entity1 sen. @entity193 is among the liberal lawmakers who see the @entity11 case as an assault on women 's access to contraceptives , although conservatives point out that women who work for objecting companies can still buy the products cheaply on their own most of the justices on tuesday appeared skeptical of that position , according to eyewitness reports in major media			1
political tensions run throughout the @entity11 case , which has also been joined by a @entity209 company , @entity208 ' the president has given [ @entity7 ] exemptions for political reasons , ' argues @entity214 @entity213 rep. @entity213 , ' but is choosing to lay job - killing fines on those that believe in protecting the sanctity of life			1
in @entity1 , being a job creator should not mean you can no longer live and work according to your beliefs			2
this is not equal treatment under the law			0
' the @entity228 are a particularly religious family , even by the standards of their native @entity61			0
@entity165 is the driving force behind a national @entity232 , a $ 50 million project slated to open in @entity42 in early 2017 / the project 's stated purpose is ' to bring to life the living word of @entity238 , to tell its compelling story of preservation , and to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the bible			2
' but the @entity228 ' beliefs , say dissenters , are n't necessarily shared by their employees			0
' here the 13,000 employees of the @entity11 corporate enterprise are n't and should not be expected to share the religious beliefs of the @entity228 , ' former @entity250 administration solicitor general @entity248 told @entity254			1
' what you really have is one family attempting to utilize their economic leverage to impose their religious beliefs on others			0
' @entity11 founder @entity23 ( @entity263 ) and his wife @entity264 ( c ) are feeling positive about a legal fight that has become a major focus in the ongoing fight over the @entity7 @entity268 of @entity269 , @entity270 , wore a birth control pills costume as she protested in front of the @entity0 ( the @entity11 lawsuit involves the company 's objection to iuds and abortion - causing drugs , but not contraceptive pills			1
) @entity105 countered with outrage that ' the federal government for the first time has decided that they are going to force one person to pay for another person 's not just ... hip replacement , but something as religiously sensitive as contraception and abortifacients			2
' and , he pointed out , the @entity228 are not ' taking action to prevent their employees from getting these devices if they want to do it with their own money and on their own time			0
' asked by justice @entity293 during oral arguments whether there would be other contraceptive choices available to @entity11 employees if the company should prevail on the short list that it objects to , @entity105 replied , ' there are ample [ options ]			2
' former @entity114 administration solicitor general @entity105 argued on @entity11 's behalf that since the @entity15 administration has given religious institutions like hospitals a way out of the @entity7 law 's contraception mandate , it must follow suit for private - sector conscientious objectors the @entity228 have a recent federal law on their side : the 1993 @entity314 , which passed by landslide votes in both houses of @entity317			1
the law says that the federal government must show a compelling reason – on constitutional grounds – before it overrides a citizen 's religious liberty , even with a law that applies broadly to everyone			1
and even if the government establishes a constitutionally critical reason to disregard some @entity1 ' rights to practice their religion , it must do so in the least restrictive way possible			2
@entity333 @entity332 sen. @entity332 argued in a brief to the @entity0 that the @entity314 is a ' super-statute , ' intended to apply to the whole of @entity1 society including both nonprofit religious groups and for - profit companies			1
@entity341 @entity340 sen. @entity340 joined in the brief			0
he said tuesday that ' @entity7 is a thumb in the eye to our @entity344 ’s protections of religious freedom			2
the @entity1 ought to be the last country on earth where people of faith are forced by their government to defy their religious beliefs			2
' ' i am glad these cases are now before the @entity0 and am hopeful the court will find this administration has reached too far			0
' but @entity357 are pushing back , framing the @entity7 as too important to erode , even on @entity108 grounds – and accusing @entity11 of practicing illegal discrimination against women			1
' there are those out there who would like the @entity1 public to believe that this conversation is anything but an attack on women ’s health care , ' @entity42 @entity187 sen. @entity193 said in a prepared statement			0
' to them , it 's a debate about " freedom , " except of course the freedom for women to access care			0
' pro-life activists supporting @entity11 prayed outside the @entity0 on tuesday -- they fear that private employers will be forced to buy insurance for their employees that includes coverage for so - called ' abortifacient ' drugs ' my hope , ' she said , ' is that the @entity0 realizes that women working for private companies should be afforded the same access to medical care , regardless of who signs their paycheck			1
we ca n’t allow for - profit , secular , corporations or their shareholders to deny female employees ' access to comprehensive women ’s health care , under the guise of a " religious exemption			0
" ' access is n't the issue , countered @entity403 , the health policy director of the right - leaning @entity405			0
' these cases do not represent a conflict between religious employers and female employees , ' @entity406 said tuesday			0
' women have been and will continue to be free to seek out and purchase the contraceptives of their choice			0
' outside the @entity0 , @entity214 @entity415 sen. @entity415 spoke to a small group @entity11 supporters , organized by tea party groups , who ventured out into a late march snowfall			0
' the first freedom in the @entity108 , ' said @entity415 , ' is religious liberty			2

the @entity15 administration *insists* that a private company ca n't have protected religious views that it forces on its workers
@entity11 's owners counter that @entity7 *tramples* on their right to practice their faith and avoid being *complicit* in the taking of life
a slew of @entity436 lawsuits have hit the courts , but this one is narrowly focused and a victory would n't change the entire law
liberal experts fear that a *plaintiff* 's victory would open the *floodgates* to other private companies claiming exceptions to many other federal laws
conservatives say the @entity108 trumps the @entity113 's desire – and @entity317 's intent – to see as many @entity1 insured as possible
a *decision* , sure to be *controversial* , will likely come by the end of june
