eight - month - old @entity6 was running at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , when she spotted the bird and chased it before running straight off the cliff and plummeting into the sea			1
her terrified owner 47 - year - old @entity13 , from @entity8 , watched as her pet disappeared from view			1
@entity13 , pictured left with her dog @entity6 , feared the worst when she saw the eight - month - old disappear from view after chasing a bird over the edge of a cliff @entity6 fell 150ft off the clifftop after she chased a bird off the edge she feared the worst until another walker further up the cliff called to her that the tide was in and she could see the dog trying to swim to safety			1
mrs @entity13 frantically dialled 999 who put her through to the coastguard who then contacted the local lifeguard at @entity8			1
the stay - at - home mum of two said : ' it is incredible , it is a miracle			0
' she was n't even close to the edge but it all happened so quickly i did n't even have time to shout her name			0
' she is always chasing birds and crows but suddenly i just watched her disappear over the edge			1
' @entity6 has never been swimming before so i could n't believe she instinctively managed to get herself to safety			2
@entity6 ( pictured being rescued ) was running at @entity7 , in @entity8 , @entity9 , on saturday morning when she spotted the bird and chased it off the cliff ' remarkably the tide was not in completely so there was a small shingle area which she climbed out onto and sat on there			1
' the lifeguard was able to take his paddle board and hold @entity6 's collar as she sat on it and he brought her to safety			2
' my husband , @entity58 , wrapped her up in his big coat as she was shaking so much			0
' mrs @entity13 's husband and their two children , nine - year - old twins @entity60 and @entity61 , were beneath the cliffs playing with a kite when the accident happened on saturday			1
the family then took the dog to their local vets			0
mrs @entity13 said @entity6 was sitting subdued on her lap until another dog walked into the surgery when she started wagging her tail and jumped down onto the floor			1
mrs @entity13 said : ' the vet said it was a great sign as the next two hours after an accident are crucial			2
' animals can die of shock or have internal injuries			0
they observed her for a while and then checked her over			0
she did n't have a scratch on her			0
' her breath was slightly raspy because she had a small amount of water in her lungs which the vet said is not affecting her ability to breath and will pass through naturally			0
' a @entity8 lifeguard said : ' it 's not common but it has happened a few times			0
@entity6 was very lucky because the tide was in and i suspect she hit the water with quite a thud			2
lola with her owner @entity13 and her twin nine - year - olds @entity60 and @entity61 ' but it 's good to hear she survived and i 'm glad our team could help			1
' mrs @entity13 said : ' we do n't usually go walking on the cliffs and had only gone that day to use the kites			2
' now i know i will never take @entity6 for a walk on those cliffs again			0
i would never have forgiven myself if something had happened to her			0
