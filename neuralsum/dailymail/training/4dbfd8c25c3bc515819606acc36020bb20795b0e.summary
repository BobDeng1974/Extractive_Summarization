sources familiar with the video told @entity44 that @entity46 hits the @entity22 , propelling it into a hummer coming the other way			1
@entity46 then continues on and hits the prius			0

a video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by @entity56			0
according to previous reports , the @entity22 had been in @entity46 's path after coming to a halt when it hit a prius travelling ahead			2

a video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by @entity56 the video shows @entity46 rear - end the @entity22 and when the @entity22 clears his lane , his suv keeps moving and crashes into the @entity24 the @entity11 video is alleged to show that @entity46 hits the @entity22 , propelling it into a hummer coming the other way			1
@entity46 then continues on and hits the @entity24 the @entity74 family patriarch , who escaped the crash unscathed , took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision , which he passed			2
this latest evidence suggests that rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim 's @entity22 hitting the prius in front of her , @entity46 may have hit both cars , claims @entity44			1

@entity46 's @entity20 hit the back of the victim 's white @entity22 on the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , which caused a chain reaction that resulted in the luxury sedan veering into oncoming traffic an aerial view of the crash scene on february 7 shows the damaged cars , and police markings as they work to investigate the cause if it is determined that @entity46 's @entity20 struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely , it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction , @entity44 claims			1
investigations will determine if @entity46 , or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision , were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision			0

new video evidence could spell trouble for @entity46 following the four - car incident that left one person dead and seven injured in @entity8
footage taken by an @entity11 bus shows the 65 - year - old smash his @entity20 into the back of the victim 's white @entity22 and the @entity24 involved
most significantly the video - which is in police hands - shows that the @entity22 driver did *n't* make contact with the @entity24 involved
a reconstruction video of the incident makes a case that @entity46 was following too closely
if it is proved that he caused the fatal wreck , he could be charged with vehicular manslaughter which carries a six year prison sentence
