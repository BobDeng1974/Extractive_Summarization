by @entity0 a finalist in @entity2 ’s @entity4 competition might have to reduce his pride and joy to bricks and mortar – because he ’s been letting it out without the say - so of council chiefs			0
@entity11 , 61 , built the 80 sq ft shed out of recycled wood in his back garden in @entity14 , @entity15 , but it is much more than your average outhouse			1
inside it contains a table , gas hob , basin , shelves , seats and a bunk bed on a tiny mezzanine level			1
mr @entity11 explained : ‘ it ’s sort of a wibbly - wobbly shape and has a door that looks a bit like a flame and reminds people of pixies and fairies			1
but he may have to pull it down as he has been letting it without the council 's permission not just a shed : the interior contains a table , gas hob , basin , shelves , seats and a bunk bed mr @entity11 had been letting out the ' pixie grotto ' to holidaymakers keen to see @entity52 , an area of outstanding natural beauty in @entity15 @entity54 : the shed 's front door reminds people of pixies and fairies but the very same qualities which won it a place as a finalist in the annual competition might risk its future			1

creature comforts : the shed , which mr @entity11 has been letting out , contains a all the mod cons to provide a comfortable break mr @entity11 has submitted a planning application to @entity76 and hopes that he will not have to tear his creation down ‘ i did n’t set it out as a holiday let			1
i suppose i thought at the time , ‘ it ’s a shed ’			0
now he has applied for planning permission in a bid to sway planners – otherwise he will have to stop using the shed as holiday accommodation or risk having to pull it down			0
