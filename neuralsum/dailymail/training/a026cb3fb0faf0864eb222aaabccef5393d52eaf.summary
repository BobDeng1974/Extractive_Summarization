he 's the most famous @entity1 spy ever , whose iconic role can define an actor 's entire career			0
and while the likes of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 will forever be remembered for playing @entity10 , there will always be those who narrowly missed the cut as 007			0
but a newly - revealed photo archive has given a fascinating insight into the men who just failed to land the part as the smooth - talking secret agent			0
the final five : @entity18 , @entity19 ( top row , left and right ) , along with @entity22 and @entity23 ( bottom row , left and centre ) , all failed to land the @entity10 role ahead of one - time 007 @entity27 ( bottom right ) pictures from 1967 show five actors in a casting session for the @entity10 film , @entity34 , where the lead role eventually went to @entity27			1
the @entity38 actor , succeeding @entity7 who had just given up the role , landed the lead part in what would be his only @entity10 appearance			1
the history of the iconic spy franchise could have been very different , however , if one of the four other aspiring @entity45 had landed the coveted main role			1
ladies man : @entity22 , a @entity1 actor then in his mid- 30s , in a casting session for @entity34 , which was released in 1969 licence to thrill : @entity19 , who had previously appeared in @entity51 and @entity52 , also tried out for the iconic spy role shaken not stirred : @entity23 , who faded into complete obscurity after his failed audition , tries his best to channel @entity10 in this casting session picture the photos taken for @entity58 in 1967 show aspiring @entity45 suiting up , brandishing weapons , sipping 007 's trademark martini and charming beautiful women in his own inimitable style			1
among them is @entity1 actor @entity22 , who is pictured facing a gun from his female co-star in a typically ' @entity10 ' scenario			1
leading man : @entity27 , pictured with actress @entity69 , eventually landed the lead role for his only @entity10 appearance other fascinating images show another hopeful , @entity19 , alongside a love interest as he did his best to land the part of the suave spy			1
the third nearly - man is @entity23 , who competed for the role by screen testing in a trademark bond kissing scene with a female co-star			0
lastly is @entity82 , who , just like the others who failed to land the part , faded into relative acting obscurity following his rejection			0
@entity22 , a @entity1 actor then in his mid- 30s who had considerable film experience , was considered to be @entity27 's main rival for the role , but narrowly missed out			1
the actor , now 78 , appears to have taken the rejection in his stride , as he went on to appear in dozens of film in an acting career which spanned until 1994			0
the same can not be said for @entity19 and @entity23 , however			2
the former had a recurring role in @entity51 and later @entity52 in 1966 , but his acting career stalled after his failed @entity10 audition			2
@entity23 meanwhile , appears even more of an enigma , as virtually no information appears to exist about his acting credentials at all , other than his relation to brother @entity103 , the prolific tv actor			0
@entity104 in theory should have stood a decent chance of landing the big role , having already appeared in a @entity10 film as an uncredited control room technician in @entity110			0
he was also overlooked in favour of @entity27 , who said after landing the role : ' i 'm really looking forward to being @entity10 , for the bread and the birds			1
' leading ladies : @entity118 model @entity117 ( left ) and actress @entity119 were two of the female finalists for the role of @entity10 's love interest in @entity34 @entity27 is said to have been cast as @entity10 for @entity34 after impressing directors in a screen test fight scene			1
the @entity38 also saw off the competition after appearing at an audition in a @entity128 suit which had been ordered , but not collected , by his predecessor @entity7			0
the archive also catalogues the attempts of several female actors in trying to land parts opposite the famously womanising @entity10			2
the @entity118 actor and model was one of five finalists for a role in the 1969 film , along with other potential @entity10 girl @entity119 , who is also pictured in the @entity58 collection			0
bond through the ages : @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are three of the most memorable 007 actors from the franchise the blond @entity10 : @entity145 has become the latest actor to take on the role of 007 , having starred in the last two films , as well as the upcoming @entity149			2

five actors all had final casting session for role which eventually went to @entity27
@entity22 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity23 all tried and failed to land coveted spy role in 1967
@entity27 eventually landed part but it was his only ever @entity10 appearance
