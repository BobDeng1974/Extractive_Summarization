by @entity0 published : 16:41 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 16:42 est , 5 december 2012 court battle : judges at the @entity3 ruled in favour of a decision to stop a businessman carrying out piling work on his home on an estate owned by the @entity10 's a businessman has been banned from carrying out piling work in the basement of his home in an exclusive @entity16 street after taking on one of @entity19 's richest landowners in court			1
@entity21 wanted to carry out the work as part of plans to extensively develop the basement in his home on @entity28 , but was denied permission by the @entity10 's @entity30			1
the @entity31 argued that the work would cause ' significant nuisance to the neighbours and nearby residents ' and was ' likely to damage neighbouring properties '			0
unhappy with the decision , mr @entity21 took his fight to @entity16 's @entity3 but today failed to get the @entity30 's decision overturned			1
judges dismissed his argument that the @entity31 had taken the ' wrong mental attitude ' towards him and let ' animus ' cloud its judgement			2
mr @entity46 had gained planning consent to modernise the property above and below ground last year after buying the house as a home for himself , his wife and their two daughters			0
but the hedge fund manager also needed permission from the @entity30 who gave the thumbs up to his above ground plans but refused to give the green light to plans for the home 's basement			1
his company , @entity65 , was also refused permission to carry out piling work - a prerequisite for any future basement extension			2
lawyers argued that consent to the piling had been ' unreasonably refused ' by the estate and that the works were essential to make the property ' future proof ' and keep open the option of developing the basement at some point in the future			0
@entity80 vehemently denied claims that it had not always followed ' best practice ' in the past and that it had ' deliberately sought to hide away the piling details in the documents in the hope or expectation that @entity31 would not notice them '			0
appeal : @entity21 lost his appeal at the @entity93 and @entity94 while judge @entity95 dismissed @entity80 's claims that the plans had been refused due to ' animus ' or a ' wrong mental attitude ' on the part of a senior @entity31 employee , he also said that criticisms of mr @entity21 ' holding company were unjustified			1
despite expressing ' some sympathy ' for mr @entity21 ' frustration at the lack of approval , the judge ruled that the @entity31 had been entitled to withhold consent due to the ' significant additional disruption ' to neighbours the work would entail , in terms of dust , noise and extra time taken to complete the job			2
he added that the piling work was not necessary for the above ground project			0
homes in @entity28 have been known to sell for as much as Â£ 5million .			0

judges ruled that the @entity10 of @entity10 's @entity30 was entitled to turn down @entity21 ' plans for a basement extension
the hedge fund manager had taken his battle with the @entity31 to @entity16 's @entity3 after claiming @entity127 had taken the ' wrong mental attitude ' towards his plans
