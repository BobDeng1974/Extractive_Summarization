this , ultimately , will be a day that @entity1 wishes to forget but for @entity3 , it will be a day that he will always remember			2
@entity3 , 20 - years - old , made his @entity5 debut for @entity6 on saturday , producing an assured performance at the heart of the back four that belied his tender age			1
a local boy , @entity3 has been on @entity6 's books since the age of 8 and saturday lunchtime marked the culmination of twelve years of dedication as he was handed a start by @entity1 in the absence of @entity20			1
@entity3 began the match with confidence , switching the ball 50 yards onto the toe of @entity50 and his composure in possession proved to be one of the hallmarks of an impressive showing			2
@entity3 executed more passes than any of his team - mates - 90 in total - and also had the best accuracy , with 93.3 % of his attempts successfully reaching a @entity6 player			1
he also won all three of his aerial duels			0
young talent : @entity50 also started for @entity6 before he was hauled off injured in the first half a crunching tackle late on , perhaps out of frustration , earned him a yellow card but that was the only blot on his copybook in a remarkable individual showing at @entity69			0
@entity6 are expected to seal the signature of @entity71 from @entity72 and would like to add @entity73 from @entity74			0
that may stiffen the competition but in @entity3 , @entity21 will know that he possesses a young , @entity78 defender who could yet play a significant role this season .			0
