with record snowfalls and icy temperatures , ski resorts across @entity1 are booming			0
but these haunting images show that while tourists may be flocking to some resorts , others can lay abandoned and in a few short years become overgrown as nature reclaims the mountain			2
the @entity11 hotel , in @entity12 , @entity13 , was once a booming holiday spot , but after going bankrupt four years ago , it has fallen victim to its surroundings			1
the hotel had its own snow - making machines , multiple swimming pools , as well as a golf course and tennis facilities for those visiting in the warmer months			0
a 1984 advert for the @entity11 , which was built in the 1960s , shows people enjoying the slopes , as well as taking a dip in the pool and dancing with friends after a hard day 's skiing			2
' more than a ski hill , ' the voice over boasts			0
' all that seems a far cry away now : squatters and damp have taken their toll , and nature has crept back in			0
urban explorer , known only as @entity63 , has captured these eerie images , showing the abandoned site , where empty chair lifts swing above grassy slopes and restaurants remain set for a dinner that will never appear			1
the swimming pools are no longer filled with clear water , but plant life , dust covers every inch of the once - popular hotel and the only reminder of the 21st century comes from two abandoned chip and pin machines			1
but it may all change yet : it seems there was hope for new life at the @entity11			2
overgrown : the pools which generations of visitors enjoyed jumping into are now home to the mountain 's plant life broken : windows across the building have been smashed , adding to the feeling of neglect which permeates the area @entity95 covered : it seems no one even bothered to sell off the furniture when the hotel and ski resort closed in 2011 modern : the only hint the pictures give to its recent past are these two chip and pin machines , also abandoned at the @entity11 a group of developers has snapped up the property , announcing at the end of january it would get a new name : @entity110			1
speaking to the @entity112 last year , businessman @entity111 suggested the resort would need $ 5million to $ 7million ( Â£ 2.525million to 3.675million ) to bring it back to its former glory			0
the developers have penciled in an opening date of july 1 ( @entity117 ) for the new , revitalised resort - complete with yoga studio and spa , and rebuilt golf course			1
however , the ski slope is not going to be bought back as it was decided they were no longer financially viable			0
new life : but there is hope for the future of the @entity11 : after years being left to rot , new developers have moved in to transform the site millions : the total cost of renovations to bring it up to scratch was somewhere between $ 5million and $ 7million hope : the developers are confident they can bring customers back to the resort - but it does n't seem they will be reintroducing the ski lifts date : the developers are hoping to open up once more on july 1 - which is @entity117 , a public holiday in the @entity1 country			1

the @entity11 hotel - a 1960s ski resort near @entity12 , in @entity13 - closed it doors in 2011 after *declaring* bankruptcy
the 200 acre site has been abandoned ever since , allowing nature to reclaim the once popular hotel
creepy new pictures show rusting ski chairs hanging over grassy slopes , and a dining room laid for dinner
but developers are now hoping to *inject* new life into the resort - *reopening* to the public later this year
