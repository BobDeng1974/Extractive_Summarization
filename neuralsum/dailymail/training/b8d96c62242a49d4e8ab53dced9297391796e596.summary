' it ’s an opportunity to take some time out , talk about how your day ’s been , it ’s time to regroup and re-energise			0
it ’s a feel good time - that ’s what i like , ' she said			0
aside from tea , the virtuous star , who cites her @entity84 's resolution as ' continuing to work on balance in all areas of her life ' , has long promoted a healthy diet and superfoods			2

' i also make my own superfood smoothie with maca powder , acai powder , spirulina , cacao powder , coconut oil and chia seeds , which is alkalizing and nutrient dense			2
' @entity105 is also great for skin health and i probably have half an avocado a day			0
' despite following a healthy diet , the svelte star and former @entity110 model admits that she allows herself to ' indulge ' and ' does n't deprive herself '			2

for an everyday treat , i cook gluten - free muffins with blueberries and chia seeds			0
' she complements her balanced diet with a serious fitness regime , saying she likes to keep active and do some form of exercise every day			0
' it ’s a combination of either yoga , pilates , resistance training or something with my son such as hiking or riding our bikes			2
i also like jumping on the little mini trampolines too ; it ’s a really good way to stimulate the lymphatic system and it lifts your mood , ' she said			0
the virtuous star cites her @entity84 's resolution as ' continuing to work on balance in all areas of her life ' when she is n't modelling , designing tea cups or spending time with her son , @entity0 works on the project she 's most passionate about : her organic skincare line			1

@entity0 's tea cup range , inspired by her grandmother , features ornate flower and butterfly illustrations ' if i ’m travelling i like to have my @entity179 packed too			1
i remove my make - up and apply the rosehip oil , it really revitalises , hydrates , brightens and protects the skin it because it ’s packed with antioxidants , ' she said of her must - have			2
@entity0 , who covered the february issue of @entity189 , ensures she finds time to relax in between her hectic schedule and has previously explained that she books chunks of time off to unwind			1
so how does the world 's busiest woman relax ? ' having a laugh with friends and family is really important , ' she said			0
' other simple things like reading a book to my son really help me relax			2
or enjoying the sunset , being in nature , taking my shoes off and putting my feet in the grass , having a fresh bouquet of flowers , having a cup of tea , lighting a candle , having a bath , these things make me feel really happy			1
