by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 survived the first big test of his nerve at @entity5 in spectacular style to set up the most glorious chance he will surely ever have to win his first @entity8			1
there will be plenty more challenges to overcome on the back nine on sunday , but the way @entity2 swatted away the challenge of @entity13 with an eagle at the par - five 16th hole and then another at the 18th was the stuff of the greatest major champions			1
@entity2 will now take a six - shot lead into the final round of @entity8 after carding 68 on a day when @entity8 was played for the first time in its 143 - year history with a two - tee start			1
the bold decision was made by the @entity24 following forecasts for saturday afternoon of electrical storms , but these never materialised and , bizarrely , everything was wrapped up before 4pm			0
his nearest challenger is @entity13			2
for so long on saturday it looked like it would be @entity2 vs @entity13 going toe - to - toe in the final round at @entity5			1
but now @entity2 has a cushion that should allow him to relax and seal his third major title			2
@entity13 got within two shots of @entity2 ’s lead after a blockbuster front nine of 32 strokes and the pair were tied at 12 under on the 12th and 13th holes			1
@entity2 pulled clear at the 16th when he smashed a stunning two - iron to 20 feet and drained the putt			2
@entity13 , meanwhile , bogeyed the same hole and the lead was suddenly five shots			2
contender : @entity65 @entity13 is six shots adrift of @entity2 weather warning : electrical storms were forecast for saturday afternoon but they never materialised @entity2 dropped a shot on the next but no matter			1
another stupendous long iron pitched on top the front of the green and rolled to within 10 feet of the pin for another eagle chance			0
there was no mistake with the putt			0
even in his pomp , @entity29 could not have done it better			0
@entity13 shot 68 to sit one stroke clear of @entity82 and @entity83			1
but surely a third leg of a career grand slam in majors will follow for @entity2			0
woods , meanwhile , continued to struggle on his return to major competition following serious back surgery in march			0
the 14 - time major champion shot a 73 to sit three over and in 58th place			0
if @entity2 continues to play in such imperious fashion , the biggest threat to @entity97 ’s major record might come from someone other than @entity29			0
hats off : could @entity82 mount a challenge on the final day at @entity5 ? struggle : @entity29 , the 14 - time major champion shot a 73 to sit three over and in 58th place			1

@entity2 carded two eagles and a *birdie* in his final three holes at @entity5
@entity39 is now 16 under par for the *tournament*
@entity65 @entity13 and @entity112 @entity82 head rest of field
