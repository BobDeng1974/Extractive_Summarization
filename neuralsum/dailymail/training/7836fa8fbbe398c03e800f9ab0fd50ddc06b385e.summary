by @entity0 threats : the escalation of strike action comes as the rift with education secretary @entity5 deepens militant teachers yesterday announced a major escalation of strike action which is set to close thousands of schools this term			1
members of the @entity12 will walk out on july 10 as a bitter rift with education secretary @entity5 deepens			1
they will be joined by union members who work in education and local government as @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 plan to co-ordinate industrial action			1
the strike misses the gcse and a-level exam season			2
in march , a national strike by the @entity12 forced the closure of 3,000 schools and pushed thousands more on to reduced timetables			1
@entity12 general secretary , @entity29 , last night accused the government of failing to make progress in their dispute over teachers ’ pay , pensions and workload			1
she claimed mr @entity5 ’s education reforms are damaging the teacher profession and making it a ‘ totally unattractive career choice ’ which will ‘ most certainly lead to teacher shortages ’			1
but in an angry exchange of words , the @entity44 insisted there was ‘ no justification ’ for further strikes as @entity12 talks with ministers remain ongoing			1
it also challenged her portrayal of teaching as being an unappealing profession			0
a @entity44 spokesman said : ‘ in fact , teaching has never been more attractive , more popular or more rewarding			0
‘ a record number of top graduates are now applying to become teachers and there have never been more teachers in @entity65 ’s classrooms , with a rise of 9,000 in the last year			0
’ he added : ‘ further strike action will only disrupt parents ’ lives , hold back children ’s education and damage the reputation of the profession			2
’ the @entity12 ’s campaign is aimed at challenging performance - related pay , changes to pension rules and tackling ‘ excessive ’ amounts of work			1
the new system of performance - related pay has brought automatic pay rises to an end , with schools given the flexibility to offer higher salaries to the best teachers			0
head teachers can deny pay rises to staff who fail to improve exam results , demonstrate pupil progress , maintain discipline or opt out of extra-curricular activities			0
the @entity12 claims the new system is ‘ unfair ’ and will lead to pay cuts for many because of budget constraints			1
changes to pensions would make them less generous and mean teachers retiring later			0
ms @entity29 said : ‘ this ( strike ) action is the responsibility of a government and @entity5 who are refusing point blank to accept the damage their reforms are doing to the teaching profession			1
‘ strike action is a last resort for teachers and we deeply regret the disruption it causes parents and pupils			2
this date has been chosen to cause minimum disruption to examinations			0
‘ teaching is one of the best jobs in the world but is being made one of the worst under @entity5 and the @entity126			1
’ criticism : @entity29 , the @entity12 general secretary , has accused the government of failing to make progress in their dispute over teachers ¿ pay , pensions and workload the @entity135 joined the @entity12 in regional strike action across the country last year but did not take part in the march walkout due to mr @entity5 agreeing to talks			1
last year , mr @entity5 told teachers they have never had it so good and accused union leaders of peddling the damaging falsehood that teaching is a ‘ depressing and demotivating activity ’			2
referring to the @entity12 and @entity135 , he said : ‘ the picture these union leaders paint is of a profession which no one rational would want to join – a profession which is unattractive , unrewarding and unfulfilling			2
‘ the truth , however , is very different			0
teaching , as a profession , has never been more attractive , more popular or more rewarding			0
’ in march , about one in eight schools in @entity65 were forced to close fully due the @entity12 walkout , according to @entity128 estimates , but it is thought that many more were partially shut			2
@entity157 , @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 were yesterday named and shamed by the @entity44 as being among the worst places in @entity65 for gcse results			0
secondary schools in 17 areas fail to ensure the majority of their pupils get five a * to c grades including the core subjects of @entity65 and maths			0
@entity44 statistics show that the worst area in @entity65 for gcse results is @entity157 , where only 45 per cent of pupils leave school with a set of decent qualifications .			0
