by @entity0 published : 15:53 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 04:31 est , 25 november 2013 the world 's longest commercial flight completed its final 9,534mile journey from @entity4 to @entity5 this weekend			1
@entity6 had been running the grueling near - 19 hour flight since 2004 , but finally decided to pull the journey from its schedules reportedly because it was becoming too expensive to run			1
the route , best known as @entity11 , has been taken out of service weeks after a route linking @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity5 was ceased by the airline in october			1
no more : @entity6 has decommissioned the world 's longest scheduled commercial flight which linked @entity19 in @entity4 with @entity20 in @entity5 @entity6 , which announced the decision to stop the routes in 2012 , says that the decision was made because it is selling its gas - guzzling a340 jets back to @entity25 in exchange for new @entity27 which are n't designed for such long flights			1
but reports suggest that the increasing cost of fuel has meant that the route , between @entity19 and @entity20 , is no longer profitable			1
now that the @entity5 to @entity4 route has been taken off schedules , what are the top ten longest commercial flights ? according to @entity40 , the price of a barrel of fuel stood at around $ 28.88 ( £ 17.82 ) when the route first took off			2
but the price of the same amount of fuel has shot up to around $ 107 ( £ 66 ) today			0
the route , which flew over the @entity46 , set travellers back between $ 6,000 and $ 8,000 ( £ 3,700 - £ 4,936 ) return and was popular with bankers flying between @entity50 and @entity5			2
but passengers got business class luxury travel for the price of their ticket			0
the planes only seated up to 100 passengers , all in business class , with seats measuring 36 inches wide - twice the width of a standard plane seat			0
each seat had its own 15 inch television screen and a vast film library of 243 titles to choose from , 358 television shows , an 800 cd library , 22 radio stations and 80 video games to keep them occupied on the long journey			0
other airlines operate the same plane with about 250 seats in first , business and economy classes			0
the non-stop route saved travellers around three hours when compared to a journey including a stop - off elsewhere			2
instead travellers wishing to go between @entity4 and @entity5 will now have to stop at @entity80 , @entity81			0
the longest commercial flight available to passengers now is between @entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity86 , @entity87 - a route which is 8,578 miles long and takes around 15 hours and 25 minutes			1
costly trip : the airline found the only way to make the routes profitable was by configuring the plane with 98 business class seats that sell for about $ 8,000 for a return ( file picture )			0

the @entity6 flight linked @entity19 and @entity20
the grueling route , known as @entity11 , took almost 19 hours to complete
the longest route now links @entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity86 , @entity87
