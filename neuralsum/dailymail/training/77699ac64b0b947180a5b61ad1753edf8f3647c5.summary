more than 20 years ago a @entity1 farmer had an idea – to create a maze out of trees that would spell the words of @entity6 when seen from above			1
@entity7 chose a @entity9 verse , made a plan , then planted thousands of willows on a seven - acre field with the help of a few volunteers			1
as they grew he carefully pruned them so their message would be clear			0
the words , from @entity20 , begin with ‘ @entity6 ’ and read , with strategically - used @ signs : ‘ i am the way , the truth and the life			1
’ @entity7 has planted the trees so ' @entity6 i am the way the truth and the life ' can be seen from above sowing the seeds : the father of five planned how he would plant the trees on a computer first trees of life : mr @entity7 planted thousands of willows and has been mowing them for decades the father of five ’s dedication went largely unnoticed – bar a few comments from pilots – until it was spotted recently on @entity42			1
labour of love : the @entity1 created the design on a computer before marking it out on the ground mr @entity7 , 63 , pictured , who lives with his wife @entity48 and their dog peace near @entity51 , @entity52 , said : ‘ the idea just came to me one day			1
' i am not even sure why i chose that part of the @entity9 , other than @entity6 is saying a lot about himself in that passage			2
' in a way the maze is a lot like life , nobody knows what it looks like from above			0
' you can wander through life confused when in fact it does make sense from a different perspective			0
’ he only saw the words from above for the first time in 2005 when a police officer neighbour gave him a picture taken from a helicopter			0
‘ there are a couple of things i would do differently and some tweaks i would make but overall i am happy with it , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
he invites friends and people from the local church to use the maze , and there is a public footpath by the field so walkers can stumble upon his creation			0
mr @entity7 added : ‘ every time i see a plane go over i look at it and say a little prayer			2
i hope somebody sees the maze and feels inspired			0
’ friends and family use the maze and there is a public path on one side - but only the initiated know its secret strong belief : the farmer says he hopes someone in a plane above sees the message and is inspired by it perspective : mr @entity7 says the maze is like life , nobody knows what it looks like from above			1

@entity116 message reads : ' @entity6 i am the way , the truth and the life '
@entity7 had the idea in the *1990s* and has now made his *dream* *reality*
the thousands of trees take up seven acres of land
