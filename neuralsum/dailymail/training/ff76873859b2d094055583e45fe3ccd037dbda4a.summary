by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 18:02 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 17 september 2013 mind over metal : bands such as these are useless to arthritis sufferers , according to a new study copper and magnetic bracelets worn to help relieve the crippling pain of arthritis are useless , scientists say			1
the healing effect that some users report is no different when wearing wrist straps made of any other material , according to the first scientific study into the treatment			2
magnetic and copper bracelets are said to help a variety of ailments , including the chronic joint pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders			2
manufacturers of the bracelets , which cost between £ 30 and £ 50 , suggest these conditions can be alleviated by rebalancing the body ’s magnetic field or topping up depleted copper levels through the skin			1
however , the research shows they were no better than a wrist strap that was not magnetic or did not contain copper			0
although previous research has cast doubt on the effectiveness of the bands , the latest trial , by @entity40 , is the first scientific study of its kind			1
it studied the use of copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps for pain management in rheumatoid arthritis			2
' devices such as these provide a placebo effect for users who believe in them , ' said dr @entity54 , a research fellow in the @entity55 at @entity40 , who led the study			1
' people normally begin wearing them during a flare - up period , and then , as their symptoms subside naturally over time , they confuse this with a therapeutic effect			0
' pain varies greatly over time in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , and the way we perceive pain can be altered significantly by the power of the mind			0
' seventy arthritis patients with active symptoms , aged between 33 and 79 , each wore four different devices over five months , reporting on their pain and medication use throughout the study , which was published in the science journal @entity79			1
@entity80 : scientists say that arthritis sufferers often mistakenly think that when pain subsides naturally after a flare - up , it is because of the magnetic bands they also provided blood samples in order to monitor any changes in inflammation levels			1
dr @entity54 said : ' people may be better off saving their money , or spending it on other complementary interventions such as dietary fish oils for example , which have far better evidence for effectiveness			0
' warning people who suspect they may have rheumatoid arthritis to consult their gp and seek early medical treatment , rather than placing faith in such devices , is also important in helping to avoid long - term joint damage resulting from uncontrolled inflammation			0
' his report concluded : ' the results of this trial fail to provide any support for belief in the anti-inflammatory effects of magnetic wrist straps and copper bracelets			0

@entity40 scientists tested a range of devices on 70 arthritis sufferers
but the bands , which can cost up to £ 50 , had no effect on their pain
study concludes patients are better off saving their money
