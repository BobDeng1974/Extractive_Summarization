@entity0 claimed a left - leaning pact between @entity2 , the @entity3 and the @entity4 would be ' possible ' if there is another hung parliament @entity0 yesterday opened the door to a ' rainbow coalition ' of @entity2 , the @entity3 and the @entity4 following the @entity9			1
the business secretary went further than any other senior @entity12 politician as he claimed a left - leaning pact between the three parties would be ' possible ' if there is another hung parliament			1
labour leader @entity17 has played down the prospect of a deal with the resurgent @entity4 , but mr @entity0 insisted there is ' no taboo ' on the @entity22			1
however , he said whichever party has the most seats at @entity12 should have the first opportunity to form a government			0
he went on to condemn recent remarks from first minister @entity28 , who said she would prop @entity2 up in @entity29 even if the @entity30 win the election			2
mr @entity0 was one of the key figures when the current @entity34 / @entity3 coalition was formed in 2010 , but has remained a critic of the conservatives and is frequently tipped as his party 's next leader			1
in recent years , @entity2 has courted mr @entity0 in the hope of forming a coalition with the @entity3 after may 's election , and mr @entity17 revealed in 2012 that he was in regular text message contact with the cabinet minister			1
but polls suggest the @entity3 face an election drubbing , particularly in @entity46 , and the @entity4 could emerge as the third largest force in @entity49 politics			1
miss @entity28 – who insists she will lead post-election negotiations rather than @entity51 – has ruled out any deal with the @entity30 , yet is willing to prop up mr @entity17 in @entity53			1
in return , she wants the replacement programme for @entity57 nuclear missiles to be scrapped , an end to ' austerity ' and sweeping new powers for @entity61 that critics fear would lead to ' independence by the back door '			0
senior @entity46 @entity65 are known to bitterly oppose the idea , but mr @entity17 has repeatedly declined to entirely rule out a post-election deal			1
any pact would most likely would be a ' supply and demand ' arrangement , ensuring budgets and other key pieces of legislation were passed rather than a formal coalition			2
speaking to journalists on a visit to @entity77 yesterday , mr @entity0 said : ' there is probably going to be an issue in the next parliament of minority government			1
we do n't absolutely know , it could go all kind of different directions			0
' when that happens there are all kind of different possibilities – coalition , support outside coalition - and i think any sensible party has to be willing to look at all those possibilities in an open - minded way			2
' what the country will need is stability , i do n't think the electorate will be at all well - disposed to any party – whether it 's one of the @entity49 parties or the @entity4 – which aims to destabilise the government and runs back to the electorate after a few months			1
' asked about @entity107 's claim that she would do a deal with @entity2 even if it was the second largest party at @entity12 , mr @entity0 said : ' we adopt a different approach – we think you have to show respect for the electorate			1
' you have to respect the principle that the party with the largest number of seats at @entity12 has a basic legitimacy			0
that 's where we started from in 2010			0
there 's no taboo on the @entity4			2
' the party we had the greatest degree of difference from were the @entity30 , but given the reality of the situation in 2010 – the need for a stable government , the extreme nature of the economic crisis – we worked together in a business - like way and we would approach the @entity4 in precisely the same way			1
' asked if a ' rainbow coalition ' with @entity2 , the @entity4 and the @entity3 is therefore a possibility , mr @entity0 replied : ' it 's possible			1
we 're not leaning in one direction or the other , we 're trying to be equidistant between the parties and leave the public to decide which direction they go , but certainly that kind of arrangement would be possible – i certainly would n't rule it out			2
' mr @entity0 insisted the @entity3 will not get wiped out north of the @entity156 , despite polls suggesting that chief secretary to the treasury @entity158 and women 's minister @entity160 could be out of a job			1
' i think we 'll get far more mps back than the polls are indicating at the moment , ' he said			0
' these average figures , which i know are quite low in @entity46 , do n't actually tell you the underlying trend about what 's happening in @entity170 or @entity171 or @entity172			0
i think the vast majority of our colleagues will get back			0
' [ for @entity158 ] it 's an uphill struggle			0
but he 's got a very high profile , he 's delivered a lot for his area as well as across the @entity49 , so i would include him in the category of people who when it comes to the crunch , people will look at the individual and their record as an mp and i 'm pretty confident we shall see them back			0
' labour leader @entity17 ( left ) has played down the prospect of a deal with the resurgent @entity4			1
mr @entity0 hinted at a ' rainbow coalition ' of @entity2 , the @entity3 and @entity191 's ( right ) conservative party the business secretary went on to criticise miss @entity28 's recent bid to delay plans to cut @entity49 's deficit and spend an extra £ 180billion over four years , in return for @entity4 support in the @entity199			1
' i 'm not sure that delay is a good doctrine in itself , ' he said			0
' you 've got to face the realities			0
' i think if [ the @entity4 ] did find themselves in government , they would find themselves making some very difficult decisions			2
any responsible government has to deal with very large deficits			2
' last night , @entity12 leader @entity209 said : ' a strong team of @entity211 will be a progressive force for change across the @entity49 , standing up for @entity46 's interests and an alternative to austerity focused on jobs , growth and fairness			0
' unlike the @entity3 , we have made clear that we will never help the @entity30 into government - and having played their part in inflicting devastating cuts over the last five years , the @entity3 must now answer to the electorate in may			2
' a spokesman for the @entity226 said : ' in every election since the 1930s the biggest party has formed the government			0
this election is about evicting @entity191 from @entity29 and only the @entity226 can do that			0
' a vote for any other party makes it get more likely that the @entity30 will be the biggest party , and @entity191 will get into government through the back door			0
