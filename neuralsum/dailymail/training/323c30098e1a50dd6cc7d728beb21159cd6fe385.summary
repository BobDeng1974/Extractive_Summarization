sir @entity0 said family courts must be exposed to the ' glare of publicity ' the country ’s most senior family judge yesterday launched a furious attack on social workers who failed to tell parents why their children were being adopted – and suggested that in future the same offence could carry a jail term			1
local authority workers in @entity14 ignored a court order requiring them to explain why the couple ’s two children were being taken for adoption			1
they only released the information to the parents 45 minutes before the decision was due to be finalised , giving the family no real hope of mounting a challenge in court			2
sir @entity0 , who is @entity26 , said their behaviour was ‘ deplorable ’ and ‘ symptomatic of a deeply rooted culture in family courts ’			1
in his judgment , he accused the social workers of having a ‘ slapdash ’ and ‘ lackadaisical ’ attitude to court orders			1
he said the couple , who were facing the ‘ permanent loss of two children ’ had been denied ‘ vitally important ’ information			2
he also warned that in future , there would be ‘ consequences ’ for social workers , suggesting that they could be jailed for contempt if they fail to comply with court orders – an offence that carries a sentence of up to two years			1
until now , local authority workers have largely been protected by family courts , which also routinely tolerate delays and inefficiencies in their work			2
by contrast , members of the public who have failed to comply with court orders have been dealt with severely			2
the most notorious case of this was the prison sentence for contempt handed down to @entity64 , who wanted to get her father out of a care home where she thought he was being ill - treated			2
miss @entity64 was jailed without representation and in secret until her case was revealed by the @entity70			0
but sir @entity0 ’s warning suggests council staff will now face the same punishment as ordinary members of the public if they fail – either through incompetence or unwillingness – to hand over the required information on time			1
he told the court : ‘ that the parents should have been put in this position is quite deplorable			0
‘ it is , unhappily , symptomatic of a deeply rooted culture in the family courts which , however long established , will no longer be tolerated			0
' the court is entitled to expect – and from now on family courts will demand – strict compliance with all such orders			0
notorious case : @entity64 , pictured , was jailed in secret for failing to comply with a court order ‘ non-compliance with orders should be expected to have and will usually have a consequence			1
’ he added : ‘ there is simply no excuse for this			0
orders must be obeyed and complied with to the letter and on time			0
non-compliance with an order , any order , by anyone is bad enough			0
‘ it is a particularly serious matter if the defaulter is a public body such as a local authority			0
‘ it is also a particularly serious matter if the order goes to something as vitally important as the right of a parent who is facing the permanent loss of their child to know what case is being mounted against them by a public authority			0
’ @entity123 mp @entity122 , who has campaigned for openness in the family courts , said : ‘ at least anybody who is sent down for contempt by sir @entity0 will not be locked up in secret			1
‘ he has put the boot on to the other foot			0
the next time courts are let down by the incompetence or bloody - mindedness of social workers , it will be a director of children ’s services facing jail rather than a parent			1

sir @entity0 attacked workers in @entity14 who did *n't* explain themselves
they did not tell a couple why their two children were being taken from them
they *breach* a court order in doing so - which could carry a jail term in future
