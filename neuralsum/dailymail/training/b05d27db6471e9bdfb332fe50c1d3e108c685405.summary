smartphones are being turned into ‘ pocket doctors ’ capable of spotting parkinson ’s disease			1
the popular devices come equipped with technology needed to record speech and movement – both of which are eroded by the condition , @entity4 ’s biggest science conference heard			1
the information can then be analysed and , it is hoped , used to diagnose the disease earlier and more accurately			1
more prompt treatment should improve quality of life			0
a patient ’s symptoms could also be tracked over time , ‘ revolutionising ’ treatment by allowing doctors to adjust drug dosage as needed			0
a new smartphone app can help diagnose @entity2 - suffered by @entity24 and @entity25 ( pictured ) - by recording speech and movement , both of which are eroded by the condition more studies are needed but @entity4 researchers have already shown they distinguish @entity2 ’s patients from healthy people with almost 100 per cent accuracy – and they are in negotiation about using the technology on the @entity36			1
some 127,000 @entity4 suffer from @entity2 ’s but with diagnosis based on symptoms , it is often not confirmed until relatively late			2
once it is diagnosed , fluctuations in the severity of symptoms make it difficult adjust drug doses			0
high - profile sufferers include @entity25 , who was just 30 when he was diagnosed with the condition , and @entity24			1
comedian @entity47 was in the early stages of @entity2 ’s when he died last month			0
symptoms include tremors , stiffness and a gradual slowing down of the body			2
as more and more brain cells die , speech and balance can be affected and some sufferers become wheelchair - bound			2
there is no cure but early treatment improves quality of life			0
the ‘ pocket doctor ’ , unveiled at the @entity65 in @entity66 , is simply a normal smartphone			1
@entity68 mathematician dr @entity67 has shown it is possible to use voice recordings to spot @entity2 ’s with 99 per cent accuracy			1
give - aways include soft , breathy speech and a tremor to the voice			1
the team has also used the phone ’s accelerometer - the inbuilt motion sensor that ensures the information on the screen faces the right way – to log movement			2
this is important , as @entity2 ’s patients often freeze while walking			0
dr @entity67 told the @entity65 in @entity66 : ‘ we have been able to show that if someone puts the smartphone in their pocket and walks forward 20 paces and back we can get very high accuracy – around 98 per cent or so – in detecting whether someone has @entity2 ’s			1
’ the actor @entity47 , 63 , pictured in july this year , was also in the early stages of @entity2			0
the scientists behind the new app say voice recordings can diagnose the disease with 99 per cent accuracy he hopes that if he can study enough people , it will eventually be possible to detect the disease in its early stages			1
dr @entity67 said : ‘ we do n’t know how to diagnose the disease until in essence it is too late			2
if we could get an advantage of even five years , that would be great			0
’ possibilities range from a program that is only used by doctors to an app that the general public can use , although the ethics of this would have to be examined			0
it is hoped the gadgetry found in smartphones could also be used to help spot other conditions , including alzheimer ’s disease , anxiety and depression			1
@entity127 of charity @entity128 , which is helping fund dr @entity67 ’s work , said : ‘ this research is a welcome step forward			0
' @entity2 is a very complex and fluctuating condition – so effectively managing it is a real challenge			0
‘ smartphones offer huge potential as they continuously capture information , and can monitor subtle changes - such as an increase or decrease in someone ’s tremor			2
‘ arming doctors and people with @entity2 ’s with this technology could revolutionise the way the condition is managed			0

*experts* at @entity68 said the ' pocket doctor ' makes it possible to use voice recordings to spot the disease with 99 per cent accuracy
@entity155 signs include soft , breathy speech and a tremor to the voice
the idea was unveiled at the @entity65 in @entity66
scientists said a person only has to walk for 20 paces with the phone in their pocket to get ' very high accuracy ' in diagnosis
