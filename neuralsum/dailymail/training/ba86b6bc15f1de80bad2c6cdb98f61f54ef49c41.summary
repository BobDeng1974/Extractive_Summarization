by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 14:43 est , 17 september 2012 @entity1 : @entity2 was given a community order after he pleaded guilty to attempting to spy on the @entity6 @entity5 swimming team in a women 's changing room a @entity1 was spared jail by a lenient judge today after being caught trying to spy on members of the @entity6 @entity5 swimming team at a training pool			1
@entity2 , 25 , was caught peering over the top of cubicles as members of the team were getting changed at a sports centre in @entity18			1
but a judge at @entity20 said he thought the public would be better protected from @entity22 by a community order rather than sending him to prison because it would guarantee he would go on a sex offenders ’ treatment programme			1
a previous hearing heard how a woman reported seeing @entity2 enter the changing room alongside members of the @entity6 team , who were training at the pool ahead of the @entity33			1
she made made a complaint after spotting him looking over the top of cubicles while they were changing			2
when staff at the centre went to find the 25 - year - old , he hid in a cubicle and tried to answer them in a woman ’s voice			1
he then came out and begged staff not to call the police before running away			0
@entity2 , from @entity47 , @entity18 , later handed himself in to police and pleaded guilty last month to trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence			2
the defendant was jailed for three years in 2009 after trespassing in a private home and he was found standing over a sleeping student , whose trousers had been pulled down			0
he also has convictions for voyeurism in 2005 and 2006			0
the court was told @entity2 was already on the sex offenders ’ register			1
@entity62 training facility at @entity63 was being used for training by the @entity6 @entity5 swimming team , but @entity2 was trying to spy on them getting changed today , the recorder of @entity18 , judge @entity68 , said the 2009 jail sentence was passed in the hope @entity2 would be sent on a treatment course but it never happened			1
@entity68 said sparing @entity2 from a jail sentence would guarantee he would attend a sex offenders ' treatment course giving him a three - year community order , judge @entity75 said this would guarantee he would attend the course			1
he said : ' i ’m satisfied it is on the public interest and long term interest of better protection of the public that i make a community order in your case today			0
' the judge barred him from entering any female changing area or toilet for five years			2
a judicial source familiar with the case said : ‘ sentencing guidelines allow that in cases of voyeurism , as opposed to someone filming sexual activity and making it public or posting it online , that community orders as opposed to custodial sentences are accepted			0
' with a custodial sentence you ca n’t mandate for a course of treatment whereas you can when a community sentence has been handed down			0
' the judge has used his power to ensure the defendant gets treatment			2
sentencing is to prevent reoffending as well as protecting the public and the sexual treatment course is a preferred course of action to a custodial sentence in some cases			0
’ at the last hearing , the judge queried if the case should be dealt with under special fast - track @entity5 rules			0
he said it was technically an @entity5 offence but there was no suggestion the defendant knew who the women were			0
@entity2 sat listening to the judge in the dock dressed in a grey suit and black tie , flanked by a security officer .			2

the 25 - year - old *locked* himself in a cubicle and put on a woman 's voice when *challenged*
