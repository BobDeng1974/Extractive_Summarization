by @entity0 , political editor published : 11:00 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 01:40 est , 28 september 2012 @entity1 found himself at odds with schoolfriend @entity3 yesterday over extraordinary claims that he snubbed a call from @entity6 to carry on a game of tennis			1
mr @entity3 , a member of the so - called ‘ @entity10 set ’ , caused turmoil at @entity12 by suggesting the prime minister had been too involved in a match at his country residence , @entity16 , to speak to the president			1
mr @entity1 flatly rejected the claims , insisting he and mr @entity3 had played tennis only once at @entity16 and official logs showed no calls from mr @entity6 at any time that weekend			1
on the back foot : the @entity13 playing an exhibition shot earlier this year			0
but did he really tell @entity6 to call back just so he could finish a set ? @entity25 said that officials always scheduled calls between the prime minister and the president in advance , with the @entity31 giving 15 minutes ’ notice even when mr @entity6 woke mr @entity1 up in the middle of the night to tell him @entity34 had been assassinated			1
the episode is particularly sensitive since relations between mr @entity1 and the racehorse trainer husband of former @entity39 boss @entity38 , have been in the deep freeze since the couple were arrested and charged over the phone hacking scandal			2
racehorse trainer @entity3 is an old friend of @entity1 's from their time as pupils at @entity46 mr @entity3 , who was at @entity46 with the prime minister , said in an interview with the @entity49 that the pair were ‘ pretty good friends ’			1
he went on : ‘ i played tennis with him at @entity16 one day			1
i won the first set easily , then he won the second set , and then someone came up to him and said , “ er ... mr @entity6 is on the phone for you , prime minister ”			0
‘ he said , “ i think we ’ve got time for a third set – tell mr @entity6 i ’ll ring him back			0
” he obviously thought he had me on the ropes , and i beat him two sets to one			0
’ mr @entity3 said that despite the hacking scandal , he hoped he would remain friends with mr @entity1 – who he said was known as the ‘ fat , noisy one ’ at @entity46			1
‘ we ca n’t see each other now , of course , but i ’m sure that will pass			0
’ a senior @entity25 source said : ‘ we are baffled			1
@entity3 has been to @entity16 on three occasions and there are simply no calls from president @entity6 logged around that time			1
‘ it is not the case that the president rings up on the off chance that the prime minister is free			2
calls are always scheduled by officials , even when there is an international emergency			0
there is an agenda and the prime minister prepares for the call			2
there has obviously been some misunderstanding because this account can not be true			0
’ another source said the one tennis match between mr @entity1 and mr @entity3 at @entity16 was on a saturday morning in august 2010			1
‘ @entity6 would have had to be calling in the middle of the night @entity94 time			1
’ mr @entity1 ’s links with @entity3 and mrs @entity38 came under scrutiny this year when it emerged that the @entity98 had lent the ex-newspaper executive a retired police horse			1
he was forced to admit he might have ridden the horse with mr @entity102			2
claims about @entity1 's tennis playing emerged today whole the prime minister was on a trade visit to @entity107			2
he arrived in @entity108 with a large entourage of 40 business men and women @entity113 ’s former spin doctor @entity112 suggested aides might pretend mr @entity6 was calling to give mr @entity1 an excuse to get out of a potentially boring meeting or social encounter			0
‘ we used to put blank post-it notes into @entity120 if he wanted to carry on a meeting , he ’d ignore them			0
if not , he ’d say , “ @entity123 ? now ? ”			0
’ @entity125 ’s biographer @entity124 said he remembered mr @entity125 doing something similar at a leaving party at @entity12 for his political secretary @entity128 , now mp for @entity129			0
he said : ‘ the prime minister was giving a generous speech when someone put a head round the door to say that the @entity31 was on the line			0
“ i ’ve always wanted to do this for you , @entity128 , ” said @entity125			0
“ tell them i will call them back ”			2

horse trainer @entity3 says his old schoolfriend refused to take a call from the @entity94 president because he had just pulled level in a tennis match at @entity16
@entity25 says it has no record of the call
