sir @entity0 has announced that he has set up his own cycling team in a bid to win gold on the track at the @entity5			1
the 2012 @entity7 winner has assembled a nine - man squad , composed entirely of @entity10 riders , and will be funded by @entity11 but known simply as ‘ @entity12 ’			1
sir @entity0 is launching a new cycling team for young @entity10 talent called ' @entity12 ' he is expected to make his debut for his new team in june when he tries to break the individual world hour record at the @entity18			1
‘ the whole idea of the team was to facilitate our ambitions for @entity5 and winning gold there , ’ @entity12 told @entity23			2
‘ it ’s track - based and we have got a lot of the guys from the track programme in there so that we can stay and race and train together all year round and get exactly what we need in terms of achieving the end goal , which is winning the team pursuit in @entity5			0
’ the team , endorsed by @entity38 , will be sponsored by @entity12 ' long - time support @entity11 the switch means @entity12 , who will be 36 by the time of the @entity42 and who has suggested he will retire afterwards , will not ride in the @entity7 again			1
@entity12 ’ new team - mates include the cream of @entity10 ’s young talent , such as @entity47 and @entity48 , as well as more experienced riders such as @entity50 and @entity51 , who should all be in the reckoning for the four - man team pursuit squad for @entity5			1
@entity12 has three medals — bronze , silver and gold — in this event from the @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , but the competition for @entity5 will be fierce , with no guarantee that he will make the final four			2
@entity12 , the @entity66 winner , says cycling has given him ' everything ' and he wants to give back ‘ it ’s not a given that @entity73 will be in the team in @entity5 , ’ @entity70 , @entity38 ’s technical director , said recently			1
‘ but when @entity73 gets a focus it ’s very hard to knock him off track			0
’ the four - time @entity79 champion , 34 , will continue to race for @entity11 , where he has had a fractious relationship with team - mate @entity81 , until april and his final outing will be at the @entity83			2
@entity12 , who was ninth last year , believes he can be the first @entity84 to win the tough one - day classic over the cobbles known as the ‘ @entity87 ’			0
‘ @entity38 has given me everything , ’ he said			0
‘ now i want to build something to inspire kids and to reach all those people who might be on the fringes of the sport			0
‘ my message is simple : if i can do it , then so can you			0
’ referring to his bid to beat @entity100 ’s individual hour record , @entity12 added : ‘ the next 12 - year - old might come along that may be inspired by watching the hour record like i was inspired watching @entity103 win the gold in @entity105			0
’ sir @entity0 was knighted by @entity106 at @entity107 in 2013			2

sir @entity0 will launch team ' @entity12 ' , sponsored by @entity11
