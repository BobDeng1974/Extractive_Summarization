for a man who had just made it to the @entity4 quarter - finals and broken the record for goals scored in @entity8 competition , @entity0 cut a frustrated figure as he left the pitch shaking his head on tuesday			1
the mood of the world 's best player had n't changed when he emerged from the home - team dressing room and told waiting television crews that he would not be talking again publicly until the end of the season			2
the significance of ' the end of the season ' is that by then we will know just how much a campaign that promised so much for @entity23 has delivered			2
@entity0 celebrates after scoring , but he could n't prevent his side slumping to a 4 - 3 defeat @entity0 vowed he would not talk publicly again this season after the defeat by @entity28 on tuesday @entity29 winner @entity0 watches on with his hands on his hips as @entity32 celebrates much more will also be known about the futures of @entity0 - @entity23 's top scorer — and also his team - mate @entity35 and his coach @entity36			1
supporters at the @entity38 turned on @entity36 even before @entity23 's 4 - 3 defeat by @entity28 had started , with the manager 's name jeered as it was announced before kick - off			1
@entity35 was whistled at in the second half while goalkeeper @entity45 also bore the brunt of the discontent , more justifiably because he could have done more about @entity28 's first two goals			1
when @entity45 , as captain , summoned his team - mates into the centre - circle at the final whistle they went reluctant — ronaldo more than most — but were met with more resounding boos and a show of white handkerchief protest			0
@entity45 has said he wants to stay until he is 40 but @entity23 want @entity58 goalkeeper @entity57 , and every day that passes without him signing a new deal at @entity61 leads them to believe they still have a chance			0
some @entity23 fans waved a white handkerchief after the final whistle on tuesday night @entity45 has been below his best for some time , but replacing him is not as simple as it sounds @entity45 called on his team - mates to acknowledge the home supporters following the surprise defeat @entity45 pulls midfielder @entity72 toward the centre circle to applaud the fans @entity58 will be watching the potential unravelling of @entity23 's season closely			1
the campaign could still end gloriously if important injured players like @entity79 , @entity80 and the fit - again @entity82 return to their best ahead of the @entity4 latter rounds			0
but what if things do n't end well ? @entity58 have made little secret of wanting @entity35 at the end of this campaign			0
he is happy in @entity90 but how many times can a player have his first mistake verbally chastised by his own fans before he starts to wonder if he might not be better off elsewhere ? the former @entity95 star is not a particularly social animal and has not put down any great emotional roots in the city			0
@entity58 must be encouraged by the fact that despite him winning four trophies in his first year at the club , supporters are doing nothing to cultivate a lasting bond			0
@entity35 was subjected to boos from @entity23 fans as they were beaten at home by @entity28 @entity35 has not scored for the @entity4 winners in his last nine appearances the former @entity95 player endured another night to forget as @entity23 were beaten but crept through @entity58 have also considered the impact that recapturing @entity0 would create			1
and they were interested in @entity36 before they turned to @entity115 to replace @entity116			0
the @entity117 stayed at @entity23 and won his third @entity4 but he is now drawn to the idea of an @entity121 return and the wheels have been set in motion to push his profile in @entity121 – not that anyone needs reminding how well he did at @entity126			2
no - one at @entity23 is suggesting @entity0 , @entity35 and @entity36 all park up at @entity61 this summer with @entity57 moving the other way but there is a sense that there will be an overhaul at the end of the season and with instability prevailing it might not just be squad players such as @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 who leave			1
at any club such rumblings would be dismissed as ridiculous but the knee - jerk short - termism at @entity23 is nothing new			0
@entity36 , pictured hugging @entity146 , is under growing pressure at the @entity38 @entity36 's future at @entity23 is the subject of discussion despite delivering the club their 10th @entity4 @entity36 looks to the skies as his side sneak into the last eight of the @entity4 an online poll asking which striker should be dropped from the ' @entity161 ' front three of @entity157 , @entity35 and @entity0 ( the one that was ' the best in the world ' just three months ago ) was carried out this week by @entity162			1
@entity35 registered 40 per cent and @entity0 33 per cent			2
@entity36 sticks up for both but no one sticks up for him			0
as he said earlier this week : ' when we win it 's got nothing to do with me , when we lose it 's my fault			0
' @entity170 on tuesday he was even asked if : ' knowing the business as he does , would he be surprised if he was sacked after defeat to @entity28 ? ' he has them in the last eight of the @entity4 in spite of an injury crisis ; @entity0 has already scored as many goals this season as last ; and @entity23 are only a win in next week 's @entity180 away from returning to the top of the league but you would never know it from the faces of those who were winning the @entity4 just 10 months ago .			1
