the @entity4 commander of @entity60 troops in @entity10 , general @entity58 , was forced to apologise over the claims that foreign troops had ‘ improperly disposed ’ of copies of the @entity51			1

the protests come as the @entity74 announced it has removed hundreds of pages of training documents that painted inaccurate or stereotypical views of @entity78			1
the counter-terrorism training materials referred to the @entity80 , the founder of @entity78 , as a cult leader and included graphs that implied devout @entity6 got more violent throughout history , while @entity84 and @entity85 became less violent			1
