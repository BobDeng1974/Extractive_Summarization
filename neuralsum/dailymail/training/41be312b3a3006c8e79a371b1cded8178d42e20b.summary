a disabled puppy dubbed ' the mermaid dog ' because her badly bent legs dragged behind her has been taken for a walk for the first time in her life after pioneering surgery			1
@entity9 , a 14 week - old @entity10 , was born with problems that affected her back legs , earning her the nickname ' the mermaid dog '			1
she either walked like a seal with her legs spread behind , or had her legs folded inwards under her body leaving her dragging her feet and shuffling her bum along the floor			2
once nicknamed ' the mermaid dog ' , @entity9 is now able to enjoy running and walking like any other dog			1
here she is pictured going for a run after her surgery , for which the back half of her body was shaved @entity9 , who was originally called @entity28 , was taken to a vet to be put down by a dog breeder , but the vet passed her on to an animal shelter			1
her new owners @entity34 , 57 , and wife @entity35 , 54 , fell in love with her after spotting her at @entity37 , @entity38			1
the couple spent £ 2,500 on pioneering surgery for @entity9 at the @entity41 in @entity42			1
surgeons had to use tweezers and small eye surgery tools to delicately fix @entity9 's knee joints as she is so small			1
she now has a new lease of life and is able to run around with the family 's other dogs @entity51 , a two year - old chihuahua cross yorkie , and @entity53 , a nine year - old yorkie cross @entity55			1
mr @entity34 , who works for @entity56 , said : ' when we saw her we just fell in love with her			0
' she dragged along her legs a bit like a seal			2
her knee caps were n't in the right place and her hips were funny and we just felt so bad for her			0
' she was n't in pain but she was very uncomfortable and she could n't bear any weight on her right leg			0
' @entity9 ( pictured ) , a 14 week - old puppy , was born with problems that prevented her from using her back legs but since her pioneering surgery - carried out with tweezers and eye surgery tools - she has been able to run and play like any other dog			1
here she is pictured on the right in the arms of her owner @entity77 mr @entity34 added : ' she used to drag her bum across the floor and that would also be uncomfortable			0
' we were absolutely thrilled to know she could be helped and though the surgery cost a lot it was worth it			2
' we were told the day after the operation she just stood up , it was incredible			0
' my wife @entity35 used to take @entity9 out in her coat while the other dogs were walked , but now she can join in			2
' now she charges around the house like a mad thing			0
she can play with @entity53 and @entity51 and though her legs still go slightly to the left they are more or less straight			0
' mrs @entity77 , a carer , said : ' her legs were like jelly , she just dragged them round in the position she got up in			2
' it 's amazing to see her be able to walk			0
we were told by one vet to think about putting her to sleep but we just could n't , and @entity9 proved them wrong			2
' @entity9 was already fixed at the rescue centre with splints which helped her build up the ability to walk			1
but the centre never thought a family would be kind enough to not only take on @entity9 , but fork out the cost for surgery too			1
her legs still veer slightly to the left ( as pictured on the right ) , but her condition is now significantly improved from when they were ' like jelly ' , owner @entity34 said @entity9 pictured having a nap after having gone for her first walk following surgery the @entity118 were told the surgery - which carried a 50 per cent success rate - would cost a whopping £ 10,000 , but orthopaedic surgeon @entity122 found a way of doing it for a quarter of the price			1
the delicate surgery , which involved filing a groove in her bones to help reset her legs and get her knee caps to sit properly , was the first time it had been carried out at the practice			1
@entity34 , who is dad to @entity132 , 33 , @entity133 , 30 , and @entity134 , 23 , said the pup was already walking on all fours when she was ready to return to their home in @entity139 , @entity38			2
@entity133 , a school teacher , said : ' a call to adopt her was put on @entity141 and that 's how we first found out about her			0
we called her the mermaid puppy			0
' she still needs some physio			0
we 're doing hydrotherapy with her , which makes her fur come out all fluffy - it 's adorable			0
' she may need hip surgery later , but for now she loves running about and we 're so happy to have her this @entity149			0
' the family are planning to fundraise for @entity9 's future hip surgery and are getting in touch with @entity153 to see if he can help			1
