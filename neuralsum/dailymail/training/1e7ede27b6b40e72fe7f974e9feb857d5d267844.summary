by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 01:44 est , 22 april 2013 two thirds of nurses think patients in their own hospitals are at risk of neglect , a report reveals today			2
bosses put financial targets ahead of patient care , according to three quarters of nurses , while a third say staffing is dangerously low			1
the findings of a poll of 8,000 nurses by the @entity17 comes just two months after a report into one of the country ’s worst hospital scandals warned a similar tragedy could happen again			1
neglect : a third of nurses claim that staffing levels are dangerously low an inquiry into @entity28 , where up to 1,200 died from neglect between 2005 and 2009 , described how patients were subject to ‘ inhumane ’ treatment because bosses prioritised targets ahead of care			1
and last month another @entity36 survey found that nearly 40 per cent of doctors and nurses would not want family members treated in their own hospital			1
the @entity17 says poor care is often caused by understaffing , and it is particularly concerned about shortages on elderly wards where many patients have dementia and need help with basic tasks such as eating and washing			1
in a separate poll , the @entity17 found that a third of 2,086 ward sisters and senior community nurses felt staffing levels were unsafe at least once a week			1
three quarters said they were potentially dangerous at least once a month while one in ten said they were rarely ever safe			2
@entity59 ’s plans for nurses to work for a year as healthcare assistants before their degrees are ‘ stupid ’ and risk setting the profession back a century , it was claimed yesterday			2
the health secretary wants to make it compulsory for student nurses to spend time carrying out basic tasks such as washing and feeding patients to prove they are capable of caring before going to university			2
but @entity71 , president of the @entity17 , said the policy was a ‘ waste of money ’			1
she added : ‘ it demonstrates the lack of understanding the government has regarding the requirements of modern nursing			0
it is a waste of taxpayers ’ money that will have no benefit to patients			0
it ’s a really stupid idea			0
’ critics also say the proposals lack crucial details , such as how the @entity36 could 21,000 extra student nurses each year , and who would assess them			2
general secretary @entity90 urged the government to introduce compulsory staffing levels to prevent needless patient deaths			0
he added : ‘ understaffing is the single biggest challenge facing the @entity36 today			0
‘ the introduction of mandatory safe staffing levels , enshrined in law , is now a matter of extreme urgency			0
mandatory staffing levels are proven to reduce patient mortality			0
the concerns of ward sisters are very clear , they do not have enough staff to always provide the high level of care they know all patients deserve			1
’ in february , a report into the @entity112 scandal warned that the failings could be repeated elsewhere			0
relatives of loved - ones who died saw confused patients wandering the wards in search of help or having to drink from vases because they were so thirsty			0
time pressure : @entity36 nurses spend 2.5million hours a week on needless paperwork but at the time the trust was desperately short - staffed and managers had axed more than 50 nurses to meet financial targets			1
mps and unions fear similar problems of neglect will arise as the @entity36 sheds thousands of nurses to save money			0
according to the latest official figures , the @entity36 lost 2,409 nurses last year , down from 372,277 to 369,868			0
but the number of unqualified healthcare assistants rose by 2,691 over the same period			0
some experts worry that hospitals are replacing better paid senior nurses with inexperienced staff on similar wages to cleaners			1
other figures compiled by the @entity17 show @entity36 nurses spend 2.5million hours a week on needless paperwork			1
more than half of the 6,387 who took part in the poll said the amount pointless admin had soared .			2
