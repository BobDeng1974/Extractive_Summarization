by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:35 pm on 6th january 2012 the @entity2 charged three of its cadets with sexual misconduct on thursday , including one accused of rape , just over a week after the government revealed a rise in reports of sexual assault at military academies			1
the three cadets all attended the @entity2 in @entity13 , @entity14 , but were involved in separate incidents over the past 15 months , the military said			0
cadet @entity16 , who faced the most serious accusations , was charged with rape , unlawful sex acts , engaging in an unprofessional relationship and conduct unbecoming an officer			1
serious charges : @entity2 cadet @entity23 ( pictured ) faces sexual assault and underage drinking charges			1
two other cadets face allegations @entity28 has three charges against him for allegedly raping a female cadet on one occasion and engaging in forced sex acts on other occasions , in all three instances using ' power or strength or restraint ' to prevent escape			1
the alleged crimes are especially egregious as he was one of the cadets who ran the honour system , which , according to the @entity45 , ‘ punishes those who lie , cheat , steal , or tolerate comrades who break the rules			1
’ the maximum punishment for such a violation is expulsion from the prestigious academy			0
cadet @entity49 , a senior , was accused of aggravated sexual assault on a woman while she was ‘ substantially incapacitated			1
’ riddled with problems : two other @entity2 cadets are charged with sexual assault and one with rape cadet @entity23 was accused of unbuttoning and unzipping a female cadet 's pants while she was incapacitated , the charging sheet said			1
he was also accused of underage drinking , abusive sexual contact and several instances of assault , which included an accusation he punched another cadet in the face			1
' sexual misconduct is a particularly egregious offense and we have a zero tolerance policy in the @entity2			1
we expect the best from our cadets , and do not tolerate unacceptable behaviours			0
' - colonel @entity75 colonel @entity75 , the @entity2 ’s vice superintendent said in a statement : ‘ the fact that the charges in all three cases are being referred at this time is due to the near simultaneous completion of each individual investigation			2
’ she added : ' sexual misconduct is a particularly egregious offense and we have a zero tolerance policy in the @entity2			2
‘ we expect the best from our cadets , and do not tolerate unacceptable behaviours			0
' the charges came after the @entity89 said last week that attacks at the three main military academies – @entity92 , @entity93 , and the @entity2 – rose sharply to 65 in the last academic year from 41 previously			2
incriminating reports : a week ago , the @entity96 military acknowledged a spike in sexual assault reports at military academies in september , the @entity100 had said the military needed greater leadership and oversight to prevent sexual harassment in its ranks			2
col @entity75 of the @entity2 says there is a zero tolerance policy for sexual misconduct col @entity75 said that while the three @entity14 cases were separate , the men were charged simultaneously because investigations in their cases were recently completed			2
the military did not reveal the ages of the men charged , nor were the women identified although some of them were described as female cadets			2
the charges were not the first instance of sexual misconduct accusations involving cadets			1
in 2003 , reports surfaced that dozens of female @entity2 cadets had been sexually assaulted by fellow cadets for a decade , but that academy officials ignored or downplayed their complaints			0
the fallout from that led to a shake - up in the academy 's administration following hearings before @entity134			0
according to the @entity45 , rape can bring the same punishment as murder under military law , though there ’s only a sliver of a possibility the death penalty would be administered			0
famous : the @entity2 's renowned chapel at sunset the next step in the three latest cases is an @entity149 hearing , which is the military equivalent of a civilian grand jury , the @entity2 said			0
the accusations against the cadets are deemed by the military as ' preferred charges , ' and the hearing will determine which if any charges are finally levelled against them and whether to move forward with court martial proceedings , @entity2 spokesman lieutenant colonel @entity155 told @entity160			0
all three cases will be dealt with separately , col @entity75 said , and are expected to begin later this month or early in february			0
sprawling campus : the @entity2 is located in @entity13 , @entity14			0

cadet @entity16 faces three charges of alleged rape and forced sex acts
cadet @entity49 accused of assaulting female cadet who was ' substantially incapacitated '
cadet @entity23 accused of abusive sexual contact , underage drinking , and unzipping female cadet 's pants
