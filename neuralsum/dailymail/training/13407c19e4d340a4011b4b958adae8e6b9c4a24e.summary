a gastric sleeve is one of the newer types of weightloss operations			0
the stomach is permanently reduced to about 25 per cent of its original size , by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach			0
the open edges are then attached together ( often with surgical staples ) to form a sleeve or tube with a banana shape			0
it may be appropriate for people who ca n't return as often for the follow - up visits required by gastric band procedures			0
a gastric band is a silicone band with an inflatable inner collar that is fitted around the upper stomach to restrict food intake , creating a small pouch and a narrow passage to the lower stomach			0
this passage delays the emptying of food from the pouch and causes a feeling of fullness			0
the band can be tightened or loosened over time			0

the 14 - year - old said : ' when i asked mum for seconds she gave in			2
i used to comfort eat because i was bullied			0
' by the age of seven , @entity6 was eating up to 3,000 calories a day - double the recommended intake for her age - and by the time she was nine she was a size 20 and weighed 13st			1
she added : ' my parents took me to see lots of doctors and nutritionists but nothing helped me lose weight			2
i was worried i was going to get so fat i 'd end up bedridden			0

her parents took her to see dr @entity25 , mrs @entity6 's second cousin , anxious that @entity6 might be suffering from depression and could develop medical issues such as diabetes and high cholesterol			1
dr @entity25 explained all young patients undergo a psychological evaluation to ensure they understand the implications of weightloss surgery			0
