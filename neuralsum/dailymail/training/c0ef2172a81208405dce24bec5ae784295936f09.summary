by @entity0 @entity1 loves her food ; whether it 's a sunday roast with all the trimmings or an @entity5 meal , she 's always happy to tuck in			1
but just five years ago , @entity1 , 29 , would have baulked at eating pasta , bread , pizza dough , potatoes and @entity11 puddings			1
why ? because , like thousands of others , she believed high - protein , low - carb regimes like the @entity15 or @entity16 diets were the most effective way to be slim			1
diet damage : @entity1 , left , broke a bone in her foot due to calcium deficiency while @entity22 , right , suffered migraines and dizziness during ten months on a low carb diet but , after cutting down on carbs so much that she would n't even eat dairy products as they contain lactose - a sugar - @entity1 believes she has permanently damaged her health			1
' i was only a size eight but found it hard to stay slim , ' she says			2
' then , when i was 22 , i saw a documentary about the @entity15 diet , thought it was great and cut most carbs out of my diet			1
' breakfast was an omelette , lunch was chicken with lettuce and dinner was something meaty with vegetables like kale , cabbage , sprouts or runner beans , which do n’t contain starch			2
' i got all the classic symptoms associated with a low - carb diet : dry mouth , tiredness , crankiness and bad breath			1
but i saw great results - my 8st 7lb weight was much easier to maintain			2
' unbelievably , @entity1 , a creative director in @entity59 , stuck to the regime for three punishing years			1
unbalanced : all protein and no carbs can upset the digestive system and cause muscle to be burnt for energy ' at restaurants , every meal had to be steak and salad , ' she says			1
' i 'd go to a friend 's house for dinner and if they 'd made pasta , i 'd eat a tiny amount , so as not to be rude , and end up feeling really ill - with chronic bloating and having to dash to the toilet			2
' i decided to come off the diet , and started eating normally , but the bloating became so bad i went to my gp			1
when he asked about my diet and i told him what i 'd been doing , he pretty much rolled his eyes and said that in simple terms , my body had stopped producing the enzymes i needed to process carbohydrates			1
' he said i 'd have to reintroduce around one or two grams a week very slowly , and gave me peppermint oil capsules to relieve the symptoms			0
for weeks i had stomach aches , bloating and kept going to the toilet			0
it was embarrassing and painful			0
' she adds : ' although i ’m better now , i have been diagnosed with @entity96			1
it only started during the low - carb regime			0
it 's effectively wrecked my health			0
' dr @entity101 , author of nutrition : a @entity103 , believes drastic no - carb diets like @entity1 's can damage digestion			1
i loved the results , but i was crying all the time because i was so hungry ' @entity109 in the bowel react very quickly to changes in the diet and the gut only has one way of complaining - through poor digestion , ' she says			1
' it should recover but can take a while			0
' it 's the quality of carbs you should focus on , not the quantity			1
cutting out processed foods , such as white bread , cake and pastries is good for reducing the risk of diabetes , but carbohydrates should n't be cut out all together			1
' a healthy diet should consist of low - glycemic index carbs from foods such as healthy grains , fruit and lots of vegetables			1
' @entity1 believes her diet had another damaging consequence			1
soon after she came off it , she broke a bone in her foot while out running and believes being deficient in calcium for months may have left her bones vulnerable			1
no fun : no carb dieters can feel low on energy and constantly hungry ' the doctors suggested that the fact i had n't been drinking milk for over two years may have weakened my bones , ' she says			0
while low - carb diets have waned in popularity since a peak in the early 2000s , many still embark on them			0
research shows nearly 50 per cent of women sometimes feel guilty about eating carbohydrates and one in ten always does			0
such is the pressure to keep thin , many are willing to risk their health by cutting them out			0
mum - of - three @entity22 , 27 , suffered migraines and dizziness during ten months on such a diet			1
she wanted to shed weight after the birth of her second daughter @entity168			0
although she lost over three stone , she gave up when she realised it had affected her fertility			0
' the only carbs i 'd eat all day were the 50g of porridge made with water for breakfast , ' says @entity22 , who lives in @entity178 , @entity179 , with her mechanic husband @entity180 , 26			1
' after that , it would be chicken salad , protein shakes or egg whites			0
' i was losing two pounds a week : i had been 11st 3lb , too much for my 5ft 4in height			0
i loved the results , but i was crying all the time because i was so hungry - but the more i did it , the more obsessed i was about leaving carbs out of my diet			1
the headaches and exhaustion were terrible			0
i ’d feel dizzy and almost passed out several times			1
my periods stopped then became erratic			0
i put it down to the diet			2
' ' i nearly passed out			2
i felt sick and could n't function properly			0
around day three i developed a headache so bad i thought it was a migraine and my skin and scalp became dry and itchy ' @entity22 's rapid weight loss on the no - carb diet was to blame , says dr @entity101			1
' if you lose 5 - 10 per cent of your body weight very quickly - as she did - the body reacts by shutting down ovulation because it knows it wo n't be able to cope in a pregnancy			0
as soon as you start eating a well - balanced diet again , and regain weight , ovulation should begin again			1
' @entity22 adds : ' @entity180 and i both wanted another baby and had started trying six months after we 'd had @entity168 , but it just was n't happening			1
when i reintroduced carbs , we conceived @entity216 almost straight away			2
' despite having learned a hard lesson , she still sees carbohydrates as something of an enemy			0
' even now i feel a bit guilty when i overdo it on carbs , ' she says			2
@entity225 , of the @entity226 , says she often sees women in her clinical practice consumed with guilt			0
' they think they 've ruined their diet because they 've eaten a slice of bread or a potato but the reality is we need carbohydrates in our diet for energy and fibre to help our bowel function , as well as vitamin b. if you 're lacking vitamin @entity246 , found in many fortified cereals , you can develop anaemia as it helps form red blood cells			2
' cutting out one food group is a sure way to become ill. every cell needs glucose , so if you suddenly become depleted in it , you 'll begin to suffer lethargy , headaches , cramps , irritability , depression			0
problem : @entity1 developed @entity96 as a result of her diet ( posed by model ) ' you might have constipation , because of the lack of fibre			1
the bowel often does n't recover from a drastic change of diet			2
' if you continue the regime for many months , the body starts to take its energy from protein stores in the muscles			0
so your muscles - including your heart - will be wasting away			0
your skin , hair and nails will become thin , dry and flaky			0
' i do n't think you 'd survive for longer than about five years on an extremely low - carb diet			2
@entity283 32 , who runs her own jewellery business in @entity285 , says she still feels guilty when carbs pass her lips , although ditching them has played havoc with her health			1
she took up the @entity16 , or caveman , diet - based on the food supposedly eaten by @entity294 humans			1
' within three days of starting the @entity16 diet - lots of meat , no sugar , carbs , caffeine or dairy - i 'd lost half a stone but was so ill it felt like my body was in shock			1
' i nearly passed out			2
i felt sick and could n't function properly			0
around day three i developed a headache so bad i thought it was a migraine and my skin and scalp became dry and itchy			0
' i started reintroducing things like sweet potato but two weeks later noticed lumps in my armpit and was absolutely petrified it could be cancer			0
' my gp he reassured me it was n't cancer , but tiny boils , and it was down to my unbalanced diet			2
i started eating carbs again and soon the lumps had gone			2
' dr @entity101 says boils could result from an immune system weakened by rapid weight loss			0
' in those without diabetes , boils are usually associated with low immunity that promotes infection of hair follicles , ' she says , and recommends vitamin supplements to dieters			0
@entity283 says her diet is back to normal now			1
' even though the experience really scared me , i still feel guilty eating carbs			2
it 's ridiculous women are prepared to risk their health just to be slim but we 're all as bad as each other			0
