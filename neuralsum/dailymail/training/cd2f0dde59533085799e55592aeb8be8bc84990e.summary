stun guns that deliver an electric shock five times more powerful than a police @entity3 are being sold on @entity5 , a @entity6 on sunday investigation has found			1
the weapons , which are disguised as torches , paralyse victims instantly and leave them in excruciating pain			1
in some cases the stun guns have been linked to brain damage and even death			2
illegal : this stun gun , bought on @entity5 by the @entity6 , was advertised as a torch to get round the website 's safeguards for sale : the devices , disguised as torches , were available on @entity5 - which mps described as ' extremely concerning ' last night politicians accused @entity5 of fuelling an alarming new threat on @entity28 ’s streets and of ‘ sacrificing public safety in the name of recklessly making profits ’			1
the auction website claims it bans the sale of illegal weapons , but @entity6 was able to buy three illegal stun guns and two pepper sprays within minutes			1
the packages , bought for as little as £ 9 , arrived days later from @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41			1
the stun guns were advertised on the site as ‘ flashlight with electric ring flash ’ to get round @entity5 safeguards that prohibit the use of the terms ‘ stun gun ’ and ‘ @entity3 ’			1
a reporter handed the weapons to the @entity52 at the @entity54 office of @entity6			2
officers said the force ’s firearms unit , @entity58 , would launch an investigation into the @entity5 stun guns , and its 31,000 officers would be briefed about their danger			2
after this newspaper alerted @entity5 , the auction site removed the listings from its website			1
however , just hours later dozens more were back on sale			0
@entity69 mp @entity68 , a member of the @entity70 , last night called on the website to review its procedures			0
he said : ‘ it is extremely concerning that @entity5 is sacrificing public safety by not banning these illegal weapons in the name of recklessly making profits			2
danger : the @entity79 was also able to buy pepper spray from a vendor based in @entity82 ‘ they are extremely dangerous and , if they fall into the wrong hands , it will be extremely worrying			1
it ’s all very well @entity5 saying it removes the items as soon as it finds them , but it is not enough and the company should have more people trawling the site looking for weapons			1
it ’s basic common sense			0
’ according to the @entity5 listings , the stun guns are capable of discharging ten milliamps – five times the amount of controversial @entity3 used by police			2
@entity5 retailer @entity101 , 52 , sold us a stun gun online for £ 19			1
when approached by a journalist at his home in @entity107 , @entity38 , he said he had sold 150 worldwide , with at least ten of them in the @entity28			2
he said he had ‘ no idea ’ that the stun guns were illegal in @entity28			0
‘ i am just a businessman , ’ mr @entity101 said			0
‘ how should i know what the politicians do n’t like in @entity113 ? ’ the other stun guns were bought from @entity39 and @entity40 while the pepper sprays were bought from @entity5 shop @entity116 , in @entity82 , @entity41			1
possessing the weapons is a criminal offence under @entity119 of the @entity120 and anyone caught with one faces up to ten years in prison			0
firearms expert @entity123 inspected the weapons for @entity6 and said they were ‘ sinister and potentially deadly ’			0
mr @entity123 , a retired @entity52 sergeant and former tactical adviser for the @entity52 ’s firearms unit , said : ‘ the @entity5 listing says they are five times as powerful as @entity3 used by the police , but they have been bought online so could be even more dangerous			1
‘ the fact they are disguised to look like a torch is even more worrying because they could easily be hidden from police			0
‘ the pepper sprays are just as bad , and if one of them went off in a crowded tube carriage it would cause mayhem			0
’ in 2012 , an @entity145 study documented eight cases of people in the @entity41 who have died or suffered significant brain damage following a cardiac arrest linked to being shot with a taser			1
forensic physician dr @entity151 said : ‘ the problem with the sprays bought off @entity5 is that , although they say that they are pepper sprays , you have n’t got a clue what they actually contain			2
' there ’s no quality control so it could be anything and it might be toxic			0
’ in a very severe case , he added , sprays could cause pulmonary oedema – potentially fatal fluid in the lungs			0
the auction website said it removed illegal products once they were found but admitted it could not guarantee unlawful items would not slip through the net			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we are investigating the cases raised where our control systems did not prevent sale of the items to a @entity28 address			0
’ preventing banned weapons entering the @entity28 is the responsibility of the @entity182			0
a spokesman said : ‘ attempting to possess and smuggle prohibited weapons into the @entity28 is a serious offence and ignorance of the law is no excuse			0
‘ make no mistake – just because it is legal to buy or own an item in another country does not mean it is legal to bring it into the @entity28			0

weapons cause excruciating pain , paralysis , and are linked to deaths
available for as little as £ 9 from online sellers in @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity39
the devices were disguised as torches to avoid @entity5 safeguards
@entity79 reporters also found dangerous pepper spray available from the @entity41
the auction website has been accused of *endangering* people for profit
