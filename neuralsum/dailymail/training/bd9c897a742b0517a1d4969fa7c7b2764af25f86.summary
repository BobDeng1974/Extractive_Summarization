four months ago @entity0 was cutting sugar cane in rural @entity2 , waiting anxiously to discover if his life - changing move to @entity5 had fallen through			1
working on the plantation was a way to take his mind off things as visa issues looked like scuppering the dream of signing a professional rugby contract with @entity13			1
he had already resigned from his post with the @entity2 navy but , after one missed flight , the paperwork was eventually approved			1
like many of his team - mates who face @entity21 on saturday , @entity18 plies his trade overseas and sends money back to his family in @entity25			1
@entity0 of @entity2 has made his dream move to @entity5 with @entity13 ‘ working on the sugar cane plant helped me get away from the stress of the visa , ’ said the prop			1
‘ you have to cut it , pull it , load it ; it ’s a tiring job ! i had spent six years in the navy and rugby was my lucky chance			2
‘ we would spend a whole month on a ship and you would see no land , only the ocean			0
there were no rugby balls either , just the gym set up in the engine room			2
‘ one day i told my family that i was going to @entity49 and they said , “ no , do n’t go ”			0
i told them we will all die one day , but rugby gave me my ticket out			2
i have to thank the lord for giving me the opportunity			0
’ @entity0 has benefited from the improved facilities available as a professional and has now established himself in the @entity2 national team			1
saturday ’s match at the @entity60 will provide an early test ahead of the @entity62 for @entity2 , who have been drawn in the ‘ group of death ’ alongside @entity21 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
@entity0 spent six years working in the navy before he got the chance to play professional rugby @entity2 - born @entity71 , who made his @entity67 debut last saturday against @entity73 , could well be lining up against his countrymen next year			1
he is the latest star player to pledge his allegiance overseas — following in the footsteps of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 — but coach @entity80 does not bear a grudge against the @entity83 winger for his decision , highlighting the vast financial gulf that exists between @entity2 and their rivals			1
‘ by western standards , the living conditions in @entity2 are very low , ’ said @entity88			2
‘ there ’s a lot of financial hardship			0
these guys build houses and provide cars for their village and family			0
we have great rugby players but very little income , so it ’s difficult to run high - quality programmes			0
@entity2 's head coach @entity80 says he does not bear a grudge against @entity71 for picking @entity67 over the country of his birth ‘ we ’re operating on about £ 650,000 a year and that covers our coaching staff , touring and everything else			1
the players are n’t here for the money , they ’re here for the pride of playing for their country			0
they get a daily allowance of about £ 80 so when @entity67 come knocking on the door , are you going to say no and play for @entity2 for £ 80 a day ? ’ @entity21 coach @entity122 has been working heavily with gps data to compare regional rugby with the @entity125 , but @entity2 only have the resources to wire up five players to the analysis system , and just one member of staff who is qualified to analyse the results			1
it can also be difficult for @entity2 to convince big clubs to release their players to join up with the squad			2
@entity2 - born @entity71 made his debut for @entity67 against the @entity73 on saturday these are just a few of the challenges of working on a shoestring , but financial constraints are nothing new and @entity2 have learned to live with it , famously knocking @entity21 out of the 2007 @entity62			1
‘ @entity141 is in the genes for these guys , ’ said @entity88			0
‘ there ’s a history that goes back to the warrior culture 100 or more years ago			0
for them , rugby has become a natural expression of what , in the distant past , would have been two villages fighting each other			0
‘ the manliness of being a warrior in @entity2 has in some ways been replaced by rugby			1
they ’re very proud of their roots			0
‘ our pool is massively tough , we know that , but we ’re not coming to make up the numbers			0
if teams are beating each other , then the points situation can become very interesting			0
‘ the 2007 victory over @entity21 has given the fans back home some very high expectations			2
we might have to watch a few of those clips on friday evening			0
