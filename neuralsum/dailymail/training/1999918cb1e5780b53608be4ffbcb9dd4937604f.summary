by @entity0 with princess @entity2 , the princess royal and @entity4 among her clients , milliner @entity1 is no stranger to designing hats for well - bred wearers			1
but her latest venture , an unusual photo shoot to mark the start of @entity11 , sees her creations appear on well - bred models of an entirely different sort			0
strutting their stuff for the camera is a succession of equine stars , most of whom appear happy - if bemused - to find themselves swapping head collars for hats			0
dapper : lovely though this cobalt straw cap is , its equine wearer seems less than impressed looking good ! a glamorous dapple grey sports an elaborate hot pink bloom enlivened with delicate crystals highlights include a spectacular gold glittery fascinator topped with a lime bow and modelled by a handsome chestnut , and a pink silk number worn by a bored - looking dapple grey			0
so good did the equine models look in the hats , milliner @entity1 , who described the shoot as ' brilliantly bizarre ' , said the horses would be in with an excellent chance of triumphing in the style stakes come @entity42 on friday			1
' i spend my days creating weird and wonderful designs for fashion - forward ladies , but never did i think i 'd be styling my hats on models of the four - legged variety , ' she revealed			2
' it was a brilliantly bizarre day , but i think they all look fabulous and are definitely a contender for the most stylish appearance this racing season			0
' neigh ! a disgruntled looking equine model sports a floppy straw number enlivened with pheasant feathers glossy : a @entity58 pony swaps the field for the catwalk in an elaborate pink floral fascinator not too keen : this horse appears distinctly unamused with the feather and straw creation perched on his head sparkling : this glossy chestnut model looks lovely in his gold glittering fascinator topped with a lime bow the unusual photo shoot was the brainchild of local portrait company @entity74 , which set up a mobile studio at the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 , where the shoot took place			1
' i 've not photographed a horse wearing a designer hat before , ' admitted @entity84 , creative director of @entity74 , ' and it 's safe to say i probably wo n't do so again ! ' although the equine stars of the shoot probably wo n't get the chance to show off their hats at @entity11 , @entity1 's designs are likely to get an airing at the race meeting			2
last year , hats by the milliner , which can cost up to £ 400 , were spotted on scores of racegoers , and have also proved a hit with princess @entity2 who has been photographed in @entity1 on numerous occasions , including a bespoke creation worn for the @entity102 service at @entity103			1
suits you sir ! the cherry red fascinator topped with elegant black feathers looks lovely on this bay horse stylish : this horse and his elaborate straw and pheasant feather hat are set to triumph in the style stakes			0
