when he was born at 24 weeks , it was almost impossible for @entity3 's parents to imagine the tiny addition to their family would survive			1
but , despite weighing just 15ozs - less than a bag of sugar - he is now five months old and has finally been allowed to go home			1
his mother , @entity9 , has spoken about how she started suffering headaches and high blood pressure which doctors told her was pre-eclampsia			1
@entity3 has finally been allowed home five months after he was born weighing just 15ozs parents @entity9 and @entity15 were faced with the agonising option of whether to abort the pregnancy when she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia it is clear how small @entity3 was when he was born from this image taken while he was in an incubator in hospital she was given the agonising option of aborting the pregnancy because the baby could be brain - damaged			1
a scan showed that @entity3 was healthy and so she vowed to continue to carry him			1
but just a day later @entity3 's father , @entity15 , 40 , got a call from the @entity32 telling him @entity9 's condition had deteriorated and they had no choice but to deliver the baby			1
doctors said @entity3 had only a ten per cent chance of surviving the caesarean section			1
incredibly , he responded well after being rushed to a neonatal intensive care unit for treatment			2
@entity9 was also rushed to intensive care after the birth and only saw her son for the first time four days later			2
@entity9 fell ill during the 23rd week of pregnancy and delivered @entity3 a day after being admitted to hospital but on the same day mother and baby met for the first time @entity3 started bleeding on the lungs and was given just 24 hours to live			1
@entity9 said : ' i ca n't remember much of that first week			0
i just wanted to know he was okay and the nurses were great at giving me updates , but i do n't think we really understood how poorly he was			0
' they took us into a room and said he 's got this big bleed on his lungs and he was very poorly			0
' we said as long as he wants to fight we want to fight with him , so they gave him an aggressive form of ventilation and we just had to wait and see			0
' my philosophy from day one was " whatever happens , happens " and that got me through			2
' @entity3 responded to the ventilation and surprised medics by beating the bleed on his lungs			1
after 16 days he was transferred to the @entity74 , @entity75 , where he was fitted with a @entity77 line to supply nutrients			0
it was a further 17 weeks before @entity3 - now five months - was finally allowed to go home with his parents on august 14			1
@entity9 said : ' it was the one question i never asked			0
we only found out a week before he came home that we could take him			2
' it 's the best feeling ever			0
from day one he had this amazing fighting spirit and i think he even amazed the doctors sometimes			2
' i ca n't even put in to words what he 's been through			0
there 's a lot of adults that would n't be able to go through it			0
' @entity9 can barely remember the first week of @entity3 's life and she did not get to see her son until he was four days old this picture shows just how small @entity3 's feet are - barely twice the size of a Â£ 1 coin @entity15 and @entity9 , from @entity101 , @entity102 , were told last year they could have children again following @entity9 's major transplant surgery			1
@entity15 urged other families with premature babies not to give up hope			0
he said : ' we did n't dare allow ourselves to think past the next hour and just took everything day by day , even hour by hour to begin with			2
' ' what he was going through , the treatments , he was being given the highest intensive care they could give , so he was very sick and we just had to hope			0
' it 's always at the back of your mind that something would happen but you just have to keep going			0
' for any other family going through this - do n't give up			0
we did n't and if @entity3 can get through it , there 's always hope			1
' the couple were told @entity3 will probably suffer from sight problems in the long - term but it is too early to say if there will be any other health complications			1
doctors yesterday hailed @entity3 as a miracle and said he had defied the odds to make it			1
consultant , @entity134 , said : ' he 's one of the smallest babies we 've looked after			0
' the fact his mother was so unwell , how early he was born - he really is a little miracle for us			2

@entity142 faced with aborting @entity3 after suffering pre-eclampsia
tests showed that he was fit and healthy , the next day he was born
now five months old , he has returned home for the first time
