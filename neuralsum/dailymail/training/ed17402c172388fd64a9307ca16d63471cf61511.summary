by @entity0 published : 13:42 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 05:28 est , 22 march 2012 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 shook central southern @entity3 on tuesday , sending terrified workers and residents running into the streets and damaging an estimated 800 homes			1
the worst hit area was the town of @entity10 , which was close to the epicenter of the quake			2
remarkably , there were no reported fatalities and only 9 serious injuries in spite of the fact that the country was rocked by 18 aftershocks in the hours following the massive earthquake			2
the southern border city of @entity22 was significantly closer to the epicenter of the earthquake , and @entity25 was staying in the town with a dozen other @entity28 students on a school trip			1
@entity62 , along with a number of publications , was aware of @entity25 's trip to @entity3 before the earthquake hit , but chose not to publicize it at the request of the @entity61			1
following tuesday 's earthquake , the @entity61 released a statement saying that she ' is safe and was never in danger			2
' though they typically request that the privacy of the teenage girl is protected when she is not with her parents or there is no inherent news interest , they decided to break their privacy streak to reassure that the first daughter is fine after the earthquake			1
disaster zone : debris is seen inside a home after a wall collapsed during an earthquake in @entity87 on tuesday what remains : a man chips away at the remnants of a wall at his house that was damaged by an earthquake on tuesday in @entity34 in the @entity3 state of @entity95 on tuesday @entity96 left : a home was turned to rubble in @entity34 in the @entity3 state of @entity95 the brave : workers put out a fire after evacuating buildings coping : patients evacuated from a damaged hospital wait for care in a makeshift er medical emergency : patients evacuated from the hospital lie in beds for rows as nurses attend to them in the outdoors in more populated areas , like nearby @entity22 and @entity87 which is further away , terrified workers fled the swaying buildings as plaster crashed to the pavement and windows broke			1
the @entity120 said the ' strong , long ' tremors reached 7.4 on the @entity122			0
the epicenter of the quake was 15 miles ( 25km ) east of @entity34 in @entity95 state , near the @entity127 resort of @entity128			2
earthquakes happen frequently in @entity3 , and the country has registered 15 above a 7 - magnitude since 1973			0
help : paramedics tend to a woman who sustained some kind of injury from the noon 7.4 - magnitude earthquake helpless : workers and residents gather at the @entity139 square after evacuating buildings during the earthquake panicked : a terrified woman falls to her knees as office workers run into the streets part of the reason why tuesday 's earthquake did not prove more disasterous is because each of the weak buildings that collapsed in the prior 15 earthquakes were rebuilt stronger			1
panicked residents screamed in fear as they were evacuated from buildings across the city just after midday			2
damage : the quake caused a portion of a bridge to collapse on top of this bus but no word yet if there were any injuries lucky : miraculously , the passengers and driver of the bus that was damaged by the bridge escaped alive responding to the scene : firefighters worked to move the bridge debris one @entity87 resident , @entity172 , told @entity62 : ‘ it was very scary , i was in my apartment and i did n’t know if it was best to try and run down the stairs to get outside or hide under the table			1
‘ in the end i hid under the table but it was probably not the smartest thing to do as it seems all the offices around here were evacuated to outside , there are still a lot of people outside now , ' the 30 - year - old said			2
‘ my apartment building in @entity187 was shaking and swaying for about five minutes and kept moving even after the earthquake had stopped			1
' location : the 7.4 - magnitude earthquake struck @entity34 at 12.02pm local time injuries : this woman was being treated by @entity195 representatives following the repercussions felt in @entity87 aghast : shocked city dwellers stared in horror in the roads and traffic ground to a halt in the capital telephone lines went down and traffic ground to halt in the capital just moments after the quake , but there is still mass confusion throughout the city			1
though the magnitude of the earthquake - 7.4 according to the @entity120 - was extremely high , there was relatively little severe damage and no known fatalities			0
one of the main reasons why is that the earthquake struck very deep into the ground			0
it hit 12.4 miles ( 20 km ) below the surface , which helped to mute the tremor before it got to ground and reverberated among buildings			2
it also helped that the epicenter was far enough away from major cities			2
because it was closest to @entity22 ( the country 's 10th biggest state by population ) the damage was lessened due to a lack of closely - knit buildings			1
by comparison , the deadly earthquake that hit @entity235 in 2010 was registered as 7.0 on the @entity122 , but was much nearer the capital city and only 8.1 miles ( 13 km ) below ground			0
‘ the phone lines are now down but the internet seems to still be working , ’ ms @entity172 told @entity62			0
the @entity242 warned of the possibility of some local tsunami effects , although it said the inland earthquake would not generate a destructive widespread tsunami			0

' children stood terrified as the earthquake hit right near lunchtime , at 12.02 pm local time superficial : in spite of the strength of the quake , most of the damage appears to be relatively insignificant transport chaos : a driver stands by his car looking up at battered buildings and trying to use his mobile phone network ' it was very strong , but we did n't see anything fall , ' said @entity292 , who runs a guesthouse in @entity22 , near @entity95			1
she said their telephones were down and that the quake had shaken the hotel from side to side			0
the earthquake began six miles ( 10km ) underground , and was followed by a 4.8 - magnitude aftershock , according to @entity3 's national seismological agency			0
