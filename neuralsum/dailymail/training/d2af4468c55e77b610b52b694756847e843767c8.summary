by @entity0 last updated at 2:44 am on 14th january 2012 an it worker who feared he might never have children after being paralysed from the waist down in a rugby accident is celebrating the birth of his daughter			1
@entity7 , 34 , was just 18 - years - old when he broke his neck during a heavy tackle whilst playing his first professional rugby match			1
the 6 ’ 3 ” sportsman , who was paralysed from the neck down , was warned he would never walk again after suffering severe damage to his spinal cord			1
dream come true : @entity7 with his wife @entity16 and baby @entity17			1
he said he never thought he would have a family after he was paralysed at 18 he spent eight months in hospital undergoing intensive physiotherapy in rehab before slowly regaining the use of his arms and body , although the prospect of ever getting married and having a family still seemed remote to him			2
but after meeting girlfriend @entity16 , 30 , @entity7 was inspired to get to his feet for the first time in 15 years on their wedding day , with the aid of callipers			1
now almost a year later , the delighted couple are celebrating the birth of their first child , @entity35			1
@entity7 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ' when i first had the accident i just wanted to get better			1
i knew that i would change my life and i would have to look to the future			1
' i did n’t see myself getting married and having kids at that point , it was the last thing that was going to happen to me			0
but now i have ticked all the boxes and it seems like a long way away since that time			0
' it was surreal watching @entity35 being born			0
i ca n’t describe it			0
to watch her being born and then put into @entity16 ’s arms was the best thing in the world			1
then the midwife handed her to me			0
i stared into her eyes and stuck my tongue out at her and she did the same to me ! ' i ’m living the life i never thought that i would			2
it ’s all fallen into place in the last 12 months			2
it ’s been the best year of my life			1
' @entity7 had played as a fullback and centre from the age of 10 and after being signed up by professional club @entity67 at the age of 18 he had hoped to form a career as a top rugby player			1
@entity7 ( pictured holding his school trophy in the front row ) had dreams of becoming a professional rugby player but he was injured during his very first senior game for the new club in 1995 when a two - man tackle from behind knocked him to the ground			1
for two months he was unable to move any part of his body and dropped from 15st to just over 7st , relying on his family to help him eat , wash and dress			0
after eight months in hospital he regained control of his arms and upper body , but remained paralysed from the waist down			0
determined not to give up , he spent several years focusing on intensive physiotherapy training before embarking on a @entity89			0
he was convinced that his wheelchair would make establishing relationships with women impossible , but he met @entity16 eleven years ago and they married last october			0
@entity16 became pregnant not long after and baby @entity35 was born at 4.13am on october 1 , just two days before the couple ’s first wedding anniversary , which was the date she had originally been due			2
now @entity7 , who has recently set a world record after completing a charity indoor rowing marathon using only his arms , says that his life is complete and his next challenge is to be able to walk his daughter up the aisle in the future			1
@entity7 managed to stand on his wedding day last year to @entity16 @entity7 said : ' @entity16 ’s mum is called @entity106 and it ’s been handed down the family , so we thought @entity35 would be a modern twist			1
she ’s really playful and she ’s already starting to develop a personality			2
' i think she will probably grow up to be a gymnast or a dancer like her mum			0
she ’s really long so she has the right build ! ' she started smiling for the first time last week			2
seeing that makes it all worth - while after coming home from work			0
picking her up and cuddling her is great because she now knows who her mum and dad are			0
first thing in the morning when i look into the cot i can see her smiling up at me , it takes your heart away			0
' i ’ve got everything i could possibly ask for			0
there ’s nothing more that we need , apart from a couple more kids in the future			2
' when i first had the accident there was no chance i ever thought i would be in this position with a family and a baby			0
i thought that no one would see past the wheelchair , if i knew then what i know now i would n’t have been so afraid of it			0
' the proud father , who has recently started working for an @entity151 company , has not given up his dream of walking one day and since his accident he has followed a strict daily physio programme to strengthen the muscles in his legs			0
@entity7 said : ' i am still doing my physio each day and walk using my parallel bars and callipers			1
' since standing up at our wedding i have done that more and i walk using my parallel bars			2
' i ’m determined to get walking even more for @entity35			0
now i have a daughter i would love to be able to walk her down the aisle in the future			1
' new mother @entity16 , a @entity166 teacher , said : ' having @entity35 really makes us feel complete			0
she ’s a really happy and content baby			2
' @entity7 ’s always been very determined and i ’m really proud of him			1
his positivity has always attracted me to him and now he ’s now working towards walking unaided			1
' since we first met his determination has already allowed him to break a world record and stand up at our wedding			0
now , he ’s working towards walking down the aisle when she ’s older			1

' it ’s been the best year of my life '
