by @entity0 calling for change : dr @entity2 of the @entity3 said making good choices later in life was ' critical ' the middle - aged are to be warned by @entity6 not to share a bottle of wine a night because they think they have ‘ earned a rest ’			1
guidelines from the health watchdog @entity12 tells doctors to urge patients in their 50s and 60s to take more exercise , lose weight and cut back on alcohol to prevent dementia and other illnesses			1
importantly , gps will be told to inform patients that even sticking within the government ’s safe alcohol guidelines of two units a day for women and three for men raises the risk of future illness			2
a typical bottle of wine contains ten units of alcohol			1
the guidelines also state there is ‘ no safe level of alcohol consumption ’			2
there is growing evidence that many illnesses such as dementia , heart disease , certain cancers and diabetes are strongly linked to lifestyles			1
only yesterday research published by @entity47 found that a third of all @entity50 ’s cases could be linked to behaviours such as lack of exercise , obesity and smoking			2
@entity12 warns middle - aged adults have far worse lifestyles than older or younger generations and tend to drink heavily , be overweight and have raised cholesterol and blood pressure			1
in guidelines issued yesterday , it tells @entity6 to urge patients to change their behaviours during routine appointments or the three - yearly @entity67 health check - ups , offered to all those aged 40 to 74			1
specifically , patients will be encouraged to cut back on alcohol as much as possible over concerns that it is the ‘ norm ’ in middle age to drink daily at home			1
they will also be urged to ask patients about their sleeping patterns over concerns not getting enough increases the risk of dementia , heart disease and diabetes			1
patients will also be told to take up gardening , walking , cycling or even a new sport particularly if retirement means they have more time on their hands			0
but the guidelines add that patients should not assume middle - age is a time for ‘ slowing down ’ and assuming they have ‘ earned a rest ’			1
sharing a bottle of wine after work simply because it felt like it has been earned could put you at risk of disease later in life professor @entity101 , director of @entity12 ’s @entity102 , said : ‘ the good news is we are living longer , but these extra years are not always spent in good health			1
ill health and dependency are not inevitable consequences of old age			0
‘ the risk of developing dementia , disability and frailty can be reduced			0
everyone now understands that smoking , drinking too much alcohol , being inactive or overweight can seriously damage your health , but what many do n’t realise is these factors also increase the likelihood of them developing dementia			2
‘ obviously the earlier in life that healthy changes are made the better , but it ’s never too late to start			0
’ the guidelines highlight figures showing women aged 65 to 74 and men aged 55 to 64 are the unhealthiest of all groups			0
nearly one in six women aged 65 to 74 have four or more bad habits that put them at risk of poor future health including smoking , obesity , not exercising and having a poor diet			2
and one in five men aged 55 to 64 have four or more			0
dr @entity2 , of the @entity3 , said : making good choices later in life is critical			0
’ the @entity67 is denying surgery to patients who are n’t deemed to be suffering enough pain , according to a report			0
nearly three - quarters of gp - led local health authorities – known as @entity150 – enforce ‘ arbitrary rules ’ to determine which patients can undergo treatments such as hip replacements and hernia repair			2
a number refuse to take out children ’s tonsils unless parents can prove they are frequently off sick from school or that the pain is affecting their learning			0
the report , by the @entity162 , shows many of the groups , which were set up last year , are ignoring @entity67 guidelines and imposing their own ‘ unethical ’ restrictions			0
last night @entity167 , president of the @entity162 , added : ‘ this report seems to show local commissioners are imposing arbitrary rules governing access to some routine surgery			0
