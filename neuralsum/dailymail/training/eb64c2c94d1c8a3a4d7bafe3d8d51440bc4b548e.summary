@entity9 could be heard howling in the background of a harrowing phone call made by her husband @entity12 which was played to an inquest			2
@entity3 nurse @entity16 , who took the call , asked him a series of computer - prompted questions then told him : ‘ i appreciate she is in pain but she does n’t need an ambulance			1
’ even when mrs given herself begged the nurse for help mrs @entity29 refused to send an ambulance but told her to take painkillers and wait for her gp			1
mrs given , 58 , died minutes before the doctor arrived after suffering a massive heart attack due to a blockage in an artery			1
yesterday , after a coroner ruled human error amounting to neglect played a part in her death , mr given said his ‘ caring ’ wife – a former hospital sister – had been dedicated to the @entity3 for 22 years , but was failed by it when she needed it most			1
he believes she would be alive today if an ambulance had been sent			2
‘ she was effectively begging for her life , crying on the telephone because she was in so much pain , but still they refused to send an ambulance , ’ he said			1
‘ my wife was fit and healthy until that day , but now she is just another statistic			2
i ’ve had no apology , nobody in the @entity59 seems to care			0
‘ @entity9 ’s death has been devastating			0
we had plans to enjoy our retirement and grow old together , but now that ’s all gone			0
my wife was a caring person			0
' she was always the first person to help if someone was in trouble or ill. she would do anything for anyone			0
a post mortem examination revealed that @entity9 given was suffering from severe heart disease ' she devoted most of her working life to the @entity3 and they failed her terribly in her hour of need			1
the @entity3 today is a shambles			1
’ the inquest heard that mrs given fell ill in the morning of july 16 last year at the couple ’s home in @entity78 , near @entity79 , north @entity80			2
the former nurse , who had to retire because of arthritis but had no previous history of heart problems , was vomiting and complaining of agonising pains in her abdomen and lower back			1
when she was no better by the afternoon mr given , 66 , a retired publican , telephoned the couple ’s gp surgery for advice			0
grieving : @entity93 , left , is to sue the @entity95 ambulance service over the death of his wife @entity9 , right the receptionist told him that dr @entity101 would call at their home later that day , but advised him to dial 999 if mrs given needed urgent help			1
bosses of a @entity32 out - of - hours service which fiddled its figures hundreds of times handed themselves huge bonuses , it has emerged			1
@entity111 , chief executive of @entity112 which is responsible for out - of - hours gp services in @entity114 , was awarded the performance - related sum of £ 812,250 on top of his £ 700,000 annual salary			1
a report by @entity120 today reveals that last year the firm fiddled its figures on 252 separate occasions to cover up poor care			0
this data included the number of patients who were able to see a doctor as well as how long they were made to wait			0
the @entity130 report reveals that the figures were made to look so good that another unnamed manager at @entity112 was handed a bonus for his performance			0
it also accuses managers at @entity112 of trying to root out whistleblowers who had raised concerns about poor care			0
at around 3pm mr given dialled 999 , but when he asked for an ambulance his call was triaged and put through to mrs @entity29 at the @entity3 call centre in @entity143 for assessment			1

after asking the couple , who had been together for more than 30 years , a series of computerised questions mrs @entity29 decided against sending an ambulance			1
when questioned by coroner @entity152 , mrs @entity29 admitted it was ultimately the computer and not the nurse who decided whether an ambulance should be dispatched			1
however , she said that , on occasion , she had not agreed with the computer ’s findings			0
asked whether she had felt any ‘ gut instinct ’ that an ambulance should have been called , mrs @entity29 , who resigned soon after the tragedy , replied : ‘ yes			1
’ @entity163 , a manager with @entity3 , said not enough questions had been asked of mrs given about the length of time she had been in pain and exactly where the pain was			1
asked by the coroner whether nurses could deviate from the computer programme , mrs @entity163 replied : ‘ the system is to support their clinical knowledge			0
’ the inquest at @entity179 town hall on tuesday was also told that the call centre was noisy at times which could stop nurses hearing responses clearly			0
mrs given died of severe atheroma – a blockage most commonly caused by cholesterol deposits or swelling of the arteries – and left ventricular failure			1
happier times : mr and mrs given are pictured on their wedding day in 1998 recording a verdict of death from natural causes , mr @entity152 said human error , which amounted to neglect , had played a part in mrs given ’s death			0
he added that he would be recommending the ambulance trust examine the working environment at the call centre to improve soundproofing			2
mrs given worked as a sister at the now closed @entity3 hospital for the mentally ill in @entity210 for 22 years before retiring in 1993			2
mr given said : ‘ dr @entity101 told the hearing it ’s likely my wife would be here today if they had sent an ambulance			2
' she could have had an injection to remove the blockage if she had been seen sooner , but the two - hour delay proved fatal			2
’ however , the coroner said he doubted whether paramedics would have carried or been able to administer such an injection			0
