and surprisingly what are commonly known as effective practises , are actually misconceptions and have no hard evidence to back them up			2
' the most amazing things are so common place , ' @entity12 manager @entity37 told @entity40			2

well sorry to all those people who went out and bought an expensive mattress to ease their aching backs , but it 's most likely not helping			0

number three myth : ' you should wear a neck brace if you have a whiplash neck injury ' number four myth : ' ultrasound enhances recovery after ankle sprains ' ' there 's a lot of myths that just seem common sense and are common for people , because it 's usually something to do with your everyday life			1
' ' when people get used to it , they relate to it and with myths it 's hard to change what happens in practice , ' said ms @entity37			1
number three is ' you should wear a neck brace if you have a whiplash neck injury '			1
just like @entity156 model @entity155 who was recently seen wearing a neck brace after a car accident she had in @entity159 , people often believe this is the way to heal their body quicker , but in fact that 's not the case			1
@entity165 says for those who suffer spinal fractures at accidents , it is completely necessary , but if there is no fracture and just whiplash , research has found that wearing a brace is detrimental			2
' the best treatments are to stay active and use graded activity , to increase the amount of activity			0
' wearing a collar contradicts that			0
' @entity37 from @entity181 ( physiotherapy evidence database ) says research suggests wearing a neck brace after a whiplash injury can actually be detrimental to your health four and five are based on the use of gadgets that people have to pay for , which can sometimes be expensive			1
ultrasound for the recovery of ankle sprains and an incentive spirometer - a device which patients use to help them take deep breaths to prevent complications during upper abdominal surgery or cardiac surgery - are two unnecessary treatments which can cost a considerable amount			0
' research shows an incentive spirometer does n't change complication rates , and it happens in hospitals across @entity156 everyday			0
' ms @entity37 says most of these findings will be interesting to @entity156 and some will debate what have been labelled myths			2
' i suppose the best way to debate this is to look at the research - it rigorously removes personal opinion based on hard numbers , research done well			0
' ' we really value the physiotherapist database , it provides high level evidence to support these claims and having treatment guided by research is a great way to make decision about health care			1
