it 's @entity1 season on the sub-continent and the world 's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the @entity7 , cricket 's most exciting and richest domestic tournament			1
eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round @entity14 in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament 's eighth edition , with the final taking place at @entity20 in @entity21 on may 24			1
can @entity22 retain their title ? will @entity24 lead the @entity25 to their first title ? can @entity28 's @entity27 win their third crown ? and who are the players to watch out for ? @entity31 tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 @entity7 as @entity14 prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow			1
@entity28 , pictured in the 2011 @entity36 , is looking to guide @entity27 to a third title @entity27 the bright yellow jerseys of the @entity27 are one of the iconic sights of the @entity7			1
led by the superstar @entity42 duo of @entity28 and @entity44 , @entity45 are the most successful team in @entity7 history			1
as well as their back - to - back victories in 2010 and 2011 , @entity27 have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four			0
in international players @entity28 , @entity44 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , the @entity27 have probably the best pool of @entity42 talent in the tournament , which is key given that seven of the starting @entity59 have to be domestic players			2
the foreign talent is also strong , though , and includes @entity63 captain @entity62 , @entity65 @entity64 and @entity42 all - rounder @entity66			0
one to watch : there are so many			0
@entity28 needs no introduction , @entity44 is the top scorer in @entity7 history , but @entity69 is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment			1
he hit the first ever @entity7 century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant @entity76 campaign			1
@entity62 's aggressive brand of cricket led @entity63 to the @entity76 final £ 1,740,000 - @entity81 's salary , the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by @entity83 in the auction			1
3325 - runs @entity44 has scored , the most in tournament history			2
2008 - year the @entity7 was first played			1
119 - wickets taken by @entity86 , the most in the history of the tournament			2
60 - matches in the 2015 tournament			1
46 - days the tournament lasts , beginning on april 8 and ending on may 24			1
12 - venues to be used in 2015			2
8 - teams in 2015 edition of the @entity7			1
3 - @entity95 players in the tournament - @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
@entity83 the side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final			1
the @entity83 have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year			2
they are led by @entity65 @entity108 and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , although @entity118 all - rounder @entity117 is a handy player as well			0
@entity76 outcasts @entity81 , @entity120 and @entity121 , all of whom featured in @entity14 's successful 2011 team , will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning			0
one to watch : in 22 - year - old @entity129 , @entity128 have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world			2
@entity132 has already scored six one - day international tons but his highest score in the @entity76 was an unbeaten 78			0
@entity135 winner @entity81 will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year 's @entity14 team @entity59 after years of just making up the numbers , the @entity59 lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round - robin stage before losing in the final			1
@entity145 's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong @entity147 contingent , and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			2
but the @entity59 also have @entity65 powerhouse @entity155 in their ranks along with @entity118 @entity158			0
their @entity42 talent is n't the strongest in the tournament but @entity162 and @entity163 have both performed on the big stage for their country , and 21 - year - old @entity166 is one of the best young talents in @entity14			1
one to watch : the destructive @entity168			0
one banner in the stands in @entity171 last year read ' @entity172 - the @entity173 '			0
it was @entity151 's power - hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the @entity76 just how dangerous he can be			0
@entity151 was one of the top run - scorers in the @entity7 last year and almost guided the @entity59 to the title @entity21 knight riders the reigning champions @entity22 have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third @entity7 title in four years			1
@entity187 's international career may have stalled , but he is still one of the most talented @entity42 batsmen out there			0
along with @entity187 , @entity189 was also part of @entity14 's @entity135 winning team while @entity192 was the leading run - scorer last year with 660			0
in terms of overseas talent , @entity21 boast @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity201 all - rounder @entity200 and @entity203 @entity202			2
one to watch : it 's rare for @entity14 to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace , but they have one in @entity207			0
@entity21 will be looking for @entity208 to combine with @entity116 and @entity195 as part of a fearsome bowling attack			2
@entity195 , pictured in action for the @entity22 in the @entity212 @entity214 indians the team that once featured the great @entity216 finally won the @entity7 in 2013 , and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year			1
in @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 , @entity214 have a strong core of @entity42 talent , but it is their overseas game - winners that makes them dangerous			0
@entity118 fast bowler @entity86 is the highest wicket - taker in tournament history with 119 , and he is joined by @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232			0
after losing in the eliminator against @entity45 last year , the @entity233 will once again expect to reach the play - offs and mount a serious challenge for the title			2
one to watch : the demon bowler that is @entity240 has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the @entity7 and was key in their success in 2013			2
he will once again lead this bowling attack			0
@entity233 batsman @entity219 pictured in action for @entity14 against @entity247 at the @entity76 2008 : @entity248 2009 : @entity249 ( defunct ) 2010 : @entity27 2011 : @entity27 2012 : @entity22 2013 : @entity233 2014 : @entity22 @entity252 royals since @entity254 's side won the inaugural @entity7 in 2008 , the @entity248 have only made the play - offs on one occasion since			1
@entity252 's short history has been eventful to say the lease			0
they were expelled by the @entity259 and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot - fixing scandal that saw former test match bowler @entity261 banned for life			0
this year 's @entity248 team features a strong @entity147 presence in captain @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 as well as @entity63 seamer @entity268			2
their @entity42 talent lacks star quality , though , with @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 the only men who have forced their way into the national side			0
one to watch : @entity277 has enjoyed a summer of dominating @entity14 and was instrumental in his country winning the @entity76			0
@entity266 is a dangerous player with the bat , can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament			0
@entity266 will look to continue his excellent form into the @entity7 with @entity252 bollywood actress @entity287 , pictured in 2009 , is a part owner of the @entity248 @entity25 any batting order that contains @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity24 has half a chance , but it has been @entity292 's bowling that has held them back in recent years			2
@entity292 have never won the @entity7 and have missed out on the play - offs altogether in the last three years			1
the @entity25 paid big money in the auction to pick up @entity297 ( £ 1.17million ) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag			0
but news that @entity76 player of the tournament @entity303 will miss the start of the @entity7 will hurt their bowling attack			1
one to watch : any of their big three batsmen really , but @entity307 is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots			0
@entity24 and @entity289 pictured playing for @entity25 in the 2012 tournament @entity65 @entity313 is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket @entity316 the newest team in the @entity7 , the @entity316 are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the @entity249			1
the @entity316 will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of @entity321 and @entity322 and their middle order will feature @entity324 and @entity95 duo @entity98 and @entity97			1
@entity325 also landed @entity99 in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £ 205,000 after he was released by the @entity83 , but the 34 - year - old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play - offs			1
@entity99 reached the agreement with the @entity316 in order to return to @entity334 in an attempt to resurrect his @entity337 career , but the play - offs take place during the same week as @entity337 's first test against @entity63 at @entity342			1
the @entity316 also boast a a strong bowling line - up with foreign stars @entity344 and @entity346 supported by @entity42 internationals @entity348 and @entity349			0
one to watch : @entity325 's strength is up top with captain @entity321 and @entity352			0
the @entity42 batsman scored two centuries at the recent @entity76 and , like @entity321 , has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he 's there for a while			0
@entity97 will look to move on quickly from @entity337 's miserable @entity76 when he plays in the @entity7 @entity99 , here playing for @entity128 in 2012 , will join @entity325 if they make the play - offs			1

@entity7 2015 to begin in @entity21 on *wednesday* , april 8
