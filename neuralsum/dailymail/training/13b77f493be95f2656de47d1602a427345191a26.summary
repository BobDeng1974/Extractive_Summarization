by @entity0 astronomers have found a bizarre rapidly spinning star that appears to ‘ vanish ’ and transform every so often			2
known as a pulsar , it is part of a binary system with another star one fifth the mass of the sun , and occasionally its radio beacon vanishes while the system brightens considerably			2
scientists had been baffled by the odd behaviour , but now they think it might be caused by the pulsar sucking in material from its companion star and spitting it out again			1
in this artist 's concept one model of pulsar @entity23 is shown before ( top ) and after ( bottom ) its radio beacon ( green ) vanished			1
when the stream surges from its partner , an accretion disk forms and gamma - ray particle jets ( magenta ) obscure the beam when a massive star collapses and explodes as a supernova , its crushed core may survive as a compact remnant called a neutron star or pulsar			1
this is an object squeezing more mass than the sun 's into a sphere no larger than @entity46 young isolated neutron stars rotate tens of times each second and generate beams of radio , visible light , x-rays and gamma rays that astronomers observe as pulses whenever the beams sweep past @entity57			1
pulsars also generate powerful outflows , or ' winds , ' of high - energy particles moving near the speed of light			0
the power for all this comes from the pulsar 's rapidly spinning magnetic field and over time , as the pulsars wind down , these emissions fade			2
more than 30 years ago , astronomers discovered another type of pulsar revolving in 10 milliseconds or less , reaching incredible rotational speeds up to 43,000 revolutions per minute , which became known as millisecond pulsars			2
while young pulsars usually appear in isolation , more than half of millisecond pulsars occur in binary systems , which suggests an explanation for their rapid spin			0
the two - star system , known as @entity83 , is located about 4,400 light - years away in the constellation @entity84			0
measurements were made by @entity88 ’s @entity57 - orbiting @entity87 , which is used to observe emissions of gamma rays , the most powerful form of light			1
this particular observation was made more than a year ago in june 2013 , but only now do astronomers think they have an explanation for what ’s going on			0
known as @entity97 , the rapidly spinning neutron star is referred to as a 1.7 - millisecond pulsar , denoting the time it takes to rotate at an incredible 43,000 revolutions per minute			1
the other star - which is a more regular sun - like star by comparison - completes an orbit of the pulsar in just 4.8 hours , which places them so close together that the pulsar will gradually evaporate its companion			1
what is happening is that the pulsar is changing from a low - mass x-ray binary ( @entity115 ) to a radio pulsar periodically as it does so			2
an @entity115 is a binary star that is luminious in @entity118 , while a radio pulsar is one that emits a radio beam			2
for some reason the pulsar seems to be switching between the two states			0
astronomers now think that it is because the pulsar is sucking material from its companion star			1
as the companion star orbits it is continuously losing gas to the pulsar			1
however it seems to occasionally undergo surges , for reasons unknown , when it loses more material than normal to the pulsar			2
this forms a disk of material around the pulsar , which slowly falls closer to the pulsar up to an altitude of just 50 miles ( 80 kilometres ) above it , where it becomes superheated			2
when this happens it obscures the emission of radio waves from the pulsar 's poles			1
but the disk itself emits x-rays , so the pulsar switches from emitting beams of gamma and radio waves to beams of x-rays			1
the pulsar can be obscured for years while the transformation takes place , until it becomes an @entity115 - like object and begins emitting x-rays			1
eventually the disk dissipates and the pulsar goes back to just emitting noticeable radio waves			0
when a massive star collapses and explodes as a supernova , its crushed core may survive as a compact remnant called a neutron star or pulsar			0
this is an object squeezing more mass than the sun 's into a sphere no larger than @entity182 rotate tens of times each second and generate beams dr @entity185 , an astrophysicist at the @entity186 , who led the international effort to understand this striking transformation , explains to @entity189 that the pulsar changed from being like an @entity115 just over a decade ago			1
it then became a radio pulsar for about six to seven years before last year , when it changed back into an @entity115 - like object			0
‘ what we do n't know is how long it will be in this phase for because we have n't seen a complete cycle , ’ he explains			0
‘ we do n't know when it will happen again nor whether it is periodic or even episodic			0
‘ so we are continuing to monitor the source at radio , optical , x-ray and gamma - ray wavelengths to try and catch the exact moment it changes again			0
’ in a press release dr @entity185 added : ‘ it 's almost as if someone flipped a switch , morphing the system from a lower - energy state to a higher - energy one			0
‘ the change appears to reflect an erratic interaction between the pulsar and its companion , one that allows us an opportunity to explore a rare transitional phase in the life of this binary			0
’ @entity224 , a postdoctoral researcher at the @entity225 ( @entity226 ) in @entity227 who discovered @entity23 in 2007 , added : ' astronomers have long suspected millisecond pulsars were spun up through the transfer and accumulation of matter from their companion stars , so we often refer to them as recycled pulsars			1
' the findings were published in the @entity237			0
the team reports that @entity239 is the first example of a transient , compact , low - mass gamma - ray binary ever seen			0
the researchers anticipate that the system will serve as a unique laboratory for understanding how millisecond pulsars form and for studying the details of how accretion takes place on neutron stars			0
@entity88 's @entity87 was launched on 11 june 2008			1
it is situated in low @entity57 orbit and is used to perform gamma - ray astronomy observations with its main instrument , the @entity87 , which can perform an all - sky surveys and is used to study pulsars like @entity23			1

astronomers led from @entity186 studied a *distant* pulsar
called @entity23 it seems to be sucking gas from a companion and vanishing
they studied the star using @entity88 's @entity87
on occasion its companion star experiences surges in its loss of gas
the reason for this is unknown , but it creates a disk around the pulsar
this becomes superheated and obscures the pulsar from view
it also changes the type of emissions from the pulsar - from radio to x-rays
the whole process seems to takes about a decade but might not be regular
