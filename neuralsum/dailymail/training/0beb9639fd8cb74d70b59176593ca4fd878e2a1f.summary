there was a time when the @entity3 class system was quite simple			1
often the subject of satire – most notably in the @entity6 sketch of the 1960s – it basically came down to @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
half a century on , however , the @entity13 and academics claim that is outdated and we now fall into seven social groups			1
on the other hand , if your income is over £ 89,000 a year , you have a comfortable private pension , and you go to dinner parties with lawyers and dentists , you belong to the @entity54			0
the new social scale , backed by the @entity13 and called the @entity56 , tries to take into account the music we listen to , the people we mix with , and the likelihood that we use social networks , to determine where we stand			1
more than 160,000 people took part in the poll via the @entity13 website			1
new class : only six per cent of people are classed as @entity70			1
people in this group tend to mix with people similar to themselves and enjoy highbrow culture and tend to live in the suburbs bang in the middle : the new affluent workers are youthful and are sit in the middle in terms of wealth			2
many of the group tend to live in former manufacturing areas in the @entity84 and @entity85 on the decline : a much smaller percentage than may have been expected are in the @entity89 group , which has the oldest average age at 66 financially insecure : the 19 per cent of @entity3 that are classed as an @entity92 tend to be young and have low scores for saving and house value but spend time enjoying emerging culture and socialising freshly - identified classes include a @entity70 , which contains aircraft pilots , radiographers and social researchers , and @entity101 , children of the old working class who went to new universities , many of them people working in sales			1
call centre workers and chefs fall into an ‘ @entity110 ’ of educated young people in insecure jobs who are well versed in popular music , sport and social networks			0
the @entity47 – a word coined from precarious and the @entity118 jargon proletariat – make up nearly one in six of the population			1
the survey said they have tiny incomes , no savings , rent their homes , have the least cultural interests of any social class , and are ‘ the most deprived ’			0
a high concentration of the @entity47 , the survey claims , can be found in @entity130			2
one of the academics who drew up the new scale , @entity135 sociology professor @entity134 , said it presented a ‘ more sophisticated , nuanced picture of what class is like now ’			0
she added : ‘ it is what is in the middle which is really interesting and exciting , there is a much more fuzzy area between the traditional working class and traditional middle class			0
’ but author and social commentator @entity147 said : ‘ this survey has kept sociologists busy , but it is a doubtful use of @entity13 resources			2
it does show how difficult it is to categorise people			0
' but it also shows there is plenty of social mobility – even the @entity47 can escape more easily than the working class of 50 years ago			2
’ the @entity13 scale , produced with the help of the state - run @entity161 and academics from six universities , follows the 1980s teachings of @entity167 philosopher @entity166 , who said class depended on culture , taste and who you mix with as well as the kind of job you have			2
the report said : ‘ we have been able to discern a distinctive elite , whose sheer economic advantage sets it apart from other classes			0
' the fact this elite group is also shown to have the most privileged backgrounds is an important demonstration of the accentuation of social advantage at the top of @entity3 society			1
’ it said fewer than four out of ten people are counted as part of traditional working or middle classes			1
the @entity6 sketch from 1966 made fun of the @entity3 class system but was acclaimed for its simplicity			1
it featured @entity201 saying to a tall @entity202 : ‘ i look up to him because he is upper - class			0
’ he then added to small @entity205 : ‘ but i look down on him , because he is lower - class			0
i am middle - class			0
’ now click here or scroll down to take the test			0
experts : professor @entity34 ( left ) , of the @entity35 , carried out the research with professor @entity134 ( right ) , of the @entity135			0

study comes five decades after hit @entity6 sketch on three classes featuring @entity202 and the two *ronnies*
elite people make up six per cent and have savings of more than £ 140,000 and top university education
the ' @entity47 ' group sits at bottom of the classes and make up *15* per cent of @entity3 and earn £ *8,000* after *tax*
more than 160,000 people have taken part in @entity13 's @entity28
