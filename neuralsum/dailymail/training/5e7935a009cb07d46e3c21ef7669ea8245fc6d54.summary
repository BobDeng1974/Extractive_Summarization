useful as a mixer : @entity1 is the world ’s best - known brand			1
in 2012 , more than 1.8 billion people in more than 200 countries drank a @entity5 every day @entity1 is the world ’s best - known brand			1
in 2012 , more than 1.8 billion people in more than 200 countries drank a @entity5 every day — that ’s about one can or bottle for every four human beings on the planet			1
to create all the world ’s @entity5 takes 79 billion gallons of water every year , added to a secret syrup of sugar ( or high - fructose corn syrup ) , caffeine , coca leaf extract and flavourings			1
and an estimated eight thousand billion gallons of water is used to make the bottles and cans each year			1
when chemist @entity26 , from the @entity25 @entity24 , created the original @entity27 in 1886 in a pharmacy in the state capital @entity30 , he labelled it a ‘ brain tonic ’			1
the first advertisements promised that it ‘ @entity34 ’			1
@entity26 ’s inspiration was a popular concoction called @entity37 , created by @entity38 , a chemist from @entity39 in 1863			1
it consisted of @entity42 red wine infused with a sizeable pinch of cocaine , which was legal in most countries in the 19th century , and was said to give a galvanic energy boost			1
the anti-alcohol @entity47 in the @entity48 of the @entity25 was opposed to @entity37			2
@entity26 ’s version was alcohol - free , a soft soda drink made from sugar syrup spiced with citric acid , nutmeg , vanilla , @entity56 cinnamon oil and the two ingredients which gave @entity1 its name – kola nut powder to deliver a caffeine kick , and coca leaf extract which contained trace quantities of cocaine			1
the first @entity1 outlet was @entity66 ’s pharmacy in @entity30			1
@entity26 sold his undiluted syrup to @entity68 , and customers had their drinks mixed and served at the soda fountain on the first floor , at five cents a glass — sitting at the marble - topped counter , in a magnificent bar with floor - to - ceiling windows			1
all @entity26 ’s quack cures and fruit remedies could n’t cure his drug addiction			2
he died in 1888 , shortly after selling the formula for @entity1 and all his shares in the business to another @entity30 pharmacist , a workaholic methodist named @entity84			1
the first @entity5 bottles were all shapes and colours : clear , green , brown , straight - sided , squat and all other sorts			2
the classic design , known as the ‘ hobbleskirt ’ , that became the brand ’s signature did not appear until 1916			2
@entity84 ’s success did n’t go unnoticed			2
@entity96 businessman @entity95 launched a copycat product in 1893 , without the coca leaf extract			2
five years later , looking for a name to convey its fizzy appeal , he rebranded it			1
by 1903 , concerned at news reports of growing drug abuse in southern @entity25 states , the puritanical @entity84 had decided to remove all traces of cocaine from @entity5			2
his new formula contained ‘ de-cocainised ’ coca leaves and kola nut powder			2
it was known by the secret name , merchandise # 5			2
anti-drug campaigners attacked @entity25 ’s growing dependence on caffeine , and called for a national ban on caffeinated beverages			2
one @entity121 politician declared in 1909 : ‘ the reason they put this dope in @entity1 is to create a constant craving for more and thus sell the drink			1
’ caffeine prices shot up due to shortages in @entity129 , and in 1918 @entity1 halved the quotient to today ’s levels – a can contains about half the caffeine of a shot of espresso			1
the first glass of soda - fountain @entity5 in 1886 cost five cents — about 80p today			1
by 1950 , the cost of a bottle was about the same			2
a can of @entity5 in a supermarket is now about 70p			2
uniform : the first @entity5 bottles were all shapes and colours : clear , green , brown , straight - sided , squat and all other sorts			2
the classic ‘ hobbleskirt ’ design that became the brand ’s signature did not appear until 1916 in 1943 , @entity1 got the order that turned it into a global brand			1
general @entity154 , the future @entity25 president , dismissed fears over the wartime sugar shortage and placed a contract for six million bottles of @entity5 each month for the troops			0
the fast food chain @entity160 is @entity1 ’s biggest customer			1
their franchise outlets do n’t sell ready - mixed @entity5 in bottles or cans — they purchase the syrup and dilute it with soda dispensers , just as it was first sold in the 1880s			0
consumers started to demand decaffeinated drinks , especially coffee , in the @entity171			0
but that had a surprise bonus for @entity1 : the price of caffeine fell as demand plummeted , and the company was able to develop ‘ high - energy ’ drinks packed with the stimulant			1
which proved popular with students and all - night ravers			0
after prohibition in the early @entity184 , when breweries were struggling to keep up with demand for beer , the first steel cans were developed			0
but the acid in fizzy pop started to eat through the metal within weeks			0
now the cans have a protective polymer lining			0
the first @entity5 cans were manufactured in 1955 , for export to military bases			0
demand soared , and the company discovered huge savings in recycling costs : tins could be thrown away , but bottles had to be collected and returned to the depot , which meant paying for transport			0
the ring - pull can was a disaster for bottle - makers			0
in 1929 , there were 1,200 bottle plants in the @entity25 but by 1997 there were just 100 left			0
it was a disaster for beauty spots and beaches too , as consumers simply threw away their cans			0
‘ keeping @entity25 clean and beautiful is your job , ’ one tv advert scolded			0
@entity5 chairman @entity218 loathed litter , and became one of the first corporate eco-campaigners			0
in 1970 , he warned , ‘ unless all of us begin immediately to reverse the processes of impending self - destruction , which we have set in motion , this green land of ours will become a graveyard			0
’ to encourage people to pick up litter , @entity1 launched the ‘ @entity231 ’ campaign			1
posters featured a young woman bending over to clear up cans and rubbish			0
another billboard featured a @entity5 bottle with the slogan , ‘ if you love me , do n’t leave me			1
’ ingredients : to create all the world ’s @entity5 takes 79 billion gallons of water every year , added to a secret syrup of sugar ( or high - fructose corn syrup ) , caffeine , coca leaf extract and flavourings the trend towards fast food helped soft drink consumption to boom			1
in 1955 , the average @entity25 drank 11 gallons of fizz every year			0
by 2005 , that had more than tripled , to 36 gallons			0
and every gallon contains about a pound of high - calorie sweetener			0
that sweetener was not sugar			0
in fact , it was an artificial by - product from maize or sweetcorn , grown in the @entity264 with @entity25 government subsidies and turned into a brown syrupy gel that was sweeter than sucrose			0
it was called high - fructose corn syrup 55 , because it contained 55 per cent fructose and 45 per cent glucose ( table sugar is 50/50 )			0
the company ’s adverts have always celebrated the drink ’s popularity			1
in 1917 , billboards boasted how many bottles were drunk : ‘ @entity280 ’			0
by 1925 , it had doubled to ‘ @entity282 ’ — a mere third of a single percent of today ’s demand			0
but the most famous was never an official slogan — the pop song , i ’d like to buy @entity5 , was from a 1971 television ad .			0

whether you drink it with *clinking* ice or lace it with *rum* , the chances are you *'ve* had a glass of @entity1 . but love it or loathe it , how much do you know about the drink that has *dominated* the world for 150 years ?
