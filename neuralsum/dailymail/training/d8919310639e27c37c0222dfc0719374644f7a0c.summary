last week @entity32 authorities confirmed that a 65 - year - old @entity32 man had been diagnosed with the condition after returning from @entity35			1
yesterday they announced that a second man had been diagnosed with the disease after sharing a hospital room with the original patient			1
@entity1 assistant director - general @entity41 said there was no evidence so far that the virus was able to sustain ‘ generalised transmission in communities ’ - a scenario that would raise the spectre of a pandemic			0

‘ one focal point of the investigation at the moment is the hemodialysis unit in the hospital , ’ said @entity1 spokesman @entity94 in @entity95 , referring to equipment used on kidney and diabetes patients			2
‘ the association of this outbreak with a single health care facility suggests hospital - acquired transmission , ’ he said , noting that some patients under treatment for ailments may have had increased susceptibility to infection			0
