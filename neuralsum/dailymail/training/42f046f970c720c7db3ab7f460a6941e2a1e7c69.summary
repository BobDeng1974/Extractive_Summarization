by @entity0 published : 07:41 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 29 march 2013 across the @entity1 , millions have woken up to a bright and sunny first day of the @entity3 - and the clear weather is expected to continue for the weekend			1
but while the weather might be cheerful , the @entity1 is bare of any blooms , because of the spate of bad weather			1
the unseasonably cold winter has wreaked havoc on flower crops , causing them to bloom by up to four late			2
last year a couple were pictured basking in glorious sunshine amid of field vibrant daffodils in @entity16 - a stark contrast to the bleak picture this year a year later : the fields are bare of any brightly coloured flowers , after harsh weather conditions thwarted the usual blossoming of daffodils they were hampered further still as snow showers froze the ground and smothered any young shoots			2
after weeks of bitterly cold winds , driving rain and thick snowfall , the clouds have parted in time for the four - day break			0
the @entity33 has predicted sunny spells across the country , with temperatures of around 5c and @entity37			1
this is still below the average temperature for the end of march - which normally sees the thermometer creeping into double figures - but will be practically balmy in contrast to the wintry weather that has punished the @entity1 in recent weeks			1
@entity46 carries a barrel to the @entity48 , @entity48 , @entity49			0
the pub opens today for the first time in nine days after roads around were blocked by eight foot snow drifts the @entity33 has predicted milder weather conditions - just in time for an @entity3 trip to the pub cold feet : ducks walk around @entity1 's highest pub , the @entity48 , @entity48 , in @entity49 a digger continues to clear snow from the roads leading to @entity48 , @entity49 , which was covered in 8 ft high snow drifts cold easterly winds will remain firmly in charge of our weather but for the majority of the @entity1 it should be dry			1
however , until sunday the wind will be less strong and it will therefore feel a little less bitter			0
there will also be some sunshine with the best of this in western areas			0
but it will stay cold with frosty nights and sub-zero temperatures forecast for saturday night			1
@entity78 is expected to experience lows of -3c to @entity81 , and elsewhere the thermometer will drop to -1c and @entity83			2
@entity84 , met office chief forecaster , said : ' the prospect of drier and brighter weather will be a welcome relief for many but the prolonged low temperatures will mean that any lying snow will be slow to thaw			1
this family did n't let the chilly weather get in the way of their @entity3 stroll on the beach in @entity97 , @entity98 chilling out : a hopeful ice cream seller surveys the promenade at @entity97 , @entity101 , as walkers braved the cold temperature making the most of the bright weather : this group were clearly determined to enjoy the clear , sunny spells ' this will maintain sharp night - time frosts and a risk of ice , and people should be aware of the potential for tricky driving conditions if they are travelling this weekend			1
' @entity33 spokesman @entity115 said : ' there will be an east and west split , as there will be some showers along the east coast of the country - but nothing like the last few days			1
' the sunniest weather will be across the west and north west of the country			1
' because there is a band of high pressure over the @entity1 , we will have more settled weather conditions			1
' families wrapped up today to go punting on the @entity132 as the coldest march in 50 years draws to a close			1
many huddled together under blankets as the freezing conditions continue in @entity1 over the @entity3 weekend			1
wrapped up tourists punt down the @entity132 , as the @entity3 weekend is set to be dry in many areas families wrapped up today to go punting on the @entity132 as the forecast promised milder weather almost two million brits are expected to fly away this @entity3 to escape the @entity144 chill - around 30 per cent more than average			1
there has also been a rush for last - minute holidays to sunny climes , such as @entity150 and @entity151			2
airports and roads across the @entity1 are unaffected by the annual @entity3 crush , as many people take advantage of the weekend to make long trips			1
there are no reported long delays , and flight departures remain largely on time			0
ms @entity115 explained why the recent weather has been so horrendous			2
the last relief flight was made in @entity164 , @entity165 last night , to try and save stranded animals a ewe with her lamb , which is protected by a plastic anorak from the winter chill , as they rest in a field of snow near @entity174 , @entity175 she said : ' march is usually a month of contrasts but this march we have predominantly had cold weather as an area of high pressure has become established to the north of the @entity1			1
' this is what we call " blocked " weather , and , with low pressure to the south of the @entity1 the resultant easterly winds have brought cold air from @entity191 / western @entity190 / @entity189			1
' it has certainly been prolonged and the effects of low temperatures , frost , ice and more recently snow have caused significant impacts to travel and infrastructure , with limited periods of quieter weather to take stock			1
' there are many factors that could be contributing to the persistence of the blocked weather , such as @entity208 / @entity207 , @entity210 sea ice , solar uv output , the @entity212 , and others			2
' these do nâ€™t work in isolation , but all combine to influence climate on both regional and global scales			0
' it may also be a very natural thing as once a blocking pattern sets up , it can last for a number of days or even weeks			0
' this is especially true if the block is particularly well established vertically through the atmosphere , as it takes a lot for weather patterns to displace it			2
' a ray of sunshine ! @entity231 , 14 months , enjoys a break in the weather at @entity234 , @entity235 last night an @entity236 makes the final drop of emergency food supplies for animals cut - off by the deep snow drifts in @entity164 , @entity165			2
all air support has now been withdrawn from the relief operation to animals stranded in the snow in @entity245			0
@entity236 and @entity247 helicopters had been dropping emergency food supplies to farms in high - ground areas of counties @entity251 and @entity165 , but the @entity253 said it was now re-directing resources to the ground			0
@entity257 mla @entity256 has said it is too soon to end aerial support : ' this decision by the @entity253 minister will cost farmers more livestock			0
' the helicopters made food drops to thousands of stranded animals , which were mostly in the @entity268 which has suffered from severe snow fall			0
but the department defended its decision and said efforts were being re-focused on the ground			0
@entity274 and her children @entity276 and @entity277 walk past banks of snow on @entity280 near @entity281 , @entity282 good friday fun : cyclists navigate a snowy road lined with tall banks of ice and snow near @entity289 , @entity290 melting away : the scene near @entity292 , @entity282 shows the green fields slowly thawing a spokesman for the @entity295 ( @entity295 ) said : ' over this week we have worked tirelessly to assist many farmers who have experienced difficulties due to the recent severe weather			2
' we have assessed the situation on a continuing basis and air support has been stood down for today			0
' given that road access has been dealt with we are now redirecting our resources from aerial support to ground support , and over the next few days we will continue to offer farmers help to move their fodder to inaccessible stock			0
' since monday , 22 helicopter flights have delivered 46 fodder drops to animals isolated on high ground in the @entity314 and @entity315 of @entity251			0
a further 45 farmers have transported feed to remote areas using @entity295 's @entity320 vehicles			0
the milder conditions will bring a huge relief to one couple , who had to abandon their home after they became snowed in			2
@entity328 pilgrims carry the @entity329 over the snow covered fields to head to a @entity280 service at @entity333 near @entity16 determined cyclists head out on a cycle path through the snow in @entity49 the big thaw : thick icicles dangle from a bush in a country lane in @entity341 , @entity342 the recent cold weather snap has created a a stunning effect of icicles in all different shapes and colours @entity347 and partner @entity348 were greeted with a huge when they opened the front door of their farmhouse in a remote part of @entity354			1
they had to dig their way out after drifts almost reached the top of the door frame			0
with food and fuel running low after days of being cut off , and with no sign of a thaw , the couple decided to leave their isolated home near @entity367 , near @entity368 , and travel on foot through the snow - swept terrain			0
on wednesday , @entity347 and @entity348 packed rucksacks full of provisions and clothes as they left their home to escape the @entity210 conditions			0
they are now staying in @entity378 until conditions improve			0
