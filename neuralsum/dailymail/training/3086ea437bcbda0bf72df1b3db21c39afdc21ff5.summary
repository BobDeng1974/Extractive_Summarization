unfair : legally blind @entity16 disability discrimination commissioner said he felt like he was under ' curfew ' in @entity5 with audible traffic signals switched off overnight the @entity23 , the country 's largest , has angered @entity25 , after they switched off pings at intersections between 9.30pm and 6.30am to satisfy @entity29 residents unhappy about the noise			1
mr @entity14 was in @entity5 at the weekend for a meeting about information services for the blind and vision impaired			2
' effectively we were on a curfew because at 9.30 at night the audible traffic signals are turned off and they do n't go back on until 6.30 in the morning , ' he told @entity37			2
' if we were out later than that at night , or up and about before 6.30 , which i often am because i take my guide dog for a walk , we did n't have the benefit of signals to cross roads			0
' curfew : the pings go silent in the @entity29 between 9.30pm and 6.30am mr @entity14 says he 's never come across the situation in other capital cities , and residents must know there 's an element of noise associated with living in @entity53			1

asked why the council should n't have signals running around the clock , mr @entity59 said : ' it comes down to balancing the demands of use of those intersections with the concerns of residents as well			0
