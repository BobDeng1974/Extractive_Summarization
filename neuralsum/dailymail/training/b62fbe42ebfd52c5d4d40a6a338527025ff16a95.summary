by @entity0 for @entity1 she 's a mother of two who met her husband @entity3 , also a father of two , on an internet dating site and married him just a year later			1
but with two separate families to ' blend ' and a pair of former spouses to factor in , making it work has n't always been easy			1
here author and parenting expert @entity0 reveals how she turned her very modern marriage into a loving blended family			1
happy family : @entity14 with her husband and children at a @entity17 all grown up : julie with her husband @entity3 and their children shortly after their wedding in 2003 with less than a year to go until two of our children head to university , my husband @entity3 and i have been reflecting on our blended family , began in a backyard ceremony on a sunny september day in 2003			1
the day we married , ' @entity32 ' ( my son and @entity3 ’s eldest daughter ) were six and ' @entity36 ' ( my daughter and @entity3 ’s youngest daughter ) were three and two , respectively			0
now , the bigs are 17 and poised to move away for university after graduation next june , and @entity43 ( who now prefer not to be called ' little ' ) are 15 and 14			0
we ’ve been together so long now that the internet dating site that brought us together boasts over a million marriages			1
i ’m not sure how many of those involve children but i would guess the answer is plenty since the internet is one of the few meeting places single parents can find time to travel to			1
certainly , @entity3 and @entity55 made some mistakes in combining our two families			1
but , we came up with some good ideas early on and i think those outweighed the errors			0
from the start , we found ways to make things ' our family ’s '			1
my children are with us full - time , but my stepchildren are only here half the time and attend school according to their mother ’s address , not ours			1
this meant that from the beginning , our city felt divided , and two kids were always leaving our house , knowing the rest of us were still there			0
so , @entity3 and i made the big decision to buy a weekend home on a small lake a few hours north of town and we spent most weekends and all holidays at ' our cottage ' , a place we arrived at , and left , together every time -- all six of us			1
we quickly attached a number of family traditions to the cottage -- family hikes and snowshoe expeditions , wearing goofy orange hats during hunting season			2
friends : ' @entity36 ' were encouraged to enjoy each others company by their parents as were their siblings close : @entity0 's son and @entity3 's eldest daughter , both 17 , will leave home to go to university next year these were all things we could easily have done in the city but @entity3 and i decided to make them cottage - only treats , as part of our strategy to make the place seem more magical , and more ' ours '			1
we developed some family traditions in the city , too			2
we live in @entity111 , where the @entity112 is located , and where @entity3 earned his graduate degree			0
he very quickly passed his fanaticism about @entity17 sports on to me and the four kids , and our family still loves belting out the fight song and dressing in team colours on game day , whether we have tickets to attend or not			2
we got a family dog , too , and @entity125 the arthritic rescued labrador became an instant source of shared love and concern			2
we also joined a church none of us had been to before , so we ’d have something in town that was ' ours ' outside the house			0
another family tradition we started was our monthly ' family meeting ' , which begin with each person taking a turn to say something nice about everyone else			2
next , we opened the floor to whoever had an issue to discuss , and in our family ’s meetings , these tended to fall into two categories : one , all four kids lobbying for something and two , one or more raising an issue of perceived unfairness , often with blended family undertones			1
category one discussions led to household changes and often to more family traditions			2
the @entity156 or @entity36 , or all four combined , lobbied for things like later bedtimes and raises in their allowance			0
to our delight , they also came up with terrific ideas like spending each child ’s 13th birthday in @entity164 and the invention of ' @entity166 ' where @entity3 takes each child out alone for dinner and an activity			0
category two discussions also led to helpful changes , either in the kids ’ perceptions or in @entity3 ’s and my behaviour			0
the meeting ground rules ( take turns , use ' i ' messages ) allowed for respectful and productive discussion , even about thorny stepfamily issues			0
altogether : @entity0 and @entity3 made a point of ensuring all four children were present for family holidays and treats we never split up along biological lines			1
if we had to take two cars to an event , or divide up over a dinnertime or a weekend , we took care never to split up into ' us ' and ' them '			0
instead , i would take @entity36 while @entity3 took @entity32 , or we ’d divide on gender lines			0
related , we never ( and i mean never ) did any big , fun thing unless all four kids were present			0
mostly , we did n’t want any of them to ever feel left out but also we liked that the subliminal message would be that fun things happen when we ’re all together			0
as for the things we did wrong , i suppose that will make a terrific article for our children to write one day			2
but , no matter how long a list of missteps they might list , our failures were inadvertent			2
if we got some things wrong , it was n’t for lack of effort , or caring , or love			0
