there were both positives and negatives to be taken from @entity4 's defeat to @entity5 in their @entity7 opener			1
the boldness shown by @entity10 @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 in attack chimed with the adventurous approach demanded by the nation			1
but weaknesses were exposed at the back when @entity5 scored their two goals , suggesting @entity19 must find greater balance in the team , while @entity23 's performance came in for criticism			1
ahead of thursday 's match with @entity28 , our reporters have selected the team and the tactics they would choose for this must - win match			2
see if you agree and join in the debate in the comments box below			0
@entity35 : @entity4 first picks : the @entity4 team that played against @entity5 in @entity37 on saturday night @entity38 @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ; @entity44 ; @entity9 , @entity45 , @entity46 ; @entity11 , @entity47 the team needs balance to offer better protection to the back four			1
@entity44 can help with that if he stays anchored , while @entity45 ’s engine and experience can help the youngsters control midfield better than against @entity5			2
plus we have @entity47 back in the position he should play , which would support @entity11			2
@entity59 @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity60 , @entity42 , @entity61 ; @entity44 , @entity62 , @entity46 ; @entity9 , @entity11 , @entity63 at centre forward			2
he ’s scored 39 international goals			0
he ’s up against @entity66 , who is 33 and has just been given the boot by @entity68			0
play him with his back to goal and then build pace all around him , with @entity11 and @entity9 running off him right and left			1
@entity46 would come in to help create more chances and to win free kicks around the box			0
and i ’m backing @entity61 to score from one			0
he was exposed in the first game , but he ’s an outstanding left back			0
mixed bag : @entity23 helped set up @entity4 's goal , scored by @entity11 , but otherwise endured a frustrating evening out on the left wing against @entity5 @entity82 : @entity46 looked lively after coming off the bench against @entity5 and is in contention to start against @entity28 @entity85 @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity44 , @entity62 ; @entity9 , @entity47 , @entity12 ; @entity11			1
i 'd go with the team that is being talked about , with @entity47 through the middle and @entity12 and @entity9 wide			1
i 'm nervous about the back four but i do n't see much of an alternative			0
@entity91 @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity44 ; @entity9 , @entity47 , @entity12 ; @entity11 @entity47 because the threat from @entity28 's midfield is nothing like that from @entity5 's			1
however , @entity47 , @entity9 and @entity12 to rotate positions			2
@entity98 , if fit , should be an early change and then @entity46			2
decision time : @entity19 must decide whether to stick with the @entity4 side that lost 2 - 1 to @entity5 on saturday night or tweak the team and tactics for the @entity28 clash good showing : @entity12 looked lively on the right - hand side but could potentially lose his place if @entity19 switches around the midfield comeback : @entity98 's return from injury gives @entity4 another attacking option @entity113 @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity60 , @entity42 , @entity61 ; @entity44 , @entity62 ; @entity12 , @entity9 , @entity47 ; @entity11 the centre of @entity28 ’s defence struggles with direct running so keep @entity9 through the middle with @entity12 right running at @entity118			1
@entity47 starts on the left but you make good use of the bench			0
@entity28 tired badly against @entity123 so you want @entity125 and the @entity126 getting a good half - hour			0
@entity127 @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity60 , @entity42 , @entity61 ; @entity44 , @entity62 ; @entity12 , @entity9 , @entity47 ; @entity11 do n't see a reason to change the personnel			1
that 's about as good as we are			0
we could tighten it defensively but that would be at a cost and it would be a shame to step back from the attacking edge everyone enjoyed against @entity5			0
i hope the team is unchanged but with more flexibility and rotation within the three behind @entity11			0
and more forward movement from @entity62			0
back of the net : @entity11 turns in @entity23 's cross from the left to bring @entity4 back to level terms against @entity5 @entity147 @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity44 , @entity62 ; @entity9 , @entity47 , @entity12 ; @entity11 play @entity47 through the middle or not at all , and give @entity61 more protection by using the hard - working @entity12 in front of him on the left			1
i 'm not sure @entity4 need two holding midfielders , so i would encourage @entity62 to sit slightly further forward than @entity44 , too			0
@entity156 @entity155 - @entity154 @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity44 , @entity62 ; @entity9 , @entity47 , @entity157 ; @entity11 initially advocated dropping @entity47 , but ca n't help feeling this week 's debate will bring the best from him , so long as he plays centrally			1
@entity9 has the versatility to move and @entity157 proved himself on the left with @entity162			1
flying : @entity157 is also in contention for a starting berth after coming off the bench in @entity37 @entity166 @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity44 , @entity62 ; @entity9 , @entity46 , @entity12 ; @entity11 the @entity47 debate is getting boring now , so let ’s give him a rest and play @entity46 behind @entity11			1
@entity12 is more used to that left - sided role than his @entity172 teammate , and @entity47 can be used as an impact sub after an hour if things are n’t going well			2
video drop the @entity47 agenda - @entity45			0

biggest question is where to *deploy* @entity23 in thursday night 's game with @entity28
@entity172 *striker* played wide left in saturday 's defeat to @entity5
he could be *pushed* up front with @entity11 or just behind
@entity9 and @entity12 likely to keep their places , but @entity188 could come in
@entity98 fit again and @entity157 has chance
