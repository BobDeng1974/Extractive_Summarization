mind - bending ‘ psychotronic ’ guns that can effectively turn people into zombies have been given the go - ahead by @entity5 president @entity4			1
the futuristic weapons – which will attack the central nervous system of their victims – are being developed by the country ’s scientists			1
they could be used against @entity5 ’s enemies and , perhaps , its own dissidents by the end of the decade			1
fire : @entity4 , seen using a traditional pistol , has new weapons in his sights sources in @entity21 say mr @entity4 has described the guns , which use electromagnetic radiation like that found in microwave ovens , as ‘ entirely new instruments for achieving political and strategic goals ’			2
mr @entity4 added : ‘ such high - tech weapons systems will be comparable in effect to nuclear weapons , but will be more acceptable in terms of political and military ideology			2
’ plans to introduce the super- weapons were announced quietly last week by @entity5 defence minister @entity35 , fulfilling a little - noticed election campaign pledge by president - elect @entity4			1
plans to introduce the super- weapons were announced quietly last week by @entity5 defence minister @entity35 mr @entity35 said : ‘ the development of weaponry based on new physics principles – direct - energy weapons , geophysical weapons , wave - energy weapons , genetic weapons , psychotronic weapons , and so on – is part of the state arms procurement programme for 2011 - 2020			1
’ specific proposals on developing the weapons are due to be drawn up before december by a new @entity50			2
research into electromagnetic weapons has been secretly carried out in the @entity53 and @entity5 since the @entity54			1
but now it appears mr @entity4 has stolen a march on the @entity53			2
@entity58 details of the @entity5 gun have not been revealed			1
however , previous research has shown that low - frequency waves or beams can affect brain cells , alter psychological states and make it possible to transmit suggestions and commands directly into someone ’s thought processes			0
high doses of microwaves can damage the functioning of internal organs , control behaviour or even drive victims to suicide			0
@entity76 , head of the @entity77 in @entity21 , said : ‘ this is a highly serious weapon			0
‘ when it was used for dispersing a crowd and it was focused on a man , his body temperature went up immediately as if he was thrown into a hot frying pan			0
still , we know very little about this weapon and even special forces guys can hardly cope with it			0
’ the long - term effects are not known , but two years ago a former major in the @entity5 foreign intelligence agency , the @entity88 , died in @entity89 after making claims about such a weapons programme to @entity92			1
@entity93 , 43 , claimed he was a victim of weapons which he said were ‘ many times more powerful than in the @entity96 films ’			0
mr @entity93 died after falling from a @entity98 tower block with his wife and stepson in march 2010			0
while his death was assumed to be suicide , his family fear there was foul play			0
last night the @entity106 declined to comment .			0

could be used against @entity5 *'s* enemies and perhaps its own dissidents
