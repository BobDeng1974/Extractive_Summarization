@entity8 , 40 , is under investigation by police after making the accusation in @entity13 messages			1
the families have spent years trying to discover the truth behind their babies ’ deaths at @entity18 in @entity19 , where up to 14 are thought to have died needlessly			2
@entity8 , 40 , was handling cases of babies who died at @entity18 on behalf of coroner			1
she is alleged to have sent them @entity13 messages telling them to rethink their ' witch - hunt ' they were shocked when @entity26 , who has handled their cases on behalf of the coroner , sent them messages warning against continuing their campaign			1

her comments came after the @entity65 ’s head of legal services , @entity64 , was suspended over allegations she tried to block @entity59 ’s inquest			0
the families have spent years campaigning to find out how their children died at this hospital in @entity19 it emerged last week that mrs @entity64 wrote an email in 2009 suggesting the coroner might be ‘ nudged ’ away from holding the hearing			2
the revelation provoked an outcry from the families , whom @entity26 then contacted on @entity13 , writing : ‘ you guys know how much i care about you and all that you have been through but i promise you that @entity64 has n’t and would n’t do anything to cover up or influence a coroner ’s inquiry			1
‘ a crusade for truth and change is turning into a witch - hunt			0
