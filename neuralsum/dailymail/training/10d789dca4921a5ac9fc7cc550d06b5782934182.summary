by @entity0 published : 12:12 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 12:58 est , 27 january 2014 a female police officer is being hailed as @entity4 ’s shortest female copper - standing at just 5ft 1in tall			1
@entity5 , 21 , spent two years volunteering as a special constable before joining the full - time force			2
she graduated from @entity9 on january 17 and is now a @entity11 police officer - where one of her colleagues is 6ft 7in			0
the minimum height requirement for police , which stood in place for years in the @entity4 , has been scrapped			1
@entity18 and @entity19 are two of the @entity11 's latest recruits			1
she is the smallest officer in the @entity4 's largest force , towered over by fellow new officer @entity19 who is 18 inches taller			1
@entity4 ’s shortest copper is pc @entity23 , 29 , of @entity25 and @entity26 , who stands at 5ft			1
a spokesperson for the @entity11 police said : ' pc @entity18 is attached to @entity30 , aged 21 - she is 5ft 1in tall			1
' she joined the police after two years as a @entity31 in @entity32			0
' @entity19 is attached to @entity33 - he 's 30 and 6ft 7 in tall			2
in the past , male recruits had to be at least 5ft 10in and women 5ft 4in to join many forces			0
but from the early 1990s , height restrictions have gradually been removed			2
now , there are no @entity4 forces which still operate a minimum height requirement			0
it has been made illegal to discriminate against - or reject - applicants on the basis of their height			0
police say the stringent assessment procedures used during recruitment of police officers tests many skills , including a physical ability to do the job			0
it is the same across the @entity53 , where the country of @entity55 once imposed minimum height requirements for police centuries ago , raising them over the decades as the average size of @entity59 rose .			0

the long and short of it : @entity5 stands at just 5ft 1in tall
she 's now being hailed as @entity4 's shortest *policewoman*
she 's a full 18 inches shorter than her @entity11 colleague @entity19
there are no height restrictions for the police now because it 's *deemed* as discriminatory
