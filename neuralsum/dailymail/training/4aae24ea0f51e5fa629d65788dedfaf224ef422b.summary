when next season ’s fixtures are released in june there is a strong possibility that neither @entity4 or @entity5 will be in the casting their eyes towards the @entity7			1
@entity9 ’s side recorded their fifth win in a row to extend their unbeaten run to 14 games as they look set for promotion in may			1
but @entity5 could well be heading in the opposite direction after falling to their fourth successive home defeat to leave them hovering nervously above the relegation zone			2
in reality this game was over and the points heading back to the @entity23 before half time after goals from @entity25 and @entity26 put @entity4 in a commanding position at the break			2
@entity26 celebrates giving @entity4 a 2 - 0 lead in the first half as they win their fifth on the bounce @entity5 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : @entity33 5 , @entity34 5 ( @entity35 46 5 ) , @entity36 6 ( @entity37 67 6 ) , @entity38 7 , @entity39 6 , @entity40 6 , @entity41 6 , @entity42 4 , @entity43 6.5 , @entity44 5 ( @entity45 56 6 ) , @entity46 6			1
subs not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 booked @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity52 , @entity43 sent off : @entity42 @entity4 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 : @entity53 6 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6 , @entity57 6 , @entity58 6 ( @entity59 87 ) , @entity26 7 , @entity60 6 , @entity61 6.5 ( @entity62 69 6 , @entity63 7.5 , @entity64 7 ( @entity65 58 6 ) subs not used : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70			1
goals : @entity64 32 ( pen ) , @entity26 42 booked : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity63 referee : @entity74 7 attendance : 10,407 it would have been understandable if the travelling fans had been a little nervous having thrown away a 2 - 0 half time lead to the same side a month ago			1
but there was to be no mistake this time and @entity4 manager @entity9 was pleased his side learnt from their mistakes			0
@entity9 said : ‘ it was a big win for us			0
whenever you come to @entity5 you know it ’s going to be difficult			2
it was very hostile and we dealt with that challenge well			0
‘ i did n’t feel we were ever under pressure			0
the goals came at good times and we took them both well			0
‘ we needed to learn from the previous game ( in november )			0
second half we were professional and without being at our very best it was a comfortable win			0
’ @entity4 stamped their authority on the game and took the lead just after the half hour mark when @entity44 brought down @entity57 on the edge of the area and referee @entity74 had no hesitation in pointing to the spot - despite protests from the @entity5 players that the foul happened outside the box			1
@entity44 's ( right ) sliding tackle on @entity57 ( left ) earned the @entity111 a penalty for their opening goal , slotted by @entity64 ( not pictured ) @entity64 stepped up and put @entity4 ahead despite the best efforts of @entity33			1
and @entity5 were cursing their luck again 10 minutes later when @entity63 broke free of the offside trap and played a low cross which found @entity26 , who took his chance to shoot at the second attempt on the turn to double @entity4 ’s lead and score his fifth goal in five league games			1
@entity125 tried to change things again in the second half throwing on veteran striker @entity35 , but @entity4 were professional without being spectacular and kept the ball well			2
the game was up 10 minutes from time when @entity5 were reduced to 10 men after @entity42 was shown a straight red card for an apparent stamp on @entity63 after the @entity4 man had fouled him			1
the win extends @entity4 ’s lead at the top of the table to four points but @entity9 is keeping his feet firmly on the ground			0
@entity4 's @entity63 flips @entity5 's @entity42 in the air @entity42 reacts and is shown a straight red card for an apparent stamp on @entity63 with 10 minutes remaining @entity9 added : ‘ after finishing 10th last season we hoped to be in and around the top six but we are very pleased where we are			1
’ at the final whistle the cheers of the travelling supporters were drowned out by the boos from the home fans and pressure is certainly mounting on @entity125			0
the @entity5 manager said : ‘ for the first goal i expected a free - kick to be given , not a penalty			2
‘ you ’ve got to be 100 per cent sure , but the referee is 200 per cent wrong because it was outside the box			0
‘ i felt we deserved more than we got out there and a lack of confidence and spread quickly and we need to stop the rot because we want to stay in this division			0

@entity64 scored a penalty after @entity57 was fouled
@entity26 made it 2 - 0 for the @entity7 leaders in the 42nd minute
@entity5 's @entity42 sent off after *clash* with striker @entity63
*cherries* have now won five in a row and are unbeaten in 14 league games
