tweets from accounts that users do not follow will now appear in their @entity4 timeline , in a move that has angered users worldwide			1
the new feature has been confirmed today on @entity4 's support page after users first reported the appearance of content from other accounts last week , with many believing it was just an experiment			1
normally , a user 's @entity4 timeline is filled by posts from accounts the user follows , as well as retweets from those accounts			1
these are based on the types of accounts the user is already following and who those accounts follow			2
now posts from these users will also appear on their main timeline			0
as well as this , the social network will find content that is popular or relevant based on the user 's previous tweets			1
these posts will be published on their timeline , regardless of whether the @entity51 is being followed			0
@entity4 will also republish posts based on how people in a network are interacting with it			1
the new feature will mean that ' favourited tweets ' - traditionally a way of saving a tweet without making them public - will start to appear in users ' timelines			1
but this has now changed , as the site 's support page explained			0
' additionally , when we identify a @entity4 , an account to follow , or other content that 's popular or relevant , we may add it to your timeline , ' a statement on the official site said			1
' this means you will sometimes see tweets from accounts you do n't follow			1
' we select each tweet using a variety of signals , including how popular it is and how people in your network are interacting with it			0
' our goal is to make your home timeline even more relevant and interesting			0
' the new feature will also mean that tweets that are ' favourited ' - traditionally a way of saving a tweet without making them public - will start to appear in other users ' timelines who have n't favourited the tweet			1
. but it has always been possible to view favourites by using the @entity31 section of the @entity4 app or website			0
the change is seen by some as an attempt to increase user interest as the site looks to close the gap on @entity102			1
' our goal is to make your home timeline even more relevant and interesting , ' @entity4 said the new feature will also mean that ' favourited tweets ' - traditionally a way of saving a tweet without making them public - will start to appear in users ' timelines as well			1
swathes of @entity4 users have expressed annoyance at the roll - out of the new feature the change is seen by some as an attempt to increase user interest as the site looks to close the gap on @entity102 in user numbers			1
as of march this year , @entity4 had 241 million active users globally , with more than 15 million in the @entity121			0
in comparison , rival social network @entity102 has more than one billion users active each month			0
the move has proved unpopular with users so far , with many taking to the site to voice their frustration at the new , unwanted content appearing within their timeline			2
one user from @entity134 tweeted to complain he was seeing content related to his deceased stepfather now appearing on his profile			0
the move has proved unpopular with users so far , with many taking to the site to voice their frustration at the new , unwanted content appearing within their timeline for the moment , the change does not affect third - party @entity4 apps like @entity144 , which are operated by independent software and present user timelines in alternative ways , as well as offering different features			1
but it is likely the apps will absorb this new feature eventually thanks to their connection with @entity4 's main servers			2
' @entity4 purists will accuse today 's update of the platform moving one step closer to being @entity102 , as it shifts from personally - curated content to recommended content , ' said @entity159 , a technology expert from @entity160			1
' however , this change makes sense for @entity4 as a company as it will make the social network more accessible to enterprises looking to promote their products , just as the introduction of images appearing in timelines did several months ago			2
' it will be interesting to see how everyday tweeters adapt to this new feature and whether or not they think will more carefully about how they favourite a tweet			0
' swathes of @entity4 users have expressed annoyance at the roll - out of an experimental new feature			2
users of the social network have reported seeing tweets favourited by other people in their own timeline			2
in addition to this , some members have complained that their feed shows tweets alerting them that an account they follow has followed a new account			0
currently , only retweets posted by accounts that someone has personally chosen to follow show up on timelines , as well as advertisements , according to the @entity196			0
members have voiced their anger over the ‘ experiment ’ , with many explaining that they were never given the option to opt out of sharing content they had marked as a ' favourite ' with their followers			0
one user said : ' i really , really hate all these new @entity4 things ' , while another vented : ' if i wanted to see what my friends favourite , i could look			2
i neither want nor need it added to my timeline			0

@entity4 timeline is normally filled by posts from accounts a user follows
now it will feature posts from popular accounts and *trending* content
new feature means that ' favourited ' tweets will also appear in timelines
@entity4 hopes the move will increase user interest and close gap the with @entity102 on user numbers
