theory : mathematics professor @entity1 says it is better to arrive later at an airport and risk missing a flight , rather than wait for hours for a plane it is a question that can leave many holidaymakers baffled			1
is it better to arrive at the airport early and while away hours in @entity10 , or set off late and risk missing the flight ? now a mathematician says he has hit upon the formula for the optimal time to arrive at the airport that minimises wasted time at the airport , yet also ensures passengers will only have a one or two percent chance of missing their plane			1
according to @entity21 mathematics professor @entity1 , every hour a passenger spends at the airport rather than in the comfort of their own home is a negative unit			1
in his new book how not to be wrong - @entity29 , prof @entity1 instead recommends that holidaymakers and business travellers leave it later to catch their flights , even if that means potentially missing the plane , so as not to amass too many wasted hours over the course of a lifetime			1
former child prodigy @entity38 , who teaches mathematics at @entity40 , says the optimal time to arrive ' depends on how you personally feel about the relative merits of missing planes and wasting time , ' according to the @entity45			0
' but if in the course of a lifetime you never miss a flight then you may not have the best strategy			0
' in the book , released on tuesday , prof @entity1 sets out to show how mathematics can impact on , and explain , a host of every day occurrences			2
whiling away the hours : prof @entity1 says every hour spent waiting in the lounge or wandering through @entity10 is a negative unit prof @entity1 argues that ' if you 've never missed a flight , you 're not doing it right '			2
he says that although passengers who arrive at the airport three hours before their flight will never miss it , they will spend numerous ' negative units ' of time waiting in a lounge , or wandering through @entity10			1
the professor says the optimal time to arrive gives passengers a one or two percent chance of missing the plane , but reduces this wasted time			1
how long passengers are prepared to leave it is up to them , says prof @entity1 he tackles a number of dilemmas and issues including why tall parents have shorter children , what is the best way to get rich by playing the lottery and why women might struggle to find their perfect man			2
prof @entity1 also weighs in to a debate on how governments will never be able to completely cut out money wasted , as doing so will result in politicians spending too much time fighting against waste			0
' you ca n't do calculus by common sense , ' he writes			0
' but calculus is still derived from common sense - @entity93 took our physical intuition about objects moving in straight lines , formalised it , and then built on top of that formal structure a universal mathematical description of motion			0
' once you have @entity93 's theory in hand , you can apply it to problems that would make your head spin if you had no equations to help you			0

@entity1 says passengers should leave it later to catch a flight
@entity21 professor says risk of missing plane *outweighs* wasted ' negative units '
