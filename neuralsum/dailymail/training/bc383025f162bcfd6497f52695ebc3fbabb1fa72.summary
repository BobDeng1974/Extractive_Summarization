by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 13:37 est , 21 january 2013 beach ball sized spiked rovers could soon be rolling around the surface of @entity4 , if a groundbreaking new design for rolling rovers if given the go - ahead			1
@entity13 researchers , in collaboration with @entity10 's @entity9 and the @entity11 , have designed the ' hedgehog ' probes			1
dropped from a mothership , each rover would hop , tumble and bound across the cratered , lopsided moon , relaying information about its origins , as well as its soil and other surface materials			1
the rovers would drop from a mother spaceship , and then be able to ' hop ' across the surface , before tumbling to their final locations and take measurements from the surface an entire mission would last two to three years , and just flying to @entity4 would take the surveyor about two years			1
then the initial reconnaissance phase , during which the @entity32 would map the terrain , would last a few months			2
the mothership would release each of the five or six hedgehogs several days apart , allowing scientists enough time to decide where to release the next hedgehog			2
developed by @entity43 , an assistant professor in @entity13 's @entity44 and @entity45 , the system consists of a mother spacecraft , known as the @entity32 , and the rovers it houses , called ' hedgehogs '			1
the @entity32 , a coffee - table - sized vehicle flanked by two umbrella - shaped solar panels , would orbit around @entity4 throughout the mission			1
the researchers have already constructed a prototype			2
the team say the hedgehogs could be the first step to exploring @entity4 ' it 's a piece of technology that 's needed before any more expensive type of exploration is considered , ' @entity43 said ' before sampling we need to know where to land			1
' we need to deploy rovers to acquire info about the surface			1
' the surveyor , or mother ship , would release only one hedgehog at a time			0
together , the mothership and hedgehogs would work together to determine the hedgehog 's position and orientation			0
using this information , they would map a trajectory , which the mother craft would then command the hedgehog to travel			2
the hedgehogs do not have wheels , as do the current @entity84 rovers			1
instead they rely on three rotating discs enclosed within each hedgehog , with each disc pointing in a different direction			0
the rover is controlled via three flywheels , and is powered by solar panels on its exterior a prototype of the hedgehog the team has already built			0
they plan to test future versions on parabolic flights to simulate zero gravity the spiky explorers would relay scientific measurements back to the @entity32 , which would forward the data to researchers on @entity105			2
based on their analysis of the data , the scientists would direct the mothership to the next hedgehog deployment site			0
an entire mission would last two to three years , and just flying to @entity4 would take the surveyor about two years			1
then the initial reconnaissance phase , during which the @entity32 would map the terrain , would last a few months			0
the mothership would release each of the five or six hedgehogs several days apart , allowing scientists enough time to decide where to release the next hedgehog			0
for many decisions , @entity43 's system renders human control unnecessary			0
' it 's the next level of autonomy in space , ' he said			0
an image of @entity4 made with @entity10 's @entity129 an early example of the mission the spiky rovers could take to confirm @entity4 ' origins , @entity43 's group plans to deploy most of the hybrids near an area known as @entity137			1
besides providing a gravity ' sweet spot ' where the mother craft can stably hover between @entity84 and @entity4			1
the crater also exposes the moon 's inner layers			0
the team has already built two prototypes , and plans to test the hedgehogs in a reduced - gravity aircraft , also known as a ' vomit comet , ' essentially an airplane flying a parabolic path			0
the plane climbs and then pitches downward , at which point it begins a low - gravity free - fall lasting about 25 seconds before pulling up again			0
during each parabola , the researchers will test a different hedgehog maneuver			2
a test of the @entity32 will likely take place in two to four years			0
@entity43 hopes that a @entity32 mission , which could occur within the next 10 - 20 years , will bring scientists closer to a human mission to @entity84			1
' the bottom line is that there is a growing interest in the exploration of small bodies , ' he said .			0

@entity13 and @entity10 developing programme to send the round rovers to @entity4
each 50cm wide craft would be able to roll around the surface , and help researchers understand more about @entity4 and @entity84
