@entity0 has become the most overcrowded major country in @entity2			1
population growth is so rapid that four times as many people will soon be crammed in as @entity6 and twice as many as @entity7			0
@entity0 has overtaken the @entity8 to become second only to tiny @entity9 as the most densely populated nation in the @entity11			1
squeeze : @entity0 has overtaken the @entity8 to become the most densely populated major nation in the @entity11 over the next 30 years the gap will widen because @entity7 , @entity6 and @entity14 will either decline or grow only slowly			1
the @entity16 figures – based on data from the @entity18 and @entity11 statistical agencies – show the huge impact of @entity22 ’s open - door immigration policy			1
by 2046 , an estimated 494 people will be squeezed into every square kilometre of @entity0 compared with 411 now and only 374 when @entity25 took power in 1997			1
@entity27 controls : the figures - based on data from the @entity18 and @entity11 statistical agencies - show the huge impact of @entity22 's open - door immigration policy the revelations will fuel the debate over immigration , especially with the @entity18 opening its borders to @entity34 and @entity35 workers on @entity36			1
@entity37 , the @entity38 mp who obtained the figures , said : ‘ under the last @entity22 government , @entity0 ’s green and pleasant land became @entity0 ’s green and crowded land			1
number of people expected to be living per square kilometre in 2015 - by country ‘ for reasons which have never been properly explained , @entity22 instigated a policy of massive expansion of immigration			1
the fear must be a future @entity22 government would do the same ’			1
sir @entity53 , chairman of the @entity55 think - tank , said 90 per cent of immigrants to the @entity18 headed to @entity0			1
‘ the rapidly growing population density is an inevitable consequence of @entity22 ’s mass immigration of nearly four million in 13 years , ’ he added			1
‘ we already see the pressure on maternity units and primary schools			0
less visible is the pressure on housing , which is already in crisis			0
‘ we will need to build 200 houses a day for the next 20 years or so simply for new immigrants and their families			2
’ the @entity16 report says the number of people living in every square kilometre in @entity0 will rise from 411 now to 419 in 2015 , to 433 in 2020 and to 460 in 2030			2
by 2046 , an astonishing 494 people will be living in each square kilometre			0
the equivalent figure for @entity6 will be just 115 , for @entity7 204 and the @entity8 421			2
by 2015 , @entity0 will also be more than three times more packed than @entity77 – where an estimated one million of the arrivals under @entity22 originated from			1
the research raises concerns about how the @entity18 ’s infrastructure can cope with the increased pressure on schools , hospitals and roads			2
clash : @entity87 business secretary @entity87 , left , likened @entity89 's policies to @entity90 ’s notorious 1960s ‘ rivers of blood ’ speech the large numbers packed into the country will also affect water and power supplies , and will increase pressure to build over green spaces			2
@entity89 , under pressure to confront the electoral threat posed by @entity102 , has changed the law to prevent @entity11 migrants claiming any benefits in the first three months following arrival			0
in the wake of the open door immigration policies deliberately pursued by @entity22 , @entity0 is now the most crowded country in @entity2			1
by 2015 , there will be twice as many people crammed into every square kilometre as in @entity7 , and four times more than in @entity6			0
only three decades from now , unless there is a significant tightening in border controls , there will be almost 495 people living in each square kilometre – compared to only 374 when @entity22 came to power in 1997			2
@entity87 and his colleagues on the @entity123 disgracefully suggest that it is somehow racist to worry about immigration			0
as our revelations show , it has nothing to do with race – and everything to do with how schools , social services , the @entity134 and housing can possibly be expected to cope with such unprecedented pressure			2
officials say they want to reduce the ‘ pull factor ’ to the @entity18			0
last weekend , tensions between the two @entity141 government parties boiled over when @entity87 business secretary @entity87 likened @entity38 policies to @entity90 ’s notorious 1960s ‘ rivers of blood ’ speech			0
the @entity146 has already warned that @entity18 must make room for almost 10million more people over the next 25 years – the equivalent of building a city even larger than @entity151			0
the increase , mainly a result of immigration and high migrant birthrates , will push numbers to 73.3million by 2037			0
a @entity158 spokesman said : ‘ immigration has brought benefits to the @entity18 and we welcome people who want to come here to contribute to our economy and society			0
‘ however , it is important to control immigration because of its effect on social cohesion , our public services , and on jobs and wages			0
’ the figures for the rest of the @entity18 in 2015 are predicted to be : @entity174 40 per square kilometre , @entity175 258 and @entity176 131			0
@entity9 ’s figure is expected to be 1,308 .			1

@entity0 has overtaken the @entity8 and is second only to tiny @entity9
over the next 30 years the gap is expected to widen even more
