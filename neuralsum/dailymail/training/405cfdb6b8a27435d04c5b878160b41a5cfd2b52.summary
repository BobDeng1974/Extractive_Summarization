by @entity1 reporter published : 17:10 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 17:14 est , 17 november 2013 an elk who headbutted a photographer in the @entity5 has been euthanized			1
video footage of the incredible incident showed photographer @entity8 sitting on the ground by the side of a road			1
he acted submissively by keeping his head down but the elk became increasingly agitated , knocking of his hat and repeatedly jabbing him around the head and neck with its antlers			2
it has now emerged that soon after the incident , the elk was put down by @entity20 because he ' could not be re-trained to be fearful of humans			1
i am deeply hurt by the loss of such a beautiful creature that in its own way bonded with me			0
i looked forward to watching him grow to a mature bull as the years passed			0
i ’m truly heartbroken to know he is gone , ' he wrote in a statement			0
at the time of the incident , mr @entity8 managed to remain calm , despite his predicament , and continued to act submissive , perhaps thinking the elk would lose interest and walk away			1
incredibly he even managed to take a few cheeky photographs of the animal as it hovered just inches away from his face			2
the elk continued to stand its ground becoming more and more aggressive			2
at one point it menacingly begins rubbing its hoof on the ground looking as if it is about to charge			0
according park spokeswoman @entity57 , the elk had been coming back to that area in search of food as a result of previous humans feeding him , and had begun associating humans with food			1
stick around : the elk hooks its antlers underneath the photographers shirt as it becomes increasingly aggressive @entity20 assured mr @entity8 that he did nothing wrong in the video			1
the elk had been exhibiting aggressive behavior for a long time , and this was apparently their only course of action			2
this is n’t something the park resorts to often and , in fact , this elk is the first the park has ever put down			1
mr @entity8 has said that he can no longer watch the video			1
' all the joy is gone			0
' he says he wished that the photos and video had n't gone viral and that the elk might still be alive as a result			2
aggressive : the photographer holds onto his hat as the elk continues to jab him with its antlers head butt : the powerful animal continued to lunge at the photographer , who was at risk of being seriously injured the video was been posted on @entity98 by @entity99 who later emailed the photographer to get his side of the story			1
at the time mr @entity8 shared his thoughts			1
' my first thoughts were ' wow , he 's getting pretty damn close here			2
' ' but i 've been up close before without incident			0
i hoped being still and passive would see him pass on			0
when he lowered his antlers to me , i wanted to keep my vitals protected and my head down			0
i felt that standing up would provoke him more and leave me more vulnerable to goring			0
' submissive : the photographer calmly walks away after the animal refused to back down nibble : the @entity116 tries to eat the photographer 's equipment i think that while protecting myself with my head down , having my head down was a signal that i was rutting with him			1
i was concerned at first , but when he started rearing back and lunging at me later on , i got scared and pi * * ed off			0
' so i guess at some point if the ranger had n't of pulled up , i would have had to disengage the best i could			0
i 've joked with my friends that at least he took me for a buck and not a cow ! '			0

photographer , @entity8 , repeatedly butted by the animal during rutting season
park rangers had to put the elk down because it was no longer scared of humans
mr @entity8 says he is ' *hearbroken* ' that the elk has been put down , the first in the park 's history
