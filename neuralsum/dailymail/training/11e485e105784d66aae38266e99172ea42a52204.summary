are you ready to experience the worst flight of your life ? @entity3 will show it to you			1
in an attempt to bore viewers as much as possible they 've released a six hour promotion video that 's less enjoyable - and longer - to watch than paint drying			1
the campaign aims to show travellers just how mind bendingly monotonous it can be to fly with one of those other ' blah ' airlines			1
@entity16 has a mock website at @entity18 where their tagline is ' you will get there ' seen through the eyes of a passenger ( stuck in an middle seat , of course ) you 're able to experience @entity26 on ' @entity16 ' in real time as it takes off from @entity28 and flies to @entity29			1
the journey time is five hours and 45 minutes and every excruciating second is played out by mannequins			0
listen to mundane conversations about a fellow passenger 's love of cheese and screeching air hostesses ; experience the eternal hell of a child in front incessantly bashing their chair ; watch a terrible film ; fall asleep and get woken up by someone listening to rock music and inhale a cloud of hairspray from the woman next to you - the list on annoyances is endless			1
real time : the flight 's journey time is 5 hr 45 mins and every second is excruciatingly boring like watching paint dry : listen to mundane conversations and chippy air hostesses from middle seat the film is available to watch online ( already more than 150,000 people have ) and on @entity3 's own in - flight entertainment system			1
the unusual ad was created by advertising company @entity64 and @entity16 even has its own fictitious website at www.blahairlines.com where list three types of seat are listed , ' @entity61 ' and the tagline is ' you will get there '			2
fake testimonials include ' i have flown @entity74 airlines			0
' by @entity76 from @entity77 and ' they got me to @entity78			0
i 'll give them that ' from @entity80 in @entity81			0
@entity3 and advertising company @entity64 are behind the unusual ad campaign an integrated approach : there 's even a social media channel for the airline called @ @entity87 there 's also a social media channel for the airline called @ @entity87 which is tweeting gems such as ' we are passionate about clear aisles ' and ' the best in - flight entertainment is a conversation with a fellow passenger '			2
they will reply , like a real airline , to your tweets			0
@entity101 told @entity102 , ' the passengers have no choice but to be on ' autopilot ' to get through the tedious journey			0
' just trying to watch the video is downright painful â€” and that 's the point			2
if you would n't sit through the entire film , why would you pay money to experience it in real life ? '			0
