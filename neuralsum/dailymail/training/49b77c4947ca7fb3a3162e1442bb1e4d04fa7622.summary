whether you 're standing in an airport security line or waiting at a crowded gate , it would be nice to take the load off your feet while travelling sometimes			2
now a company using @entity7 to fund its new invention hopes people will be able to do just that with a handy seat that 's so small it fits in a back pocket			1
the @entity14 is a compact seat made of a strong type of plastic often used for bullet - proof glass or @entity19 , which folds out into a seat on a stick			1
it folds into the size of your back pocket ( left ) the product - which would retail for $ 50 ( £ 30 ) - enables people to rest their legs and back by transferring their weight to the seat attached to one long pull out leg			1
@entity40 company @entity39 + @entity39 recently introduced the @entity14 , and the team behind its design has to date raised more than 812,000 kroner ( nearly £ 90,000 ) on @entity7 with three days to go in its campaign			1
creator @entity25 says the idea for the @entity14 came four years ago , when he was waiting for a band to come on stage and thought about how people are often left standing for long periods of time , leading to an aching back and legs			1
rest easy : the young team behind the @entity14 have managed to raise nearly £ 90,000 with three days to go the monopod comes in various different colours to suit all tastes ( left ) and even the packaging is cool ( right ) the designer calls the product a ' monopod ' and it is so small it literally fits in your pocket when folded up			1
' @entity61 been doing sports most of my life , and through the sports i 've accumulated various small injuries in my knees , back and so forth , ' @entity25 said			2
' all this waiting that you expect when you go to watch sports , go shopping with your girlfriends or travel			2
you wait for several hours at a time , which can be quite uncomfortable			2
' designed to fit in the back pocket , the @entity14 can travel pretty much everywhere in a pocket or bag folded up , the @entity14 is 6.6 inches tall and 2.6 inches in diameter			2
to extend it , the user pulls out both sides of the horizontal seat and pulls down on the monopod , or extending ' leg '			0
the @entity14 is height - adjustable and can extend to about 34 inches tall			0
the seat itself , when extended , is 13 inches in diameter and supports a weight of up to 20 stone			1
when sitting on the device , the user must keep their feet on the ground just like with a traditional shooting stick			0
balancing is therefore required but @entity25 insists this does n't take much effort and supports correct posture			0
so does the @entity14 mean an extension of our sedentary lifestyles ? ' it is better to stand up than sit down , ' @entity25 acknowledges			0
' but the thing is , how long is it better to stand up ? when you stand for a long time , it 's inevitable that your lower back will start aching			1
' your body is tired , and gravity does take its toll on everybody , so you need to sit down at some point			0
this kind of bridges the gap between sitting and standing all the time			0
' with the @entity14 , because you 're so high , you do n't sit with all of your weight on it			1
you move all the small muscles , and you can keep your energy levels higher [ than when sitting on a chair ] , especially when you wait three hours in the same spot			0
' the developers plan to have the product on sale by april 2015			2
what @entity127 says on @entity7 : ' for the first time ergonomic seating is truly portable , inconspicuous enough to use in public and exceptionally functional			1
' @entity14 lets you enjoy all the benefits of portable resting without being a burden to bring along			0
' imagine if you could pop out a foldable seat when your back and knees starts aching , watching your favorite sports or concert			0
imagine not having to carry a clumsy chair with you when going hunting , fishing or bird watching			0
' remember standing in 2 + hour passport lines after 8 hours of flight or waiting for delayed transportation			0
' now , imagine : having a seat in your pocket that will help you stay focused and active , keeping you in eyeheight with your standing friends , while being inconspicuous enough for nobody to notice ! ' people who want to contribute to the product 's manufacture can visit the @entity7 website for the next three days only .			1
