they may resemble magical - looking toadstools or alien structures , but these stunning images in fact capture the precise moment a droplet of water is shot with a pellet gun			1
as the droplet falls and splashes into a tray of water below , a pellet cuts through the artificially - coloured liquid and elegant shapes are created			1
to capture the moment , the photographer took many hundreds of images and then trawled through them all to select the most striking shots			2
@entity20 , 42 , from @entity21 , snapped the moment of impact by constructing a complicated set - up to take the photos			1
the businessman said : ' i build a rig with a computer control board that helps with the timing aspects			1
' he explained his process is ' all about timing			2
from the first drop there is about 70 milliseconds to the second and 40 milliseconds for the third			0
' i use water softener in the tray below to break the water tension			2
that makes your plume jump higher			0
' this [ also ] makes the water stronger [ so it does ] not break up as easily which gives you better shapes			0
when you start , you first have to get the initial impact			0
once the set - up is perfect , @entity50 said that he starts to shape his shots using timers			1
' it can take 100 to 200 shots to start			0
then you start taking proper images			0
probably 200 to 500 shots will yield five to 10 great images			0
' the moment of impact : @entity20 , 42 , from @entity21 , caught the moment of impact by constructing a complicated rig to take the photos a precise art : from the first drop of water there is about 70 milliseconds to the second and 40 milliseconds for the third , the businessman explained			1
he used water softener in the tray of water to break the water tension a little bit sci - fi : this shot may look like some of of force filed in a sci - fi film , but shows the shape when a drop of water bounces off water 's surface			2
some of the images show a pellet cutting through the artificially coloured liquid and others simply show the beauty of water droplets mr @entity20 explained it can take 100 to 200 shots to begin taking his best images			1
he said : ' then you start taking proper images			0
probably 200 to 500 shots will yield five to 10 great images			0
' pellets fired from a gun are visible in these two images deep impact : as the droplet splashes into the water ( pictred left and right ) a pellet cuts through the artificially coloured liquid , which has fabric softener added to it			1

pictures show water droplets splashing into a tray of liquid , while a pellet fired from a gun cuts through them
@entity20 , 42 , from @entity21 took hundreds of photos to capture the moments of impact
he used a computer and rig set - up to make sure he got the timing right - down to milliseconds
