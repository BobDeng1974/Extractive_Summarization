by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 06:41 est , 5 november 2013 guilty : @entity1 was sentenced in april for fraud after her windfall in 2011 a mother - of - three sparked outrage when it was revealed she continued to claim benefits after winning £ 95,000 on @entity8			1
@entity1 , 40 , from @entity9 , received the windfall after appearing on the tv game show in april 2011 and was eventually punished in april of this year when her case went to court			1
as previously reported in the @entity13 , she was sentenced to a 12 - month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered to repay more than £ 6,000 after admitting six counts of fraud			1
many felt the sentence was lenient given her crimes and that she should have gone to jail			0
but a new @entity23 documentary has revealed that she would n't have faced justice at all if it was n't for the efforts of investigators at @entity27			1
@entity28 , benefit fraud manager at the council said : ' it 's quite distressing when you think how many people are in difficult situations and here 's someone who has just walked away with a tax free lump sum of £ 95,000 and yet still feels it 's ok to keep claiming all the benefits she can			2
' despite her being seen on @entity8 pocketing the fortune , this was not enough to for the council to accuse her of fraud after she carried on claiming benefits			1
@entity47 , which airs on @entity23 on wednesday evening , shows how @entity48 was only able to be charged after evidence was built up against her following months of research and surveillance			2
@entity53 was the main investigator for the council in @entity48 's case			0
he had to stake out her house and her children 's school for weeks to track her movements			2
he also had to trawl her bank accounts and @entity66 page to find evidence of her deceit			1
he explains on the documentary what drove him to become a fraud investigator and why he was determined to bring @entity48 to justice			0
he said : ' i was bought up on an estate with a family of nine , none of us would ever dream of claiming benefits fraudulently			1
when you hear of people doing it , it does get to you			0
' he added : ' she 's been claiming benefits from people like myself that contribute to that system			1
when she won the money , it was the time to say thank you for your help , i do n't need that money anymore			2
' but instead , @entity48 did n't declare her winnings and carried on claiming income support , housing benefits , single person discount on council tax and free school meals for her children			1
thanks to her winnings and benefits , she drove a 4x4 , took a seven week holiday in @entity110 and started a business buying and renting properties in the country			0
cheat : the mother won £ 95,000 on @entity8 but continued to claim benefits - and would have gotten away with it if the council had n't investigated to catch her out , the council had to get written evidence from @entity119 , the tv company who makes @entity8 , that they had paid @entity48 £ 95,000			1
when this was confirmed , they then searched @entity48 's bank records and found she had divided the fortune between three different accounts she had opened in her own name			2
she was also earning undeclared money by doing shifts as a receptionist			0
as well as claiming she needed benefits in order to live and feed her children despite her game show winnings and earnings , the investigators were intrigued to see her with her ex-husband on the show			1
she was meant to have separated from @entity140 in 2008 but he played the dutiful husband during her @entity8 appearance			0
@entity1 on the game show with presenter @entity144 : she spent seven weeks on holiday in @entity110 with her winnings while taxpayers paid her income tax and rent mr @entity53 were alarmed to see them acting like a couple when @entity48 was claiming housing benefit as a single occupier in @entity27 and @entity140 was doing the same in @entity154			1
on her @entity66 page , he found further evidence the couple were still together			1
he found pictures of them on holiday and @entity140 still had his relationship status listed as ' married to @entity1			2
' mr @entity53 also uncovered that @entity140 had come from luxurious beginnings before coming to the @entity163 with his family as political refugees			0
his father had been president of @entity167 before @entity168 seized power and the family had lived well in a state house			0
the council eventually had enough evidence to confront @entity48 and interviewed her			2
she admitted she had funded her seven week holiday with her winnings from @entity8			0
built up a case : @entity28 , left , and @entity53 from @entity27 were determined to bring @entity48 to justice and their efforts are revealed in a new documentary when asked what she thought taxpayers would think about her winning thousands while still claiming benefits , she replied : ' they would n't be happy			1
' she was charged and appeared at @entity185 in april where she was sentenced to the unpaid work and ordered to replay £ 6,000			1
mr @entity53 said they were satisfied their efforts led to a conviction			0
' after an allegation of someone getting some money , we 've proved it and proved she 'd done stuff with the money and lived a lavish lifestyle for a time while the public were paying her rent and council tax , ' he said			0
her appearance attracted widespread media attention and the @entity23 footage shows her pushing over a photographer trying to snap her , telling him : ' it 's not fair what you 're doing			0
' as she leaves court after her sentence , @entity163 on the fiddle presenter , @entity214 , asks her why she did it and if she 's sorry			0
but she refuses to answer			0
@entity163 on the fiddle is on @entity23 on wednesday evening at 9pm			0

@entity1 received windfall after appearing on the game show
but she carried on claiming benefits
footage of her winning on tv show was n't enough evidence
@entity27 had to stake out her home
also searched her bank accounts and @entity66 page
eventually had enough proof to take her to court
she was sentenced to unpaid work and ordered to repay £ 6,000
she admitted taxpayers ' would n't have been happy ' about her *behaviour*
