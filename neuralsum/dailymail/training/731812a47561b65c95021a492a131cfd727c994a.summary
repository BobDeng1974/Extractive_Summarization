by @entity0 last updated at 2:35 pm on 20th october 2011 illegal immigrants in the @entity3 are being sent home in record numbers , with those who pose a public safety risk or national security threat being deported first , the homeland security secretary said last night			1

the government is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants , she said			1
homeland security secretary @entity9 defended the @entity12 administration 's new policy of deciding which illegal immigrants to remove first the new priority system is a shift from the @entity24 administration 's enforcement strategy , mrs @entity9 said in a speech at @entity26 in @entity27 @entity28 say making it a priority to deport those immigrants amounts to a back - door way of granting amnesty to other people who are living in the @entity3 illegally but have n't committed crimes			1
yet to immigration advocates , the administration is still deporting such illegal immigrants			1
mrs @entity9 said policies inherited from the @entity24 administration ' allowed as many resources , if not more , to be spent tracking down and deporting the college student as were spent on apprehending criminal aliens and gang members			1
' authorities would conduct large raids at companies without consistently punishing the employer or targeting individuals who posed a threat			2
' public safety was n't enhanced by these raids , and they sometimes required hundreds of agents and thousands of hours to complete , ' she said			0
now , she said , the @entity55 is using fingerprints collected from those held in local jails to identify and deport criminals and repeat immigration violators			0
on the move : @entity62 are the largest group of illegal immigrants in the @entity3 and numbered 6.5million , or 58 per cent of the total across the nation , in 2010 advocates for an immigration overhaul say this program , known as @entity70 , has resulted in the deportation of people accused of traffic violations or other similarly low - level offences			1
several states have said they do n't want to participate , arguing that immigration is a federal , not state , responsibility			0
mrs @entity9 denied that the program had led to more annual deportations and did n't give police immigration authority			1
for example , participation at first was thought to be voluntary , but department officials later made it mandatory			0
under fire : @entity28 have criticised the @entity12 administration 's overall approach to enforcement she said : ' but as flawed as the beginnings of this program were , it has already helped accomplish a great deal toward ensuring that we use our enforcement resources where they do the most good			0
' she also said the administration was committed to comprehensive immigration changes			0
congressional republicans have said the government must first secure the border before discussions can turn to an overhaul and have criticised the @entity12 administration 's overall approach to enforcement			2
neither side was satisfied with yesterday 's speech			0
@entity28 @entity110 of @entity111 , chairman of the @entity112 , said the administration 's immigration policies do n't make sense			0
' there is nothing smart about it - seven million illegal immigrants work in the @entity3 while 14million @entity3 are unemployed , ' he said in a statement			1
' work site enforcement activities are down 70 per cent			0
the @entity12 administration has abandoned work site enforcement , allowing illegal workers to take jobs that should go to @entity3 workers			2
' @entity126 , executive director of the pro-immigrant @entity127 , said the government needs to move faster in fulfilling promises to target criminals and others who pose a safety threat			2
he said : ' fast , sound implementation of the department 's deportation prioritisation is needed now			0
in this time of scarce dollars and budget crisis , our government should not waste billions on haphazard and unfocused enforcement			2
' @entity55 officials have been promoting the criminal targeting effort since @entity143 officials announced the arrests of nearly 3,000 criminal illegal immigrants in week - long , nationwide sweep last week			1
those people will now face deportation proceedings .			0
