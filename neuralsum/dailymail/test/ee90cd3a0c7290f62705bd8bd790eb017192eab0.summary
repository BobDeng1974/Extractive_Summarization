a period of striving came to an end for @entity2 and @entity3 at the @entity4 on saturday			1
the manager 's 15 - minute press conference , where he conceded that his team 's chances of qualifying for the @entity10 were over , was a requiem for lost opportunities			1
@entity3 did his best to stay upbeat			1
the @entity2 manager does not do disconsolate			1
but he did not pretend that this has not been a difficult season			2
after their heroic tilt at the title last year , @entity2 have slipped out of contention			1
it is a bitter pill to swallow for a club that had scented a return to glory			0
it still feels as if @entity2 are moving forward under @entity3			1
it still feels as if he has the confidence , the ability and the strategy to take them back to the top			2
but there is no disguising the fact that this is an uncomfortable , uncertain time for the manager and his players			0
@entity3 admitted @entity2 are unlikely to reach the top four after losing to @entity35 4 - 1 on saturday right back @entity36 gave @entity35 the lead as the @entity38 went on to win 4 - 1 at the @entity4 just four minutes later , @entity39 had doubled the lead for the home side with this brilliant free kick @entity43 got in on the goalscoring act just before half - time to give @entity35 an unassailable lead when they went on a run in which they lost only once in 17 league games from mid-november through to mid-march , it seemed like last season 's magic was coming back			1
but when that 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity56 was followed by a crushing 4 - 1 loss to @entity35 , the perspective changed			1
suddenly , the troubles are crowding in on @entity3			1
he spent much of his press conference answering questions about @entity62 's refusal to sign the new contract he has been offered			2
it also became clear there was a new controversy involving @entity67			0
when asked why @entity67 was not in the squad , @entity3 found it hard to disguise his frustration			1
' he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed it not able to travel with the team , ' @entity3 said			1
' he felt it was too sore to travel			0
the medical staff have looked at it but it was just something that he , himself , did not feel comfortable enough to travel with			0
' the problems with @entity67 , his failure to settle into @entity3 's system , are symbols of the difficulties the club has faced in a season dominated by trying to adapt to life after @entity87 and by the long , melancholy farewell to @entity89 , and it has not been easy			1
@entity2 missed the suspended @entity89			1
they missed @entity90 even more			0
at times , their defending was shambolic			0
@entity3 spent most of his press conference fielding questions about contract rebel @entity62 @entity67 was not included in the @entity2 squad to face @entity35 after picking up a slight knock @entity3 revealed that @entity67 withdrew himself from the squad and did not travel to @entity97 @entity98 is still feeling his way back from injury and he has not yet rediscovered his confidence			1
his injury problems added to the sense of loss brought by the transfer of @entity87 to @entity106			0
then there is the fact that several of their close - season buys , notably @entity111 , @entity67 and @entity112 , have not come close to fulfilling expectations			2
@entity115 has been a success , @entity114 has had a fine season and @entity118 has emerged as an outstanding midfielder but nevertheless , failure to make the top four will bring about new problems			2
@entity3 admitted that the lack of @entity10 football would make it harder for the club to hang on to their best players			1
wednesday 's @entity129 quarter - final replay against @entity130 had now become ' very , very important , ' @entity3 admitted			1
' the summer was very difficult with losing @entity87 , ' @entity3 said			2
' @entity98 [ @entity131 ] was injured from the beginning of the season and the whole integration of new players was an issue			2
it was like starting again			0
it was like my first six months			0
@entity98 , a second - half substitute at the @entity4 , has spent most of the season out injured it was difficult viewing for @entity2 manager @entity3 as his side imploded in the first half against @entity35 long - serving captain @entity89 will leave the cub at the end of the season and join @entity148 ' up to the defeat against @entity56 we were the form team and playing very , very well			1
we have been dealt two big blows in these last two games			2
i very much doubt we will be in the top four now			2
there is too much ground to make up			0
that is the realistic view from me			0
' now we must really focus on the @entity129 and that is going to be very , very important for us			0
there has been a lot of learning that has taken place this year			0
young players have improved as the season has gone on and hopefully now we can finish strongly			0
we need to go into next year and make a really bright start in the opening eight games			0
@entity89 , a club icon for nearly 20 years , will be playing in @entity168 by the time the new season begins			0
his departure will draw a line under an era at @entity173			0
saturday 's defeat means that @entity2 's new age will dawn with a team that , once again , has much to prove .			1

@entity2 were beaten 4 - 1 by @entity35 at the @entity4 on saturday
@entity180 's top four hopes have been dealt a *massive* blow with the defeat
@entity2 lost to another of their top - four rivals @entity56 before the *international* break
@entity3 admits that their chances of qualifying for next season 's @entity10 have severely *diminished*
