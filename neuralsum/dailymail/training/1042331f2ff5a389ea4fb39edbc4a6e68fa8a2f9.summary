@entity0 will not break the bank to re-sign @entity2 — because he turned them down a year ago to sign a new deal with @entity4			1
while @entity0 would love @entity2 back at @entity5 because of his talent and star appeal , a package of about £ 120million for a player who turns 30 in february is considered a step too far even for the richest club in the world			1
@entity0 are determined that any potential move next summer will be done on their terms and are prepared to play hardball with @entity4 , a club experiencing financial difficulties and expected to announce debts of nearly £ 400m at their annual general meeting on sunday			1
@entity0 will not break the bank to bring @entity4 star @entity2 back to the club @entity2 turned down @entity0 in favour of signing a new deal in @entity24 last summer @entity25 : ronaldo highlights likewise , there is little appetite to match @entity2 ’s wages in @entity4 of £ 300,000 a week after tax and upset their other top @entity0 stars @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
there is still irritation within the corridors of power at @entity0 that @entity2 flirted with a return last year but ultimately used the club ’s interest as a negotiating tool to sign a new five - year deal with @entity4 — a move that makes him far more expensive to secure this time around			1
@entity4 would want about £ 60m for @entity2 next summer because the player would still have three years left on his contract and he would demand to be @entity0 ’s highest - paid player with a four - year deal of about £ 300,000 a week			1
@entity2 enjoyed six successful years at @entity0 under legendary boss sir @entity48 @entity2 appears to be loving life in @entity4 in this photo ... but a @entity52 return has been mooted it would all add up to a £ 120m expenditure on a player who might not be the same force in his thirties as he has been over the past decade , despite remaining in stunning goalscoring form			2
on saturday he bagged the 27th hat - trick of his career as @entity4 romped to an 8 - 2 win at @entity62			0
in addition , the club have already embarked on a huge spending spree since being rejected by @entity2			0
the @entity66 have paid £ 215m in transfer fees over the past 13 months on new players and an additional £ 50m is earmarked to make @entity33 ’s move from @entity70 permanent next summer			2
their latest financial results in september reported an 84 per cent drop in profits to £ 23m			0
nobody at @entity5 will want to completely rule out @entity2 ’s return as it would help to cement their worldwide popularity but a deal will only become likely if @entity0 feel it can be done with either a greatly reduced transfer fee or wage demands			2
@entity0 may not have the financial capability to pull of deal if they sign @entity33 permanently next year that possibility does exist , though , with @entity4 ’s latest set of financial figures shedding light on why they sold @entity89 in the summer			2
the biggest concern for the club ’s president @entity91 is that , while the debt has shot up by 11.3 per cent from the previous year , income has only increased by five per cent in the same period			0
if the club ’s debt continues to rise they would have to forgo their special status as a sporting association in @entity24 and , as a consequence , lose certain tax perks that they share with three other clubs — @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
that special status is currently under investigation by the @entity109 as possible illegal state aid to clubs			0
