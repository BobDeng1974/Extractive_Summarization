by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 12:17 est , 26 june 2012 from a chapel pulpit on @entity2 , where every @entity6 airman reports for basic training , col. @entity3 delivered his first order to nearly 600 recruits seated in the pews : if you 're sexually harassed or assaulted , tell someone			0
' my job is to give you a safe , effective training environment , ' @entity3 said firmly			0
what the colonel did not mention directly in his recent address was a widening sex scandal that has rocked the base , one of the nation 's busiest military training centers			0
victims ? : female airmen march during graduation at @entity2 in @entity28 allegations that male instructors had sex with , and in one case raped , female trainees have led to criminal charges against four men			1
charges against others are possible			0
the most serious accusations surround an @entity40 staff sergeant scheduled to face a court - martial in july on charges that include rape and multiple counts of aggravated sexual assault			1
the other three defendants were charged with lesser crimes ranging from sexual misconduct to adultery			1
all of the defendants were assigned to turn raw recruits into airmen in eight weeks of basic training			0
a two - star general is now investigating alongside a separate criminal probe , which military prosecutors say could sweep up more airmen			2
advocates for female service members and members of @entity60 have started taking notice			0
' it 's a pretty big scandal the @entity40 is having to deal with at this point , ' said @entity64 , a former @entity65 infantry officer and policy director of the @entity67			0
' it 's pretty substantial in its scope			0
' col. @entity3 ( pictured ) advised recruits : if you 're sexually harassed or assaulted , tell someone but did not mention the scandal yet there are signs the @entity40 still does n't have a handle on the full depth of the problem			0
staff sgt. @entity80 pleaded guilty earlier this month to having sex with a female trainee and struck a plea deal for 90 days ' confinement			1
then he acknowledged being involved with a total of 10 trainees â€” a number previously unknown to investigators			2
on friday , after months of embarrassing disclosures , the head of the @entity40 's training command ordered maj. gen. @entity92 to lead an independent investigation			0
that same day , the @entity40 gave reporters rare access to @entity97 's instructional headquarters in an effort to show there was nothing to hide			1
the headquarters facility is where @entity97 trains the people who train recruits			1
inside one small classroom , three women and two men were lectured on the importance of having a moral compass while watching a slide presentation titled ' @entity111 '			0
@entity97 has about 475 instructors for the nearly 36,000 airmen who will graduate this year			1
that 's about 85 per cent of what @entity97 would consider a full roster of instructors , a demanding job that requires airmen to work longer hours than most for four years , at the expense of family and personal time			1
the @entity40 recently launched a smartphone app to help recruit instructors			2
topping a page of frequently asked questions is whether the divorce rate for instructors really is higher			2
( the @entity40 says no. ) @entity3 said that a slight shortage in instructors has not lowered the standards for applicants			2
in response to the allegations , he said instructor training is being revamped and that he was accountable for problems within the training wing			2
leaders of the instructor program , however , said the responsibility falls on the accused			2
' a person sitting in that seat , they 're going to do what they 're going to do when no one is watching , ' said master sgt. @entity147 , who oversees the training			2
' that 's across the board			0
when we 're outside this door or outside these walls , there are individuals that have their own personal values			0
' military personnel stand outside the @entity2 in @entity161 , one of the nation 's busiest military training centers , where four male instructors are charged with having sex with , and in one case raping , female trainees so widespread is the fallout that @entity97 halted operations for an entire day in march to survey about 5,900 trainees about whether they had seen or been a victim of sexual misconduct			1
it was a highly unusual move for a vast 15 - square - mile base that runs with relentless efficiency			2
a new class of airmen graduates every friday for 50 of the 52 weeks in the year			0
at first , @entity3 , commander of the 737th training wing , said he was n't sure that halting training was even possible			0
airman @entity181 , a new graduate who was in basic training at the height of the investigation at @entity97 , said she never felt uncomfortable with her instructors			1
' they want to make sure no foul play is happening , no one is taking advantage of us , ' said @entity181 , of @entity191 , @entity192			0
last week , one commander of a @entity97 training squadron caught up in the sex scandal was dismissed after the @entity40 lost confidence in his leadership			1
col. @entity198 , 2nd air force staff , said the dismissal was not directly related to the sexual misconduct investigation			1
the @entity67 supports and works with servicewomen nearly three dozen instructors at @entity97 have also been removed in the past year , but the @entity40 will not say how many lost their jobs as a result of the investigation that began last fall , only that the majority of dismissals were unrelated			1
the first sexual misconduct allegations at @entity97 surfaced a year ago against staff sgt. @entity211 , who is charged with 28 counts			1
@entity211 , the only instructor who has been accused of sexually assaulting another airman , faces life in prison if convicted			1
his civilian attorney , @entity216 , has declined to speak with reporters and did not return multiple calls for comment			0
sexual assault victims are reassigned and can apply for a ' humanitarian discharge ' from the military , but @entity97 civilian spokeswoman @entity223 said she did not know whether those affected by this case had done so .			1
