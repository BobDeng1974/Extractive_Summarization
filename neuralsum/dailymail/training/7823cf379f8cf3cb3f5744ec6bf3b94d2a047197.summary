silent : there was little sign of life at the @entity3 embassy in @entity4 's @entity7 today a large container was reversed into the @entity3 embassy in west @entity4 , leading speculation that the ambassador is being pulled out of the @entity21 police held traffic so the container could be moved into position at the embassy in @entity7 but the man , who refused to give his name , would not explain why possessions were being removed from the building or say whether ambassador @entity38 was relocating			1
he said : ' i wo n't say anything about this			2
we have said everything we are going to say to the @entity44			0
' the country 's regime has a reputation for extreme secrecy , such as censoring its citizens and allowing only a small number of visitors through its borders , who are closely monitored during their stay			1
speculation that the country 's ambassador was preparing to leave the @entity21 was prompted earlier this week when a sign appeared on a tree outside the property warning that ' loading ' would take place on tuesday			1
an individual at the property previously said that a secretary was leaving the @entity21 having come to the end of his term and that a replacement secretary would arrive shortly afterwards			1
the seven - bedroom property , which has been @entity3 's embassy since 2003 , is often a focal point for demonstrations against the oppressive regime			1
built in the 1920s in a residential suburb , it is a far cry from the more luxurious ambassadorial properties of other nations in central @entity4			1
boxes were seen being brought out of the house into the waiting lorry , that had been reversed up to the door to try to shield the action from waiting cameras the move came on the day that @entity3 sent more shivers through the international community by warning foreigners living in @entity14 to flee because the region was on the verge of nuclear war			1
' the situation on the @entity92 is inching close to a thermonuclear war … @entity3 does not want to see foreigners in @entity14 fall victim to the war , ' the government mouthpiece , @entity96 news agency , said			0
' all foreign institutions and enterprises and foreigners , including tourists , are requested to take measures for shelter and evacuation in advance for their safety			0

the new threat appeared to be an attempt to scare foreigners into pressing their governments to get @entity133 and @entity134 to act to avert a conflict			0
analysts see a direct attack on @entity134 as extremely unlikely and there are no overt signs that @entity3 's 1.2 million - strong army is preparing for war – let alone a nuclear one			0

the @entity15 , which has also been threatened by @entity181 , says there are no imminent signs of threats to @entity15 citizens			0
