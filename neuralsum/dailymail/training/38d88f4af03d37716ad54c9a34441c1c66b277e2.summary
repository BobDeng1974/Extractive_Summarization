' earlier this fall , skier @entity164 was one of the few @entity30 athletes to speak out against the @entity12 law , calling it ' absolutely embarrassing ' .			0

@entity0 , who won a gold medal in 1988 , had never publicly addressed his *sexuality* before his announcement last month
it comes in response to the *oppressive* anti-gay laws in @entity12
he will be *joining* tennis legend @entity116 and hockey player @entity137 on the presidential delegation , both of whom are also gay
