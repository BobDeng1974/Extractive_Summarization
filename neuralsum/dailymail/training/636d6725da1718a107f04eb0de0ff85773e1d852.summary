by @entity0 a young woman who suffered from anorexia for more than six years has beaten the eating disorder thanks to @entity4			1
@entity5 , 22 , suffered three heart attacks while suffering from anorexia and bulimia , a battle which started at the age of 15 and saw her weight drop to just six stone by the time she was 20			1
ms @entity5 , who says she developed an eating disorder to cope with bullying at school and the death of her grandmother , was told by doctors she only had months to live unless she changed her habits			1
back to health : @entity5 , 22 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , has been able to make a full recovery from her anorexia thanks to @entity4 at her lowest point , ms @entity5 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , was finally admitted to hospital in november 2012 after suffering three suspected heart attacks on being discharged , she discovered pilates and just a few months later had become a healthy size 8			1
ms @entity5 now wants to start teaching pilates and is studying for a diploma in to become and instructor			1
‘ when the bullies used to tell me i was fat and ugly , i started to believe them , ’ ms @entity5 says			1
‘ i broke down my own self confidence from then on by being negative about myself , but what started as cutting calories spiralled out of control			2
‘ during treatment i was n’t allowed to exercise , it was seen as a negative because a lot of the patients would use it as a way to lose weight			2
long way back : @entity5 suffered three heart attacks while battling anorexia , a fight which saw her weight drop to just six stone , pictured left during her illness and right , back to a healthy weight ‘ when i was released from day treatment i felt really uncomfortable in my body , i was exhausted , depressed and had lost all my strength			1
i wanted to find something new to try and i had heard about @entity4			1
‘ i started doing about two classes a week and i soon found not only was i good at it , but i loved it , too			2
‘ i finally found my drive and ambition again which is something i thought i had lost			2
' i was rebuilding my body and it felt amazing			2
it made me happy which was something i had n’t felt in ages			2
’ at just 15 , ms @entity5 at first found it easy to hide her eating disorder from her family			1
she lived with her mother who was training to be a midwife and working irregular shifts , making it easy for her to skip meals			2
where it began : @entity5 , pictured with a friend while she was ill , began controlling her calorie intake after she was bullied about her weight in school low point : @entity5 at her thinnest			1
' when the bullies used to tell me i was fat and ugly , i started to believe them , ’ she says ‘ but then i realised that i could eat but that i could get rid of it straight away which is when i developed bulimia			1
‘ i was 20 when i was finally diagnosed , but there was n’t enough help			2
the waiting list for the clinic in @entity23 was about a year			1
nothing really happened until i collapsed at university			2
’ ms @entity5 was referred for day treatment but instead of making her better , it just made her worse			1
she said : ‘ everyone there is so thin and it made me feel like i was n’t good enough			0
my body could n’t deal with it and even when i tried to keep food down i was regurgitating it every five minutes			0
’ the constant throwing up had done some serious damage to her body			0
a healthy person has potassium levels between 3.5 and five , but hers had fallen to just two , which put her at serious risk of heart attacks or even organ failure			1
healthy weight : more than six years after she first fell is , @entity5 is now fully recovered from her eating disorder , according to doctors , but says she sees it as an ongoing process then in november 2012 , she collapsed with a suspected heart attack			1
she said ; ‘ my whole body cramped up			0
i could n’t breathe and just curled up in a ball			0
‘ i had another two attacks , the first by the side of the road and another one in the consultant ’s office			1
‘ he just took me into a room and said " this is getting ridiculous now "			0
he told me i would be dead in a month - that i would n’t make it until the end of the year			1
‘ i was admitted to @entity134 the same day			0
’ onwards and upwards : @entity5 is now studying to become a @entity4 instructor ms @entity5 spent two weeks in hospital where she had to eat three meals a day and drink high calorie , nutritional drinks			1
she was only allowed access to a bathroom at certain times , and even then she was supervised			0
she said : ‘ it was incredibly difficult , but when you reach that point you get a sense of unison with the other people there			2
' you ca n’t not eat the meal because you ’ll be letting the others down			0
‘ i came out after a couple of weeks			0
the purpose was n’t to feed me back up again ; it was to condition me into not being sick all the time			0
‘ i went back into day treatment but again it did n’t help			0
’ but shortly after leaving day treatment , while undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy , ms @entity5 discovered @entity4			1
this is a system of exercises designed to improve strength , flexibility , and posture , and enhance mental awareness			0
it gave her a new lease of life and for the first time in a long she decided to actively try and get better			0
she said : ‘ finding something that made me happy gave me something to focus on			0
‘ as well as being a @entity4 instructor , i want to go into schools and talk about healthy body image - there is too much focus on weight			1
‘ i will never see myself as recovered			0
you are never fully recovered from something like this			0
it ’s an ongoing process			0
recovery is n’t an easy road ; it is full of bumps and setbacks			0
‘ but now i have the tools to cope and the opportunity to try to be as happy as possible , make the most of life and learn to love in the skin that i am in			0
