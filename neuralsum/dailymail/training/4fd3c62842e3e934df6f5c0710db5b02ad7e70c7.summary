divers say they have found a ship off the coast of @entity3 which they believe is about 2,000 years old			1
the ship , which was spotted in the sea off the town on @entity9 in the province of @entity11 , is thought to be a @entity13 - era commercial vessel			1
the pots are so well preserved food still remains inside them			1
the ship , a navis oneraria , or merchant vessel , was located at a depth of about 200 feet after a remotely operated vehicle ( @entity27 ) was used to scour the seabed			1
a search for the shipwreck was launched after local fisherman revealed they kept finding pieces of pottery in their nets			0
the divers found the wreck so well preserved even the food , still sealed in over 200 pots , is intact			1
' the peculiarity of this is that the wreck could be almost intact , ' lt col @entity40 of the police divers ' group told the @entity46			1
' we believe it dates to sometime between the @entity49 and the @entity50			0
' the ship was found to be carrying over 200 pots containing food			1
initial tests have found pickled fish , which was often used to create a sauce called garum			1
@entity57 was a popular staple of menus for wealthly @entity60 , made from fermented fish and served as a side dish to meals			2
it was created by placing fatty fish such as sardines along with fish guts and blood into a large container with herbs and layers of salt			2
the container was then left in the sun for several days , before being mixed ever day for around 20 days , until it became a liquid			2
other foodstuffs found in the pots include wine , oil and grain			1
the team has so far been unable to find the name of the ship , but it was believed to be a sailed vessel used to carry commercial goods			2
the ship would have been travelling between @entity3 and @entity86 , a popular shipping route , and would have been carrying food to sell at its destination			0

the containers found in the wreck are known as amphora , and are a unique shape , often containing handles			0
the large containers were commonly used to transport large quantities of food and wine , and were able to hold both solid and liquid			0

@entity3 police bring ashore a pot recovered from the 2,000 year old wreck			0
they have now banned other divers from visiting it to protect the site			0
' there are some broken jars around the wreck , but we believe that most of the amphorae inside the ship are still sealed and food filled , " said lt. col. @entity40			2
it is hoped that further tests on the foodstuffs could give an insight into @entity13 lifestyles			1
the ship is thought to have travelled on trade routes between @entity86 and what is now central @entity3 and was loaded with more than 200 clay amphorae likely to have contained fish , wine , oil and grain			1

here , a robotic hand is seen reaching out for a pot. the ship , which dates to sometime between the @entity49 and the @entity155 , is hidden under layers of mud on the seabed , which has left the wreck and its cargo intact			1
the vessel will remain hidden at the bottom of the sea until @entity3 authorities decide whether to raise it or not , and police have placed an exclusion zone around it to protect it from other divers			0
