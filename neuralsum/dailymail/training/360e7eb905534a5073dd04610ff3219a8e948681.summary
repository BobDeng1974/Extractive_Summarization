by @entity0 published : 23:36 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 23:36 est , 26 march 2012 after 76 days , @entity1 - isolated and incommunicado for nearly 50 of those after his canoe capsized - has become the first person to paddle across the @entity6 from @entity7 to the @entity8			1
mr @entity1 , who began his adventure in @entity10 , @entity11 , on december 21 , and stopped for several days in the @entity12 for rest and supplies , reached the island of @entity16 on sunday , he told @entity0 in a phone interview from the @entity8 nation			1
when his 24.61 feet canoe capsized at sea , the @entity20 adventurer said he managed to save it but his communications equipment was damaged and he had not been in contact with his family since february 6			1
record - breaker : @entity1 has become the first person to paddle across the @entity6 from @entity7 to the @entity8 mr @entity1 , 30 , made the journey without a satellite tracking system which would have allowed him to signal that he was all right			1
so his wife , who stayed behind in @entity20 , could only hope for the best			0
' the supplier raised the price at the last minute and i decided to leave without one because it was not possible to postpone the trip , ' mr @entity1 said from @entity35 in southern @entity16			1
' this trip was the first time i did n't have a tracking system and the first time i really would have needed one			0
' during the nearly seven weeks he was out of reach , @entity41 , his wife , gave no indications that she was anything but totally sure that her husband was alive and that only equipment failure was to blame for their lack of communication			0
solitude : @entity1 said that he often thought about what his loved ones were going through , and was heartened by the faith and confidence of his family in his abilities during the long silence she kept posting entries on their web page nearly every day , speculating about @entity1 's position and how the weather conditions were affecting his voyage on the canoe nicknamed ' @entity66 , ' which means ' valiant ' in @entity20			1
mr @entity1 said that in his solitude he often thought about what his loved ones were likely going through , and was heartened by the faith and confidence of his family in his abilities during the long silence			2
' i was positively surprised in those at home ... because everyone was certain that if i run into any difficulties , i 'll be able to solve them , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' it was a great relief to reach port because it meant completing the journey and because my family could finally know for sure that i was ok			0
' while he lit smoke flares on three separate occasions to signal ships passing nearby , he was not able to communicate with any of them			0
status unknown : @entity1 made the journey without a satellite tracking system which would have allowed him to signal that he was all right ' some slowed and even changed direction as they likely picked me up on their radars , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' but i was often surrounded by waves 12 feet high and the canoe is less than one meter high , so it 's most likely that they simply were n't able to see me			0
' the uniqueness of mr @entity1 's crossing was confirmed by the @entity99 - based @entity98 , which adjudicates such feats for the @entity101			2
@entity6 crossings have been made in rowboats and kayaks , but not a canoe , in which a paddle with a single blade is used			2
' we were disappointed he had no satellite tracking on board , ' said @entity112 , editor - in - chief of the society 's website			0
' we are very pleased to hear that he has arrived '			0
in 2008 , mr @entity1 and his wife successfully rowed across the @entity6 together , but this solo challenge had been in the works for a long time and he reached his destination some 20 days faster than planned			1
' i was very interested in discovering what it 's like to be all alone on a ship in the ocean , ' @entity1 said			2
' it was my childhood dream			0

@entity1 made most of the journey without communications equipment , which was damaged when his canoe capsized
finished his voyage 20 days faster than *expected*
