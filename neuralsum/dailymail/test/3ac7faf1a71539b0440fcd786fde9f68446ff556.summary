@entity0 dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country 's top earners @entity7 and @entity8 politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the chancellor 's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the government 's priorities			1
@entity0 has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country 's top earners , offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than £ 50,000 could see the rate lowered			1
instead he says the @entity24 are committed to raising the tax - free personal allowance bracket from £ 10,000 to £ 12,500			1
raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least £ 50,000 was also a priority , he said			1
at present anyone earning between £ 31,866 to £ 150,000 is taxed at the higher rate			1
those earning above £ 150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent			1
but @entity7 politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket			1
accusing the current government of prioritising ' helping the very richest ' , @entity37 chief secretary @entity36 condemned the chancellor 's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries			1
when pressed in an interview with @entity45 the chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for @entity48 's top earners , instead saying the issue was ' not a priority '			1
' if that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities			0
judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax - free personal allowance to £ 12,500 so people full - time on the minimum wage do n't have to pay income tax and millions are better off , ' he said			1
' and when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate , the 40p rate , to £ 50,000			2
' ' those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament			0
' the chancellor added that any deal between @entity7 and @entity82 would harm the country , claiming the latter 's leader , @entity84 , was ' much stronger ' than the opposition leader he also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence , the limit agreed by @entity91 members			2
@entity92 has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence ' we made a commitment at @entity91			2
we are spending it today			0
we have made a clear commitment to the future of the equipment budget , to increase that in real terms			0
and we have made commitments on the size of the armed forces , ' he said			0
' i do n't think anyone should be in any doubt ... about our commitment to strong national security '			0
he also said any deal struck between the @entity82 and @entity7 would harm the country , lambasting first minister @entity84 's attempts to broker such a partnership as ' disturbing '			2
' the fact that the @entity7 , that was a party that campaigned for the @entity115 in the referendum , is contemplating an arrangement with the @entity82 , who want to break up the country , is deeply disturbing			2
' he added the @entity122 nationalist leaders were ' much stronger ' than the opposition leader who he said would be overrun if they entered a coalition together			0
' that would be bad for the entire @entity48 , bad for the integrity of the @entity115 but also bad for our economy because it would mean higher debts and higher taxes			0
' he also accused @entity134 of ' running scared ' by not agreeing to a debate with him and @entity136 , the @entity136 chief secretary to the treasury			0
the chancellor accused @entity134 of ' running scared ' of a debate on the economy with himself and @entity136			0

chancellor faces calls to rule out further tax cuts for the @entity48 's top earners

instead he *focused* on raising the amount of tax - free income to £ 12,500
@entity7 plans to *impose* 50 per cent tax rate on salaries of £ 150,000 or more
the current rate for the top tax bracket is 45p with basic *standing* at *20p*
