@entity1 manager @entity0 believes striker @entity2 can now put his injury problems behind him and will be back in prime condition when the @entity5 resumes after the international break			1
the @entity7 international has been plagued by hamstring and pelvic injuries since joining from @entity11 for £ 32million but that has not stopped him scoring 10 goals already , including the winner in the 2 - 1 victory against @entity16 on saturday			1
@entity2 has been left out of the national squad for a @entity19 qualifier against @entity20 next week and a friendly against @entity22 three days later			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 is delighted striker @entity2 is being rested by the @entity7 national team @entity2 scored the winner in @entity1 's 2 - 1 win over @entity16 at @entity27 in the @entity5 on saturday @entity2 has been troubled with a hamstring problem all season , but @entity0 feels the rest will be a big help by the time the league campaign resumes at home to @entity34 on november 22 , @entity0 expects his star man to be firing on all cylinders			1
' i think @entity7 made a fantastic decision not just for us but for them , ' he said			0
' he has 15 days to get to the top of his game and when they need him they will get a good @entity2 not a bad one			1
' maybe the injury was good because it stopped him			0
when he became injured he had time to recover , step - by - step , and at this moment he is in a good condition			0
' @entity0 also hopes the international break will give midfielders @entity49 and @entity50 time to recover from hamstring and abductor problems respectively after risking them at @entity27			1
' i need to give credit to them - they both played injured , risked everything to play , ' he added			0
@entity0 said @entity50 ( left ) and @entity49 ( right ) both played against @entity16 with injuries ' @entity49 gambled and i gambled			1
he can join up with @entity7 but he will be back ( as he is not fit )			0
' unbeaten @entity1 maintained their four - point lead at the top of the table with a ninth win in 11 matches and stretched a remarkable 15 points ahead of @entity16 , runners - up last season			1
the @entity69 were not realistically expected to contend this campaign but even without them in the running , @entity0 knows there is plenty to be done before his team can even entertain thoughts of the title			2
' if this was the @entity79 , @entity80 or @entity81 league where you have two teams competing to be champion , if you leave one team 15 points behind you are almost there but this is @entity88 and every match is difficult , ' he added			0
' it is not about @entity16 , there is @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95			2
' we are in a good situation , we have already played the four matches in @entity16 and @entity99 , four very difficult matches away , but it is the beginning of november so there is a long way to go			2
' @entity104 ( above ) put @entity16 1 - 0 up against @entity1 with his first goal for the club in the ninth minute @entity107 ( above ) equalised five minutes later with a goal that needed confirming through goal - line technology if @entity1 have a long way to go , @entity16 's task is even more onerous as a fifth defeat of the season - and third in a week after reverses at @entity116 and @entity117 - leaves manager @entity118 with some difficult questions to ask himself and his players			1
the decision to rest key players in @entity11 , making seven changes , did not pay off in terms of a result against @entity1			0
' obviously there is pressure on when you do n't get the result but i can only refocus now and it is important we get back to winning ways after the international break , ' said the @entity69 boss			0
' it is a difficult moment for us as we 're not getting the results and it has been a tough week really			0
' our focus is getting into that top four with the considerable change we have and we still have a big possibility to do that			0
' @entity118 looks on as his @entity16 team lose for the third time in their last three games with little goal threat to trouble the leaders , the return of striker @entity146 , who has not been seen in a red shirt since august 31 because of thigh and calf injuries , can not come soon enough			1
he is expected to be ready for the trip to @entity154 on november 23			0
' the break comes at a good time for us			0
we are hoping to get one or two injuries back after that and then we have to look to get on a run , ' added @entity118			2
' it has been a long time now ( without @entity146 )			2
we are hoping he can now get to work because he has n't trained with the team at all in the time off			0
@entity146 missed saturday 's game through injury and @entity118 hopes his return will improve @entity16 ' hopefully over the course of the next couple of weeks he can be out there training and we will have him back , which will be important as he has had a big impact for us			1
' @entity104 's first goal for the club since his £ 10million summer move from @entity175 gave @entity16 the ideal start - with the aid of a huge deflection off @entity107 but the @entity1 defender got himself back in credit by bundling the ball over at a corner for the equaliser , which required the assistance of the goal decision system			1
@entity2 displayed his clinical best with a sweet first - time strike to drill home @entity192 's cross , although @entity16 had a fair shout for a penalty ignored late on when the ball appeared to strike @entity107 's arm .			1

striker @entity2 has been hampered by a hamstring issue this season
@entity0 hopes the 15 - day break he has will allow him to overcome it
@entity118 feels @entity146 's return is essential for @entity16
