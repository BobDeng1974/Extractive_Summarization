@entity2 's @entity1 will have a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire , it has been claimed			1
a @entity6 videomaker claims to have acquired one of the screens - and has subjected it to a barrage of abuse , from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it			1
in the video , the screen emerges totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from @entity2			1
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			2
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity2 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity43 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity44 and to protects the phone 's camera			1
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity49 currently used in most high - end smartphones			0
@entity51 , a popular @entity6 host claims to have got the screen from well known @entity2 leaker @entity53 , who recently made his own video showcasing the screen			1
in the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen			1
' i slowly realized there is absolutely no way i can break this display under my own power , ' he said			0
' the worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much			0
' the glass is also extremely high - quality , @entity51 noted : ' there ’s absolutely no color shift while looking through the sapphire glass			0
' it is claimed the screen is made from sapphire crystal			0
@entity2 already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the ' home ' button and camera lens in the @entity44 , but the rest of the current @entity22 front display is made of @entity49			1
the new glass display is ' paper thin , ' @entity51 said in his video			0
@entity51 shows his screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally , keeping with rumors that @entity2 will release two different - sized iphones this year : a 4.7 - inch model and 5.5 - inch one			1
reports @entity2 was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year , yet sources claimed at the time @entity2 found the technology ‘ infeasible			2
’ in the video , @entity51 stands on the thin screen and bends it			2
when released , it goes back it its normal shape , raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen the screen is also shown being repeatedly stabbed by a knife - and emerging with no scratches , although it has not been confirmed to be the ' official ' screen that will feature in the new handset this was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens			1
however , @entity2 recently announced plans to open a mineral plant in @entity111 with sapphire glass experts @entity112			2
the facility is expected to employ around 700 people to manufacture sapphire crystal and sapphire glass , and this technology could make its way onto the screens of the next @entity22			2
the screen is described as ' paper thin '			0
it is claimed to be made from thin man - made layers of sapphire , which enables the material to be flexible , giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass in the video , the screen survived having keys scratched across its surface - a common problem for @entity22 owners who keep their handsets in their pocket in a statement about the announcement , @entity112 said : ‘ although the agreement does not guarantee volumes , it does require @entity145 to maintain a minimum level of capacity			1
’ while an @entity2 spokesman added : ' we are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in @entity111 , creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering , manufacturing and construction			2
‘ this new plant will make components for @entity2 products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from day one , as a result of the work we are doing with @entity163 to create green energy sources to power the facility			2
’ earlier this week @entity22 maker @entity165 revealed @entity2 's new @entity1 could be the first to be made using its ' robot army '			1
the firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and ceo @entity170 has revealed the robots , dubbed ' @entity172 ' , are in the final stages of testing			0
it is believed @entity165 will install 10,000 robots as a test			0
workers are seen inside a @entity165 factory in the township of @entity181 in the southern @entity183 province			0
the firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build @entity2 's latest iphone lines dedicated to @entity2 devices getting first priority , according to @entity190			1
it says @entity170 told a shareholder meeting that @entity2 would be the first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that its next product - the @entity22 6 - will be manufactured in this way			1
each $ 25,000 @entity196 can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year it has been claimed			0
@entity165 , which currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across @entity201			0
however , the firm 's robot initiative has been delayed since it was first announced in 2011			0
a leaked image , posted on @entity205 by @entity206 in june , shows the difference in size between the current @entity44 ( left ) and the ' @entity209 ' ( left ) at the time , @entity170 said the company had about 10,000 units already in operation , a number that was supposed to rise to 300,000 in 2012 , then one million by 2014			0
however , the firm is also ramping up human workers for the @entity22 6 , with 100,00 being hired according to some reports			1
prolific @entity2 - tipster , @entity53 , has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible @entity2 lcd backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches ( 14cm )			1
the photos suggest @entity2 is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5 - inch phone dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show @entity2 's @entity22			1
they all show a thin , curved device with distinctive white ' bars ' across the back			0
however , a @entity232 news agency has claimed that in fact , the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen .			2

video shows the *4.7inch* screen being bent , twisted , scratched with keys and even stabbed with a knife
screen emerges totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from @entity2 .
@entity22 6 believed to come in 4.7in screen and 5.5in screen *versions*
