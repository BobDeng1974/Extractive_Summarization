the @entity2 has spoken in the past about how they were upset over the leak of information about a foiled @entity61 plot where the terrorist group planned to detonate a bomb on a plane bound for the @entity65			2
' i 've been a prosecutor since 1976 and i have to say that this is among , if not the most serious , it is within the top two or three most serious leaks i 've ever seen , ' @entity0 said			0
government - backed : @entity0 said that the records they obtained were pertaining to the search for a security leak that led to the creation of an @entity18 story about a foiled terror plot questionable : @entity0 reportedly recused himself from the decision and allowed his deputy to make the call ' it put the @entity65 people at risk			1
it put the @entity65 people at risk			0
' that is n't enough to satisfy critics , as top republicans are already calling for @entity0 's resignation over the incident			0
' because attorney general @entity0 has so egregiously violated the public trust , the president should ask for his immediate resignation , ' @entity94 chairman @entity93 said			1

' @entity140 is first for a reason , ' @entity138 , spokesman for @entity121 speaker @entity139 , told @entity142			0
' if the @entity144 is going after reporters ’ phone records , they better have a damned good explanation			0
' outraged : @entity18 president and chief executive officer @entity148 , pictured , said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation a spokesman for @entity154 house majority leader @entity154 said the move is representative of a broader ' pattern of intimidation			2
' ' whether it is secretly targeting patriotic @entity65 participating in the electoral progress or reporters exercising their first amendment rights , these new revelations suggest a pattern of intimidation by the @entity144 , ' @entity159 said			0
the @entity167 was equally critical			0
' obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power , ' said @entity173 , director of the @entity175 , @entity176 , and @entity177			0
' @entity178 is a pillar of our democracy , and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources			0
' @entity18 president and chief executive officer @entity148 said the government obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation			2
he demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies			0
' there can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of @entity18 and its reporters , ' @entity148 wrote in a letter of protest to @entity0			1
' these records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the @entity18 during a two - month period , provide a road map to @entity18 's newsgathering operations , and disclose information about @entity18 's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know			2
' the exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 journalists work in the offices whose phone records were targeted on a wide array of stories about government and other matters			2

' prosecutors have sought phone records from reporters before , but the seizure of records from such a wide array of @entity18 offices , including general @entity18 switchboards numbers and an office - wide shared fax line , is unusual and largely unprecedented			1
in the letter notifying the @entity18 received friday , the @entity2 offered no explanation for the seizure , according to @entity148 's letter and attorneys for the @entity18 the records were presumably obtained from phone companies earlier this year although the government letter did not explain that			1
