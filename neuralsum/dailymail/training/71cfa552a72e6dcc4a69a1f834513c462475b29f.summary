@entity18 ' the characters in these are always so innocent , fair and harmless , and so i set about to create this project of the @entity5 characters to look at how we see good and bad in the world			1

' when you put up a piece of art in the streets , you talk directly to the audience without that prepared shield			0
' most people laugh at the art , some get abuse sprawled on them , and some like to write about them			0
