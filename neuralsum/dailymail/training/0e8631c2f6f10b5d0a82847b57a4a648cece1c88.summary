@entity0 flew half way round the world to address @entity4 's leading conservative conference last night - but hardly anyone turned up to listen			1
the @entity7 leader flew to @entity8 to address the gathering of hardcore activists before catching a ‘ red eye ’ flight home overnight to get back in time for this afternoon 's @entity7 conference in @entity14			1
but mr @entity0 was handed the ' graveyard ' speaking slot at the end of the day and was forced to address an audience of just 250 in a convention centre with a capacity for over 5,000			1
@entity0 flew to @entity8 to address @entity4 's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen mr @entity0 delivered his speech to row after row of empty chairs just an hour after the hall had been packed for a speech by @entity28 , the darling of @entity31 conservatives			1
the @entity32 is an annual three - day mecca for @entity31 campaigners , anti-abortion opponents and gun rights activists			2
mr @entity0 warned the @entity38 gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the conservatives in the @entity42 if they continued to embrace the political centre			1
mr @entity0 slammed @entity45 over his failure to identify the infamous @entity49 executioner ' @entity47			1
' ' of course they should have told us his name , ' he said			0
' we should have heard it weeks ago			0
this information 's been known for a long time			2
' he also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday 's immigration figures			2
' by sheer coincidence , ' he said , @entity59 's name was published ' on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the @entity42			1
' ' we 're not the @entity31 ' : @entity0 , whose @entity7 is challenging both @entity65 and @entity66 , said his is a real political force , not just an influence group trying to reform a wayward party he also hit out against cage , the @entity42 ngo that often advocates on behalf of radicalized @entity72 and brands their detractors ' islamophobes			1
' ' yes , yes , yes ! ' @entity0 exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most @entity42			1
' it 's politcal correctness ! ' i mean , we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of @entity85 saying and shouting things that – if you and i did them , we 'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order			2
' ' we actually have a @entity92 culture , ' he added			0
' it 's actually in our @entity94 , so let 's stand up for it			2
' is that xenophobic ? @entity0 does n't think so			1
' the thing about us , ' he said of the @entity42 , ' is that we have been , of all the @entity101 countries , the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to @entity42			0
' while ' private observance ' of any religion ' is fine , ' he insisted , ' unless we live under one law we 're in trouble			0
' the @entity32 brings all manner of right - wingers to a hotel in @entity113 each year mr @entity0 said the @entity38 was ' going through the same crisis of identity as the @entity116 in @entity42 '			1
@entity7 , he boasted , was ' an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels			1
' but he said : ' we 're not the tea party			0
our job is not to influence one political party			0
we 're not an outlier from the @entity65			0
' and unlike the @entity31 phenomenon , which peels off disaffected @entity38 who believe their traditional party has moved too far left , he said , his group ' is not just retired half - colonels who 've always voted @entity32 and now they 're @entity7			1
we 're dragging them from across the spectrum			0
' mr @entity0 also attacked mr @entity134 - claiming he sees ' an @entity4 president who does n't have the courage ' to fight against @entity138 terror			2
mr @entity134 , he claimed , lacks the vision to see ' what has gone wrong , and why those three people were arrested on the streets of the @entity4 yesterday			0
' that was a reference to the trio of @entity146 men who were detained by the @entity147 after they began the process of traveling to @entity149 for training with the @entity49 terror army – with the intention of bringing death and destruction back to @entity4			2
' we must stand firm and defend our @entity92 culture , ' @entity0 said , earnign his first boisterous applause			2
' we must make it clear that we believe in common law and not @entity160 law			0
' he called radical @entity72 ' an enemy within ' both the @entity4 and the @entity42			0
@entity0 said ' the @entity38 is going through the same crisis of identity as the @entity116 in @entity42 ' ' if you discuss immigration , it means you 're a bad person , ' he complained to a thousand convention - goers – ' that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else ' @entity32 's lineup includes @entity28 , whose teleprompter played tricks on her last month in @entity176 , leaving her rambling for minutes the @entity32 conference draws conservatives from all over the @entity4 , but they share the same message like any political force testing its boundaries by casting a wide net , it would be recognizable to @entity4 conservatives who have had to contend with their own brand of bad publicity			1
@entity187 , a @entity38 @entity188 candidate , famously self - imploded after musing on whether abortions should be allowed in cases of ' legitimate rape			0
' @entity28 just last month lost track of her teleprompter during a key @entity176 speech and rambled aimlessly for what seemed like hours , causing some to wonder if she was intoxicated			0
an ocean away , @entity7 councillor @entity196 was kicked out this month after she was filmed saying she has ' a problem with people with negroid features			1
' and social media accounts belonging to @entity7 activist @entity202 were plastered recently with claims that his home town of @entity206 is a ' sh * thole ' and ' full of p * * * s. ' his @entity211 account called @entity214 ' the @entity213 ' and labeled @entity215 ' pick pocketing criminals			1
' @entity202 insisted that his account was hacked , but the damage was done			0
@entity0 threw up his hands and suggested that idiots will be idiots			2
' well , look , ' he told @entity221 , ' people like @entity196 are local councillors			0
they are very low - level people in @entity7			1
they 're not major players			0
' ' yes , we get people who say stupid things in @entity7			1
i do n't approve or condone any of it			0
