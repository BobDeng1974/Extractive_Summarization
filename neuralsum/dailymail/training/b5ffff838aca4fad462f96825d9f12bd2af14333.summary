@entity0 by @entity1 do you have too much stuff ? of course you do			1
everybody has , and many of us are about to pop out to the shops and buy some more			1
shopping has become what people do for fun when they ca n’t think of anything else to do			1
and what do you get for it ? a massive credit card bill , a pair of shoes that looked nicer in the shop and a horrible feeling at the back of your mind that there ’s got to be more to life than this			2
stuffocation by @entity1 and there is , says @entity1 , there really is ! @entity1 is n’t the first writer to tell us that retail therapy is no kind of therapy at all — @entity35 has done so memorably in @entity36 and other books			1
but something about this one feels particularly timely			2
maybe it ’s because it ’s january , the month of regret			2
or maybe the tide really is turning against the tyranny of having too much stuff			2
@entity1 , who calls himself a ‘ trend analyst ’ , begins with a description of one of those men who has successfully banished stuff from his life			1
you know the type : no paintings on the walls , no books on the shelves , no shelves to have books on			2
just a bed , a few clothes , a laptop and an insufferable smugness that makes you want to spike his mug of rooibos tea			2
but some people will always go too far in any direction			0
@entity1 believes that stuffocation afflicts us all to some extent			1
which of us does n’t have a drawer in a cupboard somewhere that is full of bits of string and old batteries and other bits of rubbish that ‘ might come in handy ’ ? when our cupboards can take no more , we ’ll hire storage space before we get rid of it			1
as @entity1 reports , ‘ the average @entity85 woman now buys 58 items of clothing each year			1
there are twice as many things in her wardrobe today as there were in her equivalent ’s wardrobe in 1980			0
there are 22 things in there she has never worn			0
’ ( it ’s even worse in @entity98 , where they buy a new item of clothing , on average , every four or five days ; they buy 279 million toasters a year , for heaven ’s sake			1
) instead of materialism , @entity1 believes we should favour what he calls ‘ experientialism ’ , by which he means doing things , having experiences , using our minds and bodies and souls , and not just watching the tv			1
who can disagree ? @entity117 is effectively his manifesto for a better , fuller life , based on ‘ the absolute imperative that happiness is more likely to come from the enjoyment of experiences rather than the accumulation of stuff ’			1
and he argues it well , if sometimes a little glibly , in the manner of someone who has written a lot of marketing documents			0

’ the very slight problem with ‘ experientialism ’ is that you still need money for it			1
the best things in life really are n’t free , and the wonderful holidays he seems to suggest we all take are n’t on the menu for most of us			2
i sense that he ’s mainly writing for an @entity98 readership ( most of the examples he gives are @entity98 , although @entity1 himself is n’t ) and for bored businessmen on planes			1
nor am i entirely convinced that materialism is quite as washed - up as he would like it to be			0
anyone who went to @entity158 in the week before @entity156 knows that the @entity85 are addicted to shopping , dangerously so in some cases			0
my son wanted a playstation 4 because all his friends were getting one , which immediately rendered his @entity166 obsolete and surplus to requirements			0
in other words , the manufacturers have him — and , therefore , me — exactly where they want us : within their grasp and being squeezed for every penny			0
so rather than forecasting , there ’s an element of wishful thinking to this book			0
but why not ? even if he does occasionally write like a dalek , i think @entity1 is fundamentally right			1
too many of us are working too hard in jobs we do n’t enjoy in order to earn money to buy things we do n’t need or want			1
there has to be a better way			0
and he is spot on about the clutter			0
indeed , it ’s quite hard to read his book without looking round your home wondering what you can get rid of			0
staring up at my own overloaded bookshelves , i realised it might be time for another visit to @entity199			0
i ’ll probably keep his book , though			0
might come in handy .			2

who does n’t have a drawer full of bits of string and other rubbish that ‘ might come in handy ’ ?
