it 's been branded as a ' suicidal mission ' that may not deliver on its promises			1
despite this , the controversial @entity5 project - which aims to send people to live on the red planet - has whittled down its shortlist of candidates from 200,000 to just 663			1
from this , a final crew of four will be eventually be selected for a ' one - way ticket ' to @entity15 scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven - month journey from @entity17			0
this number will be reduced to 24 in the final rounds			2

the time frame for this next stage depends how long it takes the team to sort through the 663 additional teams would join the settlement every two years , with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on @entity28			1
there , they will collect data , plant oxygen - producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation			0
the majority of the 663 applicants - the full list can be viewed here - come from the @entity48 , with @entity49 and @entity50 coming in second and third place			0
in spite of the risks , more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the @entity57 - based group called for volunteers to join the mission			1
in the next stage , which may involve ' rigorous , potentially televised competitions ' , the current shortlist will be reduced to 24			1
the time frame for this next stage depends how long it takes the team to sort through the 663 on the list			1
@entity66 , former commander of the @entity67 , recently said that the mission may not deliver on this promise			1
' there 's a great , i do n't know , self - defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up , ' he warned in spite of the risks , more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the @entity57 - based group called for volunteers to join the mission			1

the satellite is part of the wider @entity5 mission set to launch in january 2018 @entity66 , former commander of the @entity67 , recently told @entity84 , writing in @entity85 that the mission may not deliver on this promise			1
' there 's a great , i do n't know , self - defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up , ' @entity66 told @entity85			1
the @entity5 project plans to launch a supply mission to land on @entity28 as soon as october 2016			2
a ‘ settlement rover ’ will then land in 2018			0
the landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that @entity5 said will make the trips ‘ much safer than moon missions ’			2
the group said it aims to have a human settlement on @entity28 within a decade			0
journey time to @entity28 , which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit , would be around 200 days			0
' i fear that it 's going to be a little disillusioning for people , because it 's presented as if for sure it 's going to happen			1
' @entity113 , the production company behind @entity114 , said earlier this year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet			2
candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice			0
any chosen @entity28 settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million - mile ( 482 million km ) pioneering mission			0
@entity128 of the @entity129 at the @entity130 told the @entity131 that the largest risk is the huge amounts of radiation the volunteers will receive			0
echoing mr @entity66 's concerns , he said he doubts that the volunteers for this trip know enough science and technology to take the risk			1
the group had promised on its site that in 1,000 years , everyone on @entity17 will remember who the first humans on @entity28 were			0
a robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018 , followed by a scouting rover ( artist 's impression pictured ) in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022 a robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018 , followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022			0
the next round will include an interview with @entity5 committee members , and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another			2
the third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and could broadcast on television and online			0
but mr @entity66 claims @entity28 should not be a target for colonisation at this point , but targets much closer need to be considered			1
' we absolutely need to do it on the moon for a few generations , ' he told mr keep .			0

the @entity5 mission aims to establish a colony on the red planet
it now has a shortlist of 663 candidates from an *original* 200,000 entries
this will be reduced to 24 in next stages , with four chosen for first mission
the time frame for this next stage depends how long it takes the team to sort through the 663 volunteers
mr @entity66 , former commander of @entity67 , said that mission may not deliver
' i fear that it 's going to be a little disillusioning for people , because it 's presented as if for sure it 's going to happen , ' he told *medium*
