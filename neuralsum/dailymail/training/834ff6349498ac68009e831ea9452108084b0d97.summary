by @entity0 published : 13:08 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 13:11 est , 12 november 2013 @entity1 has been a regular source of ridicule since it launched last year after claims it sent users onto airport runways and is missing entire towns , yet it seems the tech firm may have the last laugh			1
figures from analytics firm @entity11 has found that while @entity15 has lost almost a third of its users in the past year , @entity1 ’s own mapping service has been slowly gaining in popularity			1
the rise is being attributed to the introduction of @entity21 , which uses @entity1 as the default navigator			0
before @entity1 ( blue line ) launched in september 2012 , @entity15 's own mapping service ( orange line ) was used by around 78 % of @entity27 and @entity29 owners in the @entity30 a year later , this figure has dropped to 43 % while @entity1 's share has slowly risen to more than half of @entity27 users up until last year @entity1 ’s built - in mapping tools were powered by @entity15			1
during his keynote speech at the @entity37 in june last year , ex-senior vice president of @entity41 software @entity39 announced @entity1 would be switching to its own version of maps			2
the application was then officially released alongside the @entity27 in september 2012 , yet was heavily criticised for being inaccurate			0
@entity1 briefly kicked the @entity15 application off its store in 2009 because @entity15 would n’t add turn - by - turn navigation tools to its @entity27 app – despite the feature being available on the @entity29 version			1
it was later allowed back on the store , yet this is thought to have been the reason why @entity1 began developing its own app. the research was carried out by @entity57 ’s @entity56			0
he compared @entity11 figures from september 2012 – the month @entity1 launched – to the same app usage figures from september this year			1
last year , there were a total 103.6 million @entity27 and @entity29 owners and 81.1 million of them used @entity15			1
during the same month in 2013 , the number of phone owners has grown to 136.7 million , yet only 58.7 million of these people still use @entity15 ’s mapping service			1
this is a drop of almost 36 per cent in 12 months			0
during september this year , figures from @entity11 also showed that 60.1 million people in the @entity30 had an @entity27 , and of that number , 35 million had used @entity1 at least once			1
@entity1 is only available on @entity69 running the @entity21 software and above			0
based on @entity11 's figures , 58 per cent of the possible people who can use @entity1 , do			2
alternatively , @entity15 is available on iphones and @entity29 phones , so the numbers are higher but the proportion of users is less			2
the @entity57 also worked out that of the 58.7 million @entity15 users in september this year , 6 million used the app on an @entity27			1
@entity1 , pictured left , is only available on @entity69 running @entity21 and above , and 58 per cent of people who can use @entity1 , do			0
alternatively , @entity15 , right , is available on iphones and @entity29 phones , so the numbers are higher but the proportion of users is less overall of this 6 million , around 2 million physically could n’t use @entity1 because they were n’t running @entity21 6 - ultimately leaving @entity15 as one of the only options			2
up until last year @entity1 ’s built - in mapping tools were powered by @entity15			1
during his keynote speech at the @entity37 in june 2012 , ex-senior vice president of @entity41 software @entity39 announced @entity1 would be switching to its own version of maps			2
following the launch of @entity1 in september 2012 users complained the app sent them onto airport runways , pictured , and even into the sea the application was then officially released alongside the @entity27 in september but was heavily criticised for being inaccurate			2
users have complained the app has sent them onto airport runways , onto piers and even into the sea			0
@entity1 briefly kicked the @entity15 application off its store in 2009 because @entity15 would n’t add turn - by - turn navigation tools to its @entity27 app – despite the feature being available on the @entity29 version			1
it was later allowed back on the store , yet this is thought to have been the reason why @entity1 began developing its own app. @entity15 and @entity1 use location - based services , including @entity1 , to learn more about their customers			0
reports last week claimed @entity15 is planning to use location data about its customers to track them on the high street			0
each time a user enters a store of business , @entity15 would be able check their location and then see if that user looked at adverts for that company online beforehand			0
it would do this to check advert conversion rates			0
@entity15 also serves adverts on its @entity1 app meaning if fewer people are using it , fewer people will see their ads. recent reports found @entity15 makes around $ 100 million a day by selling @entity137 to businesses online .			0

the number of people using @entity15 has *fallen* by a third in a year
before @entity1 launched in 2012 , there were 81.1m @entity15 users
a year later , figures from @entity11 show this has dropped to 58.7m
this is despite the number of @entity27 and @entity29 users rising by *30m*
more than half of @entity41 users now use @entity1 's own mapping service
