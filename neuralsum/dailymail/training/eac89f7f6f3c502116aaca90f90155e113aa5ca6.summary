by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 1:11 pm on 1st february 2012 after the cull of judges and presenters from the @entity6 , it 's hardly surprising that @entity7 wants a world - class diva sitting on that panel this year			1
but even he might have set his sights somewhat high after it was reported that the music mogul is after @entity13			2
@entity7 is believed to be trying to convince the singer to be one of the judges on the second series of the show after she was unable to take part last year having just given birth to her twins			1
in high demand : @entity7 , seen here arriving at the @entity25 's @entity24 auditions in @entity26 last week , has set his sights on @entity13 to join the new judging panel on the next series of @entity6 a source told @entity30 : ' @entity7 wants nothing but the best for the @entity6 - and @entity13 is the best			1
' but her husband @entity33 is believed to not be very keen on the idea and indicated that she will turn down the role			2
he is reported as saying : ' why would my wife want to be on a show like that ? for somebody who has a legendary career , i do n't know why they would			1
' yesterday it was revealed that @entity45 and host @entity46 have been unceremoniously dumped from the @entity6 after just one season			1
could these two be coming on board ? @entity7 is believed to want @entity49 and @entity50 on the panel too reports today have suggested that @entity50 and @entity49 are also in @entity7 's sights to join @entity13 on the panel for the new series - and @entity55 , who presents the @entity58 version , has an outside chance of taking over from @entity46			1
@entity7 also recently admitted that despite axing her from the show last may , he would take @entity62 back on board			1
he said : ' i regret what happened because @entity62 was a close friend			2
i 've always believed we 'll end up doing something together again			0
' humble pie : @entity7 said he regretted sacking @entity62 from last year 's show and she would be very welcome to come back this year ' she could be a panellist again if she wanted to - 100 per cent			1
i do n't know if she would			0
i think she probably misses me			0
' his former darling @entity70 confirmed yesterday she had also been fired from the panel in a desperate shake - up by the mogul and the show 's producers			1
' yes , it ’s true ; i wo n’t be returning to @entity6 next season , ' @entity78 said in a statement today			0
' i ’ve learned through my longevity in this industry that business decisions often times override personal considerations			0
could @entity85 be vying for a role stateside ? the @entity6 @entity88 judge arrived in @entity89 yesterday as it was announced @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity70 had been axed she continued : ' @entity7 is , and will remain a dear friend of mine and i ’ve treasured my experience working this past season			1
i want nothing more than for @entity6 to exceed all of their wildest dreams			0
this truly has been a blessing and i am most grateful			0
' @entity7 , who first worked with @entity78 on @entity98 , wants to re-boot the show after its ratings fell short of expectations when it was launched last year			1
the decision to dismiss @entity78 has surprised many , given how hard @entity7 worked to secure her on the panel			0
' i want to say a massive thank you to @entity70 , @entity45 and @entity46 for being part of @entity6 last year			1
' we had a lot of fun making the show together and importantly , we found some real talent and stars			2
' you do develop friendships with the people you work with and @entity70 , in particular , is a very close friend and i expect to be working with her on another project in the near future			0
' i 'm sure all three are going to have massive success in what they do next , but now is the time to thank them all for everything they did last year			0
' it took several months for her contract to negotiated and she only closed her deal hours before the first televised audition			0
' you just have to get that chemistry , and she ’s right , ' he said at the time			0
' i ’ve never found anyone better than her			0
' both @entity78 and @entity45 were embroiled in the controversy surrounding the shock elimination of 13 - year - old frontrunner @entity136			0

' and he said in a statement today : ' i want to say a massive thank you to @entity70 , @entity45 and @entity46 for being part of @entity6 last year			1
i 'm sure all three are going to have massive success in what they do next , but now is the time to thank them all for everything they did last year			0
' although the @entity6 performed solidly in the ratings , hovering around the 12 million mark , it did not attract the same kind of huge viewing figures regularly attained by @entity7 's former show @entity98			2
@entity7 had also recently admitted that that he may have been overconfident when it came to the @entity161 version of his hit show , after ratings did not reach his 20 million prediction			2
he said he became ‘ a bit too cocky ' last year and admitted the slumping viewing figures had ' put my ego in check '			0
record executive @entity89 , who has previously worked with @entity13 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , survived the cut			1
' cleaning house ' : @entity45 ( left ) , @entity70 ( centre ) and @entity46 ( right ) have all been axed from the @entity6 , leaving only @entity7 and @entity89 on the panel			1
