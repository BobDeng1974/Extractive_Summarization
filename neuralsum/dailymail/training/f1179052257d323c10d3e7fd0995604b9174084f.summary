@entity0 was last night ruled out of @entity3 ’s @entity2 opener in @entity4 with a thigh injury			1
@entity0 pulled up during the morning training session at @entity7 on friday , reported discomfort in a thigh muscle and was whisked away for a scan			1
@entity3 ’s medics assessed the results and decided the 25 - year - old @entity14 striker was not fit to travel to @entity15 on sunday for the game on monday			1
the loss of @entity0 is without doubt the biggest blow			1
he has five goals in 16 appearances for his country and has become @entity25 ’s established centre - forward since hitting prolific form following his move to @entity44 from @entity45			1
he would have retained his place up front against the @entity47 but his absence provides the manager with the choice of making a simple straight swap , calling in @entity52 to partner captain @entity53 in a 4 - 4 - 2 system , or making a slight reshuffle to move @entity56 into a more central position			2
@entity56 started on the left wing against @entity59 on wednesday but finished the game in the centre , where he plays for @entity14			1
he could play there in support of @entity53 with @entity52 asked to play wide on the left			2
@entity65 also missed training on friday			1
@entity65 has a swollen ankle after aggravating a knock against @entity59 on wednesday and worked alone in the gym , but he is confident of being fit for monday			1
' i should be fine , ' said the @entity45 centre - half			2
' i ’ve got a bit of fluid on my ankle which they thought would be better rested			2
' goal threat : @entity25 will miss the quality the @entity14 man brings up top @entity65 missed out on another example of @entity25 ’s new angry persona , as the @entity3 manager yelled at his players for failing to produce the tempo and intensity he wanted to see in a crossing and shooting drill			1
it followed his x-rated reaction to questions in the post-match press briefings his team had only managed two shots on target during wednesday ’s 1 - 0 win against @entity59 in a friendly at @entity98			2
' i ’ve seen that side of him before , ' said @entity65			1
' when he is upset he expresses his opinion and gets angry			0
he is also good at calming situations			0
i ’ve seen a bit of both			0
' everyone wants it to be better			0
we ’re no different and the manager is no different			0
that ’s what you ’re seeing - adding more pressure for us to do better			0
it ’s easy to tick along when you ’re winning games			0
' gutted : @entity0 reacts to the news of his injury via social networking site @entity119 at 28 and with 28 caps , @entity65 is one of the senior squad members since @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 retired , and is ready to be one of the team ’s leaders			1
' i realise i ’m one of the more experienced or older lads , ' he said			0
' but , what is leadership ? is it shouting at everyone every two minutes or is it trying to be in the right position , trying to lead by example ? ' i think it ’s a mixture of both			0
saying sometimes what needs to be said but at the same time when you ’re on the field just trying to organise people , which does n’t necessarily have to mean throwing your arms everywhere			1
' the young lads in this group will become more vocal			0
you have to be vocal when you ’re playing			0
' we are physical and that was a big strength in the past of @entity153 teams			0
we need to have that as a young group moving forward			2
we need to have that nasty side to us as well			0

the @entity14 forward injured his thigh during a training session on friday
@entity0 could miss @entity14 's next three league *fixtures* against @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 as a result
it what come as a blow to @entity25 ahead of their first @entity171 2016 qualifying game against @entity4 on monday night
@entity65 should *recover* in time but @entity25 has already lost @entity27 and @entity28 for the game
