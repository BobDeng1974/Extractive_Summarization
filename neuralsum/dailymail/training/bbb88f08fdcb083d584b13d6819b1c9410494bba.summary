it is a story of faith , courage and determination in the face of immense pressure			0
when @entity8 and @entity9 found they were expecting quintuplets , the medical authorities in @entity7 said they must abort some of them to ensure the survival of the rest			1
but they refused , deciding instead to place their trust in the expertise of the @entity17 in @entity18			1
it was a gamble that paid off in spectacular style – and a story that captured @entity23 hearts			1

it ’s very special to us all			0
’ every detail of their delivery by caesarean on november 10 , 2007 had to be planned with precision , with a team of 18 doctors and nurses on standby to provide the finest care available			1
the babies were whisked into intensive care , and the day after their birth they were separated because so much specialist equipment was needed to care for them			2
two were taken to @entity84 ’s @entity83 ’s hospital and then @entity85 in @entity86 , while three remained at @entity17			2
the girls , pictured with some of the many staff at @entity17 who cared for them defied odds : @entity38 doctors told the parents to abort some of their babies to save the rest , but they refused hospital tour : the girls are shown an incubator at the @entity17 in @entity18 where they were born in 2007 staff at @entity17 were delighted to see the girls again			1

’ the @entity112 touched @entity23 with their story , which they shared with @entity114 after the girls ’ birth			1

their trip and treatment were funded by a generous local businessman			0
live births of such a large number of babies are extremely rare and the risks to the mother are high			0
in the majority of cases , they either miscarry or the babies are born too prematurely to survive			0
but the quintuplets were delivered safely , despite being 14 weeks early and ranging in weight from just 1lb 13oz to 2lb 2oz			0
each baby had one doctor and two nurses assigned to her , and within days they were all breathing by themselves			0

‘ they ’re very close , although they do clash sometimes , like all siblings			0
they dress alike because they get jealous if one ’s wearing something different			0
‘ they all have their own distinct personalities , and we ’re encouraging them to be their own people			0
@entity34 and @entity32 both love reading , and @entity9 , who ’s the tallest , is the most serious , while @entity47 is always smiling			2
’ @entity8 added : ‘ @entity33 is the leader , although they ’d all like to be			2
‘ there ’s no quiet one			0
’ the couple saved up for their trip back to @entity23 because they were desperate for the girls to return to the place of their birth			1
