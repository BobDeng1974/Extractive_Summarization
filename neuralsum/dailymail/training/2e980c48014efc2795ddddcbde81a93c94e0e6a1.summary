mr @entity0 wanted to claim disability benefits based on the injury to his left leg - but the @entity4 thought he wanted to claim for an earlier injury to his right foot a man who had his leg amputated was falsely accused of fiddling disability benefit after officials read a file about the other , healthy limb			1
@entity0 was hauled before a court by benefits officials who told him he was not disabled enough to claim the allowance even though his leg was due to be amputated			1
the mix up occurred because the 63 - year - old former trucker , whose left leg was shattered in a boyhood shotgun accident , also suffered a serious toe injury in his right foot			1
he was prosecuted when officials found a letter in his medical file showing he had made a full recovery from that operation and accused him of lying about his condition			2
he is angry that he has been treated as a criminal , despite battling to overcome his disability and work for 47 years , often in excruciating pain			0
@entity0 , of @entity32 , @entity33 , spent months waiting for his case to be heard at @entity35 before it was thrown out in less than five minutes			1
he denied falsely claiming disability living allowance and judge @entity37 , @entity38 , recorded not guilty verdicts after miss @entity40 offered no evidence on behalf of the @entity4			2
the case was dropped after defence solicitor @entity43 obtained a statement from @entity46 consultant @entity45 , confirming that mr @entity0 had always suffered from a disability which entitled him to benefit			1
after the case mr @entity0 explained that the case arose from a simple misunderstanding			1
his claim for disability benefits was based on the long standing injury to his left leg , which had eventually led to the amputation			1
the @entity4 prosecuted him on the basis that he had claimed benefits in relation to the injury to his right foot , which had been treated successfully and healed			1
he said : ' this whole business has been a nightmare			0
i have been taken to court and accused of swinging the lead when the truth was the opposite			2
the @entity4 prosecuted him on the basis that he had claimed benefits in relation to the injury to his right foot , which had been treated successfully and healed ' i suffered a very serious injury to my left leg in a shotgun accident when i was 12			1
at one stage it was touch and go whether i would survive			0
' i never used it as an excuse not to work			0
i started in the old @entity79 factory in @entity32 when i was 15 and then drove dumpers and tippers on building sites until i passed my hgv and became a lorry driver			0
' i did that for 40 years until i suffered arthritis in my right foot which led eventually to me having an operation to fuse my toe			0
' it was while i was in hospital i met someone from the @entity93 who told me i was entitled to disability allowance even though i was planning to go back to work			0
' after i was called in for interview and told i would be prosecuted my wife took photos of my left leg and sent them to the @entity4 but it made no difference			0
' at the same time as this case was going through the system i was in a lot of pain from the left leg and went back to hospital where mr @entity45 told me i had degenerative bone disease and would need an amputation			2
' it took months to persuade them that i am disabled but in the end they only restored my benefit after my left leg was amputated above the knee			2
' the consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity46 who wrote to @entity35 about @entity0 said the prosecution was ' barking mad '			1
mr @entity0 's claim for disability benefits was based on the long standing injury to his left leg , which had eventually led to the amputation the consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity46 who amputated mr @entity0 's leg said the prosecution was ' barking mad ' @entity45 , who amputated the mr @entity0 's lower left leg earlier this year , wrote a letter about his medical history to his solicitor			1
in it he said : ' @entity0 suffered a devastating injury to his left leg at the age of 12 and was lucky not to lose his leg			1
' when i first me i was amazed to hear that he 'd held a job down as a tipper driver for many years up until the age of 63 , with plans to continue working until retirement age of 65			0
' it was quite clear to me that he was a highly stoical individual who had minimised very significant orthopaedic problems in his left leg			0
' ... clearly i do n't have details of the prosecution case against @entity0 but i can say without any shadow of doubt that this man coped with a very severe left leg injury from the age of 12 to 63 , holding down a physicaly demanding job and , in my view , tolerating a great deal of pain and incapacity in the process			1
' however , as someone who generally takes a relatively robust attitude to some patients ' desires to claim benefits , i find the fact that @entity0 is being pursued completely bizarre to the point of being barking mad			1
' this , in my opinion , is a highly genuine man with an extremely significant orthopaedic problem who is actually an example of somebody who 's got on with their life and held down a job under extremely difficult circumstances			0
' a @entity4 spokeswoman said : ' we can not comment on individual cases			0
' in this case the defendant 's health deteriorated as the case was being progressed			2
' in light of his deteriorating health it was not in the public interest for this case to continue			0
' she said she could not comment on the consultant 's remarks and said it was a @entity187 ( @entity187 ) decision to review the case in court and offer no evidence			2
she added : ' our fraud investigators present the best evidence possible , however , ultimately it 's for the @entity187 to decide whether a prosecution goes ahead for benefit fraud			0
' if an overpayment is suspected then we will seek to recover that as a civil matter			0
