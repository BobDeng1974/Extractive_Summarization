reprisal : the two former soldiers were apparently trying to avenge the terrorism death of @entity7 explosion : a judge criticised the pair for wrongly targeting ' law - abiding @entity21 ' ' whatever your feelings of outrage were , you should have allowed justice to take its course , ' he said			1
' instead you carried out a retaliatory act of throwing petrol bombs at the @entity67			0
' as is usual in these cases , the victims had nothing to do with the events that so enraged you			0
they were entirely innocent law - abiding muslims who were practising their religion in a peaceable way			1
' the court heard how @entity8 and @entity10 launched two petrol bombs each at the mosque in @entity67 on may 26 - four days after @entity78 was murdered			1
they were spotted by police community support officers and followed back to @entity8 's nearby house where they were arrested			2
detectives found they had inadvertently filmed themselves bringing petrol into the house , building the bombs and leaving with them on a cctv systems at @entity8 ' home			2
caught in the act : the pair were filmed making the petrol bombs at @entity8 ' house @entity93 - handed : harness apparently did not realise that he had left his own @entity27 camera rolling heading off : harness and @entity10 were then seen carrying their home - made petrol bombs to the scene of the crime accomplice : @entity103 was jailed for three years for helping the pair carry out the attack the @entity27 footage , excerpts of which were played to @entity18 , showed the whole process of making the bombs until they left in @entity103 's car			1
@entity112 , prosecuting , said the bombs exploded outside the main doors of the mosque			0

the judge heard how both @entity8 and @entity10 served in the @entity128 with unblemished records			1
mr @entity112 told the court how @entity8 had been in the @entity128 for 13 years and experienced ' active warfare ' during deployments in @entity133 and @entity134			2

@entity140 , defending @entity10 , said his client had also served in the @entity128 with distinction , most notably as a close protection officer for senior officers			2
he added that the defendant was not a racist , and had previously worked in @entity147 teaching @entity148 to local @entity21 children			2
@entity150 , for @entity8 , said her client apologied for his ' foolish , absurd and reckless behaviour ' and said he was ' ashamed and disgusted ' by what he had done			2
return : the camera also showed the moment when the attackers returned to the home afterwards blast : the explosion was so large it could even be seen by a camera in a nearby car park fury : the crime took place just four days after the killing of @entity7 in @entity135 @entity103 drove the other two men to the mosque but did not throw any of the bombs , the judge heard			1
the judge said the offences were all religiously aggravated			0
speaking after the case concluded , a spokesman for the @entity67 said : ' our faith teaches us that in order to be perfect @entity21 , we have to be model citizens of the area in which we live			0
' it is with that aspiration that we want to move forward now and leave the events of may 26 behind			0
' det sgt @entity182 , from the @entity183 in @entity67 , said : ' we welcome the sentences handed to the three men			0
' this was a very serious offence that could have resulted in people inside the mosque being fatally injured , thankfully nobody was inside at the time and only minimal damage was caused to the building			0
' these three men took it upon themselves to react to incidents happening elsewhere in the country and retaliated by targeting the @entity197			0

@entity8 , 34 , and @entity10 , 37 , *pleaded* guilty to arson
