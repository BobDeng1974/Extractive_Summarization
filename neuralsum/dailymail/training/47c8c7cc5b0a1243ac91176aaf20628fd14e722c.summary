ask @entity0 how many children she has and she 'll say : ' three			1
' in fact her youngest , @entity3 , tragically died just a few months ago			1
but as @entity0 explains : ' i 'll always have three children			1
and i am still @entity3 's mother			1
' her darling boy was just four - and - a - half when he passed away last october			1
the speed with which he became ill left @entity0 , 29 , husband @entity10 and their two older children reeling			1
@entity3 had loved playing football and rough and tumble with @entity14 , 12 , and @entity15 , seven			1
' one moment he was running around with his brothers , ' recalls @entity0 , a stay - at - home mum from @entity17 , @entity18			1
' the next , i was organising his funeral			0
it happened so fast , i still do n't think i have come to terms with it			0
' i just thought it must be growing pains - i 'd heard lots of mums say their children 's legs ached sometimes , ' says @entity0			1
' some days he had no pain at all , others he would complain that it hurt a lot , sometimes in the lower part			0
as the term progressed , i thought , maybe he just was n't keen to go to school			2
' in fact , the medical consensus is that growing limbs do not normally cause pain			0
as dr @entity48 , a consultant in paediatric oncology at @entity50 says categorically : ' growing pains do not exist			1
' some children between the ages of three and 12 may suffer from pains in the legs at night , adds dr @entity55 , a consultant paediatric oncologist at @entity56			2
' but there is no evidence this is due to growth itself and in some cases may just be the aches and pains after physical activity that anyone would have			0
it may be that some children are more aware of pains than others			0
' sometimes @entity70 may use the term ' growing pains ' if they 're unsure of the cause of child 's pain , but ' if a problem persists or is getting worse , the cause should be reconsidered , ' says dr @entity55 , who is a spokesman for the @entity79			1
for instance , ' growing pains ' may be a sign of an underlying condition such as childhood arthritis			1
@entity3 ( centre ) pictured with mother @entity0 , father @entity10 and siblings @entity14 and @entity15 pain around the upper part of the shin ( tibia ) in rapidly growing , active children may also be linked to @entity93 disease , a painful condition that causes inflammation of the tendon that attaches the knee cap to the shin - this is not serious and usually clears up over time			1
dr @entity48 warns that if a child has pains in the legs and other symptoms such as persistent limping , pain or bruising , parents should not assume it is just ' growing pains ' - ' they should always get their child seen by a doctor '			1
as @entity0 is now all too keenly aware , in rare cases ' growing pains ' can be a sign of something serious			1
a month after @entity3 started complaining of achy legs he lost his appetite and developed bruises on his shins that varied in size from that of a 5p coin to a 50p piece			1
' i thought perhaps he was being kicked at school , so i went to his teacher , ' says @entity0			1
' but she said nothing like that was happening and @entity3 was happy at school			2
' by now it was october , six weeks after he had first complained of achy legs and @entity0 decided to take him to the gp			1
he complained of ' achy legs ' and @entity0 thought it must be growing pains he examined @entity133 and ordered blood and urine tests at the hospital			1
the next day the hospital called to ask @entity0 and @entity10 to bring @entity3 in straight away as his white blood cell count was unusually high			1
' my stomach lurched , ' says @entity0			2
' that afternoon @entity0 and @entity10 , 38 , hurried back to hospital with @entity3			1
doctors told them the heartbreaking news that @entity3 might have leukaemia			2
he was immediately transferred to @entity145 for scans			0
afterwards , @entity0 and @entity10 were led to a quiet room			2
' i saw the consultant 's face and i knew then there was something much worse going on , ' @entity0 says			2
' before , when we 'd talked of leukaemia , although it was terrifying , everyone seemed so hopeful and mentioned that the success rate if treated early was high , but now the tone changed			0
' i remember hearing her speak and then watching as @entity10 just collapsed into his seat			0
' the consultant said @entity3 had an aggressive children 's cancer called neuroblastoma			1
there was only a 30 per cent chance of survival			0
@entity3 was at stage four - an advanced stage - of the disease			1
neuroblastoma is a cancer of specialised nerve cells called neural crest cells that are particularly concentrated in the adrenal glands above the kidney and on either side of the vertebrae in the spine			2
@entity3 's tumour had begun on his right kidney			2
@entity0 says : ' we were told the doctors would still fight it with chemotherapy , but the odds were stacked against us			2
i had n't even taken it in			0
how had " growing pains " in my healthy boy been hiding this ? ' there are about 100 cases of neuroblastoma diagnosed a year in @entity193			1
' it 's very much a children 's disease , ' says dr @entity48			0
' ninety per cent of patients are under five years old , but very occasionally it can develop in an older child , a teenager or an adult			0
' the symptoms can vary from child to child , but early warning signs of the disease include a protruding abdomen , unexplained weight loss and limping or pain in one or both legs			0
even now , @entity0 constantly casts her mind back - trying to remember signs she may have overlooked			1
' but just days earlier @entity3 had been playing his computer games or running after his brothers			2
' after his diagnosis @entity3 remained in hospital			2
two weeks after he was admitted , he was sedated for an mibg scan - a nuclear scan which involves an injection of radioactive liquid - which looks for abnormal cell growth in the body			2
' a consultant took me aside , ' says @entity0			2
' i only had to look at his face to know			0
he confirmed @entity3 's organs were failing			2
' the scans showed his liver was riddled with tumours and in the hours that followed @entity3 's heart stopped twice			2
oncologists tried @entity3 with his first round of chemotherapy - desperate to try anything even at this stage			1
but it did n't work			0
@entity3 ( right ) with his brothers @entity14 and @entity15 ' they brought him back each time his heart stopped , but then a doctor told me this would simply keep on happening			2
i knew what he was saying			0
@entity3 's poor little body had been through so much			0
we had to make the hardest decision of our lives			0
' he had been put onto life support , but even this was n't working			0
@entity0 and @entity10 decided to let him go			0
later that day , @entity3 passed away in his mother 's arms			1
it was only 14 days after he 'd first seen the gp			0
' i walked around in a numb haze , unable to accept it , ' says @entity0			0
' i went through every stage of grief - disbelief , anger and back to disbelief again			0
' the family banned anyone from wearing black to the funeral and , instead of having flowers , they released balloons into the sky			0
now , although still in the depths of her grief , @entity0 wants to raise awareness of the signs of children 's cancer among other parents			1
' the trouble with the symptoms , is that so many of them can be explained away , ' she says			0
' the aching legs i thought were growing pains , the bruised shins could have been from rough and tumble			1
i had no idea these symptoms meant he had the most aggressive form of cancer			0
i look back every day at pictures and ask myself : did he have it then ? i 'll never know			0
' in the months after her son 's death , she found some comfort after visiting @entity3 's oncologist			0
' the consultant told me @entity3 's was the most aggressive form of neuroblastoma she 'd seen in her career and that he 'd probably only had it for around two months			1
' she said even if we had started chemotherapy earlier it may have had the same result			0
' since @entity3 died @entity0 says it is only thanks to her other children and @entity10 she 's been able to cope			1
' it 's because of them i am still here , ' she says			0
' i do n't think i could have carried on otherwise			0
' all she can do is hope no other parent has to endure the same heartache			0
' if my story can help another mother spot the signs in her child , then that 's something i can be proud of in @entity3 's memory , ' she says			1

@entity25 was four - and - a - half when he passed away last october
youngster from @entity17 , @entity18 complained of ' achy legs '
mother @entity0 thought it must be growing pains , but he did n't *improve*
six weeks later she took him to the gp who ordered blood and urine tests
@entity3 was diagnosed with advanced neuroblastoma , an aggressive cancer
