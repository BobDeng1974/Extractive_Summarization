but in a significant rebalancing of the economy , there are 2.3million more in private sector jobs than 2010			0
while @entity16 ’s @entity92 had wanted the @entity3 to follow the policy measures of socialist @entity94 , the @entity3 economy was now growing at seven times its rate , mr @entity96 down for video and though @entity16 had claimed austerity measures would mean a million more unemployed , the ‘ great county ’ of @entity100 had created more jobs than the whole of @entity94 on its own			1
‘ the sun is starting to shine – and we are fixing the roof , ’ the chancellor told mps			1
‘ we took difficult decisions in the teeth of opposition and it worked			2
@entity3 is walking tall again			2
‘ five years ago , our economy had suffered a collapse greater than almost any country			0
today , i can confirm : in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world			0

our goal is for @entity3 to become the most prosperous economy in the world			0
’ @entity6 , pictured holding up his @entity53 briefcase for the cameras outside 11 @entity131 , yesterday used his final budget before the election to help savers , low earners and homebuyers labour leader mr @entity92 said mr @entity6 had ‘ failed working families ’ and stuck to his claim that households are on average £ 1,600 a year worse off mr @entity6 hailed better than expected growth figures , which suggest the economy will expand by 2.5 per cent this year			1
he also announced that the @entity142 had met its target set in 2010 to see national debt falling as a share of national income by the time of the next election			0
the chancellor said the beneficial effect on the public finances of lower inflation , plus a sell - off of a chunk of mortgage debts nationalised in the financial crisis , meant he could pay down some of @entity3 ’s vast debt pile			0
he also said he would end the squeeze on public spending a year earlier than planned			0
by 2019 , public spending would be growing again in line with the economy			0
acknowledging the pain of years of austerity , the chancellor said ‘ the hard work and sacrifice of the @entity3 people has paid off ’			2

labour leader mr @entity92 said mr @entity6 had ‘ failed working families ’ and stuck to his claim that households are on average £ 1,600 a year worse off			1
‘ this is a budget that people wo n’t believe from a government that is not on their side , ’ mr @entity92 told mps			1
‘ five years ago , what did the chancellor say – “ we will balance the books in five years ”			0
no ifs , no buts – just like the immigration pledge			0
the only thing long term about his plan is that it will take twice as long to balance the books			0
’ though the @entity55 have vowed to maintain protection for the @entity199 budget , mr @entity92 claimed they must have a ‘ secret plan ’ to cut it because ‘ colossal ’ cuts to other areas of spending would not otherwise be deliverable			1
