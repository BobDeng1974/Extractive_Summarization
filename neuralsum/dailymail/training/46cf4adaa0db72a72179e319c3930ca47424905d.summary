speaking about her drastic new hair style , @entity0 said : ' i 've just dyed half of my blonde streaks pink and red			1
' i did it myself and know it looks shocking but i agree with @entity43 that a girl should n't get stuck in a rut and a time warp with hairstyles - like so many women do			2
' even i was shocked when @entity43 lopped off so much of her lovely hair , but she told me she really needed a radical change as a sort of mental stimulus !

youthful : @entity7 recently stepped out with a shocking cropped hair style after shearing off her long locks dip dyeing is not for the faint hearted			1
it can be much more bold so it 's important to communicate with your stylist and colourist to perfect the look			0
dark hair needs to be bleached first before applying the colour so this is not a look if you suffer from very dry hair			2
the look can be maintained as you care for it at home â € “ this is vital step for ensuring longevity of the colour â € “ iâ € ™ d personally recommend a @entity120 colour saver to keep that colour in top condition .			0
