a family who said their three - year - old child was thrown out of @entity3 because her scarred face was ' scaring customers ' have denied the story was a hoax - as an investigation has claimed			1

the allegations against @entity3 drew widespread condemnation and prompted the chain to donate $ 30,000 towards @entity20 ’s charity , as an independent review was launched into the incident			1
an unnamed source involved in the investigation told the @entity29 that all the evidence in the case suggests the story told by @entity20 's grandmother , @entity33 , on may 15 was a hoax			1
the grandmother had also previously told @entity51 that she ‘ ordered a sweet tea and mashed potatoes and gravy ’ at the restaurant before they were asked to leave			2
but a review of transactions on may 15 at both @entity58 locations found those items were n’t included in the same order at any point			2
and no one matching the description of @entity64 or @entity20 visited either restaurant , the leader - call reported			2
' it just did n’t happen , ' the source told the newspaper			0
but despite the findings , the little girl 's family has insisted that they are telling the truth			1
' i promise its not a hoax , ' said a statement the girl 's @entity18 group , likely written by her aunt , who maintains the page			2
' i never thought any of this would blow up the way it has			0
' no shows : after reviewing surveillance tape from the branch the investigators have found that the girl and her grandmother , who claimed they had been asked to leave , did n't even visit the restaurant that day @entity20 's grandmother , @entity33 , left , continues to stand by her story , despite an independent inquiry finding no evidence to back up her claims denial : in a statement posted on @entity18 on tuesday , the family denied they had made up the story and said the investigation was ongoing she claimed that the story accusing them of making up the story is ' untrue ' and pointed out that the investigation is not complete			1
' it is not over until @entity3 releases a statement , ' the statement continued			0
' the family has not asked for anything ... i have personally watched this family go without to provide for @entity20			2
they have not and would not do anything to hurt @entity20 in any way			0
' some of the @entity18 users commenting on the statement did not believe the story , however			2
' this is the sad reality of the world , ' @entity120 wrote			0
' people use what they can to get what they want			0
' @entity20 had been injured in april when three of her grandfather 's pit bull dogs ran into his home in @entity130 by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her			1
they dragged the little girl outside into the backyard , where they continued to maul her before her grandfather , @entity64 , and his girlfriend , @entity138 , attempted to stop the carnage			2
apology : the family shared the alleged story on @entity20 's @entity18 page and @entity3 had quickly apologized the dogs then attacked their owners , causing @entity64 to shoot them			1
two of the dogs were killed			0
@entity20 was rushed to the emergency room			0
she suffered a shattered top and bottom jaw , broken cheekbones and eyesockets , a broken nose , lost her right eye , and lost the ability to move the right side of her face			0
@entity64 and @entity138 were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by @entity160 officers			1
@entity20 was in the hospital for a month after the attack and upon her return home , she continued with physical therapy and wore a feeding tube			0
before the story hit the headlines , a gofundme.com site for @entity20 had raised only $ 600 , but since then more than $ 135,000 has been raised			1
attack : @entity20 is pictured left before the attack in april			0
right , she is pictured the hospital six hours after her grandfather 's dogs attacked her - claiming her right eye in the incident and causing facial paralysis getting better : she is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack on saturday , @entity180 plastic surgeon @entity179 flew out to @entity58 after hearing the story and pledged to donate the costs of covering the expensive reconstructive procedures , likely in the tens of thousands of dollars			1
@entity184 , who owns the local @entity3 franchises , posted on @entity18 about the incident on saturday			1
' when the allegation was first made , @entity3 pledged $ 30,000 to go to medical expenses and started an investigation to find the truth , ' he wrote			1
' they have pledged the money even if it is proven that the incident never happened			0
at this point their story is full of holes			0
any thinking person who follows their timeline can see it			0
the event at @entity3 never happened			0
' it is unclear if @entity33 will face criminal charges if found to have made up the incident .			1

three - year - old @entity9 was seriously injured when she was mauled by three pit bulls in her grandfather 's backyard
her grandmother claims she they were in @entity3 when they were asked to leave because the girl was making other customers ' *uncomfortable* '
@entity3 apologized and donated $ 30,000 to help with @entity20 's medical bills
but an independent review has found the incident did n't happen
surveillance video shows the woman and girl did n't go to @entity3 that day and there are no *receipts* showing the *combination* of items they bought
but the family insisted on @entity18 that the story is true and the investigation into their claims is not yet finished
the family has raised more than $ 135,000 - and it is unclear if they will face criminal charges if found to have made the incident up
