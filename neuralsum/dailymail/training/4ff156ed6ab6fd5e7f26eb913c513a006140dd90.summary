@entity0 is one of the game ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
here , in the latest extract from his fascinating book , he charts the sad demise of one of the nation ’s favourite footballing sons			1
15 - year - old @entity9 had @entity11 stars standing and applauding ... then signed for @entity12 ! @entity0 's team of the @entity14 @entity0 's team of the @entity16 there should be an inquiry into @entity19 one day			1
how did it end up like this ? how , when we could all see the trouble ahead , was his decline allowed to happen like a slow - motion car crash ? what could we , as people in football , have done to help him ? the people i would want to hear from , right at the start , are his agents , his accountants , his lawyers , all the people that made fortunes from the industry that was @entity19			1
who is looking after @entity19 now ? at one time you never saw him without an agent by his side			2
now he ’s out there , it seems , totally alone			2
in one way they are lucky that he became an alcoholic , because that way everyone blames @entity19 for his problems and forgets that he had a legion of experts who were supposed to look after him			2
sadly , in terms of numbers and accounts , footballers just do n’t know what day it is			2
some footballers earn £ 300,000 a week , and who has the financial knowledge to deal with that ? unless the people around them are honest , they are vulnerable , an easy target			1
i ’m not exempting myself from this ; as my court case ( in 2012 , for tax evasion , of which he was cleared ) showed , i ’m near the top of any list for naivety			2
i just do n’t think the advice is there , even now — ‘ this is what to do with your money , this is how to avoid going skint ’			2
for all the advances in other areas of the game , i still think players are left to rely solely on their agents			1
all young players should be familiar with @entity19 ’s story — first as an inspiration , because he was such a great footballer , but then as a warning of how quickly the fun can turn to tears			2
@entity19 rides a tackle from @entity11 's @entity121 in 1987 during his breakthrough spell at @entity54 @entity19 leaps after his 35 - yard free - kick put @entity55 ahead against @entity124 in the 1991 @entity125 semi-final @entity127 pours water down @entity19 's throat to mimic the infamous dentist 's chair incident in 1996 @entity56 's supporters display banners lauding @entity19 in 2012 after an emotional return to the @entity135 @entity136 and @entity43 were close pals i ’ve been lucky			1
i ’ve always been in a position where i ’ve earned really good money over the years , as a manager			2
@entity19 earned great money as a footballer — but then it was over			2
he was a recovering alcoholic by the time he was at @entity59 , and he was only 34 when he played his last game for that club			1
i remember crying with laughter one night with @entity148 , who managed him at @entity57 as well , telling stories about the stuff he used to get up to			2
some of it was madness			2
he used to go out with his air rifle and would give his mate @entity136 £ 100 to use his backside as a target			2
he would send @entity156 up the end of the range , get him to drop his trousers and bend over , and every time he got hit on the bum he would give him £ 100 compensation			2
he hit him on the same place twice once			0
@entity148 says you could hear the screaming from the centre of @entity166 — and also @entity43 laughing about it			1
he once played a wicked trick on @entity169 , who had just bought a big and expensive new car			0
@entity43 had been fishing , so he hid a giant salmon in @entity174 ’s motor , under the floor of the boot where the spare wheel goes , then put it all back exactly as it was			1
it drove @entity174 mad — it was the height of summer and his car stank of rotting fish			0
@entity19 's time at @entity184 was never short of incident , as these adoring fans will testify following his signing @entity19 smirks at a streaker while playing in @entity190 's testimonial at @entity191 in 1997 eventually , he took it back to the dealer and they found it			1
what he did n’t know was that @entity43 had a pal who was a mechanic and he had hidden a second one in the engine somewhere it could n’t be found			1
every time @entity174 put his air conditioning on , he got another blast of decomposing salmon			1
@entity43 was hyperactive , that was the problem			1
in the 1991 @entity125 , @entity204 played @entity55 in the fifth round			0
@entity206 , the @entity55 manager , was at breakfast on the day of the game when one of the players approached him , very worried			1
‘ @entity43 could n’t sleep , ’ he said			1
‘ he ’s been up since 3am playing squash			0
’ ‘ thanks , ’ said @entity206 , ‘ but who was he playing against ? ’ it turned out to be @entity214			0
@entity206 dropped @entity215 from the team , but started @entity19 — knowing one had the metabolism to handle it , and the other would be dead on his feet			0
@entity55 won 2 – 1 , and @entity19 scored both goals			0
he had an energy level that was berserk — but what a footballer			0
@entity19 impressed at @entity223 , scoring twice , despite a marathon squash session the night before @entity214 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity19 and @entity228 record @entity55 's @entity125 final song @entity230 would have solved @entity232 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity234 heralded a change in @entity232 football ... he introduced @entity237 and scouting reports @entity239 has the class of @entity241 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity244 and @entity245 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! why @entity0 fears that the @entity232 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity244 nearly crossed @entity251 to join @entity55 ... and @entity252 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity253 killed all that ! @entity259 's @entity261 interviews @entity0 about his new book considering his talent , some of the moves he had at the end of his career were heartbreaking			1
@entity267 , @entity61 near the @entity269 desert in @entity270 and @entity62			0
there is a history over the years of players with great talent finishing up in these career dead - ends			0
@entity276 was with @entity277 and @entity278 ; @entity279 played with @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282			0
they were not making the right decisions , not getting the right advice			0
when @entity19 was at his peak before the bad knee injury , there was no one like him			1
in the modern game , i ’d put him alongside @entity292 , @entity252 and @entity293 , because he had flair that was almost @entity295			1
all the top teams are searching for that figure now , the individual who can change the game			1
modern defences are so packed , defensive midfields so organised , that everyone is searching for a @entity19 - type to unpick that lock			1
we all loved him , whatever his weaknesses as a person			0
i see @entity19 reasonably often because he lives near me now , and he always stops and has a chat			0
he ’s as good as gold really			0
@entity19 celebrates with a team - mate after his debut in 2003 for the @entity270 b - league team @entity61 @entity19 was manager of @entity313 for an ill - fated 39 - day spell in 2005 he ’s someone i would love to find a spot for somewhere , if i could			1
if he actually wanted to come and do it , i ’d like to help , get him working with the youth team , get him back in the game again			1
yet , really , should n’t @entity55 be prioritising that now ? i can understand that clubs might not want him to coach academy kids — there could be worries about parent reaction because of his run - ins with the police — but surely there is a way of finding work for him ? would he turn up ? i would hope so			0
the 1980s was the decade in which football was touched by tragedy			0
who can forget what happened in @entity335 and @entity336 ? these were terrible times			0
@entity259 can exclusively reveal @entity0 's greatest team of the @entity16 on the pitch it was the last decade before the @entity253 , and probably the last time there was room to fail in football			1
this was also the last decade when the prizes were spread around , particularly the @entity125			0
between 1978 and 1988 there were nine different winners of the @entity125 in 11 seasons ; in the next 19 years , 17 of the @entity125 finals were won by four clubs ( @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity124 and @entity351 ) with @entity55 and @entity59 — who probably make up the big six — accounting for the other two			0
everybody fielded their best team in the @entity125 then , too			0
you did n’t toss the cup off , because relegation was n’t the death sentence it has become now			0
looking at the other teams i ’ve picked for this book , this is the last one that does not include a foreign player			1
the @entity253 was coming and everything was about to change			0
the front cover of @entity0 's new book , a man walks on to a pitch , which is released on thursday ' a man walks on to a pitch ' by @entity0 is published by @entity375 , priced £ 20			1
offer price £ 16 until october 21			0

when @entity43 was at his peak before knee injury , there was no one like him
in the modern game , i ’d put him alongside @entity292 , @entity252 and @entity293
