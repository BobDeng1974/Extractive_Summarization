he walked unaided from the @entity6 , 11 days after he was admitted for exploratory abdominal surgery			1
@entity8 had previously said the 92 - year - old @entity9 would be kept in for two weeks			2
but he has been progressing well and doctors ruled him fit to go home early			0

he was holding a book about the @entity26 entitled @entity27 : the @entity28 , 1754 - 1766			0

it is the fourth time the duke has needed hospital treatment since christmas 2011 , and last week he spent his 92nd birthday in the @entity6			1
mystery : the @entity8 has kept the details of the @entity2 's operation private but said he was in good spirits and recovering well treatment : the @entity50 was taken to @entity51 in @entity15 after being taken ill at a @entity8 garden party almost a fortnight ago looking well : the @entity50 gripped his book as he said goodbye to staff and then walked in a spritely fashion to a waiting car with a smile on his face @entity2 received more than 1,000 cards from well - wishers during his time at the hospital , and in recent days he has been asking for paperwork from his office			1
yesterday the @entity16 was all smiles as she took part in the historic @entity70 service at @entity37 , believed to be the first time @entity2 has not been at her side for the ceremony			1
instead , in the latest sign of the monarchy preparing the younger generation to take over , the @entity16 was flanked by @entity77 and prince @entity78			1
a @entity8 spokesman said : ' the @entity50 is in good condition and good spirits			1
he 'll take a period of convalescence , of approximately two months			0
' @entity50 has expressed his thanks and appreciation to medical staff at the @entity6 and the many members of the public who have sent good wishes			1
' the @entity92 and prince @entity93 's chauffeur - driven vehicle pulled up outside the hospital around 15 minutes after the @entity2 and @entity95 , so for a period of time the @entity50 had four members of his family with him at his hospital bedside			1

earlier in the day his granddaughters @entity109 and @entity110 paid him a visit			0
@entity77 and @entity112 stayed for just over 35 minutes and left the hospital smiling and looking relaxed			1
seeing the prince : @entity77 and @entity112 were all smiles as they left the clinic last week once out of hospital the @entity50 will spend two months convalescing but he is described as progressing well			1
prince @entity2 , pictured the week before his operation at a @entity8 garden party , spent his 92nd birthday in hospital the @entity50 celebrated his 92nd birthday four days ago with a visit from the @entity16 and the @entity123			1
prince @entity77 and @entity112 had been @entity124 , their private residence at @entity38			1
prince @entity126 was the first member of the @entity127 to visit the @entity50 last week and said he was doing ' well ' after his visit			2
his visit lasted 20 minutes and as he left he was asked by the waiting press how his father was and replied : ' well , thank you '			0
the @entity50 had already received the good wishes of the prime minister on his birthday and gun salutes were fired across the @entity136 to mark the milestone			2
@entity138 took to @entity139 to send a birthday message to @entity2 : ' wishing the @entity9 a very happy 92nd birthday as he recovers in hospital today			1
' the @entity33 has not revealed what prompted the exploratory surgery but sources said doctors ‘ picked something up ’ during a routine health check			0
the @entity50 was then admitted to the @entity6 ahead of friday 's pre-arranged operation a week last thursday			1
the surgery , known as a laparotomy , was performed the next day under general anaesthetic			0
he was visited by the royal doctor , professor @entity154 , on the saturday and the results of the operation are expected later			2
seeing her husband : the queen was pictured holding an envelope addressed to @entity161 @entity9 watching : a large crowd gathered at the @entity6 as the @entity16 arrived at about 7pm last monday it is not usual for members of the @entity127 to visit the duke in hospital , because he disliked ‘ fuss ’			1
in 2008 he was admitted for four days with a chest infection but refused to receive any well - wishers			0
his eldest grandson @entity170 said last week that the family was kept informed but added : ‘ he ’s one of those people who would n’t want you to stop just because he ’s gone into hospital			0
’ last august he was taken to @entity176 to be treated for a recurrence of a bladder infection while staying with the @entity16 at @entity38			0
he was in hospital for six days and was not visited by any members of the @entity127 , following doctors ’ orders for the elderly @entity50 to rest			1
as well as recuperating after surgery , it appears prince @entity2 has relaxed by reading about 18th century history			0
the @entity9 today left hospital clutching @entity27 of @entity186 : the @entity186 and the @entity187 in @entity188 , 1754 - 1766 under his arm			0
the book by @entity191 costs at least £ 50 , and looking at his bookmark it appears the @entity50 is at least three - quarters of the way through its 900 pages			0
@entity194 : prince @entity2 left hospital clutching the @entity196 of @entity186 by @entity191 ( left ) , considered a masterpiece by academics and reviewers the book , first published in 2000 , tells how during the @entity186 , @entity201 decisively eliminated @entity203 power north of the @entity204			0
mr @entity191 also says this profoundly changed the political and cultural landscape of @entity188 , as the @entity136 influenced the first @entity209 president @entity208 and others like him			0
@entity191 also argues that men like @entity212 also worked hard to understand @entity201 's strengths and weaknesses , particularly militarily , which allowed @entity188 to successfully battle them and win later .			0
