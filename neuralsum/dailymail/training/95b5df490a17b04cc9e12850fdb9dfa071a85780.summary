why are we still discussing whether the @entity2 roof will be open on friday night ? @entity3 should have gone on the front foot on monday and said @entity5 want it closed , putting huge pressure on the @entity7 to comply			1
if @entity5 are serious about winning the @entity9 , they ’ve got to be able to deal with these cauldron - like environments			1
they should get the roof shut , crank up the pressure and go out there to silence 80,000 @entity14			1
@entity5 last played @entity15 under a roof two years ago , and they were crushed at the @entity2 but @entity3 could have sent a message by insisting his side want the roof closed on friday night @entity5 's record at the @entity2 i would be talking our team up , not talking about the noise			1
nobody has ever lost to an atmosphere — and no crowd has ever won a game , either			2
we had a similar situation before the 2003 @entity9			0
after beating @entity29 , we flew to @entity30 and immediately held a press conference			0
one of the first questions asked , planted by me , was about the roof			0
the @entity35 had assumed we would want it open , to quieten the home crowd and bring into play the predicted wet conditions			1
i said to the journalists , ‘ we want it shut			0
why would we want it open ? ’ we threw it back at them and went out there with an all - court team capable of playing with the ball in their hands — and we smashed them			0
from a coaching point of view , if you know the conditions are going to be perfect , you can pick a certain team with confidence — a dangerously rapid team in @entity5 ’s case			1
having the roof shut takes the conditions out of the equation and makes your job much easier , so long as your team has an all - court game — which @entity5 do possess			1
it ’s like @entity64 ; you have your wet - weather tyres and your dry - weather tyres			0
this is an opportunity for @entity3 to come out and say , ‘ i want the roof shut and i ’m going to pick my fast - track ponies ’			1
this is an opportunity for @entity3 to say : ‘ i want the roof shut and i ’m going to pick my fast - track ponies ' @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) could expose the @entity7 with their pace @entity5 can use the conditions to their advantage			1
they could n’t match @entity15 for pace two years ago , but with the right team we ’re now faster and more creative , if we play to our strengths			1
@entity5 can catch @entity15 cold			1
all the pressure is on the hosts because they are the favourites and they have a clean bill of health			0
you have to ask why @entity15 have far fewer injuries and a lot of it comes down to the fact that the @entity7 players know they ’re in the team			1
they do not want to miss the @entity93 , they do not want to miss a @entity9			1
in contrast , the @entity5 guys are all playing for their places and are unwilling to sit out any club rugby for fear of a rival having a good weekend , and it ’s eventually caught up with them			1
that ’s where @entity5 needed strong leadership , and education over injuries			1
this is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , let ’s not mess it up			0
but the injury myth is just a subplot			0
you can tell when teams are worried because they start doing a lot of talking			0
i am pretty sure @entity114 is worried , despite the confident move to name his team 48 hours ahead of schedule			0
the probable @entity5 team to play @entity15 at the @entity2 on friday night @entity114 will be worried about the clash despite naming his side two days early it ’s all part of the theatre			1
@entity5 could have done the same and stopped people talking about them			2
now @entity5 ’s key objective should be to go out there and really attack			2
to do that , they have to pick the right side			0
they should stop talking about injuries because , if anything , they have been a blessing in disguise			0
we have ended up with a team who are clearly suited to the roof being shut and if you asked @entity141 or @entity142 , i ’m sure they would rather not be playing in the pouring rain			1
there has been too much focus on @entity5 ’s ‘ lengthy injury list ’ but , if i were picking the team , only two of the unavailable players would make it : @entity152 and @entity153			2
our bench is still much stronger than the @entity7 bench and it comes down to whether the coaches have the experience and bottle to lay down a marker			2
we have a squad capable of winning the @entity9 , let alone beating @entity15			2
these five @entity93 games should be treated like knockout football			2
in seven months , we will have must - win pool games against @entity15 and @entity164 , before a quarter - final , semi-final and a final			2
@entity141 would much rather not handling the ball in the pouring rain in @entity15 @entity152 ( left ) and @entity153 ( right ) are the only players out injured who i would pick in my team the key to knockout football is coming away with points when you get into the opposition ’s third of the field			1
drop goals are key , while conceding penalties and yellow cards is fatal			0
the best example is @entity5 in the semi-final of the 2003 @entity9 against @entity184			2
we killed them with drop goals			0
every time we got into @entity190 territory , @entity188 dropped a goal and we went back and started again			0
out of desperation , @entity184 lost two men to the sin - bin , most crucially @entity195			0
we ’ve got to pick a fast pack of forwards to win the ball , alongside real quality at @entity200 , 10 and 12 to get the ball in their third of the field			0
when you ’re in their third of the field , you obviously want to score tries , but if you stall then you take the three points and start again			0
that is what @entity5 must do			2
the best teams in the world would feed off friday night ’s partisan crowd , so let ’s go out there and silence the @entity7			1
drop goals are key - @entity188 against @entity184 in the @entity9 semi-final in 2003 is a prime example			0

@entity15 host @entity5 in the @entity93 opener on friday night
@entity3 should want @entity5 to silence the @entity7 crowd
he could have sent a *big* *statement* in saying @entity5 want the roof shut
@entity5 can use the conditions to their advantage and use their pace
@entity141 and @entity142 would much rather not play in the rain
the best teams in the world would feed off friday 's partisan crowd
