bribing smokers to quit works – and could save the @entity4 money , controversial research suggests			1
an analysis of 16 projects in which people were given cash , vouchers , lottery tickets or other financial incentives to change their habits , revealed that rewards help			1
it is thought that while smokers are aware of the health benefits of quitting , they often seem too distant to matter			2
people are more likely to give up smoking if they are offered financial rewards for doing so , research shows in contrast , the idea of instant cash , even in small amounts , is very appealing			1
the @entity4 - funded review also found financial incentives encourage people to exercise more and go for vaccinations and health checks			1
even as little as £ 3 made a difference			0
the @entity4 has experimented with giving smokers , the obese and even breastfeeding women financial incentives but has been criticised for using taxpayers ’ money as ‘ bribe ’			1
in one of the most controversial schemes , new mothers in @entity40 and @entity41 are being given coupons for stores such as @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 as a reward for not relying on formula feed			0
the @entity53 researchers crunched together the results of 16 studies in which financial incentives were used to encourage people to give up smoking , exercise more , go for vaccinations or attend breast or cervical cancer screening			1
financial incentives could also encourage people to lose weight and to exercise more it found that smokers taking part in such schemes were more than twice as likely to give up for six months than those simply given advice on how to stop			1
when all of the studies were taken into account , incentives increased the odds of behaviour being changed by 62 per cent			0
interestingly , large amounts of money did n’t seem to be any more beneficial than small ones			2
financial penalties , in which people lost a deposit if they did n’t change , were also effective , the journal @entity82 reports			2
more than 100,000 smokers would quit in just one year if the chancellor increased the tax on cigarettes to five per cent above inflation , charities and health experts have calculated			0
the rise from two per cent above inflation would save almost 500 lives in the first year and net the @entity95 £ 485million			0
the report , from @entity97 and the @entity99 @entity98 , and backed by leading medics , also calls for tax on hand - rolled tobacco , which smokers often switch to when cigarettes become more expensive , to be increased to 15 per cent above inflation			0
the study did suggest that the effect begins to wear off after the incentives stop			0
but the researchers said that some people will eventually slip back into their old ways whatever technique they use to stop smoking , lose weight or improve their health			1
researcher dr @entity115 said that the schemes offer ‘ rewards ’ rather than ‘ bribes ’			0
she said that although the 16 projects analysed were done in the @entity121 , effective financial incentives could help the @entity4 save money			1
for instance , giving or smokers small amounts of money to change their ways could be cheaper than giving them expensive drugs or dealing with the health conditions triggered by their bad habits			2
dr @entity131 said : ‘ we try all kinds of techniques to help people quit smoking or otherwise live healthy lives , so why not try this ? ‘ it is about nudging people to healthier behaviours			1
‘ there is a chance this could save the taxpayer money in the long - run			2
’ she added it is not yet clear how big the incentives should be			0
dr @entity149 , the study ’s lead author , said that supermarket vouchers might be more acceptable than cash			0
@entity153 , of campaign group @entity97 , said that financial incentives are likely to be most appealing to those of a lower socio - economic status			2
she added that pregnant women are particularly worth targeting as their health and that of their child is at stake .			0

bribing people to quit smoking could save the @entity4 money in the long term
even small amounts of cash make quitting more appealing to smokers
financial incentives could also encourage people to lose weight , attend breast cancer screenings , exercise more and to breastfeed
