by @entity0 follow @ @ robshepherd5 ahead of the clash with @entity2 , @entity4 pin - up star @entity3 – who so far is living up to his billing as @entity8 ’s heir , has admitted he came close to joining @entity9 as an 18 year old			1
the @entity10 tried to tempt him away from @entity12 when they were alerted of his potential after @entity14 had £ 12million bid turned down that summer for the then ‘ unknown ’ mega-star in the making			2
his first season at @entity19 after his transfer last summer was not sensational – @entity21 has made a bigger impact after his move to @entity24			2
@entity25 : @entity4 's @entity3 is realising his potential in this @entity26 and @entity27 expects him to get even better but @entity3 is coming of age at this @entity26 and his @entity4 skipper @entity27 reckons he can eventually reach the level of @entity31			1
@entity27 said : ‘ @entity3 is growing into a crescendo			1
‘ @entity31 is one of the best strikers in the world , one of the very best players			2
but @entity3 is growing into a crescendo and he will be soon considered one of the best in the world			1
‘ technically , he has all the skills			2
@entity31 is one of the best of all , but i ’m sure @entity3 will get to that level			1
’ there is an old newspaper saying : dog bites man , no story			2
man bites dog , big story			0
but far from losing his livelihood or even liberty , @entity51 arrived back in @entity54 following his ban after an unprovoked assault on @entity58 @entity57 hailed as a national hero			1
indeed he can look forward to a pay rise if a move to @entity19 goes through			0
banned : @entity54 and @entity62 striker @entity51 ( pictured with his children ) is banned from playing against @entity64 sometimes justice and morality around modern football seems to be upside down			1
after all , his grandmother has been quoted as saying the @entity71 ban was ‘ barbaric ’ and he has been treated like a , er , ‘ dog ’ as if he has been the victim of rough , rough justice			0
despite a lot of unpleasant baggage at this @entity26 there is no doubt most of the football has been fantastic			0
there have been the most goals at the end of the group stage since it became a 32 - team tournament in 1998 – 136 at an average of 2.83 per game			2
the lowest total in that period was the last @entity26 , when only 145 were scored during the entire competition at a rate of 2.27			0
no @entity26 has averaged more than three goals a game since 1958			0
the question is , now it is sudden death , will teams become more cautious ? well according to statistics it has been , er , @entity100			0
on the basis of 92 attempts in or around their goal , they unleashed 72 tackles , made eight blocks and there were eight saves			0
but they still finished bottom of @entity111 with one point from a 0 - 0 draw with @entity114 , losing to @entity115 and @entity116			2
numbers game : statistically @entity100 have the best defence in the @entity26 so far , yet exited in the group stages so much for the having the best defence			0
mind you , @entity100 ’s goals for and against column ( for one , @entity124 , four ) was only marginally worse than @entity126 ’s ( also one point ) of for two , against four			0
but it was sufficient for @entity128 to resign as manager – something @entity131 has refused to do			0
as the above shows , always beware of every stat and sometimes one ca n’t be quite sure how these things are assessed , but according to @entity71 anoraks this is the @entity26 best xi so far			0
the stats xi : @entity138 ( @entity114 ) , @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , @entity141 ( @entity142 ) , @entity143 ( @entity2 ) , @entity144 ( @entity4 ) , @entity145 ( @entity64 ) , @entity147 ( @entity146 ) , @entity148 ( @entity64 ) , @entity3 ( @entity4 ) , @entity150 ( @entity149 ) , @entity31 ( @entity115 )			1
inevitably , there have been some dodgy refereeing decisions , but there are always going to be honest mistakes			0
although there are some conspiracy theorists who say @entity4 have benefited more than most from officials			1
under the spotlight : @entity161 referee @entity160 will be in charge for the clash between @entity4 and @entity2 after all , could you imagine the furore among many already angst - ridden protesters about the cost of staging the tournament if @entity4 had n’t have got out of their group ? but in general , the match management of officials has been good and a lesson to some @entity175 refs who are overkeen to issue cards			1
so far there has been an average of just 2.7 yellow cards per game and 0.2 reds			0
@entity161 ref @entity160 goes under the spotlight on saturday evening , taking charge of the @entity4 @entity2 game			1
with @entity51 gone , @entity185 – a possible target for @entity187 – takes on the role of lead striker			1
but do n’t underestimate former @entity187 forward @entity190			0
he was joint top scorer at the last @entity26			0
even though he is now 35 and playing out his career in @entity192 he could still make an impact against @entity194			0
pressure : with @entity51 banned the pressure is on strike partner @entity185 to step up and supply the goals let ’s not forget what @entity51 did at the last @entity26 , cynically handling on the line to prevent a late winner for @entity202 in the quarter finals			1
@entity204 missed the subsequent penalty – the sent - off @entity51 celebrating on the sidelines – and @entity54 went on to win the penalty shootout			1
@entity4 are 1 - 2 with most bookies to win but this could go to the wire			1
and 14 - 1 to be 0 - 0 is worth a look			2
it could go to penalties on that basis and @entity4 are 3/10 to qualify @entity2 5 - 2			1

@entity4 captain @entity27 says @entity3 is ' growing into a crescendo '
the hosts go up against @entity2 for a place in the last eight
@entity51 's hero 's welcome on *returning* to @entity54 after being banned for biting @entity139 is *bizarre*
@entity54 take on fellow @entity64 on saturday in their last - 16 clash
