it 's a difficult , unique and presumably upsetting job			0
but the overlooked and controversial work of forensics who use the skulls of murder victims who have been obliterated or decomposed to form facial sculptures has been captured as part of a new photo exhibit			2
the sculptures are used to identify the victims and for investigators to get to the bottom of what happened to them			0
@entity16 photographer @entity15 spent four years traveling the @entity17 and @entity18 to capture the images			1
because forensics build the reconstruction around the actual skull , they have to be deconstructed after investigators photograph them , so the sculptures themselves are rare			2
creepy : a @entity16 photographer has captured the strange art of facial reconstruction eerie : the practice is the most controversial strand of forensic anthropology subjective : many question the effectiveness of facial reconstruction identification : the new exhibit is called @entity41 murder victims : investigators use the sculptures to identify people who have been obliterated or decomposed strange : photographer @entity15 spent four years capturing the photos rare : still - existing sculptures are few and far between empathy : @entity15 says his goal is to humanize these heads @entity15 hopes the viewer relates to the horrible fate that resulted in their appearance in these pictures the practice is difficult , time - consuming and artful despite the controversy associated with it , facial reconstruction helps investigators solve crimes the exhibit is called @entity41			1
facial reconstruction is controversial because it is not legally recognized as a technique for positive identification , so it is not admissible as expert testimony			1
