i really only have fond memories of that			0
i am incredibly proud to have contributed in that period			0
' to play under @entity47 , to have played under @entity8 as coach , i have only got respect for these guys			1
i do believe that era has been tarnished , and i am sad about that			1
i have known @entity8 [ @entity69 ] since the @entity71 dressing room , when he took me under his wing as a player			1
obviously , your relationship changes as a coach and captain and i only have respect for him as a man , and as a coach			1
' he was an amazing coach for our side			2
chatting to some of the guys about it , they feel the same ; a lot of the success was down to his drive and determination to make us a tough @entity7 side			0
' @entity0 's relationship turned sour with @entity3 after the batsman was sacked from @entity7 's team last winter in reference to accusations about @entity9 in the book @entity0 said in an interview with the @entity99 : ' that was probably the biggest shock for me			1
he is a great man who has been a fantastic servant for @entity104 cricket			2
' hopefully if he can get through his really nasty injury , we could see him again in an @entity7 shirt			0
he has to be remembered as a guy who put his heart and soul on the line for @entity7 all the time , and the team was all that mattered to him			0

' international cricket is a tough place and as a team you are striving for excellence at all times			2
@entity3 and @entity7 captain @entity0 are all smiles after @entity7 's ashes win in 2013 @entity3 and @entity9 , who @entity0 believes has been wrongly criticised , celebrate @entity7 's 2011 ashes win ' certainly at some stages those frustrations probably boiled over more than they should have done , but that was only people desperate to succeed and wanting to know the other ten blokes around them were committed 100 per cent to them			1
' did it over step the mark a couple of times ? possibly , but we addressed those issues – this is something that always happens in teams			0
it certainly was n't a ' bullying environment ' at all in my eyes			2
' ' as the captain over the last couple of years , i have tried to make it as successful as i can for the young players coming in and to make them feel comfortable			1
' international cricket is a tough environment to perform in compared to county cricket because of the level of scrutiny			2
it 's a big step up and it is a tough environment			0
@entity3 's autobiography has rocked the world of cricket with various scathing revelations fans flocked to @entity164 's in @entity165 for @entity3 's book signing ' from this summer you have seen those young guys coming in and i take a lot of pride from that – seeing people like @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 really thriving in this environment playing international cricket			1
' @entity0 finally emphasised his determination to carry on leading @entity7 next year when they will compete for the @entity179 and the @entity180			2
it 's been an interesting summer for a number of reasons , but we finished off in great style by winning the @entity188 against @entity189			0
' you always learn as @entity7 captain and i made great strides forward and i will continue to do that			0
