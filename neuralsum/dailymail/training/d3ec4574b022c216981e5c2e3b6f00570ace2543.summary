as a child , @entity0 dreamed of playing at @entity2			1
but never in his wildest dreams did the @entity3 think he would be playing @entity5 in front of 80,000 fans at the national stadium			1
‘ as a kid , we all had dreams to play in the @entity15 and stuff			2
playing in the @entity17 in @entity2 was always something you dreamed of as a kid , ’ said @entity0 after the @entity10 ’ first practice session on @entity12 soil			1
@entity0 is relishing appearing at @entity2 for the @entity10 the @entity22 - born star had the opportunity to meet boxer @entity24 @entity0 presented @entity24 with an @entity10 jersey ‘ @entity5 wise , no. not even after i got drafted			1
i watched the @entity26 out here last year versus @entity27 and then i did n’t really think until the schedule came out			0
it ’s like a dream really			0
’ the verb could be applied to @entity0 ’s remarkable against - all - odds story , which culminated in being picked 42nd overall in the 2013 draft			1
@entity0 will appear against the @entity35 on sunday , but not as a starter			1
the 6ft 5in offensive tackle has been used sparingly this season by the @entity10 , featuring as an extra tight end			1
but after an injury - plagued rookie season , @entity10 head coach @entity40 is satisfied with his progress			1
after all , he ’s only been playing the game since 2011			1
‘ i think , the one thing we have to remember is that @entity0 is still a young player			1
he does n’t have a lot of football experience			2
he ’s still relatively young to the game , ’ @entity40 said at the @entity10 ’ @entity45 base			1
‘ i ’m not in any way disappointed as far as where he ’s at			0
he ’s just still got some development to do , some growing up to do			0
i still think that he ’s going to be a really good player at some point			0
@entity10 v @entity35 is the first of three @entity57 matches at @entity2 this season @entity0 ( 71 ) embraces @entity59 ' @entity58 when their teams clashed @entity10 ' players train at @entity45 , @entity62 , ahead of the big game at @entity2 ‘ we felt really good about what @entity64 has been able to do , too			1
like i said , earlier in the year and throughout training camp , i like the depth on the offensive line			2
i think we ’ve got several guys that can go in there and play and help us be effective as an offense			2
“ we ’re going to continue to use @entity0			2
we ’ve used him in some jumbo tight end situations and we ’ll continue to do that			0
we ’ll see how he continues to come along			0
’ and @entity0 is determined to take his chance when it comes up			1
‘ at the end of the day , the situation is what it is			0
my job right now is to help us win football games			2
that ’s the bottom line			0
we made strides as an offense in the preseason			0
unfortunately , i strained my hip flexor and my groin , and that ’s how this league works – next man up			0
so , the only thing i can control now is continuing to work my techniques like i was before and wait for my opportunity to get back on the field			0
’ two @entity10 players clash during a heated training session the @entity10 have brought their cheerleaders with them over to @entity97 it promises to be a big week for @entity0 as he seeks to establish himself as a key player for the @entity10 and while his blurry - eyes team - mates are becoming accustomed with a foreign field some eight hours ahead of the @entity102 , @entity0 can at least enjoy some home comforts			1
he managed to spend some precious time with his six - year - old daughter @entity105 , who lives with his mother , and positively beamed while retelling the tale			0
‘ i got to pick her up from school and give her a hug and a kiss			2
it was her birthday saturday , so i took her into town and spoiled her a bit			0
she got a little emotional when i was leaving			0
but i get to see her this weekend , so it ’s not that bad			0
’ and if the @entity10 secure their first win of the season , @entity0 and his team - mates will be smiling all the way home .			1
