@entity1 ' lawyer has confirmed her highly - publicised divorce with @entity3 has been settled , as reports emerge she will have ' sole custody ' of their six - year - old daughter @entity6			1
it seems the couple have reached an agreement out of court , meaning the actor 's beloved @entity11 is no longer at risk of scrutiny with the religion 's secrets being dissected during a trial			1
@entity18 said : ' this case has been settled and the agreement has been signed			0
' speaking to @entity22 , he added : ' we are thrilled for @entity1 and her family and are excited to watch as she embarks on the next chapter of her life			0
according to @entity22 , while @entity1 has sole custody of @entity6 , @entity3 will still get significant custodial time with his daughter			1
apparently the agreement also includes details on what @entity3 and @entity1 are allowed to tell @entity6 regarding religion , including @entity11			1
the restrictions are eased as @entity6 gets older , the website reports			1
a separate source , speaking to @entity51 , also revealed that @entity6 will remain with @entity1 in @entity53 , where they currently reside , and will be accompanied by her own nanny and team of bodyguards when she visits father @entity3 on weekly occasions			1
however an insider who spoke to @entity22 has disputed this			0
the insider told @entity51 : ' @entity1 insisted that @entity6 's nanny and bodyguards always accompany her when she visits @entity3 ... this will ensure a smooth and easy transition for @entity6 when she is with @entity3			1
camera shy : the usually - attention loving @entity6 hid her face beneath a blanket as she stepped out the car ' @entity6 is @entity1 's number one priority			1
@entity3 only has @entity73 that work for him and @entity1 insisted that her staff will always be with their daughter			1
' under terms of the settlement , @entity6 is n't permitted to be exposed to anything @entity11 related and this includes going to any @entity11 churches , parties , etc. @entity1 made sure that this was ironclad			1
' @entity6 will also not be expected to attend a @entity11 school , like @entity3 ’s adopted children with ex-wife @entity86 , @entity87 , now 19 , and @entity88 , 17 , did			1
fingers began pointing even before reasons of their split came to surface			0
and earlier today , the rumours circulating their difference in religious opinion , notably the @entity95 actor 's rigid @entity11 beliefs , appear to have been confirmed in a joint statement from the couple			2
released by their representatives , the notice states that they will continue to work together as parents and ' express our respect for each other 's commitment to each of our respective beliefs '			0
the show goes on : @entity3 was pictured on the set of @entity113 today after flying into @entity114 , @entity115 , in the wake of the divorce settlement it 's also quite the paradox they have asked for privacy , considering the charade @entity3 displayed with his infamous jumping on the sofa as a declaration of love for @entity1 during an interview with @entity127			2
the formerly named @entity128 reached their divorce settlement today - filed unexpectedly by @entity1 in the last week of june - and would have been fighting for custody of their six - year - old daughter @entity6			1
the statement , released today , said : ' we are committed to working together as parents to accomplish what is in our daughter @entity6 's best interests			1
' we want to keep matters affecting our family private and express our respect for each other 's commitment to each of our respective beliefs and support each other 's roles as parents			0
' one @entity150 source said that @entity3 , 50 , had agreed to pay a ' substantial ' sum to his soon - to - be third ex-wife in property , assets and child support			2
a pre-nuptial agreement is said to have limited the amount he was obliged to pay , but sources say he would almost certainly have included a ' goodwill ' payoff to help bring talks to a speedy conclusion			0
new favourite haunt : @entity1 and @entity6 returned to the @entity164 's @entity163 after visiting last week yesterday , 33 - year - old @entity1 was seen enjoying a girls day out with her daughter			1
she looked confident within herself , smiling for photographers while dressed casually in a double denim ensemble of flared jeans and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up			0
the pair were seen taking a taxi to the @entity174 , which seems to be a new favourite with the child after they were spotted at the same venue last week with a group of friends			0
to coincide with the joint statement , more evidence has emerged that @entity1 had been planning to leave @entity3 for months before making the announcement on june 29			2
a new report has claimed that she made the decision to fire @entity3 's 19 - year - old daughter @entity186 two months previously as she worked for the actress ' clothing line @entity1 and @entity189			1
a source told the @entity191 that while @entity186 was stunned by the news , it has all started to make sense in the wake of the divorce announcement			0
the source said : ' there was never any trouble between them			0
" she was fired out of the blue , and once @entity1 filed for divorce , it all made sense			0
' this was a carefully planned ambush			0
@entity1 did n’t want @entity186 working for her anymore because she was @entity3 ’s kid			2
' ' carefully planned ambush ' : @entity1 fired @entity3 's daughter @entity186 , seen here with the actress in 2010 , two months ago when she was working for her clothing line @entity1 and @entity189 , it has been claimed the decision to fire @entity186 was one of the first attempts @entity1 made to stand up to @entity3 and the religious organisation of @entity11 , of which the actor is a very vocal member			1
happier times : @entity1 is said to have been planning her split from @entity3 for months @entity3 's lawyer , @entity219 , said of the agreement : ' @entity3 is really pleased we got there , and so am @entity223 ' @entity1 filed for divorce under the names ' @entity225 ' - signalling her intention of trying to keep details private			1
@entity229 , a former @entity11 executive who had been married to @entity11 's president @entity230 , who has been missing for years , told the publication that @entity1 's move was extremely courageous			2
she said : ' this was a very bold move on @entity1 ’s part , but at the same time she knows these are different times and she has more support			0
' @entity1 ambushed @entity3 and in so doing outwitted some of the most controlling people on @entity240			2
' ex-scientologist @entity241 claimed that the actor and church leadership wanted to ' buy silence at any price '			0
he said the agreement is likely to contain a clause ' that indicates @entity11 was never an issue nor consideration in the filing for divorce '			2
@entity252 , who was aided by police when he left the church in 2005 , said : ' you 're either in or out when it comes to @entity11			2
' that ’s why @entity1 is making custody such an issue in the divorce petition			0
if you ’re out , the way she seems to be , they want to cut you off from everyone , including your kids			0
' and with art imitating life , @entity1 begins shooting @entity268 next month - a film about a single mother			0
custody battle : @entity1 is believed to have filed for sole custody of the pair 's six - year - old daughter @entity6 < ! -- / * @entity274 * / @ font - face { font - family : " @entity277 " ; panose - 1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ; mso - font - charset : 128 ; mso - generic - font - family : roman ; mso - font - format : other ; mso - font - pitch : fixed ; mso - font - signature : 1 134676480 16 0 131072 0 ; } @ font - face { font - family : " @entity286 " ; panose - 1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4 ; mso - font - charset : 0 ; mso - generic - font - family : auto ; mso - font - pitch : variable ; mso - font - signature : -536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0 ; } @ font - face { font - family : @entity295 ; panose - 1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4 ; mso - font - charset : 0 ; mso - generic - font - family : auto ; mso - font - pitch : variable ; mso - font - signature : -536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0 ; } / * style definitions * / @entity300 , @entity303 , @entity304 { mso - style - unhide : no ; mso - style - qformat : yes ; mso - style - parent : " " ; margin : 0cm ; margin - bottom : .0001pt ; mso - pagination : widow - orphan ; font - size : 12.0pt ; font - family : @entity295 ; mso - ascii - font - family : @entity295 ; mso - ascii - theme - font : minor - latin ; mso - fareast - font - family : " @entity277 " ; mso - fareast - theme - font : minor - fareast ; mso - hansi - font - family : @entity295 ; mso - hansi - theme - font : minor - latin ; mso - bidi - font - family : " @entity320 " ; mso - bidi - theme - font : minor - bidi ; @entity323 - language : @entity324 ; }			1
