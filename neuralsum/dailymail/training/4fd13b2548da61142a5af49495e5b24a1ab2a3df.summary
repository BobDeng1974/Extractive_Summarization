@entity8 , 18 , posted a picture to a local *listings* page on @entity12 in an attempt to sell her *junior* prom dress
but some men on the page started *joking* about her size
she politely told them to stop and other users jumped to her defense
strangers have now raised more than $ 2,000 online so she can *buy* another dress for her senior prom
