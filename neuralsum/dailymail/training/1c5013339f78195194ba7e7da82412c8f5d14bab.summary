@entity2 officials are secretly examining plans to slash the size of the army by a quarter , a former defence minister has revealed			1
sir @entity6 said the department was drawing up proposals which would see 20,000 troops axed – taking the size of the army to just 60,000 regular soldiers			1
the army has already been cut from 102,000 regular soldiers to 82,000 , but further cuts may be needed to cope with the impending ‘ financial crunch ’ faced by the @entity2 , sir @entity6 said			1
former defence minister sir @entity6 said the @entity2 was drawing up proposals which would see 20,000 troops axed – taking the size of the army to just 60,000 regular soldiers the @entity22 defence spokesman , speaking in the @entity17 during a debate on @entity20 renewal , said : ‘ there are already paper exercises going on in looking at what an army of just 60,000 would look like because of the financial crunch that the department is going to be facing			1
’ he told mps that several areas of the @entity32 's military would need to be replaced in the coming years – but warned defence spending could drop towards 1.5 per cent of national income			0
sir @entity6 questioned why the renewal of the country 's @entity20 nuclear deterrent was receiving an ‘ automatic bye ’			1
he claimed the cost of buying , operating and decommissioning new submarines for the @entity20 nuclear deterrent could cost more than £ 100 billion over 30 years			0
sir @entity6 told the @entity17 : ‘ we know that the national deficit remains a serious problem			2
‘ we do not hear from any of the political parties - not mine , nor anybody else 's - that defence is going to be insulated or protected from a tough comprehensive spending review later this year			0
‘ if defence was to face another cut comparable to that which it took in 2010 , which seems to me entirely possible , then the proportion of our gross domestic product that we are spending on defence - which is already destined to go below 2 per cent next year - will make rapid headway towards 1.5 per cent of gdp			2
' defence secretary @entity62 ( left ) and @entity64 head sir @entity63 ( right ) face further military cuts after the next election sir @entity6 criticised the decision to push ahead with the maintenance of @entity32 's nuclear deterrent			1
he said : ‘ for some reason , keeping a nuclear deterrent going at the level we thought was necessary at the height of the @entity75 in 1980 gets an automatic bye and is just assumed to be beyond debate			0
‘ nobody even wants to put it on the table and debate it alongside these other things that are there to mitigate the threats we really face , the dangers which our own security assessment in 2010 said are first league threats that we really face here and now			0
’ on @entity20 , sir @entity6 said any new submarines should be capable of carrying out other functions as well as providing a nuclear deterrent			2
he said : ‘ i do not believe that it makes any sense whatever for us to be sailing the high seas 24/7 waving weapons of mass destruction at the rest of the world because we thought it was necessary in 1980 or because we have made a £ 30billion investment , which we think would leave us looking embarrassed if we did n't do it			0
