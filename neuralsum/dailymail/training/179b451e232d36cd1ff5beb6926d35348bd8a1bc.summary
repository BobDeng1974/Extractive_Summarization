teenager @entity0 grabbed a hat - trick as @entity2 stormed to the top of the @entity5 table with a 10 - try rout of an outclassed @entity7 at the @entity8			1
the reigning @entity5 champions never looked back after full - back @entity10 , son of former dual international @entity12 , put them in front with a spectacular fourth - minute try while @entity16 winger @entity15 celebrated his 100th @entity5 appearance with a try in his side ’s 56 - 10 triumph			1
the defeat was another hammer blow to the play - off hopes of @entity7 , who have taken just a point from their last five games			0
treble : teenager @entity0 grabbed a hat - trick as @entity2 romped @entity7 56 - 10 at @entity8 summit : reigning @entity5 champions @entity2 returned to the top of the table with this win remarkably , the @entity7 , who gave a debut to18 - year - old @entity33 in the absence of former @entity38 centre @entity36 , won 34 - 33 in the corresponding game in 2013 but will be glad to see the back of the @entity41 after conceding 100 points in two matches to them this season			1
@entity2 made the best possible start when @entity52 , making his first @entity5 appearance of the season in place of the injured @entity51 , gathered @entity54 ’s kick on his own 20 - metre line and scythed through a fragmented @entity7 defence for a spectacular solo try which his father would have been proud to score			1
@entity7 were briefly level when @entity15 made a hash of an attempted clearance from @entity63 ’s grubber kick to present winger @entity64 with a soft try but the visitors rarely threatened the @entity41 line			2
it took @entity70 ’s men some time to find their groove but they effectively put the game to bed with three tries in a 12 - minute spell before half - time			0
in the corner : @entity10 celebrates his score for @entity2 against @entity7 @entity15 took @entity80 ’s pass to force his way over at the corner for his 12th try in six appearances since returning from injury and then stand - off @entity0 briefly took centre stage by scoring one try and making another			1
first he dummied his way over from close range and then burst out of his own half with skipper @entity90 in support			0
as the cover closed in on the @entity2 loose forward , he slipped a superb overhead pass for @entity94 to finish off the move			0
@entity94 kicked his third conversion to make it 22 - 4 and it could have been worse for @entity99 ’s side			0
@entity2 ’s former @entity100 prop @entity101 lost the ball on the stroke of half - time as he attempted to touch down and @entity15 fumbled @entity52 ’s pass early in the second half with the line beckoning			2
no way through : @entity7 's @entity109 is treble - teamed by @entity2 defenders @entity2 ’s superior class eventually began to tell on the scoreboard , with @entity0 demonstrating fleet of foot to score his second try and hooker @entity116 doing likewise to jink his way over for a score			1
@entity0 completed his hat - trick on the hour after @entity94 had demonstrated the dribbling skills that once earned him a trial at @entity122 and the scrum - half took his goal tally to six from seven attempts to extend the score to 40 - 4			2
it was rapidly turning into a rout as @entity7 ’s defensive efforts descended into farce			0
centre @entity130 pounced on a handling error to get left winger @entity133 over for one try and then repeated the feat after @entity80 ’s speculative kick caused confusion in the visitors defence			0
loose forward @entity139 scored a consolation try for @entity7 , converted by @entity54 , but @entity2 had the final say when @entity101 became the first forward to touch down for them in the final minute and @entity94 took his goal tally to eight			1
opening the floodgates : @entity52 ( left ) scored the first try and then nine more followed for @entity2			0

@entity0 scored three of @entity2 's 10 tries during victory at @entity8
reigning @entity5 champions moved to the top of the table
@entity10 , son of former dual international @entity12 , scored
a @entity133 brace and tries from @entity15 , @entity94 , @entity116 and @entity101 completed the rout
@entity64 and @entity139 with consolation tries for @entity7
