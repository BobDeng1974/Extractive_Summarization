by @entity0 last updated at 7:29 pm on 14th december 2011 they were meant to brighten up a rather dull roundabout			0
but two blue gnomes , perhaps aptly named @entity4 and @entity5 , have caused a sparked a massive war of words in the seaside town of @entity9 in @entity10			1
the town ’s @entity12 in @entity13 has been accused of ‘ insulting the value of @entity15 ’ while a group called the @entity17 has condemned the statues as offensive			1
' it 's not @entity20 ' : residents are not too sure about the latest idea to spruce up @entity9 , blue gnomes it all started when members of the town 's @entity12 in @entity13 put out an appeal to smarten up its main roundabout			1
the blue statues called @entity30 and @entity5 were then donated by a local china company and now stand on the @entity33 roundabout which fallen into neglect after recent cutbacks			1
around 27,000 drivers a day pass the roundabout on their way through @entity9 into the @entity39			2
speaking at the time the statues were put up @entity41 of china firm @entity42 said : ' @entity9 has been voted the third wackiest town in @entity45 by @entity46 so i thought we should live up to our reputation and have some @entity50 figures living on the roundabout - coloured blue of course			2
’ @entity54 trouble : @entity4 and @entity5 have sparked a war of words in @entity9 , @entity10 but since then the gnomes have come under attack by unhappy locals and a group called the @entity17 saying they are in fact dwarves and not gnomes at all			1
@entity64 , who lives in @entity9 , said : ' the offending gnomes may be appropriate in @entity20 or in @entity66 but to claim that they enhance the image of @entity9 in any way is to insult the values of what @entity15 is supposed to stand for			1
donation : @entity41 of china firm @entity42 thought his gift of gnomes would be appreciated ‘ at a major entrance to the town we should be presenting visitors with that kind of image rather than these tacky things which some misguided souls believe reflect the spirit of the place			0
’ but @entity85 , of @entity15 , defended the move			2
she said : ' what ’s not to like ? blue gnomes are just a question of personal taste			0
' and someone describing themselves as @entity93 , secretary general of the @entity17 , wrote a letter to @entity9 in @entity95 , saying : ' it has come to our attention that the ornaments of cartoon @entity50 dwarves on the roundabout in @entity9 are being called gnomes			0
' we would like to explain that a dwarf is a small human , who is seen as having a disability due to the problem of having to fit into a larger - scale society			0
' a gnome is a non-human being that inhabits a different society , as do elves , pixies and fairies			0
' we would like you to desist from calling cartoon dwarves gnomes			0

drivers moan ' it 's @entity9 not @entity20 '
