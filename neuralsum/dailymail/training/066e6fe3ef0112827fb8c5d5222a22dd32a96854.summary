he said : ' all the offences involved a gross breach of trust			0
' the offences were persistent and amount , in my judgment , to a campaign of sexual offending			2
' @entity81 , prosecuting , said one of the 14 offences related to his time in @entity6 , with the remaining 13 committed while he was working in @entity8			0
the first offence took place in 1977 while @entity3 was teaching at @entity87 , in @entity88 , @entity6			1
' i was a vulnerable child when he came into my life , i already had been subjected to an extraordinary scale of brutality and abuse under the regime of @entity22			2
' i was an easy target for someone like @entity3 , a man who was in a position of responsibility and who was supposed to protect and educate children			1
' i can not relay how much this man manipulated me			0
i was left to feel everything was my fault , that something was wrong with me			0

' - victim of teacher @entity3 while there he took his victim to the @entity117 , where he groped him and took pictures			1

miss @entity128 said the boy had not liked what was happening to him and had asked to go home			0
she said the situation had been confusing for the victim as @entity3 had been nice to him during the day but every night was like ' a bad dream or nightmare '			1
@entity136 , defending , said @entity3 suffered from parkinson ’s disease and there was no evidence he had re-offended in the years following the offences			1

' senior investigating officer detective inspector @entity180 , of @entity181 , said : ' whilst the conviction and sentencing of @entity22 was a milestone in this investigation , other allegations have been received relating to @entity7			0
' it is just as important that we get justice for those other victims of abuse			2
' one of the offences committed by @entity3 happened almost 35 years ago , longer ago than the oldest of @entity22 ’s crimes			1
' this , along with the fact that @entity3 was living abroad and had become a @entity197 national , meant our inquiries were even more complex			1
' but today ’s result demonstrates that time and borders will not stand in the way of dealing with offenders who may think they have evaded the law			0
' i hope that the outcome of today ’s hearing is of comfort to those victims who now will not have to relive the traumatic experiences they went through at the hands of @entity211			0
