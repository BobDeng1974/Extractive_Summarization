@entity0 , the cricket bible , has launched a stinging attack on @entity4 cricket and says that the national team have lost touch with the game 's public			1
editor @entity9 , also a respected cricket writer with @entity10 , uses his notes to take @entity12 to task after a tumultuous year spent trying to recover from the bitter fall - out of losing the last @entity16 series 5 - 0			1
@entity4 cricket , says @entity9 in the 152nd edition of the fabled @entity18 , which is published on wednesday , ' repeatedly lost touch with the basic idea that the national team belongs to us all '			1
@entity0 editor @entity9 has launched a stinging attack on the @entity26 's handling of @entity27 the star batsman will ply his trade for @entity30 in a bid to reclaim his spot in the @entity34 team and he continues : ' a few wins might have deflected attention from a charge sheet that would include the mishandling of the @entity27 affair , worrying @entity34 attendances outside @entity41 , a head in the sand attitude to the one - day team and - not yet a decade after the 2005 @entity16 had presented @entity4 cricket with a golden chance to attract a new generation to the sport – a fall in the number of recreational players			1
' starting with the drubbing in @entity52 , @entity12 lost eight full series out of all across the formats in 2014 , to say nothing of their defeat by the @entity57 at the @entity58			1
in all , they lost 28 games			0
only once had this been surpassed in a calendar year by one of the eight major teams – the dysfunctional 2010 @entity62			0
' national selector @entity64 had called @entity66 " our exceptional leader " ; @entity69 , the @entity26 's new managing director , hailed @entity70 as the " outstanding coach of his generation "			2
it was a nexus of self - preservation yet , as the wagons circled , the wheels kept threatening to fall off			0
' the @entity0 editor is just as scathing about @entity12 's decision to sack @entity66 as one - day captain on the drink of what turned out to be the most disastrous @entity82 in @entity12 's history			1
@entity70 presided over a disastrous @entity82 but was labelled ' the outstanding coach of his generation ' by the @entity26 's new managing director @entity69 the beleaguered @entity66 was stripped of the one - day captaincy before the @entity82 debacle ' to leave the sacking of @entity66 so late made little sense , ' says @entity9			1
' had he stepped down in august after the 3 - 1 @entity89 win over @entity90 he could have done so with his post-ashes reputation partly restored			0
this would have allowed him to gather strength for the ludicrous run of 17 tests in less than 10 months , starting in @entity96 in @entity97 in april 2015 and ending in @entity98 in @entity99 in january 2016			0
( as someone pointed out , 17 @entity95 are almost a third of @entity103 's career			0
) ' @entity104 was , @entity66 had become more than just a cricketer : cast by his employers in the role of latter - day saint to @entity27 's fallen angel , he was now an article of faith			1
@entity112 ( the @entity26 chairman ) even suggested the @entity113 were " very much the sort of people we want the @entity12 captain and his family to be " which was all well and good but could n't stop him edging behind			2
@entity118 , @entity64 and @entity70 were all bound up with his fate			0
@entity66 had to succeed , as much for others as himself			2
it was an intolerable position			0
' @entity12 overplayed their hand			2
the test win over a supine @entity90 did not mean @entity66 would effect a similar transformation of the one - day side			1
this seemed obvious to everyone – except to the men who run the game			0
' but @entity9 , who also writes for @entity10 , says @entity66 's eventual sacking so late made little sense national selector @entity64 ( right ) had called @entity66 ' our exceptional leader ' @entity27 appeared on the @entity134 - the presenter suggested ' team sport 's not for you ' @entity12 also come under attack for the way they handled the sacking of @entity27 , a situation where they had right on their side - plus the support of the bulk of those who follow the team around professionally - but somehow allowed the maverick to claim the morale high ground			1
a situation that , incredibly , is still going on , after @entity0 went to press on this year 's edition			2
' the @entity26 's comments on the fall - out with @entity27 should have been clear and concise , ' writes @entity9			1
' if you 're widely regarded as a pain it helps if you 're scoring lots more runs than anyone else			0
instead , @entity12 botched the pr battle			2
they hinted that some darker truth about his behaviour would emerge once a confidentiality agreement expired in october			0
yet the lull merely prolonged the fiasco			0
and , when the dirt failed to materialise , the @entity26 looked rudderless			0
worse , in the eyes of those agitating for an explanation , they looked indifferent			0
' it was typical of a story beyond @entity26 's control that their best moment was not of their own making			0
having searched in vain for the words that justified his sacking , they were gifted a 324 - page solution , an autobiography so full of rancour that @entity187 chat - show host @entity185 suggested to @entity27 : " maybe , just maybe , team sport 's not for you			2
" this year 's @entity0 also includes both a withering review of @entity27 's nasty book by the @entity193 's @entity192 , who retired this year after a distinguished career , and an excellent piece of the aspect of his career totally overlooked by @entity27 in his book – batting that touched genius			1
@entity201 admirably fills the void that @entity27 left himself			0
@entity203 has been named one of @entity0 's five cricketers of the year in the new edition @entity209 's @entity208 team - mate @entity207 , called up by @entity12 , is also in the top five @entity210 ( left ) and @entity211 make up the remainder of @entity9 's top five cricketers @entity215 's brilliant @entity214 clinched the title of leading cricketer in the world @entity52 's @entity219 ( batting against @entity12 ) is honoured with the inaugural women 's award the thousands of disciples of @entity0 always look immediately at who the editor has chosen as his five cricketers of the year , one of the oldest and most highly regarded prizes in sport			1
@entity9 has chosen well and predictably in the cases of @entity230 , who has the honour of being pictured on the front cover , @entity203 , @entity207 and @entity211 and enterprisingly in @entity210 , who is rewarded for his prolific season for @entity234			1
to me , the award suffers in that players are only allowed to be picked once			0
for instance , how good would it be if , on his retirement , a player would be described as a five - time @entity0 cricketer of the year ? @entity9 is a progressive , brilliant , imaginative editor but perhaps such a move would be just a little too controversial for such a traditional vehicle as @entity0			1
the brilliant @entity214 , who will be delighting championship audiences with @entity30 this summer , is the leading cricketer in the world while , for the first time , there is an international woman cricketer of the year			1
@entity52 's @entity219 is honoured with the inaugural women 's award			1
as ever , @entity0 is a must for any cricket fan and even at a time of continuing turmoil for the @entity12 team and genuine concerns about cricket 's future world-wise , it is a reassuring presence however critical the editor is of it			1
@entity230 ( @entity12 and @entity263 ) @entity12 ’s search for a spin bowler to replace @entity266 was thought to be doomed – until @entity230 lit up the summer with 12 wickets in the @entity268 and @entity269 @entity95 against @entity90			2
he finished the series with 19 at 23 apiece			0
earlier in the season he had almost saved the @entity272 against @entity215 , batting for all bar one ball of the final day			2
and , when he was promoted to open for the one - day side , he scored the third - fastest hundred by an @entity12 batsman , from 72 balls against @entity215 in @entity279			1
@entity230 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity90 's @entity281 at @entity282 last summer @entity203 ( @entity12 and @entity208 ) @entity203 began the summer with a century in his first home test , against @entity215 at @entity284 , and followed up with two more against @entity90 – at @entity284 and @entity268			1
by the end of the season he boasted a @entity34 average of over 60			0
@entity203 celebrates reaching his century during the third test with @entity90 in @entity268 last year @entity207 ( @entity12 and @entity208 ) @entity208 opening batsman @entity207 was the leading run - scorer in the @entity290 , with 1,489 runs at an average of 67 and six hundreds , and was one of the pillars of his team ’s triumph			2
he was rewarded with a place on @entity12 ’s tour of the @entity299 in april 2015			0
@entity208 's @entity207 was the leading run - scorer in the 2014 @entity290 season @entity211 ( @entity215 ) @entity211 was the inspiration behind @entity215 ’s first @entity34 series victory in @entity12			1
after helping to save the @entity89 at @entity284 with a century , he made 160 – and took four wickets – as @entity215 came from behind to win in @entity305			0
@entity211 also led his team to wins in the one - day series and the one - off twenty20 international			2
@entity211 after making 160 for @entity215 in the second test with @entity12 at @entity311 @entity210 ( @entity312 and @entity234 ) @entity312 off - spinner @entity210 was central to @entity234 ’s success across all three formats			1
he claimed 107 victims in total , more than anyone in the country , and his 25 wickets in the @entity320 – the most in the competition – helped his side lift the trophy on home turf at @entity325			0
@entity210 takes the final wicket as @entity234 beat @entity327 in last year 's @entity290			0

@entity0 editor @entity9 launched an attack on @entity4 cricket
the @entity10 writer criticised their handling of the @entity27 affair
@entity9 was also scathing of @entity12 's late decision to sack @entity66 as one - day captain on the eve of the @entity82
