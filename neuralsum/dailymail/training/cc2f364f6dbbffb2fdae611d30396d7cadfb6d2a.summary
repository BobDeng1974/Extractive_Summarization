mr @entity11 handed @entity12 another 16 life sentences on top of the seven he is already serving			1
@entity14 , 42 , was found guilty of four rapes , 12 assaults by penetration and a single charge of wounding which took place between december 7 and 12 , 2005 , by a jury at @entity22			1
@entity14 , 42 , tied the woman to her bed , gagged her and repeatedly degraded with a knife and other objects during a 12 - hour assault			1
the woman was left so traumatised by the attack in december 2005 that she did not tell police until last year			1
@entity14 , who is known by his middle name of @entity2 , is already serving life imprisonment for the near - identical sex attack on @entity22 woman @entity35 in 2009			1
she gave up her anonymity in 2009 , when he was convicted of raping her			1
he was only free walking the streets because he had been released on licence from prison in 2003 after serving 16 years of a life sentence for the ritualistic murder of @entity43 , 67 , in @entity44 in 1987			1
jurors at @entity22 took around six hours to find @entity14 unanimously guilty			1
the judge said : ' @entity12 , you must appreciate that the nature of these offences , and the murder and rape convictions that went before them , may well result - and probably should result - in you remaining in custody for the remainder of your life			1
' @entity14 , who was surrounded by four dock officers , showed no emotion and stared straight ahead as the jury foreman returned all 17 verdicts			1
the woman , who can not be identified for legal reasons , sat in the upstairs public gallery of court room two to see the verdicts returned			2
sitting just a few feet away was mrs @entity35 , who has been present in the public gallery for the whole trial			0
during @entity14 ’s trial at @entity22 , jurors were told of ' peculiar hallmarks ' of his behaviour , which linked the murder and the 2009 rape to the offences for which he has now been convicted			1
prosecutors say it was ' beyond the realms of coincidence that a different man could have committed such similar offences in such a distinctive way '			0
scene : @entity14 was told at @entity22 that he would probably die behind bars @entity85 told the court that the woman was the victim of a ' brutal and prolonged sexual attack ' at the hands of @entity14			1
' she was repeatedly raped and otherwise violently assaulted over a period of hours whilst being held as a prisoner in her own home , ' the prosecutor said			1
' many of the incidents occurred at knifepoint or when she had been tied up			0
' mr @entity97 said the attack was ' devastating ' for the woman and she has been forced to give up her career and admitted to a psychiatric unit			2
three weeks before the attack , the woman and her housemate had been out drinking in the @entity105 area of @entity22 when they met a man called @entity2			1
the two women and the man chatted and the housemate told @entity2 that she would be away at a @entity112 party for a few days in early december			0
the alleged victim described in detail to @entity2 where she lived but the conversation turned sour later and she told him to ' f * * * off ' before leaving			0
on the night of the attack , the woman heard a white van pull up outside her house			2
justice : @entity35 who has campaigned for the man who brutally raped her to spend the rest of his life behind bars has said justice has now been done after he was told he will probably die in jail she then heard footsteps and suddenly a well - built man in a black balaclava came in through an unlocked door			2
' he pushed her backwards and she fell over on the kitchen floor			0
he knelt over her and banged her head against the tiled floor , ' mr @entity97 said			0
' he then grabbed her and dragged her backwards in the direction of the corridor saying ‘ you ca n’t say no now ’			0
' he let go of her and seemed to be looking around the house			0
he then dragged her into the bedroom , having gone past the bathroom , swearing and menacing ‘ you aint gon na say f * * * * * * no , you f * * * * * * bitch ’ and ‘ @entity146 ... you are going to be awake for this ’			0
' mr @entity97 said the woman tried to fight the man off but he pinned her down on the bedroom floor			0
he then told her to get up and pushed her on to the bed			0
the attacker removed his mask and as the woman remembered him from the pub three weeks earlier , he said : ' you recognise me now then ... you ’re going to suffer now			1
' the man took regular breaks between assaults to make cups of tea or watch television			0
@entity14 said to her : ' i ’m going to drink your blood and then you ’ll always be inside me			2
' mr @entity97 told jurors : ' he threatened to cut off her toe , finger or ear , saying he had chopped up a woman before			0
' he traced the knife down her front and said he had taken someone ’s eye out before			0
he told her that he would kill her slowly ... ' mr @entity97 explained that similarities between these allegations and @entity14 ’s previous convictions meant the victim was not making it up			2
' the prosecution say that these previous convictions and their relative timing demonstrate a clear pattern of repeated behaviour , ' he said			0
the woman first confided in a psychologist and finally gave a written statement to police in may 2011			0
she later picked @entity14 out at an identity parade			2
in a defence statement , @entity14 , who was living in @entity22 , denied ever meeting the woman or raping her			1
' he has suggested that she has imagined the attack as a result of her deteriorating health , ' mr @entity97 said			0
heavily - tattooed @entity14 offered no evidence as a defence to the allegations .			2

@entity12 was on licence after serving 16 years of life sentence for ' ritualistic ' murder in 1987
he is already serving life imprisonment for 2009 sex attack
