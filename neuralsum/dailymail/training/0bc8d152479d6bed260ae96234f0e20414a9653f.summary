the @entity5 rocket blasted off from a launch pad in the south - western coastal village of @entity16			2
science officials told cheering spectators minutes later that the rocket delivered an observational satellite into orbit			1
there was no immediate confirmation that the satellite was operating as intended			0
@entity1 's long - range rocket program , in contrast , has generated international fears that it is getting closer to developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the @entity63 @entity5 's success comes amid increased tension on the @entity66 over @entity1 's threat to explode its third nuclear device			1
@entity69 is angry over tough new international sanctions over its december 12 rocket launch and has accused its rivals of applying double standards toward the two @entity76 ' space programs			0
capturing the imagination : @entity5 gather round a television at @entity79 to watch the launch , which comes amid increased tension over @entity1 's threat to explode its third nuclear device anxious wait : the launch comes weeks after arch - rival @entity1 accomplished a similar feat to the surprise of the world third time lucky : @entity5 tried and failed to launch satellites in 2009 and 2010 , and more recent launch attempts were aborted at the last minute feeling their way : both koreas see the development of space programs as crucial hallmarks of their scientific prowess and national pride			1
they have both had high - profile failures before success @entity101 and @entity79 have called @entity1 's rocket launch a cover for a test of @entity69 's banned ballistic missile technology			0

@entity5 tried and failed to launch satellites in 2009 and 2010 , and more recent launch attempts were aborted at the last minute			1
the satellite launched by @entity79 is designed to analyse weather data , measure radiation in space , gauge distances on earth and test how effectively @entity5 - made devices installed on the satellite operate in space			0
rising tensions : @entity1 sparked fears it is getting closer to developing nuclear weapons after launching this long - range rocket to deliver a satellite into space for the first time last month fears spread : @entity5 protesters burn a mock rocket as police officers spray fire extinguishers during a rally in @entity79 denouncing @entity1 's rocket launch on december 12 @entity5 officials said it will help them develop more sophisticated satellites in the future			1
@entity63 experts have described the @entity1 's satellite as tumbling in space and said it does not appear to be functioning , though @entity69 has said it is working			2
the @entity5 rocket launched today had its first stage designed and built by @entity143 experts under a contract between the two governments			0
@entity1 built its rocket almost entirely on its own , @entity5 military experts said earlier this month after analysing debris retrieved from the @entity149 in december			2

no confirmation yet that observational satellite was working as intended
launch attempts to cement @entity5 as a technological powerhouse
comes as @entity1 sparks fears it is developing nuclear missiles
