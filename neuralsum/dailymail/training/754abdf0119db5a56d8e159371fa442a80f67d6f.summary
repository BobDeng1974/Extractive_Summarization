by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 04:52 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 01:48 est , 24 june 2013 after president @entity4 hilariously mixed up their names last week , there were hopes that @entity8 and @entity10 soul star @entity9 might have formed a lasting friendship			1
however , things are n’t going too well , according to @entity14 ’s chancellor , who revealed today that he has been approached by the other @entity9 to sing in a duet and play golf - but he ca n’t do either			1
it comes after president @entity4 repeatedly referred to @entity8 as ‘ @entity9 ’ - known in the @entity14 for little more than a one - off hit in the 1980s - during @entity21 meetings in @entity22 last week			1
he 's now asked me for a game of golf , but i ca n't play golf			1
so it 's not going very well , this new friendship			0
’ he added , speaking to the @entity34 : ‘ it 's nice to be on first - name terms with the @entity37 - even if he sometimes gets the name wrong			0
that 's the way i look at it			0
’ mr @entity9 had jetted into the second day of the @entity41 in @entity22 , determined to impress the world ’s most powerful leaders with his plan to get tough with global tax dodgers			0
but his pride suffered a major setback when the leader of the free world got him confused with @entity26 star @entity9 - who most famously sang the 1982 hit on the wings of @entity52			1
mr @entity4 called him ‘ @entity56 ’ three times , to the visible embarrassment of the chancellor			2
‘ it was obvious @entity9 did n’t like being called “ @entity9 ” , ’ a government source said last week			2
‘ why would he ? his name is @entity8			0
’ mistake : chancellor @entity8 ( pictured ) , speaking to the @entity34 , said it was ' nice to be on first - name terms with the @entity37 - even if he sometimes gets the name wrong ' confused : @entity10 president @entity4 later apologised to the chancellor for getting in a muddle about his name in fact the chancellor ’s real name is @entity69 but switched to @entity8 aged 13 as a ‘ small act of rebellion ’			1
last week the soul singer said he was delighted to get a name - check at the @entity41			1
and in a bizarre twist suggested singing a duet up with the chancellor			0
' he 's asked me for a duet , and sadly i ca n't sing			1
he 's now asked me for a game of golf , but i ca n't play golf			1
so it 's not going very well , this new friendship ' chancellor @entity8 @entity9 told @entity85 : ' i was really delighted , actually			2
i was really not aware that he was that much of a fan that he would call the chancellor @entity9			1
' tell the chancellor when i come over i will have to hook up with him and we will do a duet of on @entity90 , or something			0
' @entity9 's entry in online encyclopaedia @entity94 was tampered with by a mischievous user to reflect mr @entity4 's inadvertent appointment of the singer to the @entity98			1
after being edited , the entry read : ' @entity9 ( born march 9 , 1948 ) is an @entity10 funk and @entity26 musician , songwriter , lyricist , former lead singer of the band , @entity105 , and as of june 2013 , is the chancellor of the exchequer and @entity107			1
' joke : mr @entity9 has now seen the funny side of the president 's slip - up , which was the talk of @entity112 the bogus information remained online for under an hour before being erased			2
the name gaffe by mr @entity4 came despite mr @entity9 boasting of his close links with the @entity117			2
after delivering a 90 - minute presentation on global data - sharing plans to stop companies and individual ’s hiding their profits in tax havens , mr @entity9 was left deflated when mr @entity4 responded : ‘ thanks for that , @entity9			1
’ ' it 's nice to be on first - name terms with the @entity37 - even if he sometimes gets the name wrong			0
that 's the way i look at it ' chancellor @entity8 but the two men could not be more different			0
the chancellor is the son of sir @entity133 , 17th baronet of @entity135 and @entity136			0
by contrast the father of singer - songwriter @entity9 was @entity139 , a trumpet player who played with @entity141 and @entity142			2
he had a total of 12 children but died when @entity9 was just 13			0
in an attempt to make amends , mr @entity4 insisted that he did know mr @entity9 ’s name really			0
‘ i ’m sorry , man			0
i must have confused you with my favourite @entity26 singer , ’ he said .			0

@entity10 president called chancellor ' @entity9 ' during @entity21 meeting last week
@entity4 admitted confusion with 1980s @entity10 soul singer @entity9
@entity26 star delighted by name - check and suggests duet with chancellor
but @entity9 says he ca n't sing - and also turns down a game of golf
