by @entity0 @entity1 was the top goalscorer at the @entity2 but also showed he 's capable of a great save after helping an over eager pitch invader escape the clutches of security			1
the incident occurred during the @entity8 ’s unveiling at the @entity9 , having joined @entity10 for a reported fee of £ 60million			1
after freestyling during his presentation to the fans , one boy – who was dressed in a @entity14 shirt – ran on to the pitch and firmly hugged the @entity20 nation ’s poster boy			1
he was taken to the side of the pitch , where @entity1 started angrily protesting the pitch invader ’s innocence , resulting in him being allowed to escape scot - free			2
@entity1 then proceeded to give the star - struck boy a football he was previously freestyling with during his presentation			0
the lad then buried this underneath his shirt , celebrating with a massive smile and a hand aloft , before going back into the stands			0
he will hope to be allowed back into the @entity9 to see @entity1 play in a potentially terrifying forward line with @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , supported by @entity51			0
rescued : the new galactico objected to the force the security guards used to deal with the fan gift : the @entity8 took the fan from security and gave the boy the ball he was free - styling with on the pitch			0
