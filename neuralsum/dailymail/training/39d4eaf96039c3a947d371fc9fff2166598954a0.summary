@entity2 @entity1 by - election candidate @entity0 rejects claims that he has covered up his and his wife ’s £ 5 million property portfolio and £ 500,000 - a - year joint earnings to try to win the @entity1 seat			1
mr @entity0 presents himself as a ‘ father , local man , son of a secretary and small businessman and state primary school - educated ’ candidate			1
but that is not quite the whole story			0
opponent : @entity0 ( left ) and his @entity17 flat ( right ) , one of two £ 2million @entity19 homes he owns in fact , he and @entity22 wife @entity20 own not one , but two , £ 2 million homes in @entity19 and a £ 1 million country pile built by an 18th century slave - trader			1
their @entity1 ‘ home ’ is a rented house obtained when he was picked as a candidate six months ago			2
and his @entity31 omits to say he went to a £ 13,000 - a - year private secondary school			1
together with his director ’s job at @entity37 ’s auction house , it is just the type of posh @entity2 boy image @entity39 and co ca n’t shrug off			2
mr @entity0 , who looks even younger than his 32 years , sticks rigidly to his @entity43 autocue when asked about national issues			1
during our interview at a cafeteria in @entity48 , near @entity1 , he is finally stirred when i ask whether , in his keenness to come across as a regular guy , he has misled voters			0
to win the candidacy , he promised he would move his family lock , stock and barrel to @entity1			0
a 250 - mile round - trip to @entity58 if he becomes mp – quite a commute for a self - proclaimed family man with two young daughters			1
wealthy : the @entity58 home owned by @entity0 how many nights has the family actually spent in their @entity1 ‘ home ? ’ ‘ er , it has grown over time			1
’ he wo n’t say			0
his election leaflets are also silent about the couple ’s £ 2 million flat in @entity17 , @entity19			1
it went up in value by £ 300,000 last year , more than twice the average price of a home in @entity1			2
last october , the couple splashed out an extra £ 2.5 million on a house in fashionable @entity77 , @entity58 , less than a mile from @entity78 , which they plan to move into soon			1
on top of that they bought @entity83 i listed @entity84 in @entity85 for £ 1.1 million in 2009			2
mr @entity0 says he is ‘ almost sure ’ they will sell it and move to @entity1 if he becomes mp			1
it is to be hoped this interview is not the first mrs @entity90 , a top commercial lawyer whose professional name is @entity92 , eight years mr @entity0 ’s senior , has heard of that			1
despite appearances , he says he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth , and cites his education at 500 - year - old independent school @entity98 as proof			2
‘ there was no way my parents could afford to send me to private school			0
my grandma @entity104 paid the fees			0
’ then why no mention of any of it in his @entity2 cv ? what does he know about life on the breadline ? ‘ that ’s not fair			0
none of it was inherited or handed on a plate to us			0
my wife and i have both worked jolly hard , ’ he insists			0
‘ i do n’t need to have a disabled daughter to know what it ’s like			0
pile : mr @entity0 's third home is a @entity124 in @entity125 , pictured ‘ i do n’t need to have lost a child in @entity127 to meet somebody who has and have empathy and support them			1
’ he could easily have carried on enjoying ‘ earning money and having nice homes ’ but sacrificed it all in a bid to become an mp			0
come off it , he can afford to because his wife earns approaching half - a - million a year with @entity22 law firm @entity137 and can pay all the bills			0
‘ i ’m not going to apologise for that			0
i ’m proud of her , ’ mr @entity0 says .			2

@entity0 presents himself as a ' father , local man and small businessman '
in fact , he owns two £ 2m homes in @entity19 and a £ *1m* country pile
the country house was built by an 18th century slave - trader
