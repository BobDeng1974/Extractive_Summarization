foreign drivers have escaped £ 2.3 million in speeding fines since january last year , figures have revealed			1
nearly 23,300 speeding offences have been caught on camera in @entity5 and @entity6 , however police have been unable to pursue the drivers as their vehicles are not registered with the @entity10			1
it is feared the actual figures could be nearly double the amount as only half of police authorities supplied figures			2
foreign criminals : nearly 23,300 speeding offences have been caught on camera in @entity5 and @entity6 , however police have been unable to pursue the drivers as their vehicles are not registered with the @entity10 drivers of foreign vehicles do not have to register their cars with the @entity10 until it has been in the @entity23 for six months , however this is hard to police			1
as a result , a large number of drivers with unregistered cars are able to commit speeding offences without having to pay up , risking lives on the road			1
in @entity37 , one foreign motorist was caught travelling at 111mph on the @entity38 , while a camera on the @entity40 in @entity41 recorded a driver travelling at 109mph in a 50mph zone , a spokesman for road safety charity the @entity33 said			2
@entity44 recorded the highest number of offences with 3,580 drivers caught speeding			1
this was followed by @entity52 with 2,477 , @entity50 whose cameras registered 2,152 offences , @entity54 with 2,090 and @entity37 recorded 1,954 speeding offences committed by foreign drivers			1
one way to do it : police can physically stop a foreign registered vehicle which is breaking @entity23 law and charge an on the spot fine , but budget cuts see authorities rely on cameras on most roads the @entity58 area , covering 32 @entity68 boroughs , came in at sixth place with 1,586 offences taking place across the @entity68 area , with the worst offence recorded on the @entity74 , southbound , when a driver was caught travelling 98mph in a 50mph zone			1
@entity78 , @entity33 ’s director of policy and research , said : ‘ the high numbers of overseas speeders on our roads show how important it is that the @entity23 joins up with the rest of @entity86 to harmonise motoring offences and give the police extra powers to pursue dangerous drivers			1
‘ progress on this issue has been very slow and in the meantime thousands of drivers are avoiding fines and bans simply because their cars can not be easily traced			0
’ the figures were released following a freedom of information ( @entity99 ) request to police authorities in @entity5 and @entity6 by @entity33			1
although the @entity99 request was made to 40 police authorities across @entity5 and @entity6 , only 23 supplied results			1
those which did not reply included @entity106 and @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
in may , the @entity113 changed the basis of the @entity116 directive on cross border enforcement so that the @entity23 could no longer opt out			0
it covers mutual access to information to trace vehicle owners involved in eight road safety offences - speeding , seat belt use , driving through red traffic lights , drink driving , drug driving , helmet use , use of forbidden lanes and mobile phone use			2
detailed negotiations are now under way at @entity86 level to implement the changes but a date for the @entity23 has not been set , according to @entity33			0
@entity136 , head of technical policy for @entity33 , said a change in the law would not only tackle the problem of drivers of foreign vehicles escaping speeding fines but it would also act as a deterrent			2
hidden figures : it is thought the number of foreign drivers escaping fines is much higher than 23,295 as only 23 of 40 police authorities released their figures he said : ‘ we want to clamp down on people who are flouting our road safety laws knowing that they are not going to be traced			1
‘ we believe that most foreign drivers do drive sensibly but we want to clamp down on the tiny minority who are not			0
’ @entity159 , aa president , said : ‘ it is worrying that so many drivers from overseas feel that they can speed through the @entity23 with impunity			2
‘ police do have the powers to stop and sanction drivers of vehicles with foreign plates if they are breaking the law			0
‘ we would like to see some proactive targeting of these dangerous drivers			0
‘ the figures come as no surprise as we do n’t yet have cross border enforcement using the @entity116 nation ’s vehicle registers			0
‘ this may change if a revised directive succeeds in the @entity116 ( in 2015 ) - the @entity23 opted out of the previous one along with @entity178 and @entity179 but will be forced to take part in the next one			0
’ mr @entity159 said this would be ideal for the @entity23 as it would allow it to send speeding penalties to the @entity113 vehicle keepers			0
he said : ‘ of course , the police can physically stop a foreign registered vehicle which is breaking @entity23 law and charge an on the spot fine , but of course we now have fewer traffic police and place greater reliance on cameras			0
‘ the problem with cross border enforcement is it could become just a money - related system of fines which wo n’t in itself help road safety as licence endorsements are also needed to change attitudes			0

nearly 23,300 offences committed by overseas drivers since january 2013
number could be far greater as only 23 of 40 authorities released figures
@entity44 had highest number of drivers caught speeding with 3,580
