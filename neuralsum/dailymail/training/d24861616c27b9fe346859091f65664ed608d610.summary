by @entity0 and @entity1 it was the @entity3 project that captured the hearts of space enthusiasts the world over - could a team of scientists really re-gain control of a long - thought dead spacecraft ? in late may they wowed us all by making first contact - but now the project has , sadly , come to an end			1
tanks on the spacecraft that were once full of nitrogen gas , needed to fire the thrusters , appear to be empty			1
the team made first contact with the probe in late may and has now fired the thrusters on the vehicle , with a view to flying past the moon on 10 august @entity24 was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward @entity36 from a stable orbit point between our planet and the sun known as the lagrangian 1 , or @entity42			1
monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the interconnected sun - @entity36 system , which at its most turbulent can affect satellites around @entity36			2
in 1984 , it was given a new mission and called the @entity24			0
in september 1985 , it passed through the tail of @entity51 , making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a comet			2
it also went on to fly by @entity57 in march 1986			2
from 1991 until 1997 , when it was too far away for reliable communications , this satellite continued to investigate the sun. now it 's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to @entity36 in august			1
without thrusters , there is no way to push the 36 - year - old spacecraft , the @entity24 - 3 , or @entity24 , onto a trajectory to be captured back in @entity36 orbit			1
instead , @entity24 - 3 , which is otherwise in working order , will just fly by			1
' odds are , there is nothing we can do , ' @entity71 , a leader of the effort , said			0
' we think there is a chance that the @entity81 used as a pressurant for the monopropellant hydrazine propulsion system may have been depleted , ' the team announced on wednesday , dashing hopes the craft could still have a fruitful life ahead of it			0
it is believed it will now lose radio contact in around three months as it simply drifts further away from @entity36 ,			2
the initial burn , which took place a few days ago , involved 11 ‘ pulses ’ of the spacecraft ’s hydrazine thrusters			1
they also completed the first trajectory change for @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , with the goal of flying past the moon on 10 august and eventually entering orbit between @entity36 and the @entity100 this had the goal of increasing the ‘ spin ’ of the spacecraft from 19.16 revolutions per minute to about 19.75 , almost exactly what the original mission specifications called for			1
‘ in other words : bullseye , ’ one of the lead scientists , @entity71 , writes at @entity112			0
the team of scientists were given the go - ahead by @entity116 to crowd - fund the revival of the seemingly ' dead ' spacecraft earlier this year			1
contact was last made with the spacecraft , called @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , in the late 90s			2
as it approached our planet , scientists had a brief chance to communicate with the 36 - year - old probe in an attempt to bring it back to life - which they managed to do in late may			1
‘ the @entity130 is pleased to announce that our team has established two - way communication with the @entity24 spacecraft and has begun commanding it to perform specific functions , ’ said @entity71 at the time			1
first contact with @entity24 was achieved at the @entity137 in @entity138 , which is continuing to be used as a means to communicate with the probe			2
the achievement was a collaboration with a number of other organisations and people including the staff at @entity146 and a team at the @entity148 in @entity149			0
in april the @entity147 - made up of the groups @entity112 , @entity151 , and @entity152 - undertook a successful crowd funding project to raise £ 74,000 ( $ 125,000 ) to rescue the probe			1
@entity116 also officially endorsed the @entity156 - based project and signed a space act agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s - era craft			1
this is the first time @entity116 has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again			0
' we contacted the spacecraft after recreating hardware that was discarded by @entity116 decades ago using command language that was recreated from old documents that were sitting in former employees ' basements , ' @entity167 told @entity175			0
he also revealed how they intended to use the spacecraft for science again , and to involve citizens in it in a way not attempted before			0
‘ the intrepid @entity24 spacecraft was sent away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind extending its mission of discovery to study two comets , ’ said former @entity116 astronaut @entity183			0
‘ we have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through this creative effort to recapture the @entity24 spacecraft as it zips by the @entity36 this summer			0
’ in march , amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and find out its route , raising hopes that the mission could be revived			2
the mission 's original communication hardware no longer exists , so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware			1
once proving this was possible , the project is now using the @entity137 ( pictured ) in @entity138 to send commands to @entity24 launched in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward @entity36 , @entity24 - 3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981			2
with remaining fuel and functioning instruments , it then was redirected to observe two comets			0
following the end of that mission , the spacecraft continued in orbit around the sun. it is now making its closest approach to @entity36 in more than 30 years			0
the goal of the @entity130 is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a gravitationally stable point between @entity36 and the sun known as @entity227 1 ( @entity42 )			0
once safely back in orbit , the next step will be to return the spacecraft to operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed			0
@entity130 's close approach provided optimal conditions to attempt communication			0
@entity116 said it had shared technical data with the amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from @entity24			1
the mission ’s original communication hardware no longer exists , so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware			1
having done this , the project is using the @entity137 in @entity138 to send commands to @entity24			0
new data resulting from the project will be shared with the science community and the public , providing a unique tool for teaching students and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering			0
the data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36 - year old spacecraft .			2

@entity156 - based amateur group successfully fired thrusters on ' dead ' probe
the spacecraft was moved to fly past the moon on 10 august
believed to have now run out of fuel - after just one firing of its thrusters
set to be abandoned after lunar *flypast*
