while another @entity2 victory looks almost impossible , the man who has dominated @entity3 's centre - right for 19 years may hope to help it win enough support to keep the centre - left from winning a clear majority in both houses of parliament			1
the question mark that remains over the election is whether the current prime minister will run			0
so far current prime minister @entity39 has said he will step in only if the election result is unclear , but there has been speculation he could join forces with a centrist group			0

it 's not possible to go on like this , ' @entity2 said after explaining that he had been ' besieged by requests from ( his ) party to announce at the soonest my re-entry into politics to guide the @entity21			0
' @entity2 's comeback arrives slightly more than a year after he resigned as prime minister as collapsing market confidence pushed @entity3 's debt costs to critical levels			1
his international reputation had already been left in tatters by lurid stories of ‘ bunga bunga ’ parties with pole - dancing prostitutes at his home outside @entity88			2
he is currently appealing a four - year jail sentence for tax fraud and faces a trial over paying for sex with an underage nightclub dancer			1
@entity3 will probably vote in march with a recession that began mid-way through last year showing no signs of abating and unemployment at 11.1 percent , a record high			1
‘ i race to win , ’ @entity2 told reporters at the practice field for @entity88 , the soccer club he controls , after repeating criticism of @entity39 's handling of the economy over the past year			2

it 's not that we did not look for one			0
we did , and how ! but there is n't one ... i 'm doing it out of a sense of responsibility			0
’ his move may unsettle financial markets , whose loss of faith in @entity2 's guidance of the economy pushed the country to the edge of a @entity128 - style debt crisis last year and prompted president @entity129 to ask the former @entity131 commissioner @entity39 to step in to restore confidence			1
with the support of a right - left coalition including the @entity21 , @entity39 imposed austerity measures to bring borrowing costs under control , but @entity2 said on wednesday that the economic professor 's policies had left @entity3 facing a ‘ recessive spiral without end ’			1

criticised : @entity2 has argued that current @entity3 prime minister @entity39 's handling of the economy has been particularly harsh though the euro zone 's third - biggest economy is still struggling , @entity39 has calmed the financial markets and the spread between @entity3 and @entity147 benchmark bonds this week fell to nearly half the level it was when he took over			1
@entity39 , who is a life - appointed senator , says he will not stand in next year 's vote , but is willing to step in afterward if the result is not clear			1
the tone of @entity2 's statement echoed comments made and broadcast on his @entity175 television network when he entered politics in 1994 , saying he would ' take the field ' to save the country from communism			0
in recent months , @entity2 's hesitation to say whether or not he would run in parliamentary elections has left the centre - right in disarray just as its centre - left rivals picked their candidate , @entity22 ( @entity22 ) leader @entity24 , in a primary vote on sunday			1
