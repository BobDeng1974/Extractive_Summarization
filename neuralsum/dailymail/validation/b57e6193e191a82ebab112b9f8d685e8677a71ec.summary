a judge is considering whether 50 pounds of potatoes and a produce box can be used as evidence in the trial of a man accused of killing six - year - old @entity6 in @entity7 in 1979			1
the suspect , @entity8 , told authorities that he choked @entity10 in the basement of the convenience store where he worked after luring the boy down the stairs with a promise of a soda			1
he told investigators he put the boy 's body in a plastic garbage bag , then put the bag inside a banana box and walked it about a block and a half away and put it down in an alcove with other trash			1
the body was never recovered			0
part of @entity8 's job at the store was to lug boxes of produce , soda and beer up and down the basement stairs into the shop in @entity38			1
bizarre request : the defense for @entity8 ( pictured in court in november 2012 ) have asked to use 50lbs of potatoes in court to show he would not have been able to life @entity6 's body as he claimed ' i put it on my shoulder			1
i walked to the right , ' he said of the box during his videotaped confession			0
' i was strong at the time			0
' victim : @entity6 was just six when he vanished while walking to his school bus in @entity7 in 1979 but attorneys for @entity8 , now 54 , say the confession was made up and @entity8 is mentally ill. attorney @entity57 suggests @entity8 was scrawny , weighing only about 115 pounds , and could not have carried a heavy box that far			1
he is asking to bring in the 50 pounds of potatoes and the produce box for jurors to demonstrate the weight of the body			1
on the missing - child poster , @entity10 's weight was listed as 50 pounds			1
but prosecutors say the measurement was a mistake made by frantic parents , and medical records from just a few months before @entity10 vanished have the boy weighing about 37 pounds			1
his mother , @entity72 , testified that he was very small for his age			0
assistant district attorney @entity74 argued that the method for showing how heavy the box would be is unscientific and should not be shown to jurors because it would be wrong			0
' it is incompetent evidence and unscientific because carrying a body is vastly different than potatoes , ' she said			2
it would be the second piece of unconventional evidence on whether the confession is plausible			0
earlier in the trial , prosecutors showed jurors a photo of a little boy crouching in a produce box , intending to show that @entity10 's body would have fit into such a box			1
the boy is @entity10 's size and shape but is n't identified			2
defense attorney @entity96 argued that the photos were equally as unscientific			0
' the people have been given free reign , ' she said			0
' we need to be allowed to introduce ' the box			0
in court : @entity8 's family leave court in his trial earlier this month			2
his daughter @entity105 , left , testified earlier this week about the negative effect her father 's arrest has had on her seeking justice : @entity110 , @entity10 's father , and his daughter @entity112 , left , arrive in court on march 9 the judge said he would decide on thursday			2
@entity8 made the surprising confession in 2012 to authorities who were interviewing him based on a tip from a relative			0
no physical evidence has been recovered , but at least five people have testified that over the years , @entity8 said he had killed a child in @entity123			0
he moved from @entity38 , where he had been staying with his sister and brother - in - law shortly after @entity10 disappeared , to @entity126 , where he has been living ever since , most recently in @entity127			1
@entity10 's parents helped galvanize the national missing - children 's movement			2
may 25 , the day he disappeared , is @entity132 .			0

suspect @entity8 *previously* told authorities he put the boy 's body in a banana box and carried it on his shoulder before *dumping* it
his defense team , who say he *falsely* confessed to the 1979 *murder* because he is mentally ill , want to show that his claims are not possible
they are asking a judge if they can enter 50lbs of potatoes - the weight @entity10 was said to be when he disappeared - and a produce box as evidence
@entity6 , six , vanished while walking to the school bus alone for the first time and his body has never been found
