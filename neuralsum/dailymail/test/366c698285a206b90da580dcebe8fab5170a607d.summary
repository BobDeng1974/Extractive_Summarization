@entity0 has branded @entity2 's £ 1.5million offer to fight @entity3 as little more than a ' publicity stunt '			1
@entity2 made the offer live on television on tuesday after talks between him and @entity0 ’s promoter @entity8 had stalled			1
but @entity11 's @entity10 super-bantamweight world champion has called on the @entity13 chief to make him a more realistic offer			1
super-bantamweight world champion @entity0 ( left ) has dismissed a fight offer from @entity3 @entity3 ( right ) offered £ 1.5m to @entity0 for a @entity17 super-fight , via his promoter @entity2 ' it ’s the biggest publicity stunt i ’ve seen since that incident between @entity22 and @entity23 at @entity24 ( when @entity23 's breast was briefly exposed by @entity22 ) , ' @entity0 wrote in his news letter column			1
' [ it ] is undoubtedly a lot of money			0
but does that mean i should snap it up with both hands ? ' absolutely not , and there are a number of reasons why			0
' it ’s a flat rate offer , which means that no matter how well this fight does at the box office , this is the most i ’ll receive			2
' if pay - per - view targets are reached this fight can bring in £ 10million and potentially as much as £ 12m			0
' so please , the next time you make an offer , make it a realistic one			0
' @entity3 showed off a £ 1.5m cheque ready to hand to @entity0 on @entity44 earlier this week but @entity0 has branded the gesture a ' publicity stunt ' and ridiculed the offer @entity2 was quick to respond on @entity48 , saying : ' [ the ] fact is we are putting offers on the table and you are n't ! if the offer is that bad then make us one ? ' also , if it makes as much money as you stated in your link , why have you also turned down 60 - 40 for the winner ? ' @entity2 has earmarked july 18 at the @entity60 for the world title unification clash with @entity62 and @entity64 alternative opponents for @entity3 .			2
