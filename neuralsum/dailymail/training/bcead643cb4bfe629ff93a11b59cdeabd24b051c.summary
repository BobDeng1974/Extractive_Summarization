by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 21:08 est , 20 november 2013 a proposed ‘ amnesty ’ for those suspected of scores of unsolved murders during the @entity6 provoked a furious backlash last night			1
relatives of those killed in the 30 - year conflict reacted furiously to a call to halt further inquests and other state investigations into the crimes committed before the 1998 good friday peace agreement was signed			1
@entity15 , the attorney general in @entity16 , insisted his proposals did not amount to an amnesty			1
but he said he felt the time had come to halt prosecutions			2
no prosecutions : killings carried out during the @entity6 should no longer be investigated , the @entity16 attorney general has said			1
here @entity25 soldiers examine an armoured @entity26 which was damaged during a grenade attack in 1997 yesterday @entity28 , whose 12 - year - old son @entity29 was killed when the @entity30 bombed @entity31 20 years ago , said mr @entity33 ’s call was ‘ highly insensitive ’			1
‘ the problem for me , and i guess for the vast majority of victims who have never had anybody prosecuted or arrested for the offence they committed , is that they will feel – as i do – that they have been forgotten and abandoned and the matter is just being filed away , ’ mr @entity28 , 66 , told @entity34			1
‘ if by chance some evidence were to pop out of the ether at some point in the future , or somebody was to provide some inside information anonymously , the prospect of there being an investigation and an arrest and possible prosecution would exist , whereas if the attorney general ’s proposition is supported and applied then that would not be possible			0
’ @entity60 , whose father @entity61 was killed in the 1987 @entity63 bombing in @entity64 , @entity65 , said he was disgusted			0
‘ how dare he airbrush the innocent people who were murdered at the hands of terrorists to move things forward , ’ he said			2
@entity71 , whose brother @entity72 was killed by soldiers on @entity74 in @entity75 in 1972 , called mr @entity33 ’s proposal ridiculous			1
murdered : @entity77 , nine , ( left ) and @entity78 , twelve , ( right ) conflict : riots in @entity81 following the death of @entity30 hunger striker @entity83 in 1981			2
the announcement that deaths prior to 1998 will not be investigated has sparked anger the police are currently re-investigating @entity74 , with relatives of those killed having long campaigned for the soldiers allegedly involved to be prosecuted			2
the 1998 @entity92 bomb , which happened after the @entity93 was signed , would not be covered by mr @entity33 ’s suggestion			1
he told the @entity34 : ‘ more than 15 years have passed since the @entity93 , there have been very few prosecutions , and every competent criminal lawyer will tell you the prospects of conviction diminish , perhaps exponentially , with each passing year , so we are in a position now where i think we have to take stock			2
unrest : @entity25 soldiers in @entity16 in the aftermath of @entity74 reaction : former @entity16 secretary of state @entity107 described the proposals as ' commonsense ' ‘ it strikes me that the time has come to think about putting a line , set at good friday 1998 , with respect to prosecutions , inquests and other inquiries			1
’ he said crimes of the past would remain crimes but ‘ it would simply be that no criminal proceedings would be possible ’ with respect to them			2
@entity123 , whose son @entity124 was killed in the august 1998 @entity30 attack in @entity92 , which claimed 29 lives , said the attorney general was sending out a totally wrong message to terrorists			0
dissident republicans have murdered two soldiers , two policemen and a prison officer in the last five years			0
‘ he is saying , “ if you murder enough people , the government will make a deal with you and you will eventually get off ” , ’ said mr @entity123			1
ruling out an amnesty , @entity139 told the @entity141 it would be ‘ rather dangerous ’ to block possible future prosecutions			1
former @entity145 diplomat dr @entity144 is trying to achieve political consensus on a number of issues as yet unresolved during the peace process – one of which is how the province addresses the legacy of its violent past and the seemingly endless unanswered questions over killings carried out by all sides			0
mr @entity33 outlined his controversial proposals in a submission to dr @entity144			1
the @entity161 ( bloody monday ) in 1972 the @entity30 exploded three car bombs in quick succession in the main street of @entity166 , a village in @entity75 , killing nine			0
among the dead was nine - year - old @entity77			1
she had been playing outside her family ’s shop			0
@entity171 on @entity172 in east @entity81 loyalists with murky links to the security forces killed six civilians in 1975 , including a young mother of 11 and pensioners , and gravely injured dozens more			0
two killers fired shots through a window before hurling a bomb inside			0
@entity185 / @entity184 men were shot dead in 1976 in their rural homes in @entity187 , reportedly by members of the security forces operating under the guise of the loyalist @entity171			0
all the victims were exonerated of involvement in terrorism			0
the @entity30 retaliated the next day with the … @entity194 up to a dozen heavily armed @entity30 men from @entity187 stopped a minibus of textile factory workers and murdered 11 @entity198 on it			0
@entity201 bomb exploded without warning during a @entity203 service at @entity64 in @entity65 in 1987 , killing 11			0
at least 63 were injured .			0

more than *3,500* people died in the 30 - year conflict in @entity16
@entity15 has called for an end to ' prosecutions , inquests and other inquiries ' into deaths before the 1998 good friday agreement
mr @entity33 said this would not amount to an amnesty - the pre- 1998 offences would still be crimes but they would no longer be prosecuted
@entity139 says the government has no plans to end prosecutions
family of murder victims *condemn* the proposals
already a *maximum* two - year sentence for all killings during the @entity6
