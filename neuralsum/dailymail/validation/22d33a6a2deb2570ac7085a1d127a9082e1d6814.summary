@entity0 realised his boxing - in - the - kitchen video might not be quite so easy to shrug off when @entity4 caught five - year - old @entity5 mimicking his father ’s knockout goal celebration			1
‘ my wife went to pick him up from school and saw him doing that in the classroom , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’m sure you wo n’t be seeing that celebration again			2
’ there will be no repeat if the @entity18 captain hits the target in a @entity21 qualifier against @entity22 at @entity23 on friday and moves ever closer to sir @entity25 ’s goal record			1
@entity0 says he wo n't repeat his knockout celebration if he scores for @entity18 against @entity22 @entity0 produced the celebration after scoring in @entity29 's 3 - 0 win over @entity30 on march 15 the 29 - year - old 's celebration was in jest to him being floored by by @entity35 defender @entity34 at home @entity0 prepares to fall to the floor in reference to the leaked video of the impromptu bout at his family home @entity43 ( right ) laughs as @entity0 falls as part of his humorous boxing celebration at @entity46 how @entity47 stands ahead of friday 's matches @entity0 celebrated scoring for @entity29 against @entity30 earlier this month by falling flat on to his back , a joke aimed at a film of him being floored by @entity35 defender @entity34 during an impromptu bout at his home which has since proved the source of much amusement for team - mates			1
‘ there has been a bit around the place , at @entity29 and @entity18 training , but you ’d expect that , they ’re a group of lads , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve always loved boxing			2
unfortunately , sometimes it does n’t go too well			2
i was caught on the end of a punch			2
i was n’t knocked out			0
‘ i did n’t see it as a big issue			0
i spoke to the manager , and he did n’t see it as a big issue			0
i come from a boxing background			0
i ’d have apologised if i felt it was wrong			0
but for me , that ’s been and gone			0
’ what if he had fallen badly , someone asked			0
‘ i never , so … ’ shrugged @entity0 and flashed a smile			1
@entity80 , seated beside him , smiled too , not about to chastise his skipper , a player who will win his 102nd @entity18 cap on friday			1
only eight players have more			0
as for his pursuit of the goal record , he is only two behind @entity86 , three behind @entity87 ’s 49 and in splendid form for his country			2
‘ @entity25 ’s been a great for @entity29 and @entity18 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i speak to him regularly at the club , especially after games			0
he gives me great advice , certainly when i was playing midfield because he was an attacking midfielder and he spoke to me about my role			0
@entity0 ( right ) will be hoping to close in on sir @entity25 's @entity18 goalscoring record on friday @entity0 currently has 46 goals in 101 appearances for @entity18 - just three shy of @entity87 's tally expected line - ups for friday 's @entity21 qualifier ‘ but i do n’t want to bring it up with him and say i ’m close to beating him			1
hopefully one day it will happen , sooner rather than later			0
’ @entity107 ’s experiment with @entity0 in midfield seems to be over , brought to an end when @entity110 was injured and the @entity29 manager ran out of patience with @entity113			1
‘ we ’re delighted to see him up front again for @entity29			0
we ’ve always used him as a front player , ’ said @entity80 , and @entity0 seemed to agree he was back in his natural position while trying not to say anything that might offend @entity116			1
‘ i ’m delighted to be up front , scoring goals and helping us win , ’ said the 29 - year - old , who has four in five for @entity29 since @entity124 ’s injury and six in six up front for @entity18 this season , including two on his last outing , the friendly in @entity129 in november			1
since then , @entity131 has exploded into contention with a blaze of goals			2
@entity131 has 29 for the season and @entity80 chatted on thursday with @entity30 boss @entity136 , who watched @entity18 work at the @entity30 training ground , near @entity139			1
‘ he is in sizzling form , ’ said @entity0 , who made his @entity18 debut at 17 and urged supporters to be gentle with the 21 - year - old if he makes his debut in front of tonight ’s sell - out crowd			1
‘ give him room to breathe , rather than smothering him and demanding a lot off him at an early age when he has n’t played for @entity18 yet			1
he is still in his first season in the @entity152			0
let him continue doing what he ’s doing			0
that ’s the way to get the best out of him			0
’ @entity0 believes @entity131 ( left ) should be allowed room to develop as a player for @entity18 @entity131 is in the @entity18 squad for the first - time in his career after a dazzling season at @entity30 @entity162 pulled out of the squad earlier this week with an injury described by @entity80 on thursday as a ‘ small tear ’ in a thigh muscle which he ‘ could n’t play though ’			1
the @entity18 manager was keen to stress , however , that he considered @entity168 to be among his options up front			2
@entity168 is expected to start and be released after this game , spared tuesday ’s friendly in @entity172 because he has been nursing a toe injury			0
@entity174 is carrying a knee problem and is also unlikely to play in both games			0
@entity177 could be called in			0
@entity80 ’s priority is the competitive fixture , with @entity18 expected to win comfortably and extend their 100 per cent record in qualifying @entity47 against a team ranked 94th in the world			2
this will count against @entity131 ’s chances of starting , as will @entity80 ’s desire to have a genuine striker on the bench , to introduce and lift spirits if all does not go to plan against @entity22 , who will probably operate with limited ambition at @entity23			2
if it comes down to a straight fight between @entity195 and @entity131 for the right to partner @entity0 , the @entity18 captain could always reach for the boxing gloves and lead them to the kitchen			1
@entity199 star @entity168 is expected to start for the @entity18 at @entity23 on friday night			1

@entity0 has scored 46 goals in 101 appearances for @entity18 so far
sir @entity25 is @entity18 's all - time top goalscorer with 49
