a row over a seven - year - old 's smart haircut has become so heated that his parents have threatened to remove him from school			2
@entity5 , a pupil at @entity7 's @entity6 in @entity8 , upset the authorities by getting his hair styled with short sides and a combover - a style that was n't uncommon in the much stricter schools of the 1950s			1
he has been threatened with increasingly severe ' behaviour sanctions ' if the style is not changed - even though the cut does not obviously breach any school rules			1
smart : seven - year - old @entity5 , left , has been told off for his haircut at school - despite it being seen on schoolboys as far back as the 1950s , right ' not clear ' : @entity5 's parents , @entity23 and @entity24 , say they do not understand why the cut is unacceptable according to @entity7 's guidelines , tramlines , mohicans and gel are banned - along with anything deemed ' distracting '			1
@entity31 , the headteacher of @entity7 's , threatened to drag the @entity5 family into a meeting with the chair of the school governors over the controversial cut			2
but @entity5 's parents - beautician @entity24 , 28 , and father @entity23 - insist the style is ' just a normal haircut '			1
ms @entity39 said : ' mrs @entity31 is saying his hair does n’t comply with policy			0
but i do n’t understand why and we ’re not cutting it			0
' it ’s becoming so bad i ’m thinking of taking him out			0
' celeb lookalike ? the combover style has also gained celebrity followers recently , including @entity51 star @entity50 , pictured right last year rules : @entity7 's @entity6 in @entity8 has regulations against many hair styles mr @entity5 added : ' they are saying it needs to be the same length all over , but that ’s a bowl cut and we ’re not doing that			1
' it is our decision how @entity5 has his hair , we are his parents , so it is unfair to keep picking on him			0
' mrs @entity31 said : ' @entity5 is a lovely little boy who is liked by all the staff and who always wants to do his best			0
' our uniform and appearance policy - which is linked to our behaviour policy - provides parents with clear guidelines on what is acceptable in terms of hair styles and what is n't			2
' rules are applied fairly and consistently throughout the school and are not bent for individual children			0

@entity5 's style was n't uncommon in stricter days of 1950s schooling
