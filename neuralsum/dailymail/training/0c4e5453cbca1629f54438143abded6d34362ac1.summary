by @entity0 a lonely police worker who became addicted to @entity3 for her back pain died after taking a cocktail of illegal drugs			1
@entity8 , 36 , became so hooked on the over-the - counter tablets that she tried to kick her habit by urging local chemists not to sell them to her , an inquest heard			1
but the communications officer became depressed that she was single and working unsociable hours while friends were settling down and starting families , and began travelling to nearby towns to buy the pills , her mother revealed			1
@entity8 , seen here on the left enjoying a night out with friends , started taking @entity3 for back pain after falling down some stairs but soon became addicted to it miss @entity26 was eventually admitted to hospital after taking 32 of the tablets , which can become addictive because they contain codeine as well as ibuprofen			1
she recovered , but just days later she inexplicably took a fatal overdose of cocaine , amphetamines and @entity35 , the inquest heard			1
she had begun taking painkillers for migraines in her teens , the hearing was told , and was badly affected by the loss of her father in a road accident in 2001			2
toxicology tests showed miss @entity26 had large amounts of cocaine in her system and had also taken amphetamines and ecstasy her troubles with @entity3 began after the breakdown of a relationship in 2005 and a fall down stairs in 2010 , after which she required surgery on fractured vertebrae			1
her mother , @entity55 , told the hearing she had lost friends because of the unsociable hours she worked in her job with @entity59			1
‘ that was half her problem – a lot of her friends were married with children and she found it very difficult with the work pattern she had to go out with friends , ’ she said			2
‘ she was very lonely			2
she complained of back pain quite often			2
’ on november 21 last year one of her daughter ’s colleagues called her to say miss @entity26 was ‘ unsteady on her feet and did n’t appear herself ’			2
mrs @entity55 said : ‘ she looked like she was drunk			2
she was slurring her words			0
she said she had n’t taken any tablets but from her demeanour it was obvious			0
’ an empty 32 - pill packet of @entity3 was found in miss @entity26 ’s bag			1
she was admitted to hospital , where she was diagnosed with a kidney problem and told to stop taking ibuprofen			0
mrs @entity55 said her daughter seemed ‘ happy ’ when she saw her on november 27			0
but three days later she failed to respond to an invitation to sunday lunch and her body was found at her @entity84 home			0
her sister @entity85 told the inquest how , in the run - up to the tragedy , she had told her sister to ‘ sort herself out ’ as the pair argued by text message			0
miss @entity26 was so addicted to @entity3 that she asked her local chemists to stop selling them to her ‘ she had told the chemist in the past when she had wanted to stop [ taking @entity3 ] not to serve her , ’ she said			1
‘ when she went back to taking it that ’s when she would travel because everyone locally knew not to sell it			0
’ according to miss @entity26 ’s family , she used to take both @entity3 – which only contains ibuprofen – and @entity3			1
toxicology tests showed that she had not taken @entity3 on the day of her death but that there were fatal levels of cocaine , and she had taken amphetamines and @entity35			1
many popular pills taken for headaches , sore backs , migraines and period pain contain codeine , a powerful painkiller from the same family of drugs as heroin and morphine			0
it makes people feel relaxed , so even if the pain has gone , some people will keep taking it for the calming effect – leading them to become addicted			0
it is available without prescription in low doses and can be combined with paracetamol or ibuprofen – as in nurofen plus			0
side - effects of codeine range from drowsiness and dizziness to fits and heart rhythm problems			2
with 25million packs of painkillers containing codeine sold over the counter each year in the @entity144 , it is feared that tens of thousands of people could be addicted to tablets such as @entity3 , @entity147 , @entity148 and other tablets available without prescription			1
young , female professionals are believed to be particularly vulnerable			0
packs are limited to 32 tablets , contain warnings about addiction and can only be sold under the supervision of a pharmacist			0
@entity157 , the second ingredient in @entity3 , is also not without risk			1
side - effects include indigestion , stomach ulcers and an increased risk of stroke and heart attack			0
it should not be taken by anyone with kidney problems			2
the family were unaware she was using illegal drugs as well			0
coroner @entity171 recorded that her death was as a result of drug misuse but said mystery surrounded how she had obtained illicit drugs			0
recording a narrative verdict at the hearing in @entity84 , he said : ‘ she found relief in pain by taking @entity3 , it is available over the counter and she became quite addicted			1
‘ it ’s sad that she felt the need to take these illicit drugs			0
’ @entity189 guidelines and information on packets advise against taking @entity3 for more than three days in a row as the codeine makes it addictive .			1

@entity8 had cocaine , amphetamines and ecstasy in her system
her @entity3 problems began after a break up in 2005 and a fall in 2010
and her unsociable work hours left her feeling *isolated* and ' very lonely '
