he met @entity166 while in jail , and the three soon formed into a terrorist cell which was able to get hold of automatic rifles and other weapons with relative ease			0
despite their criminal convictions and clear links to @entity177 and other terrorist groups such as @entity179 , they were given free rein to strike			0
@entity181 , a police trade union leader , said : ' somewhere along the line the suspects fell through the cracks			0
