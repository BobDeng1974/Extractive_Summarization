it is perhaps the greatest of stately homes , the sprawling @entity4 estate that was setting for the television series adaptation of @entity6			1
and now the breathtaking spectacle of @entity8 is again the setting for the turbulent drama of an ancient aristocratic family			2
the @entity12 has learned that @entity13 , who has run the 18th century home for 30 years and lived in it his whole life , is set to leave the 10,000 - acre estate along with his wife @entity18 – and @entity13 's elder brother @entity20 and his wife @entity21 have indicated to @entity13 that they intend to move in			1
at the time @entity13 , 58 , was being treated for throat cancer , although he has recently been told he is clear of the disease			1
it is understood that staff at the @entity4 ancestral seat will be told tomorrow of the changes , and @entity13 and @entity18 are said to be ' in shock ' and ' devastated '			1
a friend of the couple said : ' it is beyond belief			0
@entity13 was a wreck of a man when he heard			2
' his heart is ripped apart			0
the house is his whole life			0
' @entity48 and his wife @entity21 have said they intend to move in to the sprawling estate another friend close to the family expressed her outrage over the move , especially after the success that @entity13 has found in running the estate , which attracts a quarter of a million visitors a year			1
the friend said : ' @entity13 has run a very tight ship			2
the house has been his lifeblood			0
' @entity18 has been an incredible chatelaine			2
she has run the place amazingly inside and out			0
she adores the place because she has always been into history			0
' the timing of this has been deeply upsetting for the family			0
' @entity8 , which was designed by sir @entity70 and built between 1699 and 1712 , has been home to ten generations of the @entity13 family			1
spreading out over 145 rooms , the house is considered one of @entity70 's greatest achievements			0
its magnificent art collection includes ancient sculptures , @entity81 and works by @entity83 and @entity84			0
the house and estate is owned by @entity87 , of which @entity13 , who is chairman and managing director , and his elder brother @entity20 , 62 , are each 50 per cent shareholders			1
in february , @entity27 , 60 , who was the chief executive officer of @entity93 publishing giant @entity92 until she stepped down in august 2013 , also joined the @entity8 board , but @entity18 has never been elevated to such a position of control , despite helping to run the household			1
the iconic estate was the setting for the tv series @entity6 starring ( l - r ) @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 exactly what has happened behind the scenes to bring about the switch at @entity8 was not clear last night , although friends said @entity18 , 47 , herself a scion of the @entity111 family who founded @entity112 , feels badly treated			1
one said : ' @entity18 felt that if there was a position on the board of directors that naturally , as @entity13 's wife and the chatelaine of the house , she would be accepted immediately on to the board			1
' however , this was rejected			0
i do n't know the ins and outs of this but i think @entity13 felt very pushed into a corner			2
' i know that @entity18 was deeply hurt and upset and could n't really understand what was going on			2
' according to another friend , the addition of @entity27 to the board , whose directors include @entity20 's 28 - year - old son @entity131 , meant that @entity13 feared he could be voted out because of his health issues , and he felt he had little option but to give up the running of the estate , although he is to remain a director of the company			1
@entity8 , which was designed by sir @entity70 and built between 1699 and 1712 , has been home to ten generations of the @entity13 family spreading out over 145 rooms , the house is considered one of @entity70 's greatest achievements there is strong speculation that he , @entity18 and their 12 - year - old twins , @entity150 and @entity151 , who are educated locally , will move out of the house , where they occupy one of the wings			1
one friend said that @entity13 and @entity18 had been told that one likely consequence of the ' putsch ' is that @entity20 and @entity27 will move into @entity8			1
@entity13 , the former @entity159 , has been waging a battle with throat cancer for much of this year , but a medical scan last week found he was free of the disease			1
in august , he said : ' a lump was removed from my throat and it was found to have cancerous squamous cells			0
it was a bit of a shock at the time , but it was removed successfully and i have just completed a precautionary seven - week course of radiation therapy			2
' as things stand , i have been very lucky and i am in the clear			0
' according to a family friend , the latest development will cast a shadow over the festive preparations at the estate , where an elegant row of illuminated @entity180 trees already line the driveway			0
' that is what is really sad about this situation , ' said the friend			0
' the brothers have not always seen eye to eye			0
@entity18 has been hosting these wonderful @entity180 and family gatherings where everyone has been included and she has healed rifts over the years			2
she bends over backwards to be hospitable			0
' @entity48 has made his reputation as a @entity93 - based photographer , with a home in the fashionable @entity195 district			0
he has photographed top artists such as @entity197 and @entity198 and his pictures of @entity8 were exhibited at the house in 2008			2

@entity18 has recently taken to spending a few days each week away from @entity8 at a rented house on a neighbour 's estate , which @entity13 also visits			1
the @entity249 say that with 250,000 visitors a year at @entity8 , it is only natural that they would seek a bit of peace and quiet			2
