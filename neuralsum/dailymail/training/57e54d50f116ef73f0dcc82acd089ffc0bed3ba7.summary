a couple has lost their bid for compensation from a travel agent after they said their holiday to @entity7 was ruined by the call to prayer from a nearby mosque			1
the man and woman , who have not been named , demanded half of the £ 1,900 they spent on the all - inclusive break , claiming they were disturbed by the sound of the @entity18 repeated five times a day			1
they alleged their holiday , to the @entity7 town of @entity23 on the @entity25 coast , was ruined by the ' noise ' , which summoned @entity28 worshippers to prayers from a loudspeaker mounted on a nearby mosque from 6am			2
call to prayer : the claim said the ' noise ' of the @entity18 , from local mosque , ruined the couple 's holiday the @entity39 couple filed the complaint against a travel agent in @entity42 , saying they were not able to relax at the five - star @entity44			1
and they wanted the compensation to reflect there was an armrest missing from their chair on the flight to @entity7 , and they had to endure a bumpy landing on the return journey			0
however , the complaint was last week dismissed by @entity42 district court , which found the travel agent , that has not been named , was not at fault			0
the ruling added that the couple should have expected to be exposed to the sounds of the call to prayer due to the hotel being the centre of town – and said it was a local feature akin to the ringing of church bells in @entity39			1
popular destination : @entity71 in @entity7 , near where the couple was staying ‘ the complainants should have taken this authentic sound into account while booking for the resort , ’ the court said			2
‘ the call to prayer is customary in @entity7 and is comparable with church bells in a @entity83 country , " the court said , according to newspaper @entity79			2
‘ this does not constitute a deficiency of service			0
’ the court also ruled that the bumpy landing was due to the weather , something that was beyond the control of the tourism company			0
‘ since any landing is dependent on the weather conditions , over which the air carrier has no influence , flight passengers have to expect to deal with isolated cases of rough touch downs , ’ the court added .			0

couple claimed £ 1,900 all - inclusive holiday was ' ruined ' by the @entity18
man and woman allege ' noise ' five times a day meant they could *n't* relax
