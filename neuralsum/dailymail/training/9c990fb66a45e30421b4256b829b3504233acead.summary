by @entity1 reporter published : 15:56 est , 2 november 2013 updated : 15:57 est , 2 november 2013 a librarian in @entity3 claims that she witnessed her boss and a city maintenance worker having sex in the library 's children 's section earlier this year and reported it to her superiors - and then she got fired			1
the alleged incident happened one morning in august - @entity14 assistant librarian @entity13 got to work a little early and noticed two cars in the library 's parking lot : her boss ' and a city maintenance truck			2
she did n't find anything strange about the maintenance truck being in the library 's parking lot - until she walked in the building			0
canned : @entity13 claimed she was fired for reporting that she caught her boss having sex at work nothing suspicious : @entity13 said she did n't think anything of it when she saw a maintenance truck in the library 's parking lot ' [ @entity33 ] turned around and saw two other employees engaged in sexual intercourse on the floor in the children 's section , ' @entity13 's attorney , @entity32 , told @entity39			1
@entity13 identified the two as her boss , the head librarian , and a maintenance worker - both of whom , she says , are married to other people			0
@entity13 says the maintenance worker told her to not say anything about the incident to anyone			0
but she did - @entity13 took her complaint to the city library director , and ultimately to @entity53 's mayor @entity52			1
' the mayor subsequently talked to @entity13 about it , told her that it would n't have any effect on her job , ' @entity32 says			2
scene of the crime : @entity13 says her boss had sex in the children 's section of the library however , after the head librarian returned to work , she complained that @entity13 was creating a hostile work environment and she was fired , presumably at the directive of the mayor			1
the library director also was fired			0
on october 10 , @entity71 sent @entity13 a termination letter explaining that her firing was the result of her failure to turn over a library key while she was on leave			2
' our refusal to turn over @entity81 property upon request and as required to ensure uninterrupted library services shows a lack of cooperation and willingness to work with supervisors , ' wrote @entity71 in the letter			0
' this behavior constitutes insubordination and jeopardizes the @entity81 's ability to serve its citizens			0
' @entity32 , however , claims @entity13 was fired in an attempt to sweep the incident with the head librarian and the maintenance worker under the rug - according to @entity32 , the unidentified couple are locals who are ' close ' with the mayor			1
coverup : @entity13 attorney thinks she was fired because mayor @entity71 ( pictured ) is friends with the pair she caught having sex in the library in a recorded conversation between @entity13 and the head librarian - made in attempt to corroborate @entity13 's claim - the librarian does n't actually admit to having sex in the children 's section , but does tell @entity108 that ' if she ca n't handle the situation , [ she ] should find another job , ' according to @entity39 , which listended to the recording			1
@entity32 says that the mayor 's actions could result in him firing a whistleblower lawsuit on @entity13 behalf .			0

@entity13 says she was fired because the town 's mayor is trying to cover up the library sex *scandal* because she is a friend of the couple @entity13 caught having sex
the mayor claims @entity13 was fired because she failed to return a key while she was on leave
@entity134 boss did n't admit to having sex at work , but told her ' if she ca n't handle the situation , [ she ] should find another job , '
