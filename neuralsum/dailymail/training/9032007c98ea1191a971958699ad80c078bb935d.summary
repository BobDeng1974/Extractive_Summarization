a holidaymaker staying at a @entity2 hotel could n't help but take a picture when he spotted posters telling guests how to use a @entity8 - style toilet			1
the signs , which illustrate the right and wrong ways for guests to go about their business , were posted in the loos of a hotel in @entity15 in the @entity16			1
the instructions tell users to sit on the toilet , rather than squat on the edge of the rim , or spread their legs out wide or , in what must the the strangest instruction , not to carry out handstands			2
how to : according to this sign , toilet users should sit rather than squat , do handstands or spread their legs according to the @entity30 , which featured the sign after the unnamed guest posted them on a @entity2 networking site , the man found it so funny that he started ' cracking up ' and had to ' hold in his tummy for three minutes '			0
the unnamed hotel responded to the guest 's comment , saying : ' there are certainly people that would use the toilet by putting their feet on the toilet seat			0
' so , while laughing to your heart 's content , be sure to follow the rules on how to use the toilet			0
' toilets in the @entity50 are usually suitable for squatting , so it 's not surprising that instructions were required to show users the right way to use a seated loo			2
other signs placed in toilets tell guests not to fish , perch on or stand up whilst using the loo			1
dos and don'ts : whilst some instructions are obvious , there are others which are hard to understand			0

a @entity8 *visitor* spotted the signs and posted them *online*
instructions tell guests how to use the loo in the correct manner
*majority* of toilets in @entity75 are holes in the ground known as ' squat toilets '
