the @entity9 home , which boasts a runway for a private jet , hangar and spacious living quarters , looks like an innocuous log cabin at ground level but conceals a vast silo and missile launch control centre beneath			1
the silo , which is reinforced and was designed to withstand a direct hit from a nuclear bomb , has now been turned into a two - level residence , with three bedrooms , two bathrooms and an open living area and kitchen			1
@entity49 , a former pilot , said : ' once you 're inside its great to say hey , let 's check out the basement , hit a code and then enter a 50ft tunnel which takes you to where the missile was			2
' @entity49 bought the missile silo with @entity52 in the early 1990s , after it had spent 30 years underwater and needed cleaning and renovating			2
' there are so many possibilities for the @entity68 , ' added @entity49			2
' it would be great for yoga retreats , business conferences or for a community purpose , as well as an amazing home			0
' ' i think it would ideally suited to be a community base , as there are plenty of outdoor activities to do in the park like cycling and walking			0
' i am attached the the @entity68 as we spent so long working on it , but i would like to see it put to good use			0
' spacious : the upper floor contains a luxury open - plan living area , complete with a granite work top and stunning views of the surrounding @entity53 bunker : a door in the kitchen leads to a staircase down to the missile storage area where you need to enter a code to get past the reinforced metal door ( right ) @entity100 : the vast bunker doors were intended to withstand a nuclear attack - enabling the @entity104 technicians within to hit back at aggressors if necessary reinforced : the huge underground silotube was designed to take a direct nuclear strike and once housed nuclear armaments within hidden away : from the outside , the neat log cabin home looks much like any other house and is surrounded by the beautiful @entity53 clue : while the innocuous house does n't give much away , the adjoining runway and hangar hint at the building 's former military use historic : the silotube is remarkably well preserved , despite having spent 30 years underwater			1
