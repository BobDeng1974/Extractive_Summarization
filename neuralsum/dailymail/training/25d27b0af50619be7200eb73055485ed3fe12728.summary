when you ’re decorating your home , colour inspiration can come from the most unexpected of places			0
often , and frustratingly , it comes from something you ca n’t take home with you , such as stranger ’s bag or the colour of a particular car			0

it lets users send @entity12 photos to a computer server which matches each photo 's primary and complementary colours with 1,500 paints			1
the swatches are sent back to the user , who can then use the app to locate the nearest @entity23 shop to pick up the paint			1
