by @entity0 a 400 - foot section of a bridge in @entity3 has been closed after a motorist noticed the bridge was beginning to sag			1

‘ there 's a part that 's sagging , ’ a driver told a 911 operator			2
‘ a part that 's sagging ? ’ the operator asked			0
‘ instead of a bump , it 's a dip , ’ the driver said			0
no one has been injured			0
police closed the bridge , known as the @entity6 , before sunrise wednesday it appears the dip was caused by one of the pillars that holds up the bridge which sank around two feet into the ground			1
the bridge , which carries 40,000 cars a day , will be closed indefinitely			1
‘ we understand the disruption this is going to cause to traffic , ’ said @entity3 transportation secretary @entity42			0
as straight as an arrow : here 's how it normally looks ... without any kinks the bridge was built in 1980 and last inspected in august 2012 when it was declared sound and renovated shortly thereafter			1
the closure created traffic chaos in @entity23			0
cause : the likely culprit is the settling of @entity56 , a support pillar that is on the east approach to the bridge			2
the pier settled a little over two feet , and the state @entity61 will continue taking periodic measurements to see if it 's continuing to move ‘ it 's a big hassle , because of all the construction that 's going around town , ’ said @entity64 of @entity23			2
‘ the downtown bridge was closed for how long ? now this one is out ? it 's just like it 's a never - ending problem here			1
’ governor @entity71 spoke on the closure wednesday afternoon during a press conference			0
' it 's a key transportation link in the area , ' @entity71 said			0
' our # 1 priority is and will continue to be ensuring the absolute safety of the public			0
' the @entity80 has set up detours in the meantime			0
the @entity61 does n't have a timeline or a price tag on fixing the bridge just yet			1
governor @entity71 promised repairs will happen , whatever the cost			0
' once we know the full details of what 's required to fix this bridge , we will fix this bridge , ' the governor said , ' because it 's not only important to @entity95 , it 's also important to the @entity3			2
' governor @entity71 said the @entity96 over the @entity10 is ' vitally important ' to commerce in @entity98 and @entity99 but that the safety of people who would be on or around the bridge will be the primary factor in determining how long the bridge will be closed			1
' once we know the full details of what 's required to fix this bridge , we will fix this bridge , ' governor @entity71 said , ' because it 's not only important to @entity95 , it 's also important to the @entity3 ' diversions in place : the bridge , formerly known as the @entity6 bridge , will remain closed indefinitely as inspections continue state officials say the bridge is in no danger of collapsing like the @entity118 bridge over the @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121 , this spring			1
in that incident , a tractor - trailer struck a support on the bridge , which had been rated ‘ functionally obsolete , ’ sending several cars plunging into the river below			1
no one died , but three people were taken to the hospital for treatment the @entity3 bridge is named after @entity133 , who ran @entity134 until his retirement in 1983			2
a former member of @entity138 religious orders , he was well - known in the area for his work with ex-convicts and for founding a @entity23 food pantry , according to his official biography on the pantry 's website			2
