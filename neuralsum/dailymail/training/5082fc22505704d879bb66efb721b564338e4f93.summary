by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 23 september 2013 the number of new hiv infections has plummeted by a third since 2001 and more than halved among children , the @entity1 has said			1
globally , 2.3 million people contracted the @entity8 virus last year - down 33 per cent from 2001 , while 260,000 children became infected - 52 per cent less than in 2001			1
‘ the annual number of new hiv infections continues to decline with especially sharp reductions in the number of children newly infected with @entity16 , ’ said @entity11 executive director @entity10			1
the number of new hiv infections has plummeted by a third since 2001 and more than halved among children			1
@entity11 executive director , @entity10 ( pictured ) , has put this down to the increasing availability of antiretroviral drugs hailing progress in distributing antiretroviral drugs that prevent the transmission of the virus from pregnant women to their unborn children , the @entity1 body said it may be possible to slash new infections among children by 90 per cent in the next two years			1
in its annual report on the state of the global pandemic , the agency said the drugs had prevented more than 670,000 children contracting the human immunodeficiency virus ( @entity16 ) which causes @entity8 between 2009 and 2012 alone			1
in @entity40 - home to 90 per cent of the world 's 3.3 million infected children - the decline was particularly striking			1
in @entity45 , for instance , 90 per cent of pregnant , @entity16 - positive women had access to antiretroviral treatment last year , up from just 32 per cent three years earlier			1
as a result , the likelihood of women in the country infecting their unborn children dropped from 31 per cent in 2009 to just nine per cent last year , said @entity11			1
increased access to the drug ‘ cocktail ’ which curtails @entity16 transmission but does not cure it , has helped reduce the number of @entity8 - related deaths among all age groups by 30 per cent since they peaked in 2005 , the report said			1
globally , 2.3 million people contracted the @entity8 virus ( pictured ) last year - down 33 per cent from 2001 , while 260,000 children became infected - 52 per cent less than in 2001 in a foreword to the 269 - page report , mr @entity10 hailed ‘ continued progress towards the global vision of zero new hiv infections , zero discrimination and zero @entity8 - related deaths ’			1
last year , 1.6 million people died @entity8 - related deaths , down from 1.8 million in 2011 and 2.3 million in 2005			1
the report showed that 9.7 million people in low and middle - income countries , the bulk of those infected , had access to @entity16 drugs last year , compared to only 1.3 million seven years earlier			1
while the hike is impressive , it falls short of a @entity1 target announced two years ago to reach 15 million people by 2015			1
the drugs prevented more than 670,000 children contracting @entity16 between 2009 and 2012 and it represents only 34 per cent of the 28.3 million people who need the drugs , under new guidelines released by the @entity87 in june			1
the increased access to treatment also means that more people are living with @entity16 , according to @entity11			2
some 35.3 million people were living with the virus last year -- about 70 per cent of them in @entity40 - up from 30 million in 2001			1
mr @entity10 insisted the 2015 target for global access to antiretrovirals remained in sight , but stressed the world must ‘ have the vision and commitment to ensure no one is left behind ’			0
obviously , this will put a strain on world purse strings			2
@entity11 said international donor contributions to combating @entity16 had remained flat since the global financial crisis began in 2008 , and individual countries were increasingly picking up the tab to beat @entity16 at home			2
last year , nations accounted for 53 per cent of the $ 18.9 billion set aside to fight the virus			2
the @entity1 has set a target of $ 22 - 24 billion by 2015			2
earlier this year , mr @entity10 insisted the investment would pay off , pointing out that ‘ fewer deaths , less sickness ’ takes a burden off the healthcare system , allowing hiv - positive people to work and contribute to the economy for longer			1
‘ if we do not pay now , we will pay later , we 'll pay forever , ’ he said			0
share what you think the comments below have been moderated in advance			0
@entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , 1 day ago guess what countries paid for this			0
xxx , xxx , @entity132 , 1 day ago this is encouraging news , but there is a downside as it leads to public complacency , if they think there is less likelihood of catching @entity16 or that modern drugs will control it			2
@entity16 / @entity8 is truly dreadful			1
many people do n't realise the downside of the drugs regime , once they have @entity16			1
also , that you do n't die of @entity8 , you die of other issues , often cancer ( s ) because the immune system is severely damaged			2
i have seen friends die of it and visited them in hospital , so know what i am talking about			0
please protect yourself and others			0
@entity155 , wherever , 1 day ago whether you like him or hate him , @entity158 's @entity157 program has everything to do with this good news			0
he asked for 5.4 billion dollars to fund the program in 2008			0
that was back when presidents were actually submitting budgets			0
what has @entity165 done for the world ? no , really ? ! @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , 1 day ago let 's hope it continues			0
proper education is needed also - people need to know that sleeping around is what is spread this disease			2
i am sick and tired of hearing how " condoms " prevent @entity8			2
no - condoms are not accurate , and the only way to prevent @entity8 to know your partner			1
i am sick of reading people bringing the @entity184 into it because they do n't condone the use of condoms			0
the @entity184 promotes sexual abstinence until marriage			0
not having sex = no @entity8			2
people often " forget " that part			0
secondly , the @entity184 runs 27 % of all @entity8 clinics in @entity40 ( free of charge )			1
we need to work together , not constantly trying to smear others whilst adding nothing of your own			0
@entity199 , @entity200 @entity132 , 1 day ago great news ! hope the infection rate continues to decline			0
@entity203 , @entity204 , @entity132 , 1 day ago some good news for once ! one man band , @entity207 , 1 day ago @entity16 or @entity208 's scares the hell out of me			0
i may have a phobia for the word itself			0
brian , malaga , 1 day ago and even more could be achieved by education and the acceptance that the use of condoms is a vital contributory factor			0
of course , those of a certain religious persuasion will claim that male genital mutilation ( circumcision ) was a key factor , which of course , is utter nonsense			0
@entity224 , @entity225 , @entity127 , 1 day ago well , this is great news , and i hope we can continue this trend until we have found a cure			0

2.3 million people were infected globally last year - 33 % less than in 2001
260,000 children were infected - 52 % less than in 2001
the fall in the number of new infections has been put down to the increasingly *widespread* availability of antiretroviral drugs
this has also led to a 30 % drop in the number of @entity8 - related deaths since 2005
