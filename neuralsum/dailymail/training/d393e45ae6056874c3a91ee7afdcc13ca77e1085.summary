dressed in woolly tights , leggings , an all - in - one vest and fleecy top , nine - month - old @entity0 seemed well wrapped up for winter			1
but that did not stop a passer - by dialling 999 to report her mother @entity6 for exposing a child to the cold			1
two policemen were immediately sent to @entity11 seafront to question her about @entity0 ’s welfare			2
@entity14 was playing on the promenade with her nine - month - old daughter @entity0 when a police van and two officers turned up and began to question her ‘ we ’d not even been there ten minutes when the police turned up , ’ said mrs @entity0 , who has two other children aged 12 and 14			1
‘ they could see everything was ok , but they told me that they ’d had an anonymous call saying there was a little girl playing on the promenade and she was cold			1
‘ i explained that she was fine and @entity0 certainly looked fine			2
i told them that we came out to the prom all the time to play			0
i am not convinced police should be harassing mums playing with their babies			1
’ mrs @entity0 , who refused to give her name to the officers , said one had claimed it was their duty to ‘ keep an eye on these things ’			2
the temperature was @entity44 when she was interrogated last friday			0
the nutritionist , 43 , who has two older children aged 14 and 12 , was told an anonymous 999 call had alleged her baby daughter looked cold the 43 - year - old nutritionist said : ‘ @entity0 was covered up and was n’t cold , that was clear			1
it simply did n’t merit the hassle			0
‘ where do you draw the line ? do you police children wearing too many clothes on the beach in summer ? can people dial 999 if they suspect a parent has n’t put enough sun cream on a youngster ? they ’d be better off policing @entity63 ’s and checking that children are not eating too much in there			1
’ mrs @entity0 was on the promenade with @entity0 while her financier husband @entity67 , 49 , was surfing off the beach			0
she added : ‘ it can take more than an hour for police to turn up if i call in complaining about yobs at the back of my house and sometimes they do n’t attend at all , but an anonymous call can send them racing to the promenade			1
’ when one of the policemen asked mrs @entity0 her name , she responded : ‘ this is ridiculous			0
’ mrs @entity0 was with her daughter on the promenade , while her financier husband @entity67 , 49 , was surfing off the beach at @entity11			1
she had been out of the car for less than 10 minutes when the police arrived after refusing to reveal who she was , mrs @entity0 , from @entity11 , was asked : ‘ so you do n’t want to co-operate ? ’ she said : ‘ i told them that it was a mother ’s right to play with her daughter and it was n’t a co-operation thing			2
‘ i added that they ’d be taking her to the social workers next if i gave them my details			0
i was n’t doing anything wrong , so i walked off			0
’ a @entity98 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ all reports concerning the safety of children are taken very seriously by @entity98 and must be properly checked out			0
’ but @entity102 , an ex-policeman and writer , said the case typified what was wrong with modern policing			0
‘ this is by far the barmiest cold case i have ever come across , ’ he added			0
‘ do officers now need a thermometer to take children ’s temperatures along with their truncheons ? the mother is clearly not committing a crime by taking her child for a walk along the promenade			2
‘ in most areas it is easier to order a takeaway pizza and get it delivered than get a response to an emergency 999 call , so it is astonishing that , when there is a swift response , it is to a totally innocent lady playing with her baby			1
