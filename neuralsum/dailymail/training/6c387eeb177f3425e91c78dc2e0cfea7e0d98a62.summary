the @entity1 placed a recruitment advert for new members in the house magazine of the notorious @entity5 , it emerged yesterday			1
@entity7 ’s deputy leader @entity6 and her mp husband @entity8 say @entity5 was banished before she became the @entity1 ’s legal officer in 1978			1
but disturbing new evidence contradicts this claim – and reveals further embarrassingly close ties between the @entity1 and the paedophile group campaigning to legalise sex with children			0
former health minister and @entity1 general secretary @entity36 shared a conference platform with @entity5 leader @entity39 in 1977			1
details of the new links came as @entity39 claimed the two women ‘ did n’t even try ’ to remove the paedophile group from the @entity1 in case it harmed their careers			1
the three senior @entity7 figures all held key roles in the council – which astonishingly granted ‘ affiliate ’ status to the group of predatory paedophiles that was calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four			1
when miss @entity6 earlier this week belatedly expressed ‘ regret ’ – but refused to apologise – for @entity5 being allowed to forge links with the @entity1 , she said the paedophile group ‘ had been pushed to the margin ’ before she began working there			1
yet , during the year after she took up her post , the @entity1 advert appeared in @entity5 ’s april journal			2
it ran inside a shocking 24 - page special edition of the magazine – the cover of which shows a picture of a young boy wearing only a small pair of shorts as he plays tennis			0
on an inside page the council ’s advert appears alongside two more pictures of young boys in provocative poses , including one in what appears to be a @entity23 kit , sitting down with his legs apart			0
it invites @entity31 readers to ‘ join the @entity1 ’ and boasts that the organisation is ‘ working to protect and extend human rights in the @entity84 ’			0
the appeal for new members and donations was published after a feature titled : child porn , a heterosexual viewpoint			2
the journal , sent to @entity5 members , included news on paedophiles , articles on child porn and cartoons mocking assaults on children			1
these depicted abuse in a scout master ’s tent , naked children and adults queuing up outside a bedroom for an ‘ assault course ’			2
the ‘ year of the child ’ edition – a distasteful twist on the @entity109 designating 1979 as the ‘ @entity110 ’ – came with a ‘ contact page ’ , which members could use to get in touch with other paedophiles , share images and advertise for children to abuse			1
@entity6 has expressed regret that a civil liberties group she and her husband @entity8 mp worked for in the 1970s had links with a pro-paedophile campaigning group miss @entity36 shared a platform with @entity5 founder @entity39 at a gay rights conference organised by the @entity1			1
the former @entity7 minister appeared with him at the one - day event entitled ‘ a @entity127 for @entity128 ’ and organised by the council ’s @entity129			1
a cutting from the left - wing @entity132 , said @entity137 ‘ spoke of the council ’s work on gay rights over the past two years ’			2
an item in @entity31 from may 1977 confirms that @entity39 addressed the @entity1 conference			0
under the heading ‘ notes and news ’ , it states : ‘ @entity39 , our secretary , was one of two speakers talking about the treatment of sexual offenders in prison at the one day - conference organised by the @entity129 of the @entity1 on may 14th			0
’ @entity39 condemned the practice of chemical castration of paedophiles during a discussion at the event			0
a file about the conference in the archives of the @entity1 – which later became the respected pressure group @entity1 – at the @entity157 contains a paper @entity39 prepared on chemical castration , which was due to be included in a booklet by the council published in 1978			2
conference : former health secretary @entity36 ( left ) shared a platform with leader of pie @entity165 but miss @entity36 objected to the essay ’s inclusion and said the group should be trying to destroy the myth that ‘ gay men are also paedophiles ’ , not add to the confusion by ‘ including a paper about the treatment of paedophile offenders in a pamphlet on gay rights ’			1
in a memo in june 1978 , she reported encountering opposition to her decision to pull @entity39 ’s work from her own gay rights sub-committee			0
it states that the @entity184 would have to decide whether or not to include @entity39 ’s work in the pamphlet			0
a copy of what appears to be the final version in the file does not contain @entity39 ’s piece			0
documents from both groups also reveal how , in the first half of 1977 , the @entity1 went in to bat for @entity5 when the vile group believed it had been slighted by a judge during his sentencing of a man convicted of blackmailing one of its member			1
edited extracts from the correspondence reprinted in @entity31 show how the @entity1 described it as a ‘ campaigning ’ organisation			0
the letters were apparently written by @entity206 , @entity1 ’s gay rights organiser			0
speaking to the @entity207 said : ‘ at the time @entity208 and @entity36 could n’t just kick us out , or they could but they did n’t try			2
the reason was their careers in the @entity1 depended upon them not rocking the boat too much			0

abuse group leader , @entity165 said : they did *n't* try and make us leave
appeal for members was published in ' @entity35 ' edition in 1979
former minister @entity36 shared platform with @entity5 leader in 1977
three senior @entity7 figures all held key roles in the council
@entity231 granted ‘ affiliate ’ status to the group of predatory paedophiles
