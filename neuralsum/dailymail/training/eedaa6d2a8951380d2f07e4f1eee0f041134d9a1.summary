by @entity0 the government has abandoned plans to hold a vote on repealing the controversial hunting ban before the next election			1
despite the coalition agreement pledging that @entity8 would be allowed a free vote on the highly - strung issue , senior conservatives have decided there is no point holding a vote before the election as most mps support the status quo			1
however , the @entity17 reports that @entity18 has been issued a stern warning by countryside groups that rural communities will be less inclined to support the @entity23 's election campaign if a promise to repeal the ban is not included in the @entity23 manifesto			1
@entity28 hunting has been banned since 2004 and the @entity29 have now dropped their pledge to reverse this decision before the next election some pro-hunting groups already feel let - down by the conservatives , who promised to lift the ban in their 2010 manifesto			1
however , others accept that waiting until a vote is more likely to pass is the right move			2
@entity41 , @entity23 mp for @entity42 , who is also on the board of the @entity45 , told @entity17 he would not ' shed too many tears ' over the decision to drop the vote			2
he said : ' i would much rather vote on the real thing when we think we have got the numbers to alter the outcome			0
the manifesto has got to be clear and unequivocal [ about repealing the act ]			0
' the @entity56 is one of the most controversial measures of @entity60 's premiership and he has since expressed regret and pushing it through the commons abandoning the vote has avoided another potential bust - up in the @entity65 , as deputy prime minister @entity66 said that even if the vote went ahead and the majority of mps favoured lifting the ban , the @entity67 would not agree to scrap the @entity56			0
the @entity56 was introduced by @entity60 in 2004 and has proved to be one of the most controversial domestic measures of his premiership			0
mr @entity60 has since expressed his regret at pushing the legislation through .			0

senior @entity29 drop pledge to hold vote despite it being *signed* off in coalition agreement
they believe it is unlikely to pass if held before next year 's election
rural groups are *demanding* @entity29 include pledge in next manifesto
