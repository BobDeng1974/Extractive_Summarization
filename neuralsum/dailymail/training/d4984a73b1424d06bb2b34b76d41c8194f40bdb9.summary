a tall woman wearing a blonde wig and a low - cut red dress pursed her scarlet lips and asked if i 'd like to be photographed with her			1
' who are you ? ' i asked			2
' i 'm @entity7 , ' she said			2
of course ! but she could have been @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity10			2
a man has to be careful			2
i was on @entity12 , where cinema 's good and great have been imprinting their hands , shoes and signatures in the pavement for almost 90 years			1
this is the epicentre of the tourist vision of @entity20 , where you can see the @entity22 , the @entity23 , @entity24 , the @entity25 and souvenir shops			1
blonde moment : @entity27 with a @entity7 lookalike on @entity12 lookalikes of @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 were on duty when i arrived , and have become part of the attraction			2
i duly snuggled up with @entity7 , pausing to reflect whether @entity7 had quite such a cleavage , and slipped her some dollars			0
but this was n't the @entity22 i was here for			0
i wanted to see the hidden @entity22 , the hip @entity22 - the places frequented by the people who make the movies			1
they do n't hang around here , except on @entity47 night when they arrive and disappear by limousine			0
to be fair to @entity22 , i had to give it a whirl			0
i 'd visited @entity52 numerous times over the past 40 years but had never done the ' homes of the stars ' tour			0
i did n't want to be seen gawping			0
star gazing : the @entity60 bus tour includes visits to the homes of @entity63 and @entity64 i bought a @entity65 for $ 59 ( £ 34 ) that gave me entry to some attractions as well as a @entity60 bus tour			1
i 'd wrongly assumed that these tours visited the homes of stars from all eras , but the focus was very much on the big names of today			0
the first five houses ( in order ) belonged to @entity78 , @entity63 , @entity79 , @entity64 and @entity80			1
the bigger the star , though , the higher the wall			0
too often i was left with glimpses of rooftops or upstairs windows			0
nevertheless , the two - hour tour served as an introduction to the layout of mythical @entity22 from @entity89 and @entity90 to @entity91 and @entity92			1
i felt just as dubious , at first , about the prospect of visiting the @entity23 , home of the @entity47 , with another of my passes			0
i did n't think there was anything about the ceremony i could learn in a 40 - minute tour			1
tourist trap : the movie makers do n't hang out on @entity12 - except on @entity47 night i learned that storefronts outside the theatre are draped on the night to hide any advertising , that the material value of a @entity47 is £ 300 , and all the statuettes are numbered because they 're presented unengraved and are often mislaid in the bar			1
we were taken up the theatre 's sweeping stairs			1
' they 're made for women with high heels , ' said our guide			0
' they 're wide and shallow - the stairs that is , not the women			2
' in the bar we were shown an actual @entity47 ( in a glass case ) and finally we went on to the stage itself , where we could imagine giving our acceptance speeches			0
something else i did n't know was that actors must apply to have their stars on the pavement of @entity12			0
the @entity126 decides who fits , and it costs the applicant £ 21,000			0
concentration of cool : a vintage clothes store in @entity132 , which locals refer to as @entity134 but all this was a long way from the true heartbeat of @entity22			1
the ( mostly ) young people who write the scripts , design the costumes , create the music , direct the action and act in the movies live , work and play elsewhere			2
i asked my friend @entity145 , an adjunct professor at the @entity147 's @entity146 , and a consultant to studios such as @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 , to draw me up an itinerary of cool venues			1
and so i stayed at the @entity155 ( 9400 west @entity156 ) , a smart yet unassuming hotel tucked away in a residential corner of @entity159			1
it was once the @entity161 , and home to @entity7			0
its decor is so convincingly late 1950s/early 1960s that you half expect @entity165 to saunter in , flanked by a couple of heavies			0
retro look : @entity169 and @entity170 are fans of the @entity172 at 6145 @entity173 @entity90 is just a walk away from the @entity155 and is jammed full of top designer clothing and jewellery stores			1
one of them , @entity178 , is believed to be the most expensive store in the world			0
you can only enter by appointment and the average customer spend is £ 60,000			0
@entity22 's hip creatives prefer streets that seem a little meaner			2
one of the favoured spots at the moment is in the @entity189 on @entity173 between @entity190 and @entity191			0
the 101 @entity192 at 6145 @entity173 has a juke box , pebbledashed ceiling , faux rock wall , and prominently displayed framed family photographs			2
it feels like a 1970s diner untouched by time but has actually been retro - designed and attracts the likes of @entity170 , @entity201 , @entity169 and @entity63 to its leather booths			1
over the music of the @entity206 i could hear the sounds of deals being done			2
at night , the sidewalk between here and @entity191 bustles			0
the biggest attraction on the block - and the one that drew the longest queue - was the @entity216 's @entity215 at 5919 @entity173			1
here , comedy shows play every night			0
i got into a patchy 90 - minute stand - up show for £ 3			1
the next event was a q&a with producer / director / writer @entity221 , of @entity222 and bridesmaids fame , that sold out			0
cosy hangout : a customer is pictured taking tea at the @entity228 on @entity229 rivalling what locals refer to as @entity134 is @entity132 , to the immediate east of @entity233			1
the highest concentration of cool is both sides of @entity229			2
here i found high - end specialist shops - @entity237 for vinyl , @entity240 for comic books , @entity242 for flowers			1
the clothing stores are similarly specialised ; @entity246 for vintage , @entity245 for military cast - offs , @entity249 & does for jeans and shirts			2
@entity252 , a hostess at the fashionable @entity253 , told me : ' there are a lot of young creatives who live around here , but not like those at @entity134			0
' @entity261 ( 3922 @entity229 ) is the neighbourhood meeting place			1
rows of @entity266 @entity265 tappers sat outside at single tables , with one eye on their screen and the other on the parade of people			0
at the cosy @entity228 ( 3900 @entity229 ) , the girl next to me with a laptop was working on a screenplay			1
dead famous : @entity277 has been spotted at the @entity278 on @entity279 @entity52 is the latest area to be infiltrated by artists , film - makers , musicians and writers			1
they are taking over old industrial spaces and lofts in an area designated the @entity289 , resulting in an edgy mix of poverty , creativity and refurbishment			0
the @entity294 ( 451 @entity295 ) , where you can drink organic coffee and eat home - baked pasties , is around the corner from skid row			1
back in @entity22 , @entity145 recommended that i check out the @entity278 ( 6000 @entity279 )			1
it 's making a name as a music - show venue			1
' they also have outdoor movie events , ' she told me			0
' it 's a very cool scene there among the tombstones and crypts of legends like @entity312 , @entity8 and @entity313			1
' shoppers ' paradise : the street sign on the exclusive @entity90 and , right , a face - painted couple mark @entity318 at the @entity319 the big event while i was there was @entity318 - the @entity318			2
i 'd never had such a good time in a graveyard			0
the place was packed with makeshift altars , temporary stages and food stalls for an event that mocks death and celebrates ancestors			0
@entity333 music boomed , @entity335 dancers shook their feathers and people sat on gravestones painting each other 's faces to look like grinning skulls			1
@entity277 recently turned up at @entity278 for a @entity342 ( both @entity277 and @entity343 of the @entity344 are cemetery residents )			1
the irony is that most of @entity22 's cool ' new ' places have already been cool , in the past			1
@entity52 was @entity351 's patch , @entity349 headed there on his first @entity353 visit in 1947 and @entity132 was where @entity152 established his first studio in 1926			2
just as you think you 've found it , it pops up somewhere else			0
' it 's not really a place , ' @entity145 said			2
' more a state of mind			0
' @entity360 ( vhiphotels.co.uk , 0844 573 2460 ) offers seven nights in @entity362 from £ 999pp			0
this includes return flights from @entity365 , room - only accommodation at @entity155 and private transfers .			1

venues such as the @entity155 hotel and 101 coffee shop attract the cool crowd
diner 's customers include @entity170 , @entity201 and @entity63
locals love specialist shops like @entity237 and @entity240
screenplay writers head to @entity261 and the cosy @entity228
@entity278 is making a name as a music - show venue
