by @entity0 this south west @entity2 home can be seen in everything from tv adverts to photos on luxury design websites - and @entity7 has even lounged on the garden furniture			2
and though you would probably not recognise the stylish sofas or clean white walls , the homeowner makes up to £ 1200 a day handing over the keys to directors and photographers who have used his house for hundreds of shoots			2
now for the first time , theatre producer @entity19 has opened his front door to reveal @entity23 's most - photographed home - his four - floor terraced townhouse in @entity25 , @entity2			1
advertisers and tv executives spend a day filming or photographing inside for projects as varied as computer game adverts to glossy celebrity magazines			0
they often transform the two - bedroom home is into an unrecognisable studio in less than 12 hours , before repainting the walls and turning it back into the house mr @entity19 left in the morning			1
@entity57 , 46 , said : ' it ’s bizarre when you ’re watching the telly or flicking through a magazine suddenly you think , oh blimey that ’s my living room			0
' sometimes they ’ll put wallpaper up for just a day but it all gets put back - you just have to be very relaxed about what happens when you ’re out of the house ! ' the lower - ground floor of @entity19 ’s home has a huge open plan living space and double doors onto a garden that has hosted photo shoots for @entity7			1
exotic : the agency said that mr @entity19 's beautiful garden , pictured , is a huge draw for shoot directors looking for locations			1
the owner said that coming home in the middle of his home 's first shoot was a real shock natural beauty : with some simple white garden furniture - and tv presenter @entity88 - the @entity2 garden is transformed for a bright and bold magazine shoot city chic : one of mr @entity19 's pieces of furniture was brought outside for @entity7 to lounge on when she posed for this photo , right , that was printed as part of a glossy magazine spread upstairs , there ’s a kitchen where a food company spent hours photographing bacon sandwiches and there are two bedrooms and space for styling and quick changes			1
' getting it right for shoots and making it a home at the same time has been a challenge - you ’ve got to have enough interesting furniture and art to perk up the white walls			2
' the first two or three times we had a shoot i was left in shock - the volume of stuff they bring with them is incredible			0
we once had ten sofas in our living room plus camera crews and stylists			0
' i ’ve had them paint the walls and move everything around so it ’s barely recognisable more times than i can remember			0
@entity135 and airy : directors and photographers often transform the two - bedroom home is into an unrecognisable studio in less than 12 hours , before repainting the walls and turning it back into the house mr @entity19 left looks familiar : mr @entity19 's living space , pictured at the back of this image , had a handful of accessories added to it for this photo shoot , but it has sometimes hosted as many as 10 couches and dozens of soft furnishings pretty in pink : bright , textured accessories and subtle purple flowers are used to add warmth to mr @entity19 's neutral living space in this photograph from a magazine shoot young guests : sometimes it is just glimpses of mr @entity19 's much - photographed home that can be seen in photos or adverts , as with the two pictured above			1
the house 's natural light means it is an easy place for photographers to shoot ' they always paint it back though so i ’m sure there are 50 layers of the same paint colour on the walls			1
' when there are celebrities shooting in the house and i ’ve occasionally been working from home it ’s been a real eye - opener			0
' most people have been very gracious and unassuming but you very quickly get to know when some with an attitude is in and it is diva central			0
' although i live in a pretty minimal way i still have to work to keep the house in pretty good nick			0
distinctive rugs : directors and photographers often bring their own additional touches , like these rugs , to transform the way the @entity25 home looks in pictures prints and patterns : advertising executives using the house often cover the walls in wallpaper to create variation in their images , like in the ones pictured above			2
they later strip the house after the shoot caught on camera : an advert featuring mr @entity19 's house			2
he said that it is bizarre when he is watching the television or flicking through a magazine and comes across a photo of his living room ' when people come to look round - it ’s like an inspection from the school matron ! ' thankfully 1st option [ the location agency he registered with ] has been really helpful - they always let us know when someone will be coming round so we ’re prepared			0
' and the house is redecorated every couple of years to make sure it ’s bang on trend			0
we ’ve got to give all those photographers and directors a new back drop ! ” a 1st option spokesperson said : ' we ’ve been representing locations for stills and filming shoots for over 10 years and for the most part clients either want a blank canvas white location and they ’ll decorate and prop according to their needs or then they want a location they can walk into and shoot			1
classic colour : mr @entity19 's home features a number of white walls and pieces of furniture , allowing designers and directors to add their own pops of colour - like the pink cushions featured above - when they arrive for a shoot a-list guests : since signing up to a location agency seven years ago , mr @entity19 's home has had celebrities draped over its garden furniture , pictured , and photogenic babies crawling along the carpet understated elegance : mr @entity19 's garden , right , and an upstairs space in his home , left , as seen in photos taken from shoots			1
he said that he has to keep his decor updated and interesting without being too distinctive ' this home works well as a shoot location because of the variety it offers , lots of bright colours , good natural light and a fabulous garden			1
' a flexible owner always helps , @entity19 is very easy going and lets clients get on with their shoot , he allows decorating shoots and has had multiple day shoots allowing wallpapering , painting , blinds and curtains to be put up			2
the client then re-instates to the way it was after their shoot			0
' while we ’re always looking for new shoot locations , we ’re very particular about what we represent , the key elements are good natural light and space			1
' if you ’ve got a large traditional or modern house or apartment with nice features , wooden / parquet flooring , large bay / sash windows , traditional fireplaces , large open plan kitchen with island get in touch and we ’ll let you know if we think we can get you work			0
