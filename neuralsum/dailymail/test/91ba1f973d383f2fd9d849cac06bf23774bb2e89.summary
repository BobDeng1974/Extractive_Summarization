the @entity1 could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it , government chief whip @entity0 admitted last night			1
mr @entity0 , the former education secretary , said he could not rule out further cuts to child benefit to reduce the deficit			1
asked on the @entity9 's @entity8 if he could confirm that there would be ' no more changes to child benefit ' , mr @entity0 said : ' no i ca n't say that			1
' conservative chief whip @entity0 admitted the @entity1 could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it mr @entity0 said the @entity1 would not cut benefits for the disabled or pensioners – but refused to rule out cuts to child benefit			1
he said : ' there is a huge amount of welfare spending that can be reduced without having any impact on people who have disabilities			0
' we 're not going to hit , or take money away from , the disabled			0
we 're going to protect people who are pensioners			0
what we are going to do			0
' mr @entity0 was asked specifically : ' there will be no more changes to child benefit			1
can you say that to us ? ' he said : ' it 's not our policy at the moment			0
but the thing i would say is that we 've succeeded over the course of the last five years , not just in making departmental cuts which i 've alluded to , but in making £ 21billion worth of welfare cuts			2
all we 're asking to do is to do half of that again			0
' @entity46 , @entity48 's shadow work and pensions secretary , said : ' @entity0 's repeated refusal to rule out child benefit cuts will only add to fears that the @entity1 have a secret plan to cut support to children			1
' the @entity1 have a £ 12 billion black hole in their welfare plans it 's clear they ca n't fill without hitting families with children			2
it 's time for the @entity1 to come clean with the public about their plans to cut child benefit			2
' the revelation comes after @entity67 last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the @entity70 win a second term			1
asked on the @entity9 's @entity8 if he could confirm there will be ' no more changes to child benefit ' , mr @entity0 said : ' no i ca n't say that ' mr @entity0 's remarks came after @entity67 last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the @entity70 win a second term more than a million households lost out when the @entity80 announced that families with one parent earning £ 50,000 would pay tax on child benefit			1
earners over £ 60,000 lost out altogether			0
the controversial measure , brought in two and a half years ago as part of the government 's austerity programme , was criticised for penalising single - earner families and stay - at - home mothers			0
it meant anyone earning less than £ 50,000 – even a couple on £ 49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £ 20.70 a week for the first child , and £ 13.70 for every subsequent child			2
mr @entity67 was asked at a briefing in central @entity98 on the economy this morning whether he could ' rule out depriving more people of child benefit , like you 've already done in this @entity103 ? ' but the chancellor appeared to leave the door open to further cuts when asked if he would be ' depriving more families ' of the payments which are worth more than £ 1,000 per year			1
mr @entity67 did not directly answer about reducing the threshold , only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system @entity112 , which is being rolled out nationally			1
the respected think tank the @entity113 have suggested that increasing @entity112 for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £ 4.8billion a year			1
the chancellor said : ' you can judge us on our record in this @entity103			0
if we wanted to put child benefit into @entity112 we would have done it when we set up @entity112			1
' we 've got a track record , we 've got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay , sharpening work incentives			0
' asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts , he said : ' i 've given you a very clear answer			1
we 've created a welfare system where child poverty is down , inequality is down , we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable			2
' we are going to carry on doing that in the next @entity103			0
but we ca n't do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy			2
' the @entity70 say they would cut £ 30billion of spending if they win a second term			0
of this £ 12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill , with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance			0
while the prime minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension , few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family 's annual benefits from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000			0
it is widely speculated that the @entity70 could restrict child benefit to just two children , to save around £ 2billion a year .			2

asked if he could rule out child benefit cuts mr @entity0 said : ' i ca n't say that '
the chief whip ruled out any cuts to pensioner and disability benefits
comes after @entity67 paved the way for further cuts to payments
he refused to rule out rolling @entity175 into @entity112 system
