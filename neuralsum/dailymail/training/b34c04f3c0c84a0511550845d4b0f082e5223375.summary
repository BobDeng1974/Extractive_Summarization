a report from a @entity2 physician in 1740 contains what is thought to be the oldest medical record of a near - death experience has been discovered			1
the discovery was made by anthropologist dr @entity7 , who bought the book for about $ 1 ( 60p ) in an antique shop			0
in the book a patient is being described as falling unconscious and then seeing a pure bright light that they interpreted as being @entity14			0
a @entity2 medical record from 1740 ( shown ) was found to include the oldest known reference to a near - death experience ( @entity18 ) in a patient			1

he describes how his patient had vivid sensations associated with @entity24 the @entity26 criteria measures how strong of a near - death experience a person has had			1

at the time @entity21 attempted to explain the phenomenon by saying that an increase in blood flow to the brain could be the cause behind the visions			1
however , modern physicians now think that the odd sensations are actually caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain			1
‘ @entity18 ( @entity18 ) has been scientifically described as “ a profound psychological event with transcendental and mystical elements ” after a life - threatening crisis , ’ dr @entity7 writes in his paper			2
he describes these elements as awareness of being dead , positive emotions , out of body experience , the feeling of moving through a tunnel , communication with light , observation of colours of a celestial landscape , meeting with deceased people and a life review			0
@entity21 was born in 1733 but died in 1766 at the age of just 33 in the island @entity95 from a fever			0
his patient for this report was a @entity100 apothecary who had a malign fever			2
after his last blood test he fell unconscious for a long time , to such an extent that his assistant became worried			0
‘ he reported that after having lost all external sensations , he saw such a pure and extreme light that he thought he was in @entity14 ( literally : in the @entity108 ) , ’ writes dr @entity7			0
‘ he remembered this sensation very well , and affirmed that never of all his life had he had a nicer moment			0
‘ other individuals of various ages and sexes reported a very similar sensation in the same circumstances			0
’ @entity21 then compared this case with others caused by drowning , hypothermia and hanging , and deduced that all involved the loss of blood			2
he then writes that the abundant flow of blood back into the brain creates ‘ these vivid and strong sensations ’			1
during @entity24 people describe having vivid sensations that seem to suggest they are moving towards a light ( stock image shown ) accompanied by a pleasant sensation			1
@entity21 thought it was caused by an increase in blood flow to the brain but modern scientist now think it is actually caused by a lack of oxygen today opinion is divided on the true cause of @entity24			1
during such an event people describe having vivid sensations , sometimes out - of - body , that seem to suggest they are moving towards a light accompanied by a pleasant sensation			1
some experts think it is caused by a lack of blood to the brain , which sets it into ‘ panic mode ’ and it produces vivid visions as it fights to survive			2
a study of heart attack patients by @entity155 , however , contradicted the notion that lack of oxygen is responsible for @entity159			0
the research team studied 63 survivors of a cardiac arrest who were resuscitated at @entity164 after they had been clinically dead with no pulse , no respiration and fixed dilated pupils			0
and those who reported to have a true @entity18 during the ordeal were actually found to have had higher oxygen levels than those who had n’t .			2
