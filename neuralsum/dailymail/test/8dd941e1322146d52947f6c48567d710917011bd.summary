a pregnant meteorologist has called out the bullies who viciously attacked her appearance by reading their hateful messages on air - before admitting that their cruel words had taken their toll on her			1
@entity7 , of @entity9 's news channel @entity8 , was joined by her fellow anchors @entity11 and @entity12 as they reflected upon the degrading comments the mom has received about her second pregnancy on an episode of the online - only news segment @entity18 - with her reading some of the message aloud			1
' nowhere on @entity21 have we seen a weather reader so gross as you ( sic ) , ' @entity7 read from one of the messages			1
' your front end looks like the @entity28 and rear end a brick - fill in the blank - house			2
cover up or take time off			2
' @entity7 , who is due to give birth in three months , explained that she received the harsh message the day before she taped the march 26 segment and admitted that it ' kicked off a bit of a conversation '			1
she and her co-anchors laughed the comments off , particularly the group 's misspelling of the word @entity8			1
' first of all , if you are going to diss us , please learn how to spell , ' @entity12 noted , before he explained that @entity8 is spelled with an @entity56 - not an ' e ' like the group had written			1
and while they joked about the bizarre jibe , it was n't the only scathing message @entity7 had received regarding her pregnancy and her wardrobe			1
' buy some decent clothes and have more respect for your unborn child			0
you 're not the first pregnant woman @entity71 , ' another critic had written			0
someone else advised her : ' looser tops would look much more professional			0
' @entity76 words : @entity7 , who can be seen giving a weather report , was also criticized for wearing form - fitting clothing because ' looser tops would look more professional ' after @entity7 finished reading the messages , @entity12 joked : ' haters gon na hate as some rapper may have said , ' before @entity11 interjected : ' @entity83 , i think actually said that			1
' @entity7 revealed that she was actually expecting these types of messages because she had received a similar level of hateful jibes during her first pregnancy			1
refusing to cover up and hide her pregnant body however , she stood up to show her growing baby bump and said : ' you ca n't really hide something like this			0
' ' i feel like i am pretty confident person , ' she added			0
' i would n't be in this industry if i was n't			0
i do n't feel that this is really affecting me or has affected me			2
' but @entity7 went on to say that , subconsciously , her critics ' hurtful words had gotten to her			1
that night she found herself checking her own reflection in the mirror to see how big her baby bump had grown			0
she asked her husband if she looked bigger than she had thought , and when went to bed that night , she realized it was her critics ' harsh words that were driving her actions			1
@entity7 noted : ' it 's amazing when you say something mean about someone , it still affects them			1
' baby bumps : @entity7 posed for this funny photo in the green room at @entity118 family time : @entity7 and her husband @entity120 can be seen sitting in the crowed with their son @entity121 ' even if you are joking , it sinks in at some level , ' she continued			2
' i was not impressed with myself when i got into bed yesterday and thought about what i had done through the evening hours			0
it obviously had affected me			2
the day after the online segment aired , @entity7 wrote about her account on the @entity118 website			1
she first thanked fans who reached out to her to share their outrage over the feedback she has received throughout her pregnancy			0
' for those of you emailing to say i look great and to keep my head up — thank you ! please also share a kind comment to the person next to you , ' @entity7 wrote			2
she went on to thank ' @entity42 ' who wrote her such a vicious letter because it taught her an important lesson			0
' no matter how rational or confident you are , the mean things people say can have an impact , ' she explained			0
' the negative thoughts seep in when you do n’t even realize it			0
even a little joking comment could do some damage			0
hopefully this can help us all be more aware of our impact on others			0
