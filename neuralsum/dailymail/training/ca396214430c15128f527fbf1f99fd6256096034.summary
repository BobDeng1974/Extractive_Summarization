by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 05:53 est , 30 july 2012 a convention centre , sports stadium and performing arts complex are among the landmark projects planned for a new - look @entity5 after the city was levelled by an earthquake last year			1
essentially given a blank slate , government planners today unveiled a blueprint for @entity12 's oldest city that replaces office towers with green spaces , urban apartments and innovation ' hubs '			1
under the plan , which is hoped will give the city the feel of a college campus , its area will be smaller , with new buildings lower in height and built with better earthquake protection			1
@entity27 and bright : this design concept distributed by @entity5 council shows the futuristic new look planned for the @entity12 city after it was devastated by earthquakes last year campus vibe : the plan for a revived @entity5 includes better use of green spaces and an overall design that would give more emphasis to the @entity39 which winds through the city it is nearly 18 months since the magnitude - 6.1 earthquake struck , killing 185 people and irreparably damaging 1,400 buildings , including the century - old @entity46 cathedral in the city centre			1
' it will be safe , modern , green and will leave a legacy that makes @entity5 one of the best places in the world to live and work for many generations to come , ' said the city 's mayor , @entity54			1
the plan has been eagerly awaited , with many residents becoming frustrated at the slow pace of recovery			0
hundreds of substantial aftershocks have hampered progress and made insurers wary , while government and city officials , including mayor @entity54 , have been accused of dithering and bickering			2
ambitious : this computer generated view shows the concept for the @entity5 's new stadium , seating up to 35,000 people , to be built in the city 's south - east new amenities : this image shows the design of the planned new sports centre , which will be situated in south - west @entity5 quality of life : according to the plan the central city square , shown here , would be divided into a number of smaller public gathering spots culture : a new convention centre with the capacity to hold 2,000 people would overlook the river , according to the blueprint the planned @entity89 : under the plan , the new - look @entity5 would be bordered with green spaces a river runs through it : this plan shows how the @entity39 will become a central part of the new layout of @entity5 @entity97 and new : this computer - generated image shows how planners intend to fuse modernity with @entity12 's @entity102 cultural heritage even before the plan was released , some wondered if they would end up footing a chunk of the bill through rate hikes			1
yet for many , the plan is a welcome step forward			0
some see it as a unique chance to correct problems in the city , such as an excess of older - style office space that was evident even before the earthquake			2
the plan also comes as the aftershocks appear to be finally abating			0
however , @entity12 government officials have not yet identified an overall cost for the rebuild or specific funding sources for all the new projects			2
@entity124 , a spokesman for earthquake recovery minister @entity125 , said that funding will come from a variety of sources , including local councils , private investors , insurance payouts and from the central government , which has so far set aside 5.5billion @entity12 dollars ( £ 2.8billion ) for the recovery efforts			1
devastation : rescue workers look for victims on the collapsed @entity138 building after the devastating earthquake struck in february last year desperate : rescue workers search for survivors through debris in central @entity5 after the earthquake struck 5km below the surface smashed : a bus covered in building debris in @entity5 gutted : the earthquake damaged @entity147 in @entity5 crumbling : a building 's side is caved in at the side of a street in @entity5 @entity152 : apocalyptic scenes in @entity5 were reminiscent of 9/11 rubble : the city 's iconic cathedral of the @entity156 lost its steeple in the quake which measured 6.3 on the @entity160 scale under the plan , the city would be bordered with green spaces and the overall design would give more emphasis to the winding @entity39			1
an earthquake memorial would be given prominence , as would a @entity102 cultural centre			0
the central city square would be divided into a number of smaller public gathering spots			0
the city would be broken into a series of hubs featuring related activities			0
for instance , there would be a health precinct anchored by a hospital , a justice precinct with courts and a police station , and a retail precinct with shops			0
the plan identifies sites for big infrastructure projects including a prominent library and a convention centre with the capacity to hold 2,000 people that would overlook the river			0
there would also be a covered sports stadium seating up to 35,000 people built in the city 's south - east and an indoor aquatic and recreation centre built in the south - west			2
@entity12 prime minister @entity199 , who grew up in @entity5 , said it was important to identify sites for the major new projects so that private developers could begin planning hotels , restaurants and shopping areas to complement them			2
' i am delighted to see this plan for new development and to know that construction will soon be underway to rebuild my old hometown , ' he said .			0
