by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 3 september 2013 the @entity2 ’s new aircraft carriers could set sail without a crucial radar which warns commanders of incoming enemy warplanes and missiles			1
a damning report by @entity9 reveals the @entity11 early warning system will not be ready until six years after the first of the £ 5.5billion queen elizabeth - class warships enters service in 2016			1
delays in fitting the ‘ eyes in the sky ’ system to military helicopters until 2022 were a ‘ concern ’ , the @entity16 ’ @entity15 ( @entity15 ) says today			0
concern : new aircraft carriers the @entity24 and @entity25 , shown in this artist 's impression , may be vulnerable to aerial attack this risks leaving @entity24 and @entity25 without aerial coverage and vulnerable to attack when they are put to sea			1
the 65,000 - tonne floating fortresses are due to be fully operational from 2020 meaning they could be deployed to trouble spots around the world			0
last time the @entity2 did not have an airborne early warning system was in place was during the @entity42 conflict in 1982 when five ships were sunk , with dozens of service personnel killed and hundreds injured			1
the cross-party committee - @entity46 ’s spending watchdog - also warns the cost of the aircraft carriers could spiral ‘ uncontrollably ’			1
the bill for the two new warships , given the green light in 2008 , is almost twice the original £ 3.6billion - and there are ‘ huge risks ’ it will increase further , says the report			0
@entity9 heap criticism on the @entity57 for wasting money after a u-turn over the type of warplanes to fly from the aircraft carriers			1
in 2010 ministers controversially decided to scrap the last @entity66 government ’s plans to buy a fleet of jump jets , which take off and land vertically			1
instead , prime minister @entity70 ordered conventional versions of the @entity73 - built @entity72 that would need catapults and arrester gear to take off from and land on the vessels			0
on target : defence secretary @entity79 says that @entity80 is expected to be working by the first operational service but this was based on ‘ deeply flawed information ’ , say the committee			1
when the cost of fitting the ships with ‘ cats and traps ’ more than doubled to £ 2billion , mr @entity70 flip - flopped and returned to buying the jump jet			2
the move cost a staggering £ 74million in squandered in lost man hours , administrative costs and needless planning			2
@entity66 mp @entity94 , the @entity15 ’s chairman , said : ‘ @entity95 is still not convinced that the @entity96 has this programme under control			2
it remains subject to huge technical and commercial risks , with the potential for further uncontrolled growth in costs			0
’ defence secretary @entity79 said : ‘ @entity102 is expected to deliver an initial capability by the time the first carrier is in operational service			2
‘ maritime surveillance will also be provided by other platforms and systems			0
’ he said the @entity96 ‘ acted swiftly ’ to switch back to the jump jet as soon as it became clear ‘ the alternative would cost more money ’			0
the @entity57 left @entity112 without carrier strike when it controversially scrapped the iconic harrier jump jets in 2010 as part of defence cuts			0
@entity66 defence spokesman @entity117 said : ‘ the chaos of the government ’s carrier u-turn gets worse and worse			0
‘ @entity70 has cost the taxpayer millions of pounds and has left the country without aircraft on an aircraft carrier for a decade			1
when defence budgets are tight , this looks incompetent and wasteful			0

@entity24 and @entity25 risk entering service without aerial coverage and vulnerable to attack when they are put to sea
@entity46 ’s spending watchdog also warns the cost of the aircraft carriers could spiral ' uncontrollably '
