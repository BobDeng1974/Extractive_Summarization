a scientist has warned @entity1 is facing a collapse in society similar to ancient @entity4 - because we 've lived too peacefully for too long			1
@entity7 historian dr @entity6 claims @entity1 today have lost the drive for innovation that epitomised the @entity11 era as we enjoy a more comfortable standard of living			1
he has drawn parallels between modern - day @entity1 and @entity15 in @entity4 - when the city was at its most powerful as it captured more land overseas and greater wealth poured into the centre			2
historian dr @entity6 has drawn a parallel between the @entity22 in @entity15 - when @entity23 , pictured , was ruler - and @entity25 today , warning this country is heading for a similar collapse in society dr @entity6 ( left ) has suggested @entity1 have lost the biological drive for innovation that helped huge social , economic and industrial changes during the @entity11 era , ruled over by @entity32 ( right ) however over subsequent centuries there was a rise in social divisions , inequality and political tensions - which resulted in its demise			1
making the comparison dr @entity6 said : ' it was a time when democracy was moving towards despotism and in @entity1 we are now see that politics is becoming much more about individuals rather than political parties			1
the two - party system has started to break down ' , @entity50 reports			0
' we live in a golden age where there have been no major wars in @entity55 for three quarters of a century			0

people no longer want to join the @entity101 , or become engineers			2
people would rather do arts degrees			0

dr @entity6 argues @entity1 people have lived too peacefully to innovate
rising inequality and division will lead to a collapse in society , he warns
*adaption* of genes means we are less aggressive or likely to go to war
