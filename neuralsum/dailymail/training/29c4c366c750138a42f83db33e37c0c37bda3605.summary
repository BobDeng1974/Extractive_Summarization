by @entity1 reporter published : 07:44 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 07:56 est , 9 october 2012 a trainee lawyer has racked up £ 350,000 in legal bills pursuing damages after being injured by a sun lounger on a luxury cruise ship			1
now @entity7 , 22 , is pleading with senior judges to save her from financial ruin after her eight - year battle with @entity12			1
she was aged 14 during the £ 20,000 @entity14 cruise on the liner @entity16 when she claimed a sun lounger was caught by a gust of wind and flew into her			1
happier memories : @entity7 and her mother @entity22 aboard the @entity12 cruise ship @entity16 at christmas 2003 - days before she was allegedly hit by a sun lounger miss @entity7 sued the company after returning home from the trip with her grandparents and mother @entity22 , 40			1
at first it was thought she had escaped with only a soft tissue injury but her family claims that her life has been blighted since by crippling chronic pain syndrome			0
earlier in the court saga that has lasted since 2004 , @entity12 admitted liability and offered her £ 2,000 to settle the claim			1
miss @entity7 , of @entity37 , @entity38 , turned this down and went on to seek substantial damages			1
her fortunes reversed in 2008 when a judge allowed @entity12 to withdraw its admission after fresh evidence about weather conditions on the day of the accident			1
the judge ruled that her damages claim had ‘ no reasonable prospect of success ’ after the testimony of a wind speed expert			2
miss @entity7 has run out of funds to pay lawyers but fought on with the help of her grandfather @entity56 , 74 , and his wife @entity57 , 65			2
the cruise liner @entity16 pictured in @entity59 : the alleged incident occurred when the wind lifted an on - board sun lounger despite having no legal training , mr @entity56 appeared at the @entity64 in @entity65 to plead her case			2
he asked mr justice @entity68 to resurrect miss @entity7 ’s claim and spare her the mammoth costs bill			1
the judge warned mr @entity56 : ‘ if you lose this case , they ’ll probably make your granddaughter bankrupt			2
you are out of your depth			0
’ mr @entity56 continued , telling him : ‘ it is important we win for @entity7 because she is studying to become a solicitor and we do n’t want her to have a black mark against her			1
’ he asked the judge to send his granddaughter ’s damages claim back for re-hearing and to look again at the huge bill for legal costs			2
mr @entity56 pleaded : ‘ it is so unfair when it is not her fault			0
’ he told how the family set off on their dream holiday for three weeks over christmas 2003 and @entity93 2004 , taking in 18 countries			0
the accident with the sun lounger happened on the 12th or 13th deck of the liner as it lay off the coast of @entity100 in the @entity101 in early 2004 , said mr @entity56			0
the judge ruled that miss @entity7 ’s damages claim could not be revived but he did grant an adjournment			1
he said this would allow mr @entity56 to seek legal advice and obtain documents relating to the costs , £ 7,500 of which falls on him			2
the judge said : ‘ it is important that mr @entity56 has a fair chance to prove his case on behalf of his granddaughter			0
’ outside court , mrs @entity115 said the cruise should have been ‘ the holiday of a lifetime ’			0
she said her granddaughter had been left in ‘ excruciating pain ’ but added : ‘ she is studying to be a solicitor and she ’s doing very well			0
’ a @entity125 spokesman said : ' mr @entity56 , on behalf of his granddaughter , has pursued this spurious case over many years despite warnings that he would be liable for his costs when he lost			0
' @entity129 decided that the evidence showed that the accident could not possibly have occurred in any of the various ways alleged			0
the @entity64 therefore refused mr @entity56 permission to continue with the case to trial			0
' @entity125 has incurred over £ 200,000 in lawyers costs defending this claim , which the @entity64 found mr @entity56 and @entity7 were liable to pay			1
@entity125 can confirm it has not threatened to make @entity138 bankrupt			0

trainee lawyer @entity7 was 14 when she was injured on @entity12 ferry
legal battle has continued for eight years despite @entity12 *previously* admitting liability and offering to settle for £ 2,000
grandparents appear in court to ask judge to spare her from £ 350,000 bills
