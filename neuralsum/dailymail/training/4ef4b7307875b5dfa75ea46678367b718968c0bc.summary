the @entity7 midfielder is off the back of his best season yet , having scored 16 goals last year despite being sidelined for three months with a thigh injury			1
one of those goals was the extra-time winner in the @entity15 final over @entity16 , which ended @entity18 's nine - year wait for a trophy , and the 23 - year - old was glad to prove the doubters wrong			1
' i 've had a bit of everything so it was nice to have a good season , score the number of goals that i did and be recognised a lot more			2
' i 've always believed in myself and what i can do , and i think a lot of people realised that last year and that 's what i 'm more happy about			0
' @entity18 and his team appeared in good spirits as they were put through their paces on wednesday			0
the @entity63 boss , having captured the @entity65 forward @entity64 from @entity66 for Â£ 30million last week , took to @entity7 's training base at @entity68			1
