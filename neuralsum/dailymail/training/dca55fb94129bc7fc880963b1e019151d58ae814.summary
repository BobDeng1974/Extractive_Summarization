by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 09:23 est , 28 september 2012 @entity2 ’s £ 600 million fruit industry is on high alert - after a tiny @entity5 fruit fly that devastates crops was found for the first time in this country			1
growers of soft fruits like strawberries , raspberries , blackberries and blueberries are being warned the pest is probably already attacking crops here			1
the spotted wing vinegar fly is just 2 - 3mm long but can also pose a threat to harder fruit like apples and pears			1
the tiny @entity5 fruit fly - the spotted wing vinegar fly known as drosophila suzukii - devastates soft fruit crops			1
it has been found in @entity27			0
the particularly nasty pest wrecked £ 300 million worth of crops in @entity30 alone the first year it was discovered there			1
five flies were found in raspberry and blackberry plots at fruit trial centre @entity35 in @entity27 earlier this month			1
but experts warn that the pest , which is rife in continental @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity5 , is probably already widespread here too			0
in many countries it is suspected that the fly arrived up to three years before damage was first seen in crops			1
once established , the pesky insect has proven impossible to eradicate and growers are being urged to look out for infestations			1
other fruit at risk include blackcurrants , redcurrants , gooseberries , cherries , peaches , nectarines , plums , grapes and tomatoes			1
unlike common fruit flies that attack rotting fruit , the spotted wing also attacks developing fruits on the plant			1
@entity2 's £ 600m fruit industry is on red alert after the pest was spotted in @entity27			1
it has proved impossible to eradicate elsewhere in the world			0
the fruit is quickly spoiled as the female bores through its skin to lay eggs			1
when they hatch , maggots gnaw through the rest of the fruit and it falls , wasted , to the ground			1
females can lay up to 60 eggs per day and 13 generations of the insect can hatch in a single year			2
dr @entity85 , an entomologist at @entity86 , said : ' the trouble with this species is it ’ll lay its eggs when the fruit is actually ripening , so obviously that has massive consequences for the fruit			2
' there could be punnets with larvae in and you might not know they are there			0
' the fly , known as drosophila suzukii , originated in south - east @entity5 but reached the @entity102 in 2008 , @entity103 in 2009 and @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 in 2010			0
adult flies are brownish - yellow with black bands on the abdomen , up to 3mm long with bright red eyes			0
the fly is easy to spot due to its red eyes and black bands on its body with distinctive red eyes , the insects are easy to spot			0
dr @entity85 said that the flies have had a ' massive impact ' on grower practices in affected countries			0
they have had to spray crops with pesticides more often and wait longer before harvesting			2
the @entity126 , which advises fruit growers , has put out a briefing note warning them about the grim discovery at @entity86			2
it said : ' adult flies have been identified both in wild blackberry and raspberry breeding plots on site			0
' @entity135 is an aggressive pest of berry and stone fruits			0
' experience in @entity40 and @entity39 has shown it spreads very rapidly both in commercial crops and in wild hosts , especially wild blackberry			2
the flies are often used in experiments because they breed so quickly ' it is therefore very probably widespread in the @entity2 and already attacking vulnerable crops , though the extent of its spread is currently unknown			1
' it is vital that routine weekly monitoring of berry fruit crops at risk - especially raspberry , blackberry and blueberry - is started as soon as possible			1
' monitoring for both larvae and adults is recommended but monitoring for larvae is crucially important to avoid the risk of infested fruit being sent to market			2
the fly , known as drosophila suzukii , originated in south - east @entity5 but reached the @entity102 in 2008 , @entity103 in 2009 and @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 in 2010			0
adult flies are brownish - yellow with black bands on the abdomen , up to 3mm long with bright red eyes			0
females can lay up to 60 eggs per day and 13 generations of the insect can hatch in a single year			2
' in the event that the pest is found , a programme of weekly sprays should be implemented as soon as possible			0
' the government ’s @entity176 ( @entity177 ) admitted that drastic measures like quarantine areas and compulsory destruction of crops have been ruled out			2
@entity177 ’s @entity183 said : ' once the pest is here , eradication would be impossible as the flies breed and spread very quickly			0
' very stringent statutory requirements on growers like destruction of crops would be needed , which would be seen as disproportionate and so eradication is not a realistic prospect			2
' in the @entity102 , growers suffered losses of up to 80 per cent of their crops depending on location and fruit			1
the @entity30 fruit industry lost £ 300 million due to pest damage in 2008 , the first year it was seen in the state			1
@entity201 grows strawberries , raspberries , blackberries , apples , pears and plums for supply to the major supermarket chains			1
his 250 - hectare @entity210 in @entity211 , @entity27 , is close to where the flies were found			0
he said : ' we should be concerned , though so far it ’s an unknown quantity			0
' we will try to keep the crops clean , so as not to leave them open to infestation , and take all the advice we can from the experts			0
' industry body @entity221 represents suppliers of around 90 per cent of all berries supplied to the @entity2 ’s leading supermarkets			1
the @entity221 ’s @entity226 said : ' there is absolutely no need for consumers to be alarmed , @entity225 does not pose any food safety risk or any risk to consumer ’s health			0
' @entity234 and our growers have been and will continue to be vigilant in monitoring evidence of its existence			0
' a great deal has been learnt from the @entity102 on monitoring , chemical control and hygiene which is being communicated to the industry and it is possible to control it effectively			0

tiny insect could decimate fruit industry , affecting everything from strawberries to apples
@entity253 has already wrecked *$* 300m of crops in @entity30 , and has been spotted in the @entity2
