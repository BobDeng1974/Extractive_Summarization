in return , the boss of the @entity14 secret service may have persuaded author @entity16 not to pension off his most famous creation at the height of his popularity			0
@entity14 spy chiefs developed their own version of two @entity7 devices it had seen , one used by 007 in @entity25 , the other used by one of his enemies in @entity29			1
if it 's good enough for 007 ... @entity4 bosses copied gadget ideas from @entity7 books and films for its own secret agents in the @entity10 and @entity11 , including this tracking device featured in @entity25 the first is the pocket size , magnetic tracking device which , in the film , @entity37 subtly slips into the boot of @entity25 's @entity40 to track him down after their golf match			1
the second is the spring loaded poison - tipped blades which flick out from the shoes of villainess @entity47 as she tries to stab @entity7 in @entity29			0
the revelations come from newly declassified letters between @entity7 author @entity16 and @entity4 chief @entity51 , as well as published interviews with the legendary @entity14 spymaster			1
and it suggests that the @entity14 successfully managed to produce their own version of @entity47 's blades but were not so successful in making a goldfinger - style tracking device			1
ironically , both were used at the height of the @entity60 when there was very little love from @entity63 towards the @entity64			0
spiky : the @entity14 foreign intelligence agency also made its own version of the spring loaded poison - tipped blades which flick out from the shoes of villainess @entity47 as she tries to stab @entity7 in from @entity63 with @entity70 the letters and interviews have been analysed by dr @entity73 of the @entity74 for the specialist publication @entity75			1
and they reveal the relationship between @entity16 and @entity51 mirrored the warm friendship between @entity7 and his fictional @entity4 buddy @entity80 in many of the books and films			1
the two got on so well that @entity51 even managed to persuade @entity16 to use his books to boost the @entity4 's image around the world , something which was also seen in the films			2
pen pals : @entity4 chief @entity51 , left , and @entity7 author @entity16 , right , regularly communicated by letter , with the writer even telling the spymaster he needed to come up with more gadgets to fight the @entity63 dr @entity73 said : ' there was a surprising two - way influence between the @entity4 and the @entity7 novels during the @entity60 , stemming from the mutual admiration between @entity51 and @entity16			1
' this ranged from the copying of devices , such as the poison - tipped dagger shoe in @entity29 , to the agency using the 007 novels to improve its public profile			0
' it 's even more striking that this was going on at time when mentioning the @entity4 was strictly off - limits for the @entity14 media and cultural establishment , whereas @entity16 , as a @entity113 author , could say what he liked			2
' for a long time , the @entity7 books had a monopoly on the @entity4 's public image and the agency used this to its advantage			0
' @entity16 and @entity51 communicated regularly by letter			0
@entity51 was a fan of the novels and also spoke about them warmly in published interviews with magazines			0
one letter shows @entity130 not to pension bond off in 1963 , just a year after the release of the first 007 movie , dr no , had made the character a worldwide sensation			0
another has @entity16 telling @entity51 that the @entity4 needed to come up with more gadgets and devices if it wanted to take a lead in the @entity60 .			2
