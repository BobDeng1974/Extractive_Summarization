about 9,000 @entity0 stationed on the @entity2 island of @entity3 will be moved to the @entity5 territory of @entity6 and other locations in the @entity8 , including @entity9 , under a @entity5 - @entity2 agreement announced yesterday			1
the move is part of a broader arrangement designed to ease tensions in the countries ' defense alliance , which stem in part from opposition to the @entity5 presence on the island			1
it also reflects a desire by the @entity24 administration to spread @entity5 forces more widely in the @entity8 , as @entity5 rebalances its defence priorities after a decade of war in the @entity28			2
moving out : around 9,000 @entity0 stationed on the @entity2 island of @entity3 are to be relocated under a new @entity5 - @entity2 agreement the agreement was outlined in a joint statement issued last night by secretary of state @entity32 and defense secretary @entity33 , and their @entity2 counterparts			1
citing an ' increasingly uncertain security environment ' in the @entity8 , they said their agreement was intended to maintain a robust @entity5 military presence to ensure the defence of @entity2			2
@entity3 : the sub-tropical island is home to around half of the @entity5 troops stationed in @entity2 territories ' @entity2 is not just a close ally , but also a close friend , ' mr @entity33 said			1
' i look forward to deepening that friendship and strengthening our partnership as , together , we address security challenges in the region			0
' as yet , there has been no indication of when the 9,000 @entity0 will leave @entity3			2
according to the joint statement , their departure will come ' when appropriate facilities are available to receive them ' on @entity6 and elsewhere			2
allies : @entity5 defence secretary @entity33 said @entity2 was ' not just a close ally , but also a close friend ' to @entity5 under the new agreement , about 10,000 @entity0 will remain on @entity3 , which has been a key element of the @entity5 military presence in @entity8 for decades			1
the @entity5 also has a substantial @entity66 presence on the island			1
@entity2 's foreign minister @entity68 said the country wanted to ' reduce the burden on @entity3 , ' adding , ' i think we have made some progress and this plan offers specific and forward - looking action			0
' @entity2 and its territories are central to @entity5 's strategy for deterring aggression in the region , and for reinforcing the @entity80 in the event of a @entity83 attack on @entity84			2
the @entity24 administration believes the new agreement with @entity2 will make the alliance more sustainable , while also giving the @entity0 more regional flexibility			2
between 4,700 and 5,000 @entity0 will relocate from @entity3 to @entity6 , while the remainder of the 9,000 will be transferred to @entity9 or be part of a rotational presence in @entity93 and elsewhere in the region			1
earlier this week , governor of hawaii @entity95 said he expects around 2,700 @entity0 will be moved there			0
the cost of relocating @entity0 to @entity6 is expected to be around $ 8.6 billion , and defence officials claim @entity2 will pay $ 3.1 billion of this			1
the total cost includes an unspecified amount for possible construction of new training ranges in the @entity105 that could be used jointly by @entity5 and @entity2 forces			1
controversial : the transfer of @entity0 from @entity3 to @entity6 has been in limbo for years because of issues surrounding the @entity5 air base @entity110 the agreement also calls for a phased return to @entity2 control of certain parcels of land on @entity3 which are presently used by the @entity5 military			1
the shift of @entity0 from @entity3 to @entity6 has been in limbo for years because it was linked to the closure and replacement of @entity110			1
@entity122 fiercely oppose the existence of @entity110 , and believe the base should be closed and a replacement established overseas or elsewhere in @entity2			0
the @entity5 , however , has insisted that @entity2 should find a @entity110 replacement on @entity3			0
for now , the dispute remains unresolved			0
the accord was timed for completion before @entity2 prime minster @entity131 's scheduled visit to @entity132 on monday for talks with president @entity24			0
the @entity5 military presence on @entity3 has been a cause of historic tension between @entity5 and @entity2			0
many of the island 's residents view the troops as a cause of congestion and increased crime			0
much of the bad feeling has its roots in the 1995 kidnapping and rape of a 12 - year - old @entity2 girl by three @entity5 servicemen			2
@entity151 seaman @entity150 and @entity5 @entity0 @entity152 and @entity153 kidnapped the schoolgirl before beating her , duct taping her eyes shut and raping her			1
@entity157 pleaded guilty to the rape , and the other two men pleaded guilty to conspiracy			0
a @entity2 judge sentenced @entity157 and @entity152 to seven years ' imprisonment , while @entity153 received six and a half years			0
the men were released in 2003 , and dishonourably discharged from the @entity5 military			0
unsurprisingly , the incident provoked a public outcry , and the people of @entity3 placed a full - page advert in the @entity168 condemning the rape and other aspects of the @entity5 presence on their island			1
although top @entity5 government officials publicly apologised for the crime , tensions continued to brew and the incident remains fresh in the minds of many			0
dishonourably discharged : ( from left ) @entity152 , @entity150 , and @entity153			0

@entity0 will relocate to @entity9 and the @entity5 territory of @entity6 - but 10,000 will stay on the island
move will cost an estimated $ 8.6 billion
