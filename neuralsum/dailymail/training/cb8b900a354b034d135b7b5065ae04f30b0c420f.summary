by @entity0 last updated at 8:06 pm on 18th january 2012 a high school cheerleader who says she woke up from a nap stricken with @entity4 's - like symptoms is speaking out for the first time - and demanding answers from the @entity6			1
seventeen - year - old @entity9 , appearing with her friend , @entity7 , 16 , on @entity8 , said she started the school year off like any other			1
but her life dramatically changed the evening of october 7			1
the teenagers are among 12 girls at @entity14 suffering suddenly from a mysterious disorder , which causes them to shake and tic uncontrollably			1
doctors today said the outbreak of @entity4 's was most likely caused by a rare ' conversion disorder ' otherwise known as mass hysteria			2
conversion disorder can occur after a stressful and event and often also include numbness or blindess - but the exact cause is not known			2
the girls and their mothers appeared on the programme , insisting the @entity36 is n't giving them clear answers			1
their daughters , close friends , described how their active school lives have been completely crippled by the onset of symptoms , including stuttering and verbal outbursts			1
' i used to cheer every day , ' miss @entity9 said			2
' i used to go to two art classes every day			2
now i 'm not in school			1
' those things she says now are nearly impossible			2
' i 'm very angry , i 'm very frustrated , no one 's giving answers , ' she continued			1
miss @entity7 shares her frustration , and she said her family has not received any testing data from the school or the @entity6 explaining how 12 girls at the the same school were suddenly stricken with similar symptoms			1
bright future : miss @entity9 said she was on her high school cheer squad and on the honour roll before she woke up on october 7 stuttering frustrated : @entity7 , 16 , is one of the 12 girls suffering sudden uncontrollable outbursts and tics concerned : ( from @entity66 ) @entity67 , her daughter , @entity7 , and @entity69 , with her daughter , @entity65 , demanded answers on the @entity8 ' i 'm angry too , ' she said			1
' i ca n't explain it			2
they told us it was traumatic			2
but i do n't really think any of us had that traumatic of a life before and that it would randomly happen			2
' miss @entity9 's mother , @entity69 , said she is not satisfied with what the doctors or school administrators have told her			1
' when these started , i was fine			2
i felt good about everything , i was on honour roll			2
there was nothing going wrong			2
and then i just woke up and that 's when the stuttering started			0
' - @entity9 , 17 ' nothing 's been collectively done for our daughters			0
everything 's been done individually			0
testing that they say all of the girls have had , they have not had			0
the facts that they 're stating just are not true , ' she said			0
miss @entity9 and miss @entity7 are each getting private treatment from their doctors			0
and while miss @entity7 says her symptoms have improved , they want more answers from the @entity24 @entity6 , which says each student was examined and given a diagnoses			1
a spokesman for the agency told @entity109 the investigation did not reveal environmental or infectious causes as the origin of the girls ' illness			1
miss @entity9 told @entity115 on the @entity8 she was told her condition was stress - induced			0
but she denied feeling extreme stress on the onset			0
' when these started , i was fine			0
i was perfectly fine , ' she said , referring to her verbal outbursts			0
' i felt good about everything , i was on honour roll			0
there was nothing going wrong			0
and then i just woke up and that 's when the stuttering started			0
' questions linger : an investigation by the @entity130 @entity6 did not reveal environmental or infectious causes at @entity14 as the origin expert : dr @entity134 , with the @entity130 @entity6 , said he is unable to disclose what the cause of the symptoms are due to privacy laws unlike @entity7 , she said her condition has since gotten worse			1
school administrators have insisted it is not a case of mass hysteria and that none of the girls are making the illness or symptoms up			1
@entity4 's syndrome affects the body 's brain and nervous system by causing tics - repeated , uncontrollable movements or involuntary vocal sounds			0
last week , the school held a forum for concerned parents			1
about 150 people attended , demanding to know what was wrong with the students			1
' i ca n't explain it			0
they told us it was traumatic			0
but i do n't really think any of us had that traumatic of a life before and that it would randomly happen			0
' - @entity7 , 16 dr @entity134 , with the @entity130 @entity6 , said : ' i can assure you these children have all been seen by professionals that have come up with answers and they are all being treated and they 're actually doing pretty well			1
' he revealed that tics like this can be caused by a number of factors such as genetics , head trauma , drugs for adhd and ocd and antihistamines			0
through tests over the last few months , they have been able to rule out a number of environmental factors , infections , illegal drugs and carbon monoxide poisoning			0
@entity191 reported the @entity192 in @entity193 has been consulted , along with @entity194 , as well as the @entity195 and the @entity196			0
dr @entity134 assured parents that these cases have been seen nationwide and they come and go in individuals			1
he said that stress and anxiety can make them worse			0
but most parents were left frustrated due to @entity206 ( federal health privacy laws ) which meant the doctors were limited in telling them what was causing the symptoms			1
because of this and the limited number of cases in the small community , dr @entity134 said their hands were tied as they can not comment on children 's diagnosis			0
he said some of the students were already showing signs of improvement			1

federal privacy laws *prevent* school , @entity130 @entity6 from disclosing cause of illness
students and parents demanding answers
*unsatisfied* with how issue is being handled
