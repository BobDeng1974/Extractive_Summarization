by @entity0 for the @entity1 elderly people may struggle to sleep as well as they did during their youth because they start to lose part of the brain that helps them ‘ switch off ’ , scientists believe			1
researchers have identified a group of cells which blocks off conscious thoughts , allowing us to sleep			1
they think these inhibitory neurons are gradually eroded as we age , leading to greater sleep problems in later life			1
professor @entity30 , who led the research published in the journal @entity33 , said : ‘ on average , a person in his 70s has about one hour less sleep per night than a person in his 20s			0
‘ the loss of these neurons with ageing and with alzheimer ’s disease may be an important reason why older individuals often face sleep disruptions			1
researchers have identified a group of cells in the brain which block off conscious thoughts , allowing us to sleep ‘ these results may therefore lead to new methods to diminish sleep problems in the elderly			1
’ he added : ‘ sleep loss and sleep fragmentation is associated with a number of health issues , including cognitive dysfunction , increased blood pressure and vascular disease , and a tendency to develop type 2 diabetes			0
‘ it now appears that loss of these neurons may be contributing to these various disorders as people age			2
’ professor @entity30 ’s team discovered a group of neurons – the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus – was functioning as a sleep switch in rats			1
they then found the same process was happening in humans			0
the cells turned off the brain ’s arousal systems to enable the animals to fall asleep			2
professor @entity30 said : ‘ our experiments in animals showed that loss of these neurons produced profound insomnia , with animals sleeping only about 50 per cent as much as normal and their remaining sleep being fragmented and disrupted			2
’ a group of inhibitor cells in the human brain is found in a similar location and has the same chemical make - up as that found in rats			2
the researchers analysed data from 45 elderly people who had donated their brains to science and had agreed to wear movement sensors to monitor how well they slept , from the age of 65 until their death at an average age of 89			0
examining the brains , the scientists found people with fewer neurons in the ‘ sleep switch ’ area were more likely to have sleepless nights			0
professor @entity30 said : ‘ the fewer the neurons , the more fragmented the sleep became			0
’ for those with the fewest inhibitor cells , less than 40 per cent of their time in bed was spent in extended periods of sleep .			0

group of cells in brain which block off conscious thoughts identified
these neurons are gradually eroded as we age , leading to sleep problems
same process may be seen @entity26 ’s *patients* , who suffer disrupted sleep
