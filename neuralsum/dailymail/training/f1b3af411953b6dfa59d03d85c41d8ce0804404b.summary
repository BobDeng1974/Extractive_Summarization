archaeologists have found a complete 3,200 - year - old skeleton , pictured , with cancer			2
the find could help show how the disease has evolved archaeologists have found a complete 3,200 - year - old skeleton with cancer and say the discovery could help show how the disease has evolved			1
the remains of the wealthy man , believed to have been between 25 and 35 when he died , were found in a tomb close to the @entity12 in @entity13 last year			1
the bones showed evidence of metastatic carcinoma - cancer which has spread from where it started			1
analysis proved it came from a malignant soft - tissue tumour and spread across large parts of the body , making it the oldest ‘ convincing ’ example of metastatic cancer ever found , the authors of the study said			1
researchers from @entity28 and the @entity29 said the discovery will help to explore underlying causes of cancer in ancient times and provide insights into the evolution of cancer in the past			1
although it is one of the leading causes of death today , it is extremely rare in archaeological finds compared to other detectable killers			0
this has led scientists to conclude cancer is a product of modern lifestyles and increased longevity , but the discovery shows cancer did exist in the @entity12 in 1200 bc. @entity50 the lead author from @entity28 's @entity52 , said : ‘ this may help us to understand the almost unknown history of the disease			2
the sternum of the skeleton , believed to have belonged to a man aged between 25 and 35 , pictured , shows evidence of cancer , highlighted by the arrows researchers found the bones at the @entity66 site , 750km ( 466 miles ) , marked at @entity67 , dr @entity62 said : ' from footprints left on wet mud floors , to the healed fractures of many ancient inhabitants , @entity66 offers a unique insight into what it was like to live there - and die - 3,200 years ago ' metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread around the body			1
carcinoma is the most common form of cancer to occur in humans but it ’s origin can not always be determined			0
the metastatic carcinoma found in this skeleton is of unknown origin - it is impossible to say where it started			1
however , analysis proved it came from a malignant soft - tissue tumour and spread across large parts of the body , making it the oldest ‘ convincing ’ example of metastatic cancer ever found , the authors of the study said			1
although it is one of the leading causes of death today , it is extremely rare in archaeological finds compared to other detectable killers			0
' we have very few examples [ before ] the first millennium ad			0
‘ we need to understand the history of the disease to better understand how it evolved and for that it is important to find more examples			0
’ the @entity110 archaeologist added : ‘ our analysis showed that the shape of the small lesions on the bones can only have been caused by a soft tissue cancer even though the exact origin is impossible to determine through the bones alone			0
’ @entity50 found the bones at the once - populated @entity119 site , 750km ( 466 miles ) downstream from the modern capital of @entity121			2
co-author , dr @entity62 from the @entity123 and @entity13 at the @entity29 , said : ' from footprints left on wet mud floors , to the healed fractures of many ancient inhabitants , @entity66 offers a unique insight into what it was like to live there - and die - in @entity132 - ruled @entity131 3,200 years ago			2
' signs of the metastatic cancer , shown via pathalogical lesions , were also found in the right scapula , pictured left			0
tests using radiography and a scanning electron microscope provided clear imaging of these lesions , pictured right the remains of the wealthy man , believed to have been between 25 and 35 when he died , were found in a tomb in the north - eastern cemetery area at @entity66 in @entity13 , pictured tests using radiography and a scanning electron microscope provided clear imaging of the lesions on the bones , with cancer metastases on the collar bones , shoulder blades , upper arms , vertebrae , ribs , pelvis and thigh bones			1
the researchers could only speculate on the cause of the cancer , with theories being carcinogens such as smoke from wood fires , genetic factors or from an infectious disease caused by parasites			0
to this day , the parasitic infection known as schistosomiasis is a cause of bladder cancer and breast cancer in men in the area			0
the researchers could only speculate on the cause of the cancer , also found in the left clavicle , pictured , with theories being carcinogens such as smoke from wood fires , genetic factors or from an infectious disease caused by parasites			0

the remains of the man were found in a tomb near the @entity12 in @entity13
he is believed to have been wealthy and aged between 25 and 35
bones show evidence of a metastatic carcinoma - a cancer that has spread
it is the oldest ' convincing ' example of this type of cancer ever found
researchers plan to use the discovery to explore underlying causes of cancer in ancient times
