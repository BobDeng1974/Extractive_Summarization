astronomers have discovered an exoplanet with the longest known year - 704 days			2
the planet , @entity3 , takes almost two @entity4 years to circle its star			1
in comparison , @entity6 orbits our sun once every 780 days			0
most of the 1,800 - plus exoplanets discovered to date are much closer to their stars and have much shorter orbital periods , astronomers claim			2
it takes @entity16 - 421b ( illustration pictured ) circles almost two @entity4 years to circle its star - or 704 days			1
@entity18 orbits an orange type k star that is cooler and dimmer than our sun ' finding kepler - 421b was a stroke of luck , ' said lead author @entity24 of the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) in @entity26			1
' the farther a planet is from its star , the less likely it is to transit the star from @entity4 's point of view			2
it has to line up just right			0
' kepler - 421b orbits an orange , type k star that is cooler and dimmer than our sun. it circles the star at a distance of about 110 million miles			1
as a result , this @entity41 - sized planet is chilled to a temperature of -93 째 c ( -135 째 f )			0
as the name implies , kepler - 421b was discovered using data from @entity47 ( illustration pictured )			1
the spacecraft stared at the same patch of sky for four years , watching for stars that dim as planets cross in front of them as the name implies , kepler - 421b was discovered using data from the @entity16 spacecraft			1
the spacecraft stared at the same patch of sky for four years , watching for stars that dim as planets cross in front of them			0
it takes @entity16 - 421b circles almost two @entity4 years to circle its star - or 704 days			1
@entity18 orbits an orange type k star that is cooler and dimmer than our sun. it circles the star at a distance of about 110 million miles			0
the host star , @entity71 , is located about 1,000 light - years from @entity4 in the direction of the constellation @entity74			1
as a result , this @entity41 - sized planet is chilled to a temperature of -93 째 c ( -135 째 f )			0
it the first example of a potentially non-migrating gas giant in a transiting system that astronomers have found			1
despite its patience , @entity83 only detected two transits of kepler - 421b due to that world 's extremely long orbital period			2
the planet 's orbit places it beyond the ' snow line ' - the dividing line between rocky and gas planets			0
outside of the snow line , water condenses into ice grains that stick together to build gas giant planets			2
' the snow line is a crucial distance in planet formation theory			0
' we think all gas giants must have formed beyond this distance , ' explained professor @entity24			2
since gas giant planets can be found extremely close to their stars , in orbits lasting days or even hours , theorists believe that many exoplanets migrate inward early in their history			1
@entity3 shows that such migration is n't necessary			0
it could have formed right where it can now be seen			0
' this is the first example of a potentially non-migrating gas giant in a transiting system that we 've found , ' continued professor @entity24			1
the host star , @entity71 , is located about 1,000 light - years from @entity4 in the direction of the constellation @entity74			1
the @entity16 probe was launched in 2009			0
to find the latest planet , spacecraft stared at the same patch of sky for four years , watching for stars that dim as planets cross in front of them			0

kepler - 421b was discovered using data from the @entity16 spacecraft
it takes almost two @entity4 years to circle its star 1,000 light years away
this is the first example of a potentially ' non-migrating gas giant in a transiting system that we 've found , ' said lead author @entity24
*scientists* *initially* thought gas giants migrate inward in their early history
