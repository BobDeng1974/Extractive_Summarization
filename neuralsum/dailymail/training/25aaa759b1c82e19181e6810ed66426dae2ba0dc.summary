@entity1 , 35 , from @entity8 has been given the task of measuring just how fit all 126 @entity7 contestants really are			1
the father - of - two only landed his job as director of leisure at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity8 , eight months ago , but now his place of work is home to the entire @entity7 cortege ahead of the pageant on december 14			1
@entity1 is the envy of all his friends being put in charge of fitness for the @entity7 contest			1
he is pictured with ( from left to right ) miss @entity23 , 21 , a molecular biology student from @entity25 , @entity27 @entity26 , 19 , a media student from @entity28 , miss @entity30 @entity29 , 21 , a business student from @entity31 , miss @entity33 @entity32 , 20 , a film and media student from @entity36 , and miss @entity38 @entity37 , 24 , a senior student doctor from @entity39 @entity40 : @entity41 , formerly miss @entity42 , @entity44 , is representing the @entity45 at the @entity7 contest he said : ‘ i ’d love to use the line , it ’s a tough job , but somebody has to do it , but i ’d be lying as it probably is the best job in the world			1
‘ i ’ve been a fitness trainer since 1999 and never realised when i started out that my diploma in fitness training and sports therapy would lead to anything like this			2
‘ the contestants are all stunning and very glamorous , but they range in fitness from fairly unfit to spectacularly fit			1
‘ i had to supervise the tests and mark them and a few girls literally collapsed with exhaustion afterwards			0
@entity1 only landed his job as director of leisure at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity8 , eight months ago ‘ you could tell some of the girls have never exercised			1
some did n’t know how to use the rowing machine			2
‘ we were pushing it to the max with their fitness assessment and some were not really ready for that			0
' @entity1 continued : ‘ the fittest of them all was 22 - year - old miss @entity74 , who is called @entity77 – she got full marks in every discipline and scored 20			1
she was absolutely stunning with dark hair and trained very hard			0
‘ @entity81 scored 16 and the other home nations girls were all pretty fit as well			2
‘ they all had to do four different fitness tests in a period of 10 to 11 minutes			0
‘ we started with the 500 metre row in the quickest time , then full body weight squats and then as many press ups as they could manage in a minute			0
‘ we ended with full burpees that are a mix of press - up , squats and pulling yourself up and it was as many of those in a minute as possible			2
’ unsurprisingly , @entity1 's friends from five - a - side football and former workmates have all been asking if he needs any help with the job while the contestants are in town			1
he said : ‘ i was quite surprised at the level of interest it attracted with people contacting me out of the blue asking if i needed a hand – as well as my mates from five - a - side i ’ve had my uncles asking questions			0
‘ i was quite surprised by some of their performances and a few had booked personal trainers ahead of this , so were taking it very seriously			0
' @entity1 might be surrounded by beauty pageant contestants every day at work , but the trainer is adamant that he really only has eyes for his wife @entity125 , 28 , and their daughters – @entity127 , six , and @entity128 , three			1
he said : ' i know my wife understands it ’s all part of the job			0
’ he continued : ' others had no idea how to use a rowing machine , so had clearly never seen the inside of a gym			2
‘ all the guys will have their own view on who is the fittest – but my job is to assess who is truly fit and there was a stand out winner on that front			0
