elegant in a pistachio and nude dress , @entity0 of the @entity1 was every inch the royal style icon as she and husband @entity6 arrived in @entity7 this morning			1
the visit comes after the @entity10 , led by @entity8 , stepped up its sabre - rattling over the weekend following the launch of a refurbished @entity14 nuclear submarine capable of striking @entity15			1
despite the best efforts of dictator mr @entity8 , the royal couple appeared undaunted and were welcomed by huge crowds waving @entity1 and @entity7 flags as they stepped off the plane			1
formally welcomed by president @entity26 outside the striking @entity42 presidential palace , the royals were all smiles as they , along with the @entity7 president , met well - wishers lined up along the red carpet			2
afterwards , they were taken inside where @entity6 held bilateral talks with the @entity7 president ahead of a three - day tour of the country			2
@entity0 and @entity6 then travelled to the @entity51 in the capital , which was established by presidential decree in 1956 - three years after the @entity54 ended			0
the conflict , one of the first of the @entity58 , saw @entity60 and @entity61 troops line up alongside the @entity7 , while the @entity62 slugged it out alongside @entity65 rebels in the north			0
threats : @entity69 dictator @entity8 has ramped up the belligerent rhetoric over the weekend talks : after the formal welcome , the royals and president @entity26 decamped to the @entity42 for talks all smiles : the @entity1 royal couple looked thrilled to be in @entity7 for a three - day tour signature : @entity6 signs the @entity42 visitor 's book , watched by @entity0 allies : @entity6 shakes hands with president @entity26 , watched by dignitaries from both nations common cause : like the @entity36 tour , the @entity1 tour of @entity7 is aimed at boosting trade eventually , the war , which ended in 1953 , resulted in the partition of @entity7 with the @entity10 remaining communist while the @entity7 developed into a modern democracy			1
only @entity7 veterans of the @entity7 and @entity95 wars can be buried there , although the burial ground does have one foreign resident - @entity98 @entity97			0
during their visit to the cemetery , the couple met @entity54 veteran @entity102 , with several others lining up to tell the couple of their experiences			0
although a delegation from @entity69 has visited the cemetery , relations between @entity10 and @entity7 remain frosty with mr @entity8 ramping up the belligerent rhetoric over the weekend			0
news of @entity69 's latest attack submarine also came hot on the heels of photos released of unpredictable dictator @entity8 visiting an air base , where he checked out equipment on a fighter jet and apparently ‘ gave instructions ’ to pilots			1
tribute : following the meeting with president @entity26 , the couple visited the @entity51 remembrance : there , they paid tribute to the soldiers killed during the @entity54 of the 1950s split : the war saw the @entity60 and @entity61 line up with what is now @entity7 against the communists of the north respectful : during their visit to the cemetery , the couple met with some of @entity7 's war veterans honour : only they can be buried in the @entity51 , although there is one @entity98 buried there according to local news agencies , @entity8 then climbed into the cockpit of one of the pursuit aircraft and congratulated the pilots for their skills before promoting four squadron leaders on the spot			2
news of @entity8 ’s visit prompted a @entity7 source to remark that the @entity10 ’s pilots have little experience in air battles and are ‘ seized with fear ’ at the thought of taking on @entity15 ’s airmen who have access to far superior technology			0
whether @entity8 ’s visit - his ninth to air force units this year - and the launching of the nuclear - capable submarine was just ‘ sabre - rattling ’ or a severe warning of troubles ahead was not immediately apparent			1
but the work on the 1958 @entity14 vessel to bring it up to standards capable of putting to sea and possibly firing ballistic weapons is being watched carefully by @entity7 ’s military .			0
