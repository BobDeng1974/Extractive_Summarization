by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 14 october 2013 ' too many buttons ' : professor @entity2 lamented the change in museums these days museums are too full of computer screens and are ‘ patronising ’ towards children , @entity2 said yesterday			1
the classicist and tv presenter said she wanted to ‘ ban computers ’ from museums which had lost some of their ‘ mystique ’ and ‘ glamour ’			1
professor @entity2 , 58 , said museums had ‘ done a huge amount to get children in ’			1
but she added : ‘ a part of me thinks that some of it is a bit patronising			2
‘ some of that old mystique ... some of the glamour has gone a bit – too many bloody labels and buttons to push			1
i would ban any computers from any galleries			2
’ she said she had taken her children to the @entity29 , but all they wanted to do was ‘ push the buttons ’			1
and she bemoaned the replacement of traditional museum displays in glass cases with interactive exhibitions			1
she said : ‘ we found this beautiful gallery of stuffed birds , and there was a notice saying “ sorry , we realise this is totally unacceptable and the way the birds were killed would n’t have lived up to @entity41 ”			2
’ the note explained that the gallery was to be replaced ‘ with some great interactive display ’ , she added			2
the @entity46 professor has presented several @entity48 historical documentaries , mainly focusing on the @entity49			1
speaking at the @entity50 , she revealed that her love of @entity46 was inspired by a visit to the @entity53 when she was five			0
she could not see into the high glass cases , so a curator opened one and brought out a piece of carbonised @entity59 cake that was 2,500 years old			1
‘ i could n’t believe it was so old			0
i just knew that this was something that was kind of outside anything i had ever begun to think about before , ’ she said			0
she added that nowadays ‘ they would n’t get the carbonised cake out ’ , but that children could do things like ‘ have a sleepover among the mummies at the @entity53 ’			2
changed : places like the @entity29 used to be all about the artefacts , @entity2 claims now it is all about technology , @entity2 said			1
she reminisced about seeing @entity59 cake on her first trip professor @entity2 defended the teaching of @entity77 and @entity78 in schools , saying children should be allowed to study without having ‘ really specific employment objectives ’			1
she said : ‘ it is about getting exercise with the brain , the more you exercise it and expand it into different areas the better a citizen you will be			0
’ she also said being an academic would always come before her tv work			0
‘ you can go down a treacherous path , that all you need to do is do telly and that ’s enough – it ’s not , ’ she said			0
asked what her colleagues thought of her tv work and attempts to popularise classics , she joked that they ‘ were very polite ’			0
‘ it is quite a good idea to do [ this sort of thing ] when you are a bit older , ’ she added			0
‘ i have done my time , i do my teaching			0
‘ i ’m first a professional classicist			0
everything else i do , i do in my so - called spare time , and i think that is important			0
