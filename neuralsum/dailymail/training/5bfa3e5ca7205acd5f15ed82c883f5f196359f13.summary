by @entity0 last updated at 6:19 pm on 27th december 2011 astronomers all over the world were left awe - struck by @entity4 's incredible close shave with the @entity5 as it came within 87,000 miles of its fiery surface last week			1
and now , the comet 's trajectory across the @entity11 's skies have been captured in dazzling detail by an astronomy enthusiast			1
using only a simple digital camera with a long exposure to let more light in , these incredible images were taken by stargazer @entity18 as @entity4 blazed a trail through the night sky after appearing over the @entity11 's horizon			1
magical moment : stargazer @entity18 captured @entity4 streaking across the night sky at @entity25 , @entity26 , on the southern coast of @entity28 trailblazing : after its near - miss with the @entity5 , @entity4 continued its journey through the @entity31 over @entity32			1
@entity33 used a digital camera with a long exposure to capture the comet dazzling scene : mr @entity18 , a 36 - year - old it consultant , took advantage of the lack of light pollution from the remote peninsula experts expected the comet , which is 1,600ft in diameter , to have vapourised when it passed through the @entity5 's intensely hot corona			1
however , it survived the close encounter intact and continued on its path through space			0
the commander of the @entity52 took pictures of @entity4 last week from his vantage point 240 miles above the @entity11			1
but mr @entity18 managed to capture the comet with its long , streaky tail from the ground at @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity28			0
mr @entity18 , a 36 - year - old it consultant , took advantage of the lack of light pollution from the remote peninsula on the south coast of @entity28 to record the dazzling scene			0
global gazing : the comet 's journey was tracked all over the world			2
here , it is seen at dawn over @entity68 on december 22 up in the stars : @entity4 is seen over the @entity71 's base at @entity72 , in northern @entity74 's @entity73 mr @entity18 said : ' luckily @entity4 survived the near - miss with the @entity5 and it put on a magnificent display in the southern sky			1
' it passed about 87,000 miles from the @entity5 on december 16 when it was supposed to have been obliterated but re-emerged out the other side of the corona			1
it lost its tail during the close encounter but developed a new one as it streaked away			0
the comet has been tracked all over the world since passing over the @entity11 , spotted in @entity87			2
@entity88 , the commander of the @entity52 , saw the comet from a magnificent vantage point – 240 miles above the @entity11 ’s horizon			1
he described seeing the comet as ‘ the most amazing thing i have ever seen in space ’ in an interview with @entity96 in @entity97			0
@entity114 ’s @entity113 caught the great escape on camera			0
after the dramatic event it tweeted : ‘ @entity119 ! @entity4 lives ! @entity120 has survived its journey around the sun to reemerge on the other side			2
’ @entity4 was only discovered on november 27 this year and was named after the amateur @entity28 astronomer who spotted it , @entity123			2
@entity114 's @entity113 captured @entity4 diving past the sun just 87,000 miles from the surface - and surviving the ' graze ' @entity128 is on : @entity4 emerges from the clutches of the @entity5 and was spotted escaping last week by @entity114 's @entity113 it is classed as a ‘ @entity131 ’ , which is a class of comet whose orbit comes very close to the @entity5 they are named after the 19th - century @entity137 astronomer @entity136 , who figured out that they are actually the remains of one huge comet that broke apart			1
soon after @entity4 was found three separate space agencies excitedly began tracking its trajectory – @entity114 , the @entity143 and the @entity144			2
its fate was quickly marked as doomed because it would rush headlong into the @entity5 ’s hellish corona			2
writing on the @entity150 website , @entity148 scientist @entity147 said : ‘ we have here an exceptionally rare opportunity to observe the complete vaporization of a relatively large comet , and we have approximately 18 instruments on five different satellites that are trying to do just that			0
’ team effort : this map illustrates how countries from all over the world contribute to the running of the @entity52 however , @entity4 had other ideas and in a brief , but very clear , clip can be seen zooming away to safety from the @entity5 ’s fiery clutches			1
@entity168 , from the @entity169 , was stunned by @entity4 's close encounter			1
he told @entity171 : ‘ it was an extraordinary event			0
@entity4 was incredibly close to the @entity5 , closer to the @entity5 than the @entity11 is to the @entity173			1
‘ and it ’s certainly a pretty rare event			0
the @entity176 [ note : the video is from the @entity113 ] has seen many examples of comets being destroyed as they approached the @entity5 and there was a great deal of interest in this because there was an expectation of spectacular debris			0
‘ i suppose if something is big and tough enough it will survive			0
this event tells us that the comet was rather more robust than expected			0
doubtless it had a very rough ride though ! ’ mr @entity168 explained that comets have probably survived skirmishes with the @entity5 before , but we just have n’t been able to see them			0
‘ it just shows how good the technology is now , ’ he added .			0
