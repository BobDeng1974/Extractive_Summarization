by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is wary of the threat @entity4 pose to @entity6 's hopes of a constructors ' championship high this season			1
ninth place may not sound much in the grand scheme of things , but to a team like @entity6 such a position would effectively be as good as winning the title			1
the @entity17 - based marque are currently clinging on to ninth in this season 's title race courtesy of @entity22 ending the team 's 83 - race points drought in @entity25 in may			1
pushing on : @entity2 is hoping for a good end to the season with @entity6 on track : the @entity30 driver racing during qualifying ahead of last sunday 's @entity33 @entity32 in a chaotic race @entity22 captured ninth place to spark jubilant scenes within @entity6 , and set them up for another slice of history			1
after finishing in the top 10 for the first time in their four years in @entity40 last season , @entity6 could go one further this year			2
under @entity40 's complicated prize - money structure , the financial rewards would also be considerable if @entity6 could follow up with ninth on the back of their 10th spot in 2013			1
the team head into @entity40 's summer break knowing they have eight races to keep @entity51 at bay , and especially @entity4 , currently on their worst streak in the team 's history in 11 races without a point			1
' we 'd love to hold them off , ' said the 23 - year - old @entity60			2
' but to do that we need to be finishing in front of them , and at the moment we 're not doing that , so we 're hoping in a race when points do become available , they 're not in front of us			2
' we 're giving it our best shot , but without constant updates on the car it 's hard to keep knocking on their door			0
' some races we 're close , some we 're not as close			0
' thankfully for us they 're not closing the door on the teams in front of them			0
' it 's not like they 're looking at points every race and they 're just missing out			1
they 're not there at the moment			0
' because they 're not in a position where they can feel comfortable scoring points , it means we 're not right on the edge of our seats			0
' they need a bit of luck like we had			0
' competition : @entity100 's @entity4 team provide the biggest threat to @entity6 in the constructor 's championship jubilation : @entity22 of @entity105 got @entity6 's first two points of the season to put them ahead of @entity4 @entity100 did come close to breaking @entity4 's points duck in the @entity33 @entity32 on sunday , matching his best result of the year with 11th			1
@entity4 would certainly appear to be @entity6 's main threat with @entity51 struggling on and off the track			1
@entity2 feels a recent takeover of the team by a consortium of @entity116 and @entity117 businessmen will likely take time to bear fruit			2
' they 've gone through a lot of changes			0
i 've heard stuff about people going and different people changing roles , ' added @entity2			2
' like any sport , if you change people around it takes time for them to learn their new positions and communicate properly			0
' it takes a bit of time for a team to settle down , so for us that 's helping			0
' @entity2 , who remains hopeful of retaining his seat for next season , is still convinced he can score points of his own this year if given the right circumstances			1
' i know i can do it , i just need to have the right opportunity to get it done , ' said @entity2			2
' i believe in my ability to score points			0
there are people who have scored points , and i know i can do it as well			0

@entity2 wary of @entity4 threat to @entity6 's hopes in the standings
@entity6 currently ninth in the table after @entity22 's ninth - placed finish in @entity25 which ended an 83 - race points drought
