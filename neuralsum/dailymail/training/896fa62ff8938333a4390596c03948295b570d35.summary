but generous strangers restored local faith in the season of goodwill , by replacing the money within days			2
the savings club cash vanished along with @entity1 , 59 , who is thought to have fled the country and then jumped into the sea while on a ferry to @entity5			1
more than 60 families had spent all year paying money into the ' thrift ' fund at @entity1 's @entity25 pub in @entity26 , @entity27			1
they were horrified when it disappeared , with many relying on the annual pay - out to help with expenses in the run - up to @entity9			2
but the cash has now been replaced thanks to a rush of donations from kind - hearted members of the public - including one anonymous benefactor who gave £ 10,000			1
victims of the theft launched an online appeal at 4pm last thursday and by monday at 10.30pm , they had raised their target of £ 29,000			2
donations came in from all over the world , including @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			0
@entity47 , chairperson of @entity48 , said she was ' overwhelmed ' with the public 's generosity			0
she said : ' this has been truly humbling			0
the generosity of strangers at @entity9 has been remarkable			0
' people who do n't know us , people who have never been to our village , logged on and sent money			0
it brings a tear to my eye			0
' @entity26 is back on the map for the right reasons - this is a community looking after its own in the best possible way			2
@entity67 ' savings : more than 60 families had spent all year paying money into the ' thrift ' fund at @entity1 's @entity25 pub in @entity26 , @entity27 shocked : @entity72 , right , @entity27 councillor for @entity26 , was appalled when the fundraising scheme he helped set up was exploited by the pub landlord ' such a terrible event has brought people together - a real @entity9 spirit that is making millions of people smile			1
' @entity79 , the man behind the online campaign , added : ' it has been an astonishing team effort			0
this is far more than anyone expected			0
' it has touched people 's hearts in the week before @entity9			0
we can now give our neighbours the @entity9 they had saved all year to pay for			0
' @entity1 was last seen on december 9 and is believed to have boarded a ferry to @entity5 from @entity91			1
relief : incredibly , victims of the theft managed to raise their target within just four days - with one benefactor donating a huge £ 10,000 police say they are still hunting him in connection with the theft , but believe he may now be dead			1
officers are working on the theory that @entity1 did not disembark from the ferry in @entity105 , @entity5			1
det sgt @entity106 said : ' we continue to treat @entity1 's disappearance as a missing person inquiry but at this stage we do have to accept there is a possibility that he did not make it to @entity5 and may have taken his own life by jumping into the sea from the ferry			1
' i would like to appeal to anyone who has information to come and speak to us - his family are facing the terrible prospect that he may have committed suicide			2
' it is therefore imperative that we hear from anyone if they have heard from mr @entity1			1

one kind - hearted anonymous benefactor gave the villagers £ 10,000
landlord @entity1 is thought to have fled the country
police fear he may have jumped into the sea from a ferry bound for @entity5
