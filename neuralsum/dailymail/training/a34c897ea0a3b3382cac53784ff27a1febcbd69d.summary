intelligence gleaned by both the @entity163 and @entity144 indicated there is evidence that the increasingly beleaguered regime of @entity3 president @entity91 had used the weapons and in particular the devastating nerve agent sarin , officials said last month two @entity3 officials have denied the government has used chemical weapons against rebel forces , saying the regime had no need for them			1
warning : @entity144 president @entity143 has said that the use of chemical weapons in @entity3 would be a ' game changer ' while @entity3 president @entity91 said the @entity177 will pay a price ' in the heart ' of @entity180 and the @entity144 for their alleged backing @entity70 fundamentalist @entity3 official @entity182 called the @entity144 claims ' lies ' and likened them to false accusations that @entity186 possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the @entity144 invasion of that country			1

he told the @entity266 : from what we 've seen and the descriptions of the containers being dropped from the air , it certainly seems that the regime is using sarin in an unprepared state in these attacks			0
' but , as in the @entity279 subway bombings , sarin does not need to be weaponised and placed in missiles to kill			0

the government wants the team to inspect only @entity153 and not @entity82 , both sites of alleged chemical weapons attacks that the rebels and government accuse each other of perpetrating			1
the @entity3 conflict started with peaceful protests in march 2011 , but when these were suppressed it gradually turned into an increasingly sectarian civil war which , according to one opposition monitoring group , has cost more than 80,000 lives .			2
