one told the @entity52 : ‘ this certainly beats working			0
i ’ve sent pictures of the beach to my partner telling her i ’m working hard			2
’ during the day , attendees enjoyed long rosé - fuelled business lunches of huge plates of seafood			1
the cost of rooms in @entity5 last week was such that many private sector workers had to stay in cheaper destinations down the coast			1
by tuesday there was not a room to be had in any of the hotels in the entire city or a seat in any of its expensive restaurants			2
most councils sent only two or three representatives , but there were some notable exceptions			2
@entity78 and @entity79 sent 11 , the same number as the @entity81			0
the enterprise partnership for @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 sent 20 , and @entity87 and @entity88 sent ten			0

wish you were here ? officials would enjoy a day of eating , drinking , and closing deals at the marina ( pictured ) @entity143 , the delegation from @entity85 , took over as its headquarters the top floor of a bar overlooking the beach , paid for by private sector partners			1
@entity101 said the cost of its attendance to the taxpayer was £ 50,000 but claimed the return in private sector support would be five times higher			0
a council spokesman said : ‘ @entity91 , in common with all of @entity159 ’s major cities including @entity160 whose presence was led by the mayor of @entity160 , sent a private - public delegation with over 50 companies to @entity18 to attract investment and jobs			0
’ @entity169 of the @entity170 ’ @entity168 said : ‘ this conference is little more than a fancy taxpayer - funded get - together for council officers and companies in the @entity3			0
when councils are putting up taxes and failing to cut waste , many residents will wonder why on earth they are paying to send this many local politicians on a jolly to @entity5			1
