@entity0 ran in the only try as @entity2 crept back to the summit of the @entity4 after labouring to victory over @entity6 at the @entity7			1
just hours after @entity9 had underlined their title credentials with an empathic victory over @entity12 , @entity8 toiled to their fourth win of the season			0
@entity17 centre @entity0 's 36th - minute try was the solitary touch down of a drab spectacle short on highlights			2
@entity0 ran in the only try as @entity2 crept back to the summit of the @entity4 @entity0 showed strength to breach the whitewash , but it was an otherwise disappointing afternoon notable for some poor handling that will not have strengthened his claims to selection in this autumn 's @entity27			1
fly - half @entity29 finished with a 14 - point haul made up of four penalties and a conversion			0
@entity2 led 10 - 0 at half - time but resurgent @entity6 hit back through the kicking of @entity36 , who finished with four penalties , to secure a deserved losing bonus point			1
@entity39 showed his power with a muscular early run through the heart of the @entity44 ' defence , but when @entity8 sought to exploit an overlap @entity0 flung out a poor pass			2
@entity2 , who were missing injured @entity17 forwards @entity49 and @entity50 to injury , turned the screw at the scrum before @entity29 landed his first penalty			0
@entity36 finished the game with four penalties to secure a deserved losing point for @entity6 a scruffy quarter continued with @entity58 missing a simple three points and the former @entity17 fly - half was flattened by @entity61 shortly after			1
@entity63 's thunderous midfield hit enabled the champions to turn defence into attack , but the @entity44 recovered quickly and the deadlock continued			0
once again @entity2 began pounding at the @entity6 22 and once again they were let down by their handling with @entity0 culpable			1
but the @entity17 centre then made amends , showing his strength to slide over and touch down after the speed of a @entity8 counter-attack that began with a loose kick outwitted the @entity44			0
@entity2 's @entity76 beats his @entity6 rival to take a catch at the lineout @entity29 , @entity63 and @entity80 were involved before @entity0 chose to go it alone with @entity61 outside him and he had the tenacity to stampede over @entity58 and ride a despairing tackle from @entity84			1
the third quarter was dominated by a kicking duel from the tee between @entity58 and @entity29 as a poor match continued to disappoint			0
@entity89 and @entity90 collided , but the @entity6 full - back came up with the ball after plucking a superb catch from the air			2
the third quarter was dominated by a kicking duel from the tee between @entity58 and @entity29 there appeared to be little chance of a second try being added to @entity0 's touch down with a fourth @entity58 penalty keeping the scoreboard ticking over			0
@entity6 continued to snap at the heals of @entity2 , although their cause was not helped when @entity58 failed with a simple drop - goal and long - range penalty			1
at last the game opened up with @entity0 almost forcing his way over for a second time before his poor pass butchered a chance for @entity113			2
fittingly , the final act of the afternoon was a penalty from @entity29 .			0

@entity2 beat @entity6 *19* - 12
*saints* go to the top of the @entity4 table
