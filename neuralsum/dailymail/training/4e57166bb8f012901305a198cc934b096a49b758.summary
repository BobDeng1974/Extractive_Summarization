' for better or worse international law and @entity10 law does n't give us a right to be a parent , we need to start looking at the other parties involved in this , the child and look at the best interests of the child and the surrogate and perhaps we should be asking questions about justice and ethics and morality , ' she said			0

after the story broke of ' @entity114 ' it shed a light on the @entity5 surrogate industry and left a number of @entity10 couples , desperate for a baby , in limbo @entity94 and @entity34 ( pictured with babies @entity37 and @entity38 )			1
the couple had a long wait to get the babies back to @entity107 due to a crackdown on @entity5 surrogacy			1

' i think we both cried i do n't think we were allowed to hold them for 24 hours and when we went back to the nursery the next day we were actually allowed to hold them and feed them , ' @entity172 told @entity68			0
' there were people from @entity189 , @entity190 , people from @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and it was quite amazing , we 're talking eight or nine @entity10 surrogate children a day going through the embassy			0

in @entity10 commercial surrogacy is banned and unregulated in the @entity245			1
but chief judge @entity246 believes commercial surrogacy should be allowed in the country , regulated in @entity10 and banned in other overseas countries			1

@entity34 also believes @entity10 needs a proper national enquiry , that looks at all aspects of surrogacy			2
