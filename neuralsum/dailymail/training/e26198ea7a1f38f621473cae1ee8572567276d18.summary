a mother - of - four has written an hilarious open letter to her son 's female @entity3 friends , warning them they will be blocked if they post sexual ' selfies '			1
@entity7 , who lives in @entity8 , @entity9 with her husband , their three sons and a daughter , wrote the post entitled ' fyi ( if you 're a @entity16 ) ' on her blog on tuesday			1
it has since been viewed more than five million times and has received support from thousands of moms from across the country - although others slammed it for being ' self - righteous '			1
' dear ladies , ' the post on given breath begins , before slating the girls for uploading images of sexual poses in their bedrooms to @entity3 and urging them to have more self respect			1
warning : @entity7 , pictured with one of her sons , wrote a terse letter to her sons ' girl friends on her blog , warning them that if they continued to post sexual photographs of themselves , she would block them on their facebooks ' we have teenage sons , and so naturally there are quite a few pictures of you lovely ladies to wade through , ' she wrote			1
' wow – you sure took a bunch of selfies in your pajamas this summer ! ' your bedrooms are so cute ! our eight - year - old daughter brought this to our attention , because with three older brothers who have rooms that smell like stinky cheese , she notices girly details like that			2
' but @entity7 , who is the director of women 's ministry at @entity61 in @entity8 , said that teen boys will notice other things : ' for one , it appears that you are not wearing a bra , ' she wrote			1
she also quizzed the girls about why they are striking ' red - carpet poses ' before going to bed			1
' what 's up ? , ' she asked			0
' none of these positions is one i naturally assume before sleep , this i know			0
' she said that , while it appeared as if she was giving the girls a hard time for their choices of pictures , she was in fact encouraging them to celebrate the best parts of themselves			2
tickled : mrs @entity7 , pictured with her family , poked fun at the girls for their pouts and sultry bedroom poses having a laugh : she urged girls to take down their selfies which she said were not natural sleeping poses ' those posts do n’t reflect who you are ! ' she wrote			1
' we think you are lovely and interesting , and usually very smart			0
but ... what are you trying to say ? ' she said that she regularly checks her sons ' social media pages with them and , if they discover images such as the sultry poses , friends will be blocked because she cares about what the boys see			1
@entity7 added that there are no second chances and that those who wish to stay friendly with the family must keep their ' clothes on '			1
' if you try to post a sexy selfie , or an inappropriate @entity112 video – even once – you 'll be booted off our on - line island , ' she wrote			1
she acknowledged that some people may think her actions are ' old - school ' but that she simply wanted to raise boys with ' a strong moral compass '			2
close : she said she was being ' old school ' as she wants her boys to grow up with a strong moral compass encouragement : mrs @entity7 , who has one daughter ( pictured ) , told the girls they were beautiful on the inside and out and did n't need to post the pictures on @entity3 to prove anything ' every day i pray for the women my boys will love , ' she wrote			1
' i hope they will be drawn to real beauties , the kind of women who will leave them better people in the end			0
' i also pray that my sons will be worthy of this kind of woman , that they will be patient – and act honorably – while they wait for her			2
' she urged girls to take down their previously posted inappropriate selfies			2
' you are growing into a real beauty , inside and out , ' she said to the girls			2
' act like her , speak like her , post like her			2
' the blog post received mixed responses from readers - mostly because mrs @entity7 had included photos of her sons in bathing suits to accompany the words			1
after some readers said this gave a confusing message , she re-posted the blog with images of the boys with their clothes on			2
mixed responses : the original post sparked confusion as it included shirtless pictures of her sons critical : she slammed teenage girls for taking inappropriate ' selfies ' - pictures they take of themselves ( file picture ) but some readers still took issue with her opinions and delivery			1
' i understand the point your article was trying to make , ' one wrote , ' but you came across as holier than thou rather than a humble servant of @entity181			0
i would rather have seen you rewrite the article with a less judgmental tone than just repost it with new pictures and a snarky new title			0
' yet others thanked the mother for the letter , with one writing : ' way to go , @entity7 ! as a mom of two boys and two girls , i agree with you 100 % ! ' the blog post has been read more than five million times , she wrote on @entity3 on wednesday			1
mrs @entity7 lives with her husband @entity195 in @entity8 , @entity9 , where she serves as the director of women 's ministry at @entity61 @entity61 and owns a team fitness and coaching company			1
excerpts from @entity7 's open letter , which can be found in full on her blog : dear girls , we have teenage sons , and so naturally there are quite a few pictures of you lovely ladies to wade through [ on social media ]			1
wow – you sure took a bunch of selfies in your pajamas this summer ! your bedrooms are so cute ! our eight - year - old daughter brought this to our attention , because with three older brothers who have rooms that smell like stinky cheese , she notices girly details like that			2
i think the boys notice other things			0
for one , it appears that you are not wearing a bra			0
i get it – you ’re in your room , so you ’re heading to bed , right ? but then i ca n’t help but notice the red carpet pose , the extra-arched back , and the sultry pout			0
what ’s up ? none of these positions is one i naturally assume before sleep , this i know ... those posts do n’t reflect who you are ! we think you are lovely and interesting , and usually very smart			0
but what are you trying to say ? and now – big bummer – we have to block your posts			0
because , the reason we have these ( sometimes awkward ) family conversations around the table is that we care about our sons , just as we know your parents care about you ... in our house , there are no second chances , ladies			0
if you want to stay friendly with the @entity255 men , you ’ll have to keep your clothes on , and your posts decent ... i know that sounds harsh and old - school , but that ’s just the way it is under this roof for a while			0
we hope to raise men with a strong moral compass ... every day i pray for the women my boys will love			0
i hope they will be drawn to real beauties , the kind of women who will leave them better people in the end			0
i also pray that my sons will be worthy of this kind of woman , that they will be patient – and act honorably – while they wait for her ... you are growing into a real beauty , inside and out			0
act like her , speak like her , post like her			0
i 'm glad we 're friends			0
