the next time someone offers you a glass of wine , be grateful – it could save you from the agony of arthritis			2
women who indulge in moderate drinking halve the risk of certain forms of the illness , researchers have found			2
@entity14 academics found that women who drank at least three medium - sized glasses of wine a week - or the equivalent in beer or spirits - were up to 52 per cent less likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis			1
drink up : women who drink three glasses of wine a week could be halving their risk of arthritis around 400,000 @entity25 are affected by this type of arthritis and the majority are women , aged 40 to 70			1
it causes pain and swelling in the hands , wrists and feet and can make everyday tasks almost impossible			2
currently doctors are unable to prevent or cure the illness and they can only offer treatment to alleviate pain			2
the illness is caused by the body ’s own immune system - which normally fights infection - attacking the cells lining the joints			0
scientists believe that alcohol can counter this process because it lowers the body ’s immune response			0
but they have not been able to establish whether drinking more alcohol reduces the risk even further			0
the illness is caused by the body 's own immune system - which normally fights infection - attacking the cells lining the joints in this latest study , scientist from the @entity59 in @entity60 studied 34,100 women aged 39 to 84			1
they had all filled in surveys on how often they had drunk wine , spirits or beer over the course of a year those who drank at least three 150 ml glasses of wine , one pint of beer or two measures of spirits over a week were 52 per cent less at risk from rheumatoid arthritis			1
@entity75 , a phd student who contributed to the research said : ‘ the results of this study indicate that moderate consumption of alcohol may reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis among women			1
’ ‘ these results are in accordance with the inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease and add to the evidence that moderate alcohol consumption is not harmful and can be protective against such a chronic disease as rheumatoid arthritis			1
‘ however , the effect of higher doses of alcohol on the risk of rheumatoid arthritis remains unknown			1
’ professor @entity96 , medical research director of @entity97 said : ‘ small amounts of alcohol are also known to be beneficial in reducing the risk of other conditions such as heart disease , also an inflammatory disease , so the study is also telling us something about the mechanism of inflammation			0
‘ however , it ’s important to stress that the paper is n’t saying that excessive amounts of alcohol are good for you			0
‘ and it must be remembered that drinking alcohol in excess can be especially dangerous in rheumatoid arthritis patients who are taking some anti-rheumatoid drugs that may cause liver damage , and anti-inflammatory painkillers which can lead to gastro - intestinal problems , which can be exacerbated by alcohol			1
’ this latest study will add to the debate over whether alcohol is healthy - and if so , how much we should drink			0
for years scientists have claimed that drinking small amounts every day may help prevent heart attacks and strokes			0
but recently @entity128 academics cast doubt on this evidence by urging the public not to drink any more than three glasses of wine a week .			0
