bread has almost become synonymous with the word bloating and 20 per cent of @entity2 think they 'd be better off without it			1
but they may nearly all be wrong - and staying away from bread could do more harm than good , a panel of experts has warned			0
they argue that research has shown bread produces less bloating than pasta , and what makes us fat is not the sandwich , but the filling			2
unfairly maligned : experts say bread does n't cause bloating - but the fatty fillings many of us adore may cause weight gain moreover , while bread is often singled out as a bloating culprit , the evidence continues to show that this is more perception than reality			1
the list of celebrities who refuse to touch gluten is long			0
@entity27 wo n't let it pass her lips and @entity30 swears avoiding gluten is what keeps her young			2
although 98 per cent of @entity2 say they eat bread , many blame it for bloating and weight gain , and think they would be better off going gluten - free			1
and while 20 per cent think it ’s important to eat gluten and wheat - free , just 0.5 per cent of the population has gluten intolerance			2
this means many could be losing out on vital nutrition such as fibre , iron and calcium by avoiding bread			1
banned by the a-list : many celebrities , such as @entity30 and @entity50 , claim they maintain their trim figures by avoiding gluten - containing products , such as bread in fact , gluten free products can actually be higher in additives , saturated fat and sugar , @entity58 from the @entity59 , told a @entity61 conference of dieticians and nutritionists discussing bloating this month at @entity64			1
she also cited a new ( as yet unpublished ) study from the @entity67 , which showed bread produced less physically measurable abdominal bloating than a pasta meal , despite diners saying they expected the bread would bloat them more			0
@entity71 , of the @entity72 , added it is a common misconception that bread is fattening - ' it 's what goes on the bread that is most harmful to our waistlines , ' she argued			0
hidden enemy : fatty sandwich fillings such as egg mayo are more likely to cause weight gain than the bread that surrounds them , experts say two average slices of bread provide around 190 calories and 2g of fat , but spreading margarine or butter on them almost doubles the calories ( 334 calories ) and adds 16g fat			1
furthermore , the nation ’s favourite sandwich filling – egg mayonnaise – provides just under 600 calories and a huge 34g of fat , which is almost half the recommended daily intake for a woman			1
ms @entity71 added that many people assume white bread is bad for us , but this is not the case , saying : ' the half and half types such as @entity107 , that look and taste like white but combine white and wholemeal flours can contain 75 per cent of the fibre content of wholemeal			0
' ' as well as being a good source of calcium , iron and fibre , two slices of bread contain 20 - 30 per cent of our recommended nutrient intake of vitamin @entity120 [ and other vital nutrients ]			1
' at just 5 - 10p per two slice serving it ’s a very inexpensive way to get some good nutrition in your diet			0
' @entity129 thief : bread was found to be less bloating than a bowl of pasta so if it ’s not bread that causes bloating , what does ? gastroenterologist , psychotherapist and medical adviser to the @entity141 , dr @entity142 said that ' bloaters ' may just be more sensitive to the feeling of abdominal gas , but not actually produce more of it			2
' possible risk factors for bloating include obesity , anxiety or depression , being inactive , constipated or premenstrual , and , in those with irritable bowel syndrome , eating too many fermentable carbohydrate sources in general , not just wheat , ' he added			0
for example , some people with @entity141 may react with bloating on consumption of wheat but this is possibly more likely due to the presence of fructans found in many foods including onions , artichokes , asparagus and leeks rather than gluten , the panel concluded .			0

@entity2 *falsely* blame bread for bloating and weight gain
one fifth of @entity2 believe they would benefit from avoiding bread
while 5 ****%**** claim to be gluten intolerant , true number is 0.5 ****%****
bread contributes almost a fifth of the nation ’s intake of calcium and *magnesium* , *15* ****%**** of our daily iron intake and 20 ****%**** of our fibre
