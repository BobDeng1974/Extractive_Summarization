an auction house has provoked fury in the @entity3 community after it sold @entity5 memorabilia on the holiest day in the @entity3 calendar			1
@entity7 sold flags emblazoned with swastikas and @entity11 armbands on september 25 , as @entity3 observed @entity12			1
the @entity14 auction house has since admitted the timing of the sale was ' unfortunate ' and tried to donate an undisclosed amount to a @entity19 charity , which refused the offer			1
@entity22 @entity21 ( seen right ) , admitted the timing of the sale had been ' unfortunate ' the @entity24 refused the donation on the grounds they do n’t take money from the sale of items associated with the @entity5 regime			1
a spokesperson for the charity said : ' the @entity24 will not accept any donations from organisations which profit from the sale of items associated with the @entity5 regime			2
' it is our view that these items are best placed in archives , museums or in an educational context			0
' mr @entity21 defended the auction house , based in @entity44 , @entity14 , and said yesterday : ' not being @entity3 , how am i expected to know the dates of @entity3 festivals ? ' the sum we offered was not the proceeds of any specific sale , it would have been a bona fide ex-gratia donation			1
' they refused it because it was against their policy			0
' ' it 's not my place to make moral judgements ' : items going under the hammer included @entity11 armbands and an @entity65 bayonet the sale included a wide range of @entity5 memorabilia , including an @entity65 bayonet , @entity11 armbands , a range of swastika flags and @entity65 crockery			1
recent collections of @entity5 photos , cutlery from the @entity77 and cuffs belonging to the @entity79 , an ss division originally formed from concentration camp guards , were also included in the sale			2
although against the law in some @entity84 countries , including @entity85 and @entity86 , the sale of @entity5 memorabilia is legal in the @entity88			0
mr @entity21 added : ' if the law changes we will abide by it to the letter			0
but we do not actively court @entity5 items and it is not for me to make a moral judgement			2
@entity21 defended the auction house in @entity44 , @entity14 , which he said handles items ' sensitively and sensibly ' ' we ’ve sold a sofa and other things associated with @entity100 and he ordered the bombing of @entity102 where tens of thousands of people died , yet we did n’t have people saying those sales were disgusting			2
' we do handle items sensitively and sensibly , and in no way do we wish to glorify the @entity5 regime			0
' this time , i have turned away items that i do not wish to be associated with : namely a cosh used at @entity111 and a book entitled ‘ covenant with @entity115 ’ with horrific photos			0
' as an auctioneer , it is not my place to make moral judgements , but part of what we do is to keep alive the worst element in human nature			1
' if you keep these things alive in people ’s consciousness - and do n’t bury them - we can hope the terrible things will never happen again			0
' no one is glorifying the @entity65 or the @entity19 - far from it			0
' @entity12 , also known as the @entity12 , is the holiest day of the year for @entity3 people , and is traditionally marked with fasting and prayer .			1
