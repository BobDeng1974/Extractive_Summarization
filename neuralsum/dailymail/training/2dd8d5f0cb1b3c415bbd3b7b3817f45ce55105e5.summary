a @entity1 tv reporter covering this week 's blizzard was very nearly injured on the job , but it was n't the dangerous elements that could have done her in			2
it was a car skidding out of control			0
what 's more , the driver who came so close to smashing into @entity9 did so in a live @entity12 @entity1 shot			1
watch the car behind her : @entity14 4 @entity1 reporter was nearly hit by a car during a live shot monday near a snowy @entity1 street the perilously close call came just as @entity9 was ending her segment			1
she was reporting from a nearly deserted , snow - covered @entity1 street when three cars came to a stop at a red light			2
as the cars prepared to make a turn in @entity9 's direction , one of them revs the engine			1
@entity9 carries on calmly , without evening looking behind her			0
shocking : as @entity9 spoke into the camera , a car behind her revved its engine then spun wildly around a corner unfazed : the car came dangerously close to @entity9 , who never looked in the direction of the noise vehicle meanwhile , over her shoulder , the revved up driver 's turn went so wide that his car came shockingly close to taking out @entity9			1
the car than drives away and out of the shot			0
the super professional @entity9 did n't even flinch , though she must have known something was up by the noise coming from the car , but the in - studio anchors did			2
' not sure if that was a little sliding or spinning or intentional , ' said one of the shocked anchors			0
suspicious : while she could n't see it , the in - studio anchors commented that the car 's spinout looked suspiciously purposeful			0

*viewers* and even her anchors in the studio *wondered* if the driver in @entity12 @entity1 reporter @entity9 's shot skidded on purpose
*footage* from monday night shows the driver revving his engine at a stop light before *drifting* wildly around a turn and nearly hitting @entity9
