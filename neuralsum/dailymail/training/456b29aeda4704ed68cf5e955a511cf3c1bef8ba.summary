by @entity0 a judge has slammed a council for removing an elderly woman from her home while the son who cared for her was out			1
it took the son 19 days to get the council to tell him where they had taken his mother , and only after he resorted to legal threats			1
district judge @entity9 described @entity11 ’s treatment of the 81 - year - old woman , a former magistrate with severe dementia , as ‘ woefully inadequate ’			1
district judge @entity9 described @entity11 's treatment of the 81 - year - old woman , a former magistrate with severe dementia , as ' woefully inadequate ' the council ’s social services staff removed the woman and put her in a care home as they thought she may have been abused by her son , who lived with her			1
but their own inquiries and a subsequent police investigation found no evidence			0
judge @entity9 said the manner in which the social services removed the woman without getting the correct court orders violated her human rights , and described it as ‘ unlawful detainment ’			1
he also said she now has little prospect of being able to return to her home			0
the council has since agreed to apologise to the woman and her son for its ‘ failings ’			2
the details emerged in a ruling made by the judge at the @entity43 , which deals with cases involving sick and vulnerable people			1
he ordered that the woman and her son could not be identified			2
the woman , a magistrate for 20 years , was described as ‘ very independent ’			2
she went to church every sunday as well as to @entity51 classes			0
the judge said the woman had lived at her house for 32 years and was rooted in her local community			0
her son sold his business abroad so he and his partner , along with a care worker he employed , could look after her			0
the judge said that in september 2012 the manager of a care centre the woman attended had raised concerns about bruises and scratches on her face and legs			2
a month later , a visiting student social worker saw more injuries and alerted her bosses			0
the details emerged in a ruling made by the judge at the @entity43 , based at the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 , which deals with cases involving sick and vulnerable people the same day , the social worker and a colleague visited again while only the care worker was there and removed the woman			1
the son found out where his mother was after his solicitor wrote to @entity85 threatening legal action			1
the son described to @entity87 yesterday how he returned home to find his mother gone			2
he said : ‘ the care worker said to me , “ the council have taken her to a place of safety			0
” ‘ i thought you need a warrant to enter someone ’s house , but they just came and took her away			0
’ he said it was possible that because the care worker was foreign , she did not understand the sort of rights @entity105 might expect			0
he also said he was eventually given access to his mother at the care home , but under severe restrictions			1
‘ i was only allowed to visit her in the afternoons , and a staff member sat with us , ’ he said			0
judge @entity9 lifted council restrictions that prevented the son from seeing his mother without being monitored by social workers			1
