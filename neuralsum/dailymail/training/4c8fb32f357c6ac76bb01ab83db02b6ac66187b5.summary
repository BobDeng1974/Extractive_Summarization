author @entity0 was given total access to @entity2 during the 2013 - 14 season , @entity4 's first in charge of the @entity7 giants			1
in his new book @entity9 , @entity0 uses his behind - the - scenes pass to give readers a unique insight into @entity4 's debut campaign in @entity14			1
in this extract he covers @entity2 's memorable performance against @entity17 in the @entity18 , a night where @entity4 's men played like @entity20 to leave the @entity21 with a 3 - 1 victory			1
@entity2 boss @entity4 ( centre ) watches his side take apart @entity17 in october 2013 how @entity4 told his @entity2 players a story about water polo to inspire them to @entity29 victory against @entity30 @entity4 admits @entity18 semi-final defeat by @entity33 was the ' biggest f * * * - up ' of his life as a coach @entity4 admits that he could see himself managing @entity37 one day ( and he turned down @entity17 and @entity30 for the @entity2 job ! ) a grand total of 94 consecutive passes across three minutes and 27 seconds was emblematic of the ' taking of @entity41 ' – a night when @entity2 conquered the @entity21 and @entity4 was finally able to smile in satisfaction			1
inevitably , @entity2 's play in this 3 - 1 win at the home of @entity17 drew to mind that of @entity20 on that remarkable night in 2010 when they hammered @entity47 's @entity33 5 - 0 at the @entity48			1
those 94 passes marked a special moment in @entity52 football			2
the reigning champions were in an intimidating and formidable football stadium , @entity17 had bought notable reinforcements during the close season and their coach was the excellent @entity58 – unbeaten at home until that point			2
everything went right for @entity2 for 80 sweet minutes			2
they were almost perfect – it was the game in which @entity4 proved to himself that he could get a team to play with the agility and quality of @entity20 without actually having those ' @entity20 ' players			1
all along , everyone , including @entity4 , had strenuously attempted to be clear that this was n't supposed to be @entity20 2.0			1
@entity69 ( right ) shouts with delight after scoring after just seven minutes to give @entity2 the lead @entity72 puts @entity2 2 - 0 ahead after rounding goalkeeper @entity73 ( left ) at the @entity21 @entity72 celebrates his goal against @entity58 's side during the group stage of the @entity18 the front cover of new book @entity9 @entity79 summed up the feelings of the dressing room : ' we have produced 80 fantastic minutes but we are n't @entity83			1
i understand the comparisons but we do n't have players like @entity87 or @entity88 and we are , basically , different			0
we just want to dominate games by dominating possession			0
' before speaking to the media , @entity4 is in the dressing room and takes time to phone a friend : ' calm , and feet on the ground kiddo , but ... what an exhibition ! what an exhibition ! ' the @entity2 goals come from their three forward players			1
( @entity69 ) @entity69 repeats his jink into space and fierce shot which squared the score against @entity30 in the @entity29			0
( @entity72 ) @entity104 is terrific in losing @entity105 , who is over-run , in order to hit the second , after which @entity2 string together a succession of passes over 40 seconds which leaves their rival in tatters			2
after ( @entity115 ) @entity114 robs the ball back in the centre circle , @entity79 zig - zags around so much that he leaves @entity118 sea - sick and scores with a right - foot shot			2
@entity58 's side has just whipped @entity37 4 - 1 , but for a while it 's like @entity2 are making them dance			1
the shielding players , the formidable @entity125 and @entity126 , are tied up by @entity69 , @entity72 , @entity79 and ( @entity128 ) @entity127 over and over again			0
along with @entity114 , they give a recital in how to control possession , so disorientating the home players that the @entity133 tv commentator , @entity132 , a specialist in @entity14 football , says : ' for the @entity17 players , what we are seeing is a little embarrassing			2
in fact , @entity17 are hauling up the white flag of surrender			2
' nationality : @entity142 : 43 clubs played for : @entity20 ( 1990 - 2001 ) , @entity144 ( 2001 - 2002 ) , @entity145 ( 2002 - 2003 ) , @entity144 ( 2003 ) , @entity146 ( 2003 - 2005 ) , @entity147 ( 2005 - 06 ) major honours : 6 @entity150 titles , 2 @entity151 , 1 @entity18 , 1 @entity152 , 2 @entity153 , 1 @entity154 teams managed : @entity156 ( 2007 - 2008 ) , @entity20 ( 2008 - 2012 ) , @entity2 ( 2013 - present ) major honours : 3 @entity150 titles , 2 @entity151 , 2 @entity158 , 3 @entity153 , 3 @entity159 , 1 @entity7 title , 1 @entity161 then , in the 65th minute , @entity2 lay on a gigantic rondo – a succession of passes which astonishes the world of football for its precision , speed and duration			1
during nearly three - and - a - half minutes , @entity2 put together 94 passes involving all 10 outfield players			1
the team pass the ball for more than 200 seconds during which time the @entity21 goes silent and the @entity17 players pretty much surrender			1
during this succession of passes the ball bounces off the @entity179 defenders twice , it is deflected by @entity105 once and @entity180 wins it back once , but manages to keep it in @entity17 's possession for only seven seconds before ( @entity184 ) @entity183 robs it back with a brilliant tackle			1
all in all it 's so spectacular that that very night various @entity189 users put all three minutes 27 seconds up on the internet – sometimes with accelerated motion and accompanied by the theme tune from the @entity193			2
the giant rondo sums up what @entity4 has been asking his players to learn			2
the stats tell the story : @entity114 passes the ball 18 times in this one action , then @entity79 ( 14 ) , @entity127 ( 13 ) , @entity69 ( 12 ) , @entity202 ( 11 ) and @entity183 ( 10 )			0
the defenders and centre forward have been involved slightly less – ( @entity206 ) @entity205 ( 7 passes ) , ( @entity208 ) @entity209 ( 6 ) , @entity72 ( 2 ) , @entity210 ( 1 )			0
@entity211 @entity79 ( left ) puts the result beyond doubt with @entity2 's third and final goal @entity2 defender @entity205 ( sat down ) is shown a red card after a professional foul on @entity125 if the performances of the midfielders have been memorable ( @entity114 and @entity127 both boast 95 per cent pass accuracy ) , the exhibition laid on by @entity72 leaves @entity222 speechless			1
even more than fulfilling the essence of the false nine , he has given a fluid forward display , flitting in and out of all the attacking positions and popping up where he is least expected			0
@entity2 's display unleashes a stream of praise			1
@entity230 talks about his amazement at ' this great exhibition '			0
@entity234 , the former @entity235 and @entity236 captain , talks about ' a great level of super-positive football with everyone participating , and which is great fun to watch '			0
@entity241 says : ' it was hard to imagine the @entity2 which won the treble improving but @entity4 is achieving just that			2
' the then @entity2 president , @entity245 , glows : ' for 80 minutes we played perfect football – the best football i 've seen in my life			0
' during the post-match dinner which @entity2 always lays on for players , coaches , sponsors and media , whether they win or lose , @entity250 sums it all up in just a few words : ' a fiesta for the eyes			0
' @entity4 gives instructions to his players during @entity2 's convincing win in @entity41 @entity17 striker @entity263 ( second from right ) scores a consolation goal for the hosts from this point , @entity2 begin to play the football their new coach wants			1
' for everything to come off for us , the players need to run their legs off but to use the ball like they did when they were kids , ' @entity4 explains			0
his players are bubbling with excitement			0
@entity69 : ' they are little details but really important			0
@entity222 has boosted my confidence			0
' @entity127 : ' he 's got incredible ideas			0
' @entity79 : ' his arrival has been refreshing , a great stimulus			0
i 'm 29 but under @entity222 i 'm learning tactical concepts i 'd never heard of before			0
' right now we ca n't be absolutely certain if the @entity21 is the turning point of @entity2 's entire season , but it is unquestionable that october 2 , 2013 will forever be a red letter day for @entity4			1
when they land back in @entity291 the coach reads a quote from @entity293 in a newspaper : ' @entity295 has reached @entity296			0
' @entity4 throws it in the bin			0
@entity9 : the @entity299 of @entity4 's first season at @entity2 ' is out now in paperback and ebook , published by @entity304 / @entity303			1
