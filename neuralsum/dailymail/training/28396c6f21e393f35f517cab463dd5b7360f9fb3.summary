by @entity0 @entity1 will discover on tuesday if @entity2 can play any part in their bid to qualify for the @entity5			1
the @entity7 skipper has remained at the club ’s @entity9 training camp after being stretchered off with a hamstring injury during sunday ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity13			1

major doubt : @entity2 could miss all of @entity1 's @entity5 qualifiers after injuring his hamstring setback : the @entity1 skipper looks irritated by the injury that could rule him out for months bad news : @entity1 captain @entity2 suffered a hamstring injury against @entity13 the worst - case scenario is a tear that could see the 29 - year - old sidelined for up to eight weeks			1
that would rule him out of all three rounds of games the @entity37 champions must negotiate if they are to earn a £ 15million group stage jackpot from the continent ’s elite competition			0
it could also potentially make the national skipper a doubt for @entity46 ’s @entity45 opener against @entity47 on september 7			0
@entity2 and manager @entity48 are still hoping the scan reveals only some form of strain			1
even then , there is no realistic chance of the midfielder featuring in the opening @entity5 tie against @entity57			1
@entity1 travel to the @entity60 capital in seven days ’ time , with the return at @entity62 a week later			1
ice cool : @entity64 striker @entity63 celebrates his goal for @entity1 against @entity13 on sunday @entity64 striker @entity63 , on target against @entity13 , admitted @entity2 ’s absence in the qualifiers would be a significant blow			1
but @entity63 remains convinced the club would still have enough quality to reach the group stage – with @entity73 the leading contender to step in			2
‘ @entity2 is a big character in the dressing room , ’ said @entity63			0
‘ he is our captain and a great player so obviously we are concerned he is injured			0
‘ he is a guy we all look up to and you definitely know he is in the team			0
if you make a mistake or take things easy , he is the first one to let you know			0
training : @entity63 said a long absence for @entity2 would be a huge blow for the @entity88 club ‘ everything is a bit quieter when he is not around			2
he ’s an important player for us and has experience of playing in big @entity5 games			0
‘ i hope he can recover in time because you want your best players available for such important matches			0
‘ we will have to wait and see but we have a lot of good players at @entity1 and i am sure whoever comes in will do a great job			1
’ watching on : @entity102 had 11 days off between @entity105 's @entity104 campaign and @entity1 pre-season meanwhile , @entity102 insists he is happy to be back at work with @entity1 despite his @entity104 call - up denying him a proper summer break			1
the 26 - year - old only managed 11 days off between returning from @entity111 with the @entity105 squad and heading out to join his club ’s training camp in @entity9			1
@entity102 , attracting attention from @entity116 and @entity117 , is expected to sit out tuesday ’s friendly with @entity118 but could play against @entity119 on friday			2
and he is keen to return to business with the opening @entity5 qualifier now just a week away			2
joking around : @entity102 and @entity122 enjoy themselves in training with goalkeeper coach @entity125 ‘ we ’ve all been apart for quite a bit of time so it ’s good when you come back in and see people you ’ve not really seen in six weeks and have a joke and a laugh , ’ he told the @entity1 website			1
‘ the serious business comes around so quickly , though , and we have competitive @entity5 games two weeks into pre-season so you have to come back and hit the ground running			2
‘ every day you ’re preparing for that first game so it ’s important you come back in good shape and give training 100 per cent every day until it kicks off			0
’ rest : @entity102 has a lie down with @entity125 after a strenuous training session in @entity9 @entity102 was thrilled to be part of @entity146 ’s squad , but did n’t manage any minutes on the pitch as his nation made a miserable first - round exit			2
‘ @entity150 was fantastic , ’ he insisted			0
‘ i have been around the squad in the last couple of years so it was fantastic to go to a @entity104 and a great experience			0
‘ i got another cap in the friendly in the lead up to it and it would have been nice if we had stayed in the tournament longer but that ’s the way it happened			0
