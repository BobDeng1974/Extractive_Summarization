hundreds of men use picks and drills to work away at what @entity6 called the ‘ colossal jagged mountain as high as a five - storey building ’ made of ‘ pale - brown , creamy , vanilla fudge ’			2
@entity6 – who also wrote @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 – told how huge chunks of fudge tumble down the mountain before being collected by cranes and dumped on to open wagons			0
but @entity56 and @entity20 ignore @entity7 ’s warnings and jump on the wagons which enter a tunnel that leads to the @entity60 and @entity61 where the fudge is pounded by a huge machine and cut with knives			2
