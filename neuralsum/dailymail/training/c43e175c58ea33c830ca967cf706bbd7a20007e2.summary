by @entity1 reporter published : 18:03 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 22:48 est , 11 october 2012 convicted child molester @entity2 will be allowed to keep the more than $ 900,000 he earned in state pension payments in spite of his recent sentencing of 30 to 60 years in prison			1
because of the bylaws of the @entity12 state employee 's retirement system , the former football coach will keep the hundreds of thousands of dollars he earned following his 1999 retirement from @entity15 's sports program			1
the state 's forfeiture law does not authorize the government body to go after money paid before the date of a plea or conviction , meaning he will keep everything awarded between 1999 and september 2012			1
payments stopped : @entity2 will be allowed to keep the more than $ 900,000 he earned in state pension payments in spite of his recent sentencing of 30 to 60 years in prison that said , the agency notified @entity2 he will no longer continue to receive the payments , which amount to $ 59,000 annually			1
@entity2 's lawyer says the former @entity15 assistant football coach will fight to keep his pension			1
the decision to revoke his pension - which breaks down to $ 4,908 per month - was unveiled in a letter to @entity2 , 68 , dated october 9			1
that was the same day he was sentenced in @entity38 to prison for 30 to 60 years for molesting 10 boys			0
the move by @entity42 , a state retirement plan for public employees , means @entity2 loses his entire pension , including a sum to his wife @entity47 when he dies , according to the letter first published by the @entity49 of @entity50 , @entity12 , where @entity15 , a public university , is located			1
@entity47 , who was mentioned in the court case as one of the victims said that he screamed during the abuse because he knew that mrs @entity55 was in the home , came back into the spotlight this week as she and her husband co-signed a letter to the judge slamming their own adopted son @entity61 support : wife @entity55 also wrote a letter accusing the couple 's adopted son @entity65 - who said he too had been abused - of being a thief and a liar in an extraordinary display of denial , the @entity70 said they were victims of a mass conspiracy in letters to the judge at the @entity77 courts in @entity78 , @entity12 , revealed today			2
@entity2 began working for @entity15 's football program under the late and legendary coach @entity80 in 1969			1
@entity2 is credited with creating , during the 1980s and ' 90s , the fearsome defensive squads that earned the school its reputation as @entity84 but his reputation crumbled when the @entity12 attorney general 's office released a grand jury report in november 2011 that resulted in criminal charges against him for sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years			2
shifting blame : the 69 - year - old , pictured with @entity15 team in 1999 , claimed his victims were troubled liars from unstable homes @entity2 was convicted in june on 45 counts of sex abuse , and sentenced on tuesday to spend , in all likelihood , the rest of his life behind bars			1
as the scandal unfolded in november 2011 , @entity80 and university president @entity101 were fired			0
@entity80 , 85 , died in january of lung cancer			0
@entity15 pension payments to @entity80 's widow , @entity104 , are calculated to top $ 13million			1
@entity2 to judge @entity106 , september @entity105 spent many hours reliving this ordeal			2
i looked at me , my vulnerability , my naivety ( some say stupidity ) , and my trust in @entity113 were so many people involved in the orchestration of this conviction ( media , investigators , prosecutors , ' the system ' , @entity15 , and the accusers )			1
they won ! what would be the outcome if all the accusers and their families who were investigated ? all their issues would surface			0
they would no longer be these poor , innocent people as portrayed			2
i have been blamed for all of their failures and shortcomings ... nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment , neglect , abuse , insecurity and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in @entity142 common reaction for those with low self - esteem is to blame @entity145 of walls , i saw great memories : i saw all the people who thrived with a little of our help and hope , i saw a locker room with people hugging and crying as national champs , i saw me throwing thousands of kids up in the air and them asking for @entity157 to @entity158 , @entity159 need to know what kind of person [ @entity65 ] is			0
we have forgiven him many times for all he has done to our family , thinking that he was changing his life , but he would always go back to his stealing and lies			2
he has been diagnose ( sic ) with @entity170 , but he refuses to take his medicine			0
he has had many run - ins with the law and stolen money and items from our family			0
we still love him and want the best for him , but because of his actions we can not express this to him.i use [ sic ] to believe in our protective system , but now have no faith in the police or legal system			0
to think that they can lie and get by with the lies			0
the press has been unbelievable			0
people who have not met us are writing @entity190 times [ @entity2 ] would give up his free time to make a sporting event of one of the kids he was trying to help			0
sometimes we would drive for two hours to spend time with these kids .			0
