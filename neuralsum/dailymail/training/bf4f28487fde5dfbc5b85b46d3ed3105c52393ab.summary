like mother , like daughter , so the saying goes and @entity0 and @entity1 are certainly proving it to be true			1
@entity7 family , from @entity8 , @entity9 , had suffered years of heartbreak but it seems their fortunes are finally changing after both mum and daughter landed modeling contracts on the same day			1
the pair were both signed by @entity18 last month after a spell of bad luck , which included @entity0 , 47 , having her skull smashed to pieces when she was hit by a bus			1
@entity24 , 47 , was seriously injured by a bus in 2010 but is now a model and so is her daughter , @entity27 , 20 @entity1 , 20 , scooped a top modelling contract helping to end her family 's run of awful luck since 2009 , the pair from @entity8 , @entity33 , also endured a close family bereavement and discovered husband and dad @entity35 had throat cancer , causing nearly five years of misery for the family			1
@entity27 , 20 , said : ' it comes after a lot of bad luck , but we have come through it and everything has changed			1
' it ’s all a bit of a shock , and none of my friends can believe it			0
' it just does n’t happen to normal people , or so we thought			0
we always considered ourselves an unlucky family but we have survived and that is a great piece of luck			0
' after competing in the miss @entity57 contest , @entity27 , an interior design student at @entity55 , scooped the award on february 14 at the @entity60 in @entity8 , following a series of grueling rounds			1
then she was approached by @entity18 , who offered her a modeling contract , despite having already unknowingly approached @entity0 earlier in the evening			1
like mother , like daughter : @entity0 and @entity67 strike a pose together @entity0 , a mortgage processor , said : “ we could n’t believe it when we realised we had both been asked			1
they had no idea we were related , i ’d just been there to support @entity27			1
' i ’d never imagined doing anything like that before			0
they were looking for more mature models , and they asked me if i was interested			0
' i ’ve done shoots wearing office wear , casual , dressed up and gym wear , and there ’s a chance @entity27 and i could end up doing something together			1
' it 's a big turnaround for @entity0 , who was hit by a @entity89 bus in march 2010 while crossing the road in @entity8 city centre			1
after being thrown 40 feet into the air and landing on the side of her head , doctors feared she would not survive , and she had to have a titanium plate fitted into the right hand side of her face			2
@entity0 said : “ it was a single decker bus which knocked me down			1
it was a matter of seconds and i had the phone to my ear but i do n’t remember anything else			0
' i was looking to the left and i thought it was one - way so i did n’t see the bus , and the driver did n’t think to slow down			2
' he ’d only just set off and had only gone about 40 yards and he was travelling at around 40mph			0
' the next thing i knew i was in hospital , and everything hurt			0
' during the accident , @entity0 ’s front tooth punctured her lip and the bone in the whole left side of her face was smashed into thousands of tiny fragments			1
she was also left with a fractured pelvis and cheekbones , yet she suffered no internal injuries			2
she said : ' i looked like i ’d had a stroke , and they had to completely rebuild the side of my face			2
' afterwards i could n’t dress myself or bend at all and i had to have a wheelchair for the first few weeks			0
' the work they did on my face is incredible			2
even if you look at me close up , you ca n’t tell what i went through			0
' in 2010 @entity0 was crossing a road in @entity8 when she was hit by a bus			1
she had to have extensive work done to repair the bones in her head and face			2
@entity0 and @entity35 , a 47 - year - old detective sergeant , went to the miss @entity57 pageant to support @entity27 during the final last month , along with sister @entity141 , 17			1
after being scouted in a nightclub in @entity143 , she impressed judges at the final during the eco , fitness and ball - gown rounds			2
@entity27 said : ' i was out on a night out with my friends when i was approached			2
it ’s not the sort of thing i would usually do as i ’m not a very confident person but i gave him my details and then got an email through a few days later			0
@entity1 , 20 , has already been crowned miss @entity57 this year ' i soon realised they focus on so much more than just looks , like being fit and healthy and having a personality			1
' i was a bit skeptical at first but i have never met a nicer group of girls and we had so much fun			0
' all of them were so nice and they were all screaming and shouting for me when i won			0
i never even expected to get to the final round and to win it was amazing			0
' @entity27 has automatically secured herself a place in the @entity169 contest in june , as well as looking forward to a part - time modeling career			1
she said : ' i ca n’t believe it			0
i now spend my weeks doing photo shoots ! ' the whole thing has been a massive confidence booster for me , and i ’ve really enjoyed it			0
i ’m really looking forward to doing some modeling as i think it ’s going to be a lot of fun			0
' @entity18 is a commercial agency , which specialises in providing models of all ages for magazine and tv adverts , and promotes products rather than fashion			0
@entity186 , managing director of @entity18 , said : “ i actually saw @entity0 before i saw @entity27 because she was there on the evening of the miss @entity57 final			1
' she is very slim and attractive and she had a lovely dress on			0
' i was one of the judges and the minute i saw @entity27 i knew i wanted her to win , but you just do n’t know what the others are thinking			2
i was delighted when she was announced as the winner			0
' it was only when i saw @entity27 with her parents that i realised they were related			2
the whole family are such delightful people and this could not have happened to a nicer family			0
' i could n’t believe that half of @entity0 ’s face was made of titanium			1
it was hard to even see the tiny scars , the surgeon must have had incredible skill			0
' when @entity27 ’s father told us of the terrible time the family have had , where they have suffered three blows in a row , i was so delighted that following all of this , the family now had a great reason to celebrate , and i had gained two lovely new models			1
' better times : @entity0 , 47 and daughter @entity27 , 20 , are now both models and hope they can work together .			1
