@entity15 has not commented on the sex strike , nor has his wife			1
the strike was announced at a rally on saturday of several thousand in the capital city , @entity19			0
the demonstration was organised by a coalition that is protesting recent electoral reforms , which they say will make it easier for @entity15 's party to win re-election in the parliamentary polls set for october			2

at saturday 's rally , which ended peacefully , @entity75 , leader of the @entity77 opposition party , called for @entity15 's resignation			2

' we have many means to oblige men to understand what women want in @entity2 , ' @entity16 , a lawyer , told @entity95			2
@entity96 , who is participating in the sex strike , believes their actions will raise awareness of those who have been imprisoned in @entity2			1
' it 's a good thing for us women to observe this sex strike as long as our children are in jail now			1
i believe that by observing this , we will get them released			0
' for me , it 's like fasting , and unless you fast , you will not get what you want from @entity115			0

i am used to it , but i am not sure my husband will accept , but i have to explain to him			0
' another @entity2 woman said she supports the sex strike , but she does not know if she can carry it out for a full week			1
' i do agree that we women have to observe this sex strike but i know my husband will not let me complete it			1
he may agree at first , but as far as i know him , he will change overnight , ' @entity130 said			0
' so i do n't believe i can do the one - week sex strike			2
otherwise , i will have serious issues with him			0
he likes that too much			0
' though the call for a sex strike seemed to please many women , some men , including heads of opposition parties and human rights groups in the @entity140 coalition , did not believe it would be a success			1
the women 's sex strike is the latest in a string of recent protests calling for the resignation of the president @entity15			1
a peaceful protest on saturday shows a man holding a sign which reads , ' @entity154 ' and cites an article of the constitution that protesters say gives them the right to engage in civil disobedience , during an opposition sit - in in @entity19 , @entity2 ' one week sex strike is too much , ' said @entity75 of the @entity162 , who suggested a shorter period , amid laughter from the crowd at the demonstration			1
' @entity167 for only two days			0
' others were skeptical of @entity16 's call			0
' it is easy for her to say because she is not married herself			0
she does not live with a man at home , ' said @entity173 , a @entity2 journalist			0
' does she think women who live with their husband will be able to observe that ? by the way , who controls what couples do behind closed doors ? '			0

@entity15 family has ruled @entity2 for 45 years
