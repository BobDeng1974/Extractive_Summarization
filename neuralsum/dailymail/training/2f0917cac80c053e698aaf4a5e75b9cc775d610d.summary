chancellor @entity0 announced a new ‘ diverted profits tax ’ in last week 's @entity1 a new ‘ @entity7 tax ’ on giant @entity9 firms shifting their profits abroad was ridiculed today after it emerged businesses will have to report themselves to the taxman			1
the levy , which was introduced by @entity0 in last week ’s @entity1 , is overwhelmingly backed by the public			1
but it emerged today that under the new scheme companies will be asked to ‘ self - report ’ how much tax they have avoided			1
one tax expert said : ‘ it 's a bit like reporting yourself to the police and then having to defend yourself			2
’ @entity23 , head of taxation at the @entity25 , added : ‘ it seems strange that multinationals would have to report themselves and the the onus is on them to defend their [ tax activities			2
] ’ but a @entity32 source stressed the new tax would be hard to avoid			1
' this is a legal requirement			0
we are going to check up on it and it will be enforced , ' the source said			0
the @entity32 estimates the @entity7 tax will raise just £ 25million in 2015 - 16 – rising to £ 355million by 2019 - 20			1
mr @entity0 last week claimed the new ‘ diverted profits tax ’ – targeting firms who ‘ export ’ profits to countries with lower corporation taxes than @entity46 – would raise £ 1billion over five years			1
many large technology companies are based in @entity48 due to the country 's 12.5 per cent corporation tax			0
the same tax in the @entity46 is 20 per cent			2
despite the controversy over the tax the government will take encouragement from new polling which reveals it is the most popular policy included in the @entity1 last week			1
according to a new @entity59 / @entity58 poll six in ten @entity46 say the new tax on the profits of companies who operate in the @entity46 but transfer their profits offshore is good for them personally			2
the plans , outlined in the @entity1 , aim to clamp down on companies such as @entity7 and @entity67 who declare their profits in countries with lower taxes than the @entity46			1
the ‘ @entity7 tax ’ was even more popular than the stamp duty cuts announced by mr @entity0			1
the publication of the new rules comes after @entity75 ’s ambassador to the @entity46 vigorously defended @entity7 and other multinational firms yesterday			1
@entity77 leapt to the defence of the giant corporations which have come under fire for their tax policies , saying they were simply following international tax rules laid down by governments			0
@entity85 warned in october that multinationals which exploit loopholes to avoid paying @entity46 taxes would be made to ‘ damn well pay ’			0
@entity9 ambassador @entity77 told journalists it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘ international tax dodgers ’ @entity7 chairman @entity93 has previously said if tax rules were to change his firm ' will comply ' mr @entity77 told journalists in @entity97 it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘ international tax dodgers ’ despite the fact they pay little , if any , corporation tax in this country			2
‘ i ’m not the spokesman for any of those great @entity9 companies , ’ he said			0
‘ these companies and other companies … are clever about using international rules that exist , as written , by the way , by all of us – that ’s @entity9 government , @entity46 government – we make these rules and they are playing by them			0
‘ and i hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well			0
’ @entity67 is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the @entity46 for the last two years			0
@entity7 , which generated more than £ 3.5billion from the @entity46 last year , paid just over £ 20million in corporation tax			1
and @entity119 , which sold goods worth £ 4.3billion in the @entity46 last year , paid just £ 4.2million			0
the firms all insist that they are operating within the international tax rules			0
but their behaviour has sparked mounting anger in the @entity46 .			0

@entity126 was introduced by @entity0 in last week ’s @entity1
@entity32 say it will raise just £ 25m in 2015 - 16 , rising to £ 355m by 2019 - 20
but *critics* say it is like asking *people* to report themselves to the police
' @entity7 tax ' is overwhelmingly backed by the public , according to new poll
@entity32 insist new tax is a ' legal requirment ' and will be hard to avoid
