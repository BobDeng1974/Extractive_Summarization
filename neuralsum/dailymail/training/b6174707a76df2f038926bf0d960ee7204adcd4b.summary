by @entity0 published : 17:46 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 02:21 est , 31 january 2013 football referee @entity1 failed to live up to his name after denying a gambler a £ 500,000 win			1
the @entity6 official denied the punter the huge windfall after blowing for full time just one second before a crucial goal went in			2
a man from @entity11 , who does not wish to be named , had put a wager on a series of unlikely scores in cup football matches this weekend including @entity16 to beat @entity17 3 - 1			1
last gasp : @entity17 , in black and grey , take a free kick from the right hand side in a bid for a late equaliser			0
goalkeeper @entity23 , in green , is even in the penalty box defended : a @entity16 player manages to head the ball clear and it looks as if @entity17 's chance has gone tables turned : a @entity16 midfielder feeds the ball to @entity32 who has free run to @entity17 's goal as goalkeeper @entity23 can do nothing incredibly , all the results had come in except the match at @entity38 which seemed destined to finish agonisingly close at 2 - 1			1
but in the dying seconds of injury time , with @entity17 ' keeper @entity23 up for a corner , @entity16 cleared the ball and it was left to midfielder @entity32 to pump it into an empty net from long range			1
he duly took his shot , but just one second before the ball rolled across the line the referee signalled the end of the match			2
open goal : @entity16 midfielder @entity32 prepares to fire the ball into an empty net as @entity17 goalkeeper @entity23 is behind him moments from glory : the ball looks set to go in , but the referee @entity1 has already blown for full time denied : the ball trickles over the line and would have made the score line 3 - 1 ... if only the ref had n't already blown his whistle pleading : @entity16 players protest that the goal should stand with referee @entity1 but to no avail unlucky ticket : the betting slip which shows how agonisingly close the punter was to a perfect set of scores @entity16 midfielder @entity32 , in white , battling with @entity17 midfielder @entity71 during the match @entity16 players , including @entity74 , protested vigorously but did n't take their complaints any further having won the tie in any case			1
not living up to his name : referee @entity1 blew the whistle just one second before the crucial goal the accumulator bet , which also included @entity11 to beat @entity82 3 - 2 , @entity83 to get knocked out of the cup by @entity85 3 - 2 and @entity87 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity88 , would have netted the unlucky gambler £ 506,562 if the goal had gone in			1
not all has been lost however , as he still walked away with £ 17,055.80 for his ' lucky 15 ' bet at @entity92			0
@entity93 , of @entity92 , said : ' the referee has ruined our punter ’s dream			0
' seventeen grand is sweet enough but he was literally one second away from having his life changed forever			0
' bookies heralded sunday ’s results as some of the biggest shocks of all time as all three odds - on @entity6 favourites failed to win against lower league opposition			0
the @entity109 bet involved 15 , 20p bets on four correct score predictions : four singles , six doubles , four trebles and an accumulator			0
they were @entity87 2 @entity88 2 at 18/1 , @entity16 3 @entity17 1 ( 25/1 ) , @entity11 3 @entity82 2 ( 80/1 ) , and @entity85 3 @entity83 2 ( 50/1 ) .			2

punter had bet on @entity16 to win 3 - 1 at home to @entity17 in @entity121 tie
midfielder @entity32 put ball in net with long range shot in injury time with @entity16 winning 2 - 1
referee @entity1 had already blown for full time so goal did n't stand
