police were at the centre of a furious row last night amid claims they acted unlawfully by demanding the arrest of the parents of dying @entity6			1
officers are accused of over-reaching their powers by issuing a @entity9 for the five - year - old ’s parents @entity11 , 51 , and @entity12 , 45			1
senior lawyers said there was little evidence the pair had committed any offence or that police undertook a satisfactory criminal inquiry			1
barrister @entity36 said police risk appearing as the ‘ enforcement arm of medical opinion ’			1
‘ the police are there to protect citizens and the easy transition to uncritical enforcers of other powerful interest groups is troubling , ’ he said			2
‘ we should remind ourselves that this was a case of two adults who had parental control , who lawfully took their child from a hospital , and by all accounts cared for his welfare in an attempt to give him a chance at life			2
’ the @entity21 are now being held in a @entity24 jail five hours ’ drive from their son who is alone and under guard in hospital			1
by obtaining a @entity9 , investigators accused them of ‘ child cruelty ’			0
now the @entity21 find themselves trapped in a legal nightmare , following their arrest on saturday night at a hotel in @entity68			1
counter-argument : @entity70 , laywer for @entity72 couple @entity11 and @entity73 speaks to the press outside @entity75 in @entity76 and said the couple were victims of false detention and libel lawyers said the arrest warrant appears to have been used as a ‘ tool ’ to find the family , rather than as a method to catch suspected criminals			1
they said warrants are normally granted only when officers are ready to lay charges , whereas any inquiry in @entity23 had barely got under way			0
@entity92 , who specialises in extradition cases at @entity96 law firm @entity94 , said he was deeply concerned at the @entity21 ’ treatment			2
he said : ‘ my concern is that they are seeking to use this warrant while their investigations are ongoing and that is most unusual			0
we have not been told if the couple involved have committed any crime			0
they can not be charged with abducting their own child			0
there was no protection order in place regarding the boy so they have not absconded with the child against the orders of a court			0
’ in a further twist , lawyers said @entity6 could have dual nationality because he was born in @entity24			1
as a result , the authorities may regard him as @entity24 and refuse to allow him to be returned to @entity72 against the wishes of his parents			0
yesterday @entity124 revealed that @entity6 was made a temporary ward of court on friday			1
this will be reviewed at the @entity128 tomorrow			0
it is not clear whether this will involve the controversial @entity131			0
last night , @entity132 refused to discuss its actions and said the matter was now in the hands of the @entity24 police			2
at the weekend assistant chief constable @entity137 said the force would not apologise for the way it conducted the search for the @entity21			0
he said it was acting on ‘ explicit medical advice ’ that @entity6 ’s life was in danger and said the warrant was based around ‘ neglect ’			1
it is understood that once @entity6 had left @entity72 , senior officers felt they had no choice but to apply for the arrest warrant to secure the co-operation of other forces			1
the @entity154 said the warrant was issued on the grounds of ‘ child cruelty ’ and the case remained ‘ under immediate review ’			0
the @entity160 , which clears @entity9 , said it looks only at the ‘ legal validity ’ of the paperwork			0
in effect this means officials simply check that the 11 - page document is correctly filled in			2
hampshire police and crime commissioner @entity166 defended the county ’s force against accusations of being ‘ heavy handed ’			2
he said : ‘ i think if @entity132 had ignored the professional medical advice and opinion then they would have been negligent in their responsibilities to safeguard @entity6			1

@entity11 and @entity175 took @entity6 from @entity176
they are now being held in @entity76 for 72 hours after extradition hearing
they were arrested in the city of @entity68 on saturday after a three - day hunt
@entity186 's lawyer says they are the victims and will sue the @entity188 and police
