the newest version of @entity1 allows players to experience sex with a prostitute from a first - person perspective			1
what 's more , players of the massively popular video game may also then beat the woman up			1
it 's all made possible in the revamping of the 2013 game for the newer @entity14 and @entity15 consoles			1
now , with new first - person mode , there 's no hiding it			1
' picking up a prostitute in first person in @entity51 is a legitimately upsetting experience , ' wrote @ @entity53 on @entity54			0
and @entity55 was n't the first , nor will he be the last , who will think so			0
not with players ' new ability to watch from behind the wheel of their stolen car as a prostitute performs oral sex on them			0
the player may then experience in first - person the act of having sex with that prostitute as she moans and says some very x-rated things			1
the icing on this controversial cake is the ability players have to then gruesomely murder their prostitute and take back their money			0
as shocking as all that may be , though , this is n't @entity38 ' first time trying to gin up sales using sex and violence			2
the company has always offered players the chance to live like sex - crazed murder hungry criminals			2
and its always worked out quite well for them			0
grand theft auto is , after all , the best selling game of all time			0
in september of last year , after the first iteration of @entity51 was released , it made a billion dollars in just three days			0
players may experience in first - person the act of having sex with that prostitute as she moans and says some very x-rated things			1
the game immediately became controversial after its tuesday release , just as most previous versions of the game have what will happen now that the game has become even more realistic ? @entity38 probably had a good idea leading up to tuesday 's re-release			2
' it 's a very intense , in - your - face experience â€¦ literally , ' says @entity107 , the animation director on @entity51 , told gaming site @entity110			2
' obviously , we felt like one of the most compelling things you could do to make an experience people have had before feel different was the new first - person mode			1
' ' this new mode gives players the chance to explore the world of @entity122 and @entity123 directly through the eyes of their character , revealing all the world 's glorious details in an entirely new way , ' @entity117 said .			0
