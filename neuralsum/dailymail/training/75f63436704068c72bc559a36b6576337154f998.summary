a @entity1 study has discovered an uncomfortable truth about children 's cereal and it 's not their sky - high sugar content : it 's the hypnotic eyes of their cartoon mascots			1
while the people on adult cereals look straight ahead , the researchers noticed that cartoon tigers , frogs , @entity14 and the like tend to stare downward			2
that allows them to gaze right into the eyes of their intended consumer , your kids -- a finding that makes sense since they also discovered that eye contact increase brand trust by 16 percent			1
grocers have long been known to place the kids stuff on lower shelves			0
but even those shelves can be above many kids ' heads			0
to make up for that , the researchers found that characters like @entity47 , @entity48 , luck the @entity49 and company look downward at an average angle of 9.67 degrees			0
meanwhile , cereal for adults -- which is placed an average of 48 inches off the ground versus the children 's 23 inches -- tends to feature people looking straight ahead			2
' why is @entity47 looking down at my child ? ' : the @entity38 study came from the @entity62 and looked at 85 characters on cereal boxes in 10 stores in @entity35 and @entity36 friends : meanwhile , the study found that people on adult cereal boxes tend to stare directly ahead , presumably into the eyes of their intended consumers , since the adult cereals are placed higher up coming back for more : the researchers also found that eye contact from characters increases ' brand trust ' by 16 percent the reason for those googly eyes is more than simply aesthetic			1
the researchers showed one version of the @entity81 rabbit that made eye contact and one that did not to to 63 college students			0
they found ' that brand trust was 16 percent higher and the feeling of connection to the brand was 10 percent higher when the rabbit made eye contact			1
' ' if you are a cereal company looking to market healthy cereals to kids , use spokes - characters that make eye contact with children to create brand loyalty , " ' @entity32 said			2
and what of sugar conscious parents who ca n't bear the thought of their children being hypnotized into eating these tempting products ? ' if you are a parent who does not want your kids to go " cuckoo for @entity106 , " ' he said , ' avoid taking them down the cereal aisle			0
