by @entity0 that @entity1 was a paedophile is known			1
but in a devastating book - serialised in the @entity4 this week - labour mp @entity0 exposes the industrial scale of his debauchery and how the @entity7 , @entity8 , police chiefs and even @entity10 covered it up			1
@entity12 , mp for @entity1 ’s old @entity14 seat , reveals how the 29 - stone monster was saved from prosecution time after time ... @entity1 , pictured celebrating being elected mp for @entity14 , would groom and abuse vulnerable teenage boys this is the story of one of @entity1 ’s victims			1
he was 16 , living with adopted parents and hungry for new experiences , when he first met @entity24 in 1979			1
his story reveals how shrewdly @entity1 would groom favoured boys — and how ruthlessly he then abused them			1
a loud voice was booming outside the window			1
a big black @entity29 was crawling around our council estate with a @entity32 blaring out ‘ @entity33 ’			1
a huge figure got out , strode purposefully across the road and knocked on our door			1
i opened it and stared at this smiling hulk of a man			1
are you interested in politics , lad ? ’ ‘ yes , i am			1
’ his face lit up			1
‘ then perhaps i ’ve got a new recruit			1
why do n’t you come and join us ? ’ i did just that , stuffing envelopes at his parliamentary campaign hq and speaking to voters on doorsteps as he campaigned in the @entity53			2
i went to the count at the @entity55 to watch him win			2
the cheers nearly shook the building as @entity1 was returned as the town ’s mp for the fourth time			1
i was working in a textile mill at the time			2
i ’d never known my real mother , my dad was in prison and i ’d been put up for adoption at an early age			2
i was searching for excitement , risk , purpose			2
@entity1 seemed to promise it			1
you could tell he did n’t live by the same rules as the rest of us			2
it was n’t long before i was a close member of his team and spending more and more time at his office			1
i watched with awe at how he tended to constituents ’ problems			2
he ’d listen attentively as someone told him how they needed a bigger council house for their family , then he ’d pick up the phone and the council would leap to attention and sort out whatever he wanted			2
@entity1 seemed to have complete control over the public sector in @entity14			1
if you became a friend of @entity1 ’s , he ’d make sure he looked after you			1
‘ you want to be a magistrate ? ’ he ’d ask			2
‘ leave it to me			2
’ he was well in with the free - masons , too			2
he could always get something done by calling a contact			2
in 1980 , @entity1 took me to the @entity8 conference in @entity102			1
we stayed in the @entity104 and i loved it			2
@entity1 could see i was completely overawed			1
he laughed and tousled my hair			2
method : @entity1 's victim met him while he was out campaigning with a car using a @entity32 , as in this picture back in @entity14 , he asked me to come for a drive late at night			1
‘ let me get my mum to bed first , ’ he said , and then he picked me up			2
@entity1 was dressed in his pyjamas and slippers			1
he drove us up into the @entity118 and pulled up by a stone wall in a remote spot			2
i remember looking at his huge clenched fist on the handbrake			0
i could see the whites of his knuckles			0
‘ i ’m not going to be in politics for ever , ’ he said			0
‘ if you stick with me , i ’ll make sure you ’re the next mp for @entity14			1
i ’ll show you the ropes , i ’ll groom you			0
it can be yours if you want it			0
’ his face was an inch away from mine now and i could smell his breath			0
the leather seats squeaked as his weight shifted towards me			0
as he spoke , his hand slid down my inside leg and he began to pull me towards him			0
i know now i should have screamed and punched him in the face			0
i should have got out of that car and never turned back			0
i sat there frozen as he groped me , moaning and groaning and burying his face in my neck			0
i did n’t say a word			0
in the years that followed , i lost count of how many times he did this to me			0
i could tell by the look on his face that he knew he had complete control over me			0
my background meant i had hardly any confidence or self - esteem			0
i ’d never had a girlfriend and @entity1 ’s world was exciting and unpredictable			1
he treated me like a sex object			0
i got used to seeing dark clouds of lust cross his eyes — then he ’d create opportunities for us to be alone			0
at one point , he even groped me in @entity167			0
he ’d taken me there a few times and introduced me to all kinds of people			0
i remember meeting @entity173 leader @entity172 and watching the pair of them laughing hysterically at things that were n’t in the slightest bit funny			0
i wondered if you had to be mad to get into that place			0
in @entity1 ’s office there he was all over me — with the door open , too			1
politicians walked past , but no one said anything			1
it was as though different laws applied to the people there			0
' the door was open ' : his victim says he will never forget how @entity1 , pictured with then @entity8 leader @entity193 in 1977 , abused him in the @entity194 eventually , i was tired of being used			1
he ’d taken what little self - respect i had and trampled all over it			0
he ’d made dignity a foreign word to me			0
sometimes i looked in the mirror and felt sick at what i saw			0
i even dreamed of killing him			0
everyone has a breaking point , and i now saw @entity1 for what he was — a fat , middle - aged , lonely man who liked abusing boys			1
his problem was that he ’d become intoxicated with power			0
he was reckless and took risks , but he knew he ’d get away with it			0
by 1985 , i was married and left @entity14 and @entity1 behind for good			1
when he died , i could n’t watch the simpering politicians on tv as they fawned over him and talked of his legacy			1
he was cremated , but if he ’d been buried i would have torn his gravestone down			0
i phoned the chief executive of @entity14 council and told him if they built a statue in memory of him i ’d personally get a digger and demolish it			1
hate is a powerful emotion and it ’s one that i fight with constantly			0
i do n’t want to be owned by it , but i ca n’t forgive @entity1			1
how on earth can a politician get away with molesting 16 - year - old boys ? and how many more were there like me ? you know the thing that ’s stayed with me most ? it ’s his laugh			1
utterly mirthless , loud and hollow			0
sometimes i can still hear it now			0
