by @entity0 @entity1 and sister @entity2 whose baby she 's carrying when @entity4 was told she could not have any more children after battling cervical cancer , she was left heartbroken			1
life - saving treatment meant the mother - of - one would be left infertile and unable to give her daughter @entity9 , two , a little brother or sister			1

but their bond grew stronger when mrs @entity4 was diagnosed with cancer in december 2012 after a routine smear test			2
she said : ‘ i urgently needed intense radiotherapy and chemotherapy			0
@entity12 and i desperately wanted a sibling for @entity9 but it would destroy my eggs and leave my uterus too scarred to carry a baby			2
’ when she told her family the heartbreaking news , her sister instantly volunteered to carry a baby for her			2
@entity12 and @entity4 with their daughter @entity9 ‘ as soon as i said it , it felt right , ’ said miss @entity1			1
‘ we ’d always adored being one of four and i could n’t imagine her just having one child			0

‘ incredibly i found out on @entity2 ’s birthday			0
we were out walking in the park with @entity9 when i broke the news			0

so i ’ve never worried i wo n’t be able to hand him to @entity2 when the time comes			0
’ mrs @entity4 , who now has the all - clear from cancer , said : ‘ my mum and i will be at @entity15 ’s side when she gives birth while @entity12 will wait outside the delivery room			1
