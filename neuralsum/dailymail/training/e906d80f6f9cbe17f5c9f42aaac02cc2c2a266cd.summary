by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 22:31 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 00:39 est , 17 august 2013 even as @entity4 has ramped up its investigation into the kidnapping of @entity7 , which so far has yielded extensive communication between the 16 - year - old and her abductor , officials empathized friday that the teen is considered a victim			1
search warrants made public earlier this week showed that @entity16 's letters to @entity17 - the man suspected to murdering her mother and brother before abducting her - were found at his burned home			1
on friday , sheriff 's spokeswoman @entity22 reiterated previous statements made by sheriff @entity25 , who unequivocally said that @entity7 ‘ was not a willing participant			2
‘ our follow - up investigation has not changed that sentence			0
’ on thursday , @entity16 stepped out in public for the first time since she was rescued by federal agents less than a week ago			1
the 16 - year - old wore sunglasses , a blue top and short jean shorts as she attended a fundraiser with friends and supporters in @entity34 , @entity35 less than a week after her ordeal ended			0
it comes as questions remain over what exactly happened when she was kidnapped by @entity66 , a family friend who killed her mother and 8 - year - old brother before abducting her and taking her to @entity70 where @entity72 officers shot him dead			2
many questions remain about the timeline of events on the day when @entity76 and @entity16 were killed : why did @entity7 exchange 13 calls with @entity17 in the hours leading up to the attack ? how exactly were they killed ? and how was @entity17 able to restrain and kill them without @entity7 knowing before they drove off together ? police have not explained any of these issues publicly , but they have released the search warrants filled out by investigators at @entity17 's house , listing pages of evidence that they took with them to help piece together his relationship to the @entity93 - and @entity7 in particular			1
@entity94 county sheriff @entity25 has been adamant that @entity7 was an unwilling victim from start to finish			2
" i ca n't make it any clearer , " he said at a news conference monday			0
she has spoken to friends and strangers over social media and released a number of pictures of herself via her @entity105 account but the first time she was seen publicly came thursday evening when she went to a fundraiser for her family			0
her mother @entity76 and 6 - year - old brother @entity110 were killed and their bodies were set on fire by their family friend @entity114 , who ' tricked ' them into coming to his home and then killed the mother and brother before running off with @entity7 and being shot dead six days later			1
@entity7 was only briefly seen walking from their car into the back entrance of a @entity94 restaurant where the fundraiser was being held			2
support : her father said that she is happy to be home and among friends @entity7 's appearance at the fundraiser comes the same day as a growing list of evidence recovered at @entity17 's house has been revealed , including firebombs , military assault rifle ammunition , and handwritten ' letters from @entity136 ' to @entity17			1
one of the most puzzling pieces added to the ongoing investigation into this crime is that a dna test kit was found in the burnt out car that once belonged to @entity142			1
@entity143 reports that other items listed in the search warrants released today include ' crow bars and other weapons , instruments and objects capable of inflicting blunt force trauma ' , as well as bomb - making materials like gas cans , various types of duct tape and arson wire			1
a number of personal items that could potentially be used for dna collection were also gathered , including clothing and toothbrushes but also used condoms			0
the meaning behind the items was not listed , as emergency responders appear to have grabbed as many items as possible on august 5 as they tried to get a better idea of @entity7 's relationship with @entity17 as they were missing			1
what remained : firefighters found the bodies of @entity76 and @entity16 covered with tarp , showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down @entity114 's @entity173 ( pictured ) the 13 calls between @entity17 and @entity7 on the day of her abduction remain curious , though @entity4 's spokeswoman @entity22 said that they may have been discussing what time she needed to be picked up from cheerleading practice			1
today , @entity7 did not make a statement to the awaiting press , but her father @entity181 came outside and made a statement , saying that his daughter was happy to be home			2
' she 's with her family and of course with some friends and she 's just happy to be here , ' he said thursday			0
' @entity7 sends her love and she keeps moving day by day			0
' the fundraiser was largely attended by relatives and friends within their neighborhood , and mr @entity16 cited their strong support as helping them through			0
' this is a small community that we 're a part of and they really came together ... this is how @entity34 rolls , ' he said			0
he also said that he has spoken with the four horseback riders who spotted @entity7 in the @entity70 woods with @entity17 and called police			2
' it was a chance encounter but it did save my daughter 's life , ' he said			0
@entity207 turned spokesman : @entity181 stepped outside and said a few words , telling how he was so thankful for the national support that helped lead to his daughter 's rescue spreading the love : @entity181 said he spoke with the four horsemen who spotted @entity7 with @entity17 and called police , leading to her recovery the fundraiser came the day after a search warrant revealed that @entity7 's mother and brother were both killed and tortured before @entity17 's cabin set on fire			1
a police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about @entity17 's cabin being burnt to ashes in @entity173 , @entity35 on august 5th			1
they found the bodies covered with tarp , and a crowbar lying next to @entity76			0
when the responders went to the garage to check for more victims , they found the @entity16 's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head			0
the details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant , but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there - and that there was blood coming from the dog 's head - implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home .			0

comes the same day as new search warrants made public that list piles of evidence that the first responders collected at @entity17 's burnt house
' @entity270 ' among the evidence at her kidnapper 's house , along with ' possible blunt force weapons ' and bomb making materials
