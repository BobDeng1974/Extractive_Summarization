@entity1 rugby head coach @entity0 took part in a high - powered sports think - tank involving @entity5 and sir @entity6 at @entity7 this week			1
the summit at the resort hotel outside @entity10 , @entity11 , was organised by the leaders in @entity14 brand , allowing elite coaches to get together in a private environment to swap ideas and strategies			0
the venue was chosen so that @entity20 could play a part despite being in the middle of a crucial international week that culminates in a test against @entity25 on saturday after a disappointing autumn series			1
@entity0 attended a think tank this week in the build - up to @entity1 's test match against @entity25 there will be some surprise within rugby that @entity0 , who regularly speaks on leadership topics , wanted to participate in such a meeting during @entity1 ’s run of four november games			1
the organisers , who put on their p8 summits loosely based on the @entity41 political meets in the @entity42 and the @entity43 , said @entity0 ‘ popped in ’ when he could during the wednesday session , between his rugby duties on the squad ’s day off			1
as well as @entity20 , @entity49 and @entity5 , the @entity48 included @entity14 director of performance @entity50 and @entity52 who heads @entity54 ’s high - performance athlete development programme			1
the @entity56 award went once again — as @entity57 predicted — to an obscure tome , this time about the rape trial of an @entity60 , rather than either of the acclaimed front runners , @entity63 ’s autobiography and the @entity65 biography			1
the elitist panel , as they have done for most of the last 26 years judging this prestigious award , much prefer to be different rather than populist			2
the first prize includes a free £ 2,500 bet which last year ’s winning author @entity71 safely staked on @entity72 winning the @entity73 by - election at odds of 1 - 10			2
@entity76 poses after winning the 2014 @entity56 on thursday @entity78 ’s belated decision to sever all links with 77 - year - old vice-president @entity80 after his sexist remarks should lead to the @entity78 revising their scandalous decision to allow referee grandee @entity83 to remain in office following racist comments to a black colleague			1
click here to read @entity88 earlier column detailing @entity91 's resignation from the @entity78 's referee academy the county @entity78 made a u-turn on not taking further action against @entity80 after he was banned for four months by the @entity78 for telling junior referee @entity96 that a woman ’s place was in the kitchen			2
so the @entity78 should think again about @entity83 , who was playing an active role in this week ’s rules - governing @entity103 meeting in @entity104 , after he was only slapped on the wrist for asking a black colleague whether his tan was the result of going down a coal mine			1
@entity80 told @entity96 ( above ) that her place was ' in the kitchen ' and not within football lord @entity113 has turned to bid spinmeister @entity114 , who helped @entity116 2012 across the line , in his quest for the @entity120 presidency			0
@entity114 knows all the machinations of such a campaign with successes including @entity124 landing the @entity125 and the unlikely appointment of @entity127 as chief of cycling ’s @entity129			0
lord @entity113 has turned his attentions to spinmeister @entity114 in his quest for the @entity120 presidency @entity133 tipped for @entity72 @entity72 will be targeting @entity136 leader @entity135 ’s seat in @entity137 after research published yesterday showed they could win it			0
this adds more intrigue to a fascinating rumour that @entity72 will approach @entity143 - based right - winger sir @entity133 to contest the seat			2
@entity145 pundit @entity133 said curtly he would n’t discuss such ‘ garbage ’ while cricket is mourning @entity147			0
cricket - loving @entity72 leader @entity149 , who describes sir @entity133 as his ultimate hero , said he knew nothing about any such approach , but added : ‘ i do n’t know everything that goes on in my party but i would be over the moon if it happened			0
’ sir @entity133 said he would n't discuss such ' garbage ' concerning contesting @entity72 seat following the tragic death of @entity161 cricketer @entity147 the three current @entity163 members , as @entity57 revealed , still being investigated by @entity43 lawyer @entity164 over corruption relating to @entity167 bids are @entity169 ’s @entity168 , @entity171 ’s @entity170 and @entity173 ’s @entity172			0
serial corruption allegations surround makudi , @entity174 headed @entity169 ’s alleged vote collusion with @entity177 and @entity170 ’s involvement suggests @entity171 ’s bid was not as squeaky - clean as reported			0
