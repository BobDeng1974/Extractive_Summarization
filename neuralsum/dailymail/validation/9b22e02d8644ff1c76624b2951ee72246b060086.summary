it 's an age - old adage , but looking on the bright side of life can be good for your health , scientists said today			0
adopting a positive mental attitude lowers the risk of suffering a heart attack , requiring surgery and even death			1
that is according to a new study by a group of scientists at @entity15			2
the research found after suffering a heart attack or angina , the most pessimistic patients were twice as likely to suffer a more serious health condition in the next four years , compared with the most optimistic patients			1
these conditions include a more severe heart attack , heart surgery or death			1
a new study by researchers at @entity15 has found optimists are less likely to suffer a heart attack , heart surgery or die in the years after suffering an initial heart attack or angina in the @entity34 , 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease , the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina ( the type that does n't occur upon exertion but strikes randomly , and persists even at rest )			1
meanwhile in the @entity43 , around 375,000 people die each year from coronary heart disease			2
scientists surveyed the mental attitudes of 369 patients , who were admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks			1
they monitored the patients ' health over the next 46 months			2
led by @entity54 professor @entity53 , the team noted their findings could be linked to a number of physical and psychological impacts of being optimistic			0
half of the most pessimistic patients who smoked were still smoking one year after going into hospital			2
in contrast , 85 per cent of the optimistic smokers had quit their habit entirely , a year on			0
smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina , with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking			1
the research comes ahead of @entity71 next wednesday , when the @entity54 will call on smokers to quit for good			0
the study also showed that optimistic patients are more likely to increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables , a year after their heart attack or angina			1
the study found pessimists were more likely to smoke and live an unhealthy lifestyle - factors linked to poor heart health forty per cent with a positive outlook were eating the recommended five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day			1
meanwhile only 20 per cent of the most pessimistic patients were eating the required amounts , 12 months after their hospital admission			0
lead author of the research , professor @entity53 , said : ' our research shows that optimistic people are more likely to take advice about lifestyle changes on board , like quitting smoking and eating more healthily â€“ this results in better outcomes after a patient suffers from unstable angina or a heart attack			1
' our findings could be used to identify pessimistic patients and encourage them to make the necessary changes to their lifestyle that can ultimately lead to better health			0
' dr @entity111 , associate medical director at the @entity54 , said : ' the next steps for this research would be to show psychotherapy like cognitive behavioural therapy to improve optimism can improve the outcomes for pessimistic people			0
' suffering from a serious condition like angina or heart attack can take a drastic emotional toll , which we know can lead to depression , further lowering the chances of a full recovery after a heart attack			1
' if you 're living with a heart condition and struggling to cope , we would urge you to contact your gp who can put you in touch with the necessary support			0
' although noting a more optimistic approach promoted a patient 's recovery by encouraging a healthier lifestyle , researchers did not find optimistic people were more physically active			0
in the past depression has also been linked to poor outcomes for heart patients			2
this study found pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina			1
the scientists hope their findings will help identify the patients most at risk of suffering serious health complications in the years after recovering from heart problems			2
the study was published in @entity153			0
there are two types of angina , called stable and unstable angina			1
the symptoms of these two types are similar , but there are some important differences			0
attacks of stable angina usually occur when the heart is forced to work harder , for example during physical activity or emotional stress			2
in some cases , the pain can also develop after eating a meal or during cold weather			0
these are known as angina triggers			0
the symptoms of stable angina usually improve if you rest for a few minutes			0
unstable angina is more unpredictable			1
it can develop without any obvious triggers and can persist even when you are resting			0
attacks of unstable angina may last longer than a few minutes and do not always respond to treatments used for stable angina			1

@entity15 study shows optimists were less likely to suffer a heart attack or die
looked at heart attack patients and those *diagnosed* with unstable angina
found pessimists were twice as likely to suffer a second , severe heart attack , heart surgery or die up to four years after their first illness
