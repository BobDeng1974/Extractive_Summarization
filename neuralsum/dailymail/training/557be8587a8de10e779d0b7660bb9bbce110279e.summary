@entity0 today issues a highly personal plea to the people of @entity3 not to ‘ rip apart ’ the @entity4			1
writing in the @entity6 , the prime minister tells @entity3 that the rest of the @entity4 ‘ desperately wants you to stay ’			1
but he warns there will be no second chances after next week ’s referendum : ‘ if the @entity4 breaks apart , it breaks apart for ever			1
mr @entity0 also puts party hostilities aside to back a last - ditch plan unveiled by his former foe @entity32 to fast - track new powers for @entity34			0
‘ our message to the @entity3 people will be simple : we want you to stay , ’ he writes			1
‘ together , the @entity4 embodies the values the world looks on with awe and envy			1
’ with panic growing in @entity48 over a surge in support for independence , mr @entity0 , @entity44 ’s @entity43 and @entity46 leader @entity45 have taken the extraordinary step of agreeing to abandon prime minister ’s questions today			1
instead , they will make unscheduled trips to @entity3 to try to rally the faltering no campaign			2
plea : in a passionate article in today 's @entity6 , the prime minister issues a rallying cry to voters of @entity3 new offer : @entity0 's article in today 's @entity6 comes after the three main @entity48 parties united to offer @entity3 and @entity66 ( right ) , extra devolved powers in the bid to save the 307 - year - old @entity19 history : the pair signed an agreement to hold the referendum in 2012 ( pictured ) - now just a few days remain in other developments : with opinion polls suggesting the referendum is now too close to call , mr @entity66 dismissed @entity48 ’s promises about more powers			1
‘ this is the day the no campaign finally disintegrated and fell apart at the seams , ’ the first minister said			2
‘ together , @entity0 , @entity43 and @entity45 are the most distrusted @entity48 politicians ever – and their collective presence in @entity3 will be another massive boost for the @entity85 campaign			1
‘ the message of this extraordinary , last - minute reaction is that the @entity48 elite are in a state of absolute panic as the ground in @entity3 shifts under their feet			1
’ anger : @entity66 prompted ridicule by comparing the vote to @entity98 's elections after @entity99 disarray : the first attempt to raise the @entity3 flag above @entity102 failed - on live tv			1
after starting to be hoisted the workers were watched on as it fluttered back down due to an ill - fitting attachment yesterday the @entity107 , was finally raised above no 10 as @entity48 politicians headed north to try and save the @entity19 there were also reports that the first minister had made provocative remarks about his threat to default on @entity3 ’s share of the @entity4 ’s national debt if the pound was not shared			1
sources close to the @entity3 leader told @entity118 he had exclaimed : ‘ what are they going to do ? invade ? ’ in a desperate bid to halt the momentum of the campaign for independence , mr @entity32 this week returned to frontline politics to propose a rapid timetable to give the @entity127 greater control over finance , welfare and taxation			1
he said yesterday : ‘ this proposal means faster change , fairer change , safer change and better change			0
faster change because these powers can be in place very quickly.the major pro-devolution parties have told me they agree with that timetable			0
’ the prime minister had not planned to be in @entity3 until early next week , when he is expected to make another visit			1
do n't tear it apart by prime minister @entity0 as the people of @entity3 put pen to ballot paper next week , you will be writing the @entity4 ’s future in indelible ink			1
it ’s a momentous decision : there will be no going back			0
that is why the main party leaders – @entity43 , @entity45 and @entity156 – have agreed the right place for us to be today is in @entity3 , not at @entity159 in @entity48			2
there is a lot that divides us , but there ’s one thing on which we agree passionately : the @entity4 is better together			1
at this crucial moment , we want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choices they face			0
our message to the @entity3 people will be simple : ‘ we want you to stay			1
’ it ’s difficult to put into words what our @entity4 represents			1
this is the group of small islands in the @entity175 that have punched above our weight for centuries – and we ’ve done so together			0
dramatic : the ' yes ' vote took a surge in the last few days and the two sides are now roughly neck - and - neck when the world wanted representation , we gave them democracy			2
when they wanted progress , we had the @entity3 enlightenment and the industrial revolution			2
when slavery bound innocent people , we abolished it ; when fascism threatened freedom , we defeated it			0
a hundred years ago , our boys went off to war together – and they did so as comrades , united by purpose and hope for a better world			0
as individuals and as nations , we have done extraordinary things			0
this is the special alchemy of the @entity4 – you mix together @entity3 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 and together we smash expectations			1
and that ’s just as true today as it ’s ever been			0
together we ensure that the sick are cared for in our @entity214 ; that no one has to reach for their credit card to get decent medical help			0
together we ensure dignity and security for our elderly , with a pension system that we all pay into , from @entity222 to @entity223			0
together , the @entity4 embodies the values that the world looks on with awe and envy			1
just because our countries are great together , that does not mean we can not be even better			0
that is why a no vote does n’t mean a vote for the status quo – no does n’t mean no change			0
it means significant further devolution for @entity3 – major new powers over tax , spending and welfare all being passed to @entity3			2
this is not about @entity3 versus the rest of the @entity4			1
it is about two competing visions of @entity3 ’s future			2
this week , the no campaign set out more detail on this			0
power for @entity3 over how much money it borrows , what taxes it raises , how it spends that money – all agreed by november , all put into draft legislation by january			2
this is the package that @entity32 outlined on monday			0
it is one i wholeheartedly support			0
because we know that brighter future for @entity3 rests not only on staying in the @entity4 , but also on having significant new powers			1
this is the sort of clarity you need as you make this decision , knowing how it will affect your life , your job , the security of your country , the money in your pocket – especially when you ’re not just making this decision for yourself , but for your children , your grandchildren , and their children too			0
@entity276 plans : power for @entity3 over how much money it borrows , what taxes it raises , how it spends that money - all will be agreed , and all were in the package which former pm @entity32 ( pictured ) outlined this week @entity282 : @entity284 leader @entity283 and @entity44 's @entity43 raised a @entity107 yesterday with this timetable , we are giving people that clarity , showing that by voting no , @entity3 gets the best of both worlds : power over the policies that matter , and the stability of the @entity4 ; the freedom to chart its own destiny , and the support of three other nations ; the reputation in the world as a successful nation , and the clout of a world - renowned union			1
but where we offer clarity , those who support separation offer only question marks			0
just eight days away from the referendum , they are still unclear on what money @entity3 could use without the pound sterling			1
the plan for @entity3 to enter the @entity313 is a blank page			2
the formula for filling the public services funding deficit is a blank space			0
while a @entity85 vote may be a lucky dip , a no vote is a guaranteed win for anyone who wants a stronger , more autonomous @entity3			2
the @entity4 is a precious and special country			2
that is what is at stake			0
so let no one in @entity3 be in any doubt : we desperately want you to stay ; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart			2
across @entity207 , @entity209 and @entity208 , our fear over what we stand to lose is matched only by our passion for what can be achieved if we stay together			1
if we pull together , we can keep on building a better future for our children			0
we can make sure our destiny matches our history , because there really will be no second chances			0
if the @entity4 breaks apart , it breaks apart forever			0
so the choice for you is clear : a leap into the dark with a @entity85 vote , or a brighter future for @entity3 by voting no. you can have the best of both worlds in the @entity4			1
you can have more powers in @entity3			0
and you can be part of a @entity4 – standing tall , forging a more secure future in this world , building more opportunities for our children and grandchildren and the generations yet to be born			2
that is the next chapter in our history ; we can write it together – but only if @entity3 votes no next week .			0
