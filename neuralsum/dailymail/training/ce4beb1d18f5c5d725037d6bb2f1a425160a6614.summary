four - time @entity0 and five - time @entity2 champion alpine skier @entity1 , who retired from competition at the end of the 2014 season , on rivalling @entity6 , starring as a bond girl , @entity8 and how finishing 19th at @entity9 was like winning gold			1
who is your sporting hero ? @entity8			1
skiing is quite an aggressive sport and so is boxing , but he carried himself so well			2
@entity1 , the recently retired @entity2 alpine skier , says her sporting hero is @entity8 @entity18 ? it ’s always been sport for me but if i was n’t a skier i would have been a tennis player			1
i was a power hitter and could have done well in the era of @entity6 ! @entity25 would you like to be ? i ’d love to have something like the mobot so i ’d have to say @entity29			1
@entity1 likes the idea of having her own signature , such as @entity29 's famous ' @entity32 ' career highlight ? finishing 19th in @entity9 six months after i broke my leg			1
i had 1,048 minutes of surgery so to finish within two seconds of the leader was like gold for me			1
... and the worst moment ? the crashes			2
you ca n’t ski in ignorance of injury but they do define you			2
i fought back and became a positive person			2
@entity1 on her way to a remarkable 19th place in the women 's alpine skiing super combined at @entity9 if your house was burning down , what one possession would you save ? probably photographs of my mum			1
she passed away in 2006 but is still a really important person in my life			2
i wear her engagement ring to carry her with me			2
so those and maybe my coffee machine ! @entity59 ? @entity60			0
i like the @entity62 version but i always think of @entity63 singing it in @entity65			0
@entity1 thinks of this scene from the late @entity63 's @entity65 when considering her favourite karaoke song , @entity60 @entity68 - listened to song on your @entity69 ? @entity71 — @entity72 , @entity73 — @entity74 , and anything by @entity76 @entity72 was my pre-race pump - up song and in my retirement race - when i was supposed to ski slowly - it was played on the @entity78			1
i won by two seconds			0
they should have stuck to classical			0
@entity81 ? rising from the @entity82 — a great documentary about the @entity85 cycling team			0
last book you read ? i ’m reading @entity87			0
it ’s about @entity89 , a survivor from a prisoner of war camp in the @entity91			0
when it comes to music , @entity1 is a big lady gaga , @entity73 and @entity76 fan which three people would you invite to a dinner party and why ? @entity99 - she would have the most incredible stories			1
part of me would say someone like @entity103 ! but then i think @entity8 to talk and offer security			0
your favourite holiday destination ? @entity105 in terms of indulgence but i ’ve got an amazing relationship with @entity109			0
that ’s where my honeymoon was and where i ’ve done a lot of charity work			0
in a film of your life , @entity114 would you like to play you ? @entity117			0
i ’ve got a massive girl - crush on her			0
but i ’d do the stunts			0
i ’ve always felt i could do a job as a @entity123 girl if they ever need one for a skiing scene … @entity1 's girl crush is @entity117 , and the skier thinks she 'd be handy on a @entity123 film set @entity129 ... i ’m the world - record holder for beer - mat flipping			1
i took on @entity132 and did 30 in 30 seconds so i ’m in the @entity133			1
@entity1 is a supporter of @entity134 , the international sport for development and peace charity : @entity138			1

@entity1 said finishing 19th at the @entity9 six months after breaking her leg was like winning gold
off the slopes she 'd have liked to match it with tennis ace @entity6
