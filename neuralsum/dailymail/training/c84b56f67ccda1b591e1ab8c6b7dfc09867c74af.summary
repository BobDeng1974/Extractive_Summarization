with parking space at a premium in @entity2 here 's one off - road challenge that proved too much for the driver of a brand new £ 80,000 @entity6			1
the luxury 4x4 – with fewer than 500 miles on the clock – was written off when it left the road and became wedged on its side between a wall and a basement			1
incredibly , witnesses said the woman driver and three female passengers escaped unscathed from the crash in @entity18 , north of @entity19 in central @entity2			1
crash : a brand new @entity21 worth £ 80,000 came off the road in central @entity2 at 5am on sunday the gleaming white @entity21 left the road and smashed through metal railings the junction of @entity18 and @entity26 before becoming stuck at the bottom of a 14 - feet drop			1
the car , which costs more than £ 80,000 before any optional extras , was salvaged a few hours after the crash at 5am on sunday			2
but the roof was wrecked and the car appeared to be destined for the scrap yard			2
@entity35 - by @entity36 said : " i noticed the railing was smashed and there were some skid marks on the pavement , so i went over for a look			0
bang : remarkably none of the four women in the car which plunged 14 feet were injured @entity45 : the female driver lost control of the expensive car and ended up in a basement in central @entity2 " i could n't believe it when i saw this posh car stuck at the bottom			1
" that would either take a lot of skill or bad luck to land a huge car down there			0
" i spoke to one of the neighbours who said the car had four girls in it and they were all right , which in itself is a miracle			0
" i 've never seen anything like that before			0
. " the vehicle is fitted with a five - litre supercharged v8 engine which develops a whopping 510bhp			2
near miss : the white vehicle had just 500 miles on the clock when it ended up underground this gives the sporty off - roader a 0 - 62mph time of just five seconds and a top speed which is electronically limited to 155mph			1
the @entity78 said that the incident was not a matter for them and they would not be investigating			0
the luxury vehicle had a compressed and scratched black roof , and several windows were cracked and broken			0
the basement at the junction of @entity18 and @entity26 where at 5am on sunday an £ 80,000 car ended up			1
luckily the four women in the car walked away without a scratch the witness added : ‘ one side was completely crumpled			0
someone told me there were four people in it , who were n't hurt			0
‘ they 're so lucky to be alive – i suppose it just goes to show how tough those vehicles are			0
‘ i do n't think they 're designed for that type of off - roading though			0
