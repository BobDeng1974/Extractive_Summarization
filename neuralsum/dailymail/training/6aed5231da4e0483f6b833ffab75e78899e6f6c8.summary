to say it 's been a year for experimental fashion would be a bit of an understatement			1
@entity5 dared to bare all in a completely transparent spangled gown , @entity4 draped herself in metal chains and @entity8 debuted a full fur balaclava			2
but for every fashion fail , there has been a style triumph - @entity12 casts an eye over the looks we 've loved and the outfits we 've loved to loathe in 2014			2
although the gown sported 230,000 hand - sewn @entity37 crystals they were n't enough to shield the outrageous singer 's modesty - the fur stole carefully positioned around her bikini area did that			2
but as well as serious style misses , there have been huge hits such as @entity46 showing off old school movie star style in @entity48 at the @entity49 in may			0
and model of the moment @entity21 opted for a slick white strapless jumpsuit at the @entity25 this month - the perfect outfit to cement her successful transition from reality star to catwalk queen			0
there was leg flashing , bum baring and more glamour than you could shake a stick at and a new generation of starlets and up - and - comers proved they had red carpet charisma in spades			1
@entity69 became a red carpet darling in a a series of stunning designer gowns during awards season @entity69 matched her red dress to the red carpet and still looked amazing in @entity76 at the @entity77 hit : @entity78 and colourful @entity69 with her award winning role in 12 years a slave @entity69 became one of the breakout stars of the year			1
but it was n't just her acting skills that got our attention			0
@entity69 quickly became a firm fashion favourite on the red carpet			1
we swooned as she wore sky blue @entity91 to the @entity30 and cheered as she rocked a bright red @entity76 cape dress to the @entity77			2
and who could forget that gorgeous turquoise @entity48 gown she wore to the @entity96 in january ? in fact @entity69 's red carpet looks even landed her a lucrative contract as the face of @entity101			1
@entity4 was barely dressed at all in an outfit constructed out of a series of chain loops and a silver thong @entity106 : @entity4 was all @entity107 when @entity4 rocked up to the @entity108 in august in this dress constructed entirely out of looped chains she got everyone talking - for all the wrong reasons			1
the mother - of - one , who recently separated from husband , rapper @entity114 , topped worst dressed lists around the globe for her barely - there attire			0
but the 31 - year - old , who is well known for her love of risque clothing was n't put off by her critics			2
in fact @entity4 continues to post videos of herself on @entity125 in little or no clothing			2
@entity127 looks sophisticated in a layered tulle shirt dress and dramatic frothy nude ballgown hit : @entity127 was fashionable in @entity130 not just a pretty face , model , actress and girlfriend of @entity135 , @entity127 has worn some seriously cute looks this year			1
in particular we were impressed by her ability to appear chic in sheer layered frills , a look usually only reserved for your grandmother 's loo - roll holder			1
it probably helps that 22 - year - old @entity127 is the face @entity147 's @entity146 clothing line , indeed , when she attended the @entity49 in @entity148 this summer it was in a custom - made dress by the fashion house			1
the @entity49 theme was @entity152 but both @entity153 and @entity154 opted for ' flamenco ' instead @entity106 : flamenco fails at the @entity49 the theme for this year 's @entity49 , the @entity49 , in @entity148 was @entity152 , unfortunately it seems that @entity153 and @entity154 did not get the memo			1
instead both women seemed to go for more of a flamenco theme			0
@entity153 wore bright yellow @entity162 with echoes of @entity164			0
@entity154 wore a black vintage @entity166 fishtail gown that made her look as she would shout , ' ol√© ! ' at any moment			0
fashion - watchers are on tenterhooks waiting to see how guests will interpret next year 's theme of @entity172			1
@entity173 looked chic and arresting in @entity76 at prince @entity175 's party at @entity176 in may @entity173 , here with @entity177 , opted for a vintage kimono - style dress at the @entity181 in february @entity173 left nothing to the imagination in transparent black lace at the @entity185 in september hit : @entity173 is back in black of course , 22 - year - old model and actress @entity173 had to make the list at some point			1
and for all her sartorial experimentation , the model looks her best when she keeps it simple			0
she stunned in a sophisticated embroidered black @entity76 gown at an event held by @entity175 at @entity176 earlier this year			0
similarly the face of @entity147 , @entity196 and @entity197 looked stylish and chic in february at the @entity181 in a vintage kimono			0
and in september , perhaps inspired by @entity5 's see - through outfit , @entity173 looked sophisticated in an entirely see - through lace number over a pair of substantial black knickers for the @entity204			1
the @entity205 was clearly @entity8 's style inspiration on a chilly march night in @entity148 @entity106 : lady gaga is covered in fur when @entity8 arrived at the @entity210 in march there was only one question on everybody 's lips : how on earth can she see where she 's going ? @entity8 , who is known for her outlandish outfits and once wore a dress made entirely of meat , went for a @entity219 - style outfit from head to toe , with a piece that covered her face , a white fur dress and thigh - high boots			2
we can only presume that the upside was that she kept nice and warm			0
@entity228 , who has modelled for @entity229 , looked breathtaking in a pink sheath dress by the designer hit : @entity232 wears calvin in @entity234 wearing hot pink on the red carpet can be a bit of a gamble given the obvious colour clash			1
but @entity241 model and mother @entity228 pulled off the look with aplomb when she attended the premiere of @entity245 in @entity234 in may			0
in a simple but striking @entity229 dress ( she has previously been chosen as the face of the brand ) @entity228 proved that when it comes to detailing sometimes less is more			0
@entity250 baffled fans with her blancmange - like @entity252 layered tulle skirt and matching blouse @entity106 : @entity250 's @entity255 @entity256 is this a shirt ? is it a dress ? well , it 's both			1
girls creator @entity250 left fashion fans confused when she teamed a little pink shirt with a giant pink layered @entity252 skirt that looked like a blancmange at the @entity266			2
but the writer , who released her memoir @entity267 this year , has long been outspoken about not caring what people think of her outfit choices			0
@entity46 wore a stunning @entity48 dress to the @entity49 , rocking an old school @entity276 glamour look @entity46 's husband @entity277 was delighted to accompany his wife to the high - profile fashion event hit : blake does old school hollywood ever since she starred in the hit @entity282 gossip girl @entity46 has been famous for her enviable wardrobe			1
earlier this year - before announcing that she was pregnant with her first child - she and husband @entity277 attended the @entity49 , both in head - to - toe @entity48			2
@entity46 topped off her classic @entity276 siren look with gently waved hair and a red lipstick			0
@entity290 and @entity291 made fashion missteps in big - skirted gowns at red carpet events this year @entity106 : big skirts and big hair @entity290 might have looked a vision of pink , salmon and red in @entity301 at the @entity302 in february but the pink spiky hairpiece tucked into her updo took her outfit from beautiful to bizarre			1
similarly @entity291 's monochrome gown , designed by the @entity307 , and featuring his signature on the voluminous white skirts , swamped her tiny frame			0
and her voluminous up - do just made the @entity313 star look top heavy			0
but with awards season just round the corner , fashion fans will soon see what style hits and misses 2015 has in store .			0

see - through dresses , layered tulle and glamour were big @entity325 trends
stars like @entity69 and @entity173 rocked red carpet chic
@entity4 's @entity108 chain dress was the year 's greatest fashion faux pas
