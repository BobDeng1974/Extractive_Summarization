by @entity0 for @entity1 most children can not hide their excitement when they hear that they are going to have a new little brother or sister			0
but not this boy , whose first reaction to his mother 's big news is to ask : ' what were you thinking ? ' the @entity14 toddler , called @entity15 by his mom , then spends the next minute - and - a - half explaining why his mother is wrong to ' replace ' him with another baby			1
when his mom gives him the news , he puts his head in his hands and says : ' what were you thinking ? why you have to go and get another baby ? you just had two			2
' this is exasperating , because you just got two			0
' so why do you wan na get another baby and just replace one of your babies ? it 's too much			0
' @entity15 's mother tries to explain that she would never replace him or his sister , @entity46 , who is sat next to him quietly observing the argument			1
' it makes no sense ' : @entity15 , who already has one younger sibling , just can not get his head round the fact his mother is going to have another child she says : ' you 're just gon na have another brother or sister that you have to help take care of			2
' but her son replies adorably , holding his hands up and saying : ' but that does n't make no sense			2
' because if it made sense then you 'd just have two babies and you keep loving them forever and not having another baby between us			0
' after asking his mother whether the baby will be a boy or a girl , disgruntled @entity15 tells her that a boy crying will be ' even worse ' than his sister 's			1
he explains that he heard a baby boy crying at school , holding his hands to his ears as he recounts the clearly painful memory			0
a boy will be ' even worse ' : @entity15 dismisses his mom 's comments when he asks her what sex his new sibling will be			1
apparently having a little brother would be even more of a problem than a sister tiring of the conversation , his pregnant mother says : ' well @entity15 , i do n't know what to tell you about the crying , you just got ta get used to it , ok ? ' he cheekily replies : ' ok , and buy me some earplugs too			1
