a mother - of - two has detailed her transition away from the typical ' tiger mom ' parenting she used to employ in favor of a more relaxed and nurturing approach			1
@entity6 , 47 , a journalist based in @entity7 , admits she academically over-stretched her daughter @entity8 , now 12 , to the point where she became anxious , self - critical , and was actually under - performing			1
' the stressed and anxious kids of today are the depressed adults of tomorrow , ' she tells @entity11			2
' @entity13 parenting wrecks family life and it ruins our enjoyment of parenting			2
at the time , according to a piece written by @entity31 for the @entity32 , ms @entity6 was ' devastated ' over the rejection			1
now she ' shudders ' when she remembers how much she let it get to her , and how inadequate she felt as a mother			1
the next few years in @entity25 were a flurry of prestigious schools , expensive private tutors and jam - packed after - school activities schedules			1
phew : ' now there is no longer tension and expectation , @entity8 has got rid of those negative voices , ' says ms @entity6 , pictured with her daughter @entity45 , nine , ( left ) , husband @entity47 ( center right ) and @entity8 ( right ) smiles : ' @entity13 parenting backfires ultimately because while we think we are " improving " our children , in fact , over-stretched , anxious kids do n’t learn , ' ms @entity6 says , pictured with @entity55 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) ms @entity6 , a working mom , claims she once supplied her nanny with a 20 - page instructions manual to keep @entity8 and her other daughter @entity45 , now nine , on track			1
' i asked her to play @entity61 and @entity62 in the background while [ they were ] eating breakfast , ' she said			2
' they went to every toddler music , ballet and art class i could find			2
' it was n't until @entity8 was seven years old and in second grade at a private school back in @entity7 that ms @entity6 got her wake - up call			1
@entity8 had won a science prize , but rather than be happy , she fled the ceremony ' in tears			0
' ironically , it was an educational psychologist ms @entity6 had hired who advised her to relax the reins and to drop the intensive after - school learning centers @entity8 had been attending			1
' @entity13 parenting backfires ultimately because while we think we are " improving " our children , in fact , over-stretched , anxious kids do n’t learn , ' she tells us			0
' one of the most worrying things is that kids internalize critical voices in their own heads because they are constantly told they " must do better " in this hot - house educational environment			2
' ms @entity6 , who claims her own parents were n't strict with her at all , points to a specific area of @entity8 's education as having caused the young girl anxiety in the past : math. she had simply made her mind up that she was ' rubbish ' at it and was having serious trouble overcoming her mental block ; a time during which she had a private math tutor , and when ms @entity6 was in the habit of standing over her at homework time			1
' now there is no longer that tension and expectation around the subject , and she has got rid of those negative voices , she is actually excelling in that subject , ' ms @entity6 reports			1
' the other day she came home beaming because she scored 78per cent in her math test – something that was unheard of a few years ago - and that was completely down to her and nothing to do with me			2
' @entity13 queen : @entity120 , a 52 - year - old mom and @entity122 professor , prompted a widespread backlash after her memoir was released , with critics blasting her extreme parenting approach antithesis : ms @entity6 's book ( left ) deals with taming tiger parenting , whereas ms @entity120 's ( right ) champions strict rules and high expectations in regards to her daughters where once ms @entity6 's first questions when her kids got home from school every day centered around tests or performance , she now focuses on different aspects			1
' now i am more interested in hearing about what games they played and how they got along with their friends , ' she says			0
' and now when i am with my kids , it ’s not about constantly looking for " teachable moments			0
" it ’s just about being together			0
' even when ms @entity6 feels her perfectionist urges come on , she manages to turn her thinking round			1
' it ’s just not fair on kids to make them run a race they did n’t ask to compete in , ' she remarks			0
ms @entity6 's book , @entity162 , is at definite odds with a well - known book released by infamous tiger mom @entity120 in 2011 , @entity164			1
ms @entity120 , a 52 - year - old @entity122 professor and mom to two daughters , prompted a widespread backlash after the memoir was released , with critics blasting her extreme parenting approach			1
' i was raised by very strict @entity173 immigrant parents , ' ms @entity120 writes on her website			0
' as parents , they demanded total respect and were very tough with my three younger sisters and me			0
' we got in trouble for a minuses , had to drill math and piano every day , no sleepovers , no boyfriends			0
' but the strategy worked with me ...			0
that ’s why i tried to raise my own two daughters the same way my parents raised me			0
' ms @entity6 , who has read the book , is n't so sure			1
' i really admired @entity120 's honesty , ' she says			0
' but it was one of the things that got the ball rolling for me			0
' it showed how pushy parenting can alienate parents from their children , something that she experienced with her second daughter			0
' indeed , ms @entity120 writes of @entity203 : ' my younger daughter seemed to turn against everything i stood for and it felt like i was losing her and everything was falling apart			0
at 13 , she rebelled			0
' ms @entity120 may have been very open about her tiger parenting , but many moms have a habit of keeping their methods behind closed doors , suggests ms @entity6			1
' these parents - i call them ' swans ' - aim to ensure their children do better than everyone else ’s , ' she says			2
' but to make it look as if it ’s all by magic – and done without any pushing or tutoring - because their offspring are genetically blessed			2
' now that @entity8 , who is thriving , is left more to her own devices , she has developed a love for playing the violin			0
her sister @entity45 is doing well too			0
' i believe and hope that truly being themselves , rather than living up to my expectations , has made both my children happier and more resilient , ' ms @entity6 concludes			1
