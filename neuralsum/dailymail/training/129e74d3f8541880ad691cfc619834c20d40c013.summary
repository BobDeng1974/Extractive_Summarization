by @entity0 scientists from @entity2 found that the pill 's powerful hormones can temporarily ' age ' the reproductive system going on the pill could damage a woman ’s future fertility - at least temporarily , a new study has revealed			1
researchers found that the powerful hormones can ‘ age ’ the reproductive system , reducing the production of eggs to levels seen in older women , months after coming off the contraceptive			1
while scientists do not think the phenomenon is permanent , they advise that a woman ’s ‘ biological clock ’ should be measured three months after finishing taking the pill			1
the link emerged in a study of 833 women between the ages of 19 and 46 years old , who were attending a fertility clinic			0
experts measured anti-mullerian hormone ( @entity32 ) and antral follicles ( @entity34 ) which are indicators of ‘ ovarian reserve ’ or fertility			1
levels of @entity32 and @entity34 were 19 per cent and 16 per cent lower in pill users			0
in addition , between 19 per cent and 52 per cent less eggs were produced by the women taking part in the study , with the greatest reductions seen in those under 30			2
dr @entity47 , of @entity48 , said : ‘ we expected to find an effect of the pill			2
but during the project we were surprised at the quantified effect on ovarian reserve parameters as defined by @entity56 hormone , antral follicle count and ovarian volume			0
’ even after statistical adjustment for age , @entity59 , smoking and maternal age at menopause , @entity32 was still up to 30 per cent lower and @entity34 up to 20 per cent lower in pill users			1
dr @entity47 presented her results at a meeting of the @entity69 in @entity70 and said that they suggest measurements of @entity32 and @entity34 should be monitored in those taking the pill			0
experts have advised that a woman 's ' biological clock ' should be measured three months after coming off the contraceptive			1
most women are able to become pregnant six months after stopping the pill			2
file picture researchers have found that a woman 's sex drive is not affected if she meets her partner while she is already taking the pill			1
however , women do see their sex drive fall if they stop taking the pill during a relationship , according to a study released last month			0
researchers from four @entity94 universities and @entity95 in @entity96 studied 365 couples			0
they investigated how sexual aspects of long - term relationships were influenced by women 's use of hormonal contraception			0
lead researcher dr @entity103 from @entity105 's @entity104 said : ‘ our findings showed women who had met their partner while taking the pill and were still currently taking it - as well as those who had never used the pill at any point - reported greater sexual satisfaction than those women who had begun or stopped using the pill during the course of the relationship			1
‘ in other words , the congruence of women 's pill use throughout the relationship had a greater influence on sexual satisfaction levels than either simply being on the pill or not being on the pill			1
’ she said : ‘ we do not believe the pill changes the ovaries in any permanent way			2
' but we still need to know more about the recovery phase after women stop the pill			0
‘ the pill is unlikely to change the basal ovarian biology of egg depletion - but it certainly changes the appearance of the ovaries and the secretion of @entity32			0
’ dr @entity47 said women in the pre-conceptional care programme in @entity48 who have been on the pill ‘ are now advised their ovaries may look old with small volume , a few small antral follicles and low levels of @entity32 '			2
but she said this may not necessarily reflect their future fertility status			0
in order to have a more precise measurement of the biological clock ’s status and to reassure the pill user about her fertility potential , ovarian reserve assessment – the capacity of the ovary to provide egg cells that are capable of fertilisation - might be repeated three months after stopping the pill			1
she said that the pill could mask a severely diminished ovarian reserve and this is important to recognise			0
most women are able to become pregnant six months after stopping the pill .			2

scientists from @entity2 found the contraceptive pill 's powerful hormones can ‘ age ’ the reproductive system
findings showed ageing process temporarily *slowed* the production of eggs
the effect was most clearly seen in women under the age of 30
experts advise that a woman 's ' biological clock ' should be measured three months after coming off the contraceptive
