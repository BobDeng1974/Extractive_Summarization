by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 09:31 est , 30 september 2013 @entity2 's newest delivery service pulled up at the @entity3 on sunday after a week 's delay , bringing more than a half - ton of meals and special treats to the astronauts who assisted in the high - flying feat. with the smooth linkup , @entity9 became only the second company to accomplish such a far - flung shipment			1
the space station astronauts used their ship 's huge robot arm to grab the @entity17 capsule , as the two vessels zoomed 260 miles above the @entity19			1
the @entity23 2 which will grapple the spacecraft can be seen lower left			1
parking up : after a series of successful steering maneuvers , the @entity17 freighter parked about 39 feet from the station complex : ten minutes later , @entity32 astronaut @entity31 and @entity2 's @entity33 used the station 's robotic arm to pluck the capsule from orbit and prepared to attach it to a berthing slip ‘ everybody is just so excited , ’ @entity40 radioed			1
ground teams described the achievement as ‘ epic ’ and ‘ superb			2
’ ` @entity9 launched the @entity45 on this test flight from @entity47 on sept. 18			1
it was supposed to reach the space station last sunday , but got held up by inaccurate navigation data			2
a software patch fixed everything			2
then the @entity17 had to wait for a @entity53 spacecraft bringing three new astronauts in midweek			2
the successful arrival means the @entity47 - based company can begin making good on a $ 1.9 billion contract with @entity2 for a series of @entity17 deliveries			1
the next one could fly by @entity60			2
@entity61 could be heard in @entity40 once @entity32 astronaut @entity31 grabbed hold of @entity17 with the space station 's hulking mechanical arm			2
that 's a long time coming , ’ @entity40 radioed			0
‘ smiles all around , ’ added @entity9 in a tweet			1
delay : @entity17 ' arrival had been delayed a week - first by a software glitch and then by the higher priority docking of a @entity53 soyuz capsule ferrying three new crewmembers to the $ 100 billion outpost , a project of 15 nations dropping off food : the firm , known as @entity79 , holds a $ 1.5 billion @entity2 contract for 12 cargo runs to the station , two of which already have been completed sunday 's successful operation culminated years of effort for @entity9 , which was hired by @entity2 along with the @entity87 - based @entity79 to keep the space station well stocked in this post-shuttle era			1
@entity79 has been launching its supply ships , called @entity91 , for more than a year			1
it 's also working on a possible manned capsule that would ferry @entity94 astronauts to the space station , rather than having them hitch rides on @entity53 rockets			0
unlike the @entity91 that can return items to @entity99 , the @entity17 is designed to burn up upon descent			0
once unloaded of its 1,300 pounds worth of food , clothes and other items , it will be filled with trash and cut loose toward the end of october			0
that 's how the @entity53 , @entity108 and @entity109 supply ships end up as well : self - destructing garbage cans			0
the latest delivery included student experiments and , almost certainly , chocolate for the six - person crew			0
that 's what astronaut @entity33 was expecting , anyway , from her astronaut - husband and 3 - year - old son			0
following the early morning capture , the astronauts worked to install @entity17 - named after the swan constellation - on the space station			0
the hatch opening was set for early monday			0
both @entity31 and @entity40 paid tribute to the late astronaut for whom the @entity17 is dedicated : @entity126			0
@entity126 flew three times on space shuttles , then went to work for @entity9 to help in this new commercial space effort			1
he died of cancer in 2008 at age 52			0
his family attended the @entity17 launch from @entity2 's @entity134			0
‘ to our great friend and colleague @entity126 ... this one 's for you , ’ @entity9 said via @entity135 .			1
