by @entity1 reporter published : 11:55 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 03:34 est , 12 december 2012 playing a violent video game for just an hour over a three - day period is enough to increase aggressive behaviour , according to a new study			1
however , playing a non-violent video game , such as a racing game , has no effect on aggression when played for 20 minutes a day for three consecutive days			1
although previous studies have revealed a single violent gaming session can increase short - term aggression , this is the first to show longer - term effects			2
test : students were asked to play a violent video game such as @entity18 ( pictured ) or a non-violent title such as the racing game @entity20 lead author professor @entity22 , of @entity23 , @entity24 , compares the effect to smoking : ' it 's important to know the long - term causal effects of violent video games , because so many young people regularly play these games			1
' playing video games could be compared to smoking cigarettes			0
a single cigarette wo n't cause lung cancer , but smoking over weeks or months or years greatly increases the risk			0
' in the same way , repeated exposure to violent video games may have a cumulative effect on aggression			1
' a total of 70 @entity44 university students were told they would be taking part in a three - day study on the effects of brightness of video games on visual perception			2
they were then told to play either a violent or non-violent game for 20 minutes everyday for three consecutive days by the researchers from the @entity54 and the @entity55 , @entity56			1
the violent video games in the study for the @entity59 were condemned 2 , @entity18 and @entity60 , while those in the non-violent group played @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
after playing each game , the students were given the beginning of a story , and then asked to list 20 things the main character will do or say as the story unfolds to measure their hostile expectations			1
in one story , a driver crashes into the back of the protagonist 's car - causing significant damage - and the researchers counted how many times the students listed violent or aggressive actions and words that might occur			2
people who have a steady diet of playing these violent games may come to see the world as a hostile place , say scientists the students then participated in a competitive reaction time task , which is used to measure aggression , with each participant told they would compete against an unseen opponent in a computer game where the object was to be the first to respond to a visual cue on the screen			1
the loser received a blast of unpleasant noise through headphones - such as nails on a chalk board or sirens - and the winner decided how loud and long the blast would be			0
in reality , there was no opponent and the participants were told they won about half the trials			0
results showed that after each day , those who played the violent games had an increase in their hostile expectations - meaning they were more likely to think the characters would react with aggression or violence			1
prof @entity22 said : ' people who have a steady diet of playing these violent games may come to see the world as a hostile and violent place			2
' these results suggest there could be a cumulative effect			0
hostile expectations are probably not the only reason that players of violent games are more aggressive , but our study suggests it is certainly one important factor			2
' after playing a violent video game , we found that people expect others to behave aggressively			1
' that expectation may make them more defensive and more likely to respond with aggression themselves , as we saw in this study and in other studies we have conducted			0
' he said it is ' impossible ' to know how much aggression could increase for those who play video games for months or years , as most people do			0
' we would know more if we could test players for longer periods of time , but that is n't practical or ethical			0
' i would expect that the increase in aggression would accumulate for more than three days			0
it may eventually level off			0
' however , there is no theoretical reason to think that aggression would decrease over time , as long as players are still playing the violent games			0

@entity23 students were asked to play a violent video game or a driving game over three days
they were then set a couple of tests to see how they reacted to the outside world
those who played shoot - em - ups like @entity175 were more likely to *assume* the world was hostile and react aggressively
