by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 15 november 2013 three brothers who were torn apart when two were shipped to @entity3 as part of the child migrant scheme in seventies have been reunited in @entity7 - 43 years after the last time they were all together			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were separated as children after being taken into care following the death of their father			1
however as authorities decided the care for unwanted children had become too expensive , the boys , like thousands of others , were offered the chance of a ' better ' life abroad			1
@entity9 was just seven when the boys were taken into care by a foster family in the @entity7 while the eldest brother @entity9 opted to stay and work on a @entity7 pig farm instead , his younger siblings were shipped to work on farms in @entity3 where they endured ' mental and physical abuse '			1
the boys lost touch shortly after their departure , and went decades without a hint of each other 's whereabouts			0
but , with the help of the @entity44 , the family from @entity46 in @entity28 have been able to reunite in the @entity7			1
father - of - three @entity9 said : ' it was very emotional			2
' it was great for my kids and family to meet them			0
it 's still sinking in that we 're finally together as a three			0
' the boys lived together with a foster family before being asked if they 'd like to go to @entity3 , described to them in school as ' the land of opportunity ' @entity10 and @entity59 at their childhood home in @entity28 in the 1960s			1
the pair had n't seen each other for 21 years before last week @entity8 and @entity10 recall suffering mental and physical abuse during their time in @entity66 where thousands of children were sent to work as part of the scheme the boys boarded the last deportee plane to @entity3 from @entity7 in 1970 - three years after the child migrant programme was scrapped the boys were taken into care in when @entity9 was seven after their father , who had ' walked out ' on them and their mother , in @entity28			1
after living together in foster homes for seven years , they were offered the chance to go to @entity3 in a school assembly announcement			1
@entity9 chose to stay in the @entity7 while his younger siblings boarded the very last deportee plane in december 1970			1
the oldest of the brothers told @entity85 : ' i remember , later , i regretted not going			2
' ' as i got older every time i saw a book or a poster about @entity3 it reminded me i had lost my brothers			1
' we were told it was the land of opportunity			0
but , now , hearing what happened to them out there , i 'm glad i did n't go , ' he said			0
younger brothers @entity8 and @entity10 were sent to @entity66 where they worked on farms together for several years before being separated			1
when asked what kind of treatment they endured , their older brother simply said : ' @entity106 '			0
' there were hundreds of them out there , hundreds , ' @entity9 added			2
the boy 's mother , @entity110 , put them into care as she felt she could n't cope following their father 's death @entity8 , who was just 11 when sent overseas said : ' the whole experience ruined my life			1
we were treated like slaves			0
it was wrong and should never have happened			0
' the care home was brutal - if the grass was n't cut in a certain way you 'd be punished for it and he 'd throw things at you like a stone or a shovel until it was done right			0
' ' i believe that all our choices , by being in @entity3 , were taken away from us			2
' disillusioned with the country he 'd been sent to in the hope of a better life , @entity8 returned to the @entity7 in his 20s after selling all of his possessions to buy a ticket			1
his search for older brother @entity9 took a fortuitous turn one day while on he was on a train to @entity141			2
@entity9 , 57 , recalls how his younger brother ' met a rather innocuous woman ' who was able to track him down after the pair got chatting on the train			2
' i do n't know how she was able to find me , ' he said , ' but she did , ' adding the woman - who neither of them had ever met - happened to know where @entity9 worked at the time			2
they were reunited and began searching for youngest brother , @entity10 , though this proved a more difficult feat. ' it was just blockage after blockage after blockage - a series of dead ends , ' said @entity9			1
' it was n't that we did n't want to find him it was just so difficult back then , '			0
but in 2010 , following former prime minister @entity163 's apology to surviving migrant children , they were able to find their long - lost brother with the help of the @entity44			0
' @entity8 found them , ' @entity9 said , speaking of @entity10 and his family , who were living in @entity170 at the time			1
after their daughters began communicating on @entity174 , the men arranged @entity10 's overdue return to @entity28			1
speaking of their separate lives , @entity10 , a retired miner said : ' i have such fond memories of us as young boys and the jokes and laughter are still exactly the same			2
the origins of the scheme go back to 1618 when a hundred children were sent from @entity187 to @entity188 , @entity189 , with the final party of children arriving in @entity3 in 1970			1
it is estimated that over 130,000 children from the @entity7 were taken away from their struggling families and shipped to @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 ( formerly @entity198 ) and @entity3 as part of the programme which saw these vulnerable children as ' ideal immigrants '			1
in the post-war era , approximately 3,300 children were shipped to @entity3 while @entity196 , @entity198 and @entity195 received a combined total of about 1,000 children			1
it is thought the children , often as young as three , were separated from their siblings and told their parents were dead in order for them to make a fresh start abroad			1
they were sent away with the expectation of a better life in a foreign land , but the reality that awaited them was one of torment and abuse			0
most were enslaved to hard labour on farms in @entity3 and @entity195 , while in @entity196 children were placed with foster parents			1

after finding brother @entity8 , @entity9 tracked down their youngest sibling in @entity170 last year @entity8 and @entity10 pictured just four years before being sent to @entity66 in 1970			1
@entity8 was 11 while @entity10 was just nine when they left @entity7 in 2009 @entity3 prime minister @entity230 apologised to the surviving migrant children in @entity232 , expressing remorse for the ' absolute tragedy of childhoods lost '			1
speaking to an audience of around 900 , he said : ' we are sorry			0
' sorry that , as children , you were taken from your families and placed in institutions where so often you were abused			0
' sorry for the physical suffering , the emotional starvation and the cold absence of love , of tenderness , of care			2
' ' a turning point for shattered lives , a turning point for governments at all levels and of every political hue and colour to do all in our power to never allow this to happen again			0
' the following year prime minister @entity163 issued a separate apology for the ' misguided ' scheme			0
speaking in the @entity261 the former @entity260 said : ' to all those former child migrants and their families ... we are truly sorry			0
' we are sorry they were allowed to be sent away at the time when they were most vulnerable			0
we are sorry that instead of caring for them , this country turned its back			0
' and we are sorry that the voices of these children were not always heard , their cries for help not always heeded			0
' and we are sorry that it has taken so long for this important day to come and for the full and unconditional apology that is justly deserved			0
' mr @entity163 subsequently set up a Â£ 6million fund to help surviving families reunite			0
it was this fund that enabled the @entity10 brothers to come together after being separated for 43 years			1
' i never thought we would get the chance to be together as a three again			0
there 's no way we 're going to lose contact again - i 've missed them both so much			0
' the brothers plan to spend their time together visiting places from their childhood and introducing one another to family members speaking of the sequence of events that tore them apart , @entity10 said : ' we were too young to realise what was really going to happen			1
' when we arrived out there it was a extremely hard			0
' there was both physical and mental abuse at the home			1
they treated you just like a number - you never had any choices			0
' @entity308 and @entity8 had stayed in contact through letters but we eventually lost contact			2
' they sent me from place to place but over time @entity3 started to feel like home and i decided to stay			2
' during @entity10 's visit the brothers plan to introduce him to other family members and spend their time visiting places from their childhood			2
' we went back to our hometown where we spent most of our childhood			0
it was like walking back in time			0
' it was very special , ' said @entity8			2
though @entity10 is due to return to @entity3 next month , the men are certain not to lose touch again with - especially since their children have established communication with each other online			1
' it was very sad what happened to us back in the 70s , ' said @entity9			2
' but you know , now we 're back together it 's as though we were never apart			0
