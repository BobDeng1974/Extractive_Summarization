by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 19:55 est , 16 december 2013 @entity1 was accused of trying to avoid @entity3 justice yesterday after it claimed that @entity3 courts had no jurisdiction to put it on trial for privacy breaches			1
the search engine is accused of bypassing security settings on @entity10 , @entity11 and computers to track users ’ web browsing without their knowledge and send them targeted advertisements			1
a group of @entity3 internet users has launched legal action against the firm for breach of privacy			1
@entity1 appealed to the @entity24 to have the case thrown out claiming action should have been taken in @entity27 where its headquarters are			1
the company 's @entity30 office is pictured but yesterday @entity1 appealed to @entity32 ’s @entity24 to throw out the case , arguing that the @entity3 claimants should have launched their action in the @entity27 as that ’s where the firm is based			1
its headquarters are based in @entity40 , @entity41 , although it also has three offices in @entity32 and one in @entity45			1
the move , branded ‘ arrogant ’ by the claimants , will fuel anger over @entity1 ’s attempts to avoid regulation in overseas markets			2
the company already avoids hundreds of millions of pounds in corporation tax by legally booking @entity3 profits through its @entity56 headquarters in @entity57			2
@entity59 @entity58 , acting on behalf of @entity1 , told the court on the first day of a two - day hearing : ‘ it ’s not enough to say ‘ the claimants are here and they would like to sue here ’			2
‘ it ’s not a starting point where the claimants are , or where the claimants have their computers , or that they suffered their distress here			0
‘ the defendants are there ( in the @entity27 ) , its witnesses are there , its documents are there			2
’ but speaking outside the court , a spokesman for the claimants @entity78 , said : ‘ why should ordinary @entity3 people have to travel to @entity41 to seek justice ? ' @entity1 breached @entity3 people ’s privacy in @entity3			1
it has offices in the @entity3 , it employs staff in the @entity3 , and it makes a lot of money in the @entity3			1
the company already avoids hundreds of millions of pounds in corporation tax by legally booking @entity3 profits through its @entity56 headquarters in @entity57 ( pictured ) ‘ clearly , if it operates here and makes a profit here , it should answer to @entity97 law , but it wants to act in whichever way it wants , wherever it wants			2
‘ this is a point of principle for us because we believe you should abide by @entity97 law , no matter how big you are			0
' it should answer to @entity97 law , but it wants to act in whichever way it wants , wherever it wants			0
’ ‘ @entity1 has more than enough resources to fly its documents and its witnesses over here			2
’ the test claim is being brought by @entity3 internet users @entity121 , former editor of @entity123 magazine , @entity110 , director of an it security company , and @entity113 , director of an it services company – part of a group called @entity117 against @entity1 ’s @entity118			1
@entity125 ’s search browser @entity126 was designed to block software that allowed @entity1 to track what users were looking at online			1
but between summer 2011 and spring 2012 , @entity1 disabled this safeguard and monitored people ’s internet surfing habits without their knowledge			1
claimants allege the company bypassed security settings on @entity10 to track their web browsing habits @entity1 has already paid out a total of £ 24.2million to @entity27 states and the @entity142 for the same privacy breach			1
the claimants argue that @entity1 acted directly contrary to a 2009 amendment to a @entity146 which required consent before an internet user ’s device could be tracked for behavioural advertising			1
they say the company was able to collate a wealth of information on users , from their their shopping habits to more personal details about their physical and sexual health , political affiliations , union membership , financial situation and sexual interests			0
it then targeted them with advertisements based on the websites they had visited , causing them ‘ embarrassment and distress ’			0
mr @entity58 claimed the information obtained was ‘ not personal ’ , so @entity1 had no obligation to keep it confidential			2
but he appeared to admit that its targeted advertisements were irritating			0
he told the court : ‘ if you have a car parked on your driveway you might get a flier through for a local garage			0
‘ it ’s irritating , it ’s unwanted and it is unsolicited but does it cross that threshold , my submission is that it does n’t			0
‘ another example is in my inbox i get unsolicited emails every day			0
‘ there might technically be a @entity56 court action to stop that but you can not claim damages just because of that			0
’ he said he anticipated any damages awarded at the end of proceedings would be ‘ very modest ’ and said the nature of the allegations suggested any breach of privacy had been ‘ a nuisance ’ , rather than serious			0
but the claimants ’ barrister mr @entity201 dismissed the comparison to junk mail , saying : ‘ we say there are very serious and important issues which relate to how @entity1 , a corporation of immense wealth and power , deals with private information and the individuals who use their services			0
‘ we wholly reject the idea these are trivial and uninteresting claims sounding in trivial sums and the court should not entertain them			0
’ the claimants ’ solicitor @entity217 , said : ‘ @entity1 has a history of making it difficult for people to take legal action against them			1
‘ they may be hoping the claimants will drop the case if is heard in @entity27			1
the proceedings were heard before mr @entity227 at @entity228 ( pictured ) ‘ or they may be hoping they will be treated more favourably in @entity27 , even if they were tried under @entity97 law			0
’ @entity1 pointed to a similar @entity27 case launched by members of the public			1
it was shut down in october when a judge said users had not come to any harm even if they were tracked			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we ’re asking the court to re-examine whether this case meets the standards required in the @entity3 for a case like this to go to trial			2
’ the proceedings were heard before mr @entity227 , sitting in the @entity249 ’s @entity248			0
the hearing concludes today .			0
