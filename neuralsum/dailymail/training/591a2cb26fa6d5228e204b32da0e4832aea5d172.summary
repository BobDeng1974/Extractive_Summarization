shhh : @entity2 axed mr @entity1 in november after he accrued 12 points on his licence for speeding offences and magistrates banned him from driving ‘ it was n't really farmed before and it is now , so that 's been an outlay , which will take a while to get back			1
’ ' i was very surprised by their reaction			2
it was neurotic and very heavy - handed			1
they never said thanks ' @entity1 he said that he had been lambing for two years , adding : ‘ it 's a real effort to get up at 2am and go out into the cold and wet to check them , but once you get there , it 's sort of a maternity ward			2
‘ i do quite like the ewes , especially when they 're pregnant , and when you get that first bleat from the newborn lamb , it 's pretty good			2
’ mr @entity1 admitted that working on the farm was a learning curve and that he had made some mistakes			0
he said : ‘ there was one occasion when the ( newborn ) lamb was already dead , and i went back in and pulled another one out that was perfectly healthy			0
magazine : the interview with @entity1 can be read in the latest issue of the @entity27 , on sale today ‘ i left the mother that night , but when i went back she was obviously poorly , and then she died , probably because there was another lamb inside that had died			0
