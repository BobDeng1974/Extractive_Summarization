by @entity0 it has only just been announced that scientists are working on printing a heart using a patient ’s own cells and now a 3d model of a cancerous tumour has been created using a 3d printer			1
the model , which consists of a scaffold of fibrous proteins coated in cervical cancer cells , provides a realistic @entity14 representation of a tumour ’s environment			1
it is hoped that it could help in the discovery of new drugs and cast new light on how tumours develop , grow and spread throughout the body			1
realistic : a 3d model of a cancerous tumour has been created using a 3d printer			1
the model , which consists of a scaffold of fibrous proteins coated in cervical cancer cells , has provided a realistic @entity14 representation of a tumour 's environment			1
@entity14 printed hela cells in tumour - like configurations are pictured 3d printing is already being used in medicine			2
researchers have used the technology to make splints , valves and even a human ear			0
so far , the @entity41 in @entity42 has printed human heart valves and small veins with cells			0
the team has also successfully tested the tiny blood vessels in mice and other small animals			0
professor @entity50 , of the @entity51 , believes scientists will be able to print parts and assemble an entire heart in three to five years			0
the 3d printer uses a mixture of a gel and living cells to gradually build the shape of a blood vessel – and one day a heart			2
the idea is that eventually , the cells would grow together to form the tissue			0
in the future it could take just three hours to print the whole structure of the heart			0
a group of researchers in @entity71 and the @entity72 created a model of a grid structure that measures 1cm squared and is made from gelatine , alginate and fibrin to recreate the fibrous proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of a tumour			1
the grid structure is coated in hela cells - a unique , ‘ immortal ’ cell line that was originally derived from a cervical cancer patient in 1951			1
due to the cells ’ ability to divide indefinitely in laboratory conditions , the cell line has been used in some of the most significant scientific breakthrough studies of the past 50 years			0
although the most effective way of studying tumours is to do so in a clinical trial , ethical and safety limitations make it difficult for these types of studies to be carried out on a wide scale			0
to overcome this , 2d models , consisting of a single layer of cells are created to mimic the physiological environment of tumours so that different types of drugs can be tested in a realistic way			1
grid with great potential : a group of researchers created a model of a grid structure that measures 1cm squared and is made from gelatin , alginate and fibrin ( pictured ) to recreate the fibrous proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of a tumour			2
the grid structure is coated in hela cells - a unique , ' immortal ' cell line but now scientists can make a more realistic representation of the environment surrounding a tumour using 3d printing			1
in the study , the researchers proved that the cells were alive after printing and examined how they proliferated as well as looking at their resistance to anti-cancer drugs			0
the proteins studied were part of the @entity134 protein family , which are used by cancer cells to break through their surrounding matrix and help tumours to spread			1
resistance to anti-cancer drugs , which was also studied , is a good indicator of tumour malignancy			0
the results , which were published in the @entity145 ’s journal @entity146 , revealed that 90 per cent of the cancer cells remained viable after the printing process			2
learning by heart : earlier this week scientists announced they hope to create a new heart for a patient using a 3d printer and their own cells			2
the organ could be created in just three to five years time and be transplanted in a human within the next decade			0
the printing of ' ventricle cylinders ' is pictured the results also showed that the 3d model had more similar characteristics to a tumour compared to @entity164 models and in the 3d model the cancer cells showed a higher proliferation rate ( the time between cell divisions ) and higher resistance to anti-cancer drugs			1
the lead author of the research , professor @entity171 , from @entity172 , @entity71 and @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity72 said : ‘ we have provided a scalable and versatile 3d cancer model that shows a greater resemblance to natural cancer than 2d cultured cancer cells			1
‘ with further understanding of these 3d models , we can use them to study the development , invasion , metastasis and treatment of cancer using specific cancer cells from patients			2
‘ we can also use these models to test the efficacy and safety of new cancer treatment therapies and new cancer drugs			0

researchers from @entity172 , @entity71 , and @entity173 , @entity72 created a scaffold of proteins coated in cervical cancer cells
their 3d model of a cancerous tumour , created using a 3d printer , has provided a realistic @entity14 representation of a tumour ’s environment
it is hoped that it could help in the discovery of new drugs and cast new light on how tumours develop , grow and spread throughout the body
