by @entity0 a dog deliberately scalded and left for dead in a canal has now been trained to sit in the shade and uses his own special sun cream to protect his damaged skin			1
in a horrific case of animal cruelty four months ago , @entity6 , a @entity8 bull terrier , was scalded , left in ‘ burning agony ’ and dumped in a canal in @entity13 , @entity14			1
his skin and fur were completely burnt off his neck and back in the attack which rescuers believe could have been done with hot water or oil			1
but the seven - year - old ’s life has been turned around , thanks to animal charity @entity24 and a caring new owner			1
@entity8 bull terrier @entity6 , pictured with wounds from the cruel burning he received still clearly visible a much happier @entity6 pictured at his new home in @entity31 , where he wears sunscreen and a special vest to protect his scarring before he heads out in the sun. he is also trained to sit in the shade when possible he now spends his days raiding kitchen bins , scoffing blackberries , and larking around in @entity31 with new owner @entity39			1
the former nurse , 55 , was touched by @entity6 ’s plight after seeing an appeal to help pay for his vets ’ fees in a dog magazine			2
she said : ' i was horrified , this kind of thing seems to be happening all the time			2
@entity6 was on my mind all the time , and i could n’t get him off it , so in the end i said i would take him			0
' i ’ve always had @entity8 bull terriers so i know the breed really well , and as i am also an ex-nurse i was able to give him continuing care			1
' in the first couple of days he was a bit stressed , especially at night , but i bought him a @entity58 which is like a big hug and then there was no problem			1
' @entity6 was picked up from @entity24 in june after staff there helped him to recover			0
he now has a new playmate in fellow @entity8 bull terrier @entity65 and has been trained to sit in the shade to keep the sun off his scar where he was scalded			1
every day he has @entity71 honey and suncream rubbed into the wound and on especially hot days he also wears a vest for extra protection from the sun. @entity6 , left , pictured hanging out with his new friend and fellow @entity8 bull terrier @entity65 left , an injured @entity6 with @entity24 team member @entity79 , who helped treat him after he was abused and on the right with his new owner @entity39 and her other @entity8 bull terrier called @entity65 but he has yet to experience the sea , as dogs are not allowed on local beaches between may and september			1
his new owner added : ' @entity6 has fitted in perfectly – he has n’t got a bad bone in his body and is a real softy			0
he ’s definitely got a mischievous streak in him though and is a really fun dog			0
' he raids bins and basically emptied the kitchen one , so now i put everything outside			0
but that ’s the only bad thing i have come across in him			0
' @entity6 also loves blackberries			0
i have some at the bottom of my garden and he goes down every day			0
the other day i thought , " @entity103 , what ’s happened to his scar ? " , but it was just covered in blackberry juice			2
' @entity106 , who runs the @entity24 centre in @entity108 and @entity13 , said she had never before seen a case of animal cruelty as bad as @entity6 's			2
' @entity6 was in absolute burning agony because the burns were so severe , i do n’t know whether they were third degree burns , but they had taken all the layer of skin off			2
' it is n’t just this one dog , we are rammed full of neglect and cruelty cases			0
' @entity14 is a cruelty hotspot and rescue centres are collapsing all the time			1
there is no other place this dog could have been taken to but us - he would have ended up in kennels			0
