the only previous record of a wild @entity6 in @entity2 was in 1953 , when it was seen just once in @entity8 , @entity9			1
in the past week there have already been four confirmed sightings , along the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity9 , and six further reports of the butterfly in coastal areas stretching as far north as @entity18			2

‘ so to have up to ten sightings in a week is incredibly exciting			2
’ the butterflies are thought to have flown on easterly winds across @entity4 in the last few weeks			1
mr @entity29 said : ‘ we were tipped off by colleagues in @entity42 that they had seen about 40 of these butterflies , the first time they had ever been seen in their country before			0
‘ when they reached the @entity42 coast they told us to keep an eye out for them coming over			0
’ the large and colourful insect has a territory stretching from from @entity4 to @entity55			1
in recent years it has spread into @entity57 and thrives during warm weather			0
also known as the @entity6 , it has an orange and blue colour , measuring just over two inches ( 6cm ) from wing - tip to wing - tip , and is about one third bigger than our own @entity64			1
sir @entity66 , president of the @entity31 , is this week promoting the @entity67 @entity31 is this weekend launching its annual @entity67 , a yearly survey of the butterflies across the nation			0

sir @entity66 , president of the charity , said : ‘ the @entity2 is a nation of amateur naturalists and we have a proud tradition of celebrating and studying our wildlife			1

‘ the spectacle of @entity90 and @entity91 flitting around buddleia bushes is one of the classic sights of @entity2 summertime			1
‘ @entity96 fought back last year after a terrible 2012 but despite this , butterfly numbers were still below average			0
three - quarters of the @entity2 ’s butterflies are in decline and one - third are in danger of extinction			2
‘ this is bad news for butterflies and it is bad news for the @entity2 ’s birds , bees , bats and other wildlife			2
this is because butterflies are a key indicator species of the health of our environment – if they are struggling , then many other species are struggling also			0
