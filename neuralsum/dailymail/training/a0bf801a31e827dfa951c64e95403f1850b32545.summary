@entity0 has hailed the goal knack of defender @entity2 and claims it is down to ' desire ' and ' strength ' not good fortune			1
@entity2 scored @entity8 's goal in a 1 - 1 draw in the @entity10 away to @entity11 to enhance his reputation for scoring crucial goals at key moments in big matches			1
' he has scored some important goals for us , ' said captain @entity0			1
' look at the @entity18 one a couple of weeks ago			0
he pops up in the final of the @entity20			0
he really is a top player for the team			0
it 's a desire and hunger he 's got and the aggression and strength he 's got to want to firstly get in those positions and secondly out - strength the opponent and be a lot hungrier			1
' @entity2 slides on his knees after scoring the opening goal of the last 16 @entity10 clash @entity2 rises above @entity11 's defence to give his side the lead in the 36th minute @entity2 wheels away in celebration after scoring a precious away goal for @entity39 's side @entity0 claims it is no fluke that @entity2 pops up to score important goals in big games for @entity43 @entity2 scored an extra-time winner against @entity18 in the @entity46 semi-final last month and his header to beat @entity48 and win the @entity20 final in 2013 has it 's place in @entity8 history			1
in @entity52 , the goal was the work of three quarters of @entity8 's back - four with @entity55 flicking @entity0 's low cross into the air for @entity2 to finish			1
' yeah , it was all about the low cross , ' joked @entity0			1
' i said to @entity61 i 'd seen him			0
no , i just managed to whip it in			0
i do n't know why or what i was doing there but it was a great flick from @entity66 and more importantly a great header from @entity68			0
' @entity11 goalkeeper @entity69 was unable to stop @entity2 's header from hitting the back of the net @entity74 international @entity2 wheels away in celebration after scoring his fifth goal of the season @entity78 equalised but @entity8 hung on , with a little luck and some fabulous saves by goalkeeper @entity81 , who was recalled in favour if @entity83			1
' it 's unlucky for @entity85 , ' said @entity0			1
' he made two unbelievable saves from @entity87 against @entity88 last week , but he has been unbelievably professional around the club this season			0
i 've seen a lot of players in my time throw their toys out of the pram			0
' he 's been different class for the team , and that 's been important			1
the manager stresses the importance of the team coming first			0
they 're both there for the whole squad			0
both of them have been excellent			0
@entity11 forward @entity78 ( right ) celebrates after cancelling out @entity2 's first - half opener @entity78 looks to the sky after scoring past @entity8 goalkeeper @entity81 in the 54th minute ' we 've got the two best goalkeepers in the world in my opinion both fighting for one place			1
you ca n't keep them both happy			0
the manager manages to do it , i do n't know how			0
obviously they both want to play all the time			0
but the two of them are at the top of their games			0
rotating them is a tough job			0
i 'd rather that was the manager 's decision			2
' @entity39 faces the tricky decision of which goalkeeper to select in the @entity46 final against @entity134 at @entity135 on sunday week			1
' @entity85 's played most of the games ( in the @entity46 ) and @entity81 played the last round			1
but the manager 's always stressed the team comes first			2
that 's the most important thing			1
' @entity81 was recalled to the @entity8 line - up for @entity11 clash and made a number of important stops @entity83 had to make do with a place on the bench for the first leg of the last - 16 @entity10 clash @entity83 's contract expires next year and there will be a clamour for his signature at the end of the season			1
@entity0 said : ' we 've not even spoken and credit to @entity85 , he 's not rumbled the dressing room or sent shockwaves through the dressing room			1
he 's been really professional			2
' he knows he 's been a top keeper and still is a keeper with a lot to give			2
he 's fighting for his place			2
he has n't just given up and said " it 's your @entity81 "			2
when he 's come in he 's had to be brilliant and given the manager food for thought			2
' he could play for anyone			0
he 's been different class for us			2
he 's worth 10 - 12 points every season			2
