by @entity0 every day , more than 40 tonnes of meteoroids hit our atmosphere			1
many are tiny specks of comet dust that crumble harmlessly in @entity8 's atmosphere , producing a slow drizzle of meteors in the night sky			2
bigger chunks of asteroid and comet debris create dozens of nightly fireballs around the planet – and now , these real - time maps mean you ’ll never have to miss one again			1
scroll down for interactive map the blue map follows their position in the sky using the @entity25 @entity24 ( @entity26 )			1
the main showers are highlighted with circles and listed by their @entity30 name			1
a second radar map on the bottom looks at meteoroid speed an asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system			1
most are located between @entity39 and @entity40 in the @entity41			0
a comet is a rock covered in ice , methane and other compounds			2
their orbits take them much further out of the solar system			0
a meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up			2
this debris itself is known as a meteoroid			1
most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere			0
if any of this meteoroid makes it to @entity8 , it is called a meteorite			2
@entity66 , meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets			2
@entity72 ’s meteoroid visualisations are produced using the space agency ’s @entity74 software program which tracks an estimated 4,000 - 5,000 meteoroids a day			1
the blue map follows their position in the sky using the @entity25 @entity24 ( @entity26 )			1
the main showers are highlighted with circles and listed by their @entity30 name			1
a second radar map looks at meteoroid speed			1
the red regions indicate a speed of 7.5 miles / s ( 12km/s ) , the green from 26 miles / s ( 42km/s ) and the blue from 41 miles / s ( 66km/s )			1
the top left hand corner of the map shows the date and time of the data , which @entity72 claims to be near real - time			1
the data is constructed using a network of 12 cameras , six of which are placed in north @entity97 , north @entity98 , southern @entity99 , and southern @entity100			0
a further four are in the northern @entity103 / @entity102 area , and the remaining two are located in southern @entity105			0
the cameras have overlapping fields of view , which means that the same fireball can be detected by more than one camera			0
this allows @entity72 to calculate the height of the fireball and how fast it is going			0
they can also work out the orbit of the meteoroid responsible for creating the fireball , which gives clues about whether it came from a comet or an asteroid			1
if a camera captures an image of a fireball , it is uploaded to the @entity74 site , with images dating back to three weeks			1
the data is constructed using a network of 12 cameras , six of which are placed in north @entity97 , north @entity98 , southern @entity99 , and southern @entity100			0
pictured here are two images taken from the camera network in the past three weeks			0
the bottom left on both images shows a streak of light which could be a meteor as it burns up in @entity8 atmosphere pictured are pectacular meteors during a @entity140 meteor shower over @entity141 in @entity142			0
a meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up			2
this debris itself is known as a meteoroid			1
most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere if the fireball is travelling slow enough , and makes it low enough , it is possible that it can survive to the ground as a meteorite			0
earlier this month , an incredible animation for @entity161 was unveiled that lets you scroll and zoom around the world as meteorite impacts from recorded history unfold before your eyes			0
the map was created by data journalist @entity170 , and shows where asteroids have impacted over the last thousand years			2
scrolling around the world , you can see where some of the biggest hotspots are			0
and it also highlights how vulnerable our planet is to asteroids			2
@entity72 estimates that just 1 per cent of the millions of asteroids in our solar system have been found			0
but , although you can see recorded impacts on land in these animations , most asteroids that encounter @entity8 either explode in the atmosphere or land at sea			0
this means the vast majority are unrecorded and , as we do n't know the location of every asteroid in the solar system , we 're not sure when one will next hit .			0

maps produced using the space agency ’s @entity74 program which tracks an estimated 4,000 - 5,000 meteoroids a day
every day , more than 40 tonnes of meteoroids hit our planet , with larger chunks of comet debris becoming fireballs
the blue map tracks their position in the skies over our planet with the main showers highlighted in white circles
a second radar map looks at meteoroid speed . the red regions indicate a speed of 7.5 miles / s ( 12km/s ) , the green from 26 miles / s ( 42km/s ) and the blue from 41 miles / s ( 66km/s )
