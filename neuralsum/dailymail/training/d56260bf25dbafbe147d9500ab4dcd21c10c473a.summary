by @entity0 for @entity1 a school superintendent has come under fire for reportedly telling her students they were dressed like ' skanks ' before making them bend over so she could check the length of their skirts			1

under fire : @entity10 , pictured , reportedly upset students after she called them out for wearing inappropriate clothing to school			1
students claim she called them ' skanks with their a * * es hanging out ' ' the first question i asked was , " how many of you in here believe that there are female students on the campus today that are dressed completely inappropriate ? " most of their hands went up			1
' but students said that is not the language she used			0
student @entity51 told @entity52 the teacher actually said : ' have any of you guys seen anybody around here dressed like a skank ? if you can feel your skin on the bleachers then you ’re showing your a * *			2
and i do n’t want to see anybody 's a * * hanging out of their shorts			1

inappropriate ? one student , @entity64 , left , said she was singled out for this outfit , right , while some of her classmates were told to bend over so @entity10 could check that the length of their shorts humiliated : students , including @entity51 , said they did not believe the situation was handled well @entity10 , who calls herself @entity83 of the district , denied calling the girls ' skanks ' but said she was strict about the clothing because she had heard her students were being ridiculed by other schools			1
