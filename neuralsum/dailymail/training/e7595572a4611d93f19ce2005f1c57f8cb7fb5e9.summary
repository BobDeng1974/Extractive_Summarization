parents face an anxious wait to see if their child has got a primary school place because one in five schools are already over capacity , @entity0 warned today			1
@entity9 education secretary @entity8 said many families will be left disappointed , with pupils forced to travel further or squeeze into over-crowded classrooms			1
today is the deadline for applications for 380,000 children to start in september , with ministers admitting some will be offered places in schools parents can not have confidence in			1
official figures show that by 2023 there will be a total of 4.7million primary age pupils , up from 4.3million in 2014 parents have until midnight tonight to apply , naming at least three schools where they want to send their child			1
figures collected by the @entity0 suggest almost one in five primary schools does not have enough space for all its pupils			1
out of 130 councils who replied to a @entity35 request , 18 per cent admitted they did not have enough capacity for their pupils			1
it means children forced to learn in makeshift classrooms , including one primary school in @entity44 holding lessons in a converted double - decker bus			1
more than three - quarters of councils in @entity49 said they would need more primary school places in the next three years			1
writing for @entity51 , mr @entity8 said : ' as a parent there a few more anxious or exciting times			1
getting your child into a good local school can feel no less a prize than securing their place in an increasingly uncertain world			2
education secretary @entity61 insists the government has put funding in place for sufficient school places for whilst there is no doubt the digital economy of the future offers tremendous opportunities , for our children to thrive in this brave new world they need the best start in life			1
' but he warned : ' there is one anxiety parents of the 380,000 children applying for places this year need not face			1
' because this year 's primary school admissions process is complicated by a crippling shortage in places that will leave many parents disappointed			1
' mr @entity8 added : ' a squeeze on places does n't just mean bigger class sizes			1
it also means less choice for parents and longer school commutes , placing extra pressure on family life and relationships			1
' this week the @entity95 warned schools could be pushed to breaking over the next decade , with almost a million more places for pupils needed			1
the continuing squeeze on places could lead to a ' tipping point ' where there is no money or space left to expand schools any further , the @entity95 claimed			2
but the @entity106 have hit back at mr @entity8			1
a @entity108 spokesman said : ' i do n’t know what ’s worse , the scaremongering or the hypocrisy			0
@entity0 slashed the funding for school places and took 200,000 primary school places out of the system			1
' they did this in the middle of a baby boom and at the same time as letting immigration get out of control			0
' they wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money on their failed school building programme			2
and they presided over a drop in school standards so that under @entity0 one in three pupils left primary school unable to read , write and add up properly			1
' official figures predict that there may be around 900,000 extra pupils in @entity49 's schools over the next decade			1
the @entity95 said its own analysis had concluded that it will cost £ 12 billion to create enough school places for all of these children			1
the government has pledged £ 7.35 billion so far to create more places , but the @entity95 argued that this still leaves a major shortfall			0
education secretary @entity61 insisted money was being made available			0
she told @entity142 : '' we work very closely as a department with local authorities because obviously the provision of school places is absolutely right			2
' it has to be the provision , obviously , of good quality school places and that 's obviously why we 've also had the new free schools , which is schools being set up by parents and others and 70 per cent of them being set up in areas where there is a need for more places			1
' she added : ' there may be places available but they may not be the places that families actually want – the school may not be good enough for parents to have confidence in			2
' that 's part , again , of what we 've done over the last four and a half years – the standards are good enough , the quality of teaching is improved so parents have confidence so there are good schools right across the system			2
' @entity9 education secretary @entity8 said many families will be left disappointed , with pupils forced to travel further or squeeze into over-crowded classrooms forms filled ; criteria analysed ; open days attended ; @entity186 reports scrutinised ; head - teachers telephoned - now the waiting begins			1
because as the clock strikes midnight tonight , the deadline passes for next year 's primary school applications			1
as a parent there a few more anxious or exciting times			0
getting your child into a good local school can feel no less a prize than securing their place in an increasingly uncertain world			2
for whilst there is no doubt the digital economy of the future offers tremendous opportunities , for our children to thrive in this brave new world they need the best start in life			2
and evidence repeatedly shows that the first few years of education are absolutely crucial to life - long success ; how instilling a love of learning at an early age is the most effective way of ensuring our children fulfil their potential			0
we may well have become too obsessed with measuring the value of a great education in pounds and pence over the last few years			0
but there is no escaping the priceless nature of good schooling			0
however , there is one anxiety parents of the 380,000 children applying for places this year need not face			1
because this year 's primary school admissions process is complicated by a crippling shortage in places that will leave many parents disappointed			2
statistics show that nearly one in five primary school across the country does not have enough capacity for all its pupils			1
meanwhile , the number of infants in classes bigger than thirty pupils has soared by a staggering 200 per cent under the current government			1
libraries , music halls , office blocks , converted buses - children are being squeezed into any space that can hold them			0
there are now five times as many children educated in ' titan ' primary schools of more than 800 pupils			1
this despite a promise @entity257 made to parents back in 2010 to deliver ' smaller schools and smaller class sizes '			0
clearly , overflowing classrooms , with children receiving less individual attention from their teachers , represents a serious threat to the high standards and excellence all children deserve as they begin their education			0
when teachers become overstretched or overworked then their performance inevitably suffers			0
forty per cent of new teacher trainees leave the job within the first five years and far too many experienced teachers leave the profession altogether			0
not only does this damage achievement and undermine discipline , it also creates enormous inefficiencies in our teacher training system			0
what is worse : it gets in the way of passing on a love of learning			0
but often it is the more hidden aspects of this squeeze which are the most pernicious			0
playground prefab classrooms are not just a terrible environment in which to inspire young children with a thirst for knowledge and enquiry			0
they also mean less space for the sport and play which nurtures character and helps develop healthy lifestyles			0
similarly , a squeeze on places does n't just mean bigger class sizes			0
it also means less choice for parents and longer school commutes , placing extra pressure on family life and relationships			2
education secretary @entity61 might be relaxed about this because it only affects - in her words - a ' very , very small ' number of pupils			0
never mind that the number of infants in classes bigger than 30 is actually close to 100,000 , this attitude denies the broader impact upon parents lives			2
ignoring , alongside great teaching in a good local school , one of the biggest factors upon children 's achievement in the process			2
yet the truth is this primary school places crisis was entirely avoidable			2
the government has spent its time in office diverting precious resources away from areas in desperate need of places , ploughing them into expensive @entity341 pet projects in areas where there are no shortages			0
whatever anybody else feels about @entity346 , such largesse , in a time of severe public finance pressures and rising demand for places , is extraordinary			0
@entity0 will end the @entity341 programme and prioritise spending on providing good school places in areas that need them most			1
' my school taught me to work , to read and to think			0
it gave me great friendships			0
it filled me entirely and utterly for nearly the space of seven years			0
outside the cottage , i had nothing but my school ; but having my school , i had everything			0
' all parents would want their children to feel like sir @entity369 , a twentieth century principal of @entity370 , felt about his schooling			0
but when they open that precious @entity374 envelope on april 16th many are sure to be disappointed			0
they should know that the crippling shortage in primary school places is a direct result of @entity257 's incompetence and broken promises .			2

@entity0 warns 1 in 5 primary schools is over capacity already
