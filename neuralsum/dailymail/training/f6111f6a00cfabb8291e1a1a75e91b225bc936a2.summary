by @entity0 any baby that survives a premature birth is considered by their parents to be a miracle			2
but for @entity8 and @entity9 , their daughter is extra special			0
for little @entity10 is one of the smallest premature babies ever to survive in the @entity13 - and it 's all thanks to a pair of scissors			2
born at just 23 weeks , doctors were unsure whether she would survive , or whether they should try and save her			1
had it not been for a pair of scissors on the scales - bumping up her weight - doctors would not have fought to save the life of premature @entity26 , with parents @entity8 and @entity9 current ethical guidelines in the @entity13 on the care of very premature infants do not suggest providing active care for babies born at 22 weeks six days and earlier			1
but when they put her on the scales she weighed 1lb , the minimum weight for a baby to be considered viable , so they fought to keep her alive			1
it was only when she was safely on a ventilator that doctors discovered a pair of scissors had been accidentally left on the scales and that @entity10 actually only weighed 382g			1
born at just 23 weeks , doctors were unsure whether @entity10 would survive , or whether they should try and save her now six months old , she has been discharged from the @entity47 and is expected to grow into a healthy child			1
very premature babies born around 24 weeks go to neonatal intensive care units , although their parents often opt for withdrawal of care at some point when the medical outlook for the child worsens			0
babies born before this time struggle because their lungs and other vital organs are not developed enough			0
it was only when she was safely on a ventilator that doctors discovered @entity10 had actually only weighed 382g			1
guidelines state a baby must be 1lb to be considered viable @entity10 's mother @entity8 , 31 , of @entity67 , @entity68 , told @entity69 : ' we never thought we ’d ever bring @entity10 home			1
' she now weighs 5½lbs and is getting stronger by the day			0
she ’s our little miracle and we ’re so glad to have her home in time for @entity75			0
' she and her husband @entity9 , a plumber , had already suffered heartache when @entity10 ’s twin @entity78 died a few weeks after the sisters were born			0
now six months old , @entity10 has been discharged from the @entity47 and is expected to grow into a healthy child earlier this month , research @entity81 ( @entity81 ) found that more premature babies born when their mothers are just 24 weeks pregnant are surviving - but babies delivered earlier rarely live			0
their research appeared to find a cut - off point in terms of chances of survival at 24 weeks - the current legal limit for abortion			0
but they found no improvement in the proportion of babies born 22 - 25 weeks who experience serious health problems into childhood the figures suggest that while rising numbers of babies born very early are being helped to survive , the number of children and adults with long - term disability as a result will also increase .			2

@entity26 , from @entity67 , @entity68 , was born at just 23 weeks
doctors were unsure whether she would survive , or whether they should try and save her
when they weighed her , she was 1lb , the minimum weight for a baby to be considered viable
after fighting to save her they discovered she had only weighed 382g , and a pair of scissors accidentally left on the scales had bumped up her weight
