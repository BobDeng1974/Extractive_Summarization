by @entity0 for the @entity1 hundreds of thousands of elderly people are struggling to get out of bed in the morning , wash themselves and prepare meals because they are not getting enough support at home , research reveals			2
nearly 900,000 over- 65s are being denied help with essential everyday tasks by either carers or family and friends , according to @entity16			1
this includes 500,000 who have difficulty having a bath , 190,000 who need help getting up , and 160,000 who are struggling to cook for themselves			0
new research has revealed that 900,000 oaps are being denied help at home with basic tasks such as cooking dinner or having a bath by either carers or relatives the charity blames cuts to council budgets which has resulted in local authorities imposing much stricter criteria to decide who is eligible for state - funded help at home			1
in some cases carers call for just 15 minutes a day meaning tasks are rushed or left undone			1
the @entity1 has long campaigned for improved care for older people at home and in hospital as part of our dignity for the @entity54 campaign			2
age @entity16 analysed the results of a national survey of 10,600 over- 65s which assessed whether they were being given help with everyday tasks			1
nearly a third – 31 per cent – of those who struggle to carry out some daily activities said they did not get enough help from either carers or family			1
@entity65 , of @entity16 , said : ‘ it beggars belief that one in three older people who need some basic help with daily living are now having to do without it			2
‘ when older people begin to need some help with essential daily tasks like eating and washing they should expect that it will be there for them , yet it is increasingly beyond their reach			2
‘ this is profoundly shocking , and it ’s a direct result of our care system being scaled back at the same time as the population of older people is growing			2
' our national failure to invest properly in social care not only deprives older people of vital support , it also makes no economic sense			0
charity blames council funding cuts meaning stricter criteria is used to decide who is eligible for home care ‘ for example , an older person who struggles to eat is more likely to become ill and need expensive hospital treatment than if they receive some regular help with their meals : social care helps older people to stay well and keep their independence for longer			1
older people deserve so much better			0
’ based on its findings from the survey , the charity estimated that 870,000 people aged 65 to 89 are not being given enough support with basic everyday tasks			1
this figure also includes 200,000 who need help taking medication , 590,000 who dress themselves with difficulty , and 120,000 who need assistance with going to the toilet			0
according to @entity16 , the amount spent on social care has been cut by £ 1.2billion since 2010 , over which time the elderly population has increased			1
@entity123 , @entity124 ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ this research paints a depressing picture of a generation of older people facing loneliness , neglect and struggling to cope at home			0
‘ @entity131 has allowed home care support to be withdrawn from thousands of people			0
this is a false economy and one of the main causes of the intense pressure on @entity138			0
’ last year research by charity @entity140 found that half of councils are granting elderly and disabled only 15 - minute carer visits			0
it said the slots were so short that vulnerable residents were forced to choose between having a cup of tea or going to the toilet .			0

research finds @entity152 are being denied help by carers or family and friends
many are being left to do everyday tasks such as cooking or *cleaning*
age @entity16 blames cuts to council funds meaning access to care is *restricted*
