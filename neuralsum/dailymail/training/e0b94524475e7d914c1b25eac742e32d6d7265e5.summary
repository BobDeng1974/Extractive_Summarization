all smiles : @entity18 before she was questioned about @entity3 's capital on the @entity15 tip of her tongue : @entity7 searched desperately for an answer but one of the hosts eventually jumped in and told her the capital of @entity3 is @entity24 ' oh , um , ah , oh my gosh , ' she hedged , clicking her fingers while she struggled to answer the question			1
the host took pity on the beauty queen and told her the answer : @entity24			0
' thank you , i was going to say that ! i was like , that one @entity36 host on @entity37 , back in the day , his name , that 's how i always remembered it , ' @entity7 said , but was also unable to name the host she was thinking of			2
someone supplied the answer , and she said , ' @entity43 , that guy ! ' cheater ? newly - crowned @entity8 @entity7 answered questions about her @entity3 residency in an interview with @entity48 @entity7 won the coveted title competing as miss @entity3 , but some have claimed that she did not really live in @entity3 , so should n't have been allowed into that state 's pageant			1
she has stated categorically that @entity3 is her home and that she did not cheat her way to victory			0
' nothing could have been more thrilling for me than to have won the @entity8 title			0
i have lived in @entity3 since the fall of 2012 and it was an honor for me to represent the state at @entity8 , ' she said in a statement			1
after three consecutive failed attempts to win the @entity65 crown , in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , @entity7 , 24 , won the @entity67 competition in january			1
however , unnamed sources have suggested that @entity7 only met the @entity3 pageant 's minimum residency requirements to compete for the crown , but she did n't actually live in the @entity3			1
' she never actually moved to @entity3 , but continued to work at @entity72 and live in @entity13 , setting up some minimum paper trail to appear like she was in @entity3 and allow her to compete , ' a ' well - placed ' source told @entity48			1
' @entity74 is the @entity3 director , and she personally coached @entity18 on what she needed to do to qualify in @entity3 and skirt around the need to be actually from there			0
' @entity13 girl : miss @entity78 won the competition last sunday night , but sources say she lives in @entity81 not true : @entity7 says there 's ' no truth ' to the claims and that she has been living in @entity85 , working as a model , for the past 18 months which is more than the six - month residency rule @entity74 won the @entity8 competition in 1995 and went on to become the director of the @entity3 pageant in 2011			1
however , @entity7 says there 's ' no truth ' to the claim she received special treatment			0

' [ @entity85 ] is my home , ' @entity7 said			2
' i have a house there with a friend			0
' the @entity103 told @entity104 there is ' no reason to question her residency			0
' could they have won ? @entity110 , @entity111 ( left ) came second in the contest and @entity114 @entity113 ( right ) came a respectable third in line to the crown small pond : sources say many @entity13 girls set up residency in @entity3 because there 's fewer women to compete against in the neighboring state nervous embrace : @entity125 @entity110 , left , and @entity126 @entity7 await the final decision ' i actually had an agent that was working with me in @entity3 a lot so i figured why not work in that state , and then i looked into the pageant program because i had done pageants before , ' she explained			1
' so i figured why not look into the one in @entity3 ? i really liked the way that it was run , the director that ran it , it seemed like a really healthy , well - run state program			2
so i decided to go there since i was living there anyway			0
' according to her @entity8 application , @entity7 currently works for @entity145 which has branches in both @entity85 and @entity81 but her profile with the company lists her as living in @entity13			1
she defenends the profile , saying that 's where all the lucrative modeling jobs are at but that most of her work is done in @entity85			2
before that , she worked at @entity155 as a princess and competed in the @entity65 competition in 2010 , 2011 and 2012			1
another source said @entity13 pagaent queens often cross the state line to compete in @entity3 becamase ' it was easier there '			2
strutting her stuff : miss @entity78 takes the runway during the evening gown portion of the pageant here i am ! miss @entity78 takes the runway during the swimsuit portion in @entity13 , pagaent girls went up against 100 - 200 other women whereas there were only 33 in the pool for @entity3 's competition			2
@entity7 says it 's just not true that the competition is eaiser in @entity3			2
' at least this year in @entity3 , we had such strong compeititon			0
all the girls were not only beautiful , they were smart , college - educated well - rounded women …			0
i think it was a really tough competition			0
' however there are other pagaent insiders who think it 's wrong to move to compete in a different state , even if the girls do it according to competition rules			0
' most women are really proud to represent their home state , and it starts to become unfair to the hometown contestants competing when this happens , ' said @entity195 , a former @entity196 representative for the @entity65 pageant			0
' if you ca n’t win at home , you have no business competing elsewhere			0
' fighter : @entity7 , seen in her taekwondo uniform , received criticism for saying women should learn to defend themselves against sexual assault			0

@entity8 @entity7 could n't answer when asked what the capital of @entity3 is
she was participating in a radio quiz on the @entity15 when she was asked
a host jumped in and supplied the answer for her
critics have claimed @entity7 set up a *phoney* residency in @entity3 where the state competition was smaller
she continued to live and work in @entity13 where she competed in 2010 , 2011 and 2012
@entity7 shot down the claims and said she has been living and working as a model in @entity85 for the past 18 months
