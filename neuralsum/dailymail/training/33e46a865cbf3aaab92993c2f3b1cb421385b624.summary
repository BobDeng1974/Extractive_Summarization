@entity7 went to her nearby ' walk - in ' minor injuries and illness unit after her heart starting racing			1
already having suffered five heart attacks she thought she was having another and was taken to the @entity14 in @entity15 , by her concerned husband rather than waiting for an ambulance			1
@entity14 in @entity15 where @entity18 was ' told to ring an ambulance ' when she was suffering a suspected heart attack however , when they arrived staff said she had not been referred to them by a doctor or been brought in by an ambulance and they could not accept her as a patient			1
her husband @entity28 was advised to go outside and dial 999 for an ambulance			2
the pair remained outside waiting for paramedics who immediately treated the 33 - year - old before taking her back into the hospital where she had been refused treatment minutes earlier			1
mrs @entity36 ’s husband said he was trying to get his wife the fastest treatment possible and felt calling an ambulance to their remote home , in the village of @entity44 , would take too long			2
mrs @entity36 has already suffered five heart attacks , one serious , in 2008 and has problems with a blocked artery which leads to her heartbeat unexpectedly rising sharply			1
mr @entity50 instead took her to @entity14 where there is a cardiac unit			1
staff at the minor injuries unit refused to admit her and suggested she go to @entity56 15 miles away for a @entity58 examination			1
mr @entity36 , 44 years , said : ' i could n’t believe it			0
there are so many procedures			0
“ i said " why do n’t you just cut the red tape and give me the referral otherwise my wife is going to die "			0
' having been told to call an ambulance the couple waited in the hospital ’s ambulance bay for the paramedics to arrive			0
he said they looked ' slightly flummoxed ' by the situation but took her into a hospital corridor to treat her			0
mrs @entity36 said : ' somebody at some stage , with the way it is going , is going to die because they have n’t had the urgent treatment they need and i do n’t want to be the first			0
