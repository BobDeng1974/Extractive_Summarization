by @entity0 the great leader certainly left his mark on this vehicle , which was specially modified with a heated footwell , an extra-wide passenger seat and a wooden box believed to be for his bricklaying tools			0
now the @entity9 which was custom built for sir @entity11 's 80th birthday has sold at auction in @entity13 , @entity14 , for £ 129,000 - more than twice its estimate			1

@entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 ’ - has less than 13,000 miles on the clock			1
present : the 1954 series 1 @entity9 was custom built for sir @entity11 's 80th birthday working fine : the @entity9 is in good condition today and has less than 13,000 miles on the clock it was modified so the former @entity29 prime minister could be chauffeur - driven around his sprawling 300 - acre @entity21 estate , and was sold with the original logbook registering it to him			1
the vehicle , which had been expected to fetch only £ 60,000 at the @entity36 auction , was sold for just £ 160 by @entity11 ’s relatives more than five years after his death in 1965 aged 90			2
it had been presented to @entity11 as an 80th birthday present in 1954 by @entity9 , and was registered ‘ @entity42 ’ just three days later , with the ' uke ' thought to refer to the ' @entity41 '			2
the manufacturers also added a padded fold - down arm rest in place of the eight - inch wide middle seat , and a leather - clad grab handle was fitted to the bulkhead			0
provenance : the logbook shows the name and address of sir @entity11 in @entity21 , @entity23 inside : the @entity9 was fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate the prime minister @entity11 retired from politics in 1955 and it was later passed onto his son - in - law , the politician @entity57 , before it was sold off in a farm sale in the early 1970s for £ 160			1
the vehicle was bought by a @entity60 , who asked his friend @entity61 to help transport it			0
but when mr @entity61 found @entity11 ’s name in the logbook , he immediately bought it for double the price			0
however it was used to tow the @entity68 ’s horse box before they put it away for storage - aware of its fascinating history - and it had been kept in a shed in @entity23 since 1977			1
mr @entity61 believed @entity11 used the wooden box , fitted into the pick - up bed , for storing a trowel and mortar so he could indulge in his hobby for bricklaying whenever it suited him			2
@entity11 became prime minister during @entity80 in may 1940 and helped inspire the nation to victory , before losing power in 1945			0
