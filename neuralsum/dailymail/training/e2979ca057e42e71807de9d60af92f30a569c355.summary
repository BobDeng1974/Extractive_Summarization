by @entity0 @entity1 allowed himself a two - day celebration after winning @entity3 at @entity4			1
after winning his first @entity6 on sunday , it was more like two hours			0
monday lunchtime and the @entity8 was back at work , on a scouting trip for the season ’s final major , the @entity11 at @entity12 this week			1
greatness waits for no man			0
but what we are seeing right now is on another level			0
it is not what very good or even top - class golfers do			1
it is what men who define eras do			0
‘ i just want to see how many titles i can win and then enjoy them at the end of the year , ’ he said			1
‘ i know i ’ve have had some success this season but i do feel i ’ve a few more left in me			2
’ there has only been one golfer in my working lifetime for whom @entity52 were not enough or @entity54 , and so the symmetry at the @entity30 on sunday was perfect , if somewhat poignant			1
as poor @entity58 was being led from the scene crocked , his days of thinking like this shattered forever , his successor strode into the arena looking the epitome of athleticism			1
not since @entity58 was in his prime have we seen a mood descend like the one over the back nine at @entity22 on sunday			1
the margin between @entity1 and the luckless @entity24 was only a stroke for much of the time , yet the final outcome did not feel in doubt			1
‘ i ’ve never felt so comfortable trying to close out a tournament , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it felt like the first or second round rather than the fourth			0
’ when a player reaches that stage , he is in the happiest place of all			0
and when you combine it with @entity1 ’s gifts and single - minded pursuit of maximising them , we are back in @entity58 territory , where the opposition feel intimidated before they begin			1
@entity24 is playing as well as he has for a decade and began with a three - stroke lead			2
but never did you sense a player who felt he could truly win			2
the @entity91 has been one of the best drivers of the ball for 15 years but looked positively cowed next to the awesome @entity1			1
watching on television , @entity94 , no mean driver of the ball himself in his heyday , came to a momentous conclusion : ‘ in all my time in the game , i ’ve never seen anyone drive the ball like @entity1 did last week			1
’ @entity101 defined his era by dominating the opposition with the elixir of power and accuracy from the tee , and when he managed to putt well into the bargain , he won			0
no 1 : after victories at the @entity3 and @entity21 , @entity1 is now top of the world rankings sealed with a kiss : @entity1 finally gets his hands - and lips - on the @entity114 at @entity4 in july video the @entity116 highlights that is how @entity1 will do it as well			1
ok , the fairways at @entity22 last week were soft , and the ball was not rolling into the rough			1
that will certainly improve a man ’s driving - accuracy stats			2
against that they were narrow targets , particularly if you are flying the ball more than 325 yards through the air			0
yet @entity1 missed just two fairways per round , and not one all week by a sizeable margin			1
it was stunning to behold			0
why has it all gone right for @entity1 ? the bottom line is he has fallen head over heels back in love with his sport			1
he has ditched all the baggage and re-dedicated himself			0
winner : @entity1 has won his third @entity140 at the age of 25 , becoming only the third to do so @entity1 's success at the @entity30 owed a lot to his driving			1
the 25 - year - old led the field in driving distance with an average of 334.8 yards , and , remarkably maintained a high level of accuracy at 60.71 per cent ( tied 12th ) missing just nine out of 56 fairways			1
typically , someone who hits it as far as @entity1 ranks low down in terms of accuracy			2
@entity156 is no 1 for distance this season with an average of 314.8 yards but 98th for accuracy			0
was his former fiancee @entity162 ’s remark in april that she would like children a turning point ? @entity1 was not ready for children			1
he is 25 and wants trophies , not babies			0
‘ i never wanted to be a normal person growing up , ’ he said last week			0
‘ i wanted to be the golfer who wins majors			0
’ after @entity162 went , the next thing was the @entity173 question that had been hanging over him , and who he would represent at @entity175			0
then he had a long sitdown with @entity101 , the man who has come to look upon @entity1 with the same affection as one of his many grandchildren			2
do not underestimate that 90 - minute conversation the pair had at the end of may in all we are seeing now			2
@entity101 always recognised that @entity1 was a once - in - a - generation talent			1
he was only too happy to dwell on the fine details to help bring it out			0
i know i have banged on about @entity1 ad nauseam over the years , to the annoyance of some readers			2
‘ why do you keep writing about him ? he is not that good , ’ was the gist			0
but the point always was that he is that good			0
lead from the front : @entity1 now only needs to win the masters to complete a career @entity140 now , with everything pointing in the right direction , there is every chance the next few years will be the most exciting in the history of @entity203 golf			1
no , he will not dominate to the extent @entity58 did			2
he will not end up with 79 @entity206 victories			0
but if he can keep all the melodrama at bay — a big if , admittedly , on the evidence of the past few years — he should be winning five times or more each season and quite a few of them should be majors			0
back in march , @entity1 sat down with a few golf writers and made a comment that now carries particular resonance			2
‘ i think the game is crying out for someone to take it by the scruff of the neck and dominate and , of course , i ’d like that golfer to be me , ’ he said			0
now someone has and , yes , it is him			0
@entity1 has got the aura and when a golfer acquires that , an era surely follows .			2

@entity8 followed up his @entity3 victory with a win at @entity22 in the @entity26 @entity30
he had just two days off after his @entity4 win , and he does not plan on resting until the end of the season
@entity1 has chance to win his second major of the year at @entity12 this week
he is strong *favourite* to do so , having hit a fantastic run of form recently
the 25 - year - old has looked as good as @entity58 at his peak
@entity1 split up with fiancee @entity248 in may but that has not affected his form in recent tournaments
