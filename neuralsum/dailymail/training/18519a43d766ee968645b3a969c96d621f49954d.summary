by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has declared himself available for @entity4 's opening @entity6 match against @entity7 a week on sunday			1
the @entity9 left - back made just nine appearances last season before undergoing knee surgery in november that brought his campaign to a premature end			1
he resumed training in july and enjoyed some playing time on the @entity18 ' pre-season tour to the @entity19			1
speaking at @entity21 ' @entity20 , @entity2 said : ' i 'm feeling good			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity2 talk about finding a replacement for @entity25 raring to go : @entity26 @entity2 featured on @entity4 's pre-season tour to @entity19 captain fantastic : @entity4 skipper @entity29 trains on friday during an open session at @entity31 new faces : summer signing @entity33 trains with his new team - mates after his move from @entity7 ' i was training on my own and running a lot , and it 's not the same when you play with a team because it 's a lot more with the ball and a different type of running			1
' i 'm still getting my fitness back but i feel really good and confident that i can play soon			2
' it 's little by little , and not just me , everyone is getting their fitness			0
if the manager wants me to play in the first game of the season , i am ready of course			2
' @entity2 's fitness is a boost to boss @entity56 , who was left without a specialist left - back last season and has not been able to strengthen in that area			1
the @entity18 have been heavily linked with young @entity26 @entity61 but so far he has stayed with @entity62			1
@entity56 has still been busy in the transfer window , spending significant money on @entity7 duo @entity65 and @entity33 , @entity68 @entity67 star @entity66 , @entity70 's @entity69 and @entity71 from @entity72			1
@entity4 fan @entity73 was another player to leave @entity7 for the @entity18 while right - back @entity74 has joined on loan from @entity76			1
down to work : @entity33 will be hoping to make a strong impression following his Â£ 20m summer transfer loan star : right - back @entity74 will be hoping to challenge @entity4 stalwart @entity81 @entity83 stars : @entity85 duo @entity84 ( right ) and @entity87 challenge for the ball all will have to work extremely hard to fill the gap left by @entity25 's departure for @entity91 but @entity2 sees no reason why they can not match last season 's second - placed finish			1
' everyone says about @entity25 and of course @entity25 was a top player for us , one of the top players in the world , ' said the @entity26			1
' but we 've spent a lot of money on good players as well , we have a very good team			0
hopefully we can do the same thing as last season			0
' one advantage for @entity4 may be that the former @entity7 trio are all experienced @entity6 players			1
' it depends on the player but normally ( it 's an advantage ) , ' said @entity2			2
' it 's a different league , a completely different type of football			0
this one probably is the hardest in terms of fitness because in the @entity6 you run a lot , going wide and back more or less all the game			1
' of course if you are used to this league , normally you do well			0
that does n't mean that a player that comes from another league ca n't do well as well , but it is more risk			0
' orders : @entity18 boss @entity56 issues instructions to his players in front of the @entity31 crowds tall order : @entity56 talks to defender @entity135 , who has slipped down the pecking order void : @entity56 will be hoping that his team can find a new spark this season after @entity25 's exit strength in depth is key for @entity4 this season as they return to the @entity145 for the first time in five seasons			0
@entity2 , whose only trophy with the @entity18 was the @entity149 in 2012 , can not wait to make his debut at @entity152 's top table			2
he said : ' @entity4 has been for a while without @entity145			0
' i 've never played in the @entity145 and i 'm so excited to play in this competition because the best teams in the world are in this competition			2
i think @entity4 are one of the best teams in the world so @entity4 have to be there as well			0
' we 'll try to go as far as we can but of course not forget about the league and the two cups			0
we have a big squad and we want to compete for everything			0
' hopefully , like the manager says , we can win a trophy			0
we won one before with @entity171 ( @entity172 )			0
i know it was n't a @entity145 or a league title but it was really exciting and for the fans it 's really good to win trophies			0
' eye for the net : @entity179 striker @entity178 will have to repeat last season 's heroics without @entity25 new arrival : @entity73 will also be hoping to make an impression after his move from @entity7			2

@entity26 has declared himself fit for opening game against @entity7
@entity2 has not played in the @entity6 since surgery in november
left - back made his comeback on summer tour to @entity19
