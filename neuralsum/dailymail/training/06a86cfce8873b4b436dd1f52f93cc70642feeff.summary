the computer giant is to force users of its existing @entity6 and @entity10 email services to use the system , which officially launched today , in a bid to boost its uptake			1
the firm has also unveiled a $ 90million ad campaign - but immediately came under fire for the attack on arch rival @entity3 in the ' scroogled ' ad , which depicted the search giant 's @entity20 service as a ' snooping ' service			1
the firm hopes it will help it compete with @entity3 and @entity26 in the email market @entity3 says @entity20 has more than 425 million account holders , including those that only visit on smartphones and other mobile device			1
the latest data from research firm @entity33 , which does n't include mobile traffic , shows @entity20 with 306 million worldwide users through december , up 21 per cent from the previous year			2
@entity26 's email ranked second with 293 million users , a 2 percent decrease from the previous year , followed by @entity6 at 267 million users , a 16 per cent decline from the previous year			2
during the preview period , @entity41 attracted 60 million account holders , including about 20 million that defected from @entity20 , according to @entity1			1
@entity1 says its new online service lets users easily send pictures to friends , and integrates @entity49 and @entity50			2
@entity1 is so confident it has the @entity52 's best email service that it is about to spend at least $ 30 million to send its message across the @entity54 all users of @entity1 's @entity6 and other email services operating under different domains such as @entity10 will be automatically converted to @entity6 by the summer , if they do n't voluntarily switch before then			1
all the old messages , contacts and settings in the old inboxes will be exported to @entity6			0
users will also be able to keep their old addresses			0
' last summer , we released a preview of @entity6 , a new modern email service from @entity1 , ' @entity64 of @entity1 said			1
' since then , we 've been humbled by the fast pace of adoption with over 60 million people already actively using @entity6			0
' today , we 're excited to announce the next step in this journey : @entity6 is coming out of preview and people everywhere can get started and give it a try at @entity6			0
' today is a major milestone in our mission to provide people everywhere with the world 's best email experience			0
' experts say @entity82 remains a key battleground , even at a time when more people are increasing turning to texts and instant messaging services			0
the recurring email habit provides @entity52 companies a way to keep people coming back to websites , and gives people a reason to log in during their visits so it 's easier for email providers to track their activities			0
frequent visits and personal identification are two of the keys to selling ads , the main way most websites make money			0
@entity1 is set to force all users of its @entity10 and @entity6 service to use @entity6 - whether they want to move or not after keeping @entity6 in a ' preview ' phase since july 31 , @entity1 today officially launched it			1
to welcome new users , @entity1 is financing what it believes to be the biggest marketing blitz in the history of email			2
@entity6 will be featured in ads running on primetime tv , radio stations , websites , billboards and buses			0
@entity1 expects to spend somewhere between $ 30 million to $ 90 million on the @entity41 campaign , which will run for at least three months			2
the outlook ads will overlap with an @entity126 marketing campaign that @entity1 launched earlier this month			1
the ' @entity128 ' attacks depict @entity20 as a snoopy service that scans the contents of messages to deliver ads related to topics being discussed			0
the @entity20 ads are meant to be educational while the @entity41 campaign is motivational , said @entity135 , @entity6 's senior director			1
@entity1 hopes the new outlook service will help it take on arch rival @entity3 , who is the market leader in web email with its @entity20 service ' we are trying to push people who have gotten lazy and comfortable with an email service that may not be all that great and help show them what email can really do for them , ' said @entity135			1
by @entity1 's own admission , @entity6 had lost the competitive edge that once made it the world 's largest email service			1
the lack of innovation left an opening for @entity3 to exploit when it unveiled @entity20 nearly nine years ago			2
@entity20 is now the industry leader , although estimates on its popularity vary			0
@entity3 declined to comment on @entity6			0
the company , which is based in @entity157 , @entity158 , plans to convert all of its @entity20 users to its redesigned format within the next few months			0
@entity26 , which is based in @entity161 , @entity158 revamped its email service late last year in an effort to provide a more consistent experience on personal computers and mobile devices			0
@entity6 is the latest in a series of major product leases from @entity1 , which has been struggling to regain the cachet that once made it the world 's most valuable technology company			1
@entity1 's @entity128 campaign accuses its rival of invading @entity20 users ' privacy when scanning the contents of their emails to target them with personalised ads. the attack , the latest volley in @entity1 's @entity128 campaign , comes with a website and is aimed to boost interest in the veteran software company 's @entity6 email service			1
it follows a series of @entity128 adverts last year which targeted @entity3 's controversial privacy policies			2
scroogled ! @entity1 's website to accompany its latest campaign taking a swipe at @entity3 for its policy of scanning @entity20 users ' emails to target adverts ' @entity3 goes through every @entity20 that ’s sent or received , looking for keywords so they can target @entity20 users with paid ads , ' the website says ' and there ’s no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy			1
' it also includes a feed of quotes from @entity3 executive chairman @entity206			0
these include his infamous declaration that ' if you have something that you do n't want anyone to know , maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place			0

@entity6 will be given to all users of @entity1 's services , including @entity6 and @entity10
