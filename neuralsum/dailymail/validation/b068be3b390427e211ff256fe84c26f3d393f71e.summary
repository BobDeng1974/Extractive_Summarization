@entity6 officers have demanded that stud owner @entity7 ( right ) rips up the new public horse footpath she paid for , after the council deemed the two inch high granite edging to be a ' trip hazard to horses ' the bridleway was laid as part of a diversion order applied for by the @entity24 family , as they wanted to correct an historic route error on maps of the farm dating back to the 1950s she said : ' all they need to do to resolve this problem at no cost to the council is to certify the path , then everyone can move on and stop wasting time and money			1

ms @entity7 , who paid £ 3,000 for the new bridleway at @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity15 , called the decision ' ridiculous ' @entity6 officials admitted they forgot to mention that particular section of bridleway in their diversion order			1
ms @entity7 said : ' the officials acknowledge they made a mistake and now want the order and path changed , so the blame lies with the council officials and not me			2
' @entity61 access and bridleway officer @entity59 , added her support , saying : ' as a horse rider , i do not see their proposed changes as a problem			0
' the access is good and will not provide a trip hazard for horses			2
' in response @entity73 , county council cabinet member for planning and environment , said : ' the bridle gate ms @entity7 has built and the accompanying landscaping appear impressive and we know she has gone to some considerable effort and expense over this			2
' however , these works and others were not agreed with the rights of way officers and , as a result , there are some major practical problems that have to be overcome			0
' the county council , and in effect the taxpayer , will be responsible for maintaining this bridleway and we have a legal and moral responsibility and a duty of care to ensure it is totally safe before we can allow it , so to avoid it becoming a maintenance liability on the council in future years			0
' i am sure we can work out an amicable compromise that will suit everyone and i have asked my officers to keep me closely apprised of the progress			0

@entity7 paid £ 3,000 for new bridleway at @entity13 , @entity14
but the council deems the granite edging to be a ' trip hazard to horses '
it has now ordered the farm to tear up the two - inch high pathway edge
