they say the finds provide rare testimony of a ritual cult in the @entity11 region at the beginning of the period of the royal @entity14			1
such idol worship was a major theme in the chapters of the @entity18 relating to the era , and is given in the holy book as a cause for the downfall of the @entity24 kingdom			1
an @entity26 worker holds figurines found at the @entity29 archaeological site : the @entity26 said on wednesday they unearthed a maze - like construction and a cache of sacred vessels some 2 , 750 years old the discoveries were made at @entity29 , outside @entity11 , during archaeological work taking place ahead of new highway construction in the area			1
they were announced yesterday in a release by @entity2 's @entity40			0
' the ritual building at @entity29 is an unusual and striking find , in light of the fact that there are hardly any remains of ritual buildings of the period in @entity50 , ' the dig directors said in a statement			1
' the uniqueness of the structure is even more remarkable because of the vicinity of the site 's proximity to the capital city of @entity11 , which acted as the @entity6 's main sacred center at the time			1
' archaeologist @entity60 shows a horse figurine at the site on the outskirts of @entity11 : experts say the finds provide rare testimony of a ritual cult in the region at the start of the period of the royal @entity14 @entity29 and the surrounding region are well known for their archaeological importance			1
many finds have previously been uncovered at the site , from a range of different periods			2
from the @entity78 to the beginning of the present century , the site was excavated in preparation for the new route taken by @entity82			2
at the time , the site 's archaeologists proposed identifying it with the @entity87 settlement @entity88 , mentioned in the @entity89 - a town in the tribal lands of @entity92 bordering on @entity50 ( @entity93 18 : 26 )			0
the proposal was based , among other things , on the discovery at the site of a public building , a large structure with storehouses , and a considerable number of silos			0
a view of the @entity29 site : the area and surrounding region are well known for their archaeological importance			1
many finds have previously been uncovered at the site , from a range of different periods aerial view : according to archaeologists , the current excavation has revealed part of a large structure , from the early days of the monarchic period ( @entity118 ) at the time , archaeologists identified the site as a storehouse , run by high - ranking officials , for @entity11 's grain supplies			1
the current excavations have revealed evidence that offers a new aspect to understanding the site			0
@entity60 , one of the directors , told @entity129 that the discoveries were rare evidence of religious practice outside @entity11 during the @entity134 period			1
' what we can say for sure is the figurines served for religious purposes , and that @entity29 was a @entity140 kingdom , ' she said			2
the findings date to the 9 - 10th century @entity142 , when the @entity143 would have already been built in its @entity11 location			2
the @entity24 of that era seemed to have kept some of the prevalent @entity148 practices alongside the mainstream worship in the @entity11 temple , she said			1
idolatry : ms @entity60 points out the temple site and the altar used for religious rituals and practices			0
the finds indicate that @entity24 of that era seemed to have kept some of their prevalent @entity148 religious practices thou shalt have no other god : the worship of idols is a major theme of the @entity18 , with the @entity165 being repeatedly punished by @entity166 for their idolatry ' it 's very interesting to see these religious artifacts and temple so close to @entity11 , a walking distance , ' ms @entity60 said			1
' we know very little about religious practice during the @entity134 kingdom , there are two or three more sites of worship , and this is the closest to @entity11			1
' according to archaeologists , the current excavation has revealed part of a large structure , from the early days of the monarchic period ( @entity118 )			0
the walls of the structure are massive , and it includes a wide , east - facing entrance			0
conforming to the tradition of temple construction in the ancient @entity194 , the rays of the sun rising in the east would have illuminated the object placed inside the temple first , symbolising the divine presence within			0
a square structure which was probably an altar was exposed in the temple courtyard , and the cache of sacred vessels was found near the structure			0
this map shows the location of the @entity29 archaeological site , just outside of @entity11 , @entity2 the @entity6 was founded following the break up of the @entity208 of @entity2 after the northern tribes refused to accept @entity210 , son of @entity212 , as their king , the @entity87 says			1
the major theme of the @entity87 's narrative is the loyalty of @entity6 , and especially its kings , to ' @entity166 ' , the @entity166 , and their rejection of idolatry			0
according to the @entity87 , all the kings of @entity2 and almost all the kings of @entity6 were ' bad ' , which in terms of @entity87 narrative means that they failed to enforce worship of @entity166 alone			0
of the ' good ' kings , @entity226 ( 727 – 698 bce ) is noted for his efforts at stamping out idolatry - in this case , the worship of @entity231 and @entity232 , among other traditional @entity194 divinities			0
however his successors @entity234 ( 698 – 642 bce ) and @entity236 ( 642 – 640 bce ) are said to have incited the anger of @entity166 by reviving the worship of idols			2
the latest finds at @entity29 suggest that at the beginning of the @entity6 the worship of idols continued among the people of @entity2 - even close to the centre of their religion in @entity11			1
@entity6 was eventually overrun amid competition between the @entity249 and @entity250 empires for control of the region - after its people and king had returned to idolatry			0
the assemblage includes ritual pottery vessels , with fragments of chalices ( bowls on a high base which were used in sacred rituals ) , decorated ritual pedestals , and a number of pottery figurines of two kinds : the first , small heads in human form with a flat headdress and curling hair ; the second , figurines of animals - mainly of harnessed animals			0
the archaeologists stress that ' the find of the sacred structure together with the accompanying cache of sacred vessels , and especially the significant coastal influence evident in the anthropomorphic figurines , still require extensive research			0
' ritual elements in the @entity6 are recorded in archaeological research , especially from the numerous finds of pottery figurines and other sacred objects found at many sites in @entity2 , and these are usually attributed to domestic rituals			2
' however , the remains of ritual platforms and temples used for ritual ceremonies have only been found at a few sites of this period			2
' the site 's directors said : ' the finds recently discovered at @entity29 provide rare archaeological evidence for the existence of temples and ritual enclosures in the @entity6 in general , and in the @entity11 region in particular , prior to the religious reforms throughout the kingdom at the end of the monarchic period ( at the time of @entity226 and @entity307 ) , which abolished all ritual sites , concentrating ritual practices solely at the @entity143 in @entity11			1

finds offer evidence of a ritual cult at the beginning of the period of the royal @entity14
artefacts unearthed at @entity29 , just outside @entity11 , during a dig ahead of new highway construction
they appear to show the worship of idols was still *popular* among @entity24 of the era
