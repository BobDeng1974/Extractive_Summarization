@entity0 has insisted he will not sell @entity1 despite the danger of facing a further ban from owning the club			1
the controversial @entity5 was typically defiant after the @entity6 disqualified him from running his club due to a breach of its owners and @entity12			1
@entity0 told @entity13 on monday : ‘ i am not selling the club			1
i just bought the club and i want to protect the fans			0
’ scroll down to read statements from the @entity6 and @entity1 @entity0 ( centre ) watches @entity1 play @entity21 at @entity22 back in september it was all quiet outside @entity24 on monday as the statements were released @entity1 ' players celebrate @entity28 's strike in the 2 - 1 win over league leaders @entity31 on saturday we have today received a notice from the @entity6 disqualifying mr @entity0 from being a director of @entity1 until 18 march 2015			1
the club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision			1
in the interim , the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the @entity6 ’s @entity44 in april 2014			1
the steps that the @entity6 wishes the club to take – to remove mr @entity0 only to re-appoint him in three months ’ time - will be destabilising for the club , its supporters and sponsors and can not be in the best interests of any party			1
that could prove more difficult if @entity0 faces further sanctions			0
the @entity5 , who successfully appealed against the @entity6 ’s decision to block his takeover of @entity1 in april , was plunged into limbo yesterday after the @entity6 received detailed evidence from the @entity5 court in @entity60 that convicted him of tax evasion in march			1
last night , the 58 - year - old indicated he would appeal within the 14 days allowed			2
even if he fails to have the decision overturned , the disqualifying condition only runs until march 18 next year because the tax conviction will be declared spent under @entity68 law			2
however , @entity0 faces further disciplinary action because of his non-disclosure of the information			0
@entity0 could escape with a three and a half month ban , but his failure to cooperate will now be reviewed by the @entity74 ; a body with unlimited sanctions that could even see the club expelled from the league			2
a further possible complication is the fact that @entity0 is facing a similar tax evasion trial , again over unpaid import duty on a boat			1
the case was delayed because the judge , having heard the first trial , felt compromised			0
yesterday a @entity6 statement said : ‘ at its meeting last week , the board considered the reasoned judgment of the @entity5 court against mr @entity0 , having successfully applied to the @entity5 courts for its full disclosure			1
@entity95 actor @entity94 ( centre ) poses with @entity0 's daughter @entity97 at @entity24 on saturday the board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously [ with the exception of its chief executive , @entity101 , who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest ] that mr @entity0 is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the test			1
‘ additionally , the board concluded it was appropriate to ask an independent football disciplinary commission to consider whether mr @entity0 and / or @entity1 breached @entity6 regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information			1
the matter will be heard by an @entity74 in due course			0
’ @entity0 was in @entity115 yesterday and will only meet with his legal representatives today			0
but the @entity6 sanctions demand that the @entity1 president reduces his personal stake in the club to less than 30 per cent from the 75 per cent he currently owns			2
a statement from @entity1 accused the @entity6 of ‘ destabilising ’			2
the statue of former @entity1 captain @entity123 stands proud outside the famous old ground league rules give @entity126 just 28 days to resign as a director of @entity1 and cut his ties with the @entity130 club			2
yesterday @entity0 , who bought a 75 per cent stake of the club through a company called @entity134 , told the @entity135 : ‘ @entity0 does not own @entity1			2
my family company owns @entity1			0
it is my family ’s money which bought the club , not my money			0
’ in a separate interview with @entity144 he said : ‘ if i am not allowed to run the club i will buy a ticket and sit with the fans but i am not going to run away			0
‘ i think it ’s unfair and wrong			0
i ’m surprised so much energy and so much money has been wasted to run after something that is not just			0
i am not a dishonest person			0
i i come from @entity5 and i love this club more than someone from @entity68			0
’ the board of directors of @entity6 has , once again , considered the position of @entity1 president , @entity0 , under its owners ' and @entity159			1
previously ( march 2014 ) , the @entity155 had ruled that mr @entity0 was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under @entity5 tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat ( which resulted in him being fined € 600,000 )			1
in april 2014 , this decision was successfully appealed by mr @entity0 at a hearing of the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) chaired by an independent @entity168 ( sitting alone )			2
in reaching his verdict , @entity169 concluded that : “ mr @entity0 has satisfied me that on the facts before me , what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest			0
” before going on to state that : “ if the reasoned ruling of the court in @entity60 discloses that the conduct of mr @entity0 was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest , he would become subject to a @entity178			0
” @entity126 watches @entity1 take on @entity180 back in march before his takeover had been completed at its meeting last week , the @entity155 considered the reasoned judgment of the @entity184 against mr @entity0 , having successfully applied to the @entity5 courts for its full disclosure			1
the @entity155 considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously ( with the exception of its chief executive , @entity101 , who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest * ) that mr @entity0 is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the @entity195			1
mr @entity0 is entitled to appeal the @entity155 's decision to the @entity44 within 14 days			1
as the judgment of the @entity184 has not been published in @entity5 , @entity6 will not make any of its contents public			2
additionally , the @entity155 concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent @entity74 ( @entity74 ) to consider whether mr @entity0 and / or @entity1 breached @entity6 regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information			1
the matter will be heard by an @entity74 in due course			0
editors notes : * @entity101 was chief executive and a director of @entity1 between 2004 and 2013			0
@entity0 is pictured at @entity207 back in august			0
