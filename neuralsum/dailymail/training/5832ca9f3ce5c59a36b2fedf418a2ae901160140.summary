attack : @entity1 called for a cultural change in @entity4 banking when he spoke today the @entity5 yesterday piled pressure on the @entity7 to split the traditional high street operations of banks from their risky casino arms			1
governor sir @entity1 said the latest abuses by @entity4 lenders reinforced the need to press on with the sweeping reforms recommended by the @entity15			1
he said the proposals by the @entity15 , which was chaired by sir @entity17 and included ring - fencing retail banking from investment banking , should be implemented in full			1
it set up a potential clash with chancellor @entity22 who has been accused of watering down some of the main proposals following months of lobbying by the banking industry			2
sir @entity1 said : ‘ i would hope that @entity28 would legislate on that as soon as they feel able to do so – all of the @entity17 proposals			1
that is what we need to do to change the structure of the industry			0
’ he added : ‘ we can see what has gone wrong			2
the idea that the culture of investment banking is the same as the culture of basic banking , i think it is very clear now that those two cultures are completely different , and they need to be separated			2
’ officials played down any differences between the governor and the chancellor but the comments were seen as a warning to the @entity7 not to back down			2
it is hoped that the ring - fence will allow an investment bank rocked by heavy trading losses to fail without hurting savers , borrowers and small businesses			2
sir @entity1 said : ‘ the main thing is to ensure that if the trading mentality leads to practices that we regard as rather unacceptable that it does not impinge on the part of the banking system about which we really care			1
‘ it is very important to recognise that as a society we really do want to underpin retail deposits , lending to households and @entity72 ( small and medium enterprises )			0
‘ but we do not want to underpin people ’s decisions to take risky portfolio investments , therefore the two should not be on the same balance sheet			0
’ sir @entity1 said there was no need for a @entity82 - style inquiry , although he admitted ' something went very wrong with the @entity4 banking industry and we need to put it right '			1
yesterday , leading politicians including @entity88 's @entity87 called for an official inquiry into the conduct of banks , after it emerged @entity93 and @entity94 were embroiled in attempts to fix the inter-bank lending rate			1
prime minister @entity97 , pictured arriving for an @entity99 leaders summit in @entity100 this week , insisted the government was committed to shaking up the banking system taxpayer - backed @entity103 also confirmed it was being investigated for manipulating the rates at which banks lend to each other , known as @entity106			1
sir @entity1 said : ' from excessive levels of compensation , to shoddy treatment of customers , to a deceitful manipulation of one of the most important interest rates and now news of yet another mis - selling scandal we can see we need a real change in the culture of the industry			1
' he added that hard - working bank staff have been ' let down ' and that banks now needed ' leadership of an unusually high order '			1
@entity97 insisted the government was committed to shaking up the banking system			0
‘ @entity4 people are crying out for a return to good old - fashioned banking and not put that at risk by big investment banking , ’ said the prime minister			2
‘ that ’s why the governor is so in favour of changing culture at the banks and so am @entity138 ’ when the @entity140 was published this month sir @entity17 welcomed the proposed legislation but said that it ‘ should go further ’ on some points			1
‘ we welcome that the @entity15 proposals have been accepted in large part but urge the government to resist pressure to weaken their effectiveness , ’ he added			0
the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) revealed earlier that @entity93 , @entity152 , @entity103 and @entity153 had agreed to pay compensation to customers who were mis - sold interest - rate hedging products			1
some 28,000 of the products have been sold since 2001 and may have been offered as protection - or to act as a hedge - against a rise in interest rates without the customer fully grasping the downside risks			2
the @entity164 regulator has slammed banks ever since for authorising the deals , which are so complicated that many entrepreneurs simply did n't understand them			0
many of those clients are now facing bankruptcy			0
speaking during a visit in @entity173 with war veterans ahead of @entity175 tomorrow , @entity87 called for an inquiry into the whole industry and said it was clear that change was needed at @entity93			1
his calls were backed by shadow chancellor @entity181 , who said there was a case for an inquiry into the culture of banking , while business secretary @entity187 voiced no objections			2
inquiry : @entity88 leader @entity87 , pictured yesterday , said it was clear that change was needed at @entity93 while shadow chancellor @entity181 , right , said there was a case for an inquiry into the banking culture the @entity196 , presided over by @entity82 , was set up by prime minister @entity97 in july last year to look into the ethics and practices in the press following the phone hacking scandal that has engulfed @entity201			1
the @entity88 leader said : ' we definitely need an inquiry into the culture and practices of the industry			0
' what 's been revealed with @entity93 is a set of practices which have appalled people across the country and we 've got to make sure we shine a light in all the corners of the industry to find out why these practices have been going on and what it is about the culture that has enabled this to happen			2
' he added : ' i think its pretty clear the change that is required at @entity93			1
' i think it 's very hard to see that being led by @entity223			0
' if i was a shareholder in @entity93 i would be asking myself ' well , obviously we need big change here			2
who is going to be able to bring that change and restore confidence in @entity93 and the system ? ' scandal : @entity93 boss @entity223 will forgo his bonus after the bank was hit with a record fine over market rigging ' i am calling for change at @entity93			1
it 's obviously a matter for the shareholders in the end but i think that it is very hard to see how the current leadership , who were there when some of these things were going on , can bring about the changes required			0
' mr @entity181 told @entity247 : ' i do n't think it 's right for the government ministers or the governor to say we have had enough inquiries			0
' why is there a culture where people in quite senior positions seem to think they can get away with rigging markets and acting in a duplicitous way ? ' i do think that these calls we are seeing today for a proper , independent , arm 's - length inquiry which looks at the future and how we can get back on to a more open and honest footing , but also looks at the self - regulation of the 1980s and 1990s and the way in which the @entity151 regulated in the last decade - i think there is now a case			1
' we ca n't just brush this under the carpet			0
people are shocked by the swaggering arrogance of what we have discovered in the last 24 hours			0
we need to open this wide open			0
' on wednesday it emerged that @entity93 was fined £ 290 million by @entity4 and @entity277 regulators for manipulating the rate at which banks lend to each other , and echoes the costly payment protection insurance ( @entity282 ) mis - selling scandal that emerged last year			1
banks are facing the threat of a criminal investigation over fixing the interbank lending figures that affect millions of homeowners and small firms			0
the @entity7 has started to look at strengthening criminal sanctions for those responsible for market abuse after the @entity151 exposed the dealings at @entity93 on wednesday			1
under the spotlight : @entity152 and taxpayer - backed @entity103 are among several other lenders being investigated by the @entity164 watchdog @entity297 investigators are in talks with the regulator over the scandal , while pressure is mounting on @entity93 chief executive @entity223 to stand down			1
prime minister @entity97 said it was very important that accountability for what went on ' goes all the way to the top of that organisation ' and that mr @entity223 had ' some serious questions to answer '			0
' heavy price ' : @entity311 general secretary @entity310 said @entity4 's banking system was ' out of control ' @entity152 and taxpayer - backed @entity103 are among several other lenders being investigated by the @entity164 watchdog for trying to influence @entity315 interbank offered rate - and @entity317 interbank lending rates to boost their profits			1
sir @entity1 said there needed to be a change in the way @entity106 was calculated based on ' observations of actual market transactions ' rather than getting banks to supply rates			1
' the idea that my word is my @entity106 is dead , ' he added			0
he also backed proposals to ringfence retail banking divisions from investment arms as a way of addressing some of the issues that have emerged from the most recent developments			0
@entity311 general secretary @entity310 said @entity4 's banking system was ' out of control '			0
he said : ' we are now paying a heavy price for the decades when banks and finance persuaded politicians that they were the new engines of growth			0
' shadow chancellor @entity181 disagreed with the @entity345 and said there was a case for an inquiry into the culture of banking			2
he said : ' we ca n't just brush this under the carpet			0
people are shocked by the swaggering arrogance of what we have discovered in the last 24 hours			0
