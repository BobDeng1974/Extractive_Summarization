a gardener has broken the record for growing the world ’s biggest gooseberry - four years after losing the crown to a rival green - fingered pensioner			1
@entity5 , 53 , has produced the fruit which weighs 64.49g - around the size of a large egg			1
it is the first gooseberry ever to weigh more than 40 pennyweights - an ancient system used to measure the popular summer treat			1
bumper crop : @entity5 , aged 53 , @entity14 at @entity15 poses with his prized ' @entity16 ' @entity5 ’s whopping gooseberry outweighed the previous record - breaking fruit - grown by pensioner @entity18 , 76 , in 2009 - by over two grams			1
mr @entity18 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , beat @entity5 after a bitter row over weighing methods which vary between regions			1
@entity24 eventually ruled in mr @entity18 ’s favour but this week @entity5 reclaimed the crown with his prized fruit			1
@entity5 , resident gardener at elegant @entity15 in @entity28 , @entity29 , grows 30 types of gooseberries on 100 different trees in between his official duties at the stately home			1
whopper : a standard @entity36 is totally dwarfed by @entity5 's @entity37 sized @entity36 , right he feeds his gooseberry bushes with a secret nutrient recipe and monitors their progress round - the - clock from his cottage in the grounds			2
speaking today , @entity5 , a professional gardener of 31 years , said he was thrilled to net the new record			2
married @entity5 , who has three grown - up daughters , added : ' i ’m absolutely delighted to reclaim the record			2
' i had to have witnesses there as well as the secretary of @entity51			0
previous record holder : @entity53 , 73 , pictured with his award - winning @entity36 in 2009 ' i did n’t know if it would set the record until it was picked and weighed , i could n’t believe it when i found out the weight			1
' everyone was really pleased for me and delighted that i ’ve brought the record back to @entity29 , since it ’s been in @entity61 for a few years			2
' the nicest thing was the previous record holder , @entity18 , rang me the next day to congratulate me			1
' i ’ve been doing this for years , it ’s my hobby			0
i came from a village called @entity67 in @entity29 where everyone grew and shared gooseberries , so it went from there			0
' my dad and neighbours grew them , and we entered competitions - it ’s become a bit of an obsession			0
' i take most of the gooseberries off the trees , that helps the others to grow bigger			0
' with the bad weather , last year was hopeless , and there was only one grown weighing over 30 pennyweights			0
this year is much better			0
' @entity86 , 54 , secretary of @entity51 said he knew the gooseberry would be a record breaker when he saw it dangling on the branch			0
he said : ' i was really pleased for @entity5			0
he ’s worked hard over the years with his gooseberries and deserves to reclaim the record			0
' i ’m sure other @entity29 gooseberry growers will be delighted for him , and hopefully it will attract new members			2
' the record gooseberry was absolutely huge , it was the size of a large duck egg or a kiwi			0
his is the first gooseberry over 40 pennyweights , a fantastic achievement			1
' @entity5 ’s gooseberry , measured according to @entity29 ’s rules , weighed 41 pennyweights and 11 and a quarter grains			1
mr @entity18 previously held the record with a 39 pennyweight ( 62.01 g ) fruit grown in his back garden			1
eclipsing all others : @entity5 , @entity14 at @entity15 , puts other @entity36 growers in the shade with this prized specimen a row broke out due to a difference in the weighing systems used by @entity117 and @entity61 growers when the pensioner submitted his world record claim in 2009			1
@entity24 adjudicators eventually found in mr @entity18 ’s favour after working out the weight of his fruit in grams			2
gooseberry growers in the @entity117 record their weight in pennyweights and grains , with a pennyweight equalling 1.55g			2
growers across the @entity130 changed to a system of drams and grains , with a dram equalling 1.77g			0
pennyweights and grains have been used to measure goosberries for around 250 years			0
rivalry between the pair dates back 20 years when @entity5 first claimed the world record in 1993			2
mr @entity18 beat his fruit in 2009 until @entity5 ’s latest gooseberry broke the world record again this year			1
@entity5 said : ' gooseberries take a lot of nurturing , you have to feed them a lot of manure , you must cover them from the rain and prune others to let the bigger ones thrive			0
' @entity153 and mr @entity18 have enjoyed a friendly rivalry for years and no doubt he ’ll be back in his garden planning how to beat me with next year ’s crop			0

@entity5 , 53 , from @entity29 , has produced the fruit which weighs 64.49g
giant specimen outweighs previous record held by pensioner @entity18 , 76 , since 2009 - by over two grams
it is the first gooseberry ever to weigh more than 40 pennyweights - an ancient system used to measure the popular summer treat
