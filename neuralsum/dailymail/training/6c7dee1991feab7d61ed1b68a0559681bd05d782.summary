if @entity1 need a boost after their pre-season defeat against @entity4 , they 'll get it in the shape of @entity6 this week			1
in the grand scheme of things their 1 - 0 loss to @entity10 's side in @entity11 does n't mean an awful lot			1
but if there were any glum faces on the six hour flight back to @entity21 on sunday morning , the sight of their new Â£ 30million man should turn those frowns upside down			2
subs ( not used ) : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48			0
goals : @entity50 33 ' @entity1 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity51 ( @entity52 46 ) ; @entity53 ( @entity54 46 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 46 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 ; @entity59 ( @entity60 46 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 46 ) , @entity63 ( @entity64 46 ) ; @entity65 ( @entity66 46 ) , @entity67 ( @entity68 71 ) ; @entity69 ( @entity70 71 )			1
attendance : 25,219 @entity6 is due to report to @entity72 to start pre-season this week , with @entity75 duo @entity74 and @entity76 due to follow soon after			1
@entity77 takes his side to their annual @entity80 training camp tomorrow afternoon knowing his squad is slowly taking shape			1
defeat , albeit in a friendly is never ideal , but their whistlestop tour of the @entity86 was always more about commercial gain than football			0
@entity77 started with a strong starting @entity89 , @entity61 , @entity59 , @entity51 , @entity67 and @entity63 all selected			0
with @entity76 still on his summer holidays , @entity77 's lack of options at centre - forward saw @entity69 start as a lone striker			0
but it was the hosts who carved out the first chance , with no prizes for guessing who was at the forefront of the move			0
@entity10 's perfectly timed run was spotted by former @entity103 winger @entity35 , but for once the @entity75 's finishing was wasteful as he fired wide			2
old friends : @entity10 embraces @entity77 control : @entity67 takes on @entity107 clutched : @entity4 goalkeeper @entity25 claims the ball at @entity61 's feet commitment : @entity10 tackles @entity61 high riser : goalscorer @entity24 gets up for a header @entity67 stroked a curling effort from the edge of the area just wide before @entity10 turned provider for @entity24 - @entity119 legend @entity118 's adopted son - in the ninth minute but the former @entity120 missed the target			1
you could n't help but smile when @entity37 clattered into close friend and @entity124 team - mate @entity59 in midfield , before @entity63 's strike from @entity69 's pass rolled just wide of @entity129 's far post			0
after an action packed opening , the encounter started to settle down , though flashes of @entity10 magic was enough to keep the crowd interested			2
and the the @entity137 side took a deserved lead in the 33rd minute through @entity24			1
predictably , @entity10 had a hand in the goal , his corner causing havoc in the @entity119 defence before @entity24 nipped in front of @entity51 to toe - poke home with a finish his dad would have been proud of			1
@entity61 , making his first pre-season appearance of the summer , went close to levelling five minutes later after a brilliant one - two with @entity65 , but his effort from eight yards was brilliantly saved by @entity25			0
the @entity151 midfielder , intent on getting back into @entity77 's good books after his infamous trip to @entity155 , went close again four minutes before the break - but his goalbound strike from the edge of the box was blocked by @entity37			0
@entity77 made a host of substitutions at half - time , among them @entity75 duo @entity60 and @entity64			0
and the changes nearly paid instant dividend , when @entity66 set up @entity67 only for the @entity166 to fire straight at @entity167			2
harried : @entity63 is fouled by @entity37 claim : @entity51 rises highest to catch the ball tangle : cahill battles for the ball with @entity1 's @entity65 @entity10 , as you would expect , was given a standing ovation as he was substituted in the 54th minute			1
and @entity1 nearly took full advantage of the @entity4 talisman 's exit when @entity60 , put through by @entity62 , stroked the pall past @entity25 - but the effort was ruled out for offside			1
but the visitors ' bright second half opening gradually waned , despite the efforts of the impressive @entity62 in central midfield			0
@entity66 raced through with 12 minutes left on the clock , but with just @entity25 to beat the @entity119 choked in front of goal leaving the goalkeeper to make a comfortable save			2
but the hosts should have sealed victory just a minute later when substitute @entity42 sent his free header over the bar after @entity40 's cross .			0
