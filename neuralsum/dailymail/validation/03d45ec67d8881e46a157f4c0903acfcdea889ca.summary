@entity0 was accused of having ‘ lost his marbles ’ yesterday after painting an ‘ apocalyptic ’ picture of @entity4 under another five years of @entity6 government			1
the @entity7 launched a @entity9 dossier suggesting three government departments – the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 – would ‘ disappear ’ if the @entity13 kept cutting spending at the current rate			2
later however , mr @entity0 was forced to admit that even he did not believe the @entity10 would be abolished			1
the 31 - page @entity9 document painted a bleak picture of life under a @entity6 ‘ 35 per cent state ’ , a reference to plans to reduce public spending as a proportion of gdp			1
it suggested police cuts would fuel crime , a third of elderly people who receive state - funded social care would have it stopped and the @entity38 ‘ as we know it ’ would cease to exist			2
@entity45 ’s ‘ 1930s plans ’ would also mean the @entity40 being reduced to its smallest size since @entity42 , the dossier suggested			2
mr @entity0 insisted a conservative @entity46 would have to make £ 70billion of spending cuts to eliminate the budget deficit by 2017/18			1
he suggested avoiding some of the ‘ extreme cuts ’ outlined in the document would be possible only by raising @entity52 , slashing the @entity38 budget or imposing charges for healthcare			1
but he declined to set out how much spending labour would cut if it regains office , or where the axe would fall			0
asked if he ‘ seriously believed that the @entity6 will close down the @entity10 or close down the @entity12 or close down the @entity11 ’ , mr @entity0 said : ‘ no i do n’t think that			1
’ when asked why such scenarios were included in the dossier , he said : ‘ because what the document says is if the government was to do those spending cuts , which are bigger in the next parliament than in this parliament , on the same basis as in this parliament , that would mean closing the @entity10 and the @entity11			1
we do n’t think they ’ll do that			0
’ public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018 - 19 , according to the @entity77 's forecasts of spending cuts the @entity13 accused @entity0 ( pictured above ) of ‘ absurd scaremongering ’ after he launched a @entity9 dossier which suggested three government departments could disappear under the a @entity6 government even the @entity84 ’s assistant political editor @entity83 described the scenario as ‘ an apocalypse ’			1
a @entity9 aide added that the document had set out an ‘ implausible scenario ’ to illustrate the difficulty of the @entity13 achieving their deficit reduction plan			1
conservative party chairman @entity92 said the analysis was ‘ nonsense ’			2
he said his party had pledged to cut £ 30billion in the next parliament – £ 13billion from departmental budgets , £ 12billion from welfare and £ 5billion from closing tax loopholes			0
it sounds like the politics of the playground			0
former @entity9 star @entity102 claims he and @entity103 are n’t friends any more			0
the ex-culture minister , now the @entity84 ’s strategy chief , gave an interview saying he had always been close to mr @entity103			0
but he later called the @entity108 journalist to insist : ‘ when i said i was friends with @entity0 , that ’s not completely right			2
i ’m not friends with @entity0 any more			2
’ the exchange simultaneously raises questions about the @entity84 ’s left wing ties and sheds light on insecurity among its upper ranks			0
‘ i think @entity0 has lost his marbles on this , ’ he said			1
‘ he is making up a set of figures today and i think fairly ludicrously already having to back track from his speech in which he claimed the next @entity6 government would be closing down major government departments			1
‘ that ’s a sign of how chaotic @entity9 is			0
’ mr @entity0 insisted that to achieve a budget surplus by the end of the next parliament , mr @entity45 would have to deliver ‘ colossal cuts ’ to public spending			1
‘ an unprecedented £ 70billion of spending cuts would be deeply destructive and close to impossible , even for this chancellor , ’ he said			1
‘ so @entity45 must surely have an alternative plan in his back pocket			2
these would lead to the smallest police force since comparable records began , the smallest @entity40 since @entity42 , and over a third of older people receiving social care losing their entitlement to it			0
‘ there is a real risk that the chancellor will be forced to break his promise to ring - fence the @entity38			2
’ @entity9 has committed to only tiny spending cuts such as removing the winter fuel allowance from the richest pensioners			0
treasury minister @entity152 said yesterday : ‘ @entity0 has today confirmed @entity9 ’s policy of billions of pounds of tax rises , more borrowing and more debt			2
’ @entity9 's doom - laden dossier says the @entity13 ’ ‘ extreme plans ’ would mean £ 70billion in cuts and have a ‘ crushing impact ’ on public services			1
shadow chancellor @entity0 end of the @entity38 @entity164 : @entity9 said @entity6 plans are ‘ so extreme as to make them close to impossible to deliver while maintaining current projections for areas such as the @entity38 ... a 35 per cent state is not compatible with an @entity38 as we know it			1
if the @entity13 were to abandon the ring - fence , this could lead to £ 10billion being cut from the @entity38 budget			0
’ reality : the @entity6 - led @entity175 has repeatedly protected @entity38 spending from cuts – despite complaints that this has meant more painful reductions elsewhere – and repeated a pledge to ensure real - terms increases until 2020			1
elsewhere in the world , the worst health cuts have come in countries that failed to control public spending – such as @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
@entity10 closed @entity164 : if cuts fell on government departments on the same basis as they did in this parliament , three of them – the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 – would ‘ cease to exist ’			1
reality : even @entity0 admitted this scenario was absurd			2
questioned afterwards , he said : ‘ i do n’t think they ’re going to abolish the @entity10 ... i do n’t think they ’re going to abolish the @entity12			0
’ @entity199 cut to 1970s levels @entity164 : in the next parliament , mr @entity0 said @entity6 plans ‘ would be equivalent to 29,900 police officers lost and 6,700 @entity203 [ police community support officers ] lost ’			1
this would take the overall numbers of police on the streets well below 100,000 and well below the levels of the late 1970s			0
reality : crime is the best illustration of the @entity6 mantra that it is possible to do ‘ more for less in public services ’			1
despite @entity9 ’s warning in 2010 that home secretary @entity218 was taking ‘ huge risks with the public ’s safety ’ by cutting police funding , crime is down by more than a fifth			0
smallest army in 350 years @entity164 : @entity9 suggested @entity6 plans would mean ‘ the smallest army since @entity42 ’			1
there would be 34,500 fewer soldiers and 60,800 fewer personnel , which would ‘ fundamentally impact on the @entity4 ’s ability to project power around the world at a time when we face multiple threats ’			1
reality : like @entity9 , the @entity13 have not guaranteed they will maintain defence spending at the @entity238 target of 2 per cent of national income , currently met by the @entity4 and only four other @entity238 countries			0
but @entity241 has repeatedly pledged the @entity40 will face no further cuts in manpower			0
he told the @entity244 in january : ‘ as long as i am prime minister , the @entity40 will stay at its current size			0
’ elderly denied @entity246 @entity164 : @entity9 says it is ‘ safe to assume ’ that ‘ even deeper ’ cuts would ‘ have to be delivered through further restrictions on eligibility ’			2
it forecasts that the number of older people receiving state - funded social care would fall by 260,000 – a third of the current total			0
the dossier says services would be withdrawn from people ‘ who might struggle with daily living activities such as getting washed or dressed , or making a meal ’			0
reality : at the cost of £ 1.6billion a year to the taxpayer , the @entity175 is introducing a cap of £ 72,000 on the amount people have to contribute towards their own care , and introduced the first national guidelines on who should qualify for free care			0
@entity9 has suggested there will be no extra money for social care provided by local authorities under its plans			0
@entity0 told the @entity84 in january : ‘ there will be no additional funding for local government unless we can find money from somewhere else , but we have not been able to do that in the case of local government			1
