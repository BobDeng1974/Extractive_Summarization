the manned version of the @entity2 spacecraft is ready to undergo a series of crucial safety tests in a bid to return @entity6 to manned spaceflight			1
@entity8 hopes the capsule , dubbed @entity10 , will be ready to take astronauts to and from the @entity12 by 2017			1
@entity2 recently posted two photos of the test vehicle on @entity15 , writing : ' @entity6 's next - gen crewed spacecraft is almost ready for a test flight			1

@entity8 hopes the capsule , dubbed @entity10 , will be ready to take astronauts to the @entity12 by 2017 the ' pad abort ' trial , which will take place in the next few weeks , will reveal how the @entity30 - replacement will behave if there is a problem during launch			1
former astronaut @entity34 explained that during the test , @entity2 will sit on a truss structure instead of a @entity38 rocket			1
' we 're going to have a crash - test dummy inside and a prototype seat , so we 'll get data from that , ' @entity34 said			1
' we 're going to have a very flight - like propulsion system as far as everything that goes into the abort , including the avionics , which are going to be identical to the avionics we plan for the flight vehicle			0

eight @entity66 rocket engines will push the spacecraft away from the truss platform , launching it several thousand feet into the air			1
three parachutes will then unfurl and the @entity2 will , hopefully , land the @entity72 just offshore @entity73			0
if all goes to plan , the second test will see @entity2 ' dragon 2 take to the sky on a @entity38 rocket			2
in september , @entity8 revealed that @entity78 and @entity2 will both build @entity6 's first private spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the @entity12			1
@entity78 will be the first commercial company to carry a @entity8 astronaut to space in july 2017 under a contract with the @entity6 space agency , followed by its competitor @entity2 , officials said last month			2
@entity8 is funneling billions of dollars to both companies so that they can replace @entity6 access to the orbiting @entity12 after the @entity6 space shuttle program was retired in 2011			1
the announcement of $ 4.2 billion for @entity78 and $ 2.6 billion for @entity2 was made in september 2014			0
however , a legal challenge by @entity92 -- which was developing a space - shuttle - like vehicle called @entity94 and was closed out of the competition -- meant that officials could not reveal many details until now			0
commercial crew program manager @entity98 said at a press conference in @entity100 , @entity101 that @entity78 would be the first to make two contracted missions to carry @entity8 astronauts , since it has completed two milestones so far , and @entity2 just one			2
the long - awaited $ 6.8bn deal to replace the @entity106 and end reliance on @entity109 's soyuz craft was revealed at the @entity110 , where launches will take place from 2017			2
under the deal , @entity78 will be given $ 4.2 billion and spacex $ 2.6 billion			0
@entity8 hopes it will spur private development in space			1
' ideally several years from now there will be other laboraties where people will be going - that 's the vision of a commercial space industry , ' said @entity8 administrator @entity120			2
the contracts include at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one @entity8 astronaut aboard to verify the rocket and spacecraft system can launch and dock to the space station			1
once each company 's test program has been completed successfully , each contractor will conduct at least two , and as many as six , crewed missions to the space station			0
@entity2 and @entity78 said last month that they are on track to carry out their first manned test flights to the space station in 2017			2
@entity6 manned launches ended with the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011			0
until @entity2 and @entity78 begin flying crews from @entity73 , @entity8 astronauts must continue to hitch rocket rides with @entity109			2
@entity8 's commercial crew program manager , @entity98 , said the average price for a seat aboard the @entity2 and @entity146 capsules will be $ 58 million			2
that compares with $ 71 million a seat charged by @entity109 under its latest @entity8 contract			0
if all goes to plan , the second test will see @entity2 ' dragon 2 take to the sky on a @entity38 rocket			0

pictured is a prototype model of the @entity2 craft ' i do n't ever want to have to write another check ' to the @entity166 after 2017 , said @entity8 administrator @entity120 , a former shuttle commander			1
' if we can make that date , ' he said , referring to 2017 , ' i 'm a happy camper			0
' unlike the @entity109 charge , the $ 58 million per - person cost estimate includes a fair amount of cargo to be flown aboard the @entity2 and @entity78 spacecraft , along with four crew members			0
the @entity30 holds a maximum of three people , with at least one a @entity109 to pilot the craft			0
@entity2 president @entity178 said the future enhanced @entity2 capsule could carry five astronauts â€” one more than @entity8 's stipulated four - and still meet all the cargo requirements			2
the @entity157 , @entity158 , company , led by billionaire @entity154 , was the space station 's first commercial shipper			0
it 's been successfully delivering supplies since 2012 with the @entity2			0
@entity78 's @entity188 will take crews of seven people to the @entity12 and other destinations from 2017 , it was revealed @entity78 's vice president and general manager for @entity100 - based space exploration , @entity196 , said an unmanned test flight of the cst - 100 capsule in 2017 will be followed a few months later by the first crewed test flight			1
that first manned mission will include one @entity78 test pilot and one @entity8 astronaut , he said			2
@entity2 said an unmanned test flight could occur as early as 2016 , followed by a crewed flight in 2017			0
@entity205 has previous said @entity8 would n't be able to do deep - space exploration if it was still saddled with getting supplies and people to low - @entity211 orbit			0
' we 're about going to @entity214 , ' he said			0
the @entity78 capsule , interior view of a prototype pictured , will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit			0
it is in direct competition with @entity2 's manned @entity2 capsule			0

the pad abort test will take place in @entity20 in the next few weeks
@entity227 will reveal how craft will behave if any problems during launch
eight rocket engines will push spacecraft away from a truss platform
there will also be a test dummy placed inside the @entity10 spacecraft
@entity8 says it hopes the capsule will be ready for flights to the @entity12 in 2017
