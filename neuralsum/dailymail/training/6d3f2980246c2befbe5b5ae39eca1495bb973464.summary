by @entity0 @entity1 are set for a rare astronomical phenomenon tonight as an asteroid blacks out a star in the night sky			1
163 @entity6 , a 45 - mile ( 73 - kilometer ) - wide asteroid in the asteroid belt between the orbits of @entity10 and @entity11 will eclipse the brightest star in the @entity13			1
this so - called occultation will last no more than 14 seconds , around 2 a.m. edt ( 0600 gmt )			1
where to look : looking southwest ( 90 ° to the right of the @entity17 ) around 2 a.m. edt on the morning of march 20th			2
@entity18 will appear roughly as high as the @entity17			2
it 's the brightest star in the area			2
around 2 a.m. or a bit before , go out and face the @entity17			2
extend your arms straight out to your sides			0
@entity18 will be straight above your right hand , roughly as high as the @entity17 is			0
it 's the brightest star in that area			0
what makes this unusual is the brightness of @entity18 and the potential viewing audience of around 20 million people			0
weather permitting , the eclipse should be visible with the naked eye from @entity1 and elsewhere along a populated swath in the @entity35 and eastern @entity36			1
the star will vanish from sight for up to 14 seconds around 2:06 a.m. edt on the morning of the 20th for @entity1 , and a minute or two later farther north			1
' @entity18 shines right through moonlight and light pollution that 's in the sky — even the light pollution over a city like @entity1 , " says @entity39 , a senior editor at @entity40			1
' just be sure to shield your eyes against any glary lights , and @entity18 should be easy to find			0
' think of it as a space - rock eclipse of a star			0
' where it will be visible : the predicted occultation path			1
the blue lines show the outer edges of the zone where @entity18 will be blacked out if the prediction is perfect			0
astronomers use the term occultation for these events , from the @entity63 word for ' hid '			1
' i 've been using a telescope to go after asteroid occultations of really faint stars for ages			1
i never thought we 'd get one in my life for a star this bright and easy			0
' this is the first time in history that an occultation of such a bright star by an asteroid has been predicted to cross such a heavily populated area			1
@entity18 will vanish behind the asteroid 163 @entity6 for several seconds on the morning of march 20 , 2014 , for well - placed skywatchers			1
asteroid occultation timers — an elite specialty crowd among amateur astronomers — hope to enlist thousands of everyday folks in a citizen - science project to document this event more thoroughly than any asteroid occultation has been before			1
you can participate with just your eyes , or with a dslr camera in movie mode , or with better gear if you 're into serious astronomy stuff			0
this effort is being spearheaded by the @entity93 ( @entity93 )			0
its website for the public telling all about the event and how to participate is occultations.org / @entity98			0
the double asteroid @entity101 and big , roundish @entity100 blotted out faint background stars on july 19 , 2011 , and march 23 , 2003 , respectively			2
the goal is to see whether the star disappears as seen from your location , and for how long — especially if you can time the event to high precision			2
from this data , astronomers hope to obtain a very precise profile of @entity6 's size and shape , something that can not be done any other way short of sending a spacecraft there			0
this has been done for many asteroids in the past that have occulted fainter stars .			0

will occur at *2am* @entity1 time and be visible with the naked eye
asteroid is @entity129 in the asteroid belt between the orbits of @entity10 and @entity11 .
occultation will last no more than 14 seconds
