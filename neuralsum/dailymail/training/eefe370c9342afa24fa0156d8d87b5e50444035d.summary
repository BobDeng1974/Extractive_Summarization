by @entity0 @entity1 's £ 2.5bn new @entity2 opens tomorrow with the first flight - a @entity6 service from @entity7 - due to land just before 6am			1
but due to the @entity11 debacle in march 2008 , when one in five flights were cancelled and 28,000 suitcases went missing , @entity1 development director @entity8 and his team are opening @entity3 in stages			1
@entity6 will be the only carrier to begin with and , for the first few days , @entity3 will only operate at 10 per cent of its total capacity			1
by october , @entity6 will be joined by more than 20 other airlines , including @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			2
@entity41 ’s domestic operation , @entity42 , will also be using the new terminal			2
when fully occupied , @entity3 will be home to 26 airlines and will have more than 330 flights a day to more than 50 destinations			1
mr @entity8 said , ' opening a new terminal is one of the most complex challenges that any airport can undertake			2
' ' we ca n't guarantee that opening day will be perfect			2
there is a very high risk of things happening ( on the first day ) when you carry out a live operation for the first time			0
' @entity60 , director of the @entity63 campaign , said : ' the opening of @entity3 is a cause for jubilation , demonstrating what can be achieved by private sector funding of nationally - significant infrastructure			1
gateway to the world : the departure area of the new ' @entity73 ' , which is expected to manage up to 20 million passengers every year breath of fresh air : visitors walk past a doorway at the new building , which replaces the old , overcrowded @entity32 which had stood since the @entity80 but he added , ' the refurbishing of an existing airport terminal at @entity85 ’s busiest airport does little to relieve the huge pressure on @entity30 aviation capacity ... the @entity30 is falling further behind international rivals because the industry can not invest in urgently - needed runways			0
' officially named @entity2 , @entity91 , the @entity92 and the @entity93 will officially open @entity3 on june 23			1
heathrow bosses said that this time around they had ' sought advice from other airports around the world and learnt lessons from opening @entity11 '			1
under the managership of the west @entity85 airport 's development director @entity102 - @entity100 , the creation of @entity3 has been accompanied by numerous test runs involving thousands of volunteers			1
more than 180 trials for @entity3 have taken place over the last six months involving 14,000 volunteers			1
extensive trials of the systems were carried out , with everything tested - from individual aspects of terminal operations , such as the check - in process , to large - scale trials that test the complete passenger journey @entity3 replaces the old @entity117 at @entity1 which closed in 2009 after 54 years of service			1
new look : inside @entity1 's @entity2 which is due to open to passengers next week it boasts 60 check - in gates and 66 self - check - in kiosks , 29 security lanes , 33 shops , 17 restaurants , more than 7,000 seats , 634 toilets and 42 water fountains			1
@entity130 also include a @entity132 store and a @entity134 restaurant			0
by the end of the year it will be handling passengers at the rate of 15.8 million a year and it has been built to take up to 20 million a year			0
shafts of natural light and high quality acoustics should make the building a calm space for travellers accustomed to high anxiety at dark , noisy airports , said lead architect @entity147			0
' you can never completely erase your memory of the @entity151 , because it was a dreadful experience			0
this will be completely the opposite			0
this will be a destination			0
people will want to come here , ' he said			0
the completion of the £ 2.5billion project is part of an £ 11billion refurbishment designed to keep @entity85 's biggest airport competitive with other major @entity164 hubs including @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
causing a debate : the @entity170 's @entity169 was broadcast from new terminal last week striking : the @entity27 sculpture is the centrepiece of the development , hanging 18m above the ground with a design intended to evoke the path of a plane in flight home to 25,000 staff , @entity3 is part of an overall project that includes not only the terminal building but also a 1,712ft satellite pier , a 1,340 - space car park , an energy centre and a cooling station			1
it will host 26 airlines , including @entity6 , @entity190 , @entity38 and others that are part of the global @entity193 , and offer flights to 51 destinations			0
check - in will be large enough to accommodate 3,000 passengers an hour and an average of 55,000 passengers will arrive and depart a day			0
there will be more than 50 shops , as well as 17 bars and restaurants			0
officials say the terminal will be the first in the world to offer a ' complimentary personal shopping lounge where trained stylists will present a curated range of products for each client			0
' the interior of the new terminal is dominated by a huge aluminium sculpture hanging 18m above the ground that is inspired by the flight path of a stunt place			2
@entity30 artist @entity29 's ' @entity27 ' weighs 77 tonnes and is 78m in length , its vast bulk looming above the terminal 's main lobby and escalators , evoking the journeys that those who see it are set to embark on			0
one of the features of the new terminal will be the ability of passengers to check in at any desk regardless of which airline they are travelling with			0
passengers will be able to take their meal on board from all the @entity3 restaurants and travellers are also being promised that there will be a selection of dishes guaranteed to be ready in 15 minutes			1
royal approval : the official name for the new site is terminal 2 @entity91 future of travel : an average of 55,000 passengers will arrive and depart at the new terminal per day passengers have been warned to expect teething troubles at @entity3 this summer and the airport 's bosses said the challenge of opening a new terminal should not be underestimated			1
during the @entity257 in 2008 , thousands of bags were sent astray while passengers faced long queues after problems delayed staff from getting to work			2
' the chance of a completely smooth opening for any airport terminal in the world is low , ' @entity1 's development director @entity102 - @entity100 said			1
he added that even with immense pre-planning , there was the chance of a passenger ' turning left instead of turning right ' on the terminal 's opening day tomorrow .			2

first flight will touch down early tomorrow *morning*
@entity1 bosses have ordered a *phased* opening of @entity3
@entity92 and the @entity93 will open officially on june 23
extensive testing carried out to avoid repeat of 2008 chaos
