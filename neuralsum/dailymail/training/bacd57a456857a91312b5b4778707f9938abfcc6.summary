in 2013 out of the blue @entity12 , 25 , asked her for a date after telling her he found her @entity4 updates interesting			2

she realised they had met before after spotting a rocking horse and remembering playing on it as a child			1
@entity12 ( top left ) and @entity41 ( bottom right ) had attended the same prep school and discoverd this photograph of them together after visiting their old maths teacher @entity12 began messaging @entity11 on @entity4 after he found her status updates interesting when @entity11 visited @entity12 's house for the first time she realised she had visited it as a child after recognising a rocking horse she had played on ' we found out that i had been to this house before because one of my best friend 's knew his sister and my mum took us both round to play once			1
' and the first time i went to his house i saw a rocking horse and i remembered playing on that			1
' the rocking horse now has great sentimental value to the pair who hope to give it their own child one day			1
' we 've now bagsied it so we can have it in our home and our kids can plays on it ' added @entity11			2
in school @entity12 was a few years above @entity11 and they had n't had much interaction explaining why they had n't recognised each other immediately the couple pieced their link to each other when they went to the home of a family friend who was also their former primary school maths teacher			1

in the picture @entity11 around 10 years - old and @entity12 is about 12			2
@entity11 , who is doing a phd in obstetrics and gynecology , said that their immediate attraction might be explained by their shared history			2
the couple moved in together just a few months after meeting ' we just got on so well , everything just felt right from the start			0
' it was really strange we started talking and he said " where do i know you from " and i think i must have added him because i recognised his name from school			0
' we realised we both actually went to the same school , but he was two years above me so we never actually interacted with each other much			0
' construction worker @entity12 said that he was instantly attracted to @entity11 and their joint past was just added bonus			2
' i had her on @entity4 and i kept seeing her statuses about what she was studying and i was really interested by them			2
@entity12 proposed to @entity11 in december last year under the @entity123 lights ' i thought she looked really nice , so i decided to send her a message			1
' it was really strange to find out we went to school together and we started to find out a lot more things , like her coming round my house when she was younger			0
