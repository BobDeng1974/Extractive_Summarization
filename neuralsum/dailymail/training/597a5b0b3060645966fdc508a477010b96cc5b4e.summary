it was already shaping up to be one of the greatest missions this decade , but now @entity3 could turn out to be one of the most amazing space endeavours of all time			1
remarkable new photos have shown that its target , @entity10 is actually what is known as a ‘ contact binary ’			1
this means it is likely two comets stitched together , in what could turn out to be both a blessing and a curse for the spacecraft as it nears its approach			0
stunning images of the comet @entity3 is heading towards were released last month			1
shown here , they reveal that the comet previously thought to be a single object actually has two parts			1
how these two parts came to be is not known , but more information will be gleaned in the next few months according to the @entity29 , how the comet took this form is unknown			0
a contact binary occurs when two celestial objects , such as asteroids or comets , slowly move towards each other until they are touching			1
the slow approach of the two means they will form a single - oddly shaped body , rather than rebounding of one another			2
nine near - @entity42 objects are known to be contact binaries			1
however , it is estimated that as many as 15 per cent of all near - @entity42 asteroids more than 650 feet ( 200 metres ) in size are actually contact binaries			2
it could have been fractured in the past or it could be two different objects that very slowly came into contact at speeds of a few metres per second			2
what is certain , though , is that it poses some intriguing problems for @entity56			2
the most notable will be the planning landing of the @entity59 probe on its surface in november			2
this will be the first cometary landed ever attempted - but now a decision will be made on what part of the comet to land on			2
irregardless , @entity3 is still planning to enter orbit around the comet on 6 august			1
the orbit will gradually be lowered to 19 miles ( 30 kilometres ) once the gravitational field of the comet is known - which could be more odd than expected given its shape			1
the new observations suggest the comet is 2.2 by 2.5 miles ( 3.5 by 4 kilometres ) in size , reports the @entity76 's @entity75			0
according to @entity59 navigator @entity81 , ‘ navigation around such a body should not be much more complex than around a nucleus of irregular spherical type			0
’ but , he adds , ‘ landing the @entity59 probe , however , could be more difficult , as this form restricts potential landing zones			2
’ the images taken by @entity3 reveal a two - lobed comet rather than the single comet expected			1
this could make a planned landing in november by the @entity59 probe more difficult			1
@entity3 is due to enter orbit on 6 august after ten years of travel , when more will be known about the comet			1
credits : @entity56 / @entity3 / @entity96 for @entity97 et al speaking to @entity99 , astrophysicist at the @entity96 and part of the team analysing results of the @entity3 mission , said : ' @entity105 does seem to be made of two lumps			1
' on one hand this is unexpected , because the shape model we had based on observations from @entity42 did n’t predict a binary structure			2
that just highlights the importance of these missions - they tell us more			0
' on the other hand , three of the five comets previously visited by spacecraft seem to be composed of two chunks too , so it could be that binary comets are quite common			0
' now we need to find out what this is telling us			0
is this a result of the way comets form , or is it a consequence of their evolution ? ' hopefully , @entity3 will point us to the answer			2
the @entity132 , where this comet is believe to originate , seems to have a very high fraction of binaries , up to 30 per cent depending on where you look , which is also interesting			0
' it could be that many of these objects start out as binaries			0
' in terms of the landing , i think the binary shape just raises more interesting questions			2
' where do we land so that we maximise the science return ? technically , it probably does not change much			0
the landing will be challenging no matter what			0
' the @entity3 spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet @entity10 ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
it will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in august , becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet @entity3 will seek to help scientists unlock the composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and evolution of our solar system			1
the probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times , picking up energy from @entity42 and @entity174 to line it up with its final destination : @entity177 – @entity178			0
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity3 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity181 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			1
@entity3 will enter orbit around the comet in august , before putting its @entity59 lander onto the comet ’s surface in november			1
while in orbit it will perform extensive analysis of the comet 's composition , which will provide us with an insight into the history of the solar system and discover the origin of comets			0
@entity3 has been firing its thrusters to cut by almost two thirds the speed with which it 's hurtling towards the comet			1
there will be a total of four before @entity3 comes within 62 miles ( 100 kilometers ) of the comet in early august , beyond the orbit of @entity174			1
the final rendezvous will require two more precision maneuvers			0
the probe , launched a decade ago , will spend time observing @entity213 before dropping a lander called @entity59 onto its icy surface in november			0
if the @entity59 lander is successful it will become the first vehicle ever to land on a comet			0
the comet is about 2.5 miles ( four kilometres ) long and orbits the @entity221 every six - and - a - half years			1
once at the comet @entity3 will follow it on its journey around the sun , performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface			1
the spacecraft 's speed will be slowed in order to remain in orbit , bringing it to roughly about walking pace relative to the comet			0
in november of this year the @entity59 lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet ( artist 's illustration shown ) , which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet			2
here , harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings the comet is heading towards the sun , so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more			0
even though it is still more than 370 million miles ( 600 million kilometres ) from the sun - more than four times the distance between @entity42 and sun - its surface has already started to warm , causing its ices to turn to gas and escape from its rock - ice nucleus			0
as the gas escapes , it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space , which slowly expands to create the coma			0
the warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity rises , and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of the material to stream out into a long tail			0
this will give @entity3 some fascinating opportunities to observe the comet 's emissions and find out more about its composition			2
@entity3 and the comet will be closest to the sun in august 2015 , when they will be between the orbits of @entity42 and @entity174			1
on 25 feb 2007 the @entity3 spacecraft returned this stunning image of @entity174 as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet			1
the picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the @entity59 lander at a distance of 620 miles ( 1,000 kilometres )			0
below the solar array an area close to the @entity293 region is visible on the planet 's disk			0

stunning images of the comet @entity3 is heading to have been revealed
@entity300 - based @entity56 have yet to comment on what they mean for the mission
images reveal a two - lobed comet rather than the single comet expected
this is something known as a ' contact binary ' , when two objects in space ' stick ' together
could make a planned landing on the comet in november more difficult
@entity3 is due to enter orbit on 6 august after ten years of travel
