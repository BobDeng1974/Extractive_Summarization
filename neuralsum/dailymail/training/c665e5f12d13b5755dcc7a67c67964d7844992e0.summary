by @entity0 these extraordinary images detail the remarkable similarities between humans and our closest living relatives , bonobos			2
sharing 98.7 per cent of human dna , the fascinating creatures exhibit the same expressions , mannerisms and behaviour as man displays on a daily basis			0

remarkable : photographs of our closest living species show just how similar they are to us , sharing 98.7 per cent of dna close inspection : the fascinating creatures exhibit the same expressions , mannerisms and behaviour as man displays on a daily basis their natural habitat is the @entity34 basin , in the @entity35 , where they suffer horrendous atrocities and are currently listed as endangered			1

intelligent : from turning taps on and off for a drink to cuddling their babies the great apes are the closest thing to observing a human in a zoo affection : it 's hard not to wonder what the bonobos are thinking when we see them displaying similar actions to ourselves , such as a mother cradling a youngster relaxing : their natural habitat is the @entity34 basin in the @entity35 where they suffer horrendous atrocities and are currently listed as endangered			1
this troop was photographed from their home in a @entity41 zoo fascinating : wildlife photographer @entity38 , 42 , captured these magnificent moments at @entity40 in @entity41 , where he has become gripped with watching how the young bonobos grow up @entity38 , originally from @entity71 , @entity72 , but now living about 10 miles from the zoo said : ' i have been observing them for close to five years - mostly when i 'm not travelling as it 's so close to me			1
' i instantly grew attached to the @entity77 as they are fascinating primates - it has become almost an on - going study watching them grow up and get older and how they learn their mannerisms			0
embrace : a young bonobo gazes into the camera while being embraced in a bear - hug by an affectionate adult ageing : a youngster sits protected by a a circle of adults and adolescents , left , while right , an older bonobo , who 's head hair has fallen out , sits alone companionship : the bonobos huddle together as they snooze in the early morning sun routine : even the little ones get groomed by the adults as part of their daily routine ' the babies are just like human babies , very comical , playing and fighting between each other			2
the mannerisms are just so close to the way we act - there is only one chromosome difference between us and you can really see it			0
' until they are five or six - years - old they have childhood characteristics whereas the adults are more chilled as we are sitting back watching their young play together			0
the youngsters were often watching the adults and being taught new tricks , such as turning the tap on and off observing : the primates seem content to simply watch each other , in between eating , grooming , sleeping and playing wildlife photographer @entity38 , is fascinated by observing the behaviour of our closest living species , especially how the young @entity77 are reared ' they know when and pay attention to humans as you show up - it 's when the babies start showing off when they know people are paying them attention just like human children			1
' they 're not a well - known primate most people think of chimpanzees but i got interested in them and then i did my research and it kind of grew from there			0
