' stay strong and keep your heads to the sky			0
' his last meal consisted of eggs , bacon , doughnuts and an orange drink			0
@entity39 spokesman @entity38 said @entity0 later turned down the sedative valium and the sedative midazolam			2
the convicted killer could be seen in the execution chamber at @entity45 state prison talking to family members through the glass in an adjacent room , with his body covered by a white sheet			1
once the state started injecting 5 grams of pentobarbital , his chest heaved for several seconds then stopped			0
his jaw went slack and he displayed no other movement for the rest of the process			0
four of @entity0 's family members sat in a room to his left and looked on without reaction as the drug killed @entity0 in about eight minutes			1
speaking after the execution , mr @entity2 's brother , @entity64 , noted that it had been about 7,500 days since the killing and said the family has missed him every one of them			1
he described his brother as a hard worker , generous and with a memorable laugh			0
at times , mr @entity64 paused to compose himself as tears rolled down his cheeks			0
' it would just take a coward to want to hurt someone like him , ' he said			0
according to court records , @entity0 had decided to rob the gas station with his half brother and half sister on april 14 , 1994			2
he entered the store , drew a gun and told @entity2 , 53 , to put $ 400 in a money bag			1
the half brother , @entity86 , then took the money to the car , while @entity0 ordered mr @entity2 and the young girl to a back room			1

@entity0 was arrested a week after the crime when police responded to a tips hotline call			2
his execution is the ninth in @entity9 this year , meaning 2014 currently ties with 1999 for having the most executions in a year in the state			2
at a time when executions have gone awry in @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , @entity0 's death occurred without any visible complications with the drug or equipment			1
@entity0 's fate was sealed tuesday when governor @entity141 declined to grant clemency and the @entity144 @entity143 turned down his appeal			1
court appeals claimed the death penalty for @entity0 was unfair for several reasons			2
the original jury deadlocked and a judge sentenced him to death			0
when that was thrown out , an all - white jury gave @entity0 , who was black , the death sentence			2
in 2002 , the @entity144 @entity143 ruled that only a jury could impose a death sentence			0
@entity0 's lawyers contended that a @entity9 @entity143 ruling after the @entity144 @entity143 decision led the state to commute at least 10 other death sentences for inmates sentenced by a judge to life in prison - everyone except @entity0			1
attorney @entity166 said @entity0 essentially was penalized for successfully appealing his first conviction			0
the clemency request to governor @entity141 said @entity0 turned his life around in prison , becoming a devout @entity172 who helped other prisoners			2
the petition also cited abuse @entity0 suffered as a child , saying his mother began giving him alcohol when he was five and that he later became addicted to alcohol and drugs .			0
