@entity0 , a former minister and the @entity2 's cousin the most senior member of the @entity2 clan has laid the blame of the migrant shipwreck that killed about 950 people on the western countries which helped overthrow @entity9			1
@entity0 , a former minister and @entity2 's cousin , said the ' overwhelming chaos ' in @entity12 ' has become a shame that will haunt the countries that had participated in the destruction of the @entity12 armed forces in 2011 '			1
but senior conservative minister @entity17 has defended the government 's role in helping to overthrow the dictator , who was well - known for his barbaric treatment of the would - be migrants			1
about 800 people are believed to have died when a fishing boat carrying migrants overturned off @entity12 waters , south of the @entity28 island of @entity29 , shortly after midnight on sunday			2
and @entity2 's cousin , who was one of several high - profile regime figures who fled to @entity33 during the 2011 revolution , believes the only solution for stability in the @entity37 is to bring back those who surrounded the country 's despotic former ruler in government			1
mr @entity0 , whose supporters claim could be @entity12 's next president , said western countries have shed ' the tears of crocodiles over democracy and human rights '			1
' the missiles of @entity50 have installed the gangsters instead of the regime , ' he said			0
' i express my astonishment			0
how have super power countries , members of the @entity56 , been incapable of realising that they are committing such a crime and not foreseeing the consequences ? ' what happened in @entity12 , @entity61 and @entity62 may extend everywhere ... and will burn all the fingers that have participated in it			1
mr @entity0 claimed a third of the population had been displaced , men and women had been imprisoned and are subjected to torture , and towns are cities are bombed			1
but mr @entity17 said it would be wrong to think that whatever has happened in @entity12 in the last few years is the cause of this '			1
he added on @entity100 5 live : ' let me remind you of something as well , which is that when @entity9 was still in power , there were periods when he simply allowed people to do exactly this , to get into boats and try to go to @entity111 – that was one of the ways in which he put pressure on @entity111			0
' colonel @entity2 's 42 - year - rule , which ended in 2011 , was characterised by tyranny			1
he murdered political opponents and dissidents , and replaced law with his ' @entity121 ' of rambling political philosophy , taught in all @entity12 schools			2
he saw himself as the leader of the @entity125 and used @entity12 's vast oil wealth to sponsor terror , shipping @entity128 to the @entity129 and sending agents to bring down a @entity132 flight over @entity133 in @entity134			1
a migrant carries a baby as they disembark from the @entity28 @entity139 vessel @entity140 in the harbor of @entity142 , @entity28 today tragedy : infrared images released by the coast guard show the rescue operation after the migrant ship capsized by the 1990s he had become a pariah , but was rehabilitated in 2004 under the @entity151 government with the despot signing an £ 120million gas contract for @entity154 with @entity155			2
the @entity133 bomber was allowed to return to @entity12 from a @entity158 prison and @entity2 intelligence officers were even allowed to operate in @entity158			1
he held out for eight months during the @entity12 revolutions of 2011 , but was eventually found hiding in a drain , dragged out by rebels , beaten and executed			2
experts have drawn links between the massive rise in would - be migrants and @entity9 - whose people were forced to call him the guide ' - but not for the reasons his cousin insists			0
the so - called ' deal in the desert ' struck by @entity155 in 2004 involved the dictator agreeing to crack down on human traffickers as well as renouncing @entity12 's possession of weapons of mass destruction and decommissioning the country 's chemical and nuclear weapons programs			1
in 2008 @entity9 sought to stiff the @entity183 for £ 4.1billion a year in return for halting the flows of migrants in and out of @entity12			2
migrants stand on board @entity28 @entity139 ship @entity140 before disembarking in the southern harbour of @entity142 today tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing @entity12 as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country in october 2010 , the @entity183 paid @entity12 more than £ 30million to stop @entity197 migrants passing into @entity111			2
the @entity12 ruler 's barbaric treatment of the would - be migrants was widely condemned			2
it was claimed his officials would round up the migrants and hold them for months or even years in horrendously overcrowded detention centres , where rape , violence and torture were common			0
the migrants would then typically be deported to @entity12 's southern border crossing with @entity210 - where they were abandoned in a harsh desert environment - or otherwise flown back to their country of origin without any checks on what they would be facing back home			1
as @entity155 's much touted ' deal in the desert ' turned sour , @entity2 gave people smugglers in @entity221 the green light to resume their trade and the migrant routes have flourished ever since			1
but mr @entity0 said the only way to bring stability back to the country is to bring back the @entity228			1
' @entity12 has become like a sick body stricken by viruses , ' he said			0
' the human trafficking is but one such virus			0
such chaotic environment is what created this phenomenon and others			0
' he also accused the @entity12 government of being in league with the criminal gangs			2
the so - called ' deal in the desert ' struck by @entity155 in 2004 involved the dictator agreeing to crack down on human traffickers ' @entity12 now is ruled by extreme criminal gangsters … in alliance with all the world 's devils : from drug dealers , human traffickers , exploiters of religion , arms traders , and international mafias			1
' is ( @entity255 ) collaborate with the traffickers by wreaking chaos in @entity12 in exchange for financial benefits			2
' ' there is an exchange of financial , political and military interests that @entity264 ( @entity255 ) benefit from so as to disrupt the scene and intimidate their enemies and extort them , in fact even make a mockery out of their weakness			0
' continuing to worship his late - cousin 's legacy , he added : ' he dedicated billions for investment in building schools and hospitals			2
' he allowed millions of @entity197 to work and reside in @entity12 without any restrictions			0
he provided free oil on many occasions in order to support neighbouring countries			0
' tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing @entity12 as extremists take advantage of the political chaos currently engulfing the country			2
with @entity255 having established strongholds in the towns on @entity291 and @entity292 , and with smaller bases elsewhere in the country , fear of capture and execution at the hands of the radical @entity298 is driving the desperate migrants to leave @entity12 as quickly as they can , dangerously overloading vessels			0
as well as the spread of @entity255 in the country , @entity12 is currently in a state of civil war - with two rival governments controlling and operating in different areas of the country			0
people smugglers are taking advantage of the subsequent chaos and confusion tearing the country apart to ply their trade with little to no threat of being caught			0
refugee route : tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing @entity12 as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country new ground : @entity255 has conquered regions of @entity62 , @entity61 and recently @entity12 ( pictured ) while building a terrifying support structure in @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity33 's @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 and @entity328 mr @entity0 added : ' the coming period requires a strong government that has experience in controlling this chaos : a government supported by the @entity12 army and police in order for @entity12 to reach the shores of safety			1
' @entity12 will not stabilise except with the actual participation of the previous regime supporters			0
' he claims the @entity2 supporters number two million and are not a party but said it is made up of several major tribes with the support of the @entity12 army and police			1
' they are the key for a solution , for peace and stability in @entity12 , ' he said			0
' they are the political experts , the military personal , the lawyers , the university professors , and the major tribal - leaders			0
' mr @entity0 called for a conference that includes all parties , including @entity255 and the @entity360			1
in his last interview with a @entity363 newspaper @entity9 accurately predicted a future without him			0
he told @entity365 : ' the @entity37 will become a sea of chaos			0
the @entity197 will move en masse towards @entity111			0
' earlier this year , mr @entity0 professed that ' not less than half a million ' migrants will set sail from @entity12 to @entity111 shores this year			1
among them , he claimed , are thousands of terrorists , who will soon be running amok in @entity111 culminating in a terror strike on the same scale as the september 11 attacks .			0
