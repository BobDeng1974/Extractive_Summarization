by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 09:20 est , 14 december 2012 ' sending strong signal ' : @entity3 defense secretary @entity2 gave the go - ahead today for two @entity5 missile batteries and 400 troops to be sent to @entity7 to defend against the threat of @entity10 rocket attacks @entity3 defense secretary @entity2 gave an order today to send two @entity5 missile batteries to @entity7 with 400 @entity3 personnel to operate them in a move by @entity16 members to bolster @entity7 's defences against the threat of @entity10 rockets			1
the go - ahead was signed shortly before @entity2 arrived on an unannounced visit to @entity7 to meet @entity3 troops stationed at the @entity23 , the last stop on a week - long trip that took him to @entity27 and @entity28			0
' the purpose of this deployment is to signal very strongly that the @entity3 , working closely with our @entity16 allies , is going to support the defense of @entity7 , especially with potential threats emanating from @entity10 , ' spokesman @entity29 said			1
@entity16 - member @entity7 has repeatedly scrambled jets along the countries ' joint frontier and responded in kind when shells from the @entity10 conflict came down inside its borders , fanning fears that the civil war could spread to destabilise the region			2
the widely expected @entity3 move follows similar steps by @entity48 and the @entity49 , which also said they will send two @entity5 batteries			1
the three countries are the only @entity16 nations with the most modern type of @entity55			2
@entity29 declined to say where the @entity3 batteries would be located and said the systems would be deployed to @entity7 for an unspecified amount of time			0
' we expect them to be deployed in the coming weeks , ' @entity29 said			0
@entity16 approved @entity7 's request for air defence batteries on december 4 , in a move meant to calm its fears of coming under missile attack , possibly with chemical weapons , from @entity10			1
the @entity5 system is designed to intercept aircraft or missiles			0
@entity16 says the measure is purely defensive , but @entity72 , @entity10 and @entity73 have criticised the decision , saying it increases regional instability			1
the decision comes days after the @entity10 government escalated hostilities with rebel forces by firing more than six scud missiles			1
@entity3 officials said @entity99 's troops fired several missiles over the last few days , suggesting the embattled president 's forces are attempting new ways to stop opposition fighters			1
the missiles were fired from the city of @entity112 towards northern @entity10 on the same day that more than 100 countries recognised a new @entity10 opposition coalition			0
the political move will further alienate @entity99 's regime and will allow more humanitarian assistance to be given to the forces battling to oust him			2
carnage : @entity10 cities , such as @entity122 ( pictured ) , have been left in ruin by the two - year conflict between president @entity99 's government forces and rebel fighters escalating violence : the use of scud missiles are thought to have been the first time president @entity99 's military has used missiles to attack insurgents during the conflict the bloody battle in @entity10 has already resulted in 40,000 deaths and the conflict has threatened political stability in the @entity138			1
the @entity3 official who revealed the missile use said there was no indication that chemical weapons were aboard the missiles			0
there had been fears over the past week that rebel advances were prompting @entity99 to consider using chemical weapons			0
the official said that more than six missiles had been fired so far - believed to be scud missiles			2
violence : smoke rises after an air strike apparently carried out by the @entity154 in @entity155 near @entity112 scuds are most often used as a defensive weapon and were often employed by @entity159 's forces during the @entity160			0
meanwhile , @entity72 's foreign ministry has denied reports that a top diplomat said @entity10 president @entity99 is losing control of his country			1
it said in a statement today that deputy foreign minister @entity169 ' has not made any statements or special interviews recently ' on @entity10 but was simply citing the stance of the @entity10 opposition while giving a speech yesterday			0
@entity72 state - owned news agencies had quoted mr @entity169 as saying that rebels might win the civil war , a comment that appeared to dramatically shift @entity72 's stance on @entity10			2
the @entity3 later commended @entity72 for ' waking up to the reality ' by acknowledging the regime 's impending fall			0
analysts viewed the diplomat 's statement as @entity72 's attempt to begin positioning itself for @entity99 's eventual defeat .			1

two @entity5 missile batteries and 400 personnel to bolster @entity16 operation
@entity2 wants to send ' very strong signal against potential @entity10 threats '
@entity48 and the @entity49 will also send @entity55 ' in the coming weeks '
comes after president @entity99 's forces fired scud missiles at rebel fighters
@entity72 denies report its diplomat said @entity99 was ' losing control of country '
