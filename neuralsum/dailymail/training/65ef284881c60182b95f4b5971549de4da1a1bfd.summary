by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 02:34 est , 8 january 2013 more stores are expected to go bust following a @entity3 that saw families tightening their belts and spending less money on the high street			1
the warning comes from the @entity9 against the background of the longest cost of living squeeze in a century			1
with families cutting back over @entity3 , the value of sales through bricks and mortar outlets in december dropped compared with last year			1
foreign factor : experts said stores were boosted by customers from @entity21 and the @entity22			2
shoppers are pictured on @entity24 at @entity25 in @entity26 the figure would have been even worse but for a last minute rush on the weekend before @entity3 , with shoppers taking advantage of savage price cuts on gifts and clothes			1
the total value of retail sales in the crucial month of december rose by an ‘ underwhelming ’ 1.5 per cent			0
but the experts said it was only the increase in online shopping – where sales rose 17.8 per cent on a year ago – that ensured total retail sales did not fall into the red			1
the figures were revealed as the @entity45 ’s fourth largest supermarket , @entity46 , announced its @entity3 sales were down by 2.5 per cent			1
customers switched to budget rivals , such as @entity50 and @entity51 , and internet shopping , which @entity46 does not offer			1
the high street is facing an unprecedented squeeze as struggling families cut back on their spending and switch to shopping online			0
families battered by rising food and energy prices , which have outpaced increases in pay and pensions for four years , are making major lifestyle changes and are spending less and less on the high street			0
retail chains closed stores at a rate of 32 a day during last year in a dramatic escalation of the crisis turning many urban centres into ghost towns			1
falling : the @entity45 's fourth largest supermarket , @entity46 , said its @entity3 sales were down by 2.5 per cent a number of household names – @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , blacks , @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81 – all went into administration			1
and the @entity9 say this trend is likely to continue into 2013			1
it said half of all squeezed families – 51 per cent – intend to cut back on food spending over the next six months			0
sales of traditional toys fell this @entity3 as youngsters switched to technology such as tablets and smartphones			1
money spent on toys that involve handling , building or the imagination were down by two per cent during 2012 , according to the @entity9			2
it said : ‘ toys did n’t have the best @entity3 ever			2
some items like @entity100 were particularly trendy , but retailers reported a shift in the @entity3 shopping pattern seeing interest for traditional toys and gifts replaced by more electronic items , tablets in particular			2
’ traditionalists will rue the change in culture , for many technology based games involve solitary play , rather than groups , and leave little room for imagination			0
apart from tablets , such as the @entity119 , @entity121 series and @entity122 , the @entity9 said there were strong sales for trendy earmuff style headphones			1
it said department stores had a good @entity3 and highlighted the huge influx of foreign tourists for the january sales , who were chasing designer handbags and shoes			1
the @entity9 said : ‘ a significant portion of the growth came from ‘ export ’ sales to customers from @entity21 , the @entity22 and @entity137			1
’ the figure rises to 67 per cent for parents with teenagers , who are finding it particularly tough to put food on the table while paying for other essentials			0
it suggests @entity147 pledges to tackle high street decline and the decision to hire ‘ @entity153 ’ @entity154 to devise a rescue plan have little chance of success			0
miss @entity155 published an action plan last year calling for measures to make it easier to change shops to other uses , more free parking in towns and cuts in business rates			2
following her proposals , the government announced that 15 towns would be given £ 100,000 each to resurrect their fortunes as part of a project that miss @entity155 will feature in a new tv series			0
but the scheme has been dismissed by critics			0
even miss @entity154 has admitted that a number of high streets are beyond saving and town centres need to be switched to other uses such as housing , schools , gyms and community facilities			0
@entity9 director general @entity185 warned of tough times , saying : ‘ during 2012 , the number of shop failures went up by about 6 per cent on the previous year			1
‘ looking into 2013 , with a tough environment there is a risk that we are going to see more of the same			0
‘ growth in sales is effectively flat once you strip out the changes in shop prices			0
‘ if you are operating in a low growth environment with costs you need to manage , that becomes more and more difficult			0
’ she said families do not have the cash to spend , which means there is little hope of any improvement			0
' queen of shops ' : @entity154 published an action plan last year calling for measures to make it easier to change shops to other uses , more free parking in towns and cuts in business rates ‘ if you look at the amount of money people have got in their pockets that is expected to continue to be under pressure			2
consumers ca n’t create money out of nowhere , ’ she said			0
the @entity9 ’s @entity228 is compiled in partnership with accountants @entity230 , whose head of retail , @entity231 , said : ‘ while consumer confidence remains low , shoppers will tighten their belts and rein in their spending , making life difficult for the average retailer			2
‘ there will be no boom and it ’s likely more than a few will go bust			0
’ @entity46 ’ disappointing @entity3 figures were driven by a shift in shopping habits towards budget stores			1
the company also lost out because it does not have as many small convenience stores as rivals and is not selling groceries via the internet			0
it is expected to make a move into online food sales later this year , while it has signed up @entity258 to front its advertising .			2
