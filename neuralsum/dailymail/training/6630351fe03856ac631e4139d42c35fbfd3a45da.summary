@entity8 , who works in construction , revealed : ' it was a quite nerve racking time because we only got back to @entity51 a couple of weeks before the wedding and i had n’t tried the dress on for about ten years , so we were n’t 100 per cent sure that it would fit			2

it ’s pretty amazing that the three of us were all the same size			0
the dress needed a new zip and some of the hems re-sewed			0
' she added : ' i felt really lucky to be able to wear the same dress that both my mum and grandma had worn			2
' the dress you get married in holds such special memories and it was really lovely to wear a dress with so much family history			2
' i had always thought the dress was beautiful and hoped that one day i would get to wear it			0
' @entity8 , whose wedding date coincided with her grandparents 62nd wedding anniversary , added : ' it had extra significance to be able to share it with them [ her grandparents ] and it will be something we will always treasure			0

before she could wear the dress , it had to be cleaned with a homemade mixture of aspirin and white vinegar			0
