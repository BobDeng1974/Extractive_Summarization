the 26 - year - old @entity0 said he mistook @entity4 for an intruder and shot her through the locked door of a toilet in his mansion home			1

‘ i kicked the door open , i tried to help her but she died in my arms , ’ he said in his first account of what happened on the night 29 - year - old law graduate @entity16 died			1
the hushed court also heard a statement from a close friend of @entity16 who said the model and law graduate had told her ‘ she would marry @entity0 if he asked her			1
she said he was intense but she loved him ’			2
he treated her ‘ like gold ’			2
prosecutor @entity56 painted a very different version of the events in the early hours of @entity59			2
he said @entity0 had shot his cowering girlfriend in cold blood			1
‘ she could n’t go anywhere , ’ mr @entity56 said			2
‘ it must have been horrific			2
’ listening : his brother and sister were in court today			1

there is no concession this is a murder ' difficult hearing : @entity0 's brother @entity111 and sister @entity112 arriving at the @entity113 this morning before listening to the grim details answers : miss @entity16 's funeral was held today			1
her family have demanded to know why their ' beautiful angel ' was blasted to death with his 9mm gun and have begged the sprinter to ' tell the truth ' about the shooting grief : miss @entity16 's dad @entity126 ( second left ) arrives at the crematorium building in @entity128 grief : @entity130 , centre left , the brother of @entity4 walks in the procession support : june @entity16 ( centre ) is comforted by another mourner at the service less than a week after her daughter was shot dead respect : @entity140 rugby player @entity139 arrives mission : her brother , @entity130 , said after the service : ' we 're going to keep all the positive things that we remember and know about my sister and we will try and continue with the things that she tried to make better ' statement : @entity0 said that he was ' deeply in love ' with his girlfriend and that she had bought him a @entity59 present as @entity0 's relatives supported him in court , the distraught family of @entity16 attended her funeral in @entity128			1
her brother @entity158 said that her death had ' left space missing inside all of the people that she knew			2
' but there was also anger			2
@entity165 , an ex-jockey who worked for @entity4 's father , called for the harshest of sentences for @entity0			1
in court the prosecutor told the bail hearing the couple had had a shouting match and miss @entity16 fled to the bathroom and locked herself in			1
she was an ‘ unarmed , innocent woman ’			1
but mr @entity41 insisted there was no evidence to substantiate a murder charge			2
‘ there is no concession this is a murder , ’ he said			1
it was theme underlined by @entity0 in his affidavit			1
he said : ‘ i fail to understand how i could be charged with murder , let alone premeditated murder because … i had no intention to kill my girlfriend			2
’ he said on the evening of february 13 they had decided to stay in and had gone to bed			0
‘ i ’m acutely aware of people gaining entries to homes to commit crime , i ’ve received death threats			0
i sleep with my 9mm under my bed			0
’ he said he heard a noise in the bathroom after getting up to close a sliding door			0
‘ i was scared and did n’t switch on the light			0
protesting : ' rot in jail , was the message from women 's groups outside the hearing tensions running high : women protest outside the @entity210 court , during the bail application hearing @entity0 has applied to the central firearms registry as collector to these firearms			1
six applications are pending , but any charge of violent crime will make it unlikely that firearm licenses will be granted			0
‘ i got my gun and moved towards the bathroom			0
i screamed at the intruder because i did not have my legs on i felt vulnerable			0
i fired shots through the bathroom door and told @entity4 to call police			0
‘ i walked back to the bed and realised @entity4 was not in bed			0
it then it dawned on me it could be her in there			0
it filled me with horror and fear			0
’ he put on his prosthetic legs , tried to kick down the door , then bashed it in with a cricket bat to find miss @entity16 dying			1
‘ she died in my arms , ’ he said			1
‘ i am absolutely mortified at the death of my beloved @entity4			0
’ as mr @entity41 read the statement , @entity0 wept and mr @entity46 halted proceedings for several minutes			1
‘ you need to concentrate on what ’s going on , ’ he told @entity74			0
statements from four friends were also read to the court which painted a picture of a ‘ humble ’ man who was considering building a future with miss @entity16			1
mr @entity46 ruled that @entity0 should be charged with premeditated murder , a ‘ category six ’ offence that will make it very difficult for him to be granted bail			1
last night lawyers for @entity0 took the unusual step of releasing his full statement			1
describing the moment he thought an intruder had broken in , the statement said : ‘ i felt a sense of terror rushing over me			0
there are no bars across the bathroom window and i knew contractors had left ladders outside			0
’ the statement told how the toilet was in cubicle within the bathroom			0
‘ on my way to the bathroom i screamed words to the effect for him / them to get out of my house and for @entity4 to phone the police			0
‘ i noticed that the bathroom window was open			0
i realised that the intruder was in the toilet			0
‘ i thought he or they must have entered through the unprotected window			0
’ he said he then opened fire believing his girlfriend was still in bed			0
the @entity290 has apologised after the 9am bulletin on radio 6 music , featuring a report on @entity0 , was followed by a song about a man shooting his girlfriend – the @entity297 version of @entity298			1
the track includes the lines : ‘ @entity298 , where you going with that gun in your hand ? i ’m going out to shoot my old lady , you know i caught her messing around with another man			0
