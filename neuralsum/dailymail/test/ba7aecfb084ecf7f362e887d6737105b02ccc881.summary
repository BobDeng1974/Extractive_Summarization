@entity1 @entity0 gov. @entity0 said wednesday that he wo n't sign a religious freedom bill that his state 's legislature sent to him on tuesday , citing influence from his politically liberal son			1
he is sending it back to lawmakers , he told reporters , for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal @entity13 – which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians			1
@entity0 said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law			1
' my son @entity23 , signed the petition asking me , @entity26 , the governor , to veto this bill , ' @entity0 said			1
' and he gave me permission to make that reference , and it shows that ... there 's a generational difference of opinion on these issues			2
' @entity23 told @entity34 that ' i love and respect my father very much , but sometimes we have political disagreements , just as many families do			1
' ' i had communicated with him my opposition to the bill , along with thousands of other @entity41 and concerned citizens around the country , ' he added			0
@entity23 works as a labor organizing coordinator for the @entity80 , @entity79 flagship office of the @entity81			2
' most importantly , ' he told @entity34 , ' i hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to @entity84 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more @entity87 and help create a long - lasting drive for change in this country , on many issues			1
' his father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory			1
' the bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law , ' @entity0 said			1
' it does n't mirror it in a couple of ways , particularly allowing the @entity105 to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims			1
' ' therefore i asked that changes be made in the legislation and i 've asked that the leaders in the @entity114 to recall the bill so that it can be amended			0
' the @entity116 jumped into the fray on wednesday , with spokesman @entity118 telling reporters that the @entity1 legislation could ' be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love			2
' ' and that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of @entity87 subscribe to , ' @entity118 said			0
' and i think , you know , governor @entity0 is obviously responding to that outcry			1
' @entity0 did n't cite any pressure other than his son 's , however			1
' my responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions , ' gov. @entity0 said at the state @entity64 , ' and to do what i can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of @entity1 , protects those of religious conscience – but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment			1
' the unusual move – sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it – means @entity0 does n't risk a veto - override in the state legislature			1
lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand , or they could do what he asks			2
@entity118 @entity116 press secretary @entity118 reacted during his daily press briefing on wednesday : ' the piece of legislation that was passed by the @entity1 legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the @entity159 legislature last week			2
' the kind of outcry that we saw in response to the @entity159 legislation being signed into law by governor @entity166 is similar to the outcry that we saw in @entity1 last night after the legislature passed that legislation			1
' we saw , you know , some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of @entity1 expressing some concern about the impact of that law , and that that law could justifiably – or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love			1
' and that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of @entity87 subscribe to			0
and i think , you know , governor @entity0 is obviously responding to that outcry			1
' but you know , obviously the next step will be for the leaders in @entity1 to determine			0
i think we 've made pretty clear what our views are on that			0
' the governor has one other option : he said he 's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that ' @entity1 wants to be a place of tolerance			2
' his concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then - president @entity200 was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in @entity159 , where a similar law took effect on monday			1
one key detail in @entity159 's version – and @entity1 ' – expands the idea of giving conscientious @entity208 a way to defend themselves if they 're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings			0
they protect against civil suits filed by private individuals , not just those pursued by the government			0
but few civil - rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people			0
state - and federal - level commissions and law - enforcement agencies typically carry them forward			1
and @entity224 law professor @entity223 told the @entity225 on wednesday that @entity13 laws have not ' been a sort of blank check to discriminate			1
' at issue is whether a @entity231 - owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values			0
typically , the issue is raised when same - sex couples seek vendors for their weddings			0
' let me make it clear , ' @entity0 said wednesday : ' this law under consideration does not extend discrimination			1
' ' what is important from an @entity1 standpoint is one , we get the right balance , ' he said			0
' and secondly , we make sure that we communicate we 're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace , our economy and our future			0
' at the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious - express rights of business owners			2
' this bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance ' between those rights and those of gay men and women , he said			0
@entity0 had initially supported the bill and on tuesday his office said he planned to sign it			2
' this is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial , but these are not ordinary times , ' he said wednesday as @entity87 watched his quick 180 - degree turn			1
@entity0 spoke to reporters outside his office at the state @entity64 in @entity65 on wednesday , saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 dad - @entity280 : @entity281 seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad as @entity1 braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious - freedom ground zero , @entity286 , the state 's largest for - profit employer , had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea			1
those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big - box chain is seen as a rare bastion of christian values in a crowded secular marketplace			0
the @entity301 family , the company founders who still own a large stake , are famous for using leadership models culled from @entity231 service traditions			0
@entity286 also is known for selling enough @entity231 - themed books to worry some religious bookstores			0
yet @entity306 , the company 's ceo , signed a statement saying that the state 's @entity13 ' threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of @entity1 and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold			1
' ' every day in our stores , we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates , customers and communities we serve , ' @entity306 said			0
@entity1 legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on tuesday			0
a similar measure that @entity159 @entity166 gov. @entity166 signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate			2
it took @entity166 less than a day to capitulate to protesters , saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to ' fix ' the law 's language			2
flashpoint : rallies like this one in @entity1 ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the @entity13 are already on the books @entity1 state rep. @entity338 ( right ) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed , but now his brainchild is in limbo ' we will fix this ' : @entity159 gov. @entity166 told reporters on tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state 's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination @entity286 is n't the only big player that would have complained if @entity0 had signed the bill			1
@entity355 said in a statement tuesday that it was ' disappointed ' by @entity159 's legislation , and would likely pile on in the @entity358			0
the @entity359 , which has had its headquarters in @entity361 since 1999 , says it is concerned about the law 's effect on future @entity159 events including this week 's @entity368 men 's basketball tournament			2
the governors of @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 and @entity373 have announced bans on certain state - funded travel to @entity159			2
mayors of @entity378 , @entity379 and @entity380 have followed suit for city - funded travel			0
those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include @entity1			0
@entity118 , the @entity116 press secretary , said tuesday that the @entity159 law ' flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support			0
' the @entity116 did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the @entity1 bill would be equally offensive to the @entity58 administration .			0

' my son @entity23 , signed the petition asking me , @entity26 , the governor , to veto this bill , ' @entity0 gov. @entity0 said wednesday
@entity23 told @entity34 that ' i love and respect my father very much , but sometimes we have political disagreements '
he 's sending the ' @entity13 ' back to the state legislature because it strays too far from the federal law that *inspired* it
@entity0 does n't risk a veto - override from lawmakers since he has n't *technically* vetoed the bill
' this is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial , but these are not ordinary times , ' he said
