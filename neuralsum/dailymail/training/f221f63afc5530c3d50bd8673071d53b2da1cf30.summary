@entity1 @entity0 are urging president @entity2 to hold off on an immigration announcement until after @entity4 passes legislation to fund the government through next year			1
members of the @entity9 caucus in upper chamber are worried that imminent action by the president will provoke @entity13 and derail debate on a critical spending bill , which must be enacted by dec. 11 to avoid a government shut down			1
democrats in the @entity18 , on the other hand , are pressing @entity2 to act without further delay , after having put an executive order protecting millions of illegal immigration on the back burner for several months already until after this month 's midterm elections			1
the @entity18 had not given any indication of when the president will go public with his plans other than to say that it will be sometime this year , again refusing to discuss the topic today			1
a 10 - point plan leaked last week by @entity31 revealed that he may do it as soon as this friday , however			2
@entity0 want the president to wait until @entity4 has passed a spending bill that will keep the government 's doors open through next year , while hardcore immigration advocates want him to act before the @entity44 holiday it also detailed immigrant populations the president should consider shielding from removal proceedings , including parents of citizen children and illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity51 as children , defined as age 16 and under , before 2010			1
all told , up to five million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the @entity51 indefinitely under @entity2 's executive order if he takes the actions outlined			1
the impending declaration sent shudders through @entity4 , and senate majority leader @entity59 told @entity60 it would be his preference for @entity2 to wait until after the government 's fiscal house was in order			1
' the president has said he ’s going to do the executive action			0
it ’s up to him , ' @entity59 said			0
' but i ’d like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it			0
' @entity59 has since backtracked , however , saying monday night that ' it should be done now			0
' sen. @entity75 of @entity76 told @entity77 on monday that he would like to see @entity2 postpone his adjustments to the immigration system even beyond the end of the legislative session			2
' if i were the president , what i ’d say to the @entity4 — @entity18 , @entity1 , @entity84 or @entity13 — i ’m going to give you a little bit of time and in the new @entity4 expect you to do something , ' @entity75 said			1
rather than making vague threats to @entity4 about the costs of inaction , @entity75 told the @entity92 should set in stone a date for @entity13 in the legislative branch to come to the table with their own reforms			2
if they do n't meet it , he said , then @entity2 should proceed			0
' i would say not the first month , maybe the first quarter ' of the new @entity4 , he said			0
the notion of continued inaction is unacceptable to influential immigration groups and their partners in the @entity18 , however			2
' waiting does n’t make sense , ' @entity104 , a principal at the @entity105 , told @entity77			0
' this is about millions of @entity51 families who ’ve been waiting for a very long time for something to be done , ' she said			0
@entity18 minority whip @entity111 , center , speaks alongside @entity51 military veterans , service members and immigration reform advocates , during a nov. 12 press conference at the @entity51 @entity117 urging @entity2 to move forward with immigration reform as soon as possible at a press conference last week that brought together immigration reform advocates and members of @entity4 , @entity123 rep. @entity111 said , ' what the president needs to do is give immediate and significant relief to those families that are going to be wrenched apart and living in fear			1
' ' i will be proud to support the president of the @entity51 in acting in a big , bold manner , ' he announced			0
@entity134 rep. @entity133 also said the president needs to make a ' bold ' and ' generous ' statement in the coming days , especially with the holiday season just around the corner			0
' i 've always said that the blessings of @entity44 should be bountiful this year for millions of immigrants that have been waiting for the @entity4 to act , ' @entity133 said last thursday on @entity141			2
on monday he implied that he may have insight into the president 's plans , telling the cable network that he knows for a fact that the forthcoming proclamation is ' going to be big			2
' ' i do n't want to say more than that			0
i 've been , as you know , we 've spoken before			0
i said it was going to be at least five million before			0
and it seems that that 's going to be a number that we 're looking at , ' he told host @entity157			0
' look , i can not tell you any more than that			0
' @entity18 press secretary @entity161 would not confirm on tuesday if the president had even received the @entity164 's recommendations yet , let alone the existence of a detailed plan			2
@entity161 also said the president did n't have very much time to work on the issue while he was in @entity170 last week but he plans to study it this week now that he is back in @entity172			2
he did concede that the @entity18 had weighed the pros and cons of waiting until after the spending fight , and said , ' i think the fact is you could provably argue this both ways			0
' the @entity2 spokesman said @entity13 are ' well aware ' that the president is going to act and his ' sense ' therefore is that they will try to preemptively pass legislation trying to stop him , which @entity161 said was ' unwarranted			1
' @entity18 press secretary @entity161 refused to shed light today on @entity2 's anticipated immigration plans			1
he did however confirm that the @entity18 was debating whether or not to wait until after the spending fight had concluded if @entity13 would just pass comprehensive immigration reform , he argued , the president could ' throw away ' and planned executive actions			1
house speaker @entity192 has stated time and time again that he will not bring the bill passed in the @entity1 more than a year ago , to the floor of the @entity18			2
he instead prefers to tackle problems with the immigration system one by one			0
in anticipation of the @entity2 's executive action , @entity13 in the @entity18 and @entity1 have indeed focused their immigration efforts on schemes to block @entity2 through the legislative process			1
among those , according to @entity204 , is a plan to bring an immigration bill to the floor next year , when the @entity13 has a larger share of seats in both chambers , that would enhance border security while requiring @entity2 to enforce existing immigration laws			1
another pathway under consideration is passage a short term continuing resolution that would fund the government through the first quarter of next year until @entity13 officially hold a majority of seats in @entity4			1
the @entity18 may also decide to fund every department of the government through the end of fiscal year 2015 except the @entity164 , which it would give short - term funding to as a stop gap until newly elected republicans are seated			1
conservatives in the @entity18 and @entity1 favor a measure that fund the government while explicitly stating that @entity2 can not use any of the money appropriated through it to support activities associated with his executive order , which would essentially freeze @entity164 ' ability to implement it			1
@entity192 said thursday at a press conference that ' all options on the table , ' however @entity18 @entity13 have since clarified that a government shut down is off limits			1
as sen. @entity241 pointed out on monday evening on @entity242 , however , using the spending bill as a vehicle to outmaneuver @entity2 has its limitations			0
even if @entity13 recruited enough of their @entity9 colleagues in the @entity1 to pass a bill tying the president 's hands on immigration will land itself at the top of @entity2 's veto list			1
taking @entity2 to court may be @entity13 ' only realistic avenue to stop him from authorizing his own rules in the next two years before he leaves office			2
' i think with regard to immigration reform , he ’s doing something that @entity4 has not instructed him to do and in fact has instructed him otherwise , so i think the @entity264 would strike it down , ' @entity241 stated			0
' that takes a while , but that may be the only recourse short of a new president			0
