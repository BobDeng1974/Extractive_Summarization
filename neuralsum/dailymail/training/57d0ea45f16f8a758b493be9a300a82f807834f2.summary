by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 06:14 est , 11 october 2013 postmen often have to keep an eye out for aggressive dogs while trying to make their deliveries			0
but rather than a hound , it was a large spider that stopped letters being delivered to the home of @entity10			1
instead of a cheque the business analyst was waiting for , he found a note written by a scared postman which read : ' no access - massive spider web in front gate '			1
failed delivery : mr @entity20 eventually received his letter when it was delivered by the postman 's colleague - who had written ' what ! ' on the post according to mr @entity26 the ' massive spider ' was the size of a 10p coin			1
the 42 - year - old said he had noticed the animal by the side of his front gate - but had left it be to avoid breaking the web			1
mr @entity10 said : ' i could n't believe it			0
he was either spider - friendly and did n't want to break the web or a terrified arachnophobe			1
' after a night away , @entity10 found his mail had been delivered to his home in @entity42 , @entity43 , by another , less scared , postman			1
fear : the business analyst said the spider , which spun its web on the front gate of his @entity42 home , pictured , was no bigger than a 10p coin rather comically , the braver postman had added his own comment to his colleague 's note which said : ' what ! ' today , @entity56 apologised for any inconvenience mr @entity26 had suffered and added : ' alternative arrangements should have been made			1
' an expert has confirmed that this arachnid is a common garden spider - and not one of thousands of poisonous spiders currently plaguing @entity64			1
@entity65 of @entity66 said : ' this is a common garden spider , @entity68			2
' [ they are ] common and widespread			0
very noticeable this time of year as the large females are at their biggest and sitting in the middle of their webs			2
' the postman is not the first - and probably wo n't be the last - to refuse to make a delivery			2
@entity76 , 63 , did not receive regular mail deliveries for months because pigeon droppings made it too slippery for postal staff to deliver to her home			0
the animals would gather on top of a wall close to her @entity86 home and regularly splatter the path with droppings			0
apology : @entity56 have today said that alternative arrangements should have been made so that mr @entity10 's letter was delivered regardless of the spider , pictured at the time , a @entity56 spokesman said : ' we suspended delivery to two addresses in october 2012 , because the postman delivering there reported broken glass and a slippery , slimy surface on the path in the narrow alleyway			1
' we informed the customers of the suspension and told them we would be contacting the local authority to request cleaning work be carried out in the alleyway			0
' in february , residents of 90 homes in @entity111 were sent a letter warning them their post has been temporarily suspended for health and safety reasons after two postmen were confronted by one dog			2
mr @entity10 is not the first to experience a late delivery			0
@entity76 , 63 , did not receive regular mail deliveries for a month because pigeon droppings made it too slippery for postal staff to reach her home in @entity86			0
once the mess was cleared three weeks later , the service resumed			0
overzealous @entity56 health and safety officers ruled in november last year that the uneven paving slabs on two roads in @entity129 , @entity130 , were too dangerous for their postmen to negotiate			2
the residents had to make a six - mile round trip to a local delivery office to collect their post - and were told to speak to the @entity135 about the issue			1
@entity56 suspended deliveries to one street in @entity139 , northern @entity140 , after a flock of unfriendly seagulls launched a series of ' swooping attacks ' on one postman			0
the organisation said at the time they would resume their service ' as soon as it was safe to do so			0
' around 90 residents of a @entity111 , @entity152 , estate were sent a letter by @entity56 warning them their post had been suspended temporarily because of an aggressive dog .			2

rather than a cheque he was expecting , @entity157 found a note which read : ' no access - massive spider web in front gate '
42 - year - old from @entity42 , @entity43 , said spider was same size as 10p coin
@entity169 's colleague later delivered the post - writing on the letter ' what ! '
