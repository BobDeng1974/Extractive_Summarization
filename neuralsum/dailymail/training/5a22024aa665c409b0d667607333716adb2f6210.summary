by @entity0 published : 05:44 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 03:09 est , 1 august 2012 the @entity2 promotional leaflet which used a photo of the @entity4 to promote @entity6 food in an attempt to promote its stores @entity6 , @entity2 decided that a picture of the rolling countryside would help show its commitment to locally sourced produce			1
but there may be some questioning its ' local ' credentials after it emerged the idyllic scene of green hills , dry - stone walls and blue water was actually from the @entity4 - 300 miles away in @entity20			1
the supermarket has admitted using the image to promote its flagship @entity24 store			2
the picture , which was actually taken in @entity26 , near @entity27 in @entity28 , featured in a six - page brochure given away to households near the chain ’s new £ 27million store			1
@entity34 businessman @entity33 , who spotted the embarrassing error , said : ' i recognised the house in the picture because friends of mine lived there			1
' i was surprised to see it but i find it funny rather than anything else			0
' @entity4 spokesman @entity43 agreed : ' it looks like @entity26 to me , on the way up to @entity46			1
' an @entity2 spokesman admitted the company made an error and apologised			0
she said the image was a stock photo and added : we hold our hands up and apologise for this silly mistake – we should n’t have used a generic image			2
blooper : the picture shown here is actually of @entity26 in the @entity4 , @entity20 that is 300 miles away ' we could n’t be more proud of our @entity6 colleagues and the hundreds of local companies that supply thousands of products to our stores across the country			1
' ' we should focus on the fact that we are working with local suppliers and we are not coming in being all talk and no trousers - we are walking the walk			2
' it 's another humiliating moment for the supermarket , which has been fiercely attacked for its part in the milk scandal which saw dairy farmers protesting that they were not being paid enough to cover their costs			0
only one minor detail spoilt the scene - the photograph was actually taken in the very @entity4 dairy farmers were furious about cuts of up to 2p a litre in the amount they receive from major milk processors and many feared the shortfall will force them out of business			1
@entity2 , @entity86 and the co-operative caved in to pressure and announced they would increase the prices they paid to suppliers			0
all raised their fees , which will be passed on to the dairy producers			0
a litre of milk costs at least 30p to produce , but many dairy farmers say they are being paid as little as 24p			2
most are locked into 12 - month contracts so can not try to get better prices elsewhere			0
in july @entity2 raised payments to 27.5p a litre , while @entity86 put its payments up to 31p a litre			0
the @entity104 increased its fee to 29p per litre .			0

picture advertising local produce is actually of @entity26 , in the @entity4
@entity109 says ' they never said photo was of @entity6 '
