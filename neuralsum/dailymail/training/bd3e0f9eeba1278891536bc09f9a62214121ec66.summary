the pressures of modern relationships means more and more couples are in committed relationships but do n't share a home , new research has revealed today			1
one in ten adults in @entity7 are in a relationship but not living with their partner – a phenomenon known as ' @entity12 ' ( @entity12 ) - and most of those are incorrectly counted as single in official statistics			1
the study , by @entity18 , the @entity19 and @entity20 , encompassed the nine per cent of @entity7 adults who , although they are in a steady relationship , do not live with their partner			0
shared solitude : although younger couples are more likely to be @entity26 , there are a surprising number of older couples who live apart there is a common assumption that people who choose not to live with their partner are either wealthy celebrity couples – such as @entity32 and @entity33 – or are professional couples forced to live apart because of their jobs , say the authors			1
in fact , @entity26 come from all sections of @entity7 society and from all parts of the country , and only eight per cent live apart primarily because of where their jobs are , according to the study			1
director @entity33 and actress @entity32 famously live apart professor @entity43 , from @entity45 ’s @entity44 , said : ' nowadays very few people settle into a life - long relationship in their early twenties and stay with their partner “ until death us do part ”			0
' people have complex relationship histories , and they often carry with them the emotional legacies of divorce and separation			0
' for some people , more or less consciously , living apart together is a way of dealing with the messiness of intimate life today , protecting themselves , their children and their homes from some of the distress that they have previously experienced when a cohabiting relationship breaks down			0
' that said , most people in @entity12 relationships have a strong sense that they are a couple , and many are in long - term relationships to which they are deeply committed			1
' although the majority of @entity26 are under 35 , 11 per cent are 55 or over			1
around two - thirds of @entity26 live within 10 miles of each other and the vast majority ( 86 per cent ) are in daily contact			2
the researchers found that around a third of @entity26 live apart because they feel they are not yet ready to live together , although many hope to do so in the future			2
a further third choose to live apart – however , few of these see this as a lifestyle choice , rather living apart is seen as emotionally safer , or a better way to manage other commitments , such as those to children , family and friends , or work			1
one woman surveyed called @entity93 said : ' i do n’t want to rush into it because my son suffers from @entity97 , and he does n’t deal with change very well			0
i just want to take it , each day at a time			0
' i ’m not saying it [ cohabitation ] will never happen			0
' i do hope it does happen			0
' while being in the early stages of a relationship is a major reason for living apart , nearly as many couples simply prefer the arrangement the remaining third are not able to live together due to circumstances outside the relationship itself – including financial reasons or working or studying in different places			2
another participant called @entity115 said : ' we ’re like a little team and when we ’ve got decisions to make we ’ll make them together			0
' and if i ’m having a good day i think , “ oh i ’ll ring him and tell him ” , if i ’m having a bad day then i ’ll ring him and sob down the phone			0
' only a tiny minority of couples - just one per cent – say the main reason they live apart is to maintain benefit entitlements			2
choice : while work , children from previous relationships and other factors may force a couple not to live together , some just like the freedom it offers them one respondee , called @entity137 , was brutally honest , saying : ' as a bloke ... it 's quite a good situation , because i can do what i want ... and have the best of both worlds			1
' although the study shows that couples who live apart are a sizeable minority , they are currently ignored by the @entity147 and most other social surveys on which the design of public services are based			2
professor @entity43 added : ' we would like to see @entity12 couples have the right to " opt in " to legal recognition – for protection in case of separation or bereavement – and to be taken into account by those providing personal , health and social care services , such as relationship counselling and family support			1

a large percentage of couples are ' @entity12 '
*complexities* of modern relationships is one reason behind trend
some have work *constraints* but many are @entity26 as a lifestyle choice
