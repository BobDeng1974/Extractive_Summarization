by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 14:04 est , 31 october 2013 parts of @entity2 are to be lashed by torrential downpours this weekend as almost half a month 's worth of rain is expected to fall in just one day			2
the @entity6 has given an severe weather warning for tomorrow and saturday in the south of @entity9 , where some areas are to expect more than an inch and a half of rain			1
forecasters predicted that 1.57ins of rain could fall in southern counties including @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 - just short of half the average expected rainfall for november , which is 3.46ins			1
downpours : this forecast shows the heavy rain in the south of @entity9 , expected to fall mostly on friday dusk : the sun sets last night over the @entity31 in west @entity22			0
there have been warnings of heavy rain in the area for tomorrow scenic : @entity38 's lighthouse in @entity39 , near @entity40 , was pictured last night			1
the north of the country will escape the worst of the wet weather people on a bleak and deserted @entity46 today			2
the country is bracing itself for two weeks worth of rain weather experts also warned of small - scale flooding and disruption to transport services			1
@entity53 , a forecaster at the @entity6 , said : ' we 've put out a warning for southern @entity9 , particularly towards the south coastal counties - from @entity19 eastwards across those southern counties of @entity9			1
' we 're talking about 0.6ins to 1.2ins quite widely , with as much as 1.6inches in some places - though we would n't expect this to be widespread			1
' the torrents , which have the potential to bring with them gales of up to 60mph in coastal areas , could make for choppy conditions on the @entity68			0
warnings : this map from the @entity6 shows the areas which will be most severely affected by the rain tomorrow and saturday @entity74 flood warnings have also been issued by the @entity75 in light of the expected rain			1
a spokesman said : ' there is a medium likelihood of river and surface water flooding in parts of south and southeast @entity9 on friday			0
' typical disruption could include localised minor flooding of land and roads and also localised travel disruption			0
' in contrast to the downfall to come , the weather today will be only slightly unsettled across the country , with a mixture of rain and sun. a @entity6 forecast said : ' today , in the southeast corner of @entity9 we 've got some fairly patchy rain , which will gradually clear in the course of the day ,			1
taking until mid-afternoon to clear in the very far southeast			0
' to the northwest of @entity104 in particular there are blustery showers , with the potential for thunderstorms			0
' in the rest of @entity9 , @entity110 and @entity111 there are sunny spells with some blustery showers			0
' into tomorrow we start to see this weather system pushing up into the south , which we have the alert for			1
that will probably give rainfall across a good portion of @entity9 and @entity110 , but it 's really the southern counties that are expected to bear the brunt of the heavier rain			2
destruction : @entity127 's storm pulled down this two - storey scaffolding in @entity129 , east @entity22 , crushing cars and blocking 100m of road powerless : monday 's storm pulled down electricity lines , including the one pictured in @entity134 , @entity17 , leaving thousands of homes without power people watch the waves batter into the sea wall of a marina in @entity141 , south @entity9 on monday ' to the north of that , still blustery showers to northwest @entity104 , but northern @entity111 , southern @entity104 and north - west @entity9 should see a fairly decent day			0
' and then into the weekend the system that 's bringing tomorrow 's rainfall moves away out into the @entity147 , but we have another one pushing in from the @entity150 for saturday			1
' it 's looking like a decent start for saturday in much of the @entity2 , and eastern areas will hold on to fine weather for most of daylight hours			2
' but there will be some wet and windy weather from the west on saturday - probably in showers rather than persistent rain			1
expect quite windy conditions in the west , and probably the south - west			0
the continued wetness will come as an unwelcome follow - up to @entity127 's storm earlier this week , which tore a trail of destruction across the country which left as many as five people dead , and thousands of homes without power			0
some homes in the south and south - east of @entity9 - which can expect the majority of the weekend 's wet weather - are still without power in the aftermath of the storm , which left almost a quarter of a million homes cut off			2
according to @entity182 , which maintains power supplies in the south and south - east of @entity9 , this morning all but 4,000 homes have been reconnected			0
around 1,000 properties in @entity17 , 2,000 in @entity186 , and a several hundred in other eastern counties are yet to have their electricity restored .			0
