@entity1 , 36 , walked into @entity4 unchecked just three months after he was released from a ten - year jail term			1
weeks later , he travelled to @entity3 where he dragged a woman off the street and violently assaulted her			1
a court heard @entity1 throttled the 31 - year - old so hard she passed out before dragging her to a wooded area nearby where he raped her			2
charities and politicians reacted with outrage after it emerged he could be freed on parole in a little over three years			0
and they demanded to know why @entity1 was admitted into the country in the first place			2
@entity27 mp @entity26 urged attorney general @entity28 to review the length of @entity1 ’s sentence			2
he said : ‘ i ’m not sure how the sentence length of this evil man ’s second identical crime can be shorter than his first			0
he is obviously pathologically dangerous			0
’ @entity34 , who runs the @entity3 branch of charity @entity36 , said : ‘ the fact a man who was convicted of rape in his own country was allowed to come over to ours so easily and commit the very same crime is something which is of grave concern to us			1
’ the court heard @entity1 was drinking cider in @entity3 town centre when he spotted the woman walking nearby			1
@entity50 , prosecuting , said the woman avoided eye contact with him and tried to walk away , but he approached her from behind , grabbed her around the throat and began to squeeze			0
mr @entity55 said : ‘ the woman tried to get away , but he was too strong			0
she shouted for help but her calls went unheeded			0
’ @entity1 then pressed harder on the woman ’s windpipe until she lost consciousness and dragged her to bushes nearby			1

@entity1 , who has a string of previous convictions in @entity5 , including rape , burglary and drugs , pleaded guilty to rape and grievous bodily harm last month			1
but at @entity80 on thursday judge @entity94 sentenced him to just seven years in jail – after giving him a five - year discount for his early guilty plea			1
he will be eligible to apply for parole at the half way point , and , if turned down , will automatically be released two - thirds of the way through that term			0
as @entity1 has already served four months on remand , it means he could be paroled just over three years into his sentence			1

last night it remained unclear if the @entity5 had complied with that undertaking or not			0
