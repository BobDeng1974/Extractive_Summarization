a top @entity1 official improperly used his influence to help @entity3 – @entity5 's youngest brother – with visas for his company 's foreign investors , according to a new inspector general report			1
investigators said @entity11 helped efforts to secure the visas in ways that created the appearance of favoritism and special access			2
he also helped @entity20 gov. @entity19 's green - car venture in ' unprecedented ' fashion , according to the inspector general , and a casino company whose success was a pet project of then - senate majority leader @entity26			0
@entity11 was at the time in charge of @entity28			1
mrs. @entity5 's latest ' brother eruption ' could complicate her quest for the @entity31			1
@entity5 's brother , @entity3 ( left ) benefited from the improper influence of a top @entity1 official who intervened to help his clients get special visas for their overseas investors , according to a new inspector general report @entity11 , now the no. 2 official at @entity1 , headed @entity28 when @entity3 approached him for ' unprecedented ' help ' brother eruption ' : @entity5 's older brother @entity42 ( right ) made unwelcome news at the end of president @entity46 's tenure by successfully lobbying him to commute the federal drug - dealing prison sentence of a @entity51 donor 's son			1
trouble : @entity5 is poised for a presidential run and her brothers ' histories could come back to haunt her when she was first lady , a series of embarrassing episodes including both @entity3 and @entity58 led @entity31 staffers to refer to them with an eye - roll as ' the brothers @entity3			1
' @entity5 's older brother @entity42 made unwelcome news at the end of president @entity46 's tenure by successfully lobbying him to commute the federal drug - dealing prison sentence of a @entity51 donor 's son			1
@entity42 had been paid $ 400,000 by the donor to lobby for that outcome			0
he later returned the money as a scandal grew			0
at the time , @entity11 – already a @entity3 friend – intervened and spoke to the @entity31 about the request , something he conceded during his 2009 @entity72 confirmation hearing was a mistake			1
@entity5 , then a freshman @entity75 senator from @entity76 , distanced herself from her brother in a press conference			2
' i did not know my brother was involved in any way in any of this , ' she said at the time			0
' i did not have any involvement in the pardons that were granted or not granted , and i 'm just very disappointed about my brother 's involvement			2
' separately , @entity3 had his own brush with presidential pardon embarrassment , successfully pressing president @entity46 to pardon a @entity91 couple convicted of bank fraud			1
@entity46 overruled objections from the @entity94 in granting that request			0
@entity3 claimed he received no money in exchange for his access to the @entity99 , but the @entity100 later found that he was paid as a consultant			2
more recently , a book due out in may describes a scheme involving an alleged sweetheart deal @entity3 benefited from in @entity105			2
he was a board member of a @entity107 mining company that enjoyed prime access to @entity105 gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by @entity46			0
that work was conducted through the @entity114 , a philanthropy that now bears @entity5 's name			1
@entity20 's @entity51 governor @entity19 ( right ) , shown with prince @entity117 and @entity118 , senior vice president for @entity119 at @entity120 , got special favors for his green - technology firm the latest @entity3 embarrassment , revealed tuesday , involves influential @entity51 who sought help from @entity3 with securing visas as part of a complicated foreign investor program			1
the @entity75 government 's investor - visa program , known as @entity131 , allows foreigners to obtain visas to live permanently in the @entity75 with their spouses and children if they invest $ 500,000 to $ 1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for @entity75 citizens			2
@entity140 , @entity75 secretary of @entity1 , said @entity11 is ' exceptionally conscientious , honest and patriotic ' – despite his link to the latest scandal approved investors can become legal permanent residents after two years and later can become @entity75 citizens			1
@entity3 ran @entity146 , a firm that specialized in recruiting foreign investors and securing their @entity131 - 5 visas			1
@entity149 , run by now - @entity20 gov. @entity19 – who was @entity46 's top fundraiser in the 1990s – contracted with @entity152			1
homeland security inspector general @entity153 wrote that he did n't know why @entity11 intervened in the cases , and did n't accuse him of violating any laws			1
but he criticized the long - time @entity51 legal eagle for using his influence improperly			0
@entity153 also praised as ' courageous ' the agency employees who confidentially had complained about @entity11 ' actions and promised they would be protected as whistleblowers			0
@entity11 said in a statement that he disagreed with @entity153 's findings but added that ' i will certainly learn from it and from this process			2
' he added : ' there was erroneous decision - making and insufficient security vetting of cases			0
i could not and did not turn my back on my responsibility to address those grave problems			0
i made improving the program a priority and i did so in a hands - on manner			0
' the chairman of the @entity179 , @entity180 @entity178 rep. @entity178 , said the findings were ' extremely concerning ' and that he will conduct a congressional hearing about them thursday			0
@entity153 was expected to testify			0
@entity5 's brothers @entity58 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) have been intermittent sources of embarrassment since her days ad first lady during the 1990s @entity188 @entity187 , a casino that opened late last year , benefited from undue influence in securing foreign investors with the promise of visas that could lead to @entity75 citizenship the @entity31 praised @entity11 on wednesday when asked about the brewing scandal , saying he still works at @entity1 ' because he is a decorated public servant and an effective leader of that organization			1
' press secretary @entity199 said the president and his advisers ' certainly value the kind of contribution that he has made to the effective management of that department , and he has played an important role in implementing needed reforms in that department			1
' in fact , @entity199 told @entity211 ' @entity210 , @entity11 is ' leading the effort ' to implement reforms in the department in question and ' strengthen ' the eb - 5 program			1
after @entity210 expressed shock at @entity31 's full - throated support in the @entity1 official who ' basically gave special visas and access to politically - connected @entity51 , ' @entity199 said , ' to be clear , @entity210 , the inspector general , who , as you point out , did take a close and independent look at this , did not suggest that these individuals were n’t deserving of a visa			1
' ' what he suggested is merely that the process did n’t work very well , ' @entity228 's spokesman said			0
' these are exactly the problems that deputy secretary @entity11 was trying to address , and there are additional reforms that are needed , and there will be additional reforms that are implemented			1
' refusing to let @entity199 off the hook , @entity210 asked if @entity11 was trying to make reforms when he let @entity5 's brother ' jump to the front of the line			1
' ' that 's not the accusation , @entity210 , ' the @entity31 spokesman fired back			2
' go back to the inspector general report - that is not what it said , ' a visibly agitated @entity199 told him			0
the inspector general 's new conclusions also cast doubt on whether the @entity1 withheld embarrassing internal files the @entity254 had sought under the @entity75 @entity255 as part of its own investigation nearly two years ago – and instead released records that indicated no wrongdoing			1
the @entity254 in july 2013 requested all emails to or from @entity11 over the preceding seven months that contained specific words or names , including @entity263			0
the government eventually sent @entity254 more than 200 pages , mostly censored , including emails in which @entity11 told investors and agency staff that he would not become involved in internal deliberations			1
' i can not weigh in , ' @entity11 wrote to assistant secretary @entity271 on feb. 1 , 2013 , in a message turned over to the @entity254 and cited in the new inspector general 's report			2
' the ( investor 's ) attorney sent an email to me and i responded that i could not weigh in			0
' but the inspector general 's report also cited other messages from @entity11 that were never turned over to the @entity254			2
in one case , @entity11 forwarded a january 2013 email from @entity263 about delays with a high importance designation			0
the email would have been covered under @entity254 's information request since @entity11 sent it during the relevant time period and contained @entity3 's name			1
' @entity288 understood these applications were getting high - level attention , ' the inspector general 's report said			2
@entity20 gov. @entity19 , another @entity291 , was also connected to the investor proposal but later divested			0
his spokesman , @entity293 , said the report demonstrated that @entity19 asked the government to decide on the investment proposal in a timely fashion			0
the other two cases involved a @entity300 investment program and an investment effort in @entity302 that had ties to former @entity305 gov. @entity304 and @entity306 @entity26 of @entity302 , respectively			0
the @entity26 - related project was @entity188 , a casino project that he did n't invest in but advocated strongly for as @entity302 's senior senator			0
homeland security secretary @entity140 said there were lessons to be learned in the inspector general 's investigation but described @entity11 in a statement as ' exceptionally conscientious , honest and patriotic			2
' ' he is often impatient with our sluggish government bureaucracy , can at times be very hands - on in resolving issues and problems that are brought to his personal attention , and is always mindful that we are public servants , ' @entity140 said			0
' @entity322 works hard to do the right thing , and never acts , in my observation , for reasons of personal advancement or aggrandizement			0
