police are investigating claims that @entity2 , pictured , was in a gang of sex attackers @entity2 died in his dressing room at the @entity6 in @entity7 where he was starring in @entity9 ’s black comedy loot			1
the squash - playing , keep - fit enthusiast had a heart attack that was sudden and unexpected			1
a unique aspect of the tributes to the much - loved actor and tv sitcom star was the paucity of wicked anecdotes about him			1
there were none of those villainous tales that are normally whispered back - stage about major stars			1
as his biographer @entity25 observes , @entity2 approached acting ‘ as a job , as solid and practical as book - keeping or car mechanics ’			1
now , 30 years after the actor ’s death in 1984 at the age of just 57 , an anecdote of unique wickedness has finally emerged			1
what ’s more , it is as potentially destructive to the memory of the star of tv ’s @entity38 and @entity40 as an unexploded bomb discovered under the floorboards — and just as distressing to his 87 - year - old widow @entity43			1
in the continuing fall - out of the sordid @entity48 affair , a 66 - year - old fellow actor is alleging that in 1968 , when he was 18 and working as an extra on a @entity50 drama in which @entity2 was starring , he was sexually abused twice while an ‘ excited ’ @entity2 watched			1
they were making the ground - breaking sci - fi story @entity53			1
it depicted a dystopian world in which the media is controlled by an elite few who keep the masses docile by pumping out pornography and reality - tv shows			1
as part of the plot , the young actor — as well as a girl extra , also allegedly attacked — was covered in gold paint			1
he claims that he endured two rape attempts by three men in a rehearsal room , and was shouting for help as @entity2 looked on			1
‘ he obviously found it a big turn - on , ’ he has claimed			1
‘ he was watching with glee			1
’ the claim is being investigated by police officers from @entity75 who are working their way through hundreds of @entity78 allegations of historic abuse by @entity50 stars			1
some famous names have been jailed , but there has been only mixed success in obtaining convictions			1
in the case of @entity2 — an allegation that dates back 46 years — they will interview up to ten former @entity50 staff involved in the drama ’s production			1
unsurprisingly , friends of the family are appalled that three decades after his death , attempts are being made to bring about what one describes as ‘ the rise and fall of @entity2 ’			1
messages of support and goodwill have been pouring into the little terraced house near @entity102 ’s football ground in @entity103 , southwest @entity7 , into which @entity2 and @entity43 ( his second wife ) moved just two years before his death , and where she — also an actress — still lives			1
‘ it ’s terrible for @entity43 to have to go through all this when @entity109 is n’t here to defend himself , ’ declares one friend of the family			1
‘ it ’s hardly justice			1
’ one of the complainants claimed the abuse occurred on the set of a drama , which was filmed at @entity118 , pictured , in 1968 inevitably , that includes the couple ’s only child , @entity120 , 41 , who is married and lives in @entity122 , @entity123 , and is a stalwart protector of her father ’s memory			1
‘ @entity120 is very angry , ’ says one close figure			1
‘ her dad ’s memory means everything to her			2
she can hardly believe that anyone can even think he behaved like that			2
he was n’t a pop star or a disc jockey , but a serious actor , for goodness sake			1
’ the family ethic was certainly important to @entity140 - born @entity2 , who began his working life as an insurance clerk			2
his father , a barber and illicit bookie , was killed by a bomb during the @entity146 while on duty as a volunteer ambulance driver , and young @entity109 ’s pay helped out his widowed mother			2
but he reached a point where , he said , he was ‘ bored out of my mind ’ with the insurance business and chucked it in to become an actor			1
ever a perfectionist , he took elocution lessons which resulted in the clear and concise voice that made his characters so real			2
outside acting , his passions were his family , good wine , sport ( as a boy he was a spin bowler for @entity165 @entity164 ) , @entity166 and playing chess against an electronic machine			2
but as a star , he lived a quiet life , finding fame ‘ a bit tiring ’			2
the reason was he could never avoid people identifying him with his roles and calling out to him in the street			2
he had created two of the finest tv characters of the times , and the public recognised him as @entity38 , the lecherous , snivelling landlord of @entity38 , and as @entity182 , the disillusioned executive who fakes his own death and returns in disguise to take up his old job			2
people also loved the smugly self - satisfied bore he played in those memorable @entity189 advertisements , soaking @entity190 on a passenger jet			2
@entity192 wept bitterly at his death			2
‘ he was such a wonderful man , ’ she said			2
the incidents of alleged abuse in 1968 predated his fame by several years , although he was already a character actor , having not been born with conventional , leading - man good looks			1
but women found his energy and humour very attractive – in his early acting years one of his conquests was a young @entity206			2
he met his first wife , the actress @entity207 — best known as @entity209 ’s long - suffering neighbour in @entity210 — while both worked at @entity212 their 1959 marriage lasted a mere three years , ms @entity207 lamenting that in their brief time together ‘ @entity109 was always going off with other women and being uncaring ’			2
he married @entity43 in 1964 , and apart from describing their marriage as ‘ up and down ’ — in other words , fairly normal — she has shed no light on any problems they may have had in their private life , certainly not his weakness for other women			0
if @entity2 was indulging in extra-marital activities , they were carried on with remarkable care and discretion on both sides			0
certainly , the acting world was never buzzing with any gossip			0
as for his years at the @entity50 , the only gossip was about him being professionally ‘ driven ’ , a demanding ‘ monster ’ and a ‘ tetchy perfectionist ’			1
but in 2002 , 18 years after his death , a letter fell on to his widow @entity43 ’s doormat , the contents of which were every bit as shocking , say friends , as the allegations now being made against her late husband			0
the writer of the letter was @entity249 , the @entity250 presenter whose measured voice and unflappable professionalism have been familiar to listeners ( particularly during her years on the today programme ) across middle - @entity255 for getting on for half a century			0
her reason for writing was that she had written her autobiography , and she felt she had to warn @entity43 that she intended to describe ( in some detail , as it turned out ) her secret affair with @entity2 that had gone on for five years until his death			0
it transpired that at the height of his fame , in 1979 , she had interviewed him on @entity250 ’s @entity266			0
the next day he phoned and suggested they meet for a drink			0
‘ i was intrigued , ’ wrote @entity269 in her book			0
‘ could this be simply a postscript to our meeting of the day before			0
or was he interested in something more ? ’ this was the beginning of an extraordinarily clandestine affair , their meetings always taking place at @entity269 ’s @entity283 apartment			0
being instantly recognisable , whenever he climbed the steps to her front door , @entity2 covered his face with a white handkerchief as though he was blowing his nose			0
as for @entity269 , she said she wondered what her neighbours were making of this gentleman caller who always seemed to have a cold			0
it was a regular , farcical scene that might have come straight out of a @entity2 sitcom , but this was serious			0
@entity269 , then aged 37 to his 52 , found him ‘ quick , clever , funny and an enthusiastic bon viveur			0
i found him immensely attractive ’			0
from the start , however , he had made it plain he would never leave @entity43			0
meanwhile , @entity269 , as with her close relationship with television inquisitor sir @entity303 , assured him she was ‘ a determinedly single soul ’ — as she still is today at the age of 72			0
but she was in love with him , admitting : ‘ i did see other men from time to time but none of them seemed quite as attractive			0
’ for @entity269 , the secret visits were not enough , but , despite her tears , he could give no more			0
so she accepted the limitations			0
@entity2 continued to visit her once a week , right up to his death			0
‘ i ’m not proud of my relationship with @entity2 , ’ she said when promoting her memoir			0
‘ but i do n’t regret it , because i loved him			0
’ asked this week for a view on the allegations being made against @entity2 , @entity269 said : ‘ i ’m going to be really boring and say “ @entity319 ”			0
i had hoped that [ our affair ] had , by now — if i may use the expression — gone to bed			0
’ @entity43 has never commented on the broadcaster ’s revelations			0
and the couple ’s daughter , @entity120 , who , at the time was as ‘ horribly shocked ’ as her mother , has loyally dismissed the saga of her father ’s infidelity as something simply made up by @entity249 in order to sell her book			0
@entity120 remembers him as a devoted father who enjoyed playing games and taking her to the park , a man so worried by reports of crashes involving school buses that he refused to let her join a school coach trip to @entity345 but drove her there himself — and waited all day until it was time to bring her home			0
so what does she think about these abuse claims against her father ? ‘ when someone ’s dead , ’ she says , ‘ people can say what they like about them , ca n’t they ? and the person ca n’t say anything to defend themselves			1
