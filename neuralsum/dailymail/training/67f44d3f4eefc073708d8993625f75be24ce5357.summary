december was a rough month for @entity0 , as the movie studio was forced to sit back and watch as hackers released private emails from top executives , the personal information of thousands of company employees , and then threatened a terrorist attack on @entity9 movie theaters , all in an attempt to get the studio to cancel the long planned @entity13 release of their @entity15 assassination comedy @entity14			1
things finally turned around on wednesday however , when @entity13 came exactly one day early for @entity0 and the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing @entity14 online			1
making the release even sweeter for @entity0 was the massive outpouring of public support for the film , with thousands turning out for christmas eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of @entity9 streaming the film online			1
guests at the @entity32 theater 's midnight showing in @entity33 even got their own little holiday surprise when the film 's writers and directors , @entity38 and @entity39 , showed up to introduce the film and answer questions			0
' @entity59 ... i just watched the @entity14 and i laughed my butt off ! ! ! thanks @entity62 ! ! ' said one happy customer , while another said paying $ 5.99 to watch the film was ' totally worth it			0
' this in contrast to @entity69 critic @entity68 who said in his review of the film that ' @entity59 is right to object , ' before then going on to warn readers eager to see the film that ' an evening of cinematic waterboarding awaits			0
' also expressing their excitement over the comedy 's release on social media were stars @entity38 and @entity82 , who have frequently taken to @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 over the past two days to remind everyone how happy they are to see the film released , and , in @entity38 's case , suggest that fans check it out on the big screen			1
' i need to say that a comedy is best viewed in a theater full of people , so if you can , i 'd watch it like that			0
or call some friends over , ' he said just hours before his surprise appearance wednesday night			0
@entity82 decided to take a much different approach , as the actor continued his current social media strategy of really utilizing his keyboard 's caps lock and punctuation keys , writing on @entity84 ; ' @entity106 ! ! ! ! ! ! the interview is live ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! watch it here ! ! ! thank you @entity0 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ' there were also a few @entity9 flag emojis to really make the post pop. and as an added bonus for @entity0 , the studio will now go down in the history books for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online , as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms - theaters , online and video on demand			1
' it has always been @entity0 's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film , ' @entity125 chair and ceo @entity124 said in a statement			2
' we chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day , and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release			0
' even more impressive however is how quickly the studio managed to pull this all together after initially deciding to hold off on distributing the film last week			0
@entity0 only announced on tuesday that the film would play in selected theaters and be released to video on demand on thursday			2
as for the big online announcement , that was confirmed less than an hour before the movie appeared on @entity147 , @entity62 , @entity148 and a @entity0 website created for the film , with the option of renting the film for $ 5.99 or downloading it for $ 16.99			2
laughing and laughing : @entity82 and @entity38 ( above in a still from the film ) have also be using their social media accounts to share how happy they are to see the film be released and while many are not doubt eager to learn how many views , and how much dough , @entity0 will make off of online streaming , the studio has said at this time there is no plan to release the numbers , a move very similar to that practiced by @entity164			1
@entity0 also quickly learned the biggest downfall of an online release , as less than an hour after it was released , pirates had already copied and shared the film .			2

thousands packed movie theaters across the country last night for the first screening of @entity14 , which happened at midnight on @entity173
this as tens of thousands streamed the film online in just its first day of release
early audiences seem to be responding well to the film , sharing how much they enjoyed the comedy on social media
this news is not doubt a relief to everyone involved in the production and many at the studio after the film was panned by many critics
@entity0 also made history on wednesday when @entity14 became to first studio film to have its release online
they then made history again thursday , when @entity14 became the first film to simultaneously play across three different viewing platforms
