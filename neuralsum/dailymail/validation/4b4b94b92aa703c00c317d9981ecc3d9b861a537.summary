the prime minister will condemn ' warped ' sense of political correctness which prevented council staff from reporting abuse for fear of appearing racist teachers , social workers and councillors who turn a blind eye to child sex abuse will face up to five years in jail under plans for a new criminal offence			1
it comes as @entity16 today vows to eradicate the ‘ culture of denial ’ surrounding the issue			0
the government has decided to act following an official report that found at least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual abuse in @entity24 between 1997 and 2013			1
children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators , abducted and trafficked to other cities in @entity28			1
the prime minister will say a ‘ warped ’ sense of political correctness contributed to local authorities not acting			1
the inquiry found there were fears among council staff of being labelled racist if they focused on victims ’ descriptions of the majority of abusers as @entity44 men			1
there have been separate allegations of decades of paedophile activity by powerful individuals in churches , hospitals , schools , political parties and the @entity53			0
new measures will be unveiled at a summit in @entity56 attended by victims and survivors ’ groups , police chiefs , council leaders , health and social care professionals , and child protection experts			0
ministers plan to introduce a new criminal offence of ‘ wilful neglect ’ of children suffering abuse , and apply it to social workers , teachers and elected council members			2
a similar offence has recently been introduced in the health service and is punishable by up to five years in jail or an unlimited fine , and unlimited fines for organisations			0
as well as new sanctions for public sector workers who fail to protect children , the government will announce a new national helpline for professionals to blow the whistle on bad practice			2
child sex abuse is also to be prioritised as a ‘ national threat ’ by police and crime commissioners and chief constables			0
the prime minister will say : ‘ we have all been appalled at the abuse suffered by so many young girls in @entity24 and elsewhere across the country			1
‘ children were ignored , sometimes even blamed , and issues were swept under the carpet – often because of a warped and misguided sense of political correctness			1
' that culture of denial which let them down so badly must be eradicated			0
@entity107 , the former police and crime commissioner of @entity109 , resigned over the scandal ' today , i am sending an unequivocal message that professionals who fail to protect children will be held properly accountable and council bosses who preside over such catastrophic failure will not see rewards for that failure			2
‘ but it is not just about introducing new policies			0
it is about making sure that the professionals we charge with protecting our children – the council staff , police officer and social workers – do the jobs they are paid to do			1
’ the new offence of wilful neglect will apply when there has been a failure to act when a court concludes that a ‘ moral duty ’ to do so exists			0
it is expected to sit alongside a separate ‘ mandatory reporting ’ law , which would apply in schools , hospitals , churches , or sports clubs operated by a national body			0
similar laws already exist in @entity143 , @entity144 , the @entity145 and @entity146 which impose a legal duty on professionals such as teachers , social workers , police and doctors to report suspicions of abuse or face legal consequences .			2
