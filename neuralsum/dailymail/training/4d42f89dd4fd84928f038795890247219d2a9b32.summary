they then eased up and @entity18 ' @entity5 restored some pride with @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 touchdowns but @entity11 had the final say in the last minute			2
over the line : @entity0 ' @entity11 scores a try during the @entity3 victory over @entity5 on friday close quarters : @entity0 ' @entity29 is tackled by @entity5 ' @entity30 the first half was scrappy but @entity7 were still far too strong for the @entity5 who , 11 points adrift of safety with just seven games remaining , are all but condemned to the drop			1
@entity5 felt they were harshly penalised by referee @entity38 - who had earlier halted play to change a faulty whistle - in the ninth minute but @entity7 took full advantage as @entity29 sent @entity10 over			1
the @entity5 did respond but @entity22 failed to gather a high ball and a chance was missed			2
when the evergreen @entity11 hit an @entity15 pass at speed to burst through a gap and race through to score from 60 metres after 16 minutes , the game already seemed beyond @entity5			2
@entity12 barged through several attempted tackles to add a third by the posts before @entity13 outsprinted the defence to score out wide after more good work by @entity11			0
saints punished more sloppy work on the stroke of half - time after @entity55 lost possession , as quick hands from the @entity58 , @entity11 and @entity59 set up @entity15			0
hands off : @entity0 ' @entity60 ( left ) is challenged by @entity30 as he tries to keep hold of the ball hug : @entity0 ' @entity13 ( right ) is congratulated by @entity15 after scoring a try @entity13 's missed conversion from the touchline was his only wayward attempt of the match			0
@entity5 could not stem the tide and within three minutes of the restart @entity69 charged through a hole and laid off for @entity72 to finish			2
the agony continued for the visitors as @entity7 swept the ball along the line for @entity17 to dive over in familiar fashion on the right			0
with the game all but won , @entity7 eased off and were caught out by four quickfire @entity81 pounced on a bouncing ball to touch down just before the hour and moments later the @entity5 scrum - half launched a high kick which @entity15 was unable to reach			1
@entity86 nipped in to score in the corner			0
breaking free : st @entity88 's @entity58 runs with the ball as @entity5 's @entity22 ( right ) gives chase party time : @entity11 ( left ) celebrates scoring a try with @entity16 as @entity0 win 46 - 22 encouraged , the @entity5 played a bit more expansively and pieced together a nice try for @entity95 converted all three tries and with just over seven minutes remaining , found space to touch down himself on the left			1
it was too little too late for the visitors , but they had at least brought some respectability to the scoreline			0
the tries conceded may concern @entity7 coach @entity105 but @entity11 , still performing brilliantly at the age of 34 , wrapped up the tryscoring in the dying seconds with a poacher 's finish .			0
