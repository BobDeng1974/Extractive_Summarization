by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 17:51 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 18:02 est , 11 september 2013 claims : @entity3 , who commissioned the report ministers hired accountants to ‘ dress up ’ figures that would show the @entity11 rail project providing a £ 15billion a year economic boost , it was claimed yesterday			1
transport secretary @entity3 commissioned a report by @entity14 which said the £ 43billion scheme would rapidly ‘ pay for itself ’			1
but critics of the plan said the 92 - page document was a ‘ paid - for analysis that gives the “ right answer ”			0
’ it was also described as a ‘ desperate attempt to justify a seriously flawed project ’ , while the @entity25 ’ @entity24 said mr @entity3 was simply getting sharp accountants to dress up the figures based on ‘ dodgy assumptions ’			1
economic modellers at @entity14 drew up their assessment on the high speed rail project at a cost of more than £ 240,000			1
mr @entity3 said it provided the ‘ hard evidence ’ needed to convince sceptics			0
the £ 15billion a year benefits cited in the report meant the £ 43billion line – plus £ 7billion for trains – will ‘ pay for itself ’ in just a few years , he added			1
speaking at the @entity40 in @entity41 , he shrugged off @entity42 claims that the true cost would be £ 73billion , and dismissed other estimates of up to £ 100billion			2
protest : the @entity11 pressure group outside @entity46 in @entity41 with a 10 foot high inflatable white elephant as the secretary of state for transport @entity48 and staff of @entity51 give evidence to the @entity54 inquiry of @entity11 however , briefing notes prepared ahead of the report ’s launch instructed its authors how best to respond to awkward questions including : ‘ have you fiddled the figures ? ’			1
@entity62 of @entity14 insisted they had not been ‘ fiddled ’ to please their government client			1
ministers and accountants at @entity14 say their @entity11 report looks only at the economic benefits of the high speed rail scheme - which they calculate to be £ 15billion a year by 2037 – not the costs			1
and they admit they took an ‘ alternative ’ approach to doing that calculation – which could be at odds with more ‘ conventional ’ ways of measuring economic benefits.ministers say the conventional @entity79 analysis fails to take account of the full benefits to the regions which the new @entity14 study has addressed.littered with complex mathematical formulae , the @entity14 report explains its methodology by saying : ’ the analysis focuses on the potential impact of investment in @entity11 on the structure of regional economies in the longer term			1
‘ it is therefore different from conventional approaches to the appraisal of transport schemes , which are based on the monetary value of time and cost changes			0
’ the report stresses : ’ it does not seek to value time and cost changes directly			0
‘ instead , it aims to understand how these changes to travel times and costs influence regional economic performance , both in terms of overall economic productivity and the location of economic activity			0
’ it says : ’ the analysis provides an alternative approach to conventional transport appraisal , and the estimated net benefits should not be considered as comparable or additional to those estimated by conventional appraisal techniques			0
’ but critics and campaigners say his is gobbledegook			0
he said : ‘ no , absolutely not			0
you would not expect a respected accountancy firm to put their reputation on the line by doing any such thing			0
’ he added that the report was ‘ robust ’ , had been peer - reviewed by independent economists and would ‘ withstand academic scrutiny ’			1
the analysis also ‘ shows beyond reasonable doubt that @entity11 brings net benefits to the country of many times the scheme ’s cost ’			2
however , the @entity136 called the project ‘ a high speed gravy train ’ , branding the accountants ’ analysis ‘ one - sided and unconvincing ’			1
head of transport dr @entity142 said : ‘ its conclusions are based on highly questionable assumptions			0
’ standard cost - benefit analysis shows it to be ‘ extremely poor value for money ’ , he added			2
@entity150 of the @entity25 ’ @entity24 said the report was ‘ an expensive propaganda exercise ’ , adding : ‘ the government has squandered taxpayers ’ money on a cynical attempt to win over the many , many people who think this white elephant is the wrong way to spend tens of billions of pounds of their money			2
’ the @entity24 said the new report ‘ stretches credibility ’ , did not use ‘ mainstream ’ methodology and ‘ makes a host of other questionable assumptions ’			2
the protest group ’s director @entity169 said : ‘ this latest report is a rabbit out of the hat			0
but like all conjuring tricks it lacks real substance			0
‘ they have abandoned respected approaches and paid for an analysis that ’s only virtue is it gives the “ right answer ”			0
’ the 351 - mile project , which aims to link @entity41 to @entity183 and beyond by running 225mph trains through @entity186 heartlands in @entity187 and @entity188 , is mired in controversy			1
the @entity191 ’ public accounts committee has already accused ministers of failing to make a ‘ value for money ’ case for the scheme .			2
