@entity0 , who retired last year as a lieutenant - general , said ‘ young riflemen paid the price ’ for general sir @entity5 ’s ‘ risk averse ’ mentality and fear of causing civilian casualties			1
he said that while other generals went to the front line with their men , sir @entity5 made only brief helicopter trips to safe positions and instead turned down requests for aircraft and artillery from the safety of his ‘ large , well - appointed command post			2
’ the @entity8 claimed his @entity33 counterpart was a ‘ peppy , pushy fellow ’ and said : ‘ he ’s not the type of general i would put in charge of anything			1

‘ in any operation , @entity33 troops always have the inherent right to self - defence and accusations that troops were put in unnecessary danger are nonsensical			0
