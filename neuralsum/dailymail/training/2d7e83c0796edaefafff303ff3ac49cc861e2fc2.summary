by @entity0 blast from the past : @entity2 , 25 , is keeping alive the tradition of victory rolls - a hairstyle popular in the 1940s and 50s it was a hairstyle made famous before @entity2 was even born			1
but inspired by her grandmother , the 25 - year - old is keeping alive the tradition of creating victory rolls that were popular in the 1940s and 50s and worn by actresses @entity13 and @entity15			1
miss @entity2 uses the labour intensive art of pin curling to work painstakingly with inch - wide sections of hair winding each piece into precise curls before pinning them in rows around her head			1
she then covers the whole lot with a head scarf and will then wait for up to eight hours before taking it all out and starting work sculpting it into a victory roll - which involves sweeping the top section of hair into a wave and leaving the rest loose			1
it is a lot of effort to create the dated style , especially when hot tools like curling tongs could achieve similar in a matter of minutes			2
but for @entity43 the authenticity of the creation is all part of the thrill			2
and she has even forged a business out of her passion , charging between £ 5 and £ 50 to style other women inside a garden shed she has turned into a studio			1
‘ if you ’re doing the pin curl set it gets you feeling a part of that world even more , ’ she said			2
‘ it ’s all part of the experience			0
and also it gives a better result , you get a better set if you pin curl it rather than doing it with a tong			0
there ’s lots of different ways to do it but i like it that way			0
’ she added : ‘ the pin curling is like your foundation to creating different styles and then you can expand			0
’ as well as the pop up studio , which miss @entity2 made with her parents , she also creates online video tutorials , teaching people how to recreate her style			1
star style : actresses @entity13 , pictured left , and @entity15 , pictured right , both wore victory rolls inspiration : miss @entity2 's grandmother @entity87 , @entity88 and cousin @entity86 , pictured in @entity89 in 1958 , first sparked her passion for the style dressed as her alter ego madame @entity93 in a neat grey skirt suit , black @entity96 shoes and , of course , a victory roll , she guides viewers through the process , which she learnt from reading old fashioned books			1
and sitting in her studio , surrounded by nostalgic relics and photographs of ‘ @entity110 ’ , 70 , who inspired her to recreate the styles she saw in her favourite musicals from the past , miss @entity2 said : ‘ i think women back then , especially in in the 40s with the war , women had to ration their clothing so all they had to make themselves was to do their hair and make - up and it was a big thing for themselves to make themselves feel special			1
’ she added : ‘ what i love is the innocence of it all , just waiting for your husband to come home , going dancing and spending the day in your pin curls waiting for him			0
that element of it just seems very romantic and that definitely appeals to me			0
’ successful business : @entity2 has transformed a shed into her garden into a studio where she can create traditional victory rolls for clients miss @entity2 's hair studio where she charges between £ 5 and £ 50 for different styles so much so , it would seem , that @entity43 has taken her unlikely hobby to @entity136 ( she will feature in tuesday night ’s episode ) , to compete among eight other stylists			1
and she hopes to win the contest with her styles drawn from films of the past			0
she said : ‘ i look to the past to get inspiration , especially old movies and things			0
i remember watching them as a kid with my granny so definitely since then			0
we used to get dressed up and we would act out scenes from musicals			0
we always used to watch @entity155 with @entity156 , over and over again			0
but i love @entity157 , her movies , she ’s got amazing hair			2
’ the end result : a model shows off her perfectly styled victory rolls step one : apply setting lotion to wet hair to help curls form step two : divide into one - inch sections , ready to make pin curls step three : take the first piece of hair , wind into a loop and pin flat step four : repeat for each piece , creating rows down head step five : leave pin curls for at least six hours or overnight step six : take out all pins and brush the hair with a bristle brush step seven : select a triangle of hair on one side of the parting at the front of the head step eight : backcomb the roots of this section to add volume step nine : roll the section down towards the head and pin in place , leaving rest of the hair loose step ten : finish with hair spray			1
create a second roll if desired			2
