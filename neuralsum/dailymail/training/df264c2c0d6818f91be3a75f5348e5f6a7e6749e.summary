the identity of mr @entity1 has been puzzled over for centuries after it appeared in @entity5 's book of sonnets the identity of the man @entity5 's book of sonnets was dedicated to - a enigma that has puzzled scholars for centuries - may now finally have been established			1
the first edition of @entity5 's sonnets , published in 1609 , were dedicated to a ' mr @entity1 ' , whose identity has never been proven - leading to claims it could have been a male lover			1
but an @entity20 researcher has now uncovered evidence to suggest he was not , in fact , a male lover or nobleman , but a recently deceased friend of the sonnets ' publisher			1
inscribed in the first published edition of the sonnets is a dedication to the man , whose identity has been subjected to fierce debate for centuries			2
the message reads : ' to the only begetter of these ensuing sonnets mr @entity1 all happiness and that eternity promised by our ever - living poet wisheth the well - wishing adventurer in setting forth			1
' it ends with the letters ' tt ' - believed to be the mark of the sonnets ' publisher , @entity46			2
the @entity48 reported researcher @entity49 has now found evidence linking the initials to @entity52 , who was an associate of @entity46 's			1
the two were both publishing apprentices in @entity54 , had theatre connections and came from prominent families in @entity57			0
mr @entity49 said evidence for his conclusions included that @entity52 died two years before the sonnets were published and it would have been an insult to refer to an aristocrat as ' mr ' - ruling out mr @entity52 's identity as a nobleman			1
his theory , that it was a tribute to someone deceased , would also explain the spiritual theme of the message			0
researcher @entity49 has now found evidence linking the dedication ' mr @entity1 ' , whose identity has never been proven , to @entity52 , an associate of @entity5 's publisher mr @entity49 said : nobody was aware that there was [ also ] a publisher of that name who had died in 1607 , ' said @entity49			1
' seeing the dedication as a memorial makes a lot of sense , ' according to the @entity48			0
throughout the centuries since the sonnets were published , speculation about mr @entity52 's identity has varied wildly			1
the most likely candidates were often thought to have been his friends @entity88 , @entity89 , or @entity90 , @entity91			0
@entity92 explored a different theory , writing a fictional 1889 story about whether it could be a cross-dressing boy actor called @entity96 - and the same person as the ' fair youth ' of the sonnets			0
that could also help explain punning references to the name ' will ' , it was claimed			0
a rare copy of @entity5 's @entity105 ( pictured ) , the first ever compilation of the @entity5 's plays , was uncovered in a provincial library in northern @entity108 last year the world 's most famous playwright has long caused controversy among literary scholars			1
last year , a new debate broke out between some of the world 's top shakespeare experts over whether the playwright 's sonnets prove he was attracted to men			2
sir @entity120 , a visiting professor at @entity121 , began the row by condemning a book review which suggested @entity124 appears in a ' primarily homosexual context '			0
in a letter to the @entity127 , he said the claim was ' anachronistic ' because scholars now accept there were forms of rhetoric that allowed men to express love without implying sexual attraction			0
but the most enduring debate about the @entity5 is whether or not the playwright wrote everything that has been attributed to him			2
doubts have surrounded @entity5 's authorship for 150 years , with @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 named as the likely writers of his sonnets and plays			1
and recently , @entity5 's well - delivered lines have even been blamed for creating a painful stigma for millions of people suffering skin disease			2
researchers from @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 , analysed @entity5 â€™s language and found that it reflected the @entity158 obsession with perfect , unmarked , pale skin			0
one of the most graphic examples occurs when @entity161 insults his scheming daughter @entity162 , declaring : ' thou art a boil , a plague sore , an embossed carbuncle ' .			0
