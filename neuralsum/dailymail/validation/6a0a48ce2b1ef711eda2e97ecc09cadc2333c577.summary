@entity0 breathed a sigh of relief in the sunny early saturday morning at @entity3 when @entity6 's former @entity5 driver @entity4 abandoned his legal action against the team			1
he had been suing them for dropping him despite having a contract to race for them this season , starting with sunday 's @entity14 @entity13			1
courts in @entity3 found in his favour , saying he had a right to drive			0
however , he has not got a super-licence , so could not			0
@entity4 has decided to drop his case against former side @entity6 after settling out of court @entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) will race for @entity6 in the absence of @entity24 der @entity4 this brought about an impasse : @entity6 would be in contempt of court if they left him out			1
but they could not put him in according to the @entity31 rules			0
heads we knocked together over friday night and @entity34 settled out of court			2
@entity24 der @entity4 wrote on @entity36 : ' with respect to the interest of motorsport , and @entity0 in particular , i have decided to give up my legal rights to race this weekend at the @entity42			1
' as i am a passionate race driver this decision has been very difficult for me			2
' however i also wish to respect the interest of the @entity31 , @entity6 , as well as @entity22 and @entity45			2
' crucially , @entity34 has made clear further negotiations need to take place , however , before the matter can finally be closed			0
the 29 - year - old added : ' my management will continue talks with @entity6 early next week to find a mutually acceptable solution for the current situation that has now arisen			1
' i am confident such solution will be found and i will inform the media once done			0
' @entity24 der @entity4 dropped the case against @entity6 out of respect to ' motorsport , and @entity0 in particular ' @entity59 and @entity22 will race for them in his place			1
both were named on @entity6 's race entry and took part in second practice on friday , having sat out of the first session while the lawyers argued			1
with three valid driver contracts and only two race seats available , @entity6 and @entity68 had found themselves mired in controversy			1
given @entity6 's financial struggles last year , when approached by two drivers in @entity45 and @entity22 who could offer considerable sums of money in sponsorship , both the @entity77 and @entity78 were signed			2
but with @entity24 der @entity4 on contract , and despite also having paid up front - albeit a figure less than that of @entity45 and @entity22 - the battle became legal			1
it remains to be seen what ' mutually acceptable solution ' can now be ironed out between the two parties			0
whatever the outcome , under - pressure team principal @entity68 , a trained lawyer , has emerged from the sorry mess in a poor light			1
@entity6 team principal @entity68 insists she will not resign from her role despite the recent saga at the circuit on friday , while unable to talk about the case as it remained ongoing , she did insist however she remained competent to carry on with her role as team boss			1
' i do n't see it ( the case ) having any effect , ' @entity68 said			2
' we have a very clear view of what we did			0
we took action after thinking about it for a while			0
' for us that was very clear , but the outcome is different			0
' pressed on whether she had considered resigning , @entity68 added : ' i 've not considered that			2
' this whole matter does not have any effect on the way we work , the way the team works			0
' @entity68 did concede , however , the past week had damaged morale given the team 's name had been dragged through the courts			1
' it 's had a very negative impact on the team because the situation was , for a while , unclear , ' she added			0
' we now have certain actions taken against the team , and we are acting accordingly			0
