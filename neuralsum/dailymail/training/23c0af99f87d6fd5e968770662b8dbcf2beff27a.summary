at a press conference on friday , @entity2 , who expressed his ' revulsion ' at the thought of @entity17 's abuse at the @entity3 , claimed he never asked questions about the nature of the @entity21 investigation dropped last year , saying he wanted to ensure the independence of news and current affairs			1
at the time mr @entity2 was director of the vision division , which is responsible for commissioning , producing , scheduling and broadcasting the content of all of the @entity3 's television channels			1
the @entity30 reported that media commentator @entity31 , who presents @entity34 's @entity31 , yesterday called the claim ' simply implausible ' , adding : ' the idea that he did n't know is barely credible			1
' @entity38 , the former chief executive of @entity39 , added his voice to the condemnation , saying @entity42 would have to be ' pretty brain dead ' not to investigate the programme 's subject matter			0
mr @entity2 , who also apologised to victims on behalf of the @entity3 , told reporters that @entity48 ( head of news ) had told him that @entity21 was planning a programme about @entity17			1
he said that he said ' thanks for letting me know ' , but asked no questions about it			0
a senior @entity3 newsroom source told the @entity30 : ' it defies credibility that he did n't try to find this out			2
' the idea that , as head of vision , in charge of the @entity64 schedule , he just said ' thanks for letting me know ' is ridiculous			0
' the best thing you can say is he looks completely incurious to the point of being irresponsible			0
' tension : a source says @entity3 director general 's comments have split the @entity21 newsroom the source added that @entity21 journalists are ' extremely tense ' and feel like they were left ' looking stupid ' by mr @entity77 's comments			1
' you have a huge national story that was not mentioned on @entity21 until 10 or 11 days after it blew up			2
( the newsroom ) is getting uncomfortable			0
it is a ludicrous situation , ' they added			0
the source also spoke about the claim of @entity87 , the editor who dropped the @entity89 investigation , that the story was not good enough to air			2
they added : ' he did everything he could to make it impossible for the story to run ... in most newsrooms if you are not quite there ( with a story ) you would just keep going			0
' the paper added that it understands the @entity21 team had spoken to at least 10 women , including witnesses and victims			0
a @entity3 spokesperson said : ' @entity2 has made his position exceptionally clear			1
as said at the press briefing on friday , ' i was the director of vision for the television department at the @entity3 , i had no influence or authority over investigations carried out by @entity114 and it 's very important that i always behaved in a manner which absolutely bore out that lack of authority or responsibility '			2
' sorry : @entity2 also apologised to victims on behalf of the @entity3 and says he feels ' revulsion ' that the attacks may have taken place at the @entity3 sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
