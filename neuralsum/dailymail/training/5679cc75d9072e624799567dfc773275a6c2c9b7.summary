lined up next to their deadly shipment of bomb - making equipment and weapons , these four @entity1 fanatics include a woman clad head to foot in a blue burka			1

the group were arrested by police in @entity17 as they tried to make their way in to the country on thursday			1
arrested : four @entity1 fighters , including a woman dressed in a full - length burka , stand handcuffed near seized weapons at the police headquarters in @entity25 , eastern @entity17 caught : the four @entity1 militants - including a woman and a child - were arrested by @entity30 border police at the @entity32 border crossing between @entity17 and @entity10 officers discovered they had been carrying an assault rifle and ammunition			1
