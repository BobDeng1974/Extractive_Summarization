by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 14 july 2012 updated : 09:53 est , 14 july 2012 it 's the sight every diver fears - a fearsome four - metre long shark eerily drifting into view as the support boat bobs far away on the horizon			2
but that is what faced divers @entity9 and @entity11 when they went spearfishing off the western coast of @entity13 at the weekend			1
the pair spent a terrifying three minutes trying to fend the shark off with nothing but spear guns and a knife as the animal circled around them			1
unnerving : @entity9 and @entity11 spent three minutes fending off a shark when it approached them in waters off the coast of western @entity13 eventually the shark swam away and the duo were able to make their way back to the safety of their nearby boat			1
amazing the dramatic scene was all recorded by a camera attached to mr @entity11 's head			2
mr @entity9 described the frightening attack to @entity13 's @entity35			1
he said : ' i was on the top of the water getting ready to go down and i felt something moving behind me			2
' i turned around and all i saw was the back section of the shark			2
mate , it was a metre away			0
my heart sank and i just tried to get @entity11 's attention			0
' the divers were ten minutes into the trip when the shocking encounter took place			1
deadly : mr @entity11 pokes his spear gun in the direction of the shark as its eye glistens in the water squaring up : the shark turns on mr @entity11 an makes a beeline for his speargun distant : the pair 's boat can be seen in the video 150ft away - too far for the divers to reach relief : @entity11 , left , screams with joy after clambering back on to the boat following the encounter , with fellow diver @entity9 , pictured right in the video the boat can be seen on the horizon , about 150 feet away and the pair had no choice but to stand their ground			1
the shark launched the attack close to the surface and the camera shows both men constantly bobbing above and below the water			0
incredibly they remained calm throughout the encounter and were able to send the shark on its way by prodding it with their spear guns			0
as the above video shows , they were understandably overjoyed when they arrived back at their boat unharmed			0
in an interview with @entity91 mr @entity9 added : ' in the water it just looked massive			0
' i think if it wanted to it could have made a meal out of us , really			0
' on the same day as mr @entity11 and @entity102 ' heart - stopping meeting with the shart , a great white attacked a kayaker off the coast of @entity106			1
the shark took a bite out of the kayak and knocked the man into the water , but he was unhurt .			0

@entity113 circled around divers for three minutes
