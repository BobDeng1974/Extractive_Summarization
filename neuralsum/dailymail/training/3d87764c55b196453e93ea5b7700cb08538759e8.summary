by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 neither @entity2 or @entity3 are fully - fledged @entity5 players just yet , but both were on the scoresheet as the @entity9 champions got their @entity11 tour off to a winning start at @entity13			1
@entity2 will officially join @entity5 once the @entity9 ratify the @entity15 ’s £ 1.5million move from @entity16 , and highly - rated @entity18 striker @entity3 can only loosely be referred to as a triallist after earning a place on the flight to @entity11 during last week ’s training camp in @entity23			1
the teenager came through the @entity25 to dream programme in @entity27 , which has close links with @entity5 , and starred in last summer ’s under - 17 @entity29			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity31 v @entity5 : @entity3 goal blue moon : @entity2 celebrates after opening his @entity5 account @entity35 for heights : @entity37 rises above everyone to put @entity5 ahead 2 - 1 before half - time great start : new signing @entity2 gave @entity5 a lead in the first - half in @entity43 from the spot : @entity45 slots home @entity5 's third goal after @entity48 was brought down sporting @entity49 : @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60			1

scorers : @entity2 3 , @entity37 45 , @entity45 pen 73 , @entity82 : 18,484			2
@entity37 and @entity45 were the other scorers as @entity5 eased to victory over the current @entity85 champions			2
most of @entity88 ’s star players were still missing but there was another outing for new signings @entity91 and @entity69 as well as some who might not be at the club much longer , such as @entity95 , @entity48 , @entity67 and @entity70			0
the banners that read ‘ @entity97 ’ and ‘ @entity98 ’ made out as though @entity5 were about to face @entity99 , not their friendly hosts from @entity11 ’s mid-west			0
in fact , the promise of a hot reception extended no further than the temperature which had topped 110 degrees on tuesday and was still far from comfortable by the time the match kicked off on wednesday evening after the obligatory national anthems , fireworks and , finally , a video of some of @entity31 ’s finest moments			0
@entity5 made something of a mockery of the tub - thumping build - up when they opened the scoring after just two minutes , however			2
the ball fell kindly for @entity2 on the edge of the area and the @entity15 applied a clinical finish by hooking a volley inside the post			0
squad rotation : @entity5 started without several of the regular first - team line - up in @entity43 rare glory : @entity37 ( centre ) is congratulated by @entity68 after putting @entity5 ahead sliding in : @entity126 midfielder @entity56 ( left ) battles with @entity5 forward @entity3 spot on : @entity45 gets a hug from @entity2 after scoring from the penalty spot @entity3 is an even more unfamiliar name to @entity5 fans and the @entity18 striker , wearing no 72 , would have added a second but for a fingertip save from goalkeeper @entity50			1
however , the current @entity85 champions and @entity137 leaders came into the match unbeaten in six games and were not about to roll over in front of their own fans			0
@entity58 hit the bar moments after @entity2 ’s opener and @entity59 beat @entity63 at the second attempt shortly afterwards only to see his effort ruled out for offside			0
@entity5 ’s luck ran out on the half hour mark , though , when they left @entity58 unmarked and he had time to bring down @entity152 ’s cross from the right and draw @entity63 out of his goal before sliding home an equaliser			1
level : @entity58 celebrates after scoring the equaliser after half an hour @entity5 should have restored their lead in the 38th minute when @entity66 ’s long ball set @entity73 free on goal but he dithered with only @entity50 to beat and @entity52 , once of @entity162 and @entity163 , got back to make a vital challenge			1
the @entity9 side were not to be denied though and grabbed a second on the stroke of half - time when @entity68 won a freekick which he swung in from the right for @entity37 to power in a header from close range			1
@entity31 again threatened an equaliser in the second period – not least when @entity63 produced a reflex save to keep out @entity177 ’s effort – but @entity5 made sure of victory when @entity177 brought down @entity48 and @entity45 comfortably converted from the spot before @entity3 added a late fourth with a cool finish			2
good days ' work : @entity5 will take confidence heading in to the rest of their tour @entity186 calm over squad despite @entity189 injury			0

new signing @entity2 puts @entity5 ahead after just three minutes
but @entity58 equalises on the half - hour mark for the hosts
@entity37 header gives @entity5 the lead again just before the break
@entity45 extends @entity5 's lead from the spot with *20* minutes left
@entity3 rounds off the win in the closing stages
