culture secretary @entity7 has made clear the cost is ' a lot of money for some people ' with some in the government calling for it to be done away with			1
one unnamed minister told the @entity26 : ' there is a policy proposal going around to cut the licence fee by £ 50			1
' the negotiation after the election will be very big			0
some cabinet ministers regard £ 50 as the minimum cut			0
' however a @entity19 source said : ' the @entity19 already has 25 per cent less to spend over this licence fee period and a reduction of a further £ 50 is equivalent to the loss of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
' the radical £ 50 plan is not thought to have the backing of mr @entity7 who has so far refused to state what level he thinks the licence fee should be after the charter renewal			1
last month he told the @entity50 : ' £ 145.50 is a lot of money for some people			1
' it 's incumbent on all public bodies to be vigilant when spending other people 's money , and the @entity19 is no exception to this			2
' a source at the @entity60 today stressed that money would remain tight at the corporation			0

ministers are already examining whether not paying the licence fee should still be a criminal offence			2
culture secretary @entity7 was made clear the £ 145.50 fee is a lot of money for some people , but has not put a figure on the size of a cut he would like to see some 200,000 people a year end up in court accused of not buying a tv licence			1
