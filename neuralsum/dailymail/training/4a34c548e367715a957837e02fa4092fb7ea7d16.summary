by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:18 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 6 february 2013 @entity2 star @entity2 has been revealed as the inspiration behind the government ’s wide - ranging reforms of the education system			1
she was ridiculed in her first appearance on the @entity10 show when she thought @entity11 was a foreign country			2
but education secretary @entity12 launched a spirited defence of the late tv celebrity , insisting she was let down by her teachers but was bright enough to turn her notoriety into millions of pounds which she used to send her children to a top school			1
education secretary @entity12 said @entity2 had proved that she was intelligent but had been let down by her schooling mr @entity12 even ranked @entity2 , who died from cervical cancer in 2009 , alongside @entity25 @entity24 thinker @entity23 when naming the influences on his reforms			1
he insisted @entity2 ’s ‘ lack of knowledge ’ was the fault of her poor education but proved her intelligence by turning her brief spell in the limelight coming in @entity2 2002 into a multi-million pound career			1
‘ when she first appeared on our screens in big brother @entity40 was regarded as paragon of invincible ignorance , ’ mr @entity12 said			1
‘ she was derided and mocked because she thought that @entity45 was in @entity46			1
on being told that @entity45 is in @entity11 , she assumed that to be abroad , and referred to it as ‘ @entity48 ’			1
‘ her other misconceptions included the belief that @entity51 was a person and not a city			1
’ mr @entity12 said that his reforms were not really conservative , but uncompromisingly radical mr @entity12 said it was a ‘ double cruelty ’ to mock these errors			1
‘ deriving entertainment from another ’s misfortunes is wrong in itself			0
but in any case , her lack of knowledge was not her fault but the education system ’s			2
’ but he said there was ‘ no doubt ’ that she was intelligent			2
‘ she exploited the notoriety she had earned to make herself a ubiquitous television and magazine presence , earning huge sums in the process and becoming in due course far wealthier than most of her detractors			2
’ and when diagnosed with cervical cancer she ‘ husbanded her earnings ’ for her two sons to attend ‘ the most traditional , academically demanding prep school she could find ’			0
‘ so they could enjoy the best education reality tv could buy			2
’ mr @entity12 said @entity2 was an example of thousands of parents who want their children to do better			1
‘ because parents – especially poorer parents – want their children to get up and get on			0
and that means acquiring a proper rounded rigorous education			0
in the hope that they can choose to go to university			0
‘ @entity40 knew that the most precious thing she could bequeath her children was not money but knowledge and the best guarantee of their future happiness was not the power to indulge whims with cash but the power to choose your own future through education			0
‘ the idea that there is a significant number of parents who lack ambition for their children , who are not aspirational , who scorn book learning and are hostile to academic excellence is just not true			0
’ he said that pupils should have a ' stock of knowledge ' about history , culture , maths and science in order to understand the world around them			0
ministers are due to set out their new curriculum for primary and secondary schools within days			0
but @entity131 's @entity130 today accused mr @entity12 of pursuing an ' outdated ' measure of educational achievement based on a narrow group of academic subjects			1
the shadow education secretary said he wants to see ' rigour in the whole curriculum ' , rather than in selected subjects			1
mr @entity130 said : ' for him it 's only aspirational to pursue an academic route			2
this is one of the many false choices that he argues			0
' i believe that high quality vocational education is something to aspire to , and as the evidence shows from many high performing countries in vocational education - like @entity151 and @entity153 - it 's the high flyers who choose to study it			0
i want high quality academic and high quality vocational education			2
' @entity2 appeared on @entity2 in 2002 and the celebrity version in 2007 , turning her notoriety into a multi-million pound career before her death in 2009 in a speech to the @entity165 last night , mr @entity12 said his reforms were not conservative ' but rather uncompromisingly radical '			1
he said : ' because conservatives have always tended to suspect that many of the things which need to be protected from generation to generation - the @entity182 , the @entity174 , @entity175 , agreeable homes with lovely views over the @entity178 , marriage , the bench of bishops , @entity168 and @entity170 directorships - can only be protected if they 're enjoyed by a minority			0
' i do n't look at the world that way			0
i think the things we need to protect and enhance - a love of literature , pride in our history , scientific curiosity , beautiful written @entity195 , innovative and creative mathematical thinking , joy in discovery , colleges and universities , liberal learning and openness to the world , female emancipation and social mobility - are all better protected if we make them as universal as possible			0
' and i suspect that even if not every conservative agrees with me , @entity2 and @entity23 would			1

education secretary ranks late big brother star alongside @entity25 @entity24 thinker @entity23
@entity2 was ridiculed for thinking @entity45 was in @entity46 and @entity51 was a person
but mr @entity12 says she was failed by her schooling but was intelligent enough to turn notoriety into millions
@entity131 claims @entity216 focus on academic subjects is too narrow
