by @entity1 reporter published : 14:26 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 02:04 est , 24 october 2013 a 25 - year - old @entity3 surfer has survived a dramatic attack by a 12 - foot tiger shark by jumping on top of it and punching it in the eye			1
@entity10 , a former boxer , said he was surfing off @entity11 near @entity12 in @entity13 on sunday with friends when he spotted a dark shape moving toward him and his board through the water			1
he explained that he was looking for a wave and seated with his feet dangling from the board			2
' i look down and see what i thought was a sting ray , ' @entity10 told @entity25			2
' it came up on me and i jerked my foot and kicked it a couple of times			2
it went for the bite and missed my leg			0
' i rolled to the top of the shark and punched it in the mouth and got one shot in the eye , ' @entity10 said			1
' i thought i was going to die unless i put up the best fight i ever had			0
' he estimated that he hit the shark , which he guessed was about 12 feet long , about eight times			2
but when he punched it once in the eye , it recoiled , giving him a chance to jump on his board and frantically paddle back to the shore with another surfer			1
' at that point i was pretty much in a full panic and started swimming for my life , ' he said			0
' i saw the shadow of its belly following me underneath			0
' attack : he was attacked by the tiger shark ( file photo ) as he looked for waves on sunday afternoon even though the shark followed , it did not attack again			1
when they reached the shore , he was welcomed back by a group of people and a tourist gave him $ 50 and told him to buy a bottle , @entity82 reported			0
@entity10 's only injuries were scratches from the shark 's rough skin on his knuckles and legs			1
' i 'm lucky to be here today , ' he said			0
the 7 - foot board , however , was left with a semi-circle imprint of the shark 's jaws			1
@entity10 , who surfed again monday at another beach , said he plans to put it up on his wall			1
@entity10 moved to @entity13 from @entity104 two years ago and said , while he 's been traumatized by the experience , he will be returning to the water			1
scene : the shark was seen just off @entity109 , pictured , which has had no other shark attacks this year but he said he wo n't be using the board - which displays the circular teeth marks of the shark - again ; instead he plans to hang it on his wall			1
' i 'll surf the rest of my life , ' he told @entity82			0
tiger sharks are considered dangerous due to their size and indiscriminate feeding behavior and willingness to eat nearly anything - including objects at the surface , @entity118 explains			2
some bites sustained by people are thought to be the result of investigatory behavior as the sharks bite creatures or objects to determine whether they are suitable to be eaten			0
there have been no reported shark attacks around @entity13 this year			0
three were recorded last year			0

@entity10 suffered only *grazes* from the shark 's rough skin
he plans to keep the board on his wall - and get back in the water again
