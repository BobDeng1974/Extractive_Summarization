it was an excoriating public dressing - down , an email fired off by a retired naval commander to the three children he regards as a ‘ bitter disappointment ’			1
but yesterday former nuclear submarine captain @entity5 , 67 , got an unequivocal broadside back			1
after the publication of his father ’s heartfelt tirade – a no - punches - pulled salvo accusing his public school - educated children of failing in their careers and marriages – mr @entity16 ’s son @entity15 , 35 , replied : ‘ sorry , but you made me			1
’ ' cock - up ' children : @entity21 and his sister @entity22 were the recipients of an email from their father in which he spoke of the ' bitter disappointment ' he felt at his children 's inability to pursue fulfilling careers speaking as he prepared for his shift at a taxi office , @entity15 , bare - chested and sporting a stomach tattoo , said his father could no longer treat him ‘ like a sailor in his command ’			1
and he added his father had done ‘ enough of that in my formative years to ensure that i do not have the confidence to succeed in life now ’			1
he accused mr @entity5 of acting like his own father before him , and insisted he would not speak to him again without an apology			1
the family feud burst into the public domain when @entity5 published the email at the request of daughter @entity46 , 40 – one of his targets – who now lives in @entity48 and works as a translator for a publisher			1
she is the only one of the siblings still speaking to her parents			1
dear all three with last evening ’s crop of whinges and tidings of more rotten news for which you seem to treat your mother like a cess - pit , i feel it is time to come off my perch			1
we are seeing the miserable death throes of the fourth of your collective marriages at the same time we see the advent of a fifth ... having done our best to provide for our children , we naturally hoped to see them provide happy and stable homes for their own children			1
fulfilling careers based on your educations would have helped – but as yet none of you is what i would term properly self - supporting			2
so we witness the introduction to this life of six beautiful children none of whose parents have had the maturity to make a reasonable fist at making essential threshold decisions			2
the predictable result has been a decade of deep unhappiness over the fates of our grandchildren			2
if it was n’t for them , @entity95 and i would not be too concerned , as each of you crashes from one cock - up to the next			2
it makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation - driven and then to see these lovely little people being so woefully let down by you			0
i can now tell you that i for one have had enough of being forced to live through the never - ending bad dream of our children ’s domestic ineptitudes			2
i want to hear no more from any of you until you have a success or an achievement to tell me about			0
if you think i have been unfair in what i have said , by all means try to persuade me to change my mind			0
but you wo n’t do it by simply whingeing			0
if that is n’t possible then i rest my case			0
i am bitterly , bitterly disappointed			0
dad in his email , addressed to ‘ @entity131 ’ , mr @entity5 spoke of the ‘ bitter disappointment ’ he felt at the ‘ miserable death throes of the fourth of your collective marriages ’ , his children ’s inability to pursue fulfilling careers based on public school educations , and the fact none of them was ‘ properly self - supporting ’			1
he said his six ‘ beautiful ’ grandchildren had parents who lacked maturity and sound judgment ‘ as each of you consciously , and with eyes wide open , crashes from one cock - up to the next ’			0
witheringly , he added that for he and his wife @entity147 , ‘ it makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation - driven , and then helplessly to see these lovely little people being so woefully let down by you , their parents ’			1
yesterday @entity5 told @entity148 he had ‘ nothing to apologise for ’ and that many friends facing similar challenges had emailed him messages of support			1
earlier , @entity15 , clearly furious that the row had gone public – through an article in yesterday ’s @entity156 – said : ‘ i ’m not going to dignify him with a full response			1
‘ he knows what the score is			0
i ’ve spoken to my @entity95 and i responded to his email			2
i likened him to his own father and left it at that			1
he said what he wanted to say but there are other things he should n’t have said			0
‘ he said he did n’t want any of us to contact him again until we had some good news			0
well , if he wants us to talk to him now , then he should n’t have written that			0
that ’s what needs to be apologised for			0
’ speaking from the @entity174 terraced house where he is living with his sister , @entity15 insisted his father had only himself to blame			1
‘ he compared us to his friends ’ children and said what an embarrassment we were and how he ca n’t boast about us , ’ he said			2
‘ well , i ’m sorry , but you made me			0
that also needs to be apologised for			0
’ but perhaps something of his father ’s sense of duty has rubbed off on @entity15 after all , as he insisted he was unable to stay and provide a full interview as he could not let his employer down			1
‘ my father made me who i am today and i think he did a good job , ’ he said			2
‘ i do not leech off him , my mother or society – except for a brief stint on @entity195 – nor am i a criminal of any sort			0
i try to keep to the values i have been brought up with			0
’ nearby , at the family ’s detached , six - bedroomed house in a @entity174 suburb , an unrepentant @entity5 made a robust defence of the decision to set out his frustrations in the email , sent earlier this year			1
and his wife @entity147 made clear she backed every word			1
‘ absolutely , it needed saying , ’ she insisted			0
‘ an email was the right way to go because they absolutely took notice of something there in black and white			2
’ mr @entity5 said : ‘ what i was saying to my children was that if they got their ducks in a row , their children would be getting a better start			1
as a father and a grandfather , do n’t you have a duty to do that ? i think you do			2
i do n’t like living with the repercussions of this and it makes you very sad that your children hate you			2
happier times : @entity5 poses with his daugher @entity22 on her wedding day			1
he laments his children 's inability to pursue fulfilling careers @entity239 's girl : @entity46 now lives in @entity48			1
she is the only one of the siblings still talking to her parents unapologetic : @entity5 ( pictured yesterday ) thinks his email was necessary ‘ there are people in society who desperately need financial support and for that support to be sucked up by people , my children , who could do better is not acceptable to me			1
‘ my message to other parents who feel as i do is that you have a social responsibility to say your piece			0
i can remember my father saying things to me that i did n’t like to hear			2
friends have emailed me to say , “ i ’ve had to write a letter like that and it ’s not nice			0
” they have been very supportive			0
‘ if you had one child like this you ’d think , “ do i say anything ? ” but i ’ve had three out of three and you wonder whether you ’re an appalling father with defective genes			2
it ’s not just one of them that ’s had a failed marriage – it ’s three out of three			0
‘ @entity22 said to me , “ we ’re not triplets , we ’re all individuals			0
” but they all needed the same message for their own individual reasons			0
i thought that by sending it to all three none of them would be singled out as a black sheep			0
‘ one of the gratifying things about it is that they closed ranks and they came together and decided how they were going to cope with it			0
i think that ’s fantastic			0
certainly @entity22 has had this appalling email chucked at her and said , “ @entity291 , it ’s time to pull my socks up ”			2
’ historic : like his father , @entity15 went to @entity295 in @entity296 , where fees are £ 10,100 a term mr @entity5 , who spends his spare time restoring paintings and sailing yachts , said the children were sent to public schools because he felt it gave them the best possible start			1
like his father , @entity15 went to @entity295 in @entity296 , where fees are £ 10,100 a term			1
@entity22 , an @entity308 psychology graduate , attended @entity310 boarding school in @entity311			0
reflecting on the situation , mr @entity5 felt moved to finally observe : ‘ it ’s not a bad thing to write and say , “ hey , look , you ’re leaving a trail as you bash through life and your mum and dad are part of the wreckage			1

@entity5 sent an email to his three children speaking of ' disappointment '
@entity15 says father can no longer treat him ' like a sailor in his command '
added he had only himself to blame and likened him to his own father
@entity239 said he ' had nothing to apologise for ' while his wife backed him up
