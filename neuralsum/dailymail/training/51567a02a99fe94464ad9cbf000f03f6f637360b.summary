@entity23 , who appeared in court as part of a plea deal to get a lesser sentence for felony identity theft charges that she currently faces , tried to downplay the seriousness of her relationship with @entity32			1
watch the video here out in public : @entity8 testified about how she first met @entity32 when he contacted her through an online interest board that she ran and they began instant messaging tense : @entity32 remained expressionless throughout the trial on friday she said that they first met when he commented on a post she had published on an website dedicated to her interests , and they struck up an instant messaging conversation that turned into more			1

she repeatedly said that even though she lived in a duplex that he controlled the contract to , they kept their sexual relationship very loose after first making contact in november 2005			1
it became sexual in january 2006 - a year and three months before @entity32 's wife @entity59 was found dead in their bathtub			1
' we would see each other about a couple of times a month but there were some months where we did n't see each other , ' @entity23 said in her testimony			2
' it was a very casual thing			2
' she said that she was still seeing other people while maintaining this relationship with @entity32 and continued that level of seriousness even after she moved into a complex where he had an apartment that was not being used			2
looking over the facts : the prosecutor asked @entity23 to read out the number of texts they exchanged for a wide swath of days during the relationship , including throughout the week that his wife was found dead getting ready : @entity23 , seen walking into court in @entity87 , @entity88 on friday , said that their relationship was very casual and had been sexual for more than a year before his wife was found dead in their family home @entity23 was a nursing student at the time , and although part of her tuition was being paid for by financial aid , @entity32 also helped her with the additional payments - though she said in court today that those financial entanglements had no reflection on whether or not their relationship was serious			1
' i was still seeing other people , i was very busy so the fact that i did see him a little more than other people â€™ was insignificant			0
motives : @entity23 agreed to testify as part of a plea deal for an ongoing felony identity theft case after repeatedly saying that she kept things casual with the married father , the prosecutor had her read out an email that she sent on march 7 , 2007 to an unnamed potential suitor where she put an end to that man 's advances because of @entity32			1
in the march 7 email she wrote saying that she could not see the man in question because ' a very good and best friend of mine has become much more than that , ' referring to @entity32			0
in a follow up to that same man , she expanded on it and said that even though they met online more than a year ago , ' just recently his reasoning and views changed and we are together now '			0
the prosecutor then went through the log of texts and calls that the pair exchanged , that ranged from anywhere between six and 38 texts in one day - even during the week of april 11 , 2007 when @entity59 was found dead			1
on that particular day , they exchanged 15 texts , and on april 14 they texted 22 times during @entity59 's funeral			1
the majority of the calls were made from @entity32 's office phone while the texts came from his cell - showing that he tried to keep his audible interactions with her hidden while at home with his wife and children			2
' this was a very informal , discrete thing			0
we were not interested in other people knowing			0
he was trying to keep it discrete			0
i respected that , ' @entity23 said			0
asked about the nature of the relationship she added : ' we had sex half the time			0
sometimes , it was just lunch			0
' friday 's appearance was @entity167 's first time taking the stand in the controversial murder trial , and she only spoke briefly about the circumstances around @entity59 's death			2
when asked what @entity32 had told her about the way in which his wife had died , she said : ' he found @entity59 in the bathtub			1
' ' i did n't chase him for details but i believe she was partially dressed , ' she said			0
plotted : prosecutors say @entity32 convinced his wife to get a facelift then drugged her and coaxed her into the tub , where she drowned @entity23 recalled two other potentially pivotal details , telling how she remembered an undated anecdote that @entity32 told her about how his wife had recently been told by doctors that she had high blood pressure			1
@entity23 also said that on the day of @entity59 's death , she remembered @entity32 telling her he had called one of his older daughters - @entity190 - and asked her to check in on her mother because @entity59 had seemed ' restless ' that morning			1
the secret lovers became less and less discrete after @entity59 's death , however , as @entity194 attended her funeral on april 14 and spoke to him briefly immediately after the service in front of family and friends			0
a tearful @entity201 , left , and her younger sister @entity202 , right , both testified in court against their father on thursday			0

@entity23 , now 37 , will return to the stand on tuesday			2
the prosecution is trying to prove a case that supports the theory that @entity32 killed his wife by using a combination of drugs following a plastic surgery operation in order to be with his mistress .			1
