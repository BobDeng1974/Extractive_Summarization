at first glance , this breathtaking shot looks like two brightly coloured flowers pictured next to each other			0
in fact , the photo is of a flower and a beautifully coloured hummingbird hovering beside it			1
with its wings outstretched , at first glance it 's almost impossible to tell the little bird is different from the flower			1
the only give - away is its small , thin , bill that peaks through its wings			2
the picture appears to be of two flowers , but one is a brightly coloured hummingbird hovering in the air the brightly coloured hummingbird was photographed sweeping down onto the pink flower so it could feed off its nectar			1
but while feeding peacefully , another bird invades and tries to get some of the nectar			1
after a few moments as the two birds sized each other up , the intruder decided to leave			0
the spectacular photos were taken by photographer @entity29 on the slopes of a volcano in @entity32			1
mr @entity29 visited the @entity33 , which is home to the volcano , to scout for locations good enough for his photo tours			1
the 32 - year - old , who is from @entity37 but lives in @entity32 , drove for an hour on a narrow mountain road before finding the hummingbirds			1
he said : ' i went there for location scouting for my photography workshops			0
i drove for one hour on a bumpy , narrow mountain pass			0
' i enjoyed a beautiful landscape and cold winds at the highest elevation , rain and heavy clouds are guests all year round and give the region a mystic atmosphere			0
' @entity55 - tailed hummingbirds are about 10cm from bill to tail			0
the flower about the size of a small honeydew melon			2
after hovering above it for some time , the hummingbird lands on the flower to try and look for nectar it then starts digging through the flower petals to try and find some food			1
the birds can consume up to twice their body weight in nectar every day before long , it is interrupted by a second hummingbird which hopes to join in the feast the two birds then have a brief confrontation as they fight over the rights to the flower 's nectar after the brief spat , the intruder decides to leave and the first hummingbird returns to its meal ' being from @entity37 i was not familiar with hummingbirds until my first journey to the @entity87 continent			1
' since then i was fascinated by this little helicopters designed by nature			0
their ability to stand still in the air and accelerate within a blink of an eye to 100km/h is aviational design in it 's perfection			2
' i like the pictures because of their colours and its unusual pose			2
' most hummingbird pictures are with the bird sipping nectar and the wings backwards while the hummer hovers in an upright position			1
' but the bird seemed to hug the flower			1
' even though the flower is disproportional to the bird , the picture looks balanced			2
i like the small details which my camera was able to capture			0
' he added that the birds were not shy and he managed to get four metres away from them whilst they battled over the flower			2
he said : ' the gardens are full of hummingbirds due to hummingbird feeders			0
when this happens there is competition between them			0
' so even if it looks like a ballet in the air , they were most probably fighting for the food source			0
' after their ' dance ' , the coppery - headed emerald took off and left the field .			0

*stunning* photograph captures hummingbird hovering in the air with wings open in a pose that *resembles* a flower
upon closer *inspection* , the bird can be *identified* by its beak , seen sticking out as it looks for nectar in the flower
