he has bowel cancer but plans to climb the @entity7 next year for charity a disabled pensioner who lost both his legs as a teenager has defied expectations by climbing more than 100 mountains			1
@entity1 , 72 , has scaled some of the world ’s most brutal peaks in ranges including the @entity7 and the @entity18			1
a keen climber from a young age , doctors told him he would have to sacrifice his hobby when , at the age of 19 , he had both his legs amputated after falling onto railway tracks into the path of an oncoming train			1
but despite warnings from friends and family , he refused to give up - and has spent the 53 years since taking on death - defying mountain climbs			1
the smallest ascent he has scaled was more than 8,200 feet tall - and he has even tackled a 26,000 - foot summit in the @entity18			1
despite recently been diagnosed with cancer , he has vowed to carry on			1
mr @entity36 , of @entity4 , @entity5 , who is now preparing himself for a charity expedition to the @entity7 , describes his hobby as an addiction			1
he said : ' climbing is an addiction			2
i say , life ’s like a muscle and if you do n’t stretch it , it ’ll waste away and climbing for me is like stretching the muscle of life			2
' it gives me something to aim for			0
i ’m going to be less active for a while , but i ’ll be okay for the trip next year			2
' mr @entity36 started climbing trees during his rehabilitation stint and as soon as he got his prosthetics he took to scaling the cliffs near his home on @entity57 's southern coast			2
death - defying : here he climbs a 17,880 - ft mountain in @entity59 , @entity60			0
the smallest he has scaled was 8,200ft passion : despite warnings from doctors , family and friends , he continued after losing his legs in 1960 beneficial : mr @entity36 says amputated legs are useful in climbing - less body heat to lose , less weight to lift accident : this picture of @entity1 , 17 , was taken two years before he was hit by an oncoming train the pensioner has now climbed mountains around the world including the @entity77 , the @entity78 and @entity79 in the @entity7 and the @entity80 in the @entity81			1
he can also add @entity82 in @entity83 and the sixth highest mountain in the world , @entity86 in @entity87 , to his impressive list of conquests			0
mr @entity36 said that not having any legs was n’t always a disadvantage and in some ways he felt it had helped him when climbing			1
he said : ' because there ’s less of me and i have a shorter blood circuit , i oxygenate better			0
' so i may be slower on the lower mountain but then among the first party at the top			0
' and because there ’s less body surface to lose heat from , i keep warmer as well so often i ’m more comfortable that the others			0
' and there are advantages on long distance flights too			0
' i can take my legs off and stretch out over two seats and have quite a good sleep			2
' @entity1 was awarded an obe for his work promoting adventurous sports for disabled people			1
he fought against those who held the view that only mainstream competitive sports were suitable for disabled people			0
all over the world : he has climbed towering rocks near @entity119 , @entity120 ( left ) , and @entity122 's @entity121 ( right ) rewarded : mr @entity36 received an obe for his support of disabled people in sport			0
he could not understand why amputees could n't climb world wonders everywhere from @entity60 's @entity128 ( left ) to @entity120 's cliffs ( right ) records : mr @entity36 , a retired social worker , was the first amputee to walk @entity132 to @entity133 in 1969 he went on to prove that sailing , tobogganing and zip wiring were all still accessible for those with disabilities			0
and in 1969 , he also became the first person fitted with artificial limbs to walk the 900 miles from @entity132 to @entity133			0
in june , with two friends , mr @entity36 will take on two or three 11,500 - ft peaks around @entity142 in the @entity143 @entity7 to raise funds for @entity145 .			0
