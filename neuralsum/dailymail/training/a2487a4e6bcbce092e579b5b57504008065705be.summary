published : 04:41 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 06:49 est , 7 january 2014 it would be better for @entity2 to be poorer but with fewer immigrants , @entity3 claimed today			1
the @entity2 @entity6 leader said he said he would ‘ rather we were n’t slightly richer ’ if it means allowing more people into the country to work and create jobs			1
but he also revealed his party does not have an official policy on immigration , although he spent ‘ many hours ’ yesterday discussing it			1
@entity6 leader @entity3 claimed immigration had not bought benefits for @entity2 and would prefer to curb the numbers moving to the @entity2 even if it makes the country poorer the government is under pressure after restrictions on @entity24 and @entity25 working in @entity2 were lifted at the start of the year			1
business secretary @entity27 sparked a fresh @entity29 rift on the issue , after he claimed @entity31 will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election			1
however , mr @entity3 today insisted that immigration had not been of net benefit to @entity2 and would rather fewer people moved here in future even if it left the country worse off			1
he told @entity40 ’s today programme : ‘ the fact is that if people come to this country from @entity46 and they ’re earning minimum wage , they ’re getting tax credits , possibly child tax credits , child benefit , housing benefit , and this so far has been the undiscussed part of this			2
so i question the economics			0
@entity31 will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election , @entity27 has declared			1
the @entity56 business secretary said the target was ‘ impractical ’ and the prime minister ‘ almost certainly wo n’t achieve ’ it by 2015			2
his intervention could spark a new round of @entity63 bloodletting – and comes only weeks after he accused mr @entity31 of behaving like @entity64			1
however , it also risked backfiring by exposing how out of touch the @entity56 are with public opinion on the issue			0
mr @entity27 made his comments in the documentary @entity70 , to be aired tonight on @entity71			2
the programme released a poll showing that more than three - quarters of the public want migrant numbers reduced , and more than half want them to be cut ‘ a lot ’			0
mr @entity27 said it was ‘ not sensible to have an arbitrary cap ’ on net migration – because many elements which make up the target can not be controlled			1
he said : ‘ so it involves @entity2 people emigrating – you ca n’t control that			2
it involves free movement within the @entity91 – in and out			0
‘ it involves @entity2 people coming back from overseas			2
‘ so setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful , it almost certainly wo n’t achieve the below 100,000 level the @entity96 have set , so let ’s be practical about it			0
’ ‘ the idea it should come down to 100,000 is something the @entity56 have never signed up to because we simply regard it as impractical			0
’ ‘ but if you said to me : “ would you want to see over the next ten years a further 5million people come into @entity2 and if that happened we ’d all be slightly richer ? ” i would say : actually , do you know what i ’d rather we were n’t slightly richer			1
‘ i ’d rather we had communities that felt more united and i ’d rather have a situation where young unemployed @entity2 people had a realistic chance of getting a job			2
‘ so yes , i do think the social side of this matters more than pure market economics			0
’ it comes as a new poll shows four out of ten @entity119 voters think immigration is bad for the economy , polling shows			0
the @entity124 poll found 40 per cent of @entity119 voters said it damaged growth			0
meanwhile , 22 per cent said it was neither good nor bad , and 36 per cent said it helped the economy			0
mr @entity3 insisted @entity2 can not have its own immigration policy while it remains a member of the @entity91			1
but he admitted that his own party , which wants thr @entity2 to leave the @entity91 , does not have an immigration policy either			1
‘ we spent many hours yesterday discussing it , ’ he admitted			0
‘ for example , how do you deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in @entity2 ? not everybody from politics can give you perfect solutions			2
we have something like 1m , maybe it ’s 2million , illegal immigrants in @entity2 – how do we find those people ? how do we deal with those problems ? ‘ what we can do very quickly is stop open doors ; what we can do is have proper border checks to stop people with criminal records coming to @entity2 – they ’re the things we can do			1
‘ but to have a total policy solution after the disaster that ’s engulfed us since @entity119 came to power in 1997 is no easy matter			0
’ net migration – the difference between the numbers arriving and leaving @entity2 – was below 100,000 during much of the 1990s before increasing sharply in 1998 under @entity119			1
from 2004 it was consistently above 200,000 and reached a peak of more than 250,000 in 2010			0
after @entity164 entered the @entity165 it fell to 153,000 by 2012 but rose to 182,000 in the 12 months to june last year , driven by arrivals from southern @entity46			0
the @entity167 pledged to reduce the total to under 100,000 by the time of the next election , but the @entity56 never signed up to the policy .			0

@entity2 @entity6 leader *denies* immigration has bought benefits
says he would rather the country was poorer than open doors to 5million
admits party does not have immigration policy but discussed it for ' hours '
@entity27 claims @entity31 will miss target to cut net migration
