by @entity0 published : 03:27 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 7 october 2013 @entity2 victims joined dozens of amputees to learn how to run with prosthetic legs , only six months after the bombing			1
@entity6 , who lost both legs in the explosions at the marathon finish line , joined amputees , their families , volunteers and physical therapists at the @entity15 athletic fields on a rainy sunday morning			1
wearing her yellow ‘ @entity17 ’ hat , ms @entity6 navigated her way across the artificial turf on her artificial legs , a volunteer on each arm to keep her upright			2
@entity24 no more : @entity6 ( centre ) , who lost both legs in the @entity27 , learns how to run with prosthetic legs with the help of @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 ( right ) who has a pair of prosthetic legs of his own one of her assistants had a pair of prosthetics of his own			2
@entity42 , pausing to choke back tears , said : ‘ i 've always wanted to be a runner but i used to get shin splints			2
‘ i do n't have shins anymore , so i 'm hoping			2
no obstacle too tough : amputee @entity47 smiles as she runs an obstacle course at the running clinic ‘ normally you walk around and you see everybody with two legs			1
especially in the summertime - all you see is legs			2
‘ it 's easy to miss yours but when i see everybody here walking and running , it 's ok			1
‘ i just want to be able to do the things that i did before			2
... so many people have my back , i feel like i can do it			1
i 'm trying my hardest to enjoy being alive			2
' dozens of amputees showed up at the @entity15 athletic fields on a rainy sunday morning to learn how to run - or run better - with prosthetic legs			1
@entity42 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , was n't much of a runner before , but she said she hopes that she will someday be able to join in a @entity73 or fun run			2
her daughter , @entity42 , 18 , is wearing a matching yellow hat along with ankle - length tights that showed the effects of the shrapnel that scarred her legs but did not require amputation			2
she was on @entity82 with her mother when the bombs went off , waiting for her aunt to finish the marathon			2
across the field , a boy with two prosthetic legs , no more than 4 - years - old , was learning to kick a soccer ball with the carbon fibre blades			1
two older boys wrestled playfully while the bigger one played keep - away with the younger 's prosthesis			2
two - time @entity2 winner @entity96 said at the start of the clinic : ‘ the most inspiring stories are at the back of the pack			1
‘ our motto is “ there is no finish line			2
” there are always more challenges out there			0
you people who came out today are the spokesmen for those challenges			1
’ organised by the @entity113 , which helps amputees and others with disabilities participate in sports , the clinic brought together marathon victims , those wounded in the military and other amputees			1
coach @entity122 ran them through a series of increasingly complicated drills , then lined them up for an obstacle course that was the highlight of the day			0
similarly skilled participants match up in a relay race			0
some runners fall ; others have trouble weaving through the cones or stepping around the ropes			0
one woman made her way through the lanes , saying aloud , with a smile : ‘ i 'm not going to fall this time			0
’ another wore a t - shirt that said : ‘ i am a @entity140			0
’ trying to do everyday things : @entity142 ( centre ) , who lost part of her left left in the explosions , has four prosthetics : an everyday leg , a waterproof one for swimming , another that allows her to wear high heels and this running one learn to run again : dozens of amputees turned up to the running clinic at the @entity15 athletic fields to learn how to run , or run better , using prosthetic legs ‘ it 's inspiring , ’ said @entity158 , a doctor who was working at the marathon 's finish line medical tent on race day			1
because his son , @entity163 , was born with an incomplete tibia and fibula , the elder @entity158 has also volunteered with the @entity113			0
he said : ‘ it 's very enlightening to see them coming and to see they 're overcoming that			0
it helps me , too , to work through it			0
‘ i do n't say , “ there , but for the grace of @entity173 , go i. ” i say , “ how can i be more like them			0
” ' many of those who lost legs on marathon day have been fitted for the heavy - duty prosthetics they call their everyday legs			0
running is easier with the carbon - fibre blades - the ‘ cheetah legs ’ made familiar by @entity184 , but insurance often does not cover them			1
' there is no finish line ' : two - time @entity2 winner @entity96 ( left ) with @entity142 ( right ) said that participants were inspiring the @entity192 , which previously provided prosthetics for victims of the 2010 earthquake in @entity196 , have helped marathon victims get running legs or other prosthetics that help them regain a normal life			1
@entity192 spokesman @entity202 said : ‘ we ca n't let evil have the last word and that 's why we focused on this group			0
’ for @entity142 , who had her left leg amputated after the marathon explosions that means four prosthetics : the everyday leg , a waterproof one for swimming , another that allows her to wear high heels , and the running leg she received saturday			1
@entity216 said : ‘ i 'm trying to do all the things i used to do			0
’ @entity218 , the prosthetic - maker , donated the blade that serves as @entity216 's new left foot			0
next step bionics and prosthetics took care of the rest of the prosthetics			0
the @entity113 helps with training , with clinics like the one at @entity15 on sunday			1
so many have my back : @entity6 ( centre ) with prosthetist @entity233 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) said she is trying hard to enjoy her life and do the things she did before the explosions next step president @entity237 said : ‘ you can have a running prosthesis sitting in the closet			1
you have to be trained on it to have its full benefit			0
‘ i ca n't tell you how great it is to provide these opportunities for people who never thought they were going to walk again to get out on the field			1
this is about making people feel good about themselves			1
’ @entity216 stopped midway through the clinic to take off her prosthetic and check for blisters ; everything was clear			1
putting the leg back on involves a sleeve and a sock and a release valve and some hand sanitizer that 's used as a lubricant to create a seal that holds the prosthesis in place			0
losing a leg is a self - evident setback and while it 's easy to see the damage to the limb it 's not always obvious what other problems might come with it			0
for @entity276 , who has spent much of the time since marathon monday on one crutch or a cane , it can be anything that she needs two hands for , like taking laundry out of the dryer or making a bed			0
marathon bombing : runners continue toward the finish line of the @entity2 as an explosion erupts in april this year , killing three and injuring more than 260 ms @entity276 , who lost her right leg above the knee , said her most recent problem was the emergence of blisters on her leg where it has been rubbing against the socket of her prosthetic			1
the sores prevented her from getting a running leg this week and left her little to do on sunday other than sit and watch the clinic , crutches at her side			1
she said : ‘ today was going to be the day			0
‘ i was excited to get it , because even if i only took two steps today , i 'd take three steps tomorrow			0
‘ but now , ’ she said , sitting under a canopy to stay out of the rain , ‘ i 'm back to @entity307 , waiting			0
’ two bombs were detonated near the finish line of the @entity2 on april 15 this year , killing three people and injuring more than 260			1
authorities say @entity319 and his older brother , @entity320 , 26 , ethnic chechens from @entity312 who emigrated to the @entity313 as children , planned and carried out the attack to retaliate against the @entity313 for its involvement in @entity318 countries			0
@entity320 was killed four days after the marathon following a gun battle with police			1
@entity319 was found wounded and hiding in a boat in a backyard in @entity326			0
authorities said he had scrawled anti-american messages on the inside of the boat , including ' the @entity313 government is killing our innocent civilians ' and ' we @entity318 are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all			0
' deadly attack : chaos unfolds at the finish line of the marathon in april and authorities say @entity319 and brother @entity320 planned and carried out the attack to retaliate against the @entity313 for its involvement in @entity318 countries			1
