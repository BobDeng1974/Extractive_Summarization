forget what the scoreboard says - wednesday was a good day for @entity2			1
the @entity4 pitch was one of the most lifeless i ’ve seen in this country for some time , but i thought @entity2 improved in all the areas that could have been asked of them			1
they caught well , especially the blinder held by @entity11 at silly mid-on to see off @entity13			2
their over rate was excellent			2
right direction : @entity17 and @entity18 ' should be pleased with what @entity2 delivered on day one classic catch : @entity22 races to congratulate @entity11 's take to dismiss @entity13 spectacular : @entity11 takes the ball in his fingertips at full stretch at silly mid-on @entity29 , who had a question mark over his glovework at @entity32 , was superb			1
@entity33 and @entity34 kept going on a lifeless pitch			1
and , perhaps most encouragingly of all , @entity17 had a very good day with his tactics			1
he was especially good after the two breaks : @entity13 and @entity38 fell shortly after lunch , with @entity17 setting a silly mid-on for @entity13 , while @entity41 departed just after tea			1
he realised the ball was reversing and set tight fields			2
and he did well to get a silly point into @entity41			0
i know that the catch he took was a little fortuitous , but a couple of balls earlier one had landed just short of him in the same position			0
@entity17 knew what he was doing			1
i also thought he rotated the bowlers well			2
given the conditions , there were a lot of good things happening			0
@entity57 puts @entity58 in control superb : @entity29 put in an excellent shift on day one after a questionable performance against @entity63 charging in : @entity34 and his fast bowling brothers kept charging in on a pitch that gave nothing back i also liked the way prior was urging his slip cordon to get up closer to the stumps because of the slowness of the surface			1
my only criticism was that @entity17 could have set a third man earlier than he did			1
on a pitch like this , @entity76 batsmen do n’t need a second invitation to open the face of their bats			0
and if you ’re only having one slip , you risk leaking a lot of runs			0
in terms of the pitch itself , i ’m not one to try to overdo home advantage			0
if the pitch had been covered with grass , for example , then it would have brought @entity58 ’s seamers into the game too			1
but a test pitch has got to have some carry in it			0
without carry , you risk losing the spectacle			0
the ball goes through at shin height , and a ring field can make run - scoring difficult			2
positive atmopshere : @entity17 ( second left ) shares a laugh with his team - mates after @entity107 's dismissal massive wicket : the wicket of @entity38 by @entity34 was largely thanks to @entity17 's critiqued captaincy @entity4 has often been flat			1
i remember @entity113 ’s side failing to take a wicket all day here in a test against @entity117 in 1989			1
but even that had a bit of bounce and carry in it			0
thankfully , @entity2 managed to get the ball to reverse yesterday			1
but if test cricket is going to survive and flourish , we need surfaces with something in them for everyone			0
as for @entity130 , he just reminds me of every other young @entity76 batsman i see these days			0
they all just know how to bat			0
you do n’t look at them and spot an obvious technical weakness , and they just make batting look so easy			0
he left very well as his innings developed , and this success - in his first test innings in @entity2 - will give him a lot of confidence as the series progresses			2
and if this pitch starts to show signs of uneven bounce as the game goes on , it could prove a mighty valuable knock .			0

@entity2 *toiled* in the field to have @entity58 *259* for 4 at stumps on day one
the lifeless @entity4 wicket has done @entity17 's bowlers no *favours*
@entity29 kept well while @entity34 and @entity33 were resilient
bold field placings from @entity17 claimed *key* wickets after lunch
