by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:36 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 11:06 est , 22 july 2013 a government scheme to help 160,000 young people get into work has so far reached just 4,600 , it emerged today			1
@entity7 ’s @entity6 promises to pay employers up to £ 2,275 for taking on an 18 to 24 - year - old who has been out of work for at least six months			1
but latest figures show that the wage incentives , claimed after someone has been in work for six months , have been paid for more than 4,690 young people			1
painting over the cracks : the @entity6 scheme was launched with great fanfare by @entity7 as a solution to rising numbers of under - 25s out of work mr @entity7 has admitted that government policy for young people has failed , complaining that millions of pounds have been wasted on a ‘ hotchpotch ’ of schemes which have failed to stem the tide of youth unemployment			1
the deputy prime minister has ordered a major review into @entity33 schemes which are supposed to get teenagers and people in their twenties into a job			0
wage incentives under the @entity6 have been paid to employers for more than 4,690 recruits between june 2012 and may 2013			1
ministers hoped it would help 160,000 young people find work over three years – equivalent to around 53,000 people each year			0
the @entity45 insisted the scheme ‘ has encouraged @entity47 businesses to offer over 21,000 jobs to young people at risk of long - term unemployment ’			1
employment minister @entity53 insisted the government was ' not complacent ' most of the incentive payments are only made once the employee has been in work for six months			0
the @entity45 claimed more than 21,000 jobs have been offered to young people at risk of long - term unemployment under the @entity62 wage incentive scheme			1
employment minister @entity53 said : ‘ youth unemployment has fallen by 59,000 since the @entity6 was launched and tens of thousands of people have benefited from work experience , apprenticeships or the wage incentive			2
‘ through the different elements of the @entity6 , this government is delivering on our commitment to offer young people the best chance to get on in life , but we 're not complacent about the scale of the challenge still facing us			2
’ the @entity45 said take - up of the incentive got off to a slow start , but is now on a ‘ clear upwards trajectory ’			0
but @entity81 general secretary @entity80 said : ‘ it is far too early for the government to be hailing the @entity6 a success			2
‘ closer reading of today 's figures show that of the 7,810 people who started on this scheme 26 weeks or more ago , only 2,870 found long - term jobs			1
in other words , 63 per cent of those who started left employment before six months			0
‘ there is also still a huge issue with employer take - up			0
research published last month shows that nearly one in three of firms are still not aware of this initiative , and of those that are , fewer than one in five intend to make use of it			0
’ @entity106 queues : the number of people aged 18 - 14 who are unemployed has risen by 50 per cent in five years latest figures show that from march to may this year there were 3.63 million 16 to 24 year olds in employment , down 31,000 from december 2012 to february 2013			1
@entity113 , @entity115 ’s shadow work and pensions secretary @entity113 said : ‘ @entity116 has utterly failed to get our young people back to work			0
‘ this flagship scheme is on course to miss its target by more than 92 % - no wonder there are still almost a million young people out of work			2
‘ the welfare revolution we were promised has fallen apart			0
@entity128 does n't work , @entity129 is disappearing into the sunset , and now we know that the @entity6 has been a disaster			0

@entity6 pays employers £ 2,275 for taking on 18 - 24 - year - olds
