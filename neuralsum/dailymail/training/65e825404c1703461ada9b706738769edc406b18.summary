once regarded as harbingers of doom , fiery meteors are believed to strike the @entity3 at complete random			2
but a new study into impact trends suggests meteor strikes are more likely to occur at certain times of the year and at certain locations			0
the @entity10 study found that the frequency of impacts was higher when @entity3 's orbit took it through streams of meteoroids created by the break - up of a comet			1
the @entity18 ( pictured ) was caused by a near - @entity3 asteroid that entered @entity3 's atmosphere over @entity21 on 15 february 2013			2
scientists now believe events such as this are not as random as once thought most of the meteors analysed as part of the research also hit the @entity3 in the second half of the year , according to the @entity31			1
' this lack of randomness is induced by planetary perturbations , in particular @entity35 's , and suggests that some of the recent , most powerful @entity3 impacts may be associated with resonant groups of @entity39 and / or very young meteoroid streams , ' the study claims			2
planets and moon can affect meteors , pushing them into orbits called ' resonant streams '			0
researchers looked at 33 multi-kiloton impact events from 2000 to 2013 that were detected by infrasound acoustic pressure sensors			1
most of the meteors analysed as part of the research hit the @entity3 in the second half of the year , according to the @entity31			2
pictured is the part of the large meteor that hit @entity21 in 2013 in the southern hemisphere , june is the most likely month for a meteor to hit the @entity3 , while september and october were the least likely			1
north of the equator , november is the most likely month for a meteor hit , while may and june were the least likely			1
the study found that 17 impacts took place in the northern hemisphere and 16 in the south			1
the sensors are designed to detect secret nuclear tests , but also pick up meteor impacts with when they have an explosive energy in excess of a thousand tonnes of @entity69			0
they found 17 impacts took place in the northern hemisphere and 16 in the south			1
of these impact , 25 took place within 40 degrees north or south of the equator , while eight took place at higher latitudes			1
twenty impacts across the second half of the year were recorded compared to just 13 hits in the first six calendar months â€“ a 21 per cent difference in timing			0
in the southern hemisphere , june was the most likely month for a meteor to hit the @entity3 , while september and october were the least likely			1
in the southern hemisphere , june was the most likely month for a meteor to hit the @entity3 ( artist 's impression pictured ) , while september and october were the least likely overall , 12 meteor impacts took place in the second half of the year compared to four in the first six months			1
north of the equator , november was the most likely month for a meteor hit while may and june were the least likely			1
nine meteors hit @entity3 in the first half of the year and eight in the second half			1
' what we had always assumed up until this paper , was that meteor impacts were random , occurring at any time and in any place , ' dr @entity97 of the @entity98 told @entity105			0
but more data is needed			0
' it 's a very interesting paper , but 33 events is a statistically small sample range , ' said dr @entity97			0
collision course : @entity112 shows the number of asteroids striking @entity3 's atmosphere over a 20 year period a flash of light from a fiery asteroid is often treated with intrigue when it is spotted on @entity3			2
but scientists at @entity122 suggest that asteroids are smashing into the @entity3 's atmosphere at a higher rate than most people realise			2
according to a new map by the space agency , it 's a wonder we do n't see fireballs raining down from the skies more frequently			0
the map from the space agency 's @entity39 , reveals that more than 556 space rocks smashed into the atmosphere over a 20 - year period between 1994 and 2013			0
the orange dots on the diagram show the frequency of asteroids that hit locations during the day while the blue dots show those that hit at night			0
they are measured in billions of @entity143 ( gj ) of energy			0
most space rocks were small and harmless and disintegrated when they hit the atmosphere			0
last year on february 15 , an asteroid which was 55 feet in diameter with a mass of up to 10,000 tons crashed to earth in the @entity154 region in @entity21 .			0

study looked at 33 major meteor impact events between 2000 to 2013
@entity159 was higher when @entity3 's orbit took it through meteoroids
*slightly* more meteors tend to hit the @entity3 in the second half of year
17 impacts took place in the northern hemisphere and 16 in the south
25 impact events took place within 40 degrees north or south of equator
in southern hemisphere , june is most likely month for a meteor to hit
november is most likely month for meteors to hit northern hemisphere
