@entity10 , near the village of @entity9 , boasts 40 bedrooms and was for decades used as a youth hostel which attracted thousands of holidaymakers			1
the grand residence - completed in 1917 - sits on a picturesque hillside not far from the @entity16 , a body of water famous for its salmon fishing			1
up for sale : @entity23 , near the @entity22 village of @entity9 , is on the market for £ 1.2million prospective buyers will have to shell out to complete vital refurbishment to the stunning building @entity27 : the 40 - bedroom castle was finished in 1917 and was once a bustling youth hostel			1
but it was ravaged by water damage in 2010 and 2011			2
the statues pictured have now been removed prospective guests would have to make their way up a single - track road to reach the castle 's stone - built gates and broad courtyards			2
@entity39 , an estate agent with @entity40 said : ' i 've seen a lot of fine buildings in my time , but this one really makes an impression			0
the size of it and the detail in some of the rooms just takes your breath away			0
' there are six main rooms and the decorations are beautiful			0
and it 's biggest saving grace is that the train stops at the end of the drive			0
you can walk the half a mile or so from the station			0
' inside , as well the 40 bedrooms , the castle boasts a ballroom , a grand hall , a billiards room , a dining room and a drawing room - all of which were not harmed by the water damage and boast intricate masonry			1
remote : the large castle , bottom , is perched on a hillside in the @entity76 , not far from the @entity16 the building was once a thriving tourist attraction , which entertained some 20,000 guests a year the building was once a thriving tourist attraction , which entertained some 20,000 guests a year , but it was forced to close in 2011 after a spate of bad weather and water damage			1
a rough winter saw feet of snow pile up on the castle 's roof			2
when the warmer weather returned and the snow and ice melted , it rushed into the house , causing millions of pounds of damage			2
the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) - which is now trying to sell the property - spent more than £ 2million attempting to repair the damage			2
architecture : the 40 - bedroom property ( pictured left from the front ) was damaged by water , but many of the grander rooms have escaped harm but financial pressures mean that the organisation is looking to dispose of the castle to spend its money elsewhere			2
in the wake of the repairs , beds , furniture and the kitchens were all stripped out			0
but mr @entity39 says it would be essential to sell the property to somebody who wished to keep making commercial use out of it			0
remaining repairs and refurbishment are likely to extend into the millions , he told @entity119 , but the castle could once again be viable as a @entity76 hotel			1
indeed , a @entity3 government body has hinted that it may award a grant to anybody who wishes to pay out for further repairs			0
remote : carbisdale castle is in a distant part of the @entity128 - but has train links to @entity130 and the rest of the country in his statement , @entity93 boss @entity133 said the organisation was selling the castle ' with regret ' because it could not find the funding to finish the refurbishment			1
mr @entity133 said the castle had not generated enough surplus income to allow for reinvestment			2
he continued : ' the recent partial refurbishment and ongoing running costs already incurred , coupled with the extensive funds necessary to complete the refurbishment of the castle , makes it financially unsustainable to operate the property as a youth hostel in the long term			1
' as a not - for - profit and self funding charitable organisation , @entity93 has a duty to make best use of scarce resources			2
' in exile : king @entity159 of @entity160 , pictured , took refuge in @entity10 while @entity162 was occupying his country the grand @entity22 residence was built between 1905 and 1917 for @entity165 , @entity166 , the second wife of @entity167 , 3rd @entity168			1
the two married in 1889 , six years after the @entity170 ’s first husband died in a hunting accident			0
but the marriage incensed the @entity168 ’s family – and when he died his heirs contested the will , which left much of the family ’s property to the new duchess			0
the acrimonious battle saw the @entity166 thrown in prison for six weeks for destroying evidence			0
as part of the settlement the @entity168 ’s sons were forced to build the @entity166 a home – and rumour has it she picked the prominent hillside location to make it as visible as possible to her disgruntled relatives			0
in a further twist of the knife , she told the builders to only install clocks on three of the four faces of the castle			0
the aspect pointing towards her estranged family in @entity200 has no visible clock – as she did n’t want to give them to time of day			0
@entity10 changed hands in the 1930s when it was bought by a @entity3 army colonel with @entity160 ancestry			1
he offered his home up as a safe haven to @entity159 of @entity160 and crown prince @entity210 – later @entity211 – when they were exiled in the @entity212			1
from @entity10 the exiled rulers struck a deal with @entity215 , allowing them to enter the country to rout @entity162 ’s forces , but demanding that they leave afterwards			1
in october 1944 the agreement came true when the @entity219 stormed through @entity160 , but later withdrew and allowed the country to flourish			1
after the last remaining owner died in the mid- 1940s , at which point it was given to the @entity93 , who ran it until its 2011 closure .			0
