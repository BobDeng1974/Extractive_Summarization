the charity , which has raised more than £ 600million for youngsters in the @entity9 since 1980 , is preparing to launch a fresh appeal to viewers next month			2

another £ 2.2million is sitting in its bank accounts , up from £ 864,000 last year			1
the accounts reveal it paid £ 9,000 in fees to fund managers and made £ 893,000 in investment income			2

the money is used to help charities that support disadvantaged and disabled children around the country			0
yesterday , the @entity2 insisted all of the money it raises is given to charity , but said it does not release all of it at once so it is able to measure the impact of its donations and ensure funds are being put to good use			1
a spokesman said : ‘ this money is not simply cash			2
it has been allocated to projects working with disadvantaged children and young people throughout the @entity9			0
‘ in line with standard grant - making practice we do not typically release the full grant upon successful application from projects but rather over a three - year period on a quarterly basis so we can monitor projects to ensure that they continue to comply to the terms and conditions of the grant			0
’ in 2008 the @entity2 faced the prospect of an investigation by the @entity78 after keeping more than £ 100,000 which should have been given to charity			1

the cash was generated by callers voting after phone lines had closed on about 20 shows , believed to include @entity102 and @entity103 , between october 2005 and september 2007			0
they were still charged for their calls , typically around 25p a time , but the cash went into the bank account of @entity109 , the corporation ’s commercial arm , rather than the charities			0

the @entity2 has said the ‘ small number ’ of staff involved face disciplinary action			2
in 2006 tv viewers were warned against giving money to the @entity2 ’s @entity2 appeal			1
an independent watchdog said donating to the charity is ‘ a bad idea ’ because of its huge administration costs – £ 2.4million out of a total of £ 33million raised at the time			2
@entity133 said money is swallowed up by the need for two sets of bureaucrats : those who run the charity and those in charge of the organisations to which it gives money .			0
