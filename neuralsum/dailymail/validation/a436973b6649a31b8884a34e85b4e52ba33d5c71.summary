@entity0 engine : @entity0 44 @entity2 age : 29 @entity5 : 166 wins : 8 @entity2 has got the confidence , but we do know that he can be fragile — his gaffe during qualifying for the @entity3 @entity5 last year is a good example			1
@entity7 has a lot to prove , but he will undoubtedly learn from his mistakes			2
he will come back stronger			2
@entity7 drives the new @entity0 car during testing at the @entity18 in @entity19 on march 1 @entity20 engine : @entity22 3 @entity23 ( @entity24 ) age : 25 @entity5 : 69 wins : 3 26 @entity27 ( @entity28 ) age : 20 @entity5 : 19 wins : 0 new @entity20 driver @entity27 takes the 2015 car round the track in @entity33 during a filming day @entity35 engine : @entity0 19 @entity37 ( @entity38 ) age : 33 @entity5 : 212 wins : 11 77 @entity41 age : 25 @entity5 : 38 wins : 0 the flair and experience of @entity37 is balanced by the steely determination of @entity41 , who i expect to lead the charge to @entity0 on a consistent basis			1
@entity37 is a great character and i hope he gets some good results , such as his pole position in @entity53 last year			2
@entity37 takes the @entity35 for a spin during testing in @entity33 at the end of february @entity57 engine : @entity57 5 @entity59 ( @entity8 ) age : 27 @entity5 : 139 wins : 39 7 @entity62 ( @entity63 ) age : 35 @entity5 : 213 wins : 20 there is less pressure on @entity59 because it is a fresh challenge			1
it is the first time he has flown the nest and i expect to see him develop			2
@entity62 was fantastic at races in 2013 but at the same events last year he was nowhere			2
the car will be better and i hope it gives him what he needs			0
@entity59 has moved from @entity20 to @entity57 for the 2015 season @entity77 engine : @entity79 14 @entity80 ( @entity81 ) age : 33 @entity5 's 236 wins : 32 22 @entity84 ( @entity3 ) age : 35 @entity5 's 268 wins : 15 all team bosses nominated @entity80 as the driver they would want , but he clearly has problems			1
keeping @entity84 was right , too , but the car is not where it needs to be			0
they finished fifth in 2014 with the best engine but have changed to @entity79 , so my gut says they will not improve			0
@entity97 's @entity84 drives the new @entity79 powered @entity77 at testing this month @entity98 engine : @entity0 27 @entity100 ( @entity8 ) age : 27 @entity5 : 77 wins : 0 11 @entity103 ( @entity104 ) age : 25 @entity5 : 77 wins : 0 @entity100 is one of the stars but he has not been in the environment to win races , and i do n’t know if he ’ll achieve that at @entity98			1
last year @entity103 outshone him			0
@entity100 needs to be dominant if he wants to join a big team like @entity103 did at @entity77			0
@entity98 's @entity103 puts the car through its paces at the @entity18 @entity115 engine : @entity22 55 @entity117 ( @entity81 ) age : 20 @entity5 : 0 wins : 0 33 @entity120 ( @entity121 ) age : 17 @entity5 : 0 wins : 0 it is the youngest driver pairing in @entity126 history , but i like it			1
with greater experience , @entity117 is who you would expect to lead the team , but i think we are going to get a big surprise from @entity134 he hardly made a mistake in testing , does n’t miss apexes or lock brakes and looks in control			0
@entity115 's 17 - year - old rookie @entity120 tests the new car earlier this month @entity141 engine : @entity0 8 @entity143 ( @entity144 ) age : 28 @entity5 : 64 wins : 0 13 pastor @entity147 ( @entity148 ) age : 29 @entity5 : 77 wins : 1 i ’m a big @entity143 fan , but the car was not very good last year and he struggled			1
if the team can deliver on performance — they have changed from @entity22 to @entity0 engines — we will see him up there			1
pastor can deliver but he also crashes			0
he must reduce those incidents			0
pastor @entity147 tests the new @entity141 car at the circuit on the outskirts of @entity33 @entity165 engine : @entity57 9 @entity167 ( @entity168 ) age : 24 @entity5 : 16 wins : 0 12 @entity171 ( @entity38 ) age : 22 @entity5 : 0 wins : 0 a new driver line - up , with @entity175 and @entity176 leaving			1
@entity167 failed to set the world alight at @entity178 in 2014 , while @entity179 rookie @entity171 battled for last year ’s gp2 championship			0
each brings £ 12m in sponsorship to the cash - strapped outfit			0
@entity171 , who will be making his @entity126 debut , tests the new @entity165 @entity186 engine : @entity57 - @entity188 ( @entity3 ) age : 23 @entity5 : 1 wins : 0 will @entity188 has got his chance but the big story here is that the team are on the grid and that really makes me smile			1
i am very pleased for all the guys there because they are racers with real passion			0
why not give @entity200 a chance alongside the former @entity178 driver ? he would be exactly the type of character that @entity186 needs			2
the @entity126 season kicks off with the @entity206 gp on sunday , march 15			1
watch highlights on @entity208 at 13.15 , listen live on radio 5 live and follow all the action on the @entity212 website .			0

the 2015 @entity126 season starts next sunday with the @entity206 @entity5
@entity2 and @entity0 will be hoping they can retain their titles
