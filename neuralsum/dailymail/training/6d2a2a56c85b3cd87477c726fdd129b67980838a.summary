@entity0 is set to launch a launch a new subscription music service that take on @entity3 and others			1
the service will offer access to over 20 million tracks , along with concert footage and remixes , along with videos			1
according to @entity12 police , the service will supposedly also offer a free 30 day trial and will cost $ 9.99 per month thereafter			1
@entity0 's new subscription music service will take on @entity3 and others			2
@entity0 has reached deals with all three major music labels — @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 — and many independent labels as a whole representing about 95 percent of all labels , the people said			1
determining which artists are blocked — and where — could be confusing because some indie artists have their music distributed in certain countries by the major labels			2
@entity31 , for instance , is signed with @entity33 's @entity32 in the @entity34 , but @entity19 's @entity36 label distributes her music in the @entity38 ' @entity0 is set to launch a service called @entity41 , and @entity42 is set to rebrand @entity43 to @entity44 , ' the site claims			1
' specifically , it looks like @entity41 will offer ad - free music , audio - only playback ( for background or screen - off listening ) , and offline playback			0
' the company has been locked in a major row with independent artists over the plans			1
the company acknowledged the plans after being dragged into a public dispute over royalties that will result in the blockade of some independent artists ' music videos			1
the @entity42 owned video site said in a statement that it is ' adding subscription - based features for music on @entity0 ' and that ' hundreds of major label and independent artists ' have signed on			1
the paid service , to be launched within a few months , will likely allow playback of videos without ads and allow for offline playback on mobile devices			0
that 's according to two people familiar with the matter			0
the people were n't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity			0
@entity31 , who is signed with @entity33 's @entity32 in the @entity34 , but @entity19 's @entity36 label in the @entity38 could see her music banned from @entity0 in some territories over the deal			1
the people also confirmed that a small number of independent artists who had not agreed to new deal terms will have their videos blocked in some countries starting in a few days , even on the free version of @entity0			1
@entity0 will block the music videos so users of the test version wo n't be confused about which content they can access for free and with features require payment , the people said			2
allowing free streams of music by certain artists while not offering them on the paid service would erode the value of the paid plan , one person said			0
the move also adds pressure on those labels to sign , because not being on @entity0 altogether will result in less advertising revenue and exposure			2

independent labels are being offered the same per - stream royalty payment as the major labels , but are not offered the same guarantees or advances for the first year			0
@entity131 , president of the @entity132 , an industry group representing independent labels , said he disagrees with the characterization that only a few labels have n't signed			0
he argued that independent artists are being treated unfairly simply because they lack market power			1
' i 'm not very happy , obviously , ' he said			0
' we 're asking to be treated equitably and fairly			0
' one person familiar with the terms said that independent labels are being offered the same per - stream royalty payment as the major labels , but are not offered the same guarantees or advances for the first year			0
@entity142 , ceo of the @entity143 , another trade group representing indie labels , said in a statement that @entity0 's decision to blockade some labels was a ' grave error of commercial judgment			0
' she said services like @entity3 and @entity153 have done a better job representing independent music on their platforms			0
@entity158 chief executive , @entity157 said : ' we think it is wrong for @entity0 / @entity42 to threaten to ostracise certain independents - denying fans the opportunity to hear their music , and labels and artists the chance to earn a living from it - because they are unwilling to surrender to a take it or leave it ultimatum			2
' as the dominant online video platform , @entity0 / @entity42 should negotiate fully and fairly with independents and not misuse its power			0
