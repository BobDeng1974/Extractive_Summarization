the room was dimly lit , but even in the gloom i spotted him immediately , languidly propped up against the bar in his black tie , more handsome than any man has a right to be , surrounded by beautiful girls			0
they parted like the @entity11 as i walked up to him , my darling gorgeous boyfriend			2
i ’d spent hours getting ready : big hair perfectly tousled , red lipstick slicked on ; short gold frock i ’d broken the bank to buy			0
he smiled , took my hand and said : ‘ look at you			2
‘ your hair ’s all over the place , your mouth is too wide and your nose is too big			2
and much as i ’m ashamed to say it , i was grateful too			0
after all , it seemed scarcely believable that someone as fabulous as him could love someone as insignificant as me			0
we did n’t have a name for his behaviour back in the @entity40 , but today we do			0
it ’s called ‘ negging ’ — an extraordinary seduction ‘ technique ’ based on criticism , hurtfulness and downright rudeness			1
according to the @entity46 , an online dictionary of common slang , ‘ @entity48 ’ are ‘ low - grade insults meant to undermine the self - confidence of a woman so she might be more vulnerable to advances ’			1
‘ @entity54 ’ has become big business			1
seminars , blogs and online forums all purport to teach men how to ‘ neg ’ women into bed , working on the extraordinary premise that insulting and knocking her down will make her more malleable and willing			1
and that then throwing her a kind word or a scrap of love , like chucking a bone to a starving dog , is the most psychologically effective means of making a woman want a man			0
according to the @entity46 , an online dictionary of common slang , ‘ @entity48 ’ are ‘ low - grade insults meant to undermine the self - confidence of a woman so she might be more vulnerable to advances ’ ( stock picture ) it is , i suppose , the modern version of the horrible maxim ‘ treat them mean , keep them keen ’			1
and i am ashamed to say it worked for that long - ago boyfriend — and , to my utter horror , looks like it will continue to work for the next generation , too			2
my boyfriend was an artful and instinctive negger long before it became what it is now — an international movement and supposed ‘ artform ’ , practised by self - styled ‘ pick - up artists ’ ( @entity97 ) who learn at the feet of so - called gurus such as @entity101			1
barred from these shores earlier this month by home secretary @entity104 after an online petition was signed by 150,000 people , @entity102 - born @entity101 is the deeply misogynistic @entity108 - based negger who exists at the extreme end of the @entity97 movement and charges men $ 3,000 ( £ 2,000 ) to learn the dark arts of female manipulation at boot camps			1
@entity101 is the first person to be banned from @entity116 for sexist behaviour the general technique , seduction as subjugation , has gained a frighteningly large following , and demands that we ask why many modern men regard it with such disgusting glee			1
blanc himself admits of his teachings : ‘ it ’s offensive			2
but it ’s damn effective			0
’ when i first heard about ‘ negging ’ in the wake of the furore surrounding @entity101 , i talked to my girlfriends , and many shamefacedly confessed to having been on the receiving end of such behaviour , as young women and into middle age			1
one said she was recently approached by a nice - looking , slightly podgy man in the local pub , who piped up : ‘ you ’re brave wearing skinny jeans			1
’ then : ‘ i ’m really turned on by big women			1
’ she ’s a size 14			2
she replied : ‘ sadly for you , i ’m not turned on by middle - aged idiots			2
’ @entity27 says she was recently approached by a man who told her he loved big women at least as older women , if insults still get chucked at us , we are more likely to be equipped to hit back			1
but it ’s different for younger women , who seem much more susceptible to the @entity97 ’s contemptuous subliminal message			2
and that message is one that ultimately aims to shatter self - confidence			0
after all , say psychologists , a woman who feels ‘ imperfect ’ almost always demands less from a partner			1
low self - esteem leads to a craving for approval			0
it may all be a tawdry and disgusting game to the ‘ neggers ’ , but such behaviour has its roots in credible psychology			1
how often have i listened to my friends ’ daughters agonising over the casual if not callous way a boy is treating her			2
the agony of waiting for a text , the disappearance after sex , the insecurity , the way young men build them up just to knock them down			0
but that ’s the ‘ neg ’ technique			1
young people are quite cruel in the dating game			0
they commit and marry a decade later than we did , so have a lot of time to play the field and to wreak havoc in it			0
in today ’s dating landscape , the horrid practice of rating the opposite sex on a one - to - ten scale seems ‘ normal ’ and widespread			1
the basic principle here is that you ca n’t date a person who is three points higher than you — which is where ‘ negging ’ comes in			1
the six boy gets a ten girl in his sights and the only way to have sex with her is to make her feel like a three			0
by devaluing her she becomes within his reach			0
in the process he makes a clever young woman feel like a loser — and a bewilderingly large number of today ’s girls seem to embrace that feeling with something akin to martyrdom			0
why do they have such low self - esteem ? part of the problem lies within the existence of @entity228 and @entity229			0
the virtual world is doing half the neggers ’ work for them			2
every thought , action and encounter , is accompanied by a constant and often cruel online commentary that they ’re not good enough , clever enough or slim enough			0
and as a result , in some strange way , they ’ve become addicted to being put down			0
there were certainly neggers on the scene when i was a girl , but we were n’t such easy prey			0
where young people today are in contact at all hours of the day and night , we spoke to boys on the landline telephone — how quaint ! — for no more than a few minutes at a time			0
we made our own clothes			0
now girls have to look cool , wear the right designers , be gorgeous , be funny , and conform to a rigid set of suffocating ‘ norms ’			1
and it erodes their self - confidence			0
just as it does dating a boy who ’s obsessed with internet porn , for example , and who expects female bodies to look like the ones on the screen			0
or to be immersed in a teen culture where pop stars promote sexual availability , skinniness , and an unattainable fantasy of what a young woman is really like or should be			0
‘ pick - up artist ’ @entity101 , right , with @entity274			1
he was banned from entering the country and the @entity97 , the despicable @entity276 of this world , exploit that vulnerability			1
the @entity97 culture really kicked off more than a decade ago with the bestselling book @entity281 , by @entity282			0
it claimed to penetrate the secret society of pick - up artists , offering techniques and strategies with one sole purpose — having sex with women , then ditching them			2
it does n’t take too much surfing of @entity101 ’s ‘ manosphere ’ — the informal network of blogs and websites set up by men in opposition to feminism — to realise that it is populated by a bunch of nerdy losers			1
home secretary @entity104 banned @entity101 after an online petition was signed by 150,000 people hopeless , hapless men who feel lost in a world of accomplished young women			1
they feel emasculated , like spare parts , and the only way of hitting on women is to knock them down to their own size			2
indeed , i ’d heartily recommend that every young woman reads one of these obnoxious sites to see exactly what they ’re up to			0
try @entity318 , perhaps , which claims to offer ‘ advice ’ to loser men			1
some of it is too vulgar to be repeated in a family newspaper , but its ethos is summed up by @entity325 , the ‘ seduction guru ’ who runs the site			1
‘ this should be a mantra in your head every time you see a woman that stirs your loins			2
“ she just wants to be bent over and have her hair pulled ! ” ’ any woman who ’s visited the site should be able spot the signs she is being ‘ negged ’ — before running a mile .			1

@entity27 was flattered when a boyfriend told her he *disliked* her appearance
‘ @entity54 ’ is an extraordinary seduction ‘ technique ’ based on criticism
@entity101 who *degrades* women was recently banned from the country
