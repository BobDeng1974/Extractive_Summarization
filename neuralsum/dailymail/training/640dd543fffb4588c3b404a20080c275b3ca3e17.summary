by @entity0 @entity1 was dismissed by @entity2 before lasting a mere five months at @entity3			1
it ’s a record which fails to inspire @entity6 supporters			1
yet @entity7 baulks at the notion that the latest bookmakers ’ favourite to succeed @entity11 is somehow damaged goods			1
‘ i would n’t describe him as that , ’ said the @entity14 attacker , an intermittent presence in the @entity3 team when @entity1 was in charge			1
dismissed : @entity1 , linked with @entity6 , lasted just five months before being sacked by @entity3 ‘ i think damaged goods is a harsh phrase to use			1
i could n’t tell you the ins and outs - but i think he was close to getting the @entity6 job when he was at @entity25 and that ’s probably the reason why he ’s being mentioned again			1
’ there may be more to it than that			2
in @entity33 – the homeland of @entity6 ’s major shareholder @entity32 - significant sums are changing hands			1
sources close to @entity1 dismiss the markets and say talk of a meeting with @entity32 is misplaced			1
more than one candidate who was led to believe he would be granted a meeting with the billionaire has been left gazing at their phone in recent days			2
following two spells at @entity46 and one under the former @entity48 striker at the @entity49 , @entity7 should be well placed to offer a compatibility assessment of @entity1 and @entity6 , but admits to being a lousy judge in the past			1
‘ i worked with a really good man and someone i thought would be a really good @entity6 manager - and that was @entity57 , ’ grimaced @entity7			1
‘ so i ’m not sure if i could say who would be good for it or not			2
‘ that did n’t work out pretty quickly			2
i did n’t play too many times for him but when i did play i liked him as a person and his style of football			2
’ former @entity67 : frontman @entity7 insists @entity1 is not damaged goods following his @entity3 spell the @entity3 star can say the same of @entity1			1
he liked the @entity71 greatly , praising the bond he forged with his players			2
at @entity74 , then @entity25 , @entity1 built a reputation as the coming man of @entity78 football			1
but when @entity6 came calling in 2009 , he opted to remain in @entity79 – a decision many @entity46 supporters believe should invalidate his renewed interest this time around			1
got on well : @entity7 worked under @entity1 at @entity3 last season to say the @entity6 fanbase shows a lack of enthusiasm for @entity1 ’s candidature would be understating things			1
many are positively vitriolic on the subject			2
yet @entity7 says that ’s unfair on a man who was once one of the hottest managerial properties in the @entity78 game			1
‘ it ’s a difficult one with him losing his job at our place and at @entity2 , ’ said the 31 - year - old			0
‘ i can see why there are questions			0
but it ’s harsh to try to judge someone before they even get the job			0
but that ’s just football			0
‘ it ’s the same with players			0
it ’s a results business and that ’s fine			0
you know when you go into management that if you win games you will be fine			0
‘ he had a brilliant reputation and got the @entity2 job and he has n’t done so well at our club			0
‘ so he ’s on the other side of things at the moment , but that might not last forever			0
he could get his next job and do very well			0
’ @entity7 may be right			1
yet even as he tried his best to provide backing and support for his former boss he also contrived to provide more reasons for caution amongst supporters			2
‘ i ’ve been involved in situations with a change of manager at club level a few times			0
i was n’t actually there the last few weeks before @entity1 lost his job at @entity3 because i was in @entity134 for treatment			1
‘ @entity136 came in and there has been a huge turnaround in our fortunes			1
we were n’t good enough to get past @entity141 in the play - offs , which was fair , but the change under the new manager has been pretty colossal really			0
’ as recommendations for @entity1 go , it ’s hardly ringing			1
yet it states a bald truth			0
since @entity1 left and the @entity149 came in , @entity3 have thrived and prospered , enjoying a strong second half of the season			1
@entity7 is at a loss as to why @entity1 could n’t emulate @entity153 or @entity136 , but suggested it was n’t for the want of trying			1
‘ he definitely tried to cultivate a really good relationship with the players , that was his biggest idea			0
that ’s the way he tries to manage the club			0
‘ his assistant @entity160 did the bulk of the coaching – that ’s the way the two worked			0
‘ in fairness , it was difficult for him when he came in because we had a very different style of manager and style of football before him than the club had been used to for four years			0
‘ we had just been relegated and lost some of our best players – and i think he had to sign a lot as well , so it was n’t the easiest start he had			0
it was a tough job for him			0
’ experienced : @entity1 has also managed @entity2 and @entity25 in the @entity177 for many , however , there is a question to be answered			2
if it was difficult managing a team in a town of 50,000 with modest expectations , how might he cope at @entity6 ? ‘ @entity3 do n’t really have too many press requirements , ’ added @entity7			1
‘ the @entity6 job is at the other end of that scale			2
‘ you ’re dealing with hundreds of thousands , maybe millions of fans worldwide and there ’s a new level of expectancy of winning trophies			0
‘ @entity3 are now faced with the expectancy of being in the top six of the @entity196 - and we do n’t feel intensity in the town the way it is in @entity201			2
that ’s the polar opposite			0
‘ in @entity201 , particularly with the two bigger teams , that ’s just the main focus for people in @entity201			0
‘ there are not many jobs down south , apart from the top six or seven , would stand you in good stead for @entity6			1
’ back in the @entity14 squad to face @entity211 for the first time since he scored the winner against @entity214 in october , @entity7 is more focused on his own situation now			2
he managed just five games for @entity1 in a @entity3 shirt before going under the surgeon ’s knife then managed the same again at the end of the season			1
in contrast with others in the squad , then , he feels fresh and ready for tuesday ’s clash with the @entity226 finalists at @entity228 ’s @entity227			0
‘ i ’ve not really got too much fatigue going on the at the minute , so i ’m just happy to be here , but this is certainly a tougher team to get into than when i was involved last time			0
