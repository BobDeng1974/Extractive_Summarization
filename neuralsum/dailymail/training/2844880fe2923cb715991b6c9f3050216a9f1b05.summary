accidents in the hours of darkness on built up roads where there is street lighting have fallen by nearly a fifth lives are being put at risk because motorists are increasingly being ‘ left in the dark ’ by council bosses switching off street lights to save money , a damning report by the @entity6 reveals			1
the rise in unlit roads is posing an increasing danger to motorists , pedestrians and cyclists , it says highlighting how councils are creating early morning ‘ blackouts ’ as an economy measure			0
it said accident rates on blacked - out town and city roads – particularly 40mph zones in bad weather - are getting ‘ much worse ’ and proving to be ‘ a growing menace			2
’ @entity31 is growing so much that the @entity6 predicts a ‘ blackout backlash ’ at the next election as local residents protests against councils of all political hues			0
the @entity6 cited @entity38 figures showing that over the past five years , general improvements in road safety has seen accidents in hours of darkness on built - up roads where there is street lighting fall by nearly a fifth ( 18.6per cent ) overall , and by a quarter ( 24per cent ) in the wet , snow and ice			1
but where street lights were off or not present , the reduction was just 12per cent overall and 16.7per cent in bad weather			1
the @entity6 added that the situation was worse on faster roads			0
since 2008 , night - time accidents on street - lit 40mph sections have dropped 24.1per cent overall and by nearly a third ( 30.4per cent ) in wet , snow or icy conditions			1
but accidents are down only 10.4per cent on both counts where street lights were off or not present			1
the @entity6 highlights that since 2009 there have been six fatalities that coroners have ‘ partly or wholly blamed on the switching off of street lights			2
’ the @entity6 report says : ‘ accident rates on unlit town and city roads continue to get worse			0
this winter , however , discontent with street - light blackouts threatens a backlash in next year ’s elections			1
’ it notes ; ‘ evidence is growing of a potential political backlash – particularly to the north and east of @entity78			0
‘ discontent with the street light switch - off has provided a rallying point for local political opposition , petitions , and e-petitions , such as the government ’ s website and the @entity88 campaign in @entity89			2
’ the @entity6 said the five worst councils for street lighting in this year 's @entity92 and @entity94 public satisfaction survey all operate a street light ‘ blackout ’ during the early hours of the morning			1
@entity97 was bottom of a league of 78 councils with a score of 45.1per cent			2
@entity103 was second with 51.7per cent , followed by @entity104 with 56.5per cent , @entity105 with 58per cent , @entity106 with 58.7per cent , @entity107 ( 58.9 per cent ) , @entity108 ( 59.5 per cent ) , @entity109 ( 60 per cent ) , @entity110 ( 61.8 per cent ) and @entity111 ( 61.9 per cent )			0
by contrast , @entity112 , which has fitted energy - saving led street lights through a @entity114 , topped the street - light satisfaction league with a score of 75.8per cent			1
it is followed by @entity119 ( 73.9 per cent ) , @entity120 ( 73.4 per cent ) , @entity121 ( 73.2 per cent ) , @entity122 ( 73 per cent ) , @entity123 ( 72.7 per cent ) , @entity124 ( 72.1 per cent ) , @entity126 cent ) , @entity127 ( 72.0 per cent ) , and @entity128 ( 71.3 per cent )			0
@entity6 president @entity129 said : ‘ new official road safety statistics show that accident rates on blacked - out town and city roads are not getting better			2
in fact , on 40mph roads , they are getting much worse - particularly in bad weather			2
‘ this is the type of road where most of the fatalities , for which coroners blamed street - light switch - offs as a contributory factor , happened			1
’ mr @entity129 said : ‘ you have to wonder if many councils fully appreciate the difficulties and concern their street light blackouts create for their electorates , particularly those who commute or drive early in the morning			0
the @entity6 report says ‘ accident rates on unlit town and city roads continue to get worse ' ‘ for instance , @entity103 ’s policy review found that the first and last trains of the day required travellers to walk to and from the station in the pitch black			0
little wonder perhaps that counties on the outskirts of the capital , where workers have to get going very early or late to beat the rush , are seeing such a strong backlash			0
’ mr @entity129 added : ‘ we would ask that , as a priority , the lights go back on along 40mph or faster roads in built - up areas			1
‘ crash investigators in inquests have consistently stated that drivers who keep to the speed limit on those roads have little or no chance of missing pedestrians that suddenly appear out of the dark			0
’ ‘ if not , with national and local elections looming , putting cost - savings before road safety hands political opponents a strong populist position to argue on the doorsteps ‘ we will see if @entity187 and the bellwether electorate of @entity189 make @entity97 the ‘ heart of darkness ’ in the electoral battle over councils switching off street lights			1
’ a @entity195 spokesman said : ‘ public safety is our first priority			0
the department provides advice to local authorities on factors they need to consider in managing street lighting , but they are best placed to decide exactly where it is needed			1

accidents have fallen by nearly a fifth on built - up roads with street lighting
where street lights were off or not present the reduction was 12 per cent
@entity97 was the worst local authority for street lighting
@entity112 topped the street - light satisfaction league table
