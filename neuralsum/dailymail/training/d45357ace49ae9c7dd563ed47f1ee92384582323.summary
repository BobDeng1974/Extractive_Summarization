no @entity1 striker had ever taken so long to score his first international goal but @entity3 has finally done it , getting off the mark for his adopted country after 515 minutes in the red shirt			1
in a 4 - 0 win against @entity9 , @entity3 had toiled for 70 frustrating minutes , burying his head in his @entity1 shirt after one horror miss , but failing to bury a single chance			1
it seemed the @entity16 ’s top scorer was going to continue saving all his goals for @entity18 , but the 26 - year - old opened his international account with a scrappy second half goal in the rain at the @entity23			2
@entity3 is surrounded by his @entity1 team - mates after scoring his first international goal on sunday night against @entity9 @entity3 and fellow goalscorer @entity25 celebrate with their @entity1 team - mates as the visitors win 4 - 0 against @entity9 @entity1 's @entity29 scores his third goal in three international games during the @entity33 qualifying match against @entity9 @entity29 ( right ) celebrates his goal after @entity25 ( left ) opened the scoring for @entity1 during the @entity37 qualifier against @entity9 @entity25 celebrates his goal in the 27th minute against @entity9 as @entity1 cruised to the @entity33 qualifying match win on sunday night @entity9 : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 , 60 ) , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 , 75 ) , @entity51 subs : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 bookings : @entity48 , @entity46 goals : none @entity1 : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 , 72 ) , @entity72 , @entity25 ( @entity73 , 71 ) , @entity29 , @entity3 ( @entity74 , 83 ) subs : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 bookings : costa goals : @entity25 ( 27 ) , @entity29 ( 42 ) , @entity3 ( 69 ) , @entity71 ( 88 ) referee : @entity88 ( @entity89 ) it took @entity92 just two minutes to get off the mark for @entity1 , the great @entity90 did it in 47 minutes , former @entity96 striker @entity95 in 77 minutes , @entity1 ’s all - time leading scorer @entity97 in 210 minutes and @entity98 in 220			1
@entity3 was starting to resemble @entity98 in his worst days at @entity18 and he had also drawn blanks in his brief dalliance with the @entity102 national team , failing to score in two friendlies			2
he was mobbed by ecstatic team - mates when he finally broke his duck after @entity65 and @entity106 had seen their shots blocked , before the ball fell to @entity3 inside the six - yard box and he rifled it home			2
for the @entity18 marksman it was more relief than celebration and when he made way for @entity117 striker @entity74 with 10 minutes left , he looked as if a massive weight had been lifted from his shoulders			0
the goal should have come much earlier			0
he nearly scored on 11 minutes when he got his head to a cross from @entity25 but @entity9 goalkeeper @entity39 made the save			1
he then shot from distance but the shot struck a defender and bounced safely into @entity39 ’s hands			0
the @entity18 striker came into the game having had 18 shots without a single goal - in sharp contrast to nine goals from 22 shots for @entity18			0
he was playing without his club team - mate @entity80 , left out of @entity137 ’s team			0
with the provider of so many of his goals on the bench , he tried to turn provider himself for @entity29 but the young @entity117 striker playing alongside him failed to get on the end of @entity3 ’s cross			2
after some intricate play on the edge of the @entity9 area between @entity29 , @entity72 , and @entity70 the ball fell to @entity3 and again he got his shot away well , only for @entity39 to save			1
in @entity80 ’s absence , @entity25 was finding himself in more central areas and he smashed home @entity1 ’s first from the edge of the area			2
the @entity96 man has now scored 22 goals for @entity1 - of non-strikers only @entity156 has scored more in @entity1 ’s history			1
@entity3 turned out to be offside for this chance but the @entity18 striker was unaware as the linesman took his time to raise his flag @entity3 turns away in frustration as he misses a sitter during the @entity1 game but the striker eventually got his name on the score sheet @entity3 hides himself after squandering a great chance to open his goalscoring account for @entity1 against @entity9 on sunday @entity3 was frustrated to not open his @entity1 account in the first half but was able to do so in the second as the visitors ran riot the goal calmed @entity1 ’s nerves but not @entity3 ’s who snatched at his next chance , running on to @entity65 ’s long pass but not making a clean connection with his shot			1
his next miss was worst			0
another long ball out from the back found the forward in a central position inside the area but his attempt to lift it over the goalkeeper and into the far corner ended with his shot going well wide			0
@entity3 buried his head beneath his @entity1 shirt as team - mates on the pitch and on the bench looked on in disbelief			2
@entity64 was in for the dropped @entity76 and he had so little to do he could have taken @entity196 ’s autobiography on to the pitch			0
but he was tested late in the first half , tipping @entity199 ’s cross-shot just over his bar as the home side finally threatened			0
@entity9 are not quite the whipping boys they once were - only two of the last six teams to visit them have come away with a victory , but against a determined @entity1 side coming into the game having lost four of their last six matches , they were two down before half - time			1
and as if to make things even worse for @entity3 , who by now had had seven efforts on goal , it was his strike partner @entity29 who got the second making it three goals in his first three games since his debut			1
in the second period @entity3 added the third before substitute @entity71 got goal number four			1
the @entity224 full - back had managed to find the net on his debut			0
it had taken @entity3 a little longer			0
but the striker @entity1 persuaded to defect from @entity102 , only to see him fail to spark in his home land at the @entity229 , is finally up and running			0
@entity3 falls to ground as the @entity1 striker tries to go around @entity9 goalkeeper @entity39 on sunday night @entity3 nabbed his first goal for @entity1 on sunday night and the @entity18 striker certainly had plenty of chances to do so in the first half			1

@entity96 *midfielder* @entity25 opens scoring against @entity9 on sunday night in @entity33 qualifier
@entity29 , with his third goal in as many games for @entity1 , *doubles* *advantage* *shortly* before half time
@entity3 , having wasted chances in the first half , finally scores his first goal for @entity1 69 minutes in
@entity1 substitute @entity71 makes it 4 - 0 in the 88th minute as the visitors seal the *comfortable* win
@entity3 admits afterwards that not scoring for @entity1 was ' starting to hurt ' and that he was *grateful* to be backed
