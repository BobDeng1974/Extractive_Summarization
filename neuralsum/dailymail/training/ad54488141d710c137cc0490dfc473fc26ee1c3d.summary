when he did , the father - of - five and his business partner @entity13 dedicated two whole years to creating the ultimate @entity15 - 1 car replica			1
@entity6 , 52 , and his business partner @entity13 spent two years converting this rare classic car into a @entity5 replica they covered the car in white emulsion , painted on the famous @entity5 logo and even fitted mock ghost - capturing equipment onto the vehicle			1
