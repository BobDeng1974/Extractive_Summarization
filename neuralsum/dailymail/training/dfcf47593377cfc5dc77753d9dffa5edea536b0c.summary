by @entity0 when @entity1 and @entity2 wanted to show us how ‘ well ’ they were getting on in 2005 , mr @entity1 gave mr @entity2 an ice - cream cone			1
yesterday , in the market square of charming @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity6 bought a slice of @entity12 biscuit cake and broke off a chunk for @entity14			1
‘ go on , @entity14 , you know you want some			2
’ mayor @entity14 : ‘ @entity17 , well , hmmmn			1
’ it looked a bit on the dry side			2
@entity14 inspected it as a small child may examine a broccoli floret which has been placed on his plate with the words ‘ eat your greens ’			2
no way did he want to eat that lump of calories			2
sleek mr @entity6 merrily popped it in his mouth and chewed			1
picture framer @entity63 , 50 , started quizzing him about vat rates			0
mr @entity6 had to answer through a mouthful of crumbs			1
the two @entity69 had descended on unsuspecting @entity8 for little more than ten minutes of frenetic handshaking , leaflet - dispensing , smalltalk and ‘ selfies ’ with voters			1
it being a wednesday morning , most of them were pensioners or parents of toddlers			0
the resignation of @entity8 ’s @entity82 mp @entity81 after a lobbying scandal has caused a by - election on june 5			1
in first - term @entity86 this was a @entity45 seat but the main threat to the @entity69 ’ 16,152 majority now comes from @entity89			2
the purple brigade have chosen for their candidate one @entity91 , a septuagenarian former @entity82 whose views about homosexuality ( he is not a fan ) have caused a minor to - do			1
mr @entity91 was yesterday in a coffee shop on the square			0
mr @entity6 indulged in the political tradition of posing with babies while on the campaign trail securing victory in @entity8 will be key to the @entity82 plan to prove it can see off the threat from @entity89 during a walkabout , mr @entity6 was confronted about government policy on the @entity109 , crime and schools mr @entity6 insisted that the government was putting more money into key public services between @entity14 and @entity115 waddled their party ’s candidate , @entity116 , 32 , a blinky , prosperous - looking fellow who works for @entity121 ’s auction house			1
@entity124 , what are we bid for this rare lot , a sighting of the pm alongside @entity14 , the man who allegedly pants and champs for his job ? they arrived via an alley , @entity14 the shorter and porkier			0
mr @entity6 glistened with health and was wearing a sun tan			1
has he lost weight ? what an essay in oneupmanship he is			0
around voters he becomes incorrigible , all laughter lines and smoky voice saying ‘ well , nice to see you ’ and ‘ what ’s your plan for the day ? ’ , like @entity140			0
’ @entity14 was more staccato , barking ‘ vote on june 5th ’ and ‘ oi - have a leaflet ! ’ voters , confronted by @entity6 , gawp			1
when they see @entity14 they find themselves consumed by merriment			0
yes , his flies were done up			0
occasionally @entity14 strayed from the pm ’s orbit but he took care not to lag too far behind , even when detained by women ( they flutter to him as bluebottles to an old kipper )			0
mr @entity6 and mr @entity14 are expected to be seen together a lot more in the run - up to the 2015 general election the pm has described the @entity53 mayor as one of his ' star players ' who he wants to see on the national pitch one told him huskily , ‘ you ’re the only one who speaks sense ’			1
@entity14 shot her a longing double - take but then raced off to catch up with @entity115 , who was chatting up new mum @entity169 and her baby @entity170 , nine and a half months			2
@entity170 dribbled in a thoughtful sort of way			0
fruits ? @entity89 ’s @entity91 would n’t like that ! melons and cherries			0
mr @entity6 hankered to buy some strawberries but the stallholder was busy and the pm could not wait so his £ 10 note stayed in his hand			1
an old biddy with a shopping trolley appeared			0
‘ good morning ! ’ cried mr @entity6			1
the old girl , like something out of the @entity188 show , did not even raise her head			0
she just ploughed on past , intent on reaching a stall selling pansies			2
a seed stall was advertising hamster food and dog treats			2
would @entity115 buy the faithful @entity14 some large fat balls ( one quid each ) ? no. but he did pat @entity14 ’s hair when a voter remarked on it			0
‘ he ’s had a hair cut and is looking very good , ’ said mr @entity6			1
only when the pm and mayor had vanished did mr @entity91 appear			2
it seemed rather unlike @entity89 to shy away from a confrontation			0
the @entity69 are throwing some effort into @entity8			1
at the railway station i bumped into justice secretary @entity208 and chief whip sir @entity209 , @entity210			0
sir @entity209 was in civvies , including a wonderfully battered gardening hat .			0

@entity81 *persuades* his ' star player ' to join him in campaigning outside @entity53
the @entity82 *duo* were *drumming* up support ahead of the @entity8 by - election
at a bakery stall , @entity6 handed @entity53 mayor a slice of rocky road
pair were confronted in the street about the way the @entity109 is run
