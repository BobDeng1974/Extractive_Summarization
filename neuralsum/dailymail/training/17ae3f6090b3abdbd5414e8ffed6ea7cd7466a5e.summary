by @entity0 published : 13:53 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 03:46 est , 15 march 2013 just hours after cardinal @entity2 was elected the 256th @entity3 , president @entity1 appeared to be gearing up to use @entity5 's powerful new status to @entity5 ’s advantage			1
in a televised address ms @entity1 said she hoped the new @entity3 would ' take a message to the major world powers that they need to participate in dialogue			1
' it is feared that if @entity5 interpret the latest development as an intervention by @entity16 on their side , it could be a catalyst for nationalism			1
@entity1 has already said that she hopes the new @entity3 will take a message to the world 's powers telling them they ca n't ignore the emerging countries the @entity5 pope @entity5 has sparked with @entity1 in the past over gay marriage and implied that women should not hold office tensions between @entity5 and @entity31 governments grew last year as the 30th anniversary of the war for control of the @entity36 islands approached			1
meanwhile military chiefs have drawn up plans for a ' show of force ' to warn off any @entity40 sanctioned - aggression after @entity41 voted to remain under @entity31 sovereignty in a referendum this week			2
@entity1 added that @entity16 and the @entity44 would also wish just causes to sometimes triumph after wishing her compatriot luck , @entity1 said : ' ( we hope ) that ( his mission ) takes the message to the major powers in the world to participate in dialogue ... that the great powers in the world , who have arms and financial power , can be convinced to finally heed the emerging countries and that they commit to a dialogue of civilisations where things are resolved by diplomatic channels rather than by force			1
' she added pointedly : ' we ask @entity16 that he help make it possible that just causes also sometimes triumph in this blessed land we call @entity65 , because i am sure that @entity16 and the @entity44 also wish it so			1
' president @entity1 's relationship with the former archbishop of @entity40 has until now been thorny , the two having engaged in open battle over gay marriage			1
when the conservative cardinal called for @entity74 on her government 's gay marriage proposals , @entity1 accused him of putting forward ideas ' from the @entity79 and the @entity80 '			1
he replied that women were to inept to hold political positions			2
but given her one time enemy ’s new sway , not to mention infallibility , all that seems to be water under the bridge - the @entity5 premier has already cleared her diary to fly to @entity92 for the inaugural mass on tuesday			2
despite their apparent differences , the two share a hostile rhetoric when it comes to the islands			2
as recently as 2010 @entity2 declared : ‘ the @entity41 are ours			2
’ speaking at a @entity100 thursday ceremony a day before the 28th anniversary of the @entity41 in april 2010 , @entity2 had urged the @entity5 people to remember those who had fallen during the war '			0
he said : ‘ we must not forget those whose blood was shed on @entity5 soil			0
’ @entity1 maintains that the @entity41 are @entity5 's land			1
pictured , the @entity107 , @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 during the war @entity5 soldiers , still with their weapons , waiting to be moved from @entity115 airport shortly after the surrender of the @entity41 to the @entity31 force			0
' dialogue is good for everyone , but this dialogue is difficult because it presupposes both sides take small steps			0
he added : ' let 's not forget			1
at meetings like these , reconciliation is the right thing to do , but the @entity41 are ours			0
' and just last year he used a memorial service for the 30th anniversary of the start of the the war to rail at @entity31 who he accused of ‘ usurping ’ the islands			0
during a mass in @entity40 on april 2 he told former conscripts and families of those who died : ' we come to pray for those who have fallen , sons of the homeland who set out to defend his mother , the homeland , to claim the country that is theirs and they were usurped			0
' many young people were there and could not return			0
others returned but none could forget			0
' many scars , many families destroyed by permanent absence or a return cut short			0
the country needs to remember them all			0
