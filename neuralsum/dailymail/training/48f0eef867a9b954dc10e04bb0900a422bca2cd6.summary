by @entity0 last updated at 9:34 pm on 10th february 2012 two @entity2 hotel owners who refused to let a gay couple share a room have been told that the rights of homosexuals come before those of @entity2 in the eyes of the law			1
@entity10 and @entity11 yesterday lost their appeal against an order to pay thousands of pounds in compensation to two gay men who booked an £ 80 - a - night double room at their @entity17			1
the @entity18 told @entity19 and mrs bull that they were entitled to express their beliefs , but not if they were incompatible with the rights of gay people			2
' decent ' : @entity10 and @entity11 from @entity24 , @entity25 , who refused two gay men to stay in the same room of their guest house the landmark ruling by the three @entity31 judges confirmed the supremacy of gay rights over @entity2 belief under the @entity35 brought in by the @entity36			1
mr and mrs bull , 71 and 66 , run @entity38 in @entity24			2
in september 2008 they accepted a booking for an £ 80 - a - night double room from @entity42 , 38 , believing he would be staying with his wife			2
but when mr @entity42 arrived with his 46 - year - old civil partner @entity45 , the men were told that they could have two rooms , but not share one			2
in january last year judge @entity48 ruled at @entity49 that the @entity50 had breached equality legislation and ordered them to pay the couple a total of £ 3,600 damages			1
in their appeal , lawyers for the @entity50 told the appeal court judges that the couple thought any sex outside marriage was a ‘ sin ’			1
they denied that they had discriminated against mr @entity45 and mr @entity42 , from @entity49 , because they had also barred unmarried heterosexual couples from sharing double rooms since they opened for business 25 years ago			0
picturesque : mr and @entity68 's @entity38 hotel in @entity24 , @entity25 but yesterday sir @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , sitting at the @entity18 in @entity74 , unanimously dismissed their plea			0
lady justice @entity73 said : ‘ whilst the appellants ’ beliefs about sexual practice may not find the acceptance that once they did , nevertheless a democratic society must ensure that their espousal and expression remain open to those who hold them			0
‘ however , in a pluralist society it is inevitable that from time to time , as here , views , beliefs and rights of some are not compatible with those of others			0
‘ as i have made plain , i do not consider that the appellants face any difficulty in manifesting their religious beliefs , they are merely prohibited from so doing in the commercial context they have chosen			0
’ victorious : @entity42 , left , and @entity103 outside @entity49 after an earlier hearing			0
they are now due thousands in damages the taxpayer - funded state equality body , the @entity108 , had backed mr @entity42 and mr @entity45 in their action			1
outside court , @entity111 of the @entity108 said : ‘ we believe that this case will help people to better understand the law around freedom of religion			0
‘ when offering a service , people can not use their beliefs , religious or otherwise , to discriminate against others			0
’ but @entity120 , of the @entity121 , which funded @entity19 and mrs @entity68 ’s appeal , said : ‘ something has gone badly wrong with our equality laws when good , decent people like @entity10 and @entity126 are penalised but extremist hate preachers are protected			1
’ neither couple was in court for the hearing .			1

@entity10 and @entity11 lost their appeal against an order to pay thousands in damages to the couple
