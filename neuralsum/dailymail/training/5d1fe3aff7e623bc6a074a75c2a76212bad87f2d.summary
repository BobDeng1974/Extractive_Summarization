he told worshippers in @entity17 to receive their fellow man with open hearts in the @entity2 service			1
pope @entity1 celebrates the @entity21 in @entity14 at the @entity15 while thousands of worshippers watch the televised service holding the crib effigy of the infant @entity25 , @entity1 delivered a service in which he encouraged people to open their hearts to @entity9 and their fellow man thousands gazed at the pontiff 's image on giant screens to watch the @entity33 intoning the @entity34 , a traditional prayer to herald @entity2			1
pope @entity1 delivered a brief and simple homlily , telling worshippers : ' on the part of the people there are times of both light and darkness , fidelity and infidelity , obedience , and rebellion ; times of being a pilgrim people and times of being a people adrift			1
' speaking in @entity51 , he continued : ' in our personal history too , there are both bright and dark moments , lights and shadows			0
' if we love @entity9 and our brothers and sisters , we walk in the light ; but if our heart is closed , if we are dominated by pride , deceit , self - seeking , then darkness falls within us and around us			1
' he then urged crowds not to be afraid to seek the guidance of @entity9			1
' do not be afraid ! our father is patient , he loves us , he gives us @entity25 to guide us on the way which leads to the promised land			0
' @entity25 is the light who brightens the darkness			2
he is our peace , ' he said			0
pope @entity1 lauded @entity25 ' humble beginning as a poor and vulnerable baby , saying : ' you are immense , and you made yourself small ; you are rich , and you made yourself poor ; you are all - powerful and you made yourself vulnerable			1
' he noted that the first to receive news of @entity25 ' birth were shepherds , who in society were considered '' among the last , the outcast			0
" ' the bells of @entity14 rang as @entity1 , who turned 77 a week ago , walked briskly up the main aisle of the basilica for the ceremony , which began two hours before midnight			1
keeping with the theme of humility he has set for his new papacy , @entity1 carried the statue instead of an aide , and kissed a knee of the figure of the newly born @entity25			2
in his first @entity2 service since becoming leader of the @entity4 the @entity1 kisses a statue of the baby jesus pope @entity1 celebrated the service with over 300 cardinals and priests			1
the 77 - year - old urged people not to be afraid to reach out to @entity9 tonight 's service is the only public @entity2 the pope will hold over @entity2			1
he is due to address worshippers on christmas day from the basilica 's central balcony overlooking @entity107 ' the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light ' ( @entity111 ) ' this prophecy of @entity111 never ceases to touch us , especially when we hear it proclaimed in the liturgy of christmas night			1
' this is not simply an emotional or sentimental matter			0
it moves us because it states the deep reality of what we are : a people who walk , and all around us - and within us as well - there is darkness and light			1
' in this night , as the spirit of darkness enfolds the world , there takes place anew the event which always amazes and surprises us : the people who walk see a great light			2
a light which makes us reflect on this mystery : the mystery of walking and seeing			0
this verb makes us reflect on the course of history , that long journey which is the history of salvation , starting with @entity140 , our father in faith , whom the @entity143 called one day to set out , to go forth from his country towards the land which he would show him			0
' from that time on , our identity as believers has been that of a people making its pilgrim way towards the promised land			0
' this history has always been accompanied by the @entity143 ! he is ever faithful to his covenant and to his promises			0
' @entity9 is light , and in him there is no darkness at all ' ( 1 @entity159 )			1
' yet on the part of the people there are times of both light and darkness , fidelity and infidelity , obedience , and rebellion ; times of being a pilgrim people and times of being a people adrift			2
' in our personal history too , there are both bright and dark moments , lights and shadows			0
if we love @entity9 and our brothers and sisters , we walk in the light ; but if our heart is closed , if we are dominated by pride , deceit , self - seeking , then darkness falls within us and around us			1
' whoever hates his brother - writes the @entity188 - is in the darkness ; he walks in the darkness , and does not know the way to go , because the darkness has blinded his eyes ' ( 1 @entity188 2:11 )			2
' on this night , like a burst of brilliant light , there rings out the proclamation of the @entity198 : ' @entity9 's grace has been revealed , and it has made salvation possible for the whole human race ' ( @entity202 2:11 )			1
' the grace which was revealed in our world is @entity25 , born of the @entity205 , true man and true @entity9			2
he has entered our history ; he has shared our journey			0
he came to free us from darkness and to grant us light			2
' in him was revealed the grace , the mercy , and the tender love of the father : @entity25 is @entity216 incarnate			0
he is not simply a teacher of wisdom , he is not an ideal for which we strive while knowing that we are hopelessly distant from it			0
' he is the meaning of life and history , who has pitched his tent in our midst			0
the shepherds were the first to see this ' tent ' , to receive the news of @entity25 ' birth			0
they were the first because they were among the last , the outcast			0
' and they were the first because they were awake , keeping watch in the night , guarding their flocks			0
together with them , let us pause before the child , let us pause in silence			0
' together with them , let us thank the lord for having given @entity25 to us , and with them let us raise from the depths of our hearts the praises of his fidelity : we bless you , lord @entity9 most high , who lowered yourself for our sake			2
' you are immense , and you made yourself small ; you are rich and you made yourself poor ; you are all - powerful and you made yourself vulnerable			0
' on this night let us share the joy of the gospel : @entity9 loves us , he so loves us that he gave us his son to be our brother , to be light in our darkness			1
' to us the @entity143 repeats : ' do not be afraid ! ' ( @entity260 2:10 )			0
and i too repeat : do not be afraid ! our father is patient , he loves us , he gives us @entity25 to guide us on the way which leads to the promised land			0
@entity25 is the light who brightens the darkness			2
' some who had travelled thousands of miles to attend the service felt compelled to make the journey as they felt the new leader had breathed fresh life into the @entity4			1
' ( @entity276 ) is bringing a new era into the @entity4 , a church that is focusing much more on the poor and that is more austere , more lively , a church that cares about everyone in the world , ' said @entity283 , from the pope 's native @entity284			1
@entity286 said he had not been to @entity287 in @entity14 but now wanted to get a first - hand look at the new pope			2
