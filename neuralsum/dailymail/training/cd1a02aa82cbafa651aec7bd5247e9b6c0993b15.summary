it is more than five months since @entity1 left @entity2 having been knocked out by @entity3			1
the @entity4 had been felled by his bitter rival , who landed a huge punch to fell @entity1 , and left the ring that night devastated having lost to @entity3 for the second time			1
many wrote the 26 - year - old 's career off there and then - but much has happened in those intervening months to revitalise the @entity14 's career , including an extremely impressive victory over @entity16			0
and that prize , a reinvigorated @entity1 insists , will soon be around his waist			1
' it 's an inevitability that i will be world champion - it will happen , ' he told @entity40 while promoting the launch of the new far cry 4 game , due to be released on november 18			1
' i want to achieve the dream i have held since i was a child and i will , no doubt about it at all			0
' we 'll plough on through this next fight and then the dream could become a reality sooner than many ever thought it might			2
' and that next bout is only a week away , with @entity51 @entity17 facing @entity1 at @entity53 's @entity52 on november 22			1
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity3 face up to each other following their rematch back in may @entity1 , pictured after his win over @entity16 , believes it is only a matter of time before he is world champion @entity1 is extremely confident for the fight , though not complacent , and is adamant he will get the second rematch with @entity3 he so craves if - or more important in his words ' when ' - he keeps on winning			1
' i 'm in great shape and i just ca n't wait to get out there so we can strut our stuff , ' he added			0
' @entity17 's a southpaw and i have never been defeated by a southpaw so the confidence is flowing			2
' after the loss to @entity3 last time it felt like life or death - as boxing does at times - but i 've come back well and he is back on my radar			2
' i would love a @entity76 to happen and i think i would beat him			0
' he is being indecisive about the whole thing , delaying who he will fight next , and we all know he does n't like me			0
' if i win a world title fight , which i know is going to happen , then i am almost certain , almost certain , that a third bout will happen			2
' @entity3 ( right ) knocked @entity1 out at @entity2 in may but a third fight could happen in the future @entity1 is the mandatory challengers for @entity51 @entity18 's world title and believe he will win it but @entity3 is not the only potential future @entity88 opponent being touted for @entity1 , with @entity19 smarting for a chance to avenge his solitary defeat back in may 2011			1
@entity1 is coy about the possibility of an alternative @entity88 superfight but admits it is not totally outside the realms of possibility			0
he continued : ' if we both keep winning then our paths will cross again , that much is clear			0
i 'm not thinking about him right now but he may come around again as a potential opponent in the future			0
' if he wins a world title , and when i win my world title , then a huge unification fight could happen			1
@entity1 ( right ) , pictured beating @entity19 back in 2011 , thinks they could face each other again front cover of @entity27 4 , released on november 18 ' we both have big personalities and there is an atmosphere between us as everyone know , so there would be nothing bigger than if we had a unification fight in the future			1
' talk of @entity88 superfights are for the future , however , and @entity1 is concentrating on the present			2
@entity17 is up next , with @entity18 to follow , and @entity1 is adamant he will improve on his current record of : 22 fights , 20 wins , two losses ( both to @entity3 )			1
' i 'm ready for the fight , and to be honest ready for the next one , but i will concentrate on winning in @entity53 first			2
' the hard work is already banked so the next couple of weeks are slightly frustrating as it is all about having time to chill and having more time to myself			0
' we always mean business and that means i intend for there to be a stoppage against @entity17			0
i wo n't go gung ho , it will be controlled , but i intend to knock him out			0
' and , if he does , @entity1 will be well along the road to finally achieving his dream			0
