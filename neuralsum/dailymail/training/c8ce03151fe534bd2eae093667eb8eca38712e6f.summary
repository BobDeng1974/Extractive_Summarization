the damaged hard drive containing @entity4 official @entity3 's missing emails was disposed of more than two years ago , the agency confessed on wednesday			1
republicans had hoped to retrieve the broken hard drive and have it fixed so they could review @entity3 's emails and determine whether her department acted alone in targeting conservative organizations or it received a mandate from the @entity13 administration			1
that wo n't be possible because it recycled in 2011 , the agency told @entity16 yesterday			1
' we believe the standard @entity18 protocol was followed in 2011 for disposing of the broken hard drive , ' an @entity18 spokesman told the news organization			2
' a bad hard drive , like other broken @entity24 equipment , is sent to a recycler as part of our regular process			0
' long gone : @entity3 's damaged hard drive was recycled years ago , the @entity18 said on wednesday , blowing a hole in @entity5 ' latest attempts to recover @entity3 's missing emails @entity33 chairman @entity32 and @entity33 oversight subcommittee chairman @entity34 had already discovered that the @entity18 has known as far back as february that it no longer had email correspondence for @entity3 and other key players implicated in the tea party targeting scandal and failed to share that information with @entity40			1
the @entity18 also ' lost ' the emails of six other agency officials associated with the scheme – in addition to those of @entity3 – and kept it a secret for months , the @entity41 said on tuesday			1
' it looks like the @entity52 people were lied to and the @entity18 tried to cover - up the fact it conveniently lost key documents in this investigation , ' the duo said in a press release on tuesday			2
' plot lines in @entity58 are more believable than what we are getting from this @entity61 and the @entity18			2
' the news prompted the @entity63 to issue broad subpoenas on tuesday afternoon for hard drives , thumb drives and other backups that @entity3 and the tax authorities may have used to archive her messages			1
' it is a little too convenient that right in middle of @entity3 orchestrating the targeting of conservative groups , poof , her emails disappear , ' @entity32 and @entity34 said in a statement on wednesday			2
' it is even harder to believe that six other @entity18 employees , including @entity79 , also had their systems go down and supposedly permanently deleted critical details that could help us prove what was really happening at the @entity18 , ' they continued			0
' we need to know where these computers are , who looked at them and when			0
' @entity79 served as chief of staff to @entity90 , who was the deputy commissioner of the @entity18 during the targeting scandal			1
she visited the @entity61 more than a dozen times between july 2010 and april 2013 , according to a @entity16 , raising suspicion among the @entity33 leaders			1
' who was she visiting at the @entity61 and what were they talking about ? was she updating the @entity61 on the targeting or was she getting orders ? these are answers we do n’t yet have , because – surprise , surprise – a few computers crashed , ' they said in a statement on tuesday			2
@entity34 told @entity16 on wednesday that ' it experts have weighed in and said yes — we can get those ' emails off the broken hard drives			1
but later in the day @entity109 sen. @entity108 confirmed the @entity18 ' statement that the hard drives were long gone , telling @entity16 , ' we ’ve been informed that the hard drive has been thrown away			1
hundreds of them saw their applications delayed or denied while politically liberal organizations skated by and quickly received approval			0
the @entity18 informed the committee on friday that 28 months of emails of the former head of the tax - exempt division , @entity3 , had been lost in a computer crash and could not be recovered because many records were not backed up on servers , tapes or external drives			1
its own guidelines require that ' @entity18 offices will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail messages that are federal records only on the electronic mail system			2
' it also requires its offices to back up email messages to ' a separate electronic recordkeeping system			0
' the @entity150 reported on tuesday that @entity18 regulations require employees to print out copies of all communications that are subject to federal recordkeeping laws			2
' the @entity157 ’s current email policy requires emails and attachments that meet the definition of a federal record be added to the organization ’s files , ' the agency 's employee guidance reads , ' by printing them ( including the essential transmission data ) and filing them with related paper records			2
' according to @entity16 , before may 2013 , when the targeting scheme came to light , the @entity18 only kept copies of data going back six months , so copies of @entity3 's emails from january 2009 to april 2010 are missing , as well as other @entity18 officials			1
@entity18 commissioner @entity177 will be hauled before two @entity61 committee hearings next week to explain how @entity3 's emails could have been lost despite robust data - retention standards in the @entity52 government @entity32 and @entity34 said on monday that ' we are simply not going to accept the @entity18 claim that these documents are not recoverable			1
we will demand the president live up to his promise to work " hand in hand " with @entity40 to get the facts			0
' the two lawmakers wrote to president @entity13 this week asking the @entity61 for records of emails between @entity3 and employees the @entity61 , the @entity157 , the @entity192 , the @entity193 , the @entity194 and the @entity195			1
that move came hours after @entity33 staff interviewed government employees charged with running the @entity18 's internal computer networks			1
a committee aide told @entity201 that those @entity18 workers confirmed that budget and space limitations forced the agency to limit officials ' access to networks that would ordinarily store email archives			1
they also said , according to the aide , that other executive branch agencies have their own independent archives of the records now lost at the @entity18			0
@entity32 and @entity34 asked @entity13 to order ' an exhaustive search for all @entity3 emails ' throughout the executive branch			0
but the @entity61 is likely under no obligation to cooperate			0
president @entity13 has already referred to the @entity18 matter as one of several ' phony scandals ' that he believes are politically motivated			0
yet in may 2013 when the scandal first erupted , @entity13 pledged that his administration would ' make sure that we are working hand in hand with @entity40 to get this thing fixed			0
' subpoena : rep. @entity227 is demanding @entity177 show up for an evening interrogation on june 23 the @entity229 threw that phrase back in the president 's face on monday			0
' in order to ensure accountability and “ get this thing fixed , ” please provide ... all communications between @entity3 and any persons within the @entity236 ( @entity236 ) for the period between january 1 , 2009 and may 1 , 2011 , ' they wrote			0
' also , please indicate in writing when the @entity236 [ executive office of the president ] was informed , and by whom , that the @entity18 had lost critical @entity3 documents			2
' on tuesday , @entity244 rep. @entity227 , who chairs the @entity63 , demanded that @entity18 commissioner @entity177 explain – in person – how 28 months of emails to and from @entity3 were ' lost ' to a computer crash			1
@entity227 wrote to @entity177 in reaction to his agency 's claim friday that the @entity18 no longer has copies of emails between @entity3 and anyone outside the @entity18 from january 2009 through april 2011			1
@entity227 demanded in his letter that @entity177 appear in a rare evening hearing on june 23 , a half - day before he 's scheduled to testify before the @entity33			2
' i will not tolerate your continued obstruction and game - playing in response to the @entity63 ’s investigation of the @entity18 targeting , ' he wrote			0
' for too long , the @entity18 has promised to produce requested – and , later , subpoenaed – documents , only to respond later with excuses and inaction			0
' in the @entity63 , @entity227 hammered @entity177 for promising in a march 26 hearing that he would deliver every email @entity40 sought			0
at the time , however , he insisted that it would take ' years ' for lawyers to sift through them all and excise private taxpayer information that the @entity18 is n't permitted to share – not even with other arms of government			0
and simply searching through @entity3 's individual email storage , @entity177 said then , would n't produce an exhaustive record			1
' they ’re stored somewhere , ' he explained to @entity109 rep. @entity276 during the hearing			0
' they get taken off and stored in servers and you ’ve got 90 - thousand employees , ' he insisted , but ' we can find , and we are in fact searching – we can find @entity3 ’s emails			1
' at the time , he did n't mention the computer crash which became an overnight butt of jokes among conservatives			0
the @entity292 has the original files , ' @entity291 speechwriter @entity290 tweeted			0
' wonder what the # @entity18 would say if we told them we could n’t submit tax documents because of a computer crash ? ' replied her boss , @entity299 @entity5 sen. @entity5			1
' @entity301 ' game show host @entity302 , who has begun wearing his conservatism on his sleeve in recent years , tweeted : ' weird			0
hundreds of emails to & from someone named @entity3 just showed up in my spam			0

@entity18 commissioner @entity177 testified in march that @entity3 's emails were accessible but would take ' years ' in some cases to gather
@entity177 said messages are stored ' on a server ' and not on individual employees ' *pcs*
yet , the @entity18 told the @entity33 last week that more than two years ' worth of @entity3 's emails to and from people outside the @entity18 were lost in a computer crash
the agency also says it does not have emails for six other officials involved in the tea party targeting scandal
a *congressional* committee issued subpoenas on tuesday for all the hard drives the @entity18 and former official @entity3 used to back up her emails
but on wednesday the @entity18 told @entity16 that @entity3 's drive was recycled years ago
@entity5 hope to find out if @entity18 officials *colluded* with the @entity61 , the @entity192 , the @entity157 or other agencies to play political *favorites* with the tax code
