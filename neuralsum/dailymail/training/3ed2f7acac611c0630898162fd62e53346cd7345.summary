a brown snake gave swimmers and sunbathers on a @entity4 north coast beach a bit of scare when it came slithering out of the surf between the red and yellow flags			1
when lifeguards started blowing on their whistles to evacuate people out of the water at @entity15 , beach goers initially thought the snake was a shark			1
but as it swam closer to the shore it soon became clear it was a 1.5 - metre brown snake , the @entity18 reported			1
' the snake travelled out of the water and remained on the shore for a while until waves washed up against it , ' she said			2
' raising its head , it headed for shade towards the lifeguard trailer and happily sat there until again moving up along the beach to the bush			2
' on the way , as we were leaving , the snake began heading back down towards the sea at a quicker pace , but was not in the ocean as we left			2
' the incident happened on tuesday and swimmers had to be evacuated from the water as lifeguards dealt with it @entity56 supervisor for lifeguards @entity54 told @entity57 in the 20 years he had been with the @entity59 organisation he had not seen anything like this before			1
he has been a lifeguard for the last six years			0
mr @entity54 said the snake was just metres from the shore , which was ' very unusual for the snake '			1
' i 've never seen a snake rock up like that , ' he said			0
' i 've seen penguins , lots of dolphins , turtles and seals , but never a snake before			0
' it was a bit of shock ... we did n't want to get in its way			0
' [ i heard ] some people say they did n't know if it was better or worse that it was a snake instead of a shark			2
' swimmers were evacuated out of the water until the snake was off the beach mr @entity86 said it was unusual for snakes to be in the water and he had only ever caught three on a beach in his 15 years living in the area mr @entity54 said the snake , with the assistance of local snake catcher @entity86 , eventually retreated to the south of the beach into the bush area			1
mr @entity86 had to instruct lifeguards over the phone because he did not have a vehicle to get out to the beach			2
' i told him [ the lifesaver ] to walk behind it and keep walking , do n't panic him ... he 'll eventually go away , ' he told @entity57			0
' if it has an escape route , it will sense you behind it and it will just keep going			0
' they are more scared of you , if you start harassing a brown snake it will defend itself			1
' mr @entity86 said it was unusual for snakes to be in the water and he had only ever caught a few on a beach in his 15 years living in the area			1
' they 're not a lover of water , so they do n't normally go into water unless they have to , ' he said			0
' he was probably trying to get away from something â€¦ because the lifesaver said he came out of the surf			0
' a photo of the snake was posted on the @entity132 newspaper 's @entity130 page and it sparked an outpouring of stories from its readers about their own experiences with snakes			0
one joker made a tongue - in - cheek post with a photo of @entity142 in his infamous ' budgie smugglers ' and the words : ' here 's another snake at the beach			1
' according to local resident june @entity148 , tuesday 's incident follows another ' a few weeks ago ' where a brown snake was spotted just outside one mile @entity151			1
ms @entity148 posted on social media saying : ' the very brave surf livesaver gave it a squirt from the hose and it slithered back to the dune			0
