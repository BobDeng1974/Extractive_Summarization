by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:14 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 5 december 2012 the first dinosaur to have walked on @entity3 may have been found by scientists			2
@entity5 would have been alive 10 to 15 million years before any previously known dinosaurs - and more than 150million years before the mighty @entity7			1
the size of a @entity9 and slight of build , @entity5 had a five foot - long tail and likely walked upright on two legs			1
@entity5 , either the earliest dinosaur or the closest dinosaur relative yet discovered			1
it was up to three metres long , and similar in size to a golden retriever the fossilized upper arm and six vertebrae date from just a few million years after the ' @entity20 ' , the greatest of all time , and provide important insight into the origin and early evolution of dinosaurs			1
all life on @entity3 today is descended from the four per cent of species that survived the mysterious event 250 million years ago that may have been caused by an asteroid impact or volcanic eruptions			1
the researchers said : ' we can say , with confidence , the lineage leading to dinosaurs evolved by the @entity36 , the early part of the @entity39 epoch , approximately 243 million years ago			1
' with only a few ribs and arm bones to go on , the scientists ca n't be sure what the world 's oldest dinosaur ate			0
however , it is likely it had a similar diet to other early dinosaurs of small prey , insects and plants			1
the fossilised bones were collected during a @entity55 expedition to @entity56 in the 1930s and gradually examined over the decades by @entity59 palaeontologist @entity58			0
he requested that the work be continued on his death and the full details have now been published			0
dr @entity63 , a @entity59 dinosaur expert who took part in the study , said : ' we do n't know if it walked on two legs or four legs but our prediction is that it 's two legs and the reason is that the majority of early dinosaurs are two - legged animals			1
' we do n't know what it ate because we do n't have any of the teeth of skull			0
' but other early dinosaurs had a mixed diet			2
' the remains do , however , allow for its size to be estimated			0
@entity5 is believed to have been 6.5 to 10ft from nose to tail , with its tail accounting for half of that			1
its slight build means it would have lived ' in the shadow ' of other much larger reptiles alive at the time			0
the humerus , or upper arm bone , of @entity5 next to a cross section of the bone			1
the many colors indicate that the bone fibers are disorganized , much like those of early dinosaurs			2
@entity105 researcher dr @entity104 said : ' if the newly named @entity5 is not the earliest dinosaur , then it is the closest relative found so far			1
' @entity5 establishes that dinosaurs likely evolved earlier than previously expected and refutes the idea that dinosaur diversity burst onto the scene in the @entity112 , a burst of diversification unseen in any other groups at that time			1
' it may not be correct to say dinosaurs originated in @entity56 because when @entity5 lived the world ’s continents were joined in the landmass called @entity120			1
@entity56 would have been part of @entity120 that included @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
dr @entity63 , of the @entity59 in @entity126 , said : ' the new findings place the early evolution of dinosaurs and dinosaur like reptiles firmly in the southern continents			0
the specimen , which is detailed in the @entity134 , is stored in @entity126 at the @entity59			0
remains of a second of the creatures are kept in @entity138			0
@entity5 is named after the @entity140 lake @entity141 ( also known as @entity141 ) and @entity142 , the @entity55 palaeontologist who collected the specimen in the 1930s			2
bones of @entity5 were collected in southwest @entity56 in the 1930s from the @entity147 , which preserves fossils of many animals from the @entity150 of @entity3 's history			2
@entity63 of @entity126 's @entity59 , part of the team who made the new discovery , excavates a skeleton of a prosauropod dinosaur near @entity158 , @entity122 the bones of the new animal reveal a number of characteristics common to early dinosaurs and their close relatives			0
for example , the bone tissues in the upper arm bone appear as if they are woven haphazardly and not laid down in an organised way indicating rapid growth , a common feature of dinosaurs			0
biologist @entity172 , of the @entity173 , who did the bone analysis , said : ' we can tell from the bone tissues @entity5 had a lot of bone cells and blood vessels			2
' in living animals , we only see this many bone cells and blood vessels in animals that grow quickly , like some mammals or birds			0
' the bone tissue of @entity5 is exactly what we would expect for an animal at this position on the dinosaur family tree			2
' it is a very good example of a transitional fossil ; the bone tissue shows @entity5 grew about as fast as other primitive dinosaurs , but not as fast as later ones			1
' another example is the upper arm bone ’s distinctively enlarged crest , needed to anchor the upper arm muscles			0
the feature , known as an elongated deltopectoral crest , is also common to all early dinosaurs .			0

@entity5 is more than 10 million years older than previously discovered dinosaurs
believed to have walked upright on two legs , and feed on small insects and plants
