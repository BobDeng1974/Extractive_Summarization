it will be a new - look @entity1 that returns to the @entity2 to great anticipation this week but such is the reputation of @entity5 on @entity7 nights , the class of 2014 know expectations will be sky - high among their supporters			1
@entity10 , one of the club ’s new generation with the difficult task of following @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 into @entity7 folklore , can feel the tingle of excitement ahead of tuesday night ’s game with @entity24 side @entity22 , with glamour ties against @entity26 and @entity27 to come			1
but he warns it is also the job of @entity31 ’ squad to let the fans soak up the emotion , while they deal with the reality of playing in @entity37 ’s premier competition after a five - year absence			2
@entity10 is relishing playing in the @entity2 for @entity1 at @entity5 ‘ i ’ve heard all about the experience of playing at @entity5 in the @entity2 – i can ’ t wait for it to happen , ’ he says			1
‘ when we come out with the floodlights turned on , it will be more like appearing at a show or a concert than a football match			0
the atmosphere at our stadium was fantastic last year when the fans would gather to wait for our team bus to arrive , and this will be different , and maybe even better			2
‘ i know about @entity1 ’s tradition in the competition , so hopes will be high			1
but considering @entity1 as one of the favourites for the @entity2 before we kick a ball is something for the fans , not for the team			1
‘ i believe that we have a strong squad , new players have been brought in and we are in a good position to perform well in the @entity2 , but without calling ourselves favourites or anything like that			2
’ @entity31 has been preparing his @entity1 squad for their @entity2 return the likes of @entity71 ( centre ) and @entity73 ( right ) , among others , were brought in to add depth @entity10 is right to be cautious in his optimism			1
only four survivors – @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 - are left at @entity5 from their last @entity2 campaign in 2009/10 when they were knocked out of the group stage after defeats against @entity86 ’s @entity85 , and @entity87 who had @entity89 in goal			1
of the quartet , only @entity78 is likely to start this week , and he added to the anticipation by attending last week ’s premier of a new film “ @entity99 in @entity98 ” about the club ’s legendary fifth @entity2 triumph against @entity97 in @entity98 in 2005			2
the number of @entity2 debutants in @entity31 ’ likely line - up leaves @entity10 , at the age of 22 , as one of @entity1 ’s more experienced @entity7 players			1
he was just 18 when he played in the @entity2 for then - holders @entity106 , including the two matches against @entity109 that made @entity110 famous			2
@entity78 celebrates a famous goal against @entity112 at @entity5 in 2004 his hero growing up in @entity114 , @entity115 , won the trophy with @entity117 and he remembers feeling sorry at the time for @entity118 when his @entity97 team were defeated by @entity1 in @entity98 in the 2005 final			1
‘ we are confident we can go through to the next round but we know it ’ll be difficult			0
not just against @entity26 , but the other two teams as well			0
‘ it ’s @entity2 so of course it is going to be tough			2
but we are looking forward to getting off to a good start with the fans behind us			0
then we will look at it game by game and see if we can get through to the next round			0
‘ of course , i ’m well aware @entity1 have won the trophy a number of times			1
the players are very motivated and excited to be in the @entity2			2
it ’s not only important for the fans to be back in the @entity2 , but also important for the players			1
‘ we want to get off to a good start next week and have other good matches along the way			0
‘ the @entity2 has become a famous tournament in @entity114 , people are watching it as much as @entity146 football			1
for me , it is certainly an inspiration			0
’ @entity10 and new @entity1 signing @entity73 crossed paths for a couple of weeks at the @entity152 , @entity10 arriving from @entity114 just as the striker was getting ready to leave for @entity154			1
but the midfielder , recently drafted into the @entity114 squad after being left out of the @entity157 by @entity158 , names another team - mate he thinks will take @entity37 by storm			0
@entity1 supporters at the @entity164 end come alive on a big @entity7 night at @entity5 @entity1 parade the 2005 @entity2 outside @entity5 that they won in dramatic fashion in @entity98 ‘ it is likely @entity173 will be one of our stars , ’ he says without hesitation about the new golden boy of @entity171 football			1
‘ he is having a very good time and is in very good shape			0
i believe he will do quite well in the @entity2 , he ’s very fast – i know i do n’t have the speed to catch him ! ‘ i ’ve not been surprised at all by his performances this season , including for @entity171			2
we train together every day so i know his potential			0
i ’m confident this will be a good season for him			0
’ @entity1 ’s surprise title challenge last season was mounted without the distraction of midweek @entity7 football			1
@entity31 has signed eight players in the summer to try and cope with the dual demands and @entity10 does n’t think it will harm the club ’s results			0
‘ i think the more big matches we have , the more motivated we will feel , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t feel it will be a problem to play in both competitions at the same time			0
’ @entity10 ’s quick feet and match intelligence have already made him a natural fit for @entity1 ’s famed pass - and - move style			1
the last two @entity171 clubs to have won the @entity2 , @entity206 and @entity207 , both had a @entity146 member of their victorious squad ; @entity211 and @entity212			0
@entity31 and @entity164 will hope good things come in threes .			0
