by @entity0 created 4:53 pm on 10th november 2011 hero : lost @entity3 sergeant @entity2 was among eight wartime servicemen whose remains laid unidentified until a historian solved the mystery the remains of a ' lost ' @entity10 airman who saved a pilot from a burning plane a week before he was killed in @entity13 have finally been found 68 years on			1
sergeant @entity2 and seven other @entity16 servicemen perished when their @entity18 bomber was shot down over @entity19 in 1943			1
a week before his death , sgt @entity2 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , rescued a @entity24 pilot whose aircraft crashed and burst into flames at @entity27 , @entity28			1
he rushed into the burning wreckage and dragged the badly - wounded pilot to safety , an act for which he was posthumously awarded the @entity34			2
for nearly seven decades , @entity35 and his seven comrades have lain in unmarked graves in a @entity19 cemetery as none of them were identifiable due to the impact of the crash			1
now dedicated @entity19 historian @entity43 has solved the mystery and identified all eight airmen , bringing great comfort and relief to their families			1
they will travel to @entity50 , @entity19 , for a ceremony to dedicate the new marked @entity53 headstones with the correct names on			1
retired schoolteacher mr @entity43 discovered the truth after unearthing old photos of the aircraft wreckage and a @entity59 report describing the plane involved			2
remarkably , he also traced eye - witnesses to the crash after nearly seven decades by placing an appeal for help in a local newspaper			0
the new information helped him whittle the potential aircraft down to @entity18 bomber @entity68			0
perished : novice serviceman @entity69 ( left ) was on his maiden flight to gain more experience when the plane , piloted by @entity73 , was shot down one of the reasons why it has taken so long to learn the truth is because there are seven graves for the eight men that were on board			1
the @entity59 who buried their remains assumed there were seven of them because that was the usual number of a bomber crew			0
but the aircraft in question was carrying novice pilot @entity69 on his maiden flight so he could gain operational experience			2
also , the @entity89 wrongly informed the families the plane had crashed at sea after an unidentified airman was washed ashore at @entity94			2
mr @entity69 's younger brother @entity95 , 80 , from @entity96 , @entity97 , today said it is a wonderful but emotional time for his family			0
names to remains : sgt @entity101 was navigating on the doomed flight , while sgt @entity103 was the aircraft engineer			0
they have finally been recognised bomb aimer pilot officer @entity105 he said : ' our only regret is that our mother , father and elder brother did n't get to find out what happened to @entity69			2
' he was reported as missing believed killed in action and then it was thought the plane had crashed in the sea			2
' my mother held out hope that @entity69 had been taken prisoner and after the war she believed he was suffering from amnesia in a corner of @entity124 somewhere			0
' so to hear this news after 68 years and the prospect of being able to pay hommage and say goodbye to him is staggeringly wonderful			1
' mr @entity69 's nephew , @entity129 , 49 , added : ' the gratitude my father , uncles and auntie feel towards @entity43 is enormous			0
' at last the story has come to an end and they can honour their brother properly and say a proper goodbye			0
' @entity139 , 86 , from @entity140 , @entity141 , is the younger sister of pilot sergeant @entity73			0
she said : ' i am very pleased and relieved to hear this news after so long			2
' mr @entity43 , 67 , said he felt compelled to identify the unmarked graves at the @entity146 cemetery out of gratitude to the war dead			1
he said : ' this is my way of showing my respect and gratitude to those who fought and died for our freedom			0
' at that time , in the middle of the war , the @entity154 were our friends and because of them we ended up a free nation			0
' tragedy : the wreckage of the men 's @entity18 bomber shot down over @entity19 during @entity13			1
remarkably , historian @entity163 even tracked down eyewitnesses to the crash as he sought to find their identities the crew of @entity68 were pilot sgt @entity73 , navigator sgt @entity101 , bomb aimer pilot officer @entity105 , wireless operator @entity169 , flight engineer sgt @entity103 , mid upper gunner @entity171 , rear gunner @entity172 and second pilot @entity174			1
on the night of april 20 , 1943 , @entity175 of @entity176 , @entity28 , was part of a formation of 339 bombers on a raid on @entity59 munitions factories in @entity182			0
while over the @entity19 coast the aircraft was struck by @entity59 flak			1
realising they were going down , the crew dumped the 1,000lbs bomb in a field before crashing at @entity189			0
the impact caused the remaining incendiary bombs and fuel to blow the @entity18 apart			0
anonymous : the cemetery in @entity146 , @entity19 , where the eight men were buried in unmarked graves finally honoured : the @entity197 ceremony is officially opened			1
the families of the men will now travel there to dedicate the new marked @entity53 headstones mr @entity43 said : ' in local archives i found some photos of the plane wreckage and was able to identify a @entity207 engine which @entity18 bombers had			1
' another photo showed a feature of the undercarriage which proved it was definitely a @entity18			0
' i then placed an article in a local newspaper and to my surprise several eye - witnesses who are still alive today came forward			0
' they stated the bomber came in over @entity19 with the main force when it was shot at and crashed at @entity189			1
' i also found @entity59 reports with a list of 30 aircraft that were shot down in this operation - 19 of them were shot down on @entity19 territory			1
' the man to thank : determined historian @entity43 has closed a chapter in history that was shrouded in mystery mr @entity43 then contacted @entity230 at the @entity231			0
he confirmed eight @entity18 bombers crashed over @entity19 and seven of them are accounted for			2
after checking the names on the @entity235 in @entity236 for lost airmen , mr @entity230 was able to confirm the names of the crew through a process of elimination			0
with the ' jigsaw ' of evidence pieced together , mr @entity43 presented it to the @entity53 which agreed it had been proved beyond doubt			0
@entity245 , of the @entity231 , said : ' when @entity43 approached us for help we were able to prove the graves must belong to the crew of @entity68 because we traced all of the other @entity252 bombers that crashed that night and every other aircraft we were able to pin to a different geographical location			2
' the crew has lain in anonymous graves for the last 68 years			1
' now we have traced all of the families and most of them are planning a trip to @entity19 to visit their loved one 's graves next spring for a ceremony			1

eight servicemen died after plane shot down over @entity19 in 1943
one had saved a pilot from burning aircraft a week before he was killed
@entity273 had lain in unmarked graves for nearly seven decades
identities finally solved after @entity19 historian unearthed new evidence
families will now *attend* ceremony to dedicate new graves
relative : ' to hear this news after 68 years is staggeringly wonderful '
