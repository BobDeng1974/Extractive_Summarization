by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 27 november 2012 @entity2 : 13:02 est , 27 november 2012 governor @entity3 is coming under fire after saying that @entity5 was ' more impactful ' than @entity6 , even though the 2005 storm still caused significantly more deaths			1
the @entity10 governor ignored the staggering different death tolls - @entity6 caused 1,833 deaths while @entity5 is attributed in 121 deaths - but went on to say that last month 's hurricane ' affected many , many more people and places than @entity6 '			1
he broached the controversial topic during a press conference on monday while explaining his rationale in asking for nearly $ 42billion in federal aid for the reconstruction process			0
@entity3 said @entity5 was worse than @entity6 in some respects @entity32 : superstorm @entity5 just before it slammed into @entity35 's @entity34			1
the damage clean - up is still ongoing @entity39 's demands raise the total estimates for the storm 's damage , as all of the affected @entity34 states combined now require at least $ 71,3billion			2
the total , which is substantially larger than previous estimates of $ 50billion and could still grow , came as @entity3 laid out his state 's needs			1
he said that their total of $ 41.9billion is made up of including $ 32.8billion to repair and restore damaged housing , parks and infrastructure and to cover lost revenue and other expenses , as well as $ 9.1billion to mitigate potential damage from future severe weather events			2
as many are still grappling with the devastation from @entity5 , the governor 's words appeared callous to some @entity63 users			1
' human life trumps property			0
how did you miss that ? ' wrote @entity68			0
another man , identified only as @entity70 , said that it was just an example of @entity3 being a politician : ' of course @entity5 was worse than @entity6 for @entity3 , because it was his state that got hit this time			1
' @entity73 , an economic reporter at @entity74 , wrote ' slow your roll , gov ' when he retweeted the news on his personal @entity63 account while his co-worker @entity80 wrote ' seems like this is n't wise '			0
hellish : @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity10			2
the fire ripped through ore than 100 houses in the flooded neighborhood destroyed : @entity89 collapsed house in @entity30			2
@entity10 officials have outlined measures costing $ 9.1billion to help protect against further storms while @entity5 may have damaged more homes and businesses , @entity6 took a far greater toll on human lives , killing more than 1,800 people directly or indirectly			1
@entity5 , by comparison , is believed to have killed at least 121 people			2
' @entity6 got a lot of notoriety for the way government handled -- or mishandled , depending on your point of view -- the situation , ' @entity3 said at a press conference			1
' but considering the dense population of the area @entity5 impacted and costs to the economy , housing , and businesses , the damage done ' was much larger in @entity5 than @entity115 , and that puts this entire conversation , i believe , in focus , ' @entity3 said			1
devastation : the governors of @entity10 and @entity122 say the estimated cost of @entity5 is $ 71billion , more destructive than @entity6			1
pictured is @entity125 in @entity122 deluge : surf rolls past a destroyed roller coaster wrecked by @entity5 , which killed at least 121 people derelict : a roller coaster sits in the ocean after the @entity133 in @entity134 collapsed when @entity5 hit governor @entity135 said the damage done ' was much larger in @entity5 than in @entity6 ' neighboring @entity122 , which saw massive damage to its transit system and coastline , suffered at least $ 29.4billion in overall losses , according to a preliminary analysis released by governor @entity143 's office friday			1
the preliminary cost estimate includes federal aid @entity122 has received so far			0
by some measures , @entity5 was worse than @entity147 and @entity148 , which tore into the @entity26 @entity149 in 2005 , @entity3 said			1
@entity5 destroyed 305,000 houses in @entity10 - a still provisional number that 's likely to grow - compared to the 214,700 destroyed in @entity152 by @entity6 and @entity148			1
@entity5 also caused nearly 2.2 million power outages at its peak in the state , compared to 800,000 from @entity6 and @entity148 in @entity152 , and impacted 265,300 businesses compared to 18,700 , @entity3 said			1
@entity5 hit relatively late in the season , touching ground on october 27			0
@entity6 hit the @entity160 in the last week of august , 2005 , and was followed just a few weeks later by @entity148			0
because @entity148 came so quickly after @entity6 , it 's wrath further hindered the reconstruction from @entity6 so many of their official damage totals have been grouped together			2
cost of recovery : the latest government estimates place the total cost of @entity5 recovery at $ 71billion covering all of the damaged areas , while @entity6 and @entity148 retain their position as the costliest hurricane in @entity26 history tallying up to $ 108billion			1
@entity172 : there is no comparison in this category , as 121 people died as a result of @entity5 , which is just six per cent of the 1,833 lives lost in the 2005 storms			0
homes destroyed : @entity3 's main talking point is that the structural damage that was caused by @entity5 was more expansive than @entity6 and @entity148 , and the numbers support that theory			1
@entity5 is cited for the destruction of 305,000 versus the 214,700 caused by @entity6 and @entity148			1
businesses impacted : the dense nature of the impact area of @entity5 resulted in 265,300 businesses being affected as compared to 18,700 in 2005			0
power outages : while most of @entity193 got their power back four days after the storm , thousands remain without power exactly one month on			0
there were 2,190,000 reported outages this year as compared to the 18,700 from @entity6 and @entity148			0
@entity6 : the majority of the damage was limited to @entity201 in 2005 @entity5 made landfall in @entity122 on october 29 , blasting through the @entity26 , devastating homes , forcing evacuations , crippling power systems and shutting down @entity39 's subway system for days			1
the total cost to the region is still not known as estimates of the damage , as well as future repair and prevention costs , continue to come in from all levels of government			0
@entity39 mayor @entity215 said on monday he will ask @entity216 for $ 9.8billion to pay for @entity5 costs not covered by insurance or other federal funds			2
in a letter to @entity10 's congressional delegation , @entity215 said public , private and indirect losses to the city from the devastating late - october storm stood at $ 19billion			2
@entity125 in @entity122 : smaller coastal communities were among the hardest hit by @entity5 of that , private insurance is expected to cover $ 3.8billion , with @entity229 reimbursements to cover at least an additional $ 5.4billion , @entity215 said in a statement			1
the city still will need the additional $ 9.8billion to help pay for costs that @entity229 does not cover , like hazard mitigation , long - term housing , shoreline restoration and protection efforts , he said			0
whatever the final tally , officials are beginning to pressure @entity216 for federal assistance			0
@entity3 met on monday with the state 's @entity216 delegation and county officials			0
@entity26 senator @entity243 said in a statement that @entity10 's @entity216 delegation will push hard for additional federal funding			0
flooded : @entity10 's infrastructure was severely affected by flooding , fires , electricity blackouts and wind damage ' the federal government has a clear responsibility to commit all of the necessary resources to help us rebuild , ' she said			2
getting federal funds could be a tough fight , because of pressure on lawmakers to cut spending and raise taxes in order to shrink the federal deficit			0
' this will be an effort that lasts not weeks , but many months , and we will not rest until the federal response meets @entity10 's deep and extensive needs , ' said @entity26 senator @entity270 in a statement			0
@entity3 's earlier estimates had pegged the total amount of damages for the region at $ 50billion , with about $ 33billion of that incurred in @entity10			1
in @entity39 , @entity215 said on monday they had about $ 4.8billion of uninsured private losses , $ 3.8billion of insured private losses , and $ 4.5billion in losses to city agencies			0
reconstructing the city 's damaged roads alone could cost nearly $ 800million , @entity215 said			0
@entity39 , a financial and tourism center , also lost about $ 5.7billion in gross city product , he added , included in @entity3 's nearly $ 9.1billion of mitigation costs are what he called ' common sense ' actions , like flood protection for the @entity292 , roads , subway tunnels and sewage treatment plants , as well as power generators for the region 's fuel supply system and backup power for health care facilities			2
' we will see new projects , ' said @entity303 , former president of the @entity305 's @entity304 watch the video here			0

figure for @entity10 and @entity122 damage jumps from $ 50bn to $ 71bn
' in some ways worse than @entity6 ' , says @entity10 governor @entity3
