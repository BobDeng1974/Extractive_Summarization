@entity0 says its testing has found no link between its @entity4 's brand frozen mixed berries and a national hepatitis a outbreak			1
the health department continues to investigate how 34 people in six states contracted the hepatitis a virus , all of whom consumed the same brand of frozen mixed berries			1
@entity0 said no hepatitis a virus or @entity17 were detected in any sample of its recalled and non-recalled @entity4 's mixed berries 1kg product during its own testing			1
managing director and ceo @entity21 said the company 's microbiological and viral testing does not confirm any link between @entity4 's @entity27 and the virus and shows no systemic failure of its quality assurance programs			1
' if our @entity4 's product was the source , the lack of laboratory findings from the testing conducted by @entity0 for the presence of @entity17 , coliforms or @entity36 indicates there has been no systemic failure , ' he said in a statement on wednesday			2
' regardless , @entity0 has significantly increased protection measures to ensure that any risk is further minimised in future			0
' no evidence of @entity36 or @entity17 was found in re-tests of all batches of frozen berries that were not subject to the recall			2
@entity36 ( pictured ) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands , water or food , and then enters a person 's mouth			0
the company said one of two opened sample packs from consumers who contracted hepatitis a did test positive for @entity36 in health department testing but it may have been open to contamination			2
a trace amount of @entity36 was detected in one of eight random sample packs from supermarkets but the department noted that only demonstrated the virus was present , not whether it was alive and could cause infection , the company statement said			0
a health department spokeswoman said its investigation is ongoing with the source of the hepatitis a virus still unconfirmed and the same brand of frozen mixed berries the only common exposure for all cases			0
@entity0 is again supplying its non-recalled @entity4 's and @entity111 berries varieties onto supermarket shelves but only after each batch tested negative for @entity36 and @entity17 , mr @entity21 said			1
he said @entity0 was keen for a locally sourced berry range but it could take some time to develop the required infrastructure and crop volumes			0
several @entity33 hospitals have been told to dispose of chocolate mousse , which has been found to contain listeria			0

@entity121 *insists* testing has *n't* found link between their berries *&* @entity36
there was a national @entity36 outbreak in *january* which *resulted* in 34 people in six states contracting the virus
all 34 people who contacted @entity36 had consumed the @entity44 - grown berries
the 1kg product remains off supermarket shelves until further notice .
the company says there was no systemic error but confirm they are considering alternative supply sources
