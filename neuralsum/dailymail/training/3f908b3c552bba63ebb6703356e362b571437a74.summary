@entity1 boss @entity0 has warned his starstruck players there must be no selfies or souvenir hunting when @entity7 ’s megastars arrive in the small @entity9 town on saturday			1
the club with the @entity12 ’s greatest tradition for giant - killing comes up against @entity15 ’s multi-millionaires in a classic third round encounter			2
even @entity1 skipper @entity17 is a self - confessed @entity7 fan , but @entity0 is determined that while his side might be bottom of @entity21 having lost their last three games , nothing will get in the way of attempting to add another scalp to the club ’s unique history			1
in their days before we got into the @entity21 they knocked out 17 @entity21 clubs , and you have to feel it would be good to add to that story if we can against one of the biggest clubs in world football			2
‘ that ’s only going to happen if we are totally focused			0
if you are taking photos and talking to people about swapping shirts later you are not in game mode			0
’ @entity0 ’s rules will have to be laid out especially to 24 - year - old captain @entity17 , who admitted : ‘ the boys have been teasing me about whether i will be wearing a @entity7 shirt under my @entity1 kit			1
‘ i played against them several times when i was with the @entity58 academy			0
when i was about 10 i hit the post for what was nearly an own goal and i can remember thinking , “ damn , i nearly scored for @entity7 ”			0
' to get one in the right end but against them now , and especially a winner , would be fantastic			0
’ if he did that , even his manager would let him take a selfie to celebrate ! @entity1 captain @entity17 ( left ) will be hoping to lead the @entity21 strugglers to a shock win on sunday			1
