by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 12:42 est , 14 march 2013 a man died after suffering massive burns from a fire that ripped through his terraced home when he lit the sitting room fire			1
@entity6 , 27 , did not realise that the gas canister in his back yard was leaking , causing fumes to drift throughout his house whenever the kitchen door or window was opened			1
soon after he turned on his gas fire in september last year , vapours wafting through his house caused a huge ' flash ' blast which ripped through his property			2
@entity18 , 29 , died 11 days after fire ripped through his terraced home in @entity21 , @entity22 today an inquest into mr @entity6 's death heard how he told firefighters who came to the scene that the gas canister ' was supposed to be empty '			1
he died in hospital 11 days later			1
mr @entity6 , who shared the terraced house in @entity21 , @entity30 , with his father , had kept the cylinder behind the house for up to three years			1
he was not aware that the @entity35 container , of the type used for barbecues , still had gas in it and that its valve was partially open , allowing deadly butane gas to seep through the house			2
the fumes - which are heavier than air - remained at ground level and wafted across the yard and through the terraced property when a door or window was opened			0
the inquest in @entity49 heard how on the evening of september 7 , mr @entity6 switched on the fire in his sitting room			1
at 7.40pm , a spark from the fire suddenly ignited flames which tore across the living room carpet , through the kitchen and out into the yard , where some rubbish caught fire			1
mr @entity6 was at home in @entity21 by himself when the accident happened last autumn , and neighbours called 999 mr @entity6 , who was thought to be outside in the yard when the explosion happened , suffered 46 per cent burns to his torso , upper body , and face			1
firefighters were summoned by neighbours who reported hearing an explosion , and they found mr @entity6 hobbling out of the house			1
watch manager @entity73 said : ' he had no clothes on the top half of his body , his hair was singed and there were burns to both his arms			0
' i think he was in shock but was talking relatively coherently			0
' he said : " it was supposed to be empty " and " there was n't supposed to be anything in it "			0
' mr @entity6 was initially taken to @entity87 before being transferred to a specialist burns unit at @entity89 , @entity90			1
he died on september 18 from respiratory distress syndrome , a lung infection caused by reaction to traumatic injuries such as burns			2
fire incident intelligence officer @entity96 , who investigated the accident , said the valve on the canister had been loosened , allowing the gas to be sucked into mr @entity6 's home			1
he said : ' butane gas would have been released			0
this type of gas is twice as heavy as air and acts very much like water , staying close to the ground and finding any available space			0
' it flows like water until it finds an ignition source			0
the flames flashed back from the lounge , into the kitchen and into the yard			0
' it would n't have taken a lot of gas to spread quickly through the house			0
the canister itself did not explode , it was the released gas			0
' for it to ignite it would have needed to be in concentrations of between two and 10 per cent and would need to come into contact with a naked flame , in this case the gas fire in the lounge			2
' there will have been a sudden flash explosion which swept through the house and yard			0
' mr @entity96 said that mr @entity6 's bath was running upstairs when firefighters arrived , which indicated that he was looking to cool his burns down after the explosion			1
recording a verdict of accidental death , @entity30 coroner @entity137 said : ' it does n't explain why the valve was open			1
it was a very very tragic accident in the most unusual circumstances			0
' after the hearing a neighbour said : ' there was a massive bang that evening and the fire engines were there within a couple of minutes			0
' i saw @entity6 on the street , he was shirtless and being attended to			2
it was a shock when we heard he had died			0
' after the inquest , fire chiefs said that people who handled butane and propane gas should treat it with care .			2
