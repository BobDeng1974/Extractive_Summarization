the skeletons of a mother and her child buried side - by - side are among those which are to be excavated from an ancient burial ground after being disturbed during construction for @entity9 's @entity8			1
archaeologists have started excavating 3,000 skeletons from @entity13 burial ground , which is at the site of the new @entity15 that will serve the @entity17 rail network			1
used from 1569 until at least 1738 , including during the @entity20 in 1665 , the burial site - also known as @entity13 and the @entity19 - was opened after graveyards around @entity9 started to overflow			1
it was situated in close proximity to @entity13 - the first dedicated psychiatric institution in @entity25 – and was used to bury @entity9 ’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as inmates from the asylum			1
most of the remains are unidentified since the site did not keep its own burial records when it was used between 1569 and 1738 archaeologists have started excavating 3,000 skeletons ( pictured ) from the ancient @entity13 burial ground these two adult skulls were among thousands uncovered at the @entity13 burial ground , which was used during the @entity20 in 1665			1
the remains will be removed over the next week by a team of archaeologists a team of 60 archaeologists will work in shifts , six days a week , to excavate the skeletons and gather any other remains at the burial site			1
the skeletons ( pictured above ) will then be reburied on consecrated ground the site , which was uncovered by @entity8 workers who are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial ground , is thought to contain the remains of a former lord mayor of @entity9 , a notorious criminal and political activists			1
the skeletons will be excavated over the next four weeks by a team of 60 archaeologists who will work in shifts , six days a week			1
they will carefully remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be , in archaeological terms , @entity9 's most valuable 16th and 17th century cemetery site			1
after the excavation , the workers will then dig through medieval marsh deposits and @entity83 remains including a road that runs under the site , which has already yielded several interesting @entity83 artefacts such as horseshoes and cremation urns			2
the skeletons will then be reburied on consecrated ground			0
archaeologists are expected to finish on site in september , after which construction will proceed on a new eastern ticket hall by contractor @entity94			0
@entity95 , @entity8 lead archaeologist , said : ' this excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century @entity100			0
' the @entity13 burial ground spans a fascinating phase of @entity9 's history , including the transition from the @entity106 - period city into cosmopolitan early - modern @entity9			1
' this is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in @entity9			2
' @entity13 was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city			0
' archaeologists at the new @entity116 station ( pictured ) are expected to finish on site in september the remains were uncovered during @entity8 construction work , which is set to be completed by 2019 bones and skeletal remains could be seen at the @entity13 burial site today as workers began excavating them the @entity13 burial ground opened during @entity9 ’s response to the plague crisis in the 16th century the burial site was the first in @entity9 which was not associated with a parish church and so many remains are unknown			1
workers could be seen carrying out excavations at the site today ahead of the @entity8 work the @entity8 project has already unearthed a number of exciting discoveries , including more than 10,000 artefacts at more than 40 construction sites			1
in 2013 , workers made an ' unexpected and fascinating discovery ' in tunnels underneath @entity15 , where the historic @entity141 flows			2
the @entity8 team unearthed about 20 @entity83 skulls which were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary			2
the @entity8 team unearthed about 20 @entity83 skulls in 2013 , which had been buried in clusters at @entity13 working under the direction of archaeologists , the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls , as well as a collection of ancient roman pottery			1
for safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground			2
the discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic @entity13 burial ground			1
bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century			0
historically , @entity83 skulls have been found along the @entity172 during various excavations in the region			0
prior to the discovery of the @entity83 skulls , workers also found about 4,000 skeletons buried in the @entity178 area			2
these skeletons were found in august 2013 and were carefully removed during major archaeological excavations last year the archaeological excavations at @entity15 are being undertaken by @entity182 on behalf of @entity8			1
scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern @entity100			0
@entity13 burial ground was established in 1569 to help parishes cope with overcrowding during outbreaks of the plague and other epidemics			1
as well as being used to bury those who were struck down with disease , it also became the site for those who passed away at the nearby @entity13 - which is thought to have been the world 's first mental asylum			2
however , with mental patients showing no physical symptoms of illness , determining which of the remains belonged to those treated at the hospital will be near impossible for experts			0
earlier this year , crossrail - led research identified the names and backgrounds of more than 5,000 people buried at the site			2
names include sir @entity215 , who was lord mayor of @entity9 in 1575 , and dr @entity216 ( also known as @entity217 or @entity218 ) , an astrologer and advisor to the @entity221			0

' pictured : excavations beneath @entity15 an artist 's impression of how the new @entity8 station will look when it is completed the @entity13 burial ground , also known as the @entity19 , was situated near the notorious @entity13 which opened during @entity9 ’s response to the plague crisis in the 16th century			1
the burial site was the first in @entity9 which was not associated with a parish church and it did not keep its own burial records			1

@entity13 : the scene inside @entity13 , as depicted by @entity305 in @entity306 due to the hospital 's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane , a bastardised version of its name - ' bedlam ' - came to signify madness and chaos more generally			0
although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly , most were free to walk around the grounds			0
inside the single - storey building that housed 12 cells , a kitchen , staff accommodation and an exercise yard , inmates were manacled and chained – and treated as a tourist attraction by @entity100 who paid a penny to stare at them			0
patients , usually poor , were given treatments including restraint , dousing with water , beatings and isolation			0
conditions inside @entity13 were depicted by @entity305 in his 18th century drawings a @entity306 , charting the decline of a merchant ’s son from wealthy heir to asylum inmate , via debtor ’s jail			0
in 1674 , the hospital 's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to @entity344 , with the area 's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises			0
@entity13 moved again in 1815 , to @entity349 in @entity350 , which is now the site of the @entity352			0
a final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of @entity356			0
it is now run by the @entity358 and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital .			0
