suicide prevention charity @entity0 has launched a new @entity2 app that enables users to monitor the accounts of their friends for distressing messages a new app aims to help suicidal people by alerting their friends when they post messages online which might suggest that they are considering killing themselves			1
the programme , dubbed ' @entity11 ' , was created by suicide prevention charity the @entity0 , and must be downloaded by individual users who are then able to monitor people they follow on @entity2 for potential warning signs			1
this is done by @entity0 ' specially created algorithm that identifies words and phrases that could suggest depression or suicidal thoughts - such as ' help me ' , ' hate myself ' or ' tired of being alone '			1
@entity23 of @entity0 said : ' social media has changed how we talk to each other			0
it has created a dis - inhibition effect that means people are being more honest online			0
' we know that people struggling to cope often go online looking for support , however , there is still so much we need to learn about why this happens and how we can make the online environment safer for vulnerable people			0
' mr @entity23 said that this new tool would help because rather than placing them directly in front of an organisation , friends can step in to offer help first			0
' by not addressing this issue we run the risk of shutting these discussions down and driving them underground			0
' instead we need to use tools such as @entity11 to encourage people to look out for one another online , helping them to reach out and offer support			0
people will go to friends first			0
' this app and the guidance provided enables them to help			1
' after activation , users will receive an alert via email when a potentially worrying tweet is spotted			2
once a user has logged in , they will be able to see the tweet and confirm whether or not it is a potential worry			2
if a user confirms that a tweet is worrying , information and guidance on how to approach the poster and talk to them is sent out			2
the advice will include tips on how to introduce the idea of contacting @entity0 , but the charity suggested that they would not get involved unless requested to do so by those involved			0
mr @entity23 said that @entity0 were hoping to work with other social networks such as @entity71 as well , but claimed that @entity2 is easier to monitor because it is ' more open '			1
if a user confirms that a tweet is worrying , information and guidance on how to approach the poster and talk to them is sent out			2
file picture @entity78 , from digital agency @entity79 , who created the app , said : ' social media gets a lot of bad press , but we believe there is good to be done			2
' @entity87 , @entity2 's global head of trust and safety outreach , said that the younger generation were the key audience for the new app. ' while the app is aimed at anyone using @entity2 , the key audience for @entity11 is the " @entity98 " group - otherwise known as @entity98 - which typically includes 18 to 35 - year - olds			1
' they are " digital natives " - growing up using new technology and the first generation to grow up with computers in their home			0
' professor @entity105 , from the school of social sciences at @entity108 , explained that a pattern had been found between suicidal language being posted online , adding that the number of suicides highlighted the need to monitor places such as @entity2 more			1
' through social media there has been a normalisation of suicidal language through repeated use online , ' he said			0
' @entity2 is important because past studies have found that a correlation between suicidal statements posted online and resulting suicides exists			1
' anyone with a @entity2 account can activate @entity11 by visiting the website and signing into @entity2 and providing an email address for alerts to be sent to .			1
