description :

Traditional approaches to extractive summarization rely heavily on human-engineered features.
We have used a data-driven approach based on neural networks and continuous sentence features.
The frame-work for single-document summarization composed of a hierarchical document encoder and 
an attention-based extractor.This architecture allows us to develop different classes of summarization models which
can extract sentences or words. We train our models on large scale corpora containing 
hundreds​ ​ of​ ​ thousands​ ​ of​ ​ document-summary​ ​ pairs.
