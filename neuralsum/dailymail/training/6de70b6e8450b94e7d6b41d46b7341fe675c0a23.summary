by @entity0 a young woman who became the face of an organ donor campaign with the slogan ‘ i ’d give you one ’ has died from cystic fibrosis			1
@entity7 , 23 , died before a donor could be found for her			1
she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby and her condition rapidly worsened in recent years			2
ms @entity7 , from @entity20 , in @entity21 , managed to achieve these feats and was put on the transplant list			1
in 2011 she also posed for striking posters for a national campaign for the @entity27 charity			2
the images , showing ms @entity7 , also carried the tongue - in - cheek slogan ‘ @entity30 ? ’ but tragically , her own life - saving donor was never found and she died in hospital on friday with her family , fiancé @entity34 , and puppies , at her side			1
the charity said ms @entity7 was still helping their campaign despite her death as 77,000 people have now viewed their @entity42 page			1
ms @entity7 was the face of an organ donor campaign with the slogan ' would you give her one ? ' @entity47 , @entity27 ’s chairwoman , said : ‘ we were devastated to hear that our wonderful ambassador @entity7 passed away whilst awaiting a lung transplant			1
‘ she was a role model for many people			2
she fought her way on to the transplant list and battled hard to remain here for that call and second chance			1
cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus			0
symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough , recurring chest infections and failure to thrive			0
as the condition develops , a lung transplant may be required			1
there is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long - term damage caused by infections			0
the most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs , and antibiotics to treat infections			0
the condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build - up of mucus			0
for a child to inherit the condition , both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene			0
in this situation , there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes , a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer , and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition			0
about one in every 2,500 babies born in the @entity111 are born with cystic fibrosis			0
as treatments have improved , the outlook for these children has improved dramatically			0
life expectancy remains in the 40s			0
source : @entity119 ‘ like many others , i was in awe of @entity7 ’s determination and resilience and immensely grateful for the fantastic support she gave @entity27			1
‘ she was dedicated to raising awareness of organ donation , not least during our “ i ’d give you one ” campaign which made a significant impact over the past couple of years			1
‘ over 77,000 people have reviewed our @entity42 posting and more than 560 people have shared it on their timeline , so we hoped that @entity7 continues to inspire people to “ think about it , talk about it and do something about it ” as it would be the finest tribute to her			1
’ posting on a tribute page ‘ the @entity7 @entity145 ’ mr @entity34 , 26 , said : ‘ this page has been set up in memory of my inspiring fiancée @entity7 @entity148			1
‘ although her time with us was cut far too short she managed to make some amazing friends and raise an incredible amount of awareness for both cystic fibrosis and the desperate need for organ donation			2
‘ myself and her family are passionate that all of @entity7 ’s hard work does n’t go to waste so we will continue her legacy even after she ’s gone			1

‘ i ca n’t believe we never got to walk the puppy dogs on the beach & we were only talking about it the other week ... ‘ i ’ll make it my mission to live life how you ’d have wanted me too			0
will miss you loads sweet but we ’ll meet again			0
until then , party hard up their my angel			0

ms @entity7 was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was a baby but her condition worsened recently when she was first put on the transplant register , she took to her blog to put up posts of her hopes for the future			1
she wrote : ‘ before i was listed , i was seeing myself going downhill fast , day - by - day			0
yet there was no hope to cling onto , no light at the end of the tunnel , i was absolutely stuck in limbo but i still kept the belief and i carried on			0
‘ but now it ’s different , no matter how ill i feel or how much of a bad day i am having , i have that hope of a call , and that is something i can hold onto because a call could come at literally any second , it ’s exciting but damn right nerve - wracking at the same time ! ! ! ’ to visit the @entity42 tribute page , click here .			0
