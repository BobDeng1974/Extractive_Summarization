@entity0 will take another small step in his comeback to competitive swimming when he competes in two races ; but this time he will do it without the presence of his friend and greatest rival			1
the 28 - year - old competed for the first time since retiring after the @entity10 when he plunged back into the pool at a @entity13 meet in @entity14 last month			2
he was narrowly beaten in the 100 metres butterfly by @entity16 , his uber - competitive team mate whom @entity17 credits for driving him to greater heights			2
shock : olympic swimmer @entity0 came out of retirement to compete in a @entity13 in @entity14 that loss only helped the competitive juices to start flowing again in an ominous warning to his rivals that he has his heart set on greater goals			1
on friday , @entity17 will again compete in the 100m fly at a @entity13 meet in @entity31 , @entity32 , but without @entity16 , who is taking a break to overcome a minor injury			2
@entity17 will also compete in 200m freestyle , an event he won at the @entity37 when he captured a mind - boggling eight gold medals , but dropped from his programme for @entity42			2
@entity17 has not said what his long - term plans are this time , insisting he is simply testing the waters to see if he still enjoys the grind of training , but he has not ruled out the possibility of competing at the @entity51 in @entity52			1
going for gold : @entity17 is the most decorated olympian of all time with 22 medals as the most decorated @entity17 of all time with nothing to prove , @entity17 is unlikely to take on another massive programme but could still add to his golden stockpile with a reduced schedule			0
although he was beaten in the 100m butterfly in @entity14 , he did enough to qualify for a place at this year ’s @entity66 national championships in @entity67 , which double as the selection event for next year ’s world titles in @entity70			0
the 100m butterfly is one of two individual events that @entity17 won at three successive @entity10			0
and if he qualifies for the event at @entity52 , he will automatically make the @entity66 men ’s medley relay team , which has never been beaten at the @entity10			0
@entity17 is unlikely to swim the more gruelling 200m freestyle at @entity52 but would be an automatic pick for the 4x200m relay team , as long as he qualifies			0
he faces stiff competition winning the 200m freestyle at @entity31 against a field that includes reigning @entity84 champion , @entity83 of @entity85 , who now trains with @entity17 in @entity86			0
but results matter very little in the early stages of his comeback and a qualifying time for the nationals could be all that @entity17 wants for now			0
despite his staggering achievements , @entity17 and long - time coach @entity92 have always been coy about revealing their plans and nothing has changed			1
they have still not said when he will race again after @entity31 , saying only that their next plan was to head to @entity101 for intense high - altitude training			1
rivalry : @entity17 competed and lost out to former team mate and friend @entity16 in @entity14 secretive : @entity106 and his coach @entity92 has refused to divulge their long - term plans			1

@entity0 will take part in two races at a swimming @entity13
@entity17 has refused to reveal his plans for the long - term
he will head to @entity101 with coach @entity92 for high - altitude training
