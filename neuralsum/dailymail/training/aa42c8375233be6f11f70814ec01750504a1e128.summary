when @entity1 had finished , it became clear that he had splattered a few egos across the four walls of the visitors ’ dressing room at @entity6			1
‘ @entity13 ’ he labelled @entity8 's players after they failed to show a response to a goal scored by @entity12 ’s evergreen striker @entity11 in the 52nd minute			1
it is impossible to disagree			0
@entity1 had every right to tear into them because he expected something vastly different to this when his summer spending soared beyond £ 100m			0
where has their crisp passing game gone ? what happened to the attitude that took them to within two points of winning the @entity27 title ? bring it back , quick			2
@entity8 suffered a 1 - 0 defeat against @entity12 at @entity6 in their first @entity30 away game since 2009 @entity32 scored the only goal of the game to seal three points for @entity12 in their @entity37 fixture @entity32 celebrates his strike from a corner early in the second half that was enough to clinch victory for the @entity43 side @entity12 moved onto three points in @entity37 alongside @entity8 with @entity46 top on six and @entity48 bottom with no points @entity12 : @entity50 7 , @entity51 6.5 , @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 7 , @entity54 ( @entity55 9 , 7 ) , die 7 , @entity56 7 , @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6.5 ( @entity59 82 ) , @entity60 7.5 ( @entity61 90 ) , @entity32 8			1

@entity8 : @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 6 , @entity70 6.5 , @entity71 6 , @entity72 6.5 , @entity73 6 , @entity74 6 , @entity75 5 ( @entity76 81 , 6 ) , @entity77 6 , @entity78 6.5 , @entity79 5.5 ( @entity80 70 , 6 )			1

referee : @entity88 ( @entity89 ) ratings by @entity91 in @entity43 while we are here , there is also the unfortunate footnote to @entity8 ’s fourth defeat and the moment when @entity78 undermined the authority of his manager by refusing to acknowledge @entity8 ’s travelling fans			1
you could hear @entity1 whistling at him amid the bedlam in the stands			0
‘ i do n’t know if he came back out , ’ added @entity1 , but it was clear that @entity78 was already showered and sitting alone on the team bus			0
it was unacceptable , an affront to the couple of thousand or more @entity8 supporters who made the trip to @entity43 to watch their team on a @entity30 night			1
@entity8 ’s players have to give it to them because the stellar names in this squad should be showing signs that they are equipped for the twin challenge of domestic and @entity121 football			1
as yet they are not			0
@entity70 , @entity69 , @entity78 , @entity75 , @entity80 and @entity76 should be loving life at a club who finished runners - up in the @entity27 last season			2
‘ i ’m not happy with the intensity , ’ admitted @entity1 and there is n’t a soul who watched that performance who could possibly disagree			0
@entity72 , who returned to the team for the @entity135 tie against @entity136 last week , was dreadful			0
twice he failed to read the passes of @entity74 , allowing one to roll under his foot and then bizarrely kicking the ball at @entity140 with an attempted pass			0
for this team to be given the runaround by @entity32 - who was exceptional - @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity140 and the rest of the gang at @entity149 ’s disposal is unacceptable			1
@entity78 , as his heat map ( below ) shows , did n't have a touch in the opposition penalty area - click here for match zone from @entity6 @entity78 , as his heat map shows , did n't have a touch in @entity157 's penalty area - click here for match zone from @entity157 the @entity12 and @entity8 teams make their way onto the pitch at @entity6 for the @entity163 contest @entity8 manager @entity1 embraces @entity12 manager @entity149 , both of whom used to be in charge at @entity167 @entity8 's travelling supporters packed into a corner of @entity6 for their first @entity30 away trip since 2009 you only have to witness the celebrations when @entity89 referee ended the agony for @entity8 four minutes into stoppage time to know that			1
this is another famous victory for @entity12			2
@entity181 , then , because @entity179 ’s rampant team - who beat @entity12 5 - 1 and - are up next at @entity182			1
after that , it is on to the @entity185 for the return			2
@entity8 need a crash course in winning football matches , or else this season could soon turn into catch up			1
they were beaten here when @entity32 , @entity12 ’s hard - working captain , was first to react to @entity68 ’s failure to clear @entity71 ’s misdirected clearance			1
this one could n’t possibly be pinned on the @entity8 goalkeeper , but nevertheless @entity32 gobbled up the chance to put @entity12 into the lead			1
they never once looked like losing it			0
@entity77 had the ball in the net early on for @entity8 , but was adjudged offside from @entity75 's cross @entity8 manager @entity1 looked frustrated at an error - strewn opening 30 minutes from his team in @entity43 @entity79 was restored to the @entity8 starting @entity203 in midfield as @entity80 dropped to the bench at times , especially in the first half , @entity8 approached this game like a one - off			1
every chip they had seemed to be on red			0
with victory secured in their opening group game , there was no need to pile forward in search of more glory			2
@entity78 had started well , unaware of the criticism from @entity220 - ‘ i ca n’t help the way i feel about him ’ - in the @entity222 studio			0
others will share his view now			0
he started well enough here , ducking and diving between the role of target man and genuine goal threat until @entity12 ’s defence got to grips with him			1
@entity72 , who started the game at left back as he continues his recovery to full fitness , receives some instructions from manager @entity1 @entity8 striker @entity78 challenges @entity12 's @entity144 for the ball @entity75 attempts an acrobatic effort on goal , but his shot was saved by @entity12 goalkeeper @entity50 his cute little touches on the spin , angling the ball into the path of the onrushing figures of @entity77 or @entity75 in the opening minutes should given him the confidence to make this his night			1
@entity249 was busting a gut , punished for offside when he eventually rolled the ball into the net after two minutes and later booked for a foul in the first half			2
his lunge on substitute @entity55 at the start of the second half could easily have been a penalty			0
@entity8 gave the ball away too cheaply here , surrendering possession on the halfway line when they should have been trying to take the sting out of the game			2
@entity70 and @entity71 watch on as @entity32 gives @entity12 the lead from close range early in the second half @entity32 celebrates his goal early in the second half at @entity6 as @entity68 shows his frustration @entity78 is booked and @entity1 is left with plenty to ponder on a frustrating evening for @entity8 in @entity43 @entity157 manager @entity149 celebrates with his players as the full - time whistle goes in @entity43 @entity149 ’s side has a good record against @entity279 opposition , raising themselves in recent years to record impressive wins against @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 in @entity121 competition			1
@entity68 made a couple of decent first half saves , first from @entity288 ’s curling shot from the edge of the area and then with his feet to stop @entity292			0
at times there was a look of panic about this @entity8 team at times , uncertain in their approach work			2
any more of this and the writing really will be on the dressing room wall .			0

@entity8 beaten by @entity12 in champions league group b clash at @entity6
