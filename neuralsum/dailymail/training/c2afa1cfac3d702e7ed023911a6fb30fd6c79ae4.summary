by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 07:53 est , 18 july 2013 he has been delighting children and adults alike for 350 years with his unconventional methods of dealing with his wife and child , not to mention policemen , doctors and even crocodiles			2
but a killjoy tried to bring the curtain down on a @entity12 when he accused organisers of glorifying child abuse			1
puppeteer @entity15 was stunned when an angry member of the audience interrupted his show at @entity19 in @entity20 near @entity21 to complain about a violent scene involving @entity12 and his baby			1
stunned : @entity15 has been holding punch and @entity24 shows for 25 years , but only now has he been accused of glorifying child abuse mr @entity15 , 63 , said : ' i was doing my second show of the day when it got to the part of the show where @entity12 is looking after the baby			1
' it ’s a knock - about comedy but in my show he does n’t hit the baby , but it ’s part of the fun to think he might			2
' all of the kids in the audience shout out as he puts a bucket on the baby ’s head and looks like he is going to hit it with a club			1
' that 's not the way to do it : a man complained after @entity12 shoved his baby 's head into a bucket and threatened to hit it with a stick the man , who has not been named , first made a complaint to his partner , @entity50 , and then to @entity52 officials			1
mr @entity15 said : ' i could n’t believe it			2
i did n’t think the guy could be serious			0
' i have been doing it for 25 years and it ’s the first response like this i ’ve ever had			0
the earliest recorded evidence of @entity12 can be found in the diary of @entity61			2
after a visit to @entity63 in 1662 , @entity61 wrote : ' thence to see an @entity65 puppet play that is within the rayles there , which is very pretty , the best that ever i saw , and great resort of gallants			0
' in the late @entity72 era the show evolved into entertainment aimed primarily at children			0
ancient members of the cast , such as the @entity77 and @entity12 's mistress @entity78 , were written out due to fears they were inappropriate			1
the term ' pleased as punch ' is derived from @entity12 and comes from @entity12 ’s characteristic sense of gleeful self - satisfaction			2
' the funny thing is that i regularly do shows for children aged between three and 10 and they always understand that it is a silly show			0
it is not real life			0
they have fun shouting at punch and telling him off for hitting everyone			0
' they shout " you should n’t be throwing the baby out of the window " and they find it really funny			0
” in the section of the show that caused the complaint , @entity12 steals the baby ’s sausages but then falls over , which he blames the tot for			1
he then puts a bucket on the baby ’s head and threatens it with a stick			1
mr @entity15 , a former designer , said : ' i thought the man was joking when he first complained the puppet was encouraging child abuse			1
' @entity117 shows have been around for 350 years			0
mr @entity12 chasing the baby is just part of the show ’s heritage			1
' @entity52 member @entity123 met the complainant			1
he said : ' i was completely taken by surprise			0
i was so astounded i just walked away , shaking my head			2
' mr @entity15 said he regularly performs at shows , parties and events as well as regular appearances at care homes			0
he said @entity12 shows are more popular now than when he began in the business			2
he said : ' they are such great fun and it gives children a live experience away from computers and televisions			0
it ’s a really interactive experience that everyone can enjoy			0
' who 's a pretty boy then ? certainly not mr punch , whose antics caused outrage with one member of the audience at a community fete			1
