beefburgers cooked rare can remain on restaurant menus after a judge rejected claims by food watchdogs that they are a health risk			1
a wine bar and restaurant chain had been told to stop serving the burgers unless they took certain safety precautions			1
the ruling by @entity11 , backed by the @entity12 , would have set a precedent across the country			2
perfect serve : @entity17 - based restaurant chain @entity16 s had been told to stop serving rare burgers but appealed against the decision but the company – @entity17 - based @entity21 ’s – appealed against the decision and district judge @entity23 backed its policy			1
she said : ‘ there is a balance to be struck between ensuring the safety of the public and allowing them the freedom of choice that they would wish and have a right to expect			0
’ the decision will be welcomed by food critics , such as @entity34 and @entity35 , who have lambasted efforts by @entity38 ’s food police to ensure meat is cooked through			0
the council wanted @entity21 ’s beef supplier to sear and shave the outside of whole cuts of meat to remove any harmful bugs			2
good vet could save it : the ban was put in place as @entity11 , backed by the @entity12 , ruled it was not safe to serve ' rare ' meat @entity21 ’s argued that its suppliers could be trusted to supply beef that could be safely eaten			1
but @entity11 council ’s food safety chief @entity56 warned of a health risk			0
he said : ‘ there is an emerging trend of eating beef mince raw or rare in all sorts of premises			1
most of them do n’t have the appropriate controls in place			0
‘ this is a ticking timebomb			0
@entity68 , someone is going to go down with @entity69 and there could be a very nasty outbreak			0
we are not saying burgers should not be eaten rare or medium – merely that they should be prepared in a way that makes them as safe as practicably possible			2
