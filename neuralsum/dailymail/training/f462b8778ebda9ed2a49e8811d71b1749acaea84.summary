' on day three i did n't sleep a wink , i just could n't get settled , ' said company director @entity6 , from @entity114			2

my boobs , which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty , soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit , ' he added			0
' they were way too warm and hung on my arm , sending it to sleep and waking me at the same time			0
' by day three the constant swinging motion of his belly forced @entity7 , 45 , from @entity160 to visit his local pharmacy and seek medical help			2
' i unzipped my jacket , exposing my belly and explaining my predicament to the woman behind the counter , ' says @entity7 , dad to @entity168 , five , and @entity169 , one			2

despite the trials and tribulations caused by faking pregnancy , the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity5 said it has made them appreciate what their wives have had to go through ' a few minutes later , with belly strapped firmly in place , i waltzed out of there with a new - found spring in my stride			1
it was wonderful , i could move again			0
' yet despite the trials and tribulations just one week in @entity6 admits to bonding with his ' baby '			1
he told his diary : ' it seems to be taking on a personality			0
it has a name , and its name is bump			0
