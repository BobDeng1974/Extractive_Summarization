@entity1 secretary @entity0 told @entity3 members on wednesday that she expects health insurance rates to increase as the @entity5 takes full effect			1
' i think premiums are likely to go up , ' she conceded under questioning , ' but go up at a slower pace ' than they have already under @entity5			1
president @entity11 famously promised in 2008 and 2009 that his health insurance overhaul plan would lower the cost of health care for an average family by $ 2,500 per year			1
and as a march 31 deadline approaches , the date when @entity17 will face fines if they do n't have medical insurance , @entity0 told the panel that there will be ' no delay ' in enforcing that so - called individual mandate			1
' in fact , we do n't actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014 , ' she said			0
on wednesday , @entity48 chairman @entity47 asked @entity0 if she agreed			2
' i have n’t seen their statements , ' she replied , despite having been on the conference call , ' but there is no delay beyond march 31			0
' @entity27 in @entity55 have castigated the @entity11 administration for failing to delay the individual mandate , even as it has made more than 35 changes to the @entity5 , including some that defy date - specific deadlines in the written in the law 's text			1
one of those changes was a year - long delay in the employer mandate , which requires companies with 50 or more employees to certify that their workers are covered by medical insurance plans that meet @entity5 's strict minimum standards			1
' if you delayed this law because it ’s not workable for businesses , why are n’t you delaying this law because it ’s not workable for our families ? ' blasted @entity79 rep. @entity31 during wednesday 's hearing			1
' how is that fair ? ' @entity83 rep. @entity82 demanded to know how many @entity5 enrollees have paid for their insurance plans , but @entity0 insisted ' i do n't know that ' @entity0 appeared before the @entity3 in a hearing about @entity1 's budget request for 2015 @entity90 @entity89 sen. @entity89 lashed out at @entity1 for its insistence that it is prohibited from delaying for individuals what it has already relayed for large companies			1
' it is puzzling that @entity97 is now concerned with a lack of statutory authority when it comes to delaying the individual mandate , ' @entity89 said in a statement			0
' the administration has already issued nearly two dozen @entity5 delays , including those for big business and the president ’s political allies			2
' @entity89 has introduced a bill that would explicitly give the @entity110 the power to delay that individual mandate			0
in your face : @entity116 sen. @entity89 has crafted a bill that would give @entity1 the authority to push back the individual mandate deadline as far as it likes @entity110 @entity27 are slated to vote this week on a similar bill , but the measure would face a certain veto at the @entity110			0
@entity0 also insisted that she does n't know how many @entity5 enrollees have paid for coverage and are actually insured			1
' i ca n’t tell you because i do n’t know that , ' she told @entity83 @entity27 rep. @entity82			0
the @entity11 administration trumpeted new numbers on tuesday showing that 4.2 million @entity17 have selected medical insurance policies during the open enrollment period but a @entity132 analysis showed that in the seven states which have published both enrollment and payment numbers , insurers have n't seen payments from 21 per cent of those who have signed up			2
if that percentage were to hold true nationally , @entity1 's boast of 4.2 million enrollments would shrink by 900,000			0
@entity47 , a @entity142 @entity27 , said wednesday that the @entity5 ' is not working as it was promised			2
and yet , the president ’s budget doubles down on this law , requesting another $ 1.8 billion for its implementation			0
' democrats , however – including president @entity11 – are insisting that the law is performing as well as it was expected to			0
rep. @entity148 , another michigander who is the @entity147 ' ranking member on @entity48 , charged that ' @entity27 are so invested in making the @entity5 a failure that they are blinded by the successes staring them in the face			0

the @entity1 secretary faced a *hostile* @entity3 panel on wednesday
she conceded that health insurance rates will be higher next year , but *suggested* that they will rise ' at a slower pace ' than they have so far
but despite delaying fines and *penalties* for businesses , she said there would be ' no delay ' for enforcing the @entity5 law against individuals
@entity0 also insisted that she does n't know how many enrollees have paid for coverage and are actually insured
seven states have managed to publish data showing how many new insurance *customers* are paying first - month premiums
