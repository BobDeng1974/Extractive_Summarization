@entity0 have suffered more embarrassment with the admission four of the 12 starts at @entity4 have been wrong for the past five years			1
the problem , which came to light following the recent bet365 @entity7 meeting , comes hard on the heels of the blunder which allowed @entity11 to win last saturday ’s @entity12 despite the sevenlength winner being ineligible			1
the @entity14 disqualified @entity11 on thursday and fined trainer @entity15 £ 250 under @entity16 ( c ) 37 which states it is a trainer ’s responsibility that a horse is eligible			1
@entity20 ( middle ) after winning the @entity22 in 2013 trainer @entity23 will be aiming for @entity25 success for @entity20 at the @entity22 @entity26 at @entity27 however , the sport ’s ruling body have accepted the blame for the accuracy of @entity4 distances which were first called into question by @entity34 following racing on november 1			2
the north @entity37 venue was re-measured on monday and the 3m 1f chase distance , used for the @entity39 , was 78 yards short of the minimum 3m 166yds required for a jumps race to be officially classified as three miles about one furlong			0
@entity15 was fined £ 250 after his horse @entity11 was deemed ineligible to compete in the @entity12 last saturday among the others to be found incorrect were the 3m 1f hurdle of the @entity43 , won in style by @entity45 a fortnight ago , while the 1m 5f bumper course will become 1m 4½f and the 2m 4f hurdle track will change to 2m 4½f			1
trainer @entity23 will target the @entity22 @entity26 at @entity27 on @entity25 with @entity20 after watching the classy grey make all to win the @entity49			2
@entity23 said : ‘ we will look at the @entity51 next and he could run in the @entity26			0
he is entitled to go there			0
a flat righthanded track will suit and i expect his jumping to improve			0

the @entity56 won last saturday *'s* @entity12 despite being ineligible to compete
as a result @entity56 was disqualified and trainer @entity15 fined £ 250 in the *process*
in what will come as an embarrassment to the @entity14 , four of the 12 starts at @entity4 have been wrong for the past five years
