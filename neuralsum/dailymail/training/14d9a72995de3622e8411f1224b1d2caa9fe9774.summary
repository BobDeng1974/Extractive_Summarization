@entity0 made the save , but @entity2 had as much to do with @entity4 's missed penalty as his @entity6 team - mate did			2
@entity7 forward @entity4 stepped up to take a penalty inside nine minutes of the @entity9 but little did he know his @entity11 team - mate @entity2 was signalling to @entity0 which way to dive			0
@entity2 was clearly seen pointing to @entity14 @entity15 to tell him which way to dive and the former @entity18 no 1 duly obliged , leaping to his left to keep out the spot - kick			0
@entity4 and @entity2 are close friends having played together for @entity11 since 2010 , but the @entity7 hitman may have to be more wary about what he divulges to his compatriot in future ... @entity2 ( bottom left ) flags to @entity0 to get his attention as @entity4 lines up his penalty @entity2 then points to @entity0 to tell him which way to dive for his international team - mate 's penalty sure enough , @entity4 went the way @entity2 pointed and @entity0 guessed right @entity0 gets his hand down to thwart @entity4 and keep the score at 0 - 0			1

@entity6 forward @entity2 pointed to @entity0 to signal which way to dive
