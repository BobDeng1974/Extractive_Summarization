@entity0 have announced the capture of @entity3 captain @entity2 for next season			1
@entity5 revealed how @entity0 had been first to react to the veteran @entity3 defender ’s decision to quit @entity8 at the end of the season			1
the club confirmed they had finally got their man on wednesday and a picture of @entity2 was posted on @entity0 's official @entity15 feed along with a welcome message for the @entity3 star that read : ' here 's @entity2 signing his contract			1
' @entity2 is a great champion , ' he said on inter.it			1
' i am extremely satisfied with the completion of this agreement that will bring @entity2 to @entity0			1
' he is one of the strongest defenders in the world , for his characteristics , his international experience , his charisma as a leader will be crucial for the team and the growth of our younger players			2
' he will add value to the club and will be another pillar for the construction of a great @entity0			1
' finally , i want to thank @entity3 , @entity2 and his entourage for his availability and the professionalism shown during the negotiation process			2
' an agreement has been reached on a lucrative three - season deal that will send @entity2 into retirement on a high , in terms of status and earnings , at another of @entity73 's most famous clubs			1
the 32 - year - old 's contract that will be portrayed as being for two years , with an option for a third , but is effectively for three seasons			1
he needs to make a certain number of appearances for the third year to kick in , but it is believed to be so low – barely double figures each season – that it should be a formality			2
with the @entity84 centre back out of contract in the summer and a free agent , he has been able to secure a salary of £ 3m a year after stoppages , despite his best years being behind him			1
it is the equivalent of around £ 6m each season , before tax and other deductions , and means he will have earned close on £ 20m by the time he finishes his @entity94 contract and , in all probability , calls time on his career at the top			1
backing the boys : @entity0 fans will be watching @entity2 next season at the @entity94 all smiles : @entity2 announced earlier this year he would leave @entity3 in the summer a big leap : @entity2 heads in a goal for @entity3 against @entity0 in the @entity35 in 2009 winner : @entity2 has lifted 10 major trophies at @entity3 , including the @entity107 last season seeking the exit ? @entity109 ( right ) could also leave @entity3 for @entity0 in the summer the combative defender has proved an inspired signing since arriving at @entity8 from @entity112 for £ 7million in january , 2006 , but is in danger of bowing out on a low after a dismal season for @entity3 on the domestic front and calamitous performance in @entity36 last week			1
however , @entity0 are not faring too much better in @entity117 where they are fifth , 11 points off the @entity35 places			2
and @entity0 might not be done there , with @entity109 also on the @entity123 side 's wishlist			1
like @entity124 , 32 , will also be out of contract at @entity3 in june and so far the floundering @entity107 champions have showed no inclination to offer him a new one			0
