however , after @entity1 's use of the controversial programmes were admitted by the government in december last year , they immediately became legal			0
that means @entity10 is now free to carry on using data harvested by the @entity4			1
citizens who thinks their communications were intercepted by @entity10 prior to december can complain to the @entity7 and potentially have any records deleted			1
it is the first time the tribunal has ruled against an intelligence agency in its 15 - year history			0
the judges said that before december it was illegal for intelligence chiefs to use information swept up by the programmes because the public were unaware of the safeguards in place			0
but when additional details about the bulk surveillance programme – just two paragraphs – were disclosed , this was sufficient to make the practice compliant with the @entity62			0
@entity63 said that prime minister @entity64 believes the government should make sure that the intelligence agencies ' continue to have the powers they need to keep us safe ' human rights groups @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 launched the legal challenge against @entity10 following leaks by @entity4 fugitive @entity75			1

the tribunal believes the limited safeguards revealed during last year 's legal proceedings are an adequate protection of our privacy			0
@entity111 , deputy director of @entity71 , said : ' we must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programs using secret interpretations of secret laws			0
' a @entity10 spokesman said : ' the @entity7 has found against the government in one small respect in relation to the historic intelligence - sharing legal regime			1
' the ruling re-affirms that the processes and safeguards within the intelligence - sharing regime were fully adequate at all times - it is simply about the amount of detail about those processes and safeguards that needed to be in the public domain			1
' @entity63 said the judgment did not require @entity10 to change its operations			2
a spokesman said that prime minister @entity64 believes the government should make sure that the intelligence agencies ' continue to have the powers they need to keep us safe '			0
' the overall judgment this morning is that the @entity1 's interception regime is fully lawful			2
