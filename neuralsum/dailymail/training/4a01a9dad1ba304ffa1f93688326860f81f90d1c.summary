animal rights activists have warned people in @entity2 against giving money to beggars asking for money to help mutilated animals			1
these pictures claim to show a camel deliberately mutilated to get people to feel sympathetic and donate more money , apparently towards its upkeep			2
the camel and two beggars were photographed in the city of @entity19 , @entity13 province , south - east @entity2 , where police confirmed mutilating animals was now the new trend			1
animal rights activists say such beggars are scammers that mutilate animals mutilating people , they said , no longer seemed to gather as many generous donations , with people more often making a wide berth around limbless beggars			1
police were unable to take any action against the gang as they had n't broken the law			2
the camel has been used for begging since at least april and , according to local media , brings in lots of cash			0
the men claimed that the camel was a wild camel that they had rescued after it had been run over by a train			1
they denied mutilating it , saying they had taken it upon themselves to care for it and needed the money for food			0
but police say the story is a sham and it 's almost certain the men or their contacts hacked off the camel 's hooves themselves			0
animal cruelty : the men claimed that the camel was a wild camel that they had rescued after it had been run over by a train			1
they denied mutilating it , saying they had taken it upon themselves to care for it with just 600 wild camels left in north - west @entity2 's @entity77 desert , and 800 in the deserts of @entity79 , their survival in the world is seriously at risk and they are supposedly strictly protected			2
in practice though there is rarely any action against people who trap the animals , mainly because of the difficulty in proving they are not domestic animals			0
the mutilation of this camel is the latest argument by animal rights activists for @entity2 to change the law on the torture of animals , in a country where cruelty to animals is not illegal			1
change in the law : the mutilation of this camel is the latest argument by animal rights activists for @entity2 to change the law on the torture of animals , in a country where cruelty to animals is not illegal animal rights campaigner @entity104 said : ' you can see that the animal was obviously mutilated some time ago because the wounds are now healed			2
' my information is that they get a large amount of money every day from people shocked by what they see and in effect they are rewarding these criminals for torturing the animal in the first place			0
' but when police turn up all they can do is maybe move them on or fine them for begging , but nothing else			0
and that will remain the case until we get laws protecting animal rights			0

@entity2 has no law against cruelty to animals so these men ca n't be *punished*
mutilating animals is a new trend among beggars , according to police
they used to mutilate themselves , but people are no longer sympathetic
the men claimed it was a wild camel that got run over by a train
