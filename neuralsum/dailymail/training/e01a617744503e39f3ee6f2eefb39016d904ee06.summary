by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:26 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 06:04 est , 18 june 2013 the @entity2 faces a new tidal wave of casino - style betting machines in bookmakers after a court kicked out a vital test case yesterday			1
the warning came after @entity10 - which already has 81 betting shops including 18 on a single street - tried to prevent gambling chain @entity12 from opening yet another one			1
but a judge sided with the chain , saying there was no evidence that the outlet would attract violence , underage gambling and street drinking - despite powerful evidence that this is already happening in and around other betting shops			1
the judge has allowed @entity12 to open another betting shop in @entity25 as there is no evidence that connects gambling and anti-social behaviour last night campaigners said the ruling would be a ‘ red rag ’ to other bookmakers who would take more and more councils to court and force their way on to high streets ‘ up and down the country ’			1
they said it also proved that councils were ‘ powerless ’ to act on behalf of their residents to end the scourge of unfettered gambling			1
@entity25 is one of the poorest boroughs in the country , and the @entity50 - based council believes bookmakers are deliberately targeting it with the fixed - odds betting terminals , branded the ‘ crack cocaine ’ of gambling			1
each roulette - style machine allows the user to stake up to £ 100 a time on the spin of a virtual wheel every 20 seconds			0
the profusion of betting shops on @entity63 ’s high streets is blamed on @entity65 ’s controversial 2005 @entity64 , which relaxed planning rules on the opening such outlets			2
last night @entity70 mp @entity69 , who has campaigned against the profusion of the casino machines , reacted with horror to the ruling			2
‘ this court case proves that councils are utterly powerless to stop themselves being overrun by betting shops , and all because of our laissez - faire approach to planning , ’ he said			1
@entity10 already has 81 betting shops including 18 on a single street and tried to prevent gambling chain @entity12 from opening yet another one ‘ this was a high - profile case being watched very closely and i have no doubt now that this will be a red rag to bookmakers to go for it , and take the opportunity to move into high streets up and down the country in even bigger numbers			1
‘ the world will look with bemusement that @entity93 could allow an @entity95 borough to become a mini @entity96			2
’ councillors in @entity25 had voted to block @entity12 from opening a new shop at the site of a former kebab shop claiming it would attract anti-social behaviour and underage drinking			1
it also claimed to have evidence suggesting the primary use of the shop was for @entity105 and not traditional betting			1
however at an appeal against the decision at @entity109 , district judge @entity106 rejected claims that the shop would attract violence			2
he claimed the local authority did not have the power to turn down the application and ordered them to pay £ 33,900 costs			0
that meant the case would not be a landmark ruling that could halt the tide of betting shops opening to house @entity105 across the country			1
his decision yesterday came down to whether betting shops and @entity125 caused violent crime			0
judge @entity106 said : ‘ i find it significant the police did not object to the licence and agreed conditions			0
‘ one would have thought , that if the concerns of the local authority were evidenced and well founded , the police would have said so then and at this appeal			0
’ @entity69 said that it was a travesty that the courts might force local authorities to use tax payer 's money to fight gambling companies in court former treasury minister @entity142 , the local mp for @entity143 , had told the court the @entity150 ‘ destroy people lives ’ and the machines cause users to get angry when they lose and that violence can spill out into the high street			1
but the judge said his evidence was of ‘ very little help ’			1
he said : ‘ while undoubtedly as mp he receives complaints about betting premises , 50 in three years of a constituency of 95,000 hardly proves his assertion			2
’ speaking after the hearing , councillor @entity159 from @entity25 said the decision underlined how little power local councils have in halting the increasing tide of betting shops			2
he said : ‘ we have a major problem with these machines			0
i do agree with people who call them the crack cocaine of gambling			0
we will soon have the most betting shops in @entity50 , outside @entity173			0
‘ but this is not just a problem for us , it is a problem for the whole nation			0
we are not unique we are just at the extreme end of the scale			0
’ mr @entity159 rejected criticism by the judge for ignoring advice from the planning inspector to continue to contest the appeal			0
he said : ‘ i do n’t regret it at all			0
the only thing i regret is that we did not win			0
’ @entity188 campaigner @entity187 , founder of the @entity189 , said the decision highlighted the weakness of the @entity192			0
he said : ‘ the @entity192 refused to support the @entity10 and is failing to uphold the licensing objectives of the @entity194 , so is clearly unfit for purpose			1
’ mr @entity69 said : ‘ it is a travesty that we are allowing @entity12 to use their corporate might and forcing a local authority like @entity25 , which represents some of the poorest people in @entity50 , to use taxpayers ’ money to fight them in court			1
‘ because @entity12 can afford expensive lawyers they have been successful			2
’ he added : ‘ no one is against gambling , but these fixed - odds betting terminals are a menace and we now have a situation where boroughs like this have more betting shops than book shops			1
the mp for @entity218 admitted @entity70 had got it wrong when it relaxed gambling laws eight years ago			0
' i am very clear that the @entity221 was flawed , because it let these betting shops through the back door to saturate our high streets , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity70 have accepted it was wrong but in the meantime the coalition need to act			0
we need to give local authorities the legal power to say : enough is enough			0
’ a spokeswoman for @entity12 said : ‘ @entity12 is pleased that the judge has upheld our appeal and granted the licence			1
‘ we want to fund initiatives that support the local community , particularly around up - skilling , getting people into - and back into - work and social enterprise			0
‘ we would like to set up a meeting to discuss this with @entity10 and the local mp , @entity142 , to enable us to put the money to work as soon as possible			2

@entity10 tried to prevent @entity12 opening a betting shop
@entity246 said that there is no evidence gambling *encourages* violence
campaigners said the ruling would be a ‘ red rag ’ to other bookmakers
