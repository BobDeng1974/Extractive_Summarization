by mail online reporter published : 23:56 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 17:24 est , 12 january 2014 @entity2 has ignited a furious row after placing @entity4 above the @entity5 in a top ten list of ten must - see destinations in its latest @entity10 edition			1
the decision provoked outcry as the @entity15 attraction is on the list of @entity17 and one of the richest marine environments on the planet			2
and there was further grief as a review described ninth - placed the @entity24 – also in @entity15 and a thriving hub of tourist activity - as ‘ brash , trashy , hedonistic , and over-hyped ’			1
taking the top spot : @entity4 is the best attraction in @entity29 , according to @entity2 runner up : @entity15 's @entity5 was pushed into second place in the latest edition of the travel guide @entity33 ( @entity34 ) 2 , @entity5 ( @entity15 ) 3			1
the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) 4			0
@entity37 ( nt , below ) 5			2
@entity38 ( @entity39 ) 6			0
the @entity40 ( @entity15 ) 7			2
the @entity41 ( @entity39 ) 8			0
@entity42 ( @entity34 ) 9			0
@entity24 ( @entity15 ) 10			1
the food and wine trail ( @entity29 ) ‘ surfers prefer elsewhere , and paradise has been tragically lost ’ , the guide claimed			1
to add to @entity50 ' gripes , the travel guide also claims @entity52 lagoon is ‘ saltwater ’ when it is actually chlorinated			0
@entity54 , from @entity52 dive - operator @entity55 , told the @entity56 : ‘ we believe that the @entity5 should be the top destination because it ’s the world ’s largest living organism , it ’s interactive , it ’s engaging and it ’s a natural icon			2
’ ‘ while the @entity4 is beautiful , we have an underwater symphony of thousands of reef fish and corals ’			0
while @entity15 might be aggrieved by the top 10 , it ’s not all bad news , with the capital @entity68 named as country ’s coolest city in @entity2 ’s latest guidebook			1
@entity29 government statistics claim two million people visited the @entity5 in the year ending december 2012 , much less than the 8.2 million annual guests of the @entity77 icon			1
the @entity4 , which supports more than 12,000 jobs , was designed by @entity80 architect @entity79 and opened in 1973			0
@entity81 of @entity82 says it is important to the @entity84 and wider @entity10 tourism that the @entity5 is duly recognised			2
' we need to remind @entity10 what they have in their backyard ... with tourism returning to strength we need it to be number one to get the word out , ' he told the @entity56			0
the full list features three @entity15 destinations , two from @entity34 and two from @entity39 and one each from @entity29 , the @entity97 and @entity36			1
disappointing : however , the guide was scathing about @entity99 and its attractions			0

@entity5 comes in second while @entity37 only makes it to *fourth*
anger in @entity15 as @entity24 is *dubbed* ' hedonistic and over-hyped '
but @entity68 is voted @entity29 's coolest city in latest edition of guide
