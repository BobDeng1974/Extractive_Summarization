but these resilient puppies - who are less than four weeks old - were rescued by a man who jumped into the river and brought them to dry land			1
the ten pups were found in @entity17 - a town to the west of @entity20 were pulled from the water and passed to onlookers by the man who wishes to remain anonymous			1
nine of the puppies survived the ordeal , and their rescuer cared for them for a night before bringing them to @entity36 ( @entity46 )			0
@entity47 of the @entity36 said : ' a man was walking past the canal when he saw the white shapes bobbing around in the water			0
' he immediately jumped in when he realised what they were and was shouting for passers - by to catch the pups as he threw them up to the bank			2
' there were ten pups ; unfortunately one died and the other one has been kept by the brave man 's family			1
brothers and sisters : nine of the ten puppies survived and one is being kept by the rescuer 's family sweet dreams : the puppies were given a cuddly toy , which helps them get to sleep puppy pile - up : the pups have been sent out in pairs to four separate foster homes ' when they were bought in they were tired , but after some food they were fine and were happy dozing			1
' as they are so young we gave them a cuddly toy			0
they appreciate something to snuggle up against as a comfort or they just end up suckling on each other 's paws			2
' it was really a selfless act by the man , but i fear for the mental state of whoever threw the puppies into the water			0
' if anyone ever has any concerns about caring for animals all they need to do is call us for advice			0
' ' they have already gone out in pairs to four separate foster families , each with their own cuddly toy			0
' they will get vaccinations at eight or nine weeks before being put up for adoption			2
