by @entity0 published : 10:09 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 02:56 est , 12 july 2013 the @entity1 has determined the true colour of an alien planet for the first time - a dazzling blue			1
astronomers using the @entity8 / @entity7 telescope said that the planet , known as @entity10 , is a deep cobalt blue , much like @entity12			1
but that 's where the similarities end			0
the planet is a huge gas giant orbiting very close to its host star and its atmosphere is scorching , with a temperature of over 1,000 degrees @entity22			1
the planet 's atmosphere is scorching with a temperature of over 1000 degrees @entity22 , and it rains glass , sideways , in howling 7000 kilometer - per - hour winds it also rains glass - sideways - in howling 7,000 kilometre - per - hour winds			2
at a distance of 63 light - years from us , this turbulent alien world is one of the nearest exoplanets to @entity12 that can be seen crossing the face of its star			1
it has been intensively studied by @entity1 and other telescopes and its atmosphere has been found to be dramatically changeable and exotic , with hazes and violent flares			2
now , it is the subject of an important first - the first measurement of an alien planet 's visible colour			1
the planet 's azure blue colour does not come from the reflection of a tropical ocean , but is due to a hazy , turbulent atmosphere thought to be laced with silicate particles , which scatter blue light			2
earlier observations using different methods have reported evidence for scattering of blue light on the planet , but these most recent @entity1 observations give robust confirming evidence , according to the scientists			1
the planet 's colour will be discussed in detail in a paper in @entity71			0
@entity72 , of the @entity73 , and leader of the @entity1 observing programme and paper author , said : ' this planet has been studied well in the past , both by ourselves and other teams			2

a group of scientists have become the first to determine the colour of a planet outside the solar system - and it has an identical haze to @entity12 ' but measuring its colour is a real first			1
we can actually imagine what this planet would look like if we were able to look at it directly			0
' in order to measure what this planet would look like to our eyes , the astronomers measured how much light was reflected off the surface of @entity10 , a property known as albedo			1
to isolate the planet 's light from starlight , the team used @entity1 's @entity111 ( @entity111 ) to peer at the system before , during , and after the planet passed behind its host star as it orbited			2
as it slipped behind its star , the light reflected from the planet was temporarily blocked from view and the amount of light observed from the system dropped			1
this technique also shows how the light changes in other ways and crucially its true colour			1
@entity126 , of the @entity127 , and another of the paper 's authors , said : ' we saw the brightness of the whole system drop in the blue part of the spectrum when the planet passed behind its star			0
' from this , we can gather that the planet is blue , because the signal remained constant at the other colours we measured			2
' a star field image showing the blue planet @entity26 's star ( centre )			0
in order to measure what the planet would look like to our eyes , the astronomers measured how much light was reflected off its surface @entity10 belongs to a class of planets known as ' hot @entity154 '			1
these massive planets are similar in size to the gas giants in the @entity158 , but instead lie very close to their parent star			0
it is this size and proximity to their star make them perfect subjects for exoplanet hunting			0
scientists know that hot @entity154 are numerous throughout the universe and as we do not have one close to home in our own @entity158 , studies of planets like hd 189733b are important to help them understand these dramatic objects			0
professor @entity72 said : ' it 's difficult to know exactly what causes the colour of a planet 's atmosphere , even for planets in the @entity158			0
' but these new observations add another piece to the puzzle over the nature and atmosphere of @entity10			0
we are slowly painting a more complete picture of this exotic planet			0

the @entity1 has determined the true colour of an alien planet for the first time
@entity10 is a deep blue , much like @entity12 , but a gas giant , with violent *weather* *situated* 63 light - years away
in order to measure what this planet would look like to our eyes , the astronomers measured how much light was reflected off its surface
