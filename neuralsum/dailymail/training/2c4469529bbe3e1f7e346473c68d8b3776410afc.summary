@entity0 said tuesday that the @entity2 government should deport thousands of children who cross the border illegally into the @entity2			1
pressed by @entity6 during a televised @entity8 town hall event , the former secretary of state and possible 2016 presidential candidate bucked her political party by insisting that letting unaccompanied minors remain in the @entity2 is the wrong policy to embrace			1
' they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are , ' @entity19 said , ' because – there are concerns about whether all of them can be sent back , but i think all of them that can be should be reunited with their families			1
' moments later , @entity19 articulated a bottom - line policy that disagrees sharply with president @entity31 's observable priorities			0
' we have to send a clear message : just because your child gets across the border , that does n't mean the child gets to stay , ' @entity19 said			1
' she acknowledged that ' it may be safer ' for children for violence - prone nations like @entity61 and @entity62 to remain stateside , ' but that 's not the answer			0
' @entity19 also said that the @entity2 should help @entity65 secure its own southern border , which abuts @entity62 and @entity67 , as a way to prevent under - 18s from making the trip to @entity71			1
but ' first of all , ' she cautioned			0
' we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide			0
we have children 5 and 6 years old who have come up from @entity71			2
' the @entity8 audience , gathered at the @entity77 in @entity78 , was hushed as @entity19 outlined a policy that she hinted she would implement if she were president			1
many of her other pronouncements drew wild applause from what appeared to be a partisan crowd that @entity8 hand - picked for the occasion			2
she tried to dodge the question at first with claims that she had worked as secretary of state ' to deal with the violence in this region , to deal with border security			0
' but @entity6 pressed her three times for an answer			0
through its budget for the @entity100 , the @entity31 administration has tacitly acknowledged that the problem is growing quickly			0
in 2011 @entity100 took custody of 6,775 children who entered the country illegally without accompanying parents			1
that number was 13,625 in 2012 and 24,668 in 2013			0
the government 's budget for 2014 provided for 60,000 such young border - crossers , but most estimates far exceed that anticipated number			0
national shame : hundreds of children are turning themselves in every week along the @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity65 borders , knowing that they will be processed and then allowed to stay in the @entity2 while their immigration cases are sorted out the federal government will spend more than $ 1 billion this year feeding , clothing and otherwise babysitting the children until suitable adult guardians can be found			1
@entity100 claims 85 per cent of them are reunited with family members , but those are guardians in the @entity2 , not in their home countries			1
the agency has not responded to requests for information about how many of them are themselves illegal aliens			0
few of the children are expected to return to face immigration judges , according to the nation 's largest border patrolman 's union			2
in 2012 president @entity31 announced a policy intended to delay the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity2 > as children before 2007			2
but in a transnational game of ' telephone , ' that policy has been misinterpreted – in some cases willfully so , by ' coyotes ' who make a living secretly transporting immigrants into the @entity2 – to suggest that it would apply equally to newly arriving minors .			2

@entity0 stunned a @entity8 audience on tuesday by saying that the @entity2 should deport thousands of unaccompanied minors who have *flooded* the @entity2 border
' they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are , ' she said
' just because your child gets across the border , that does n't mean the child gets to stay , ' she *warned* parents south of the border
a wave of children , mostly from @entity71 , has *streamed* across the @entity2 - @entity65 border in recent *months*
border patrol authorities process them and then release them to the @entity100
@entity100 says it reunites 85 per cent of them with family members in the @entity2 , but those adults ' own immigration status is a question mark
