often they provide a sanctuary for some of the world ’s most endangered species			0
but one zoo is turning out to be rather a dangerous place for some of its inhabitants , a whistleblowing member of staff claims			2
first , a rare male warty pig brought in to breed with a resident female ended up eating all of their offspring – then fatally injured his mate			1
then an endangered species of monkey fell into a pond where it was attacked and eaten by hungry otters			0
and finally three prize birds found their way out of their living quarters and flew away			0
but the resident female warty pig @entity29 was already pregnant			1
when she gave birth to piglets , @entity26 ate them all then killed her never had a chance : these are warty piglets like the ones that were eaten at @entity27 shortly after birth the whistleblower at @entity27 claimed the deaths and escapes , which have all happened since december , were avoidable			1
but the zoo , which prides itself on its conservation projects , said all three incidents had caused great distress to the keepers			1
the first came after @entity29 , a female warty pig native to the @entity47 , was joined by her new male friend @entity26 last september			1
at the time assistant curator of mammals @entity49 said : ' we hope the ' @entity53 ' takes a shining to @entity29 and the two become proud parents in the future			1
' eaten alive : in the same month , a golden lion tamarin ( like the one above , pictured at @entity27 ) was eaten alive by @entity59 otters after falling into a pond where it became trapped hungry group : the @entity59 otters are a popular attraction at @entity27 , which has more than 7,000 animals a spokeswoman for the zoo , which has more than 7,000 animals , said : ' in november @entity29 showed some subtle changes to her behaviour and keepers alerted our in - house vet team			1
' she showed no physical signs of being pregnant and , as she had not been with a male between july and october , she was well outside the known birth window for this species			1
' when @entity29 unexpectedly gave birth to extremely rare piglets having shown no signs of being pregnant , @entity26 ate them all in their enclosure			1
the zoo worker said : ‘ he then also attacked the mother by eating her rear end			0
she was so badly injured she had to be put down			0
' this meant the loss of a family of rare warty pigs that could have been avoided by keeping the male separate			2
’ @entity91 pigs are so rare that their numbers are unknown ; the species is listed as ‘ critically endangered ’			2
a couple of weeks later an endangered golden lion tamarin monkey escaped and fell into a pond surrounding its island enclosure			0
the whistleblower said : ‘ it was trapped in a drainage valve , and then eaten by @entity59 otters			0
’ the monkey is native to @entity103 , where only 10,000 remain in the wild			0
and a week ago three rainbow lorikeets , usually found in @entity106 , escaped through a hole in their cage and flew off			0
alone : @entity26 the warty pig was seen trotting around his enclosure today two months after eating his partner 's piglets before fatally wounding her devoured monkey : two of the @entity59 otters who ate the rare golden lion tamarin after it fell into their pond , pictured at @entity27 today the zoo worker said : ‘ only two were recovered			1
there is still one lorikeet loose somewhere in @entity123			0
’ a spokesman for the zoo said : ‘ @entity29 showed no physical signs of being pregnant			1
the birth of her litter and the subsequent incident with the male was completely unforeseeable			2
’ she added that the zoo has the ‘ highest standards of animal welfare , education and conservation in @entity135 , as well as world - class in - house veterinary care ’			2
will @entity139 , president of the @entity140 , said : ' wherever wild animals are kept in captivity , accidents can happen			2
' however , tragedies can sometimes be prevented and the behaviour of the male @entity147 warty pig in this case was hardly impossible to predict			1
' males of many species are widely known to be a threat to infants , especially in captivity			0
' it would appear that better understanding of animals ' needs and behaviour may have prevented such a tragedy			2
' the general public have an expectation that zoos know what they are doing , and that they have in place measures to protect their animals and to avoid such incidents occurring			0
' the tragedy at @entity27 is almost certainly not isolated			0
' predictable and preventable ' accidents ' regularly occur and the zoo industry , and the government which oversees the standards , licensing and inspection of zoos , must do more to protect the captive animals for which they are responsible			0
' escaped : in another embarssing incident , three rainbow lorikeets recently escaped from @entity27 and one is still on the loose saddened : the zoo , which prides itself on its conservation measures , said the deaths has distressed keepers			1

the *shocking* incidents were revealed by a whistleblower from @entity27
unnamed *source* said the tragic deaths were ' avoidable ' with better care
@entity26 , a rare male warty pig , was *supposed* to mate with female pig @entity29
on his arrival , zoo staff joked : ' we hope the ' @entity53 ' takes a shining to her '
but unknown to the keepers , the resident female was already pregnant
when she gave birth to piglets , @entity26 ate them all before fatally injuring her
@entity140 say ' better understanding of animal behaviour ' needed by zoos
