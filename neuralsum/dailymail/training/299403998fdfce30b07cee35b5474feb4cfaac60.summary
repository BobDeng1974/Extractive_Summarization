the crew were left dazzled by the bright green laser and decided to track @entity5 using thermal imaging cameras so that police on the ground could arrest him			1
@entity26 @entity32 previously heard the laser created a ' bloom effect ' which momentarily blinded the pilot and could have caused serious catastrophic consequences			1
after he had dazzled the pilot @entity5 then appeared to gesture up at officers and wave beer bottles in apparent celebration			1
but he was foiled when the helicopter tracked him from 1,300ft ( 396m ) and passed his location onto police who turned up 15 minutes later to arrest him			2
