you do n't restrict an artist			0
he 's there to create , to entertain , to slap his imagination on a blank canvas and leave the world wondering how the hell he did it			0
@entity9 used @entity10 as a ' false right winger ' at @entity12 six days ago , and threw off the shackles that were once strapped to his ankles by @entity15 and @entity16			1
the two - time @entity17 showed good things come to those who wait , as @entity21 's 3 - 4 - 3 formation that snookered teams from january onward was lost on @entity24			1
@entity24 midfielder @entity10 scores the second of his double to seal an important win at @entity12 @entity10 's perfect technique for his scissor - kick was brilliant as he scored one of the goals of the season @entity21 could do little to stop @entity10 's incredible scissor - kick giving them a 2 - 0 lead at @entity12 @entity10 runs away in celebration with @entity24 team - mates @entity37 ( right ) and @entity38 ( left ) it was , if nothing else , unexpected			1
@entity10 had gone unused , having played just 15 minutes across four @entity42 games in february , and it was reminiscent of his bit - part role at @entity17			1
@entity16 considered @entity46 a better fit as his no 10 , believing @entity10 's defensive cover left a lot to be desired			2
he is not a tackler , nor is he the physical type			0
you do n't buy a @entity53 then expect it to behave like an @entity55			0
@entity10 is a different breed			0
what he is , is an architect			0
since the start of the 2011 - 12 @entity42 season , he has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder			1
close behind is @entity66 's @entity65 ( 63 ) and @entity67 ( 61 ) , then @entity17 's @entity68 and @entity21 's @entity69 ( both 58 )			1
yet his defensive discipline – or lack thereof – is what @entity16 considered his achilles heel			0
it 's true the midfielder averages the fewest tackles ( 0.64 ) , clearances ( 0.16 ) and duels won ( 14.29 per cent ) per game when he , @entity65 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 are compared , but that 's not his job			1
@entity10 left @entity17 for @entity24 in a £ 37m switch but manager @entity15 never got his money 's worth @entity10 's prayers have been answered at @entity24 as he looks to get a regular run out by @entity9 only @entity65 ( 365 ) beats him in chances created out of the entire @entity42 since the beginning of 2011 - 12 , but @entity10 ( 291 ) has played 466 fewer minutes			1
he 's the creative kind , but would most likely still be warming the substitutes ' bench at @entity91 had he not swapped south for north			0
it was @entity94 that bought @entity10 from @entity17 , phoning him personally to explain what he wanted			2
@entity97 , assists and goals were the demands , and @entity10 agreed			2
two days later , he arrived at @entity101 – by helicopter , no less – and it was confirmed			0
@entity17 made a tidy £ 13.5m from the @entity10 move			1
shrewd as ever , as they were with @entity105 ( £ 31.6m profit ) , @entity107 ( £ 4m ) , @entity108 ( £ 11m ) , @entity109 ( £ 18m ) and @entity110 ( £ 5.5m ) , among others			0
@entity15 , however , never got his money 's worth			1
@entity10 celebrates his goal with team - mate @entity115 at @entity12 on sunday during their win @entity10 has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder in the @entity42 since 2011 it was when he left @entity123 with the club in seventh that the inquest began			1
he had n't kept sir @entity128 's backroom staff			0
he failed to replace @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			0
his style of football was cautious , slow and predictable compared to his predecessor 's attacking outlook			0
another supposed error was wasting £ 64m on @entity37 and @entity10			2
yet the new man at @entity24 is getting what moyes could n't out of both			0
against @entity21 , @entity37 and @entity10 covered the most distance ( 11.6km each ) out of everyone			1
@entity10 had more touches ( 93 ) than anyone else , made 73 passes with 91.8 per cent accuracy , and made hazard proud by drawing more fouls than any other player ( 3 )			2
for a player without a shot on target in the @entity42 since december 20 , he scored two goals worthy of settling the great rivalry			2
@entity155 , lugging five yards behind for @entity10 's first and not tracking him for the second , was tormented by the man that goes by ' @entity10 ' – a suitable nickname handed to him by former @entity17 team - mate @entity161 because it is a literal translation of his name			1
@entity10 's heat map from @entity24 's 2 - 1 win at @entity21 last weekend @entity155 was tormented by @entity10 at @entity12 but the challenge is for him to make it consistent @entity10 runs with the ball during the tense match between the two great rivals of the @entity42 @entity24 's average positions vs @entity21 ( left ) with @entity10 ( no 8 ) drifting inside ... and his total passes ( right ) @entity10 's heat map vs @entity174 on march 15 in @entity24 's 3 - 0 win at @entity176 saw him drift inside jan 1 vs @entity177 - 90 minutes jan 11 vs @entity178 - 90 @entity180 17 vs @entity179 - 45 @entity182 vs @entity183 - 13 feb 8 vs @entity184 - 0 feb 11 vs @entity185 - 0 feb 21 vs @entity187 - 11 feb 28 vs @entity188 - 4 march 4 vs @entity189 march 15 vs @entity174 - 77 march 22 vs @entity21 - 90 against @entity21 , right - back @entity190 was used as cover , sprinting up the wing to allow @entity10 to abandon his post			1
those two exchanged more passes ( 55 ) than anyone else on sunday , and worked in tandem			0
their average positions show @entity10 ( no 8 ) stayed close to @entity200 ( no 21 ) , who was equally devastating at @entity12 , while @entity202 ( no 25 ) pushed up , just short of the half - way line			1
@entity10 played a similar role against @entity174 the week before , as his almost identical heat maps above demonstrate			2
but he is not out of the woods yet			0
@entity10 is flirting with a first - team place , having replaced an out - of - sorts @entity208 , but the trick is to stay there			0
he has been crying out for this , ever since he was phased out at @entity17 , and even more so now he has been dropped by @entity213			0
@entity10 has played 3,724 minutes and made 44 starts in the past two seasons			2
restricted , to say the least , when compared to former @entity17 team - mate @entity68 , who has 5,461 minutes and 61 starts			2
it 's easier said than done to become a must - pick – £ 37m does n't buy you that luxury these days			1
can it happen at @entity24 ? if @entity10 can rip teams to shreds as he did against @entity21 , then how can it not ? trouble is , @entity9 – like @entity16 – is a hard man to please			1
@entity10 has played 3,724 minutes with 44 starts over the last two seasons - far less than his counterparts @entity10 ripped @entity21 apart on sunday as they ended their unbeaten run in the @entity42 in 2015			1

@entity10 *joined* @entity24 from @entity17 for £ 37m last january
the two - time @entity17 ran riot at @entity12 last sunday
@entity9 used @entity10 as a ' false right winger ' against @entity21
right - back @entity190 covered to allow @entity10 to abandon his post
since the start of the 2011 - 12 season , @entity10 has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder in the @entity42
only @entity65 ( 365 ) beats him in chances created since 2011 - 12 , but @entity10 ( 291 ) has played 466 fewer minutes than the @entity66 player
