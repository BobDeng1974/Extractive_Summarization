by @entity0 a team of @entity3 university students have unveiled an audacious plan to become the fourth people in history to land a spaceship on the moon			1
the @entity10 students say their project could even go one better - landing a craft that can take off and land at will , allowing it to explore the lunar surface easily			1
they hope to launch on a commercial spacecraft in 2015 - if they can raise enough money			1
after cruising through space for five days , the spacecraft will land on the surface of the @entity30 , sending back high - res images and videos to @entity10 ’s mission control center			1
after this first lunar touchdown , the team will launch the @entity25 lander from the @entity30 ’s surface and fly it to a second landing site			1
' @entity30 missions take brains , and willpower , and usually the wealth of nations - until now , ' the team says on its fundraising site			1
' brains are still needed			0
' for the first time in history a group of students with a dream , a hell of a lot of support from their school , and your help , will land a spacecraft on the @entity30			2
' the team are battling against far larget teams as part of a @entity62 for the team to land on the moon			0
once their craft has landed , they plan to beam back messages from supporters , while the craft will also be etched with the names of those who supported the project			2
' when the @entity79 hits zero , the first bunch of twenty - something - student - rocket - scientists ( along with professors , advisors , partners and pals ) are going to launch a lander bound for the @entity30			2
' after it lands it ’s going to take off again , fly for a bit , and then land again			0
' this , too , is a first			0
' the @entity10 / @entity25 lander as it would look on the @entity30 's surface ' some very serious math has been done to calculate just how long the @entity25 might last on the @entity30			1
since it will be engraved with or contain the names and messages of everyone who wants to help , the answer is important			0
' our lander will stand post for tens of millions of years			0
the @entity62 , the largest international incentive based prize of all time , aims to do something we have n’t done as humanity since 1973 - safely land on the surface of the @entity30			1
' more than half of the world ’s population has never had the opportunity to view a live transmission from the lunar surface , ' say the organisers			2
the @entity62 aims to create a new “ @entity109 ” moment for this generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $ 40 million in incentive based prizes			0
in order to win this money , a private company must land safely on the surface of the @entity30 , travel 500 meters above , below , or on the @entity25 surface , and send back two ' @entity117 ' to @entity118 the team is confident it can win the @entity62 , awarded to the first non-government group to land on the moon			1
' the launch date is set , the spacecraft design is complete , and at the moment , it looks like the @entity25 team might just win the @entity62 by being the first non-government group ever to accomplish so technical a task			0
' the @entity10 students testing their design the next step in the race is to build and test the lander prototype , the team say			2
in december of 2015 , the @entity25 lander will take off onboard a commercial launch vehicle			0
after cruising through space for five days , the spacecraft will land on the surface of the @entity30 , sending back high - res images and videos to @entity10 ’s mission control center			1
after this first lunar touchdown , the team will launch the @entity25 lander from the @entity30 ’s surface and fly it to a second landing site			1
' we began planning the mission in january 2013 and will finish this phase by july of 2014 , ' the team says			0
an artist 's impression of the craft in space ' during this period , @entity10 researchers will be moving from the design phase in the labs to building a prototype of the @entity25 to do descent , landing , and hopping tests on @entity118			0
' mission control will conduct flight operations from december 2015 to january 2016			2
during this period , we will reach out to the world and release stunning hi - res videos and photos to the public and publish details of the @entity25 ’s achievements before we close out the mission , and our golden lander becomes the monument to all that we have together accomplished .			0

@entity10 team hope to become 4th team ever to land a spaceship on the @entity30
will send back video from the lunar surface - and *replay* messages from its backers
plan to launch in december 2015 - if they can raise enough money
