by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 's former right - hand man has revealed how the new @entity5 boss had talked himself into an instant promotion - moving from potential @entity8 backroom boy to no 1 contender for the top job			1
lifting the lid on a process that saw the relatively unknown @entity15 manager handed control of the @entity18 hopefuls , @entity11 said his close friend and confidant would have been willing to work under a more high - profile head coach like @entity22			1
but @entity11 , former assistant and now interim successor to @entity3 , insisted that @entity5 majority shareholder @entity25 and chief executive @entity24 had been completely won over in the space of a single interview - so much so that they put all their faith in a 38 - year - old who has never worked outside of @entity32			1
promotion : @entity11 believes @entity3 ( above ) talked himself into becoming the new @entity5 boss ‘ he went in to interview for the assistant ’s job and i think he would have taken it , because it ’s such a big job , ’ said @entity34			1
‘ but @entity3 knew within his heart that he could do the top job			2
he went into the meeting and , when he came out , there was no more talk of him being an assistant manager			0
‘ he blew them away			0
the board knew that was n’t an option – he was their man			0
’ @entity3 is guaranteed a rousing send - off as he takes to the field for an emotional farewell at half - time during monday ’s home game against @entity55			2
impressed : @entity56 assistant coach @entity11 claims @entity3 blew the @entity5 board away he ’ll be back in @entity58 by tuesday , ready to start serious planning for @entity18 qualifiers that could yet see his new team pitched against his former employers			1
@entity11 said : ‘ we were on the bus back from our away game last wednesday night and @entity3 and i turned in our seats , looked into each other ’s eyes			1
‘ he said : “ you know we ’re going to end up on the touchline against each other going for the @entity18 ”			0
and we burst out laughing			0
i think it will happen – it ’s destiny			0
it ’s great for us			0
’ meanwhile , @entity76 has edged closer to becoming @entity3 ’s new no 2 after weekend talks in @entity79			2
local knowledge : @entity76 is on the short list to become assistant manager at @entity5 as @entity85 revealed last week , the former @entity5 , @entity84 and @entity58 midfielder is favourite to become the @entity32 ’s right - hand man following a meeting described by sources as ‘ positive and productive ’			1
however , @entity5 chief executive @entity24 says the club are talking to ‘ two or three ’ candidates for the assistant ’s post and @entity85 understands @entity8 development coach @entity94 is also firmly in the frame			2
@entity76 has yet to discuss financial terms and no deal is concluded as yet .			0
