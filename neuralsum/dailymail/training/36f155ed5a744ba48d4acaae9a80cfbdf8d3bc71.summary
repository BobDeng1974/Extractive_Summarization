@entity0 conspired with the @entity1 to buy up cheap land in @entity3 for @entity4 and orchestrate a unique legal situation that makes the theme park above the law , a new book claims			1
the company took advice from former @entity1 agents and lawyers to engineer statutory grounds which still allow @entity4 avoid taxation and environmental regulation , it is alleged			2
the special legal situation underpinning the site is not only unconstitutional , it is claimed , but allows the company to avoid any inconvenient decisions democratically taken at the local level			2
@entity22 : the @entity1 helped @entity4 acquire a unique legal status which makes it exempt from local democratic government , a new book sensationally claims in 2005 the then chief of @entity3 's @entity27 summed up the impunity with which @entity4 operates when he admitted : ' we do n't have the authority to close the park down or close the rides			1
' the allegations have been made in a new book , finding @entity3 : the @entity38 , by investigative journalist @entity37 , extracts from which have been published by the @entity39			1
best known for his work on the @entity1 's ' secret war ' in @entity42 and interviews with world figures as foreign correspondent for @entity46 , @entity37 has now turned his attention closer to home with this expos√© of @entity3 's murky past			2
guests walk by the entrance to @entity0 's ' @entity54 ' show : the company took advice from @entity1 agents and lawyers to engineer statutory grounds which still allow it avoid taxation and regulation , it is alleged impunity : guests wait in long lines at @entity4 's @entity67 ride			1
in 2005 then chief of @entity3 's @entity68 admitted : ' we do n't have the authority to close the park down or close the rides ' in finding @entity3 he claims that @entity0 conspired with @entity76 ' @entity75 - the so - called ' father of the @entity1 ' - to establish a state - within - a - state where he could ' control the overall development ' of @entity4			1
@entity87 , founding partner of @entity84 law firm @entity83 , whose attorneys included future @entity1 director @entity86 , provided lawyers to help @entity0 distract attention from its plans , says @entity37			0
these attorneys , it is claimed , provided fake identities for @entity0 agents , set up a secret communications centre and organised a disinformation campaign to make sure sellers had no idea who was buying their property			0
in this way , @entity0 was from the mid-sixties able to snap up 40 square miles of land in the @entity3 for a knockdown price of less than $ 200 an acre			0
investigative journalist @entity37 's book claims to reveal that @entity4 's creators worked with the @entity1 to circumvent local law			1
at its opening , @entity0 , above , boasted in a recording made before he died about creating a new kind of @entity113 @entity0 and his advisers then sought a way to ' limit the voting power of the private residents ' of the area , to control the impact that local democracy might have on the company 's plans			2
they employed a scheme devised by senior @entity1 operative @entity125 to establish two phantom cities populated by hand - picked @entity0 loyalists around which @entity4 would be based			1
the cities were based around @entity129 and @entity130 , two artificial reservoirs @entity0 engineers created by obstructing the area 's natural water flow			0
the company could then ' use these fake governments to control land use and make sure the public monies the theme park generated stayed in @entity0 's private hands , ' @entity37 writes			0
teams of @entity0 lawyers working out of @entity87 's @entity84 law firm drafted the legislation to establish the two pseudo-cities , which was passed by the @entity3 legislature in 1967			0
puppet regime : @entity4 's @entity148 on the shores of @entity130 , one of two artificial reservoirs around which @entity0 set up phantom cities with local governments the company could control however , in violation of both the @entity113 and @entity157 , the carefully drafted laws specified that any elected office holder must own property within the cities			1
the law , which states that each candidate for office ' must be the owner , either directly or as a trustee , of real property situated in the @entity166 ' , ensured any local politician would be intimately linked with @entity0			0
on the day of the magic kingdom 's inauguration , @entity0 , speaking from beyond the grave in a recorded presentation , boasted of creating a new kind of @entity113			0
' of course he was right about creating a new kind of @entity113 , ' @entity37 writes			0
' by turning the @entity3 and its statutes into their enablers , @entity0 and his successors pioneered a business model based on public subsidy of private profit coupled with corporate immunity from the laws , regulations , and taxes imposed on actual people that now increasingly characterises the economy of the @entity113			2

@entity4 's special legal *arrangements* help it avoid tax and regulation , new book claims
the laws which underpin the two phantom cities it sits on require office holders to own property there
that defies *provisions* in the @entity113 and @entity3 constitutions against such laws
finding @entity3 : the @entity38 , by @entity205 , is out now , published by @entity206 .
