woods ’ first birdie came at the 467 - yard 14th , where he nailed a three - wood to within 10 feet , but he gave that shot back at the next with a poor drive into the left rough			2
a five - foot birdie putt at the next lipped out and he three - putted the 17th for bogey			0
after another dropped shot at the 18th he was four over at the turn			0

however , he was still eight shots off the early lead set by @entity48			1
