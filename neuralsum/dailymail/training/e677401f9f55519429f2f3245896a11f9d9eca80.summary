now there 's a ' squishy ' robot that can be frozen , lit on fire and crushed by a car , and still wriggle away			2
researchers at @entity5 led by @entity6 presented a robot last month that can withstand extreme environments because its body lacks the rigid parts that hinder traditional robotics			1
the project was partially funded by the @entity13 , or @entity13 , a branch of the @entity15 that finances technology projects for civilian and military purposes			1
the new design from @entity5 also improves on earlier soft robot designs with a larger size and the ability to move without being ' tethered ' to an air compressor , meaning it can operate outside the lab. the silicone rubber body can withstand subzero temperatures , outlasting @entity45 in testing in 2013 , when temperatures dropped below -15 degrees @entity48 and winds blew almost 25 miles per hour			1
the prototype still has some rigid components that make the final design weaker			1
the air compressors that inflate and deflate the robot to make it move , as well as a battery pack that provides several hours of energy are exposed on the top			0
the authors state that the next step is to move these components inside the rubber body to protect them			0
some day it may be possible to replace these rigid components with soft ones			2
living color : fluorescent - colored liquid is pumped into one ' soft ' robot , showing the channels imprinted in the soft silicone rubber under the skin : colored liquid can be pumped in an out of channels , allowing the robot to be camouflaged in different environments soft robots are not a new concept			0
one of the first soft robots able to walk and crawl debuted in 2011 and came from the same research lab as the one developed by @entity6			2
a later model could be camouflaged against its surroundings by pumping colored liquid through its body			0
in addition to military use , researchers envision soft robotics being used in more advanced prosthetic limbs and assisting in surgery .			0

a group of *scientists* led by @entity6 presented a robot without rigid components that can handle open flames and subzero temperatures
the project was funded partly by the @entity13 of the @entity15
in action , the robot resembles a dying person crawling on its hands and knees
