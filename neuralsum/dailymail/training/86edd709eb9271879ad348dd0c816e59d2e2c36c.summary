by @entity0 when one very excited 10 - year - old claimed to have found a mummy in his grandmother 's attic , it took his parents a while to realise he was n't making it up			1
but , unfortunately for little @entity10 , from @entity11 , his historic find has proved to be a little less exciting than originally thought			1
it turns out that the supposed 2000 - year - old @entity14 mummy is actually made of plastic , a discovery made after scientists finally unwrapped the corpse for inspection			1
mysterious find : a 10 - year - old @entity21 boy found what appeared to be a mummy in a sarcophagus in his grandmother 's attic experts now claim they were fooled by a chemical spray which made the bones appear real			1
@entity29 , a @entity30 prosecutor who had declared the ' mummy ' was 2,000 years old , has admitted that bone x-rays have proven him wrong			2
' the mummy was unwrapped , and we have seen relatively quickly that the ingredients are not ancient , ' he said			2
in an unexpected and slightly macabre twist , the mummy did contain a genuine skull , though an arrowhead found lodged in it appeared to come from a child 's toy			1
relic : mr @entity10 believed that his father may have brought an unusual souvenir back from a trip to north @entity46 in the 1950s interest peaked the the so - called ' mummy of @entity11 ' after it was found in the corner of an attic last month			1
@entity29 @entity52 , father of the boy who discovered it , theorised that his own father may have bought it while travelling in the 1950s when there was still a mummy trade operating			1
according to @entity10 , ' unwrapping parties ' - where a genuine mummy is unwrapped and the trinkets inside handed out - were not uncommon in @entity21 at the time			1
the sarcophagus was found alongside a death mask and a canopic jar - used to store organs extracted from the deceased - but these were quickly outed as fake			2
@entity10 insisted on having the corpse itself tested though , intrigued at the possibility of it being real , despite some pointing out that the body was bound in 20th century cloth			1
the mummification process dates back to @entity75 with the oldest intact @entity14 mummy dating from 100 years after that			1
the mummy , known simply as @entity79 # 32751 , is currently held by the @entity80			2
it was apparently preserved by direct contact with the dry desert sand , though it is uncertain whether the mummification was intended			2
the only mystery that now remains is why somebody would store a fake mummy in their attic for four decades			2
tradition : ancient @entity92 used to mummify both humans and animals when they died ancient @entity92 were firm believers in the afterlife when someone died			0
but they thought to get there , the body needed to be recognisable , so that the dead person could repossess it			0
the chief embalmer was a priest wearing the mask of @entity103 - the jackal - headed @entity104 of the dead			0
first the brains would be pulled out of the person through the nose using a hook			0
then all the internal organs would removed , including the lungs , stomach , intestines and liver and placed in jars			0
the heart would be replaced			0
the inside of the body would be rinsed with wine and spices before being covered with salt for 70 days			0
after 40 days it would be stuffed with linen to give it a more humane shape			0
at 70 days it would be wrapped in bandages and placed inside a brightly - painted coffin			0
mainly wealthy people were mummified because poorer people could not afford it			0
animals were also sometimes mummified as gestures to the @entity133 or so that they could accompany their owners in the afterlife .			0
