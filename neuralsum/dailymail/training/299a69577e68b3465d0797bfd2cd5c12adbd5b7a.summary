@entity8 is now ten years old and her parents will have to submit their choice of schools in november			0

@entity2 ( pictured in 2007 ) has decided to send his daughter @entity3 to a state secondary school as his wife is ' very keen ' to give her children a ' normal ' education , friends of the couple have claimed one friend told the @entity25 : ‘ she ’s very keen on a normal education for her children			1
her children ’s lives are abnormal enough			2
they have a strange existence as it is			0
‘ being in a state school is a nice antidote to that			2
you get to meet normal children from normal houses whose fathers do n’t go off and spend the weekend with @entity38			1
the children can be socially fluid			2
’ the prime minister has constantly had to battle sceptics who feel that his education at @entity43 makes him ill - equipped to speak for ordinary voters			1
and mrs @entity8 is the daughter of sir @entity45 – a landowner descended from @entity47 she attended the fee - paying @entity48 in @entity49 , where the @entity50 was also educated			2
but her time studying fine arts at the @entity53 in @entity54 convinced mrs @entity8 that her children would benefit from exposure to people of different backgrounds			1
her friend explained : ‘ at @entity54 she loved the fact that no one discussed which school they were from			2
it was all about what you were doing then and there			0
' you were judged by who you were , not who your parents were or where you went to school			1
’ they added : ‘ @entity74 ’s very non-judgmental			0
she takes people at face value and makes up her own mind about people			0
@entity12 is said to want her daughter to meet people outside their usual circle , claiming she wants her children to be judged ' for who they are ' rather than being defined by their rarefied social status or their father 's job ‘ she wants a school where people do n’t make assumptions about you based on the frame of your life , as that stereotypes people in a way that is genuinely unfair			1
’ the decision means that mr @entity2 is set to become the first @entity98 prime minister ever to entrust his children to the state sector while in @entity101			1
details of the couple ’s thinking emerged a week after education secretary @entity105 became the first @entity106 in that post to opt for state school for his daughter @entity109 , who won a place at @entity111 in @entity112			1
@entity113 and @entity8 , as well as her brother @entity114 , currently attend one of @entity117 ’s most sought - after state primary schools in @entity118			0
mrs @entity8 , 42 , is expected to visit @entity119 but friends say the school might be too close to @entity112 for mrs @entity8 ’s taste			0
other options are thought to include @entity124 in central @entity117 and @entity125 in @entity126 , west @entity117			0
@entity127 – one of the first comprehensives in the @entity130 – is also an option , although it is more usually associated with @entity134 grandees like @entity135			0
sources say the prime minister was ‘ very behind ’ sending his children to a state primary school and the couple are ‘ now working towards ’ choosing a state secondary school for @entity3			1
his allies say there is ‘ no reason ’ why they wo n’t make the same choice for their son @entity114 , now eight			0
@entity101 declined to comment but a source said : ‘ the decision is still some way off			0
nothing has changed since the answer the prime minister gave in november 2012			1
’ on that occasion , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i would like my children to go to state schools , that ’s my intention , and i think what ’s happening in the state school system is really exciting			2
‘ what we ’re seeing is something we should have seen years ago which is the flowering of more choice , more competition , more diversity and crucially higher standards			0
i want my children to be part of that and i ’m very heartened by what is happening			0

@entity12 wants daughter to meet people outside usual circle
prime minister constantly has to battle sceptics of his education at @entity43
wants children judged on ' who they are , rather than school they went to '
