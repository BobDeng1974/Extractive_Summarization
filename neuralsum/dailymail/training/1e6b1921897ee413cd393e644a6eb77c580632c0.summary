who was the best centre half in the @entity2 at the weekend ? obviously it was @entity4			2
and with @entity6 struggling to find a partner for @entity8 , the solution presents itself right in front of @entity11 ’s eyes			1
@entity14 ’s six - game winning streak has coincided with @entity4 ’s return , and while the finishing of @entity17 and @entity18 , along with the sometimes stunning goalkeeping of @entity20 , have all been crucial in @entity14 ’s run of results , @entity4 has been vital			1
@entity4 has been impressive for @entity14 this season , sometimes at centre half he is a calming influence on everyone around him , almost as if his team - mates can now relax and say : ‘ it ’s ok now , @entity4 is in the vicinity , we can just give it to him and we ’ll be ok , we ’ll keep possession			1
’ few players have the spatial awareness and ability to know where everyone is on the pitch , and how much space they ’re in			0
it seems to come naturally to @entity4			2
while @entity40 has every reason to curse his luck with injuries this season , he has been blessed with good fortune by the return of @entity4 , and the revelation that he is actually one of the best centre halves at the club			2
i ’m not sure the @entity51 was banking on that			0
i ’ve always been a massive fan but i thought his @entity6 chance had gone			0
and when i talk about his @entity6 chance , i mean @entity4 being a regular in the national side			1
he has been criminally overlooked , and in my view @entity6 now owe it to @entity4 to make him a regular , and in the immediate future , he can easily fill that troublesome second centre half role			1
some will only fancy him as one of three centre halves , but he ’s so good i do n’t see why he ca n’t be one of two			0
@entity14 manager @entity40 congratulates @entity4 after the win at @entity66 @entity4 has the ability to play in both defence and in midfield for both @entity14 and @entity6 and i think he will get the chance as well			1
this is what @entity6 coach and @entity4 ’s former team - mate @entity73 told me about @entity4 when i interviewed him recently : ‘ the players that play with him love him , and sir @entity78 picked him in probably 95 per cent of games during the most successful period of @entity14 ’s history			1
what he does is n’t wow , it ’s largely unseen stuff , but a lot of midfielders do n’t do it			0
’ at @entity14 he won five titles in his first seven years , played in three @entity89 finals and won one of them			0
yet his international career never took off			0
he made his @entity6 debut in may 2001 in a 4 - 0 friendly win over @entity94 at @entity96 ’s @entity95			1
but from that game , all the way through to the @entity98 in @entity99 in 2010 , @entity4 was never been an established regular in the @entity6 team			1
@entity4 has won 31 caps for @entity6 - but should have won far more @entity4 often found himself on the substitutes bench for @entity6 players such as @entity105 were often picked for @entity6 ahead of @entity4 between his debut and @entity6 ’s 4 - 1 thrashing at the hands of @entity109 in 2010 , @entity4 played 22 times for @entity6 , 16 of those in friendlies , and in only 10 of his games did he complete a full 90 minutes			1
the best moment @entity4 had in an @entity6 shirt was controlling the midfield in a man of the match display in @entity117 in november 2008			2
they beat @entity109 2 - 1 that night			0
it was @entity4 ’s first international for over a year			0
he won the @entity2 title and the @entity89 with @entity14 in 2007 - 08 ; also in that season he played just once for @entity6 , in a friendly			1
he was overlooked for crucial qualifiers in @entity123 and at home to @entity125 – @entity6 lost both and did n’t make it to @entity128			2
one of @entity4 's best performances for @entity6 came in the 2 - 1 friendly win over @entity109 in 2008 the most remarkable fact about @entity4 ’s international career is that he did n’t play a meaningful , competitive game for @entity6 from october 2006 through to september 2012			1
that ’s the period when he was helping @entity14 to domestic and @entity136 success			0
so while successive @entity6 managers struggled with the tricky @entity141 and @entity142 dilemma , @entity137 and @entity138 were golden boys for a while – even @entity105 played 21 times for @entity6 – the man trusted by @entity78 in @entity14 ’s central midfield was repeatedly overlooked			1
@entity4 has played a key role in helping @entity14 win five @entity2 titles in his time at @entity151 heads gone for the managers who ignored him , and in particular @entity153			1
a month after @entity4 ’s son was born , @entity153 took the midfielder to @entity99 for the @entity156			0
@entity6 were an embarrassing shambles , could n’t pass the ball to each other , yet @entity4 spent no time on the field at all			2
worse than that , @entity153 did n’t even take him to one side to explain why			0
so that ’s why this player deserves his @entity6 chance , along with the fact he ’s in brilliant form whether it ’s at centre half or central midfield			0
@entity4 is n’t a player who has let @entity6 down , the truth is the other way round			2

video 6 wins in a row , my wife is happy - @entity180			0

@entity4 has helped @entity14 win their last six games
@entity4 should be selected *alongside* @entity8 for @entity6
@entity4 has been overlooked too many times by his country
