they might look like two adults playing at being astronauts while doing their weekly shop , but in fact , the two men behind the masks have a deadly allergy to the sun. @entity9 and @entity10 , who live in @entity11 , @entity12 , suffer from @entity13 light			1
if they are , the twins are likely to develop a ' precocious ' and potentially fatal skin cancers			1
in some cases , just a glimpse of sunlight is all it takes for the cancer to develop			0
genetic : @entity9 and @entity10 ( pushing the trolley ) suffer from a condition called @entity13 , or @entity13 fatal : the genetic condition means their skin is very sensitive to sunlight , and even being exposed to a small amount can cause skin cancer advances : the twins have been testing new masks , designed to protect them from uv rays , for the last year in an effort to be allowed to live a normal life , the twins , who have been dubbed @entity38 by the @entity12 media , have be testing out a new protective mask			1
the mask is transparent and ventilated , and has been developed by several hospitals in @entity12			0
four years ago it was a different story			0
the boys had to wear a ski mask every time they left home , as well as coveralls and white gloves manufactured by @entity51			0
the boys , then 17 , knew it was a scary look : so much so , they allowed their lives to be the inspiration for @entity12 film @entity56			2
' i would love to stop scaring people , ' @entity10 said at the time it was released			1
' [ i hope it ] will allow people to take another look at the children suffering in @entity12			0
' normal : the boys have managed to live a relatively normal life , now attending the @entity68 precautions : @entity10 uses a device to check for ultra violet light before leaving the building in @entity11 danger : even lightbulbs can be dangerous for the twins - which means they have to keep the suits on while shopping image : @entity10 has previously said he would like people not to be scared of his appearance anymore @entity10 and @entity9 are two of just 70 or 80 people living with the genetic condition in @entity12			1
in the entire world , it is thought there are only somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 such cases			0
they were diagnosed with @entity13 aged just two and , within four months @entity10 had had three bouts of skin cancer			1
their worried parents @entity92 and @entity93 found ways of keeping their sons safe - including putting uv filters over the windows of their home			2
they also set up the charity @entity101 in 2000 , hoping to bring together people with the genetic conditions and put pressure on medical researchers to find out more about xp			0
rare : the twins - seen here in their apartment - are two of just 70 or 80 people who have the condition in @entity12 unusual : worldwide , it is thought only between five and 6,000 people suffer from xp education : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 talk to a student at the @entity68 however , it seems @entity10 and @entity9 managed to live a relatively ordinary life			1
growing up , they attended school , and went to the cinema and bowling with friends , and on weekends and during the holiday , they went swimming a skiing			0
they also developed one hobby which was particularly well - suited to their condition : caving			2
and nowadays they are students at the @entity68 - which made adjustments to the buildings to allow them to attend .			2

@entity10 and @entity134 , of @entity11 , have a rare genetic condition , @entity13
exposure to the sun can be fatal - so they have to keep covered up
for the last year , the twins have been *trialing* new protective masks
but the *university* students have managed to live relatively normal lives
