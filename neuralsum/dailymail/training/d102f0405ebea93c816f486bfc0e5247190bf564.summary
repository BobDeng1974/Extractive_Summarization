by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 13:54 est , 5 september 2013 thrill - seeking campers with a head for heights can now pitch their tents at the world 's most extreme ' campsite ' - 500ft up a sheer mountain face			1
daredevils pay an eye - watering Â£ 750 - the same price as a suite at @entity11 - to spend the night suspended in the air on a small platform halfway up a mountain			1
the accommodation comes in the form of a ' portaledge ' - an incredibly strong yet lightweight reinforced aluminum frame covered in canvas			1
ultimate thrill - seekers ' camping : suspended 500ft above the ground on a canvass and aluminium ledge , thsi new experience in @entity24 is only for the fearless the two - man platforms are hauled up the cliff face in the @entity24 @entity30 and secured to the rock using high strength climbing ropes and shackles			1
campers have to scale the mountain to get to their bed for the night - and can only bring with them the bare essentials of a sleeping bag , a rope and a basic dinner			1
fearless adventurers sleep alongside an instructor , who takes up the outside position just inches from the 500ft sheer drop			0
the two campers wear a safety harness to stop them falling should they roll off the portaledge in their sleep			2
guests pay premium prices to get the opportunity to watch the sun set and rise from such a perilous position effort : campers have to scale the mountain to get to their bed for the night - and can only bring with them the bare essentials of a sleeping bag , a rope and a basic dinner the extreme camping experience is the brainchild of staff at @entity65 , an outdoor activity centre in @entity67 , @entity68			1
included in the price is a day 's climbing tuition by the centre 's expert staff			0
the @entity65 also offers a tree - top package where campers can sleep on portaledges dangling from the branches of giant beech trees or wooden platforms suspended above the ground			1
@entity80 , a climbing expert and guide at @entity82 , said there are three types of camping experiences on offer at the @entity82			0
' with all of our camping you sleep in your harness for safety , ' he said			0
' t would be pretty hard to roll off the edge of the platforms but if you did , you would n't fall far			0
' the first experience is on wooden platforms that are suspended above the ground , and is for beginners			2
there is also the chance to opt for a less scary , tree hanging ledge when the weather is clear , the views are spectacular , although the ledges can swing rather a lot in the wind then there 's the ' exposed ' tree - top camping , he said , where guests can sleep on a portaledge dangling 20ft above the ground from the branch of a big beech tree in a forest overlooking mountains			1
' you can only get to the portaledge by climbing up a rope that hangs down from underneath it - so getting into bed is part of the challenge			2
' the sleeping platform is pretty exposed - if it 's windy , it will sway in the breeze , ' warned mr @entity80			2
but he said the final option , known as the @entity128 , is the ' most extreme , and only for the most hardcore thrill - seekers '			1
' as part of the ultimate experience you climb halfway up a mountain then pitch a portaledge right there on the face			2
do n't look down : these bizarre lodgings are not suitable for those with vertigo but with those with a head for heights , they get to see the beautiful @entity24 alps from a unique perspective ' you 're as high as 500ft and you 're completely exposed to all the elements - we call it " camping in the air "			0
' the beauty is you do n't have to be an experienced climber to take part , but you really do need a head for heights			0
' it is without a doubt the most extreme form of camping you could possibly do			0
' there 's no - one else in the world offering this kind of camping experience - we are unique			0
' it 's certainly not cheap but it is an once - in - a - lifetime experience you will never forget			0

thrill - seekers can spend a night on two - man platforms suspended on *stilts* , hanging from trees , or the ultimate accommodation - 500ft up a cliff face
on each ' portaledge ' in the @entity30 , guests are *attached* with a harness
they can only bring bare essentials - sleeping bag , rope and a basic dinner
