cabinet secretary sir @entity0 has ordered an official probe into claims that a civil servant leaked an official account of a private meeting between @entity6 and the @entity8 ambassador			1
the @entity10 leader has denied telling @entity8 ambassador @entity11 that she would prefer @entity12 to remain in @entity13 while suggesting that @entity14 was not prime minister material			1
ms @entity6 told supporters at a rally in @entity19 today that she had written to sir @entity0 to demand an official investigation			1
she then called on mr @entity14 to publicly commit to working with the @entity10 to ' lock out ' mr @entity12 from @entity28 in the event of a hung parliament			1
ms @entity6 described the account of her conversation with the @entity8 ambassador as ' 100 per cent untrue '			2
the memo was published in the @entity44 was written by a @entity46 civil servant following a conversation with consul - general @entity48 regarding the meeting between ms @entity6 and ambassador @entity11 , who was on her first visit to @entity52 in february			2
according to the memo : ' @entity53 appears to have focused mainly on the political situation , with the @entity55 stating that she would n't want a formal coalition with @entity58 ; that the @entity10 would almost certainly have a large number of seats ... that she 'd rather see @entity12 remain as @entity16			1
' the note went on to say that ms @entity6 had said she did not think @entity58 leader @entity14 was ' prime minister material '			1
the civil servant added : ' i have to admit that i 'm not sure that the @entity55 's tongue would be quite so loose on that kind of thing in a meeting like that , so it might well be a case of something being lost in translation '			0
mr @entity48 - who was at the meeting - told @entity74 that he had no recollection of ms @entity6 's alleged comments			2
he said : ' i do not know where this comes from , because it is certainly not in my report that anyone gave any preference			0
' @entity12 , pictured today , said any deal between @entity58 and the @entity10 would be a ' chaos alliance ' a spokesman for the ms @entity11 said : ' while the @entity88 and first minister , some time ago , discussed the political situation , ms @entity6 did not touch on her personal political preferences with regards to the future prime minister			1
' attending an anti-nuclear rally in @entity19 , ms @entity6 said : " this story has already been shown to be 100 per cent untrue - having been comprehensively rejected by both the @entity8 ambassador and consul general			2
' the real issue is how a second - hand and inaccurate account of this meeting - which was not even attended by the @entity103 - came to be written by a @entity103 civil servant and then leaked to @entity106 - supporting newspapers at the start of a general election campaign			2
' it suggests a @entity111 system out of control - a place where political dirty tricks are manufactured and leaked			0
and the @entity115 now appears to be denying the very existence of such a document			0
@entity6 would rather see @entity12 win the election because she does not see @entity14 as ‘ prime minister material ’ , it was reported last night			1
a memo shows that the @entity52 first minister told the @entity8 ambassador in february she would prefer to see mr @entity12 remain in @entity28			2
the document , which was leaked to the @entity44 , undermines the @entity10 leader ’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with @entity58 to keep the conservatives out of office			1
the @entity10 ’s opponents say the party would favour another @entity106 - led @entity26 government , against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-english sentiment and make an ‘ out ’ vote more likely in another referendum			1
written by a senior civil servant , the memo from february 26 states : ‘ the first minister confessed that she ’d rather see @entity12 remain as @entity16 ( and did n’t see @entity14 as @entity16 material )			1
’ she has denied the claims while last night last night the @entity8 consul general told the @entity144 that no such views were given by @entity146 , and ' absolutely no preference was expressed ' on the outcome of the general election			0
' i am therefore writing to the head of the @entity46 civil service , sir @entity0 , requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives			1
' the @entity10 leader added : ' anyone who knows anything about me knows i do n't want to see a @entity106 government			1
i 'm campaigning to get the @entity161 out of @entity28			0
we 've made if very clear that we will lock @entity12 out of @entity28 - the only person who 's not made that clear is @entity14			1
' we 've said that if there are more @entity10 and @entity165 than there are @entity106 mps , then we will vote to stop a @entity106 government even getting off the ground			2
i reissue my challenge to @entity14 today to say likewise			0
' conservative culture secretary @entity171 told @entity74 : ' who knows what the reality is there ? i think the one thing that we do know is that the @entity10 seem to be doing very well in @entity52 at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way @entity14 could every come into office is in coalition with the @entity10 and that would mean chaos for @entity46			1
' and a @entity106 spokesman said : ' @entity14 still wo n't rule out a deal with the @entity10 because he knows he ca n't get into @entity13 without them - he 's in the pocket of @entity186 and @entity6 has him on a leash			1
' and we know what 's in the ransom note : £ 148 billion more wasteful borrowing , higher taxes on ordinary families , weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay			0
' @entity198 leader @entity197 said : ' the first minister might deny reports of her tete - a - tete with the @entity8 but we all know a @entity106 - only government is the result of this election that the @entity10 want to see			2
a @entity106 pm governing alone in @entity28 and veering to the right fuels nationalist fires back home			0
' despite her fluffy , positive words about working with the rest of the @entity46 we know what she really thinks			0
her sole ambition is to break up the @entity46			0
' cabinet secretary sir @entity0 , pictured , has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal @entity14 , pictured , said he will not enter into any coalition with the @entity10 as he wants a majority mr @entity14 described the leaked memo as a ' damning revelation ' claiming the @entity10 were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public			1
he said : ' i 'm very clear that there wo n't be a coalition with the @entity10			0
that 's not going to happen , as for how other parties will end up voting on a @entity228 , that 's a matter for them			0
i want a majority @entity58 government			0
' mr @entity14 refused to rule out any post-election deal where he would rely on @entity10 support to prop up a minority government			2
he added : ' what i 'm saying very clearly is we are not going to have a coalition with the @entity10			0
as for other post-election possibilities , i 'm not getting into that			0
' prime minister @entity12 joined the row while campaigning in @entity242 today			0
he said : ' there is this coalition of chaos alliance we could end up with if we are not careful - an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt @entity46 - @entity58 - and the people who want to break up @entity46 - the @entity10 , @entity6 and @entity186			2
' that 's what we have got to avoid , that big danger of a coalition of chaos that would take our country back			0
' he claimed ms @entity6 's disputed opinion of the @entity258 ' told us something that i said about four years ago - that @entity14 is not up to the job of being prime minister			1
i think we knew that already ' .			0

@entity10 leader @entity6 dismissed claims she wants a @entity106 *victory*
she claimed the leaked memo is down to @entity26 's fear of the @entity10
she called on @entity14 to commit to a deal to ' lock out ' @entity12
