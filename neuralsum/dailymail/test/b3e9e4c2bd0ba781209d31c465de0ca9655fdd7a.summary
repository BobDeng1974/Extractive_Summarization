@entity0 thought scoliosis was the cause of her bad back @entity0 was assured by her gp that her nagging back pain was down to a mild curvature of the spine			1
she 'd gone to see him three months after suddenly developing back problems and had been referred for x-rays			1
these revealed that her spine was slightly curved , a condition known as scoliosis			1
' my gp said that as far as he was concerned , my pain was the result of the scoliosis and that i should try @entity21 to build up my muscle strength '			2
but @entity0 , 53 , felt there was more to it - she 'd always been strong and active until the pain began in the spring of 2013			1
as she explains : ' i 'd been doing a lot of gardening , and noticed my lower back ached afterwards , ' she says			2
' at first a hot bath would sort it out , but as the months passed i found the aching was bad after strenuous activity , such as @entity33 , and did n't go away after a bath any more			0
' painkillers were of little help			0
' if i made a sudden movement , i 'd experience a sharp , pinching pain in my lower spine that would take my breath away and force me to stop whatever i was doing			1
' a month after seeing her gp , and feeling increasingly desperate , @entity0 , an administrator , who is divorced with two grown - up children , and lives in @entity44 , @entity45 , used her private medical cover to see a spinal surgeon , @entity49			1
the consultant ordered an mri scan , which showed that she did have some scoliosis and her discs had signs of wear and tear , suggesting arthritis			1
but crucially the radiographer spotted that @entity0 's coccyx - the bone at the tail of the spine - was slightly enlarged			1
cases like @entity0 's are why some experts feel that too often back pain is written off as something that is to be endured , rather than investigated			1
' eighty per cent of people will experience an episode of severe back pain in their lifetime - but only 8 per cent of these go on to suffer chronic pain , ' says @entity75 , a neurosurgeon at @entity76 and the @entity77			1
' many of these chronic sufferers are simply dismissed as having ' non-specific low back pain '			1
' that term needs to be abandoned and early referral for investigation and diagnosis - based treatment should instead become the norm			0
' back pain is ' very often under - investigated ' , adds surgeon @entity49 , of the @entity87 in @entity44			1
' this means that treatable conditions such as disc prolapses , osteoporotic fractures , deformity , infection and tumours can be missed			0
' she sought a second opinion from a private surgeon , who sent her for an mri scan he adds : ' most back pain is the result of muscular strains , and is short - lived			1
' as long as there are no ' red flag ' symptoms - such as numbness around the groin and difficulties passing urine or with your bowels - then painkillers and physiotherapy are good approaches			0
' however , an mri should be offered when back pain goes on for eight weeks or more so that you know what you are dealing with and can treat this accordingly			1
' for instance , arthritis may be relieved with a simple painkilling spinal injection			2
if the pain is being caused by a nerve being compressed , treatment may involve surgery			2
around 1,000 people a year are diagnosed with tumours - benign or malignant - that start in the spine			0
in many cases , a growth on the spine will be a benign notochordal tumour			2
these are made of tissue left over from embyronic cells which help form a baby 's spinal cord			0
by the time a baby is born , these cells should have disappeared - if they remain , and nobody knows why this happens , they can develop into tumours			0
it 's estimated that 14 per cent of people have this kind of benign tumour on their spine and , in most , these are harmless			2
much more rarely , spinal tumours are malignant			0
sometimes these are secondary to cancer elsewhere in the body , particularly breast , brain or pancreatic cancer			0
cancer cells often go to the bones with the greatest blood supply , which includes the spine			0
these , too , can cause back pain			1
less commonly , the problem is a malignant tumour called a chordoma that originates in the spine			2
typically , they occur in adults between ages 40 and 70 , and often they are detected late - patients live on average just six years after diagnosis			0
a very observant radiologist spotted a tumour , which was removed @entity174 can occur anywhere along the spine , and the later symptoms such as back pain , numbness , aching and tingling can be mistaken for more minor strains or disc problems			1
as they get bigger , they may also cause changes in bowel and bladder function , and weakness of the arms and legs			0
in up to 40 per cent of patients they spread to the lungs , liver , bones , and skin			0
although it was apparent from her mri that @entity0 had a tumour , it was impossible to tell if it was cancerous or benign			1
the only options were to remove the entire coccyx , or leave the tumour and scan every few months to see if it grew			1
mr @entity49 recommended removing it			2
' the coccyx is n't a necessary part of our anatomy			0
in fact , it 's simply the remains of a tail from an earlier stage in our evolution , ' he says			0
@entity0 had her operation in october 2013			1
her coccyx was removed , complete with the 2cm tumour inside it			2
the tumour was sent for testing and was found to be malignant			0
however , it was surrounded by healthy tissue within the bone , which meant it had not spread			0
' i asked mr @entity49 to tell me the results over the phone , ' @entity0 recalls			1
' i did n't know what to feel as i was in the very strange position of not actually knowing i had cancer until i was cured			0
' following the surgery , sitting hurt so much that @entity0 was off work for six weeks			2
she now has a three - inch scar , and will need scans every year for five years - ' but after that we would consider her cured , ' says mr @entity49			2
' if the tumour was found later , the outcome could have been much bleaker			0
' ironically , after the operation , @entity0 still has back pain as a result of her arthritis			1
but she feels that dealing with the pain is nothing compared with what might have been			0
' i 'm so pleased i made a fuss instead of leaving things , ' she says			0

@entity0 , 53 , from @entity254 , @entity45 , had a nagging back pain
her gp assured her it as down to a mild curvature of the spine
but she 'd always been strong and active until the pain began in 2013
she used her private medical cover to see a spinal surgeon , @entity49
mri scan revealed her coccyx contained a tumour
