loneliness is often associated with elderly people who may have lost their partner or feel isolated because they 're less mobile			2
but a new report released today reveals that it is in fact younger people who feel more lonely than older generations - despite being more connected to their friends online			1
the survey , funded by the @entity10 , found that more than 80 per cent of young people feel lonely at some point			1
in comparison , 43 per cent of 18 to 34 - year - olds admitted they wished they had more friends			1
a third of the under 34 - year - olds said they found it hard to make new friends and they did n't know how to form new friendships			1
many admitted they were more likely to interact with friends online than face - to - face and that seeing what their friends were up to via social media sites like @entity16 increased their feelings of isolation			1
one young person who feels this way is @entity14 , 19 , from @entity38 , who appeared on today 's @entity15 to discuss the issue			2
she told presenters @entity40 and @entity42 that she often feels lonely thanks to websites like @entity16			2
she said : ' you look at all the things your friends are doing on social media where they have checked into a pub and tagged their friends or shared pictures of themselves out having fun and you 're sat at home not there			2
' during my a levels i spent lot time inside revising but you still see all these people having fun without you and it 's hard not to take that personally			0
' @entity42 , 54 , agreed that this contrasted with her experience growing up as ' when we were young , if you were n't invited to a party you did n't know about it			0
' @entity14 added that people often create an online persona that does n't reflect how they are really feeling and as a result , she often feels under pressure to do the same			1
she said : ' it makes you feel down all the time you are expected to be massive happy person like you are on social media , you start doubting the friends you have got			0
i have 1000 friends on @entity16 but i do n't have 1,000 friends in real life			0
' @entity14 said @entity16 often made her feel like she was left out of the fun her friends were having this @entity15 's agony aunt @entity79 advised people to be proactive if they are feeling lonely			1
she suggested they join more groups , take up a new hobby or organise an event like a coffee morning in order to meet more friends			0
she said : ' friendship like love does not climb in your window , if you do n't go out , you wo n't find it			0
' the @entity10 funded survey was carried out to promote ' the @entity94 ' , an idea from the @entity96 encouraging people across the @entity98 to have lunch with their neighbours on the first sunday in june in an act of community , friendship and fun			0
in 2014 , 4.83 million people took to their streets , gardens and community spaces for the sixth annual @entity10 lunch .			0
