' most importantly , if @entity3 had not gotten such permission , there would have been no @entity12			1
' permission : a collection of construction plans in @entity9 for @entity3 's @entity16 munitions factory @entity3 saved lives during @entity61 by employing @entity10 in munitions and other factories he owned			1
