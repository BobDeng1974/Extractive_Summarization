@entity1 cricket , once the envy of the world game , is facing oblivion after the @entity5 responded with fury to the cancelled tour that has again exposed the fragile nature of the sport ’s finances			1
the cricketing community was already reeling following last week ’s decision by the @entity1 players to call off their tour of @entity15 with a three - @entity17 series left unplayed because of a pay dispute with their own board			1
but on tuesday the @entity5 escalated the crisis , saying they would start legal proceedings against the @entity22 for a loss of income they claim to be as high as £ 40million , and suspending all series between the two countries			1
@entity28 stepped in at a moment ’s notice for a five - match one - day series , starting on november 2			1
@entity22 captain @entity34 , diving in the @entity36 in march , whose side left @entity15 early the @entity5 have announced they are claiming £ 40million in lost earnings it is the fate of @entity22 , however , that concerns most cricket - lovers			1
a successful claim by @entity15 would cripple @entity1 cricket for good			1
a year ago , their board was £ 3.5m in debt			0
this year ’s financial report by @entity47 suggests ‘ there is substantial doubt the company will be able to continue as a going concern ’			0
@entity15 ’s suspension of bilateral ties will cost the @entity1 game more than it can afford			1
@entity15 ’s previous full tour of the @entity56 , in 2011 , netted the hosts an estimated £ 14m in tv rights			2
but that money has gone and the potential loss of @entity15 ’s proposed visit in 2016 could bring @entity22 to their knees			2
as @entity65 , the respected @entity56 broadcaster , wrote : ‘ it should not have come to this			0
’ @entity22 all - rounder @entity66 will be part of the team heading home over the pay dispute in truth , the writing has been on the wall for some time			2
@entity22 ’ recent history is bedevilled by squabbles over pay , and the only surprise is that such drastic action , which has produced a sympathetic response from @entity81 legend @entity80 but opprobrium in other quarters , was not taken earlier			0
for those who recall @entity22 ’ 15 - year reign of terror , the latest development will bring only sadness			2
between 1979 - 80 , when they lost in @entity88 , and 1994 - 95 , when @entity89 became the first visiting side to win in the @entity56 for 22 years , @entity22 won 21 of their 29 @entity17 series and drew eight			1
@entity80 ( centre ) and the @entity22 dominated world cricket between 1979 and 1995 holding ( pictured ) sympathises with the situation in the @entity22 which threatens to derail @entity56 cricket no one could touch them ; everyone feared them			0
now , only @entity101 and @entity102 rank below @entity22 in both tests and one - day internationals			1
they have n’t won a single test against a major nation outside the @entity56 for almost seven years			0
it seems their administrators have mislaid their political nous , too			0
to fall out with @entity15 , whose finances effectively bankroll the smaller test nations , is tantamount to suicide			0
@entity15 cricketer @entity114 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity22 batsman @entity116 in 2013 tellingly , the @entity117 are pointing the finger at the @entity22 board rather than the players , many of whom are important members of the various @entity124 franchises			1
@entity124 chairman @entity125 has blamed ‘ the arrogance of the @entity22 ’ , adding : ‘ the players ca n’t be blamed			0
’ what happens next is anyone ’s guess			0
it is inconceivable that @entity22 will be allowed to send a second - string team to tour @entity133 later this year , nor to the @entity134 in @entity89 and @entity88 in early 2015			2
it should also be inconceivable that @entity1 cricket will disintegrate altogether , with disillusioned players set free to pursue @entity36 careers around the globe			1
and cricket would never be the same again			0
@entity142 representative @entity34 said his teammates were behind him in the decision to quit the tour of @entity15			0

@entity22 cancelled the nation *'s* tour of @entity15 this month
@entity28 have *hastily* agreed to play a one - day series in november
@entity5 claim £ 40million in lost earnings
they have started legal proceedings against bankrupt cricketing board
successful claim by @entity15 would cripple @entity1 cricket for good
