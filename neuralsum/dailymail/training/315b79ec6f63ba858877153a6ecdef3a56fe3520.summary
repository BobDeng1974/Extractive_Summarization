by @entity0 , @entity1 per @entity2 thinks @entity3 will lose the @entity5 final if they do not perform to the exact same standard as they did against @entity9			1
@entity3 pulled off one of the biggest shocks in the history of football when they hammered @entity9 7 - 1 in the semi-finals last week			1
the comprehensive nature of the win means @entity3 will go into sunday 's final against @entity18 as big favourites , but @entity2 has warned against the idea that @entity3 should already be regarded as world champions before the first whistle			1
' our performance against @entity9 was nearly 100 per cent			1
' if you look at the stats , the passing , the goals we scored , everything was so fluent			0
' but if we drop five per cent then we will have no chance			0
' going all the way : mertesacker and @entity43 celebrate make the final team - mates : @entity2 and @entity47 teammate @entity46 after the semi-final the streets of @entity3 were packed with jubilant fans who had stayed up to watch @entity52 's team rip the hosts apart with a ruthless attacking display on tuesday			1
mertesacker wants the memories of that night in @entity57 to be put to the back of his team - mates ' minds by sunday though			2
' ( winning 7 - 1 ) is dangerous for us , ' the @entity47 centre - back said			1
' we ca n't lose our focus now because we scored seven goals			2
' we must keep calm and be aware of the situation			0
our main target is to win the final			0
' we want to finish on a high			0
' we want more history			0
we do n't want to just settle for this result before the final			2

per @entity2 says @entity3 will lose if they let their standards slip
@entity47 defender says @entity3 must play @entity18 the way they did against @entity9
