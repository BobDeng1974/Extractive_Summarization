@entity8 , 6 , went to live with his father @entity9 in @entity10 nearly a year and a half ago after a court there ordered that his parents split custody in the country			1
but mother @entity16 was forced to stay behind in the @entity6 since she violated the @entity10 courts original order to bring the child to @entity10 and faced jail time for being in contempt of court			1

a court in @entity10 originally ruled that the two should split custody there miss @entity16 told the @entity37 she can not wait to get @entity8 ' back in my arms again ' after their year and a half apart			1
miss @entity16 , who lives in the @entity42 suburb of @entity43 , was told by @entity45 officials that the judge 's order would be ' immediately enforceable ' and that they are working to expedite a @entity6 passport for @entity8			2
she spoke to her son on wednesday , the day the decision was made public , but has n't told him about the good news yet			0
' i wanted to say something , but he 's only 6 , ' she said			0
' a few days feels like an eternity to him			0
' forced to stay behind : @entity16 was n't able to join her son in @entity10 , since she would have been arrested for being in contempt of court @entity8 was born in @entity30 , but moved with his parents to @entity10 when he was just 11 days old - making him a dual citizen and subject to @entity10 laws			1
though his parents never married , @entity9 filed for joint custody after their split			0
@entity8 boarded a flight form @entity66 to @entity10 on july 10 , after spending the day saying good bye to his mother - neither knowing when they were going to see each other again			2
