by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 3 april 2013 professor @entity1 has helped to halt plans for a three - storey extension to a riverside hotel in @entity5 after protesting it would ruin views of the university			1
the doubletree by @entity10 planned to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre on @entity13 and @entity13 by the river @entity15 in @entity5			1
but campaigners including the @entity19 author and comedian @entity17 argued that the new build would ruin the historic view of @entity22 , where they both studied			1
@entity24 planners agreed with the famous alumni , as well as more than 800 petitioners , and rejected the appeal by hotel owners @entity29 last month			1
campaigners including professor @entity1 ( left ) and comedian @entity17 ( right ) argued that the new build would ruin the historic view of @entity22 planning inspector @entity31 , from @entity24 , said the extension would detract ' from the pleasure to be had by lingering to appreciate the more panoramic views of the historic centre			1
' he added : ' protruding substantially into an area otherwise largely comprising green open space , it would stand out and appear intrusive			0
' @entity40 , chairman of the @entity41 , said she was ' absolutely delighted ' by the ruling			0
she said : ' the hotel 's extension would have blocked the view - effectively drawing a heavy curtain - between @entity13 and @entity13			2
' these two ancient fenlands are an integral part of the fingers of green which penetrate the city			0
' they are not parks but are uncultivated areas which bring the country - and the cows - right to the city 's centre			2
their openness must be preserved			0
' cllr @entity60 , who represents @entity61 on @entity24 , said : ' this is great news , not just for @entity61 but also for the city in general , as @entity13 and @entity13 form a unique green space close to the heart of the city			1
' @entity29 , which owns the @entity67 , applied for planning permission for a similar scheme in 2010 but it was rejected			0
the doubletree by @entity10 planned to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre on an area of @entity13 and @entity13 by the @entity15 in @entity5 planning officers said the expansion would have an adverse impact on nearby conservation areas			1
the second project was designed to sit further back from the @entity15 and be clad in brick and includes tree planting			2
but the application was refused by @entity82 last year and the appeal by @entity29 was rejected on march 22			0
@entity29 argued in the appeal that the leisure centre currently on the plot had ' little architectural merit			1
' it said the extension would ' respond positively to the historic surroundings ' and would unlock ' significant economic investment			0
' but campaigners said the group 's plans for the hotel did not include adequate provision for increased traffic			0
the no campaign described the design as ' fussy and lacking coherence ' and said the extension was ' unacceptable by virtue of its height , scale , mass and bulk , the material of its construction and its position on the site '			2
the @entity110 declined to comment .			0

@entity10 planned to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre
it *wanted* to build on @entity13 and @entity13 by the @entity15
but @entity1 and comedian @entity17 *joined* campaign against it
now @entity24 has rejected plans for the extension
