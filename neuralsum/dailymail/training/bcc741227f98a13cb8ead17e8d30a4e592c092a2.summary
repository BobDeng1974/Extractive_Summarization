broken @entity0 : prime minister @entity1 said during a visit to a @entity4 school yesterday that he was determined to bring ' rigour ' back to the classroom @entity1 yesterday launched a blitz on ‘ coasting ’ schools in affluent areas which are being outshone by their inner - city counterparts			1
he said hundreds of secondary schools in better - off parts of the country needed a ‘ wake - up call ’ to improve their results			2
in a major speech , mr @entity1 said that schools in areas such as @entity20 and @entity21 were being out - performed by two inner - city @entity23 schools			1
the prime minister said these coasting schools could not blame deprivation for their poor results and pledged to expose their ‘ complacency ’			2
speaking at a newly - opened free school in @entity4 , mr @entity1 also warned that parents of youngsters who play truant face having their benefits cuts			1
he pledged to bring ‘ rigour ’ back into @entity0 ’s classrooms and condemned @entity39 ’s ‘ prizes for all ’ culture , which frowns on competitiveness			2
mr @entity1 is under increasing pressure to reassure @entity43 mps and voters that the @entity45 is in touch with middle - class anxieties			1
his speech was seen as a deliberate contrast to pledges by deputy prime minister @entity51 to drive up standards in poorer areas			0
promising a ‘ revolution ’ in choice , competition and freedom for schools , mr @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s not just failing schools we need to tackle			1
respect : as well as giving teachers ' more powers to deal with unruly pupils , ' restoring discipline is also about what parents do ' , mr @entity1 said it ’s coasting schools , too – the ones whose results have either flat - lined or where they have n’t improved as much as they could have			1
’ he said four - fifths of schools in @entity20 and @entity21 had produced poorer results than @entity80 and @entity81 , both of which are in @entity23			2
between 70 to 75 per cent of pupils at the @entity23 schools gained five or more good gcses , despite large numbers being eligible for free school meals – the accepted measure of relative poverty			1
mr @entity1 went on : ‘ that must be a wake - up call			1
why is there this difference ? why are these schools coasting along ? ’ free schools : @entity23 mayor @entity97 ( centre right ) and @entity99 ( centre left ) with headmaster @entity101 ( top centre ) and the first students of the newly opened @entity104 twenty - four new free schools have been set up in @entity108 since the @entity45 came to power - more than half open this week , the rest by the end of the @entity112 policy , a central plank of the @entity43 ' election manifesto , gives people the chance to set up schools in direct response to local @entity118 schools can be primary or secondaries and can be set up by a wide range of proposers which have included teachers , parents , charities , universities , businesses and faith groups			1
many are being set up because there are simply not enough school places in the area.the schools , like the new academies , are funded directly by @entity133 , are semi-independent and outside local authority control			2
they have the freedom to vary term times , the curriculum and teachers ' pay and @entity140 schools can not make a profit and will be subject to the same @entity144 inspections as state schools			1
they will also have to take part in their local admissions process			0
senior @entity151 sources said ‘ super heads ’ with experience of turning schools around could be drafted in to work alongside existing head teachers to improve standards			2
one source said that parents will be able to judge whether their school is ‘ coasting ’ when more detailed performance figures are published in january next year			2
the government recently announced it was increasing the minimum standard for schools			0
by 2015 any secondary school in which fewer than 50 per cent of pupils get five good gcses will be defined as failing			0
the standard is currently 30 per cent			0
ministers hope a further 200 free schools will open next year , and also say around 150 failing secondaries and 200 failing primary schools will have been transformed into academies by that time			1
mr @entity1 said more discipline was needed to mend a ‘ broken society ’			1
@entity175 , of @entity176 , the largest teachers ’ union , said : ‘ the prime minister ’s speech is a desperate attempt to detract attention from the fact that his @entity184 is engaged in a deliberate attempt to privatise schools			0
’ n mr @entity1 wants his old school , @entity189 , to set up a free school , it emerged yesterday			1
he has held meetings in @entity151 with the heads of top public schools – including the exclusive £ 30,000 - a - year boarding school			0
it is considering setting up a free ‘ mini @entity189 ’ , with boarding facilities and high academic standards – but without the price tag			0
prime minister @entity1 ( centre back row ) at @entity202 prep school in 1976 @entity1 is perfectly placed to discuss elitism in @entity0 society having benefited from attendance at the cream of the independent @entity108 education system			1
as a young boy he attended the preparatory school , @entity202 , in @entity210 , favoured by @entity211 and boasting @entity212 and @entity213 as former pupils			0
it was from their exclusive classrooms that he made the move to the world ’s best known public school for boys , @entity189 , where annual fees at the six hundred - year - old boys ’ school are £ 31,000			0
at current rates the prime minister ’s senior school years would have cost more than £ 150k and that does not include expenditure on school clubs , like boating and fencing which carry additional tariffs			0
the prime minister - in - waiting then moved to study @entity234 at @entity235 becoming a member of the select all - boy dining society , the @entity238			0
his elevated position in society is apparent in every aspect of his life and has seen him marry well			0
his wife @entity243 is the daughter of sir @entity244 and her mother is @entity246 , @entity247 and ceo of furniture chain @entity249 .			0

@entity1 demands *urgent* classroom *reforms* to help mend our ' broken society '
parents of unruly children could face benefits cuts
he *rejects* ' prizes for all ' society and backs new free schools
national curriculum review to focus on subjects like *algebra*
