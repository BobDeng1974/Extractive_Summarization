a disc - shaped stone has to be tossed at an angle of 20 degrees to achieve the maximum number of bounces across water			1
inspired by @entity8 scientist @entity7 , who invented the bouncing bomb , researchers have described the complicated physics behind the water - skipping behaviour in stones , toys and even cannonballs			1
@entity16 gunners as far back as the 18th century bounced cannonballs as a military tactic - removing the launch angle as a variable in sinking enemy ships			1
for heavier objects , though , this angle needs to be lessened professor @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity27 , and his colleagues said : ' @entity7 recaptured the variable - reducing military advantage during @entity41 with his bouncing bomb			1
' designed to breach @entity45 dams , the weapon skipped over the water surface to avoid undersea torpedo nets			2
' writing on the blog @entity51 , @entity49 architect @entity48 explained there are three different types of fort - tunnel forts , buttress forts and compound forts			0
he believes that many children manage to trap themselves inside forts and should instead build the exterior first			0
' kids , left to their own devices , pile up pillows and then figure out how to get inside , ' he said			0
' or , they ’ll build it around themselves and then they ca n’t leave without destroying it			0
' mr @entity48 , who in his day job works for @entity67 , urged children to think like an architect			0
he warned prospective builders should first sort the available pillows based on which ones are best for walls and which ones are a good for laying on inside the finished fort			0
writing in @entity77 , they say water skipping has returned to more docile roots of late with toy balls that make it much easier to achieve multiple hops			1
the researchers said : ' those spheres are made of an elastic material whose high compliance - or ability to readily deform - introduces some interesting changes to the skipping phenomenon			2
' but , with a side throw and flick of the wrist , people young and old have been skipping stones across water for thousands of years with the object of getting as many bounces as possible			1
the world record , according to the @entity99 , is 88 skips set this year by an @entity102 called @entity103			0
professor @entity37 said the skill depends on what angle the thrower chooses to hurl an object at , with the optimal for disc - shaped stones close to 20 °			1
but the heavier the object , the flatter this should be			1
he said : ' spheres are generally harder to skip than discs			0
in fact , previous research suggests an upper bound on the initial course angle 18 °			0
' thus for steel cannonballs , skipping can only occur for angles shallower than seven degrees			2
' @entity16 gunners as far back as the 18th century bounced cannonballs as a military tactic ( stock image shown ) - removing the launch angle as a variable in sinking enemy ships			1
to get the best bounce on the surface of the water in this instance , @entity128 said the angle should be less than seven degrees the world record for skimming stones , according to the @entity99 , is 88 skips set this year by an @entity102 called @entity103			1
professor @entity37 said the skill depends on what angle the thrower chooses to hurl an object at ( stock image shown ) an alternative method involves imparting a great deal of backspin to a rounded stone so it dives under the surface and then pops up and out of the water			2
@entity128 said : ' the technique does not yield many skips but it 's impressive nonetheless			0
' to pull it off you need to throw the stone at the water surface at a much higher course angle than for the usual disc skipping			2

a @entity27 researcher has *investigated* how objects skip on water
he found that the optimal angle to skim stones was 20 degrees
however the heavier the object was , the flatter this angle needed to be
water skipping is a popular past time with stones and toys
but it is also a useful military tactic , used by bouncing bombs and cannons
