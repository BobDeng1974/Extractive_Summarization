@entity0 has remained a controversial voice in the aftermath of a grand jury deciding not to indict @entity4 in the shooting death of @entity6 , but on monday the anchor went so far he even manged to alienate a fellow @entity9 contributor			1
remarking on a group of @entity12 players who adopted a ' hands up , do n’t shoot ' stance in a show of solidarity for @entity18 protesters prior to sunday 's game , @entity0 said on @entity20 ; ' quite frankly , i do n’t think they ’re smart enough to know what they ’re doing			1
' he then added again , ' i absolutely do n’t think they ’re smart enough to know what they ’re doing			0
not agreeing at all with this statement however was @entity44 , a regular @entity9 contributor , who seemed disgusted with what @entity0 had to say			1
@entity44 said she thought that the players ' non-violent ' protest was fine , and then later defended her comments on @entity51 , saying , ' @entity52 is @entity53 if @entity55 players make displays w / which i disagree			1
not being as upset as you does n’t mean i betrayed @entity60			0
' @entity9 analyst @entity61 , also a guest on monday , disagreed with @entity0 as well , and his take away that the football players were somehow coming out against all police			1
' look , you ’ve got crazy people on all sides , @entity0 , ' said @entity61			2
' but if you think that those football players identify and say , " oh , all cops are bad " ? that is not true			0
' other side : @entity0 's guests on monday , @entity73 @entity44 ( left ) and analyst @entity61 ( right ) did not agree with his statements on sunday , @entity12 players @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 took to the field making the same gesture many protesters have been making across the country these past two weeks			1
this as crowds gathered outside the stadium during the game chanting ' hands up , do n't shoot ! ' it seems that even @entity9 may have had a problem with @entity0 's statement , as they took down the clip after posting it earlier in the day on tuesday			1
@entity0 has been very vocal about his disdain for @entity18 protesters , saying that even those who did not loot or set buildings on fire should still be considered criminals for continuing to protest as these events happened			0
meanwhile , the @entity12 @entity101 has called on both the @entity55 and the @entity12 to discipline the five players			1
they called the moved ' tasteless , offensive and inflammatory			0
' the @entity55 and the @entity12 said monday that the players would not be punished			2
unrest : a protester is dragged away outside the @entity12 home game on sunday @entity78 spoke about the gesture following the game , saying ; ' there has to be a change that starts with the people that are most influential around the world			2
' he then added , ' no matter what happened on that day , no matter how the whole situation went down , there has to be a change			0
' @entity12 county police chief @entity121 has claimed that @entity12 ' chief operating officer called him to apologize about the incident , something he vehemently denies			2
' we did not apologize , ' @entity12 spokesman @entity125 told @entity127			0
the @entity101 then responded to that claim by posting on their @entity130 page ; ' even though mr. @entity132 stated he never apologized , the chief believed it to be an apology and the chief sent the email to police staff to let them know about the call , after he told mr. @entity132 he would share his sentiments with his staff			0

@entity0 commented on five @entity12 players who adopted a ' hands up , do n't shoot ' pose before game sunday
he said that he the players were n't ' smart enough to know what they *'re* doing ' and that they were propagating a lie
his guests , @entity9 contributors @entity44 and @entity61 disagreed with his statement
@entity61 then disagreed with @entity0 's *assessment* that this was implying the players were against all police
this as the @entity12 and the @entity55 *refuse* to apologize to the @entity12 @entity160 for what they call a ' tasteless , offensive ' move
