by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 08:51 est , 19 march 2014 women who use surrogate mothers to have a child do not have a legal right to maternity leave when the baby is born , the @entity2 ruled on tuesday			1
the 1992 law governing who does get maternity leave states that it must be granted to a woman ‘ who has been pregnant and who has given birth to a child , ’ it noted			1
this means that under @entity21 law even if the birth mother gives the baby away , she still retains the right to maternity leave			1
the @entity21 's highest court said @entity21 ‘ law does not establish a right to paid leave equal to maternity leave or adoption leave ’ for women having a child by a surrogate			2
ruling : the @entity2 has denied two women who became parents through a surrogate mother the right to maternity leave ( file picture ) at present a @entity38 employer does not have to give paid maternity leave to someone who has a baby through a surrogate arrangement and the @entity21 ruling backed this up			1
the @entity2 stated that there is no law governing this aspect of maternity leave - but left the door open for member states to address this loophole			1
the @entity38 government is doing just that by modifying the @entity54			0
as @entity56 , head of employment at law firm @entity55 , said , ' surrogacy arrangements are already on the cards ' , with intended parents in surrogacy arrangements becoming entitled to flexible parental leave and pay when reforms come in in spring 2015			0
she added that ' the rights to adoption leave and pay mirror those of maternity leave and pay '			2
however , from next april , @entity38 mothers who have children through surrogacy will be able to claim broadly equivalent maternity leave , despite the @entity2 's ruling			1
the ruling highlights a loophole in maternity laws that @entity21 countries are free to address			0
the @entity2 said that member states are ' free to apply more favourable rules for the benefit of commissioning mothers ' - and the @entity38 's @entity54 is being modified from april 2015 so that those who ' commission ' a birth have the same maternity rights as the birth mother			1
@entity87 , legal director of employment at @entity89 , told @entity90 that @entity38 laws can differ from @entity21 laws , as long as they meet the minimum standard set out by @entity95 judges			0
she said : ‘ the @entity38 government implements @entity95 laws with its own @entity38 legislation , which should be no less favourable than an individual ’s @entity95 employment rights			0
the @entity38 often “ gold - plates ” @entity95 employment rights by going beyond the @entity95 minimum requirements			0
in such cases an individual would rely on their more generous @entity38 rights and seek enforcement of such rights within @entity38 courts			0
‘ the @entity38 government , within the @entity109 from april 2015 , is trying to address loopholes such as the rights of parents in surrogacy arrangements , as well as making changes to the law to recognise modern day family relationships for example the introduction of shared parental leave			2
’ the @entity2 was considering two cases : one of a @entity38 woman who worked for an @entity123 , ms @entity124 , who could not get pregnant and had a child , fathered by her husband but carried by another woman and using another woman 's egg			2
flexible : from next april , @entity38 mothers who have children through surrogacy will be able to claim maternity leave the husband and wife were subsequently given full parental rights over the child with the consent of the surrogate mother			1
she initially took her case to a tribunal in @entity144 , claiming discrimination under the @entity146 , but that ruled in 2011 that the birth mother has the right to maternity leave , not her			1
in the second case , a teacher in @entity152 , ms z , who was fertile but had no uterus , used a surrogate mother in @entity158			0
she and her husband were the child 's full biological parents and recognised as such under @entity162 law			0
in both cases , however , when the women asked for maternity leave so as to look after their babies , their employers turned them down on the grounds that neither had gone through a pregnancy or adopted their children			2
reviewing the cases against @entity21 legislation on conditions for working mothers , fair treatment and physical handicap , the court said it could find no grounds to say that such a refusal of maternity leave breached @entity21 law			2
@entity182 , an employment partner at @entity184 , told @entity185 : ‘ the @entity2 's narrow interpretation that only birth mothers get maternity leave goes counter to the prevailing trend in the @entity38 , which is to recognise the importance of intended mothers , whether through surrogacy or adoption , to have time off from work in order to allow them to bond with their new baby or child			1
' @entity200 , an employment lawyer at @entity201 , said that advances in medical technology mean surrogacy is more common than ever , but that the law has n’t moved with the times			0
the rights to adoption leave mirror those of maternity leave .			0

@entity2 says maternity leave must go to birth mother
this is the case even if the birth mother subsequently gives the baby away
from next april @entity38 surrogate mothers will be able to claim maternity leave
