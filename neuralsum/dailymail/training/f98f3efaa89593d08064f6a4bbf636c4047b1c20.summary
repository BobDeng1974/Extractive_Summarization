by @entity0 published : 14:18 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 07:41 est , 10 december 2012 an army of sinister hoodies appear to have invaded @entity3			0
but closer inspection reveals that the strange figures are in fact mannequins styled in bizarre positions			2
confused passers by in the city have spotted the models placed in a giant dart board like human darts , left in a dumpster with only their legs showing and even playing tug of war on a rooftop as they appear to be breaking in			1
heave ho : passers by have been stunned to see the hooded figures in various different places around the city			2
here they appear to be playing tug of war on a rooftop wasted : the artist has become known for his macabre sense of fun in his work , such as this ' legs in a dumpster piece ' chilling : a hooded mannequin runs the risk of getting a ticket as he catches up on some sleep between two parking signs the offbeat art installation was the brainchild of @entity37 street artist @entity36 , 42 from @entity38 @entity36 , who worked as a saxophonist and web designer before switching to street art , said his aim is to get people to look up from their mobile phones for a split second and engage with the world around them			1
he said : ' most of the work focuses on hyper realistic situations that interact with the environment			0
' ' but there is usually a surrealistic aspect that sends my work into the land of the absurd			0
' stunned : a male mannequin appears to be captivated by the beauty of an expensively dressed shop model oh , you should n't have ! : an eerie hand juts out of a wall offering a bunch of flowers to passers by , while mannequins appear to have been fired at a giant darts board fishing on a star : a fisherman dangles his rod over the side of a building as another hangs out on the street			1
@entity36 said he wants people to look up from their mobile phones for a split second and ' engage with the world around them ' ' for example we see a mannequin headed man on the knees worshipping an expensively dressed woman mannequin			1
' and people so covered in litter that they are like bugs , which i call litterbugs			0
' all of this is ultimately about the absurd - by challenging the idea of normal behaviour i get people to think differently about the city			0
hanging out : a man walks between arches as one of @entity36 ' sculptures hangs out above the cheeky artist positions slices of toast to poke out of a drain close to a pavement			1
art fans say @entity36 has become the first celebrity 3d street artist are you in there ? : a mannequin lies covered in newspaper in a backstreet			1
@entity36 has said his work causes ' fear which then turns to laughter ' litter bugs : the mannequins appear to have become a magnet for rubbish as they stand next to a bin on a street in @entity3 ' the reaction of passers - by is usually fear or confusion that turns to laughter			1
' @entity36 ' first street project was a series of clear tape casts made from his body that he installed on the streets in @entity127 , in 2003			2
in 2005 he began working with @entity128 on the @entity129 , a series where tape ' babies ' are ' dropped ' in different cities he told the @entity134 : ' people are generally curious			0
kids , adults , and a police officer have approached with the question “ what is that ? ” then that ’s usually followed by “ how many rolls of tape did it take ? ” ' what i ’m doing is similar to the way writers and filmmakers create a fictitious reality			0
my work is n’t in a theater or a book , though - it comes at you out of nowhere one day when you ’re walking down the street			0

@entity37 artist @entity36 has created the street installations to ' get people to look up from their mobile phones '
he has placed hooded mannequins poking out of bins , playing tug of war , and apparently fired at a darts board
