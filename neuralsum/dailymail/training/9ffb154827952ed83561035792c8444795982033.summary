by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:53 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 14:55 est , 13 may 2013 @entity2 is to double its support for @entity5 opposition forces , as @entity6 left the door open to providing arms in the coming weeks , the prime minister said ending the bloody conflict was the most pressing global challenge , and pledged to step up the non-lethal equipment being shipped to forces trying to overthrow president @entity14			1
he warned that without providing more than ‘ technical advice ’ to moderate @entity5 rebels , there was a risk that extremists groups would take hold			1
he said the @entity2 would continue to press for changes to the @entity44 arms embargo and added : ‘ we will double non-lethal support to the @entity5 opposition in the coming year			1
armoured vehicles , body armour and power generators are about to be shipped			0
’ an extra £ 10 million for non-lethal military aid would be made available for @entity5 rebels and £ 30 million more would be ploughed into humanitarian assistance , under the plan outlined today			1
mr @entity6 said @entity14 had to realise there could be no military victory for his forces			0
‘ there will be no political progress unless the opposition is able to withstand the onslaught and put pressure on @entity14 so he knows there is no military victory , ’ mr @entity6 said			0
last week he held talks with @entity67 president @entity66 , who remains opposed to the overthrow of @entity14			2
mr @entity6 said 80,000 people were dead and five million had been forced from their homes as a result of the ‘ brutal conflict ’ in @entity5			1
he added : ‘ @entity5 's history is being written in the blood of her people and it is happening on our watch			1
the world urgently needs to come together to bring the killing to an end			0
‘ none of us have any interest in seeing more lives lost , in seeing chemical weapons used , or extremist violence spreading even further			0
’ the @entity2 would increase efforts to ‘ support and to shape the moderate opposition ’			2
mr @entity6 last week met @entity67 president @entity89 but the two men failed to reached agreement on the need to remove @entity14 from power in @entity5 president @entity89 still refuses to join the international community in taking stronger actions against president @entity14 's regime mr @entity6 also promised more humanitarian assistance for those affected by the violence			1
‘ there is now common ground between the @entity31 , @entity2 , @entity67 and many others that whatever our differences , we have the same aim : a stable , inclusive and peaceful @entity5 free from the scourge of extremism			1
‘ there 's real political will behind this			0
we now need to get on and do everything we can to make it happen			0
’ mr @entity6 insisted no decision had been made on arming opposition groups in @entity5			2
‘ what we have done is we have amended the @entity44 arms embargo in order that we can give technical assistance and technical advice , and as i said in my statement , that is exactly what we are doing			0
‘ we are continuing to examine and look at the @entity44 arms embargo and see whether we need to make further changes to it in order to facilitate our work with the opposition			0
‘ i do believe that there is more we can do alongside technical advice , assistance , help , in order to shape them , in order to work with them			0
’ regional tensions have escalated since the twin car bomb attacks in the town of @entity140 near the @entity142 - @entity5 border this week the @entity2 government has drawn up options which including lifting the embargo against giving arms to opponents of the @entity14 regime and he challenged critics of his intervention to realise that the consequences of failing to act could be much worse			1
‘ if we do n't help the @entity5 opposition - who we do recognise as being legitimate , who have signed up to a statement about the future for @entity5 that is democratic , that respects the rights of minorities - if we do n't work with that part of the opposition , then we should n't be surprised if the extremist elements grow			2
‘ so i think being engaged with the @entity5 opposition is the right approach and that is an approach i know i share with the president and other colleagues in the @entity44			2

prime minister promises more help to rebels to overthrow @entity5 regime
@entity2 to send extra £ *10million* in non-lethal equipment and £ *30million* in aid
