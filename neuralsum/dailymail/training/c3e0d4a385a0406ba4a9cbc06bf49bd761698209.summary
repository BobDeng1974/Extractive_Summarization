spreading : the gruesome attack on the alleged sorcerer was carried out close to the time when a 20 - year - old woman was tortured and burned to death after she was accused of using witchcraft to kill a six - year - old boy in the latest gruesome incident , a 50 - year - old man named as @entity34 , from the village of @entity36 , in the eastern part of the country , was attacked at his home by a group of people convinced he had used witchcraft to bring about the slow death of another villager			1
they hacked him to pieces with machetes , said provincial police commander @entity49 , and then set his body parts on fire when they applied torches to his hut			1
‘ he ’d argued with other villagers during the day when they accused him of using sorcery to kill another person , ’ said @entity54			0
still alive : sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in @entity5 's highlands sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in @entity5 and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation			1
the cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 new @entity5 kina ( £ 303 ) , plus a pig and a bag of rice , in 1971 , whilst still a colony , the country introduced a @entity77 to criminalise the practice			1

’ sorcery is rife through the remote regions of jungle - clad @entity5 , where alleged witches and witch doctors are said to use effigies of their victims and so - called magic chants to bring about the deaths of their enemies and their relatives			1
