the @entity1 desert is normally associated with enormous casinos and lavish hotels			0
but it could soon become a focal point of the motoring industry - as @entity8 's $ 5billion @entity7 takes shape			2

in september , the @entity18 born entrepreneur announced that the site near @entity20 , @entity1 , was the chosen location for the lithium - ion battery plant , which is expected to reduce the price of the @entity24 by $ 2,800			1
growing : @entity8 's $ 5billion @entity7 - which will be able to produce 500,000 lithium - ion batteries every year - takes shape in the desert near @entity20 , @entity1			1

since then the building has grown and looks set to be ready by the time partial production begins in 2017			1
the aim is to produce enough batteries to power 500,000 vehicles a year when it is fully completed in 2020 and produce a power source that can also be installed in gadgets such as toys and drones			1
production is currently based in @entity55 , @entity56 , but the plant does not have the capacity to serve the company 's future production needs			2
the facility is expected to bring 6,500 jobs to @entity1 and $ 100 billion in economic benefits , according to @entity64			2
in return , the state offered @entity8 up to $ 1.3 billion in tax breaks			0

that 's led by an estimated 328,000 - person bump in @entity110 and an estimated 147,000 - person gain in @entity112			0
but northern @entity1 , where the gigafactory will be built , is expected to feel the most direct impact from @entity8			0
location : an image taken from the hills surrounding the complex reveal its isolation and scale development : construction has moved along at a rapid rate since november ( pictured )			0
the project is set to last for another five years but partial production is set to begin in 2017 future : an artist 's impression shows what the site could look like when it is finished in 2020			1
@entity1 will also benefit from an investment in roads leading to the facility and potential to surround it with other ventures entrepreneur : the huge project is part of co-founder and ceo @entity13 's plans to drive down the cost of electric car			1
