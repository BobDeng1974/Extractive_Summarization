created : 20:05 est , 1 december 2013 researchers suggest migraine sufferers should limit their risk of exposure to @entity4 by cutting out the use of plastic microwave trays and refillable bottles drinking water from water coolers or refillable bottles could be giving millions of @entity12 headaches			1
new research shows that a controversial ‘ gender - bending ’ chemical in synthetic packaging may trigger migraines			0
@entity4 ( @entity4 ) has already been linked to a range of heath problems including obesity , infertility and heart attacks			1
now the latest study – published in the journal @entity24 – points to @entity4 causing the debilitating headaches which afflict one in seven @entity12 adults			1
the authors urge sufferers to strip out potential sources of contamination from their daily diet , which include plastic microwave trays , refillable bottles and office water coolers			1
their report states : ' a previously performed study using a " fresh foods " dietary intervention demonstrated a significant decrease in urinary @entity4 ( 66 per cent reduction ) in patients after just three days			1
' these findings combined with our results suggest that a clinical trial to decrease bpa exposure and levels in migraine sufferers ... may reduce headache frequency and / or severity , revealing strategies that may increase the quality of life of migraineurs			2
' the @entity56 study emulated human exposure to @entity4 in the laboratory			1
researchers observed the behaviour of rats , half of whom were administered the chemical once every three days			0
within half an hour of the dose , those exposed to @entity4 became less active , steered clear of loud noise and strong light , were easily startled and showed signs of tenderness to the head			0
the rats ’ brains also gave off telltale signals of an influx of oestrogen			0
migraines have been linked to sudden changes in levels of the female sex hormone , which @entity4 mimics			1
the report states : ' the behavioural measures used [ were ] designed to model many of the symptoms humans experience during a migraine attack			0
' rats exposed to @entity4 demonstrated significantly augmented migraine - like behaviours			0
' these results imply that @entity4 has the ability to amplify symptoms that are used to diagnose the disorder in human patients , suggesting that exposure to @entity4 would increase both the incidence and prevalence of this disorder			2
' around five million @entity12 suffer from migraines though women are three times more likely to have them			2
neurologist dr @entity102 , of the @entity104 charity , said : ' we know @entity4 is used in materials such as food packaging , plastics and tins			0
' in most sufferers , attacks are genetically linked and the triggers only generate them in those who are predisposed			2
' but if @entity4 is implicated in the genesis of migraines than this would certainly be a milestone in headache research			2
' @entity4 is so commonplace because of the range of products it ’s found in , everything from car dashboards to shower curtains to till receipts and cosmetics			0
countries across the world – including @entity129 member states , @entity130 and @entity131 - have moved to ban the chemical from baby bottles			0
the previous study which tested a ‘ fresh foods ’ diet picked families from @entity138 who ate canned food and were exposed to @entity4 through at least two of four other sources : drinking from refillable water bottles ; drinking from office water coolers ; eating meals away from home and eating eating meals microwaved in plastic .			1
