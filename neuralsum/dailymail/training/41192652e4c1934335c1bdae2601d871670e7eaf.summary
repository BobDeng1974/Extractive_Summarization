standing down : sir @entity0 announced today that he is retiring at the end of the year @entity3 ’s most powerful civil servant will retire at the end of the year with a £ 2.3million pension pot. sir @entity6 ’s £ 240,000 - a - year job is to be split into three to try to curb the influence of the post of cabinet secretary			1
as well as being head of the @entity12 and in charge of the @entity14 , the 59 - year - old has worked closely with four prime ministers and organised last year ’s @entity17 negotiations			1
the fact that sir @entity0 , who is likely to join the @entity20 , has been allowed early retirement at a time when public sector staff are being told to work longer before drawing their pensions enraged unions yesterday			1
@entity27 , of the @entity28 , said : ‘ at a time of record public sector job cuts , civil servants who are suffering a pay freeze and facing a raid on their pensions will be angered by what appears to amount to a job - creation scheme for the @entity12 elite			2
‘ while @entity6 heads for the @entity20 , pocketing a pension worth around 30 times more than the average for his staff , the future looks decidedly more bleak for the ranks of public servants who provide essential services day in , day out			2
’ @entity47 , a former @entity48 minister , said : ‘ it looks like one law for those at the top and another for those at the bottom			2
’ sir @entity0 ’s £ 2.3million pension pot after 36 years of service is the equivalent to an annual payment of £ 105,000 and a lump sum of £ 315,000			2
advice : sir @entity0 with @entity61 and @entity62 , his fourth prime minister @entity62 announced @entity64 , currently permanent secretary at @entity65 , will become cabinet secretary and provide advice to him and @entity68			1
another mandarin will be made head of the @entity12 , responsible for providing professional and corporate leadership to civil servants			0
new role : @entity64 will replace @entity0 , combining his job with his role as permanent secretary at @entity65 and there will be a separate permanent secretary in charge of the @entity14 , responsible for ‘ joined - up government ’ and cutting costs			1
there has long been disquiet among the @entity84 that the cabinet secretary – nicknamed @entity0 from his initials – held too much sway			1
they fear @entity90 technocrats have become more powerful than elected ministers			0
@entity93 @entity92 said yesterday on his blog : ‘ it is these permanent officials that really decide most public policy			0
all too often , elected ministers end up as mere mouthpieces for the machine			0
‘ it is precisely because we have such a smug , insulated technocracy in charge that voters are left complaining that no matter who they vote for , things rarely seem to change			0
’ asked why the job of cabinet secretary was being split , the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ he is head of a department that has around 2,000 people			1
‘ you are head of the @entity12 and all the permanent secretaries report to you , and you are secretary to the @entity14 and principal adviser to the prime minister			1
it is a very big job			0
’ if sir @entity0 wants to move to the private sector , he will have to submit his bid to the @entity126			0
it allows former civil servants to take up such positions within as little as three months .			0

@entity64 will replace cabinet secretary
