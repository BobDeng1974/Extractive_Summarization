a film about homosexual wartime codebreaker and father of modern computing @entity3 has been attacked by his biographer			1
@entity6 hero @entity3 played a key role in breaking the @entity9 enigma code during the @entity10 while working at @entity11			1
he is credited with saving thousands of lives during the conflict			1
but a new @entity15 funded film about his life has been lambasted for exaggerating a love affair with a woman , played by @entity19 , and making a fictional connection to a notorious spy			1
@entity3 was a well known homosexual			1
@entity6 hero @entity3 ( left ) played a key role in breaking the @entity9 enigma code during the @entity10 while working at @entity11			1
@entity24 ( right ) is set to play him in an @entity15 funded film the @entity26 is based on a biography by @entity28 , an @entity30 maths academic			1
it is set to star @entity24 as @entity3 and fellow @entity33 codebreaker @entity32 will be played by @entity19 as @entity3 's girlfriend - despite the fact that he was gay			1
the @entity36 reports that mr @entity28 has been sent a script of the film and is ' alarmed by the inaccuracies it '			2
he said : ' they have built up the relationship with @entity32 much more than it actually was			0
' he said while the couple had been ' briefly engaged ' , it was said that he liked her because he could talk to her as if she were really another man ' and there had never been much physical contact			0
he said the casting of @entity19 in the role , did not ' strike him as right			1
' fellow @entity33 codebreaker @entity32 ( left ) is set to be played by @entity19 ( right ) as @entity3 's girlfriend - despite the fact that he was gay he said : ' i 'm not being rude about her , but @entity32 was no glamourpuss			1
' the film follows the break - up of their relationship , which happened because @entity3 was unable to live a lie by marrying her			1
but @entity28 is said to be more concerned about the main story line , which invents a fictional relationship between @entity3 and @entity67 , who was later identified as the fifth man in the @entity70 spy ring that included @entity72 and @entity73			2
people who worked on separate projects at @entity33 were kept apart and @entity28 labeled the scenario ' ludicrous ' adding that @entity3 and @entity67 would never have met			1
he said : ' their relationship is invented			0
' the paper reports that a line in the script , which sees @entity3 confronted by a colleague who tells him ' no wonder they think you are a spy ' , has now been removed			2
the film was written by @entity85 and is to be directed by the @entity87 @entity86 whose last production was the violent thriller headhunters , and produced by @entity90			0
@entity6 hero @entity3 played a key role in breaking the @entity9 enigma code during the @entity10 while working at @entity11 ( pictured )			1
he is credited with saving thousands of lives during the conflict @entity3 led the team at @entity11 that cracked the @entity97 code , allowing the @entity98 to anticipate every move the @entity9 made @entity28 is said to have written to mr @entity85 about his concerns about the script , including criticisms that it showed nothing of @entity3 's ' extraordinary skills as a scientist and computer designer '			1
he said he was told they were going to make more of his marathon running and see him having more interaction with colleagues to make him look less wimpish			0
@entity3 led the team at @entity11 that cracked the @entity97 code , allowing the @entity98 to anticipate every move the @entity9 made			1
he is now widely recognised as a computing pioneer			0
they were tasked with breaking the @entity9 codes , transmitted on complex devices called @entity6 machines , which encrypted words into as many as 15 million million possible combinations			1
he also deciphered the codes that ensured the d - day invasion could go ahead as planned			0
but his work was ill - rewarded after the war			0
forbidden to talk about his secret activities , he took a teaching post at @entity124 , where he became involved with a 19 - year - old youth called @entity126			0
@entity3 turned a blind eye to @entity126 pilfering petty cash from him , but when a sentimentally valuable watch went missing , he unwisely reported the crime to the police			2
the police investigating the robbery turned their attentions to @entity3 ’s private life and he was convicted of gross indecency and given the choice by the court of going to jail or accepting ‘ chemical castration ’ – a course of the female hormone oestrogen to lower his libido			2
the persecution and police surveillance turing found himself under ( there were fears that , at the height of the @entity152 , his homosexuality would make him a target for blackmail by @entity156 spies ) wore him down			0
in june 1954 , he decided to imitate his favourite film , @entity159 ’s @entity158 - which he had watched seven times - and fatally bit into an apple coated with cyanide			0
mr @entity90 said the film was a drama , not a piece of entertainment and added while they do not want to invent events , there are some ' creative liberties '			0
he added : ' when we come over , we are also going to get in touch with some other experts on that period			0
we know how very important @entity3 is to you over there			2
' @entity3 led the team at @entity11 that cracked the @entity97 code , allowing the @entity98 to anticipate every move the @entity180 is now widely recognised as a computing pioneer			1
