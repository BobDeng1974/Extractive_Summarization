the town of @entity1 may have been swept up in @entity3 euphoria , but @entity4 has instructed his players to approach this weekend 's semi-final like any other day at work			1
it has been 88 years since the @entity1 last reached the last - four juncture and the @entity11 side travel to @entity12 facing the unenviable task of overcoming in - form @entity14			1
@entity1 are striving to make the @entity3 final for the first time in their history , leading to excitement understandably building in @entity20 - if not the club 's @entity22 training ground			1
@entity1 overcame @entity25 side @entity24 with a 3 - 0 replay win to progress to @entity3 semi-final @entity4 , a winner as player and coach at @entity31 , has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion , with progression the only objective			1
' i think when you go through to semi-finals , the only way to enjoy it is to win the game , ' the @entity1 manager said			2
' you ca n't go to @entity12 and play the occasion			2
it is not about playing the occasion , we 're playing @entity14			2
' for us , it has to be a day of work			0
we have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch			0
the @entity1 face @entity51 giants @entity14 in crunch clash on saturday at @entity12 ' the supporters can go and enjoy the day , that 's their little reward for a cup run			1
' for us , it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through			0
' @entity4 is confident his players can make history on saturday , even though few outsiders share his faith			2

it has been 88 years since @entity1 last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the @entity3 ' they look strong , well - balanced , ' @entity4 said			1
' they 're winning games			0
' they have terrific players			0
great problems for us to solve			0
' maybe they have left their run too late to catch @entity31 at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly			0
' @entity1 have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final , with @entity91 fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of tuesday 's 1 - 0 loss to table - topping @entity94			1
@entity4 was appointed @entity1 manager in december 2014 to replace @entity96 @entity4 felt defeat was harsh on his side , stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter - final replay against @entity24			1
' @entity3 competitions , one - off games , we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom , a little less nervousness , if you like , ' the @entity1 boss said			1
' i think the league campaign has been disappointing			0
there is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice			0
@entity1 have struggled in the @entity11 but have brought @entity3 euphoria to the town with their great run ' i think that is reflected in the game ( against @entity94 ) , when we are knocking at the door in the last 10 minutes and knocking on the door very , very much			2
' @entity94 , because they 're on a winning run , know how to get over the line and win at the moment			0
