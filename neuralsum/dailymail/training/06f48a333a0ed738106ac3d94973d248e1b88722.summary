by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 05:48 est , 8 february 2013 curriculum reform : @entity2 will drop large parts of the @entity4 from the classroom @entity2 yesterday dropped the @entity4 from the school curriculum – as @entity4 laws were blamed for helping to sink his flagship plans to scrap gcses			1
pupils will no longer be required to learn about the organisation in geography lessons while citizenship classes will merely specify studying the @entity17 ’s ‘ relations with the rest of @entity16 ’			1
the move is part of the @entity21 ’s far - reaching overhaul of the curriculum for primary and secondary schools aimed at restoring knowledge and rigour and reversing a trend for politically - correct causes to creep into lessons			1
youngsters will study a broad sweep of history , leave primary school with a basic mastery of grammar and learn all their times tables by the age of nine			0
but on a day of major education announcements , mr @entity2 was forced to abandon his plans to replace gcses in key subjects with tough @entity42			2
he admitted that a key plank – allowing just one exam board to set tests in each subject – was currently unworkable			0
fears the move would fall foul of @entity4 procurement laws are said to have played a part in mr @entity2 ’s decision to shelve the changes , as he was said to have been reluctant to become mired in legal wrangling			1
while the name @entity57 will remain , many of his other changes remain intact , including toughening up the exams , scrapping bite - sized modules and minimising coursework and internal assessment			0
as mr @entity2 told the @entity63 his reforms had gone a ‘ bridge too far ’ and he had ‘ cut his losses ’ , it emerged his proposed new geography curriculum for secondary schools would no longer require pupils to learn about the @entity4			1
@entity72 ’s 2007 curriculum required pupils to study ‘ different parts of the world in their wider settings and contexts , including the @entity4 ’ , and the impact of enlarging the @entity4 on large - scale migration			1
however , @entity86 mr @entity2 ’s new curriculum says simply ‘ relations with the rest of @entity16 ’			1
last night a @entity89 source said : ‘ the @entity4 is a political and economic entity rather than a geographical phenomenon , so we and our expert group agreed that teaching about it should not be specified in the geography programmes of study			1
’ mr @entity2 said the revamped gcses would be introduced in key subjects in september 2015 with the first exams being taken in 2017			2
league tables will be overhauled so they no longer rank schools according to the proportion of pupils achieving five a * to c grades , amid concerns that teachers are encouraged to concentrate on pupils on the @entity108			1
revenge : @entity2 made the move after @entity4 laws blocked his education reforms			1
file picture in a further reform , every year a random sample of pupils will be given tests in an attempt to gauge whether national standards are rising or falling			0
meanwhile the new curriculum is intended to give every pupil a bank of core knowledge and replace what mr @entity2 described as the ‘ vapid happy talk ’ in the current documents			2
it will be compulsory only in schools maintained by local authorities			0
the failure of comprehensives to give pupils a grounding in a core of traditional subjects – exposed in new @entity137 figures – lies behind mr @entity2 ’s reforms			1
at @entity142 , about a quarter of state schools and colleges – more than 500 – failed to equip a single pupil with top grades in three academic disciplines last summer			0
and at @entity57 , just 23 per cent of state school pupils were even given the chance to sit gcses in six academic subjects , and even fewer – 16 per cent – gained c - grade passes in them all			0
in a powerful speech this week , mr @entity2 said his ‘ @entity42 ’ league table measure – the percentage of pupils achieving cs or better in six academic gcses – had shown ‘ how poorly served so many state students were ’			2
at @entity160 pass you can secure in some papers with just 30 per cent of the questions correct , ’ he said			0
criticising a ‘ lack of ambition ’ , he lamented that just a quarter of secondaries – 766 – responded to a @entity137 initiative which enabled them to send pupils to visit a top university			0
he said the education establishment had reacted with ‘ visceral horror ’ to attempts to promote traditional subjects , branding them ‘ elitist ’ and ‘ backward - looking ’ , even though parents paying for private schools demanded these subjects as a right			0
poorer pupils were being denied opportunities open to a privileged elite , he warned			0
a memo from mr @entity2 ’s department to the @entity63 select committee defending his plans to replace gcses in core subjects said many of the world ’s highest performing countries insisted on a core of academic disciplines until pupils reached 16			2
it said the goal was to provide ‘ students with the level of knowledge and skills expected in the highest - performing jurisdictions ’ .			0

pupils will no longer be taught about the body in geography
move is part of overhaul of curriculum for primary and secondary schools
may be an act of *vengeance* after @entity4 scuppered @entity2 *'s* reforms
