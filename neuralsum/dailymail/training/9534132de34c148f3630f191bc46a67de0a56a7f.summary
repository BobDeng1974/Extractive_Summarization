by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 16:51 est , 8 november 2012 a death row inmate has been saved from execution just hours before he was scheduled to die today by lethal injection for the murder of a teenage girl			2
the 3rd @entity7 @entity6 today sent the case of 56 - year - old @entity9 back to a district court judge for additional proceedings			1
the @entity13 inmate had faced a 7pm ( est ) execution for the 1993 killing of 16 - year - old @entity16 in @entity17			1
stay of execution : @entity19 , 56 ( pictured left ) was set to be executed by lethal injection tonight in @entity13 after he murdered teenager @entity21 ( right ) in 1993 he would have been the first person executed in the state since 1999 and the only one in the past 50 years who had not voluntarily given up on his appeals			1
his defense lawyers welcomed the decision and said their client has ' compelling legal claims which have never been reviewed by any court '			0
the attorney general 's office declined to comment over the killer 's stay of execution at @entity34 in @entity13			1
@entity35 pleaded guilty to murdering @entity36 after kidnapping her in @entity17			1
at a 1997 hearing , his former public defender testified that @entity35 told him how he picked up the girl hitchhiking , bound her with electrical cord , raped her and killed her on state game land			1
he was not charged with rape due to a lack of physical evidence , though prosecutors suspected it			0
@entity35 confessed to his brother , who located her remains about a month after she disappeared and called police			1
miss @entity16 had been shot in the head and chest			0
stay of execution : @entity9 was 37 years old when he was convicted in 1993 attorneys for @entity35 have previously argued that his @entity57 's syndrome prevented him from accepting a life sentence he was originally offered			1
the disorder can cause sufferers to have trouble with social situations , be uncomfortable with changes in routine or have heightened sensitivities to certain situations			0
since he was sentenced to death , @entity35 had abandoned his appeals but later resumed a legal fight , saying he had been confined under circumstances at @entity70 that worsened mental health problems			1
those problems got better after he was transferred , his lawyers have argued			0
at wednesday 's pardons board hearing , the victim 's mother , @entity74 , set the tone for relatives and friends who made emotional pleas to keep the execution on track			0
mrs @entity16 said : ' he kidnapped her , he raped her and then he executed her			2
' as she begged him not to kill her , he shot her three times			0
' with regards the stay of execution , the circuit court panel directed the district court to address , among other things , whether @entity35 's appeal should be considered a successive petition that is subject to stricter rules , whether ' extraordinary circumstances ' existed and whether a district court proceeding is needed to consider the merits of @entity35 's claims			2
in a filing on thursday , the attorney general 's office said @entity35 is pursuing a ' successive ' federal appeal that is subject to more strict court rules			2
halted : the murderer 's execution at @entity34 prison in @entity13 was stopped by judges at the eleventh hour today prosecutors wrote : ' @entity35 's entire argument was that , since the time of his voluntary waiver , the circumstances of his confinement have improved and effected some concomitant amelioration of his spirit			1
he has developed relationships ... and he has changed his mind			0
' even if true , this argument is in no way similar to a complaint of error at the district court proceeding based on failure to exhaust , procedural default , or the relevant statute of limitations			0
' @entity13 has more than 200 people on death row , the greatest number after @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			2
the lack of executions has been attributed to a number of factors			0
prosecutors claim an anti-death penalty bias on the part of appeals ' judges , while defense attorneys note many of the sentences have been proved to be flawed and overturned on legitimate legal grounds .			0

@entity35 , 56 , was scheduled to be first person executed in @entity13 for 13 years
@entity35 murdered 16 - year - old @entity21 two decades *ago*
