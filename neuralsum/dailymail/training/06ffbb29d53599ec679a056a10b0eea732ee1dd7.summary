by @entity0 last updated at 6:32 pm on 6th october 2011 their reputation suggests they may be reluctant to , but @entity5 can well afford to stand their round in the pub , research suggests			1
along with those in the @entity10 and @entity11 they enjoy the cheapest pints in the country , a study has shown			1
and they have the advantage of supping their pints while tucking into some of the best pub food in the most pleasant surroundings in the @entity22 , according to the @entity24 guide			2
the guide found that pies are the most popular food item in pubs a pint of your favourite bitter would cost you £ 2.87 on average in the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity5 , compared with £ 3.15 in @entity32 and the @entity33 , the guide found			1
but cost is not the only reason to head up north - the guide also states that city pubs lack the ' character ' and ' charm ' to be found in country inns			2
it described town and city drinking holes as ' pleasant enough ' , with ' okay ' levels of service , but said it appeared that furnishings often came from a vast warehouse hidden away in an anonymous ' off - motorway wasteland '			2
pubs brewing their own ale charge just under £ 2.50 a pint , with scarcely any increase over the past year , compared with a seven per cent rise every where else , said the guide			1
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity5 £ 2.87 @entity59 £ 2.88 @entity60 £ 2.90 @entity61 £ 2.95 @entity62 £ 2.99 @entity63 £ 3.04 @entity64 £ 3.11 @entity32 £ 3.15 pie and ale is what most people want as the annual guide also discovered that the most popular food pub goers went for was steak and ale pie , closely followed by fish and chips , often given a boozy spin by being ' beer - battered '			1
@entity75 scored zero in a list of top food choices , with curry , sausage and mash and ham and egg also slipping well down the popularity stakes			2
good quality coffee was said to be available in nearly all good pubs , although the guide said it was a ' shame ' that almost half of pubs in the @entity22 did not open until noon			2
@entity89 , editor of the @entity90 , said : ' today 's number one food choice for pub - goers is steak in ale pie , in all it glorious variations : steak in ale - @entity99 - stout - red wine , with mushrooms , stilton , kidneys , oysters			0
' other pies follow , like all types of fish , chicken , pork , lamb , rabbit , shepherd 's , venison , wild boar , duckling , goose			0
and they love suet puddings too			0
' charm : country pubs like @entity119 in @entity120 near the @entity121 have more ' character ' than their city counterparts pricey : customers are expected to part with more cash for food and drink at venues like the @entity129 gastro pub in @entity32 's @entity130 the guide , launched 30 years ago , lists pubs , landlords and dining pubs of the year			1
@entity135 , @entity136 's deputy leader , said : ' it comes as no surprise that in these challenging economic times that folk are plumping for pub comfort food with dishes such as steak and ale pie and fish and chips			0
it is the kind of food that @entity22 does best			0
thrifty : the @entity90 has found it is cheaper to enjoy your favourite tipple in northern parts of the @entity22 ' however , the government could do more to make the pint of a pub - goer cheaper by not increasing excise duty by two per cent above the rate of inflation every year			1
' such a move is destroying @entity22 's pub trade and stunting growth			0
' @entity163 , national officer of the @entity164 said : ' since the @entity90 was first published the beer orders were introduced in 1989			0
' the aim was to foster competition to increase consumer choice and bring down prices			0
' the opposite of this aim has been achieved			0
the average price for a pint of lager in @entity22 has risen by 80p higher than justified by inflation and changes in taxes in pubs , as property companies replaced brewers as owners			1
' local pubs owned by property companies have been priced out of the market and widespread pub closures have resulted particularly in working class areas in @entity22			0
he added that the average price of a pint of lager increased by 46 per cent between 1991 and 2000 compared to a 27 per cent rise in inflation			1
between 2000 and 2010 the average price of a pint of lager increased by 47 per cent compared to a 31 per cent increase in inflation , said mr @entity163 .			1

average price of a pint is *30p* less than in @entity32
