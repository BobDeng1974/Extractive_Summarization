the best views of @entity4 are from the air - as five @entity8 @entity7 wingsuit flyers reveal in this video			2
the incredible footage shows the daredevils skydiving above one of the world 's most recognised skylines - @entity13 - after taking the plunge from an plane 7,500ft above the @entity18			1
but , like real pros , the team do n't even pause to give it a second thought as they leap from the plane and hurtle at 120mph towards a barge with a landing pad which is waiting for them on the river			1
now that 's a view : four members of the @entity8 @entity7 did their best impersonation of @entity31 , wearing wingsuits and buzzing the skyline at 120 mph the plunge from a plane 7,500ft above the city was part of the 2014 @entity37 in @entity38 despite the narrow landing pad , the flyers avoid a dunking in the river by expertly swooping down on the barge using their parachutes to slow them down			1
the flight , which was part of the 2014 @entity37 at @entity46 in @entity38 , started over @entity13 's financial district before heading uptown , passing the skyscrapers of the @entity49			0
the troop was made up of wingsuit flyers @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 are part of the @entity8 @entity7 ( @entity58 )			2
the crew started at the southern tip of @entity13 , above the @entity49 , and flew west over the island the gliders flew between the buildings and landed safely on a barge on the @entity18 ' being from @entity4 , this is so special and i ’ve been dreaming about this since i was a kid , ' said @entity53 , who grew up just north of the city			1
' it ’s been years of looking up at the big buildings and wondering if there is a day that i can fly over them			0
' that day was today			0

as the plane soars above @entity18 the daredevils take the plunge
they fall at a *staggering* 120mph towards a landing strip on a barge
flyers *buffer* fall with parachute and stay high and *dry* avoiding water
