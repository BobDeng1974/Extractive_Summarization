@entity12 , 59 , from @entity13 , was diagnosed with respiratory issues in 2007 and was told by doctors that someone who ate as much microwave popcorn as he did might well be in danger of inhaling hazardous vapours from the butter flavouring , diacetyl			1

scroll down for @entity28 verdict : @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity3 has won a $ 7 million verdict in the so - called ' popcorn lung ' case after he contracted a respiratory condition from the butter flavouring of microwave popcorn ' who would ever reasonably think that popping popcorn in your own home , no matter how its packaged or processed would all of a sudden turn into an agent for toxic lung disease , ' said @entity12			1
but lawyers for the supermarket chain responded saying they ' might have well have warned that there are aliens popping out of the bags because there â€™s just as much support for that			0
