@entity0 - the building blocks of life - has been turned into literal building blocks , like very , very small @entity4 , creating an alphabet where each letter is 1,000th the thickness of a human hair			1
researchers at @entity10 have come up with a method for building tiny structures out of synethetic dna strands , which are programmed to assemble themselves into the alphabet			1
but this is n't just scientists showing off - the method could be used to create tiny organic ' machines ' that swim inside the human body to deliver drugs directly to diseased areas			1
researchers at @entity10 have come up with a method for building tiny structures out of synethetic dna strands , which are programmed to assemble themselves into an alphabet researchers at the @entity24 at @entity10 have developed a method for building complex nanostructures out of short synthetic strands of @entity0			1
called single - stranded tiles ( @entity30 ) , these interlocking @entity0 ' building blocks ' could be the foundation of future generations of organic machines			1
@entity0 is best known as a keeper of genetic information - but scientists are increasingly investigating it as a way to ' build ' tiny organic structures for use inside the body			2
but in an emerging field of science known as @entity0 nanotechnology , it is being explored for use as a material with which to build tiny , programmable structures to ' build ' objects			2
to date , most research has focused on the use of a single long biological strand of @entity0 , which acts as a backbone along which smaller strands bind to its many different segments , to create shapes - a method called @entity0 origami			0
to date , most research has focused on the use of a single long biological strand of @entity0 , which acts as a backbone along which smaller strands bind to its many different segments , to create shapes - a method called @entity0 origami in focusing on the use of short strands of synthetic dna and avoiding the long scaffold strand , @entity63 's team developed an alternative building method			1
each @entity30 is a single , short strand of @entity0			0
one tile will interlock with another tile , if it has a complementary sequence of @entity0			0
if there are no complementary matches , the blocks do not connect			0
in this way , a collection of tiles can assemble itself into specific , predetermined shapes			0
in demonstrating the method , the researchers created just over one hundred different designs , including @entity84 characters , numbers , and fonts , using hundreds of tiles for a single structure of 100 nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) in size			2
the approach is simple , robust , and versatile			0
' @entity0 nanotechnology to create programmable nanodevices is an important focus at the @entity24 , because we believe so strongly in its potential to produce a paradigm - shifting approach to development of new diagnostics and therapeutics , ' said @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105			0

synthetic dna programmed to work as building blocks
spells alphabet and @entity84 letters
could be used to build organic ' machines ' to deliver drugs inside body
