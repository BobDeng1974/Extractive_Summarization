click here for all the goals , stats and heat maps in @entity5 's @entity4 lethal , @entity6 called him			2
it ’s been 153 days since @entity10 ’s manager last described one of his players in such ruthless , glowing terms but 11 minutes of @entity14 brought the phrase back into his vocabulary			1
it was a fitting description			2
introduced as a 68th minute substitute , @entity14 made his first sight of goal since last summer count , beautifully cushioning a ball from @entity23 with his left foot before flashing a drive with his right past @entity27 , the @entity28 goalkeeper			1
this was the norm last year , when @entity10 were pummelling teams in pursuit of the title , but the current season had lacked a cutting edge until now			1
this is the kind of contest @entity6 has seen his side labour in but the introduction of leading man secured an impressive 2 - 0 win			1
click here for more like this @entity10 have often flattered to deceive since @entity14 last appeared on august 31 , a combination of thigh and calf problems ruining the campaigns of player and team , but if this cameo against @entity28 is to be a guide , the season might yet end with a bang			1
‘ it was nice for him because he has been out such a long time , ’ said @entity6 , who had @entity65 open the scoring			1
‘ it is just about managing game time now , but when he gets into that area of the pitch , he is lethal			2
it helped us get the rewards for an outstanding performance			0
’ @entity6 enthusiasm was understandable			0
with six draws in their last eight matches at @entity46 , no @entity137 — rested , according to @entity6 , as a precaution due to a tight hamstring — and the lingering effects of their efforts against @entity143 in the @entity144 , this game had the recipe for trouble			0
@entity28 were aggressive from the start			0
@entity89 was a persistent source of irritation to @entity10 ’s technical players , while @entity94 seemed intent on bustling @entity6 ’ defenders out of their comfort zone			1
this was @entity94 ’s first return to @entity46 since @entity6 swiftly called time on his @entity10 career in 2012 and he seemed wound up by the occasion			1
his pre-match remarks — accusing @entity6 of ‘ lying ’ to him — lacked class and the same could be said of his performance			0
@entity65 gave @entity10 the lead in the 51st minute to put the @entity162 1 - 0 up at @entity46 against @entity28 sterling scores the opening goal for @entity10 at @entity46 after 51 minutes against @entity28 @entity65 runs away in celebration after putting @entity10 1 - 0 up at @entity46 against @entity28 in the @entity59 match @entity65 celebrates after scoring for @entity10 against @entity28 after going in 0 - 0 at half - time @entity65 slides on his knees to celebrate after scoring the opening goal at @entity46 @entity65 celebrates with @entity10 fans as the @entity162 went 1 - 0 up against @entity28 in the second half @entity65 is piled on by his team - mates as @entity72 celebrates after going 1 - 0 up he was fortunate to get away with clattering @entity174 with his forearm after four minutes but was eventually booked for a stupid tackle on the same player			1
@entity94 injured himself in that moment and was promptly substituted			0
‘ when we had to deal with that pressure , we did , ’ said @entity6			0
‘ physicality is a big part of @entity94 ’s game but we were			0
the team stood up to that very well			0
’ by the time @entity94 hobbled off , @entity10 had taken the lead but the first goal should have come much earlier			1
only referee @entity106 will know why he never gave a penalty after @entity188 wrestled @entity65 to the ground in first half injury time			1
if that was baffling , so too was @entity68 ’s miss as play continued ; picking up the loose ball , the @entity191 dragged his shot wide from eight yards			1
@entity6 ’ exasperated reaction spoke volumes			0
within minutes of the restart , @entity71 scampered down the left and fizzed in a cross that found the twinkling feet of @entity23			2
he picked out @entity65 with instinctive pass and the @entity206 forward drilled his shot beyond @entity27			1
@entity6 repeatedly punched the air with glee			0
there is no margin for error in their pursuit of a top four place and breaking @entity28 ’s resistance was vital			0
taking the lead gave @entity6 the perfect platform to reintroduce @entity14 to a raucous reception			2
it got even louder when he provided the moment many had hoped for			0
the outstanding @entity23 set him away and he confidently manoeuvring himself into position before sweeping the ball past @entity27			0
@entity14 wheeled away , did that dance and @entity46 came to life			2
‘ i ’m excited about the whole collective , ’ @entity6 said			0
should he keep his lethal weapon fit for the final four months , reaching the @entity228 might not to be beyond the realms of fantasy after all			0
@entity14 photographed on the sidelines warming up during @entity10 's @entity59 match at @entity46 @entity14 came on in the 68th minute as he replaced @entity68 at @entity46 against @entity28 @entity137 ( far right ) reacts during the match as @entity10 miss a chance against @entity28 such was the relief around the stadium , every @entity10 player swarmed over to celebrate with @entity65 , while @entity6 repeatedly punched the air with glee			1
there is no margin for error in their pursuit of a top four place and breaking @entity28 ’s resistance was vital			0
taking the lead gave @entity6 the perfect platform then to reintroduce @entity14 and , predictably , the acclaim he received when making his grand entrance on 68 minutes was suitably loud ; 11 minutes later it had got even louder			1
he had already had one sight of goal before the outstanding @entity23 set him away and he was not in any mood to blow his moment , confidently manoeuvring himself into a position before drilling his shot beyond @entity27			2
much more of this and @entity10 reaching the @entity228 might not to be beyond the realms of fantasy			2
