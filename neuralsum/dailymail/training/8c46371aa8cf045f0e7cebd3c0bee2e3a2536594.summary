seven games in , and into the international break , let ’s assess who ’s been the best player so far in the @entity5			1
@entity6 ? not for me			1
my vote goes to @entity9			2
of course @entity6 has been brilliant			2
but he walked into a team that should have won the title last season – check out those dropped points late in the campaign against @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			0
he has arrived to find a calm environment , a club without turmoil , and not in a situation of seeing a great empire virtually ruined by one stinking , disastrous season			0
@entity9 has been the standout performer in the @entity5 so far this season @entity25 's £ 60million signed has contributed goals and assists so far for @entity28 @entity6 is the @entity5 's top goalscorer after seven games of the new season @entity6 ’s great start is put into shade by what @entity33 has done at @entity25 , where he walked into a huge challenge			1
if @entity33 keeps up his form for @entity25 and takes them back into the @entity38 , surely that is a far bigger achievement than anything any player might do at @entity42 this season ? let ’s put it into context : @entity25 were a shambles last season			1
after the glory of the @entity52 era , some of those players were on the floor under @entity54			0
when @entity58 , with his record of success and medals , says @entity54 had him “ doubting everything ” you can appreciate how low things had sunk at @entity62			0
it was so bad @entity64 fixed up a move and announced it mid-season – when did a top player do that at @entity25 ? with senior players disillusioned , @entity25 were heading in totally the wrong direction			1
they finished seventh and won nothing			0
then three members of the back four left - @entity58 , @entity64 and @entity72			0
on top of that the new manager could n’t start work until the @entity77 were out of the @entity78			0
throw in an injury crisis as the season got under way and you ’ll understand the gravity of the situation at @entity25			2
of course they ’ve spent money – they needed to given how awful last season was			0
but in the context of everything i ’ve just described , @entity28 deserves some credit			0
the most expensive signing has been @entity33			0
big money players need to make a big impact – @entity25 needed that instantly from the @entity97 wide man			1
some mega-money @entity5 players have struggled to have an impact - @entity100 and @entity101 are two examples			2
and then we get to the deals that make @entity33 look like a bargain at £ 60million			1
@entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 have commanded fees at @entity5 clubs that are eye - wateringly embarrassing for all involved			2
@entity111 has hit the ground running since moving to @entity42 from @entity113 in the summer @entity106 cost @entity114 £ 15million when the striker signed from @entity116 @entity107 is still trying to get over leaving @entity117 this time last year for £ 42million @entity106 - £ 35m of injuries			1
@entity107 - £ 42m to be a lazy lightweight who is struggling to deal with @entity117 rejection			1
@entity123 – a staggering £ 50m to miss sitters			0
he ’s been a joy to watch and effective as well			0
if all you do is give @entity127 to the top scorer or one of the champions , then @entity6 or @entity111 will walk it			1
but @entity33 is leading the @entity25 reconstruction			2
he ’s walked into a total mess at @entity62			0
but he has hit the ground running , and led @entity25 back into the top four with some first class performances			1
@entity134 striker @entity108 - now playing for @entity135 - cost @entity42 £ 50million when @entity25 players were reportedly furious with @entity28 for taking @entity33 off at @entity138 , then it ’s clear the impact this player is having			1
at £ 60m he ’s expected to instantly provide consistent quality to fulfill the expectations at @entity25			1
he does n’t have the security of a good defence behind him either			0
@entity6 has walked into an already very good @entity42 side			1
@entity33 arrived to find a big mess needed clearing up			0
he ’s got stuck in , got his hands dirty and started the clean - up operation			0
the fact that @entity33 is adding some polish with some sparkling performances is a bonus for @entity25			2
@entity153 one of the world 's top four - @entity155 like @entity158 's facebook page .			1

@entity25 star @entity9 has lit up the @entity5
the @entity97 arrived from @entity117 for £ 60million in the summer
@entity6 is the division 's top scorer at @entity42
@entity111 has also started well since being signed by @entity164
