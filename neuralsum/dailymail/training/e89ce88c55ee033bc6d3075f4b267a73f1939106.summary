privacy row : @entity1 are being sued over the way they harvest users ' personal information to target them with adverts a group of @entity9 and @entity11 users will sue @entity1 for secretly tracking their browsing habits so they can bombard them with targeted adverts			1
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , who all use @entity18 's safari browser , today won the right for the @entity20 to hear their claim			1
@entity1 argued that the @entity20 in @entity22 did not have jurisdiction to hear the case and said it should instead be heard in @entity25			1
the claimants , known as @entity27 against @entity1 's @entity28 , accuse @entity1 of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and target them with adverts			1
today mr @entity34 , sitting in the @entity20 , ruled that the courts were the ' appropriate jurisdiction ' to try their claims			0
a group spokesman said : ' the @entity1 argument that any trial should take place in @entity25 has not been accepted by the judge			1
' they say @entity1 's ' clandestine ' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among @entity51 users			2
they argued in court that @entity1 's bid to block a trial was ' misconceived ' and the company should ' answer to @entity51 justice '			1
they are accusing @entity1 of misuse of private information , breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws			1
@entity1 provides services including email and search facilities to web users for free , mr @entity34 said			1
' it can do this because it collects information from the users of its services which it then processes in such a way that it can sell to suppliers what appears as space on the users ' screens			0
' this can be used by them for advertisements which are targeted at the apparent interests of the users of devices who access the internet ' , the judge said			0
@entity89 case : @entity1 argued that the case should not go before the @entity20 and should instead be heard in @entity25 instead			1
they lost the battle and it will now go to trial ' what each of the claimants claims in the present case is that they have suffered acute distress and anxiety			2
none of them claims any financial or special damage			0
' @entity103 , for @entity1 , had argued the information was not in fact private			0
the aggregation of such information sent to separate websites and advertising services can not make it private information			0
court battle : the trio of internet users taking action against @entity1 were all users of @entity18 's @entity118 on @entity11 or @entity9 ' one hundred times zero is zero , so one hundred pieces of non-private information can not become private information when collected together			1
' but the judge said : ' i find this a surprising submission to be made on behalf of @entity1 ' it would not collect and collate the information unless doing so enabled it to produce something of value			2
' the value it produces is the facility for targeted advertising of which the claimants complain , and which yields the spectacular revenues for which @entity1 is famous ' , the judge said			2
' i am satisfied that there is a serious issue to be tried in each of the claimants ' claims for misuse of private information			0
' a @entity1 spokeswoman said : ' a case almost identical to this one was dismissed in its entirety three months ago in the @entity147			2
' we still do n't think that this case meets the standards required in the @entity51 for it to go to trial , and we 'll be appealing today 's ruling			0
' @entity154 , director of @entity155 , said : ' it 's absolutely right people are able to access justice in @entity51 when the issue concerns a company that has a significant presence here and offers services to millions of @entity51 people			0
' this is an important case for privacy regulation , as it involved users making a specific choice about sharing data and being tracked that was not respected by @entity1			1
' it is an important principle that people are able to control who collects their information and how it is used and this case has the potential to enhance consumer protection and strengthen privacy in a number of areas			0
it is critical that companies respect the choices we make as consumers and this case could be a significant deterrent in future			0
' no date has yet been set for the full hearing .			0
