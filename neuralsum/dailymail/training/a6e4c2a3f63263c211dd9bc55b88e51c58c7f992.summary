@entity0 is mounting an extraordinary attempt to hijack efforts by consumers to contact its rivals			1
a partnership with the 118 118 directory enquiry service means callers asking for the number of any energy company are met with a hard sell for @entity0			1
the 118 118 operator is required to highlight one of its fixed energy tariffs and talk up an incentive of a £ 50 high street shopping voucher			1
the same operator even offers to connect customers who had originally intended to contact a rival to @entity21 gas sales staff			1
plug : one of 118 118 's television adverts			2
the new partnership means that the operator is required to highlight one of its fixed energy tariffs and talk up an incentive of a £ 50 high street shopping voucher so a consumer who might originally have been trying to contact a small and cheap firm such as @entity31 is pushed towards @entity0 instead			1
the partnership between @entity0 and 118 118 raises new questions about whether consumers can trust the @entity36 energy firms to deal fairly with consumers amid allegations of rip - off prices and poor service			1
recent price rises mean that the cost of dialling 118 118 is hugely expensive , with a minimum charge from a landline ranging from £ 4.45 to £ 5.68			1
this bill can rise sharply if the call lasts any longer than necessary			0
and those dialling the service pay a fee to get a specific number , so they do not expect to be hit with an advertising message from a third party which may well increase the cost of the call			2
worse still , if connected to @entity0 via 118 118 they are then charged £ 2.57 a minute			1
@entity57 , of the @entity58 , said : ‘ i suppose it ’s hardly surprising			0
two companies , each with a controversial reputation over pricing , finding comfort in each other ’s company			0
‘ the 118 118 service does n’t offer value for money so our simple advice is do n’t bother to dial the directory service			2
‘ you save money and you do n’t have to listen to @entity0 advertising			2
two birds of a feather with one stone			0
’ energy firms have run into severe trouble over mis - selling			2
in july @entity0 was ordered to pay £ 1million to customers after selling energy deals to shoppers in @entity86 ’s stores using misleading claims about possible savings			1
it has lost hundreds of thousands of customers in the past 18 months as families switch to cheaper independent rivals			0
the deal being promoted by 118 118 involves fixing energy tariffs until the end of march 2016			1
it suggests this will lead to an average annual bill of £ 1,193 and comes with a £ 50 @entity98 gift voucher			0
however , cheaper fixed rate deals are available			0
@entity31 , for example , has a 12 - month deal with an annual average bill of £ 1,011			2
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity0 advertises in a variety of ways , including this type of paid - for promotion			1
it is similar to paying for adverts that appear on the internet alongside search engine results			0
’ the 118 118 service is operated by @entity112 , a subsidiary of @entity116 directory enquiries provider @entity114 spokesman said : ‘ when customers request a specific number , our call agents always supply it quickly and accurately			2
‘ occasionally we have some great special offers that are related to their enquiry			0
fair ? the partnership between @entity0 and 118 118 raises new questions about whether consumers can trust the @entity36 energy firms to deal fairly with consumers amid allegations of rip - off prices and poor service ‘ if customers are interested in this offer , our call agents ask whether they would like the additional number of the company that is offering the promotion			1
we ’re keen to bring added value to our customers			0
’ the firm said its activities comply with the industry code of practice covering premium rate telephone lines , policed by watchdog @entity145			0
ovo commercial director @entity146 said : ‘ this is not the way to rebuild trust in an industry currently suffering from the lowest level of customer confidence in its history			0
‘ we urge customers to shop around for the best deals and not to fall for these sorts of aggressive marketing tactics which often results in signing up to a deal that is more expensive			0
