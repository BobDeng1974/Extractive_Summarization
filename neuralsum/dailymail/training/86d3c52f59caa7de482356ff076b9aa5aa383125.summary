by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 12:14 est , 3 may 2012 it is a mystery that has perplexed historians for more than 400 years - what ever became of the 120 settlers who tried to establish @entity6 's first colony on the north - east coast of @entity8 ? queen elizabeth i and famed explorer sir @entity10 had hoped the expedition in the 1580s would create a capital in the @entity15 , but something went terribly wrong			1
the men , women and children simply vanished - possibly massacred by @entity20 - any evidence of a settlement disappeared and the infamous ' lost colony ' became rooted in @entity25 folklore			1
but solving the centuries - old mystery may have come a step closer this week after experts identified a tantalising clue hidden in a map drawn by a man on that fateful voyage			2
riddle in invisible ink : the map ( left ) of @entity36 in @entity8 drawn by @entity37 during an attempt to create @entity6 's first colony reveals a hidden possible location for the settlement when it was illuminated from underneath ( right ) in recent tests			1
the colony disappeared in mysterious circumstances in the 1580s shedding new light : in this close - up of the patch at the centre of the map , a lozenge , the symbol for a fort , can clearly be seen			1
the symbol was drawn in invisible ink and further concealed with a piece of paper glued on top showing the way : this image shows the hidden marking under ultraviolet light			1
historians hope to excavate the site in the hope it will uncover more clues to the fate of the settlers tests have found a hint at the possible location of what may have been intended as the colony 's capital near @entity36 , apparently drawn in invisible ink			1
the ' x-marks - the - spot ' is shown in the form of a lozenge , the symbol for a fort , on the map drawn by @entity37 , who accompanied @entity10 's first attempt to establish the colony and who led the settlers on their quest to set up the ' @entity82 '			1
the ink , which is also disguised by a piece of paper glued to it , was likely put together using milk , citrus juice or urine , as was common at the time			1
its use during the ' lost colony expedition ' also sheds light on an era of political suspicion at the time			1
location , location , location : @entity96 is located just off what is now the state of @entity99			2
@entity37 's maps have been praised for being particularly accurate journey back in time : a modern - day map of the colony 's location on the north - east coast of @entity8 were they slaughtered ? this painting by @entity37 shows native @entity8 dancing in a religious ceremony during an expedition in 1585			1
many believe the ' lost colony ' were massacre by @entity20 folklore : @entity37 returns to @entity96 in 1590 to find the settlers have quite simply vanished after he had gone back to @entity6 to fetch more supplies among the most popular forms of invisible ink is lemon juice , but others have included urine and milk			1
the acid from the citrus juice weakens the paper and can then be shown with the application of heat			2
invisible ink dates as far back as the first century , when @entity129 officer @entity128 explained how the milk of the thithymallus plant could be used			2
during the @entity134 , @entity133 and @entity25 spies used a mixture of ferrous sulfate and water for a similar effect			0
during the late 19th and early 20th century , carbon copies were used for secret writing			0
the @entity141 used a paper that contained a special chemical that would be invisibly transferred to a second sheet of paper			0
the message could then be developed by using water or heat			0
plotters were attempting to place @entity151 @entity150 on the throne and there were concerns the map may be found by court spies			0
now farmland , the site will be excavated , it was expected to be announced today			1
professor @entity159 , from the @entity160 and a director of the @entity162 , who made a request for tests to be carried out on the map , said he delighted with the findings			0
' i marvelled at it , ' he told @entity170			0
' it was as if sir @entity10 had sent me an email saying " this was my ... capital " '			0
@entity37 drew the map - in pen , brown ink and watercolour - after setting out on the voyage in the 1580s			0
a notable artist , his map is considerably accurate and his other works are held in the @entity181			0
having landed in @entity8 , the settlers realised they had insufficient supplies , so @entity37 went back home to get more			2
but when new stocks arrived , they had completely disappeared			0
expansion plans : famed explorer sir @entity10 ( left ) and @entity188 ( right ) had hoped the expedition would create a capital in the @entity15 called the ' @entity82 ' by the time they landed in 1587 , it was too late to plant crops for the season , so @entity37 returned to @entity6 for supplies			1
however , @entity37 arrived in @entity6 to find his country at war with @entity199			1
constant sea battles closed the @entity201 to nonmilitary vessels and prevented his return to the coast of @entity99 until 1590			0
he found that the settlers he had left behind on @entity36 had completely disappeared			2
it is believed they may have re-located to @entity208 ( now @entity208 ) , but this has never been proved			0
in 1607 , after several failed attempts , @entity210 in the @entity211 became the first permanent settlement in what is now known as the @entity25			0
it would serve as capital of the colony for 83 years .			2

settlers who tried to establish @entity6 's first colony simply vanished
possible site of ' @entity82 ' concealed with lemon juice or urine
excavation of farmland location hopes to unearth clues to their fate
