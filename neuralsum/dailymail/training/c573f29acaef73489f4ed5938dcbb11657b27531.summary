by @entity0 the family of sir @entity2 , pictured , have been accused of extortion for charging authors to use his characters a judge has accused the family of @entity7 creator sir @entity2 of extortion by charging authors a fee to use his most famous characters			1
heirs to the literary rights of the author had filed an appeal with the @entity16 @entity15 in a bid to stop the publication of a book based on the characters @entity7 and dr @entity21 , insisting they must pay a license to use the characters			2
but a judge in the @entity16 has ruled that due to the copyright expiring on all but the last ten @entity7 stories , charging publishers and authors to use the characters amounted to extortion			1
according to the @entity31 , judge @entity29 of the @entity30 made the comments after author @entity33 refused to pay for the licence in his new book , in @entity36 of @entity7			1
previously he had ruled against the estate 's argument and said mr @entity33 was free to use the characters			1
now the judge has criticised the estate and ordered it to pay $ 30,000 in costs			0
judge @entity29 said : the @entity2 estate 's business strategy is plain ; charge a modest fee for which there is no legal basis , in the hope that the ' rational ' writer or publisher will pay it rather than incur a greater cost in challenging the legality of the demand			1
' it 's time the estate changed its business model			0
' however , lawyers for the estate said they were considering an appeal and said the judge 's comments were out of touch			0
mr @entity64 had previously paid for the licence in his first book a study in @entity67 , even though he did n't believe he needed to			2
@entity33 , left , refused to pay the $ 5,000 demanded by the family of sir @entity2 for his new book , right but he refused to pay a second time , which led to legal action			1
@entity2 wrote four novels and 56 short stories about the @entity75 - based sleuth which were published in the @entity16 between 1887 and 1927			2
@entity16 copyright protection for the novels and the first 46 stories has lapsed and they are now in the public domain , but the final ten stories remain under copyright			0
mr @entity33 argued that the essential characteristics of @entity7 and @entity21 , played by @entity84 and @entity85 in the @entity87 show , were established in the works already in the public domain for his latest book , mr @entity33 refused to pay and in june a federal appeals court in @entity92 ruled in his favour , sparking the latest court action			1
at the time @entity29 wrote : ' when a story falls into the public domain , story elements - including characters covered by the expired copyright - become fair game for follow - on authors			0
' mr @entity33 argued that the essential characteristics of @entity7 and @entity21 were established in the works already in the public domain			0
therefore , he says , he and his team are free to write new works based on them			0
in @entity108 , works are protected for 70 years after an author 's death meaning the works are long out of copyright .			0
