death rates relating to almost 5,000 surgeons have today been published , with just three doctors falling below the standards expected of them , it has emerged			1
data published as part of a ' transparency drive ' by the @entity8 reveals mortality rates across 13 different surgery specialties , including cardiac , lung cancer and vascular surgery			1
it shows ' almost all surgeons ' are ' within the limits expected by the @entity8 '			1
just three surgeons - a vascular , heart and colorectal consultant surgeon - were named as ' outliers ' , those found to be performing below the limits expected			1
the @entity8 has today published death rates for almost 5,000 surgeons across 13 specialties , including cardiac , lung cancer and vascular surgery ( file image ) @entity29 , a heart surgeon at the @entity31 , was among those whose death rates were found to be significantly worse than average , when the data was collated 18 months ago			1
mr @entity29 performs a vast number of very high risk operations , a spokesman for @entity38 and @entity39 , told @entity40			0
he was found to have a risk - adjusted hospital mortality rate of 6.63 per cent over a three - year period , during which he performed more than 500 surgeries			1
dr @entity44 , medical director for @entity38 and @entity39 , said : ' the data shown was taken more than 18 months ago and in the light of these outcomes , we reviewed @entity29 's practice in detail with the support of an @entity52 from the @entity53			0
' the unadjusted mortality rates for his surgery for the period april 2013 to october 2014 was 1.8 per cent , which is within the expected rates			1
' we have a track record for accepting very high risk patients including a significant number of patients with active endocarditis for whom even a high surgical risk is seen as offering a better outcome than medical management			0
hospital consultants who refuse to publish their patient death rates will be sacked under a transparency drive , the @entity8 revelaed this week			1
cancer units will also have to publish statistics showing how many patients survive their treatment , allowing patients to compare services			1
the warning came days before a third of the country 's consultants were expected to refuse to publish their performance statistics today			0
sir @entity80 , medical director of @entity81 , warned that from next year consultants who do not allow their data to be published will not pass their five - yearly revalidation or be awarded financial bonuses			1
' since the data was taken more than 18 months ago , the unit has reviewed many of its protocols and practices which have been informed and updated by an @entity92 from the @entity53 and the effectiveness of these changes is evidenced by unadjusted mortality rates for the unit in 2013 and 2014 of 2.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively , which are within the expected rates			1
' @entity98 , a colorectal surgeon at @entity99 , was identified as another surgeon with below average mortality rates			1
of 50 patients treated by mr @entity98 over an 18 - month period , six died , giving him a mortality rate of 14 per cent			2
@entity105 , acting medical director at the trust , told @entity40 : ' this trust has acknowledged its outlier status and that of one of its surgeons			0
' it has confirmed that measures have been taken to improve outcomes with a comprehensive overhaul of the colorectal service in 2012 - 2013 and close scrutiny of any deaths to identify potential surgical or system failings			0
' the cumulative nature of data reporting means that it is likely to be at least another year before the @entity39 and surgeon cease to be outliers			0
' @entity127 serves one of the more deprived communities in the country and the colorectal service accepts very high risk patients with multiple co-morbidities , which increases the risk of complications following colorectal cancer surgery			2
' the investigations at the @entity39 into each of the six deaths highlighted within the report confirms that they were high risk / complex patients			0
just three surgeons were found to fall below the average for mortality rates in their particular areas ( file image ) ' we have made significant changes to the pre-operative assessment and risk adjustment , prehabilitation and post-operative management of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery , which has resulted in a reduction in mortality at @entity127			1
' the data published regarding mr @entity98 is in excess of 18 months old , but as part of the @entity39 ’s review of mr @entity98 ’s practice we are able to confirm that from april 2013 - august 2014 he has performed 45 colorectal cancers resections with zero mortality			1
' the third ' outlier ' surgeon is @entity166 , a vascular surgeon at the @entity167 and @entity168			0
he was found to have a risk - adjusted mortality rate of 10.4 per cent over three years for carotid endarterectomies - an operation to reduce the risk of a person suffering a stroke			2
the national average for the same procedure was two per cent			1
the trust told the @entity178 : ' the overall three - year rate for mr @entity166 reflects a series of strokes in 2011			0
' the rate of strokes / deaths within 30 days for mr @entity166 between october 2011 and september 2013 is 6.4 per cent , and this rate is consistent with the outcomes of other vascular surgeons			0
' @entity8 @entity81 first launched the league tables last year , but extended the data available to cover 13 specialties and an extra 1,000 consultant surgeons for 2014			1
the data is being published on a new website @entity193 , allowing patients to compare critical data about hospitals , and the professionals who will treat them			1
health secretary @entity200 said the @entity8 is ' blazing a trail across the world as the first major health economy to adopt this kind of culture ' in a speech today , health secretary @entity200 , is expected to say : ' transparency is about patient outcomes , not process targets			1
' it uses the power of a learning culture and of peer review , not blame			0
' healthcare globally has been slow to develop the kind of safety culture based on openness and transparency that has become normal in the airline , oil and nuclear industries			0
' the @entity8 is now blazing a trail across the world as the first major health economy to adopt this kind of culture			2
' @entity8 @entity81 's medical director professor sir @entity80 who has championed better transparency in the @entity8 , said the website will help to drive up standards			1
' this represents another major step forward on the transparency journey , ' he said			2
' it will help drive up standards , and we are committed to expanding publication into other areas			0
' the results demonstrate that surgery in this country is as good as anywhere in the western world and , in some specialties , it is better			2
' the surgical community in this country deserves a great deal of credit for being a world leader in this area			0
' at the weekend sir @entity80 said penalties will be enforced against hospital consultants who refuse to publish patient death rates , with around 2,500 believed to not be taking part in the initiative			2
he told the @entity253 said : ' we are looking now at a series of inducements , penalties to force that ( publishing death rates )			0
' he added : ' we will lose some surgeons			0
we will , and have as a consequence of this endeavour			0
' @entity8 @entity81 's medical director professor sir @entity80 who has championed better transparency in the @entity8 , said the website will help to drive up standards but critics said the move to publish surgeon 's performance data is ' crude and misleading '			1
@entity271 , president of the @entity272 , which represents surgeons , said : ' there is now good anecdotal evidence that shows publishing this data has encouraged risk - averse behaviour , which is not in the interest of patients			2
' i believe that the data should only be published after any concerns in a surgeon 's performance have been investigated			0
' in reality very few deaths can be attributed to surgical error alone , and this data only attracts attention away from institutional failings			0
put simply , hospitals should not be allowing surgeons to practice unless they can demonstrate their practice is safe			2
' work to compile the data has again been led by the @entity295 ( @entity295 ) , which manages the @entity297 programme on behalf of @entity81 .			2

@entity81 has published mortality rates for almost 5,000 surgeons
just three were found to fall below the national average in their specialty
part of ' major transparency drive ' in the @entity8 allowing patients to see critical information about the hospitals and professionals treating them
launched last year but extended to cover 13 surgery specialties and an extra 1,000 consultant surgeons in 2014
