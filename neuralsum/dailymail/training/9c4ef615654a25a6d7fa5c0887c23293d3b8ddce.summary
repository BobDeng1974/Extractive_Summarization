@entity0 has taken a cheeky swipe at @entity4 's @entity2 after he voiced confidence of sinking @entity6 that exuberant assessment by the @entity25 loanee drew a smiling response from @entity0			1
‘ with the greatest of respect to @entity2 , i remember getting excited about my first hat - trick - but against 11 men , ’ said the @entity28 boss			1
‘ listen , he ’s entitled to his opinion and that ’s the way it is			2
‘ but maybe , just maybe , he ’s got caught up in the excitement of scoring his first hat - trick for @entity4 - which , of course , we congratulate him on			1
’ @entity40 striker @entity2 is on a season - loan at @entity4 from @entity42 champions @entity25 the 22 - year - old scored a hat - trick against @entity18 in the @entity8 , taking his tally to eight for the club @entity48 manager @entity47 has also stated that the ‘ best teams are in the top division ’ , implying that he sees @entity49 and @entity50 as greater semi-final dangers than @entity6			1
‘ in normal circumstances he would be right , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but in the last few years nothing has been what it seems in @entity59 football			0
we ’ve had anything but normal circumstances			0
‘ you have three of the five biggest clubs in the country playing in the championship			0
‘ that would tell us it ’s not normal circumstances			0
if it were normal then , yes , the three teams in the top - flight would be stronger than the team from the division below			2

as everyone can see from the bookies , @entity4 are 4/5 favourites , everybody else is 9/2			1

‘ there is no “ i want to avoid @entity4 at all costs ”			2
that could n’t be further from the truth			0
