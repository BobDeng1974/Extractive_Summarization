many will be deeply moved by the sight of a toddler beating her chest with tiny fists while a 300lb gorilla lounges alongside her , eating a kiwi fruit			0
they will laugh as the two toss straw over their heads and gasp when one of the world ’s largest primates leans forward to give the little girl a tender peck on the cheek			2
others , however , will be horrified			0
more than once , the gorilla gathers the girl in her arms , carrying her off as she would one of her young			0
the bond between the playmates is unmistakable despite the the grainy @entity24 footage being more than 20 years old			0
dressed in navy jumper and light blue trousers , 18 - month - old @entity25 romps in the sunshine , one minute swaying on a rope swing , the next tumbling down the slide , tummy first , her not - so - little friend behind her			1
not - so - little being the operative phrase			2
for @entity25 ’s playground is , in fact , an animal pen at @entity35 in @entity36 and her chums are western lowland gorillas			1
scroll down to see the video of @entity43 and the gorilla for yourself ... controversial parenting ? a photo taken in 1990 , before the video was filmed , shows @entity25 in the arms of an adult gorilla at @entity35 in @entity36 her father , @entity51 , has now decided to release the family film via @entity53 and is making it available on @entity55			1
it is a controversial decision and @entity51 , 52 , is prepared for criticism but remains unrepentant			0
‘ this is a family video , ’ he says			2
‘ before i would n’t have released it but now , with the internet it is different			0
i do n’t care if i get a bit of stick because i think the gorillas get a good deal out of it			2
there ’s an upside for them that there was n’t before			2
if we can show millions of people how gentle and noble and wonderful these animals are , then i think we ’re doing the gorillas a service			1
i ’m happy to take the stick for that			0
’ @entity25 , now 23 , agrees			1
she says : ‘ i obviously understand that people might find it quite shocking seeing a baby going in with the gorillas because that ’s how they have been brought up – to see gorillas in that @entity85 kind of way			1
but really gorillas are such wonderful , gentle animals and they ’re so human - like			1
so i hope it ’s a way of people understanding how gentle and kind gorillas really are			1
’ she was too young to remember the video taken at @entity35 , the @entity95 mansion that her grandfather , the gambler @entity92 , bought after a particularly good night at the tables			1
laughing or crying ? video clip of 18 - month - old @entity25 playing alone with one of @entity101 's gorillas no fear : the toddler was filmed 19 years ago by @entity51 and has been kept secret because of some fears that it might have provoked a backlash from childcare experts because of the risk gorilla - hug : the young girl is smothered by the 300lb powerful adult @entity25 filled the house and grounds with animals , including tigers , wolves and gorillas			1
he also brought the pets he had kept in his previous home in @entity122 ’s @entity121 including a leopard , a @entity125 bear and a capuchin monkey			1
in time , the animals were moved outdoors and @entity35 became a wildlife park			1
on @entity92 ’s death in 2000 , @entity51 took control and set up the @entity131 , a conservation initiative to return captive - bred animals into the wild			1
his foundation has now bred more captive animals – and reintroduced them into the wild – than any other organisation in @entity138			1
there have been 139 gorilla births , 33 black rhinos and 20 african elephants			0
the animals are released into reserves in @entity145 and the @entity146 , where the foundation has approximately a million acres of guarded land			2
contrary to popular belief , this is no rich man ’s hobby			2
true , @entity51 is wealthy thanks to the chain of casinos he set up with media mogul @entity157 ’s son @entity156 – but it is all self - made money			1
his father refused to help him financially , and at the time of his death , @entity35 was running at a loss of millions			1
gorilla - loving father @entity163 , 52 , with his daughter @entity25 ( now 23 ) @entity92 was the owner of @entity35 and grandfather to @entity43 @entity51 has not only ensured its survival but turned it into a truly groundbreaking conservation project			1
@entity25 also wants to play a part in the foundation ’s work – mainly , she says , because of her childhood experiences			1
‘ i do n’t really remember that specific moment with the gorillas but i do remember playing with them , ’ says @entity25 , who has just completed a degree in politics at @entity175 and is ‘ on the job hunt ’			1
‘ i do n’t have any of the fear of gorillas that people normally have			2
i just feel love and warmth			0
of all the animals , gorillas are my favourite			1
and that ’s because they were always something i went in with as a child			2
i remember them being so gentle – they almost treated me as if i was one of their own little babies			0
’ ambam the gorilla shows how he can walk like a human at @entity35 of course , there are dangers			2
during his adolescence @entity201 , @entity203 ’s society club - owning son , was mauled by a tiger at @entity35			1
in 1980 , a tigress called @entity207 was shot after killing two keepers , and in 1994 the park ’s head keeper was killed when a two - year - old @entity212 tiger pounced on him			2
and in 1989 a two - year - old boy had his arm ripped off by a chimp after he reached into a cage to stroke it at another @entity43 park in @entity36 , @entity220			1
there is no record of a gorilla ever killing a human			0
@entity51 says : ‘ i would n’t put my children or daughters in with an adult tiger or a lion regardless of the relationship – but gorillas are different			0
’ even so , times have changed , something @entity51 accepts			0
@entity25 and her younger sister , @entity233 , 20 , are @entity51 ’s daughters with his first wife , @entity235			1
the couple divorced in 1997			0
both girls were allowed to play with the gorillas but @entity239 , his eight - year - old daughter by his former partner , @entity240 , was not			2
he says : ‘ i gave an interview when @entity239 was young and they said , “ would you take @entity239 in with the gorillas ? ” i said , “ yes , sure			0
the police called and said if you do this we ’re going to have to come and interview you and social services called and said , “ we might take your child if you do this			0
” the usual absolute nonsense			0
’ still , he ’s teaching her tiger speak and gorilla gurgles			0
‘ i can speak wild boar , ’ he says			0
‘ when you wake up in the morning , open the bedroom door and two tigers jump in your bed , you ’re in serious trouble if you do n’t know good morning in tiger - speak			2
’ @entity51 ’s earliest memory is of playing roly - poly on the lawn with wolves and rolling over a wasps ’ nest			1
‘ i was about eight and was with my sister , ’ he recalls			0
‘ the swarm came out and they chased us and the wolves , biting and stinging us everywhere			0
‘ one of the animal people grabbed me , my sister and the wolves and shoved us underwater at a trough			0
i remember opening my eyes under the water and a wolf and i just looked at each other terrified			0
my fear was never of the animals – but i ’ve been wary of wasps ever since			0
’ @entity35 is also home to big cats such as these tigers see the video of @entity43 and the gorilla for yourself below			1
@entity163 has put the film on the internet to show the amazing bond that can be formed between gorillas and humans			0
he said : ‘ it ’s a thing of great beauty in my life			0
it ’s a very deep connection and when you know that and see that , you will know what i mean			0
‘ that ’s why i released the video			2
if seeing @entity25 does a little bit more to reinforce the belief that there is a place for gorillas on this planet , then people can say whatever they like			1

18 - month - old @entity25 played with the gorillas in their pen at @entity35 in @entity36
father thinks he is doing gorillas ' a service ' by posting the video online and revealing their gentle *nature*
gambling grandfather bought @entity35 after a big win on the tables
filled it with many other animals including tigers and wolves
