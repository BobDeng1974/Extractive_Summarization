@entity11 militants , who are based in @entity12 , say they will plunge @entity9 into ‘ disaster ’			1
last week @entity14 warned it would open ‘ the gates of evil ’ if the hate cleric was sent back to @entity16 for trial			1
on an internet forum used by militants , @entity11 said : ‘ the @entity9 public is forewarned that it will be the @entity9 government , as a result of its imprudence , that shall be liable for any disaster that befalls them , or their national interests			1
’ the message was discovered by the @entity29 , which monitors online activity from terrorist groups			1
the group also found the @entity14 message that said : ‘ we warn the @entity9 government against extraditing sheikh @entity2 to @entity16			2
’ the terror network called on the government to ‘ act with reason and wisdom ... or it will regret it ’			2
the hate preacher was arrested and hauled before a court on tuesday with home secretary @entity40 saying he would ‘ soon be on a plane and out of the country for good ’			2
the action was ordered because @entity45 lawyers believed the deadline for @entity47 to try to take his case to the @entity50 in @entity51 had passed the night before			2
but in a farcical development it appeared that the deadline had not been missed after all , with court officials indicating that @entity47 ’s lawyers had until tuesday night to lodge papers			0
discovery : @entity29 , which monitors online activity from terrorist groups , said that @entity12 's @entity14 - linked militant group @entity11 also issued a warning on militant forums monday denials : home secretary @entity40 , pictured today , continues to insist there had been no blunder by her officials over @entity47 's case now five judges will have to decide whether to pass the case to the @entity50 , the highest body of the @entity72 court			1
if they find for @entity47 it could undermine the prospects of sending 14 other terrorists home , including one linked to @entity11			1
another , known only as @entity77 , is an @entity78 described in court documents as a ‘ leading organiser and facilitator of terrorist activity overseas ’			1
@entity83 , president of the @entity84 , told @entity85 on thursday : ‘ i take the view that there ’s an @entity89 - standard screw - up somewhere here , whether it ’s with the @entity50 , or it ’s @entity40 or with her officials			0
‘ what i ’m absolutely certain of is that @entity2 should be deported			0
he should be on a plane as soon as possible			0
’ mrs may made no reference to the case yesterday as she attended a workplace diversity conference in central @entity4 organised by gay rights group @entity97			0
but shadow home secretary @entity98 accused her of ‘ taking risks with national security ’ , and said the episode was a ‘ shambles ’			0
‘ the home secretary needs to come clean and explain how this fiasco happened and how she is taking responsibility to put it right , ’ she added			0
@entity107 mp @entity106 has said the saga risks painting the @entity9 as a safe haven for terrorists , while sir @entity111 said it was time the @entity9 ‘ withdrew its legal processes ’ from the @entity72 court			0
