yesterday morning , i jumped on the scales after a six - mile run and was elated to see that i weigh 9 st 13 lb , the first time i 've seen the figure ' 9 ' gracing the electronic scales for some considerable time			2
at 29 , i 'm 4st 7lb lighter than i was eight months ago and have shrunk from a dress size 18 to a ten ... sometimes even an eight			1
my legs , once so chunky i could n't squeeze them into a pair of wellies , are slim and toned , and my flabby arms are now lithe			0
standing at 5 ft 5 in tall , i have a curvaceous waist where several spare tyres used to sit			0
and my husband @entity17 , who 's 32 and an area manager for a car valeting company , thinks i 'm the most gorgeous creature on the planet			1
many people might say @entity17 is a lucky man			1
others might argue he 's lucky to be alive			2
because i have n't been on a faddy diet or joined a slimming club to ditch the weight			0
my new slender figure is the result of some tough love from @entity17 when he told me through the pages of @entity19 magazine that i was fat and needed to shape up			1
but effective ? most definitely			0
for there is nothing like the fear of realising the man you love sees you as an unattractive , whining self - pitying lump to shake you into action			2
oh yes , i 'd raged and wept over @entity17 's ' hurtful ' words , and even slung a few words of my own back in spite and anger , but now i can see it was the greatest gift of love he 's ever given me			1
because @entity17 's searing honesty succeeded where countless diets have failed			1
and i 'd advise any husband , unhappy with his loved one turning to blubber , to take his wife to one side and tell her to take her weight in hand			1
and to all those women who blame their burgeoning weight on ' big bones ' and ' low self - esteem ' , i urge them to take heed from my story			2
take a long look in a mirror			0
if you were a man , would you find that woman attractive ? then why should the husband who married a size 12 goddess be forced to pretend he still thinks you 're gorgeous ? on their wedding day : @entity16 is glad her husband was honest about her weight gain as ' why should the husband who married a size 12 goddess be forced to pretend he still thinks you 're gorgeous ? ' niceness and understanding have never worked with me			1
@entity17 told me ( along with thousands of @entity19 readers ) what i needed to hear , and what every fat woman needs to hear			1
out of respect to him , and my marriage , i listened			0
when we appeared in the @entity19 in june , we braced ourselves			1
and the furore it triggered was huge , with men and women divided over whether such brutal honesty was ever justified within a marriage			0
there were men who believed @entity17 must have a ' death wish ' for uttering the truth , and women declaring they 'd have slapped him and that it was him i should shed , not the excess weight			1
some even accused me of a lack of solidarity with the sisterhood for heeding his words			0
but there were also countless messages of support from readers who recognised that @entity17 's comments were borne out of his concern for my health and happiness , and our relationship			1
of course , initially i was furious with him when he blurted out his appraisal of my body after a shopping trip to @entity126			0
empty - handed because i could n't find any clothes to fit , i was having one of my regular strops about being fat , never expecting @entity17 would agree with me this time			1
bearing in mind he 'd been listening to me moan for the previous five years as i went from a size 12 to a size 18 , it 's hardly surprising that he finally let rip			1
i raged at him for being cruel and insensitive and it was tempting to storm off to the nearest patisserie to spite him			0
but @entity17 stood firm and was determined to be heard			2
' you moan all the time about being fat			2
it 's made you miserable , and it 's making me miserable , so why do n't you stop moaning and do something about it ? ! ' @entity142 : @entity16 has learnt how healthy eating and exercise can transform her health and she now runs regularly ( picture posed by model ) once i 'd calmed down , i had to concede that @entity17 was simply pointing out what was staring me in the ( fat ) face			1
my bum did look big in everything i put on , i was seriously overweight at almost 15 st , my self - esteem had withered			2
our sex life had also waned because i did n't like him seeing or touching my body			0
a week earlier , we 'd been going out for dinner with friends and as i slung on a baggy t - shirt and eschewed make - up , @entity17 had said to me , sadly : ' you never make an effort to dress up like you used to			1
' although i 'd never doubted @entity17 's love for me and had always ignored his words , as i looked in the mirror , i felt vulnerable			1
i could n't take the risk of his head one day being turned by someone slimmer and happier than me			0
i 'd previously lost 2 st with @entity170 , then piled it all back on			2
and a no - carb diet left me ravenous			0
i would also indulge in three or four glasses of wine a night at weekends , adding up to a whopping 2,400 calories , the equivalent of an extra day 's food ! the answer to tackling my weight problem emerged a few weeks later when we visited friends who were getting married and in their best shape ever			2
they were using a computer app which provides reams of advice about healthy eating and allows you to calculate the calories you consume and burn through exercise			0
i downloaded the app onto my phone and we went for a walk to put it to the test			0
when i entered my activity into the app later , i was amazed to see i 'd burned 400 calories			0
it was a revelation and i began power - walking as often as i could , even during lunch breaks from my job as practice manager at a firm of architects			0
i started weighing out cereal for breakfast so that it was a 40 g portion as recommended on the packet , rather than a bowlful that would feed four people - another tip from the app. a normal adult will use up 400 calories running an 11 - and - a - half minute mile or 444 calories cycling a 14 to 16 - minute mile for lunch , i switched to healthy sandwich fillings such as chicken or tuna , and snacked on plain popcorn , fruit and yogurt			1
in the evenings , i swapped pasta and rice for sweet potatoes , bulgar wheat and couscous			0
and i ditched wine for gin and slimline tonic , which contains fewer than 100 calories per glass			0
a stone fell off in under five weeks and i started running , too - a few miles at first , but now i run six miles , four or five times a week			1
by the time we were photographed for the @entity19 in june , i 'd lost 2 st and dared to wear a fitted dress to @entity17 's brother 's wedding			1
other guests complimented me on my weight loss and confidence			0
seeing my photo in the @entity19 and the reader comments spurred me on further			2
by the first week in october , i 'd lost 4 st and have lost another 7 lb since			0
far from sitting back and smugly eating chips and chocolate , @entity17 joined me in my quest and has now lost almost 3 st himself â€” the difference is that i never thought of him as fat and he never complained about his body			1
in my head , i 'm still the fat girl i was back in february			0
research has shown that when you lose weight , your mind takes longer to catch up			0
but the evidence is there in the form of a whole new wardrobe of size 10 clothes , including bikinis for a holiday in @entity267			2
there 's nobody more complimentary about my transformation than @entity271 last friday night i dashed in from work and was about to get changed to go out when he hugged me and declared : ' you look gorgeous just as you are ! ' and our sex life is utterly revitalised			0
so , if you 're tempted to knock @entity17 's honesty , please do n't , because it 's had a magical effect on my figure , health and happiness			1
but for his harsh words , i 'd have been bursting out of size 18 clothes by now , and poor @entity17 would have been running for the door .			1

@entity288 , 29 , and her husband @entity17 appeared in @entity19 in june
he admitted he thought his wife needed to shape up
said she should do something instead of moaning about being fat
she was angry and hurt at first but is now *grateful*
wake - up call she needed to change her *lifestyle*
started dieting and took up running
she 's lost 4st 7lb and dropped from dress size 18 to 10
