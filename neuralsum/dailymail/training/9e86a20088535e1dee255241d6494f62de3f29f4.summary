@entity0 today launched its first ever extraterrestrial landing craft into orbit in the hopes it will become the first country in almost 40 years to soft - land a probe on the moon			1
the nation is only the third in history to launch an unmanned lunar probe after the @entity11 device , nicknamed ' @entity12 ' after a @entity0 folklore character , set off at 5.30pm on sunday evening ( 1.30am local time )			1
the lunar probe blasted off on board an enhanced @entity18 carrier rocket from the @entity19 in @entity0 's southwestern @entity21 province			1
the mission is a huge step forward for its ambitious space programme and forms part of a plan in which @entity0 hopes to build a permanent lunar base in order to launch future missions to @entity53 within the next 15 years			1
president @entity54 has said he wants @entity0 to establish itself as a space superpower , and the mission has inspired widespread pride in @entity0 's growing technological prowess			2
state television showed a live broadcast of the rocket lifting off			0
if all goes smoothly , the rover will conduct geological surveys and search for natural resources after the probe touches down on the moon in mid-december			0
it is designed to roam the lunar surface for at least 90 @entity68 days – three @entity69 days – covering an area of about five square kilometres			1
plan : the probe launch is a major step for @entity0 's ambitious space programme which includes building a permanent lunar base record - breaker : the probe will be the country 's first to land on the moon and has been nicknamed ' @entity12 ' it will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking high - resolution images of the rock , a flat area formed from the molten basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago			1
the journey of the probe and its final landing will be closely monitored by the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , which is cooperating closely with @entity0			2
@entity90 ’s own launch station in @entity92 , @entity93 , will immediately start receiving signals from the mission after take - off and it will upload commands to the probe on behalf of the @entity0 control centre			2
' @entity99 for human or robotic missions , international cooperation like this is necessary for the future exploration of planets , moons and asteroids , benefitting everyone , ' said @entity107 , director of @entity90 ’s human spaceflight operations			0
this will be @entity0 's first spacecraft to make a soft landing beyond @entity68			0
in recent years , @entity0 has made considerable progress in its space programme			2
history : @entity0 will become just the third country in history to soft land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon when ' @entity12 ' launches next @entity122 gold - coloured model has six wheels and wing - like solar panels @entity0 scientists test the moon rover ahead of its launch			1
the six - wheeled @entity12 vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years in june , three @entity0 astronauts spent 15 days in orbit and docked their craft with an experimental space laboratory			1
in 2007 , the country despatched an unmanned spacecraft called @entity137 to orbit the @entity69			0
the craft stayed in space for 16 months before being intentionally crashed on to the @entity69 's surface			0
the name @entity12 was chosen after an online poll in which millions took part			2
@entity145 , head of the moon rover project , told @entity147 earlier this week that the ancient beliefs had their origins in the marks left by impacts on the lunar landscape			0
' there are several black spots on the moon 's surface			0
our ancient people imagined they were a moon palace , osmanthus trees , and a jade rabbit , ' he said			0
@entity0 sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 , becoming the third country after @entity165 and the @entity166 to achieve manned space travel independently			1
the military - backed space programme is a source of national pride			0
@entity0 is one of only three countries to have managed to independently send humans into space , the others being @entity165 and the @entity166			1
form : the first time @entity0 launched an unmanned spacecraft was in 1999 , pictured			2
it is the only the third country to have done so , after @entity165 and the @entity166 @entity179 astronaut @entity178 , right , walking on the moon , left , in 1969			0

@entity182 today launched the first unmanned lunar probe since 1976
it has been nicknamed @entity12 in *honour* of @entity0 folklore character
the probe will roam the lunar surface for up to 90 days
@entity0 says it wants to create a permanent lunar base within 15 years
ambition is part of plan to move ahead of the @entity166 and become leading space explorer in the world
