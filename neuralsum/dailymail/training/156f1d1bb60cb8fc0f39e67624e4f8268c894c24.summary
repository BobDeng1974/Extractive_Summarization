by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:40 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 03:16 est , 25 september 2012 @entity4 ’s wife @entity3 risked upstaging her husband on the third day of the @entity7 conference			1
everywhere the deputy prime minister went yesterday people seemed more interested in his wife than his latest pronouncements on tax and spending , including at a q&a session where photographers and most eyes in the room appeared fixed on the successful lawyer - not her husband			0
in fact it had been the couple 's 12th wedding anniversary , but instead of a night away or a romantic meal cooked by the @entity24 , lucky @entity3 was spending it with @entity7 politicians and delegates at the party 's celebrated ' welsh night ' in @entity29			1
and to make it worse @entity32 host @entity31 ended an interview on live television by remarking on @entity3 ’s appearance , to the obvious discomfort of the deputy prime minister			2
@entity38 was in the audience yesterday for her husband 's q&a session , but has now returned to @entity42 the @entity43 yesterday celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary in @entity29 ‘ congratulations on your long lasting marriage			1
may i just say you have a very attractive wife , ’ mr @entity31 said as mr @entity4 squirmed , replying : ' i think she will be very flattered by that			1
' carrying on regardless mr @entity31 then said : ' i think he blushed at that , ' and the @entity24 tried to end the conversation by saying simply : ' yes '			2
after mr @entity4 was off screen the presenter continued the conversation with his colleague			0
' she is on the front page of the @entity60 , a very good picture - very good			0
' viewers were surprised by the question , after a long discussion about mr @entity4 's tax plans and tuition fees apology			0
a source close to mr @entity4 said he was unfazed by the comment , but added : ' it was not your traditional question for an early morning tour of the tv studios			0
’ but mr @entity31 was n't the only man with his mind on @entity3			2
in his monday newspaper column @entity76 hailed her as one of the 20 reasons to defend mr @entity4 - in a piece entitled ' we 've got to save the @entity82			1
ranking her as reason number eight , he declared : ‘ @entity38 , is every bit as lovely and clever and funny as she appears			0
' awkward moment : @entity4 was live on @entity32 when host @entity31 told him he had a ' very attractive wife ' do n't be glum : @entity4 is now on his own in @entity29 after @entity3 returned to @entity42 without a major appearance in the conference hall , mr @entity4 had instead been wracking up photo opportunities – though without @entity3 by his side			1
she had returned to @entity42 to look after the couple ’s three children			0
touring the trade stands in the @entity29 conference centre , he had a go at a steady hand game – successfully completing the buzzer toy run by the @entity99			0
he later posed to have his picture taken on the @entity102 stand			0
winning face : the @entity7 leader concentrates hard on a steady hand game say cheese : @entity4 poses in front of a picture of @entity109 earlier on a visit to an engineering firm in @entity29 with @entity112 , mr @entity4 brushed aside the support of the @entity42 mayor who used his @entity60 column to set out 20 reasons why everyone , and not just conservatives , should be grateful help mr @entity4 to survive			1
mr @entity76 said the @entity7 had ‘ laid down his political life ’ to form a government , even if that meant being attacked from all sides and suffering a ‘ protracted political humiliation ’			2
the @entity42 mayor declared : ‘ never mind the badgers – save the @entity82 from extermination ! ’ bring me sunshine : @entity112 and @entity4 today visited the @entity129 in @entity130 where the @entity131 brushed aside the backing of @entity76 but mr @entity4 insisted he would not be taking tips from mr @entity76 : ‘ @entity76 is the nation 's greatest celebrity politician and he is much held aloft by the people of @entity42			1
‘ he is an extremely amusing writer but i do n't think i will be taking my guide from @entity76 about my own future			2

everywhere the @entity7 leader went he was dogged by questions about his wife
@entity32 presenter @entity31 risked *incurring* the @entity131 's wrath by commenting on his wife 's looks
' may i just say you have a very attractive wife , ’ he said as the *dpm* squirmed
@entity76 listed her as the eighth most *important* reason to ' save the @entity82 '
the couple celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary at the @entity7 ' @entity157 night '
