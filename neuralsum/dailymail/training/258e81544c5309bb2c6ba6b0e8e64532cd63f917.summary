by @entity0 published : 02:14 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 19 june 2013 a judge described a graffiti gang who caused £ 150,000 worth of damage in planned attacks on trains as ' talented artists ' , as he locked them up for a combined total of almost four years			1
@entity9 , 21 , @entity10 , 22 , and @entity11 , 17 , targeted train and tube carriages across @entity14 in a three - year campaign described as vandalism on ' an industrial scale '			1
the trio , who called themselves ' smt ' , caused huge disruption to train services by spraying their tag onto carriages under cover of darkness			2
but judge @entity28 said the defendants had ' got talent ' , and that he would pass the ' least possible ' sentence			1
@entity9 , 21 , of @entity32 @entity11 , 17 , of @entity33 @entity10 , 22 , of @entity34 after vandalising trains the gang members would brag about the damage they had caused by posting pictures and videos of their handiwork online , @entity35 was told			1
prosecutor @entity43 said @entity9 even had a map of the capital 's rail network in his bedroom pin - pointing the raids , with the words ' you need all this and more ' written above it			1
' this was a planned and prolonged campaign of damage to property of an almost industrial scale , and caused considerable cost and disruption to @entity60 and national rail services , ' he said			1
' it 's not simply tagging with marker pens			0
the scale we are talking about is the entire carriage being daubed			0
' the aim is obviously to get kudos amongst the graffiti community , ' mr @entity43 added			0
the trio were caught after @entity71 officers launched an investigation to try and stop a huge increase in graffiti with the @entity20 tag			1
they were caught three times carrying paint , face masks and gloves between january and june at stations in @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 before they were remanded in custody			0
examining a dossier of @entity10 's work , judge @entity28 said that , while he understood public frustration at the damage caused by the vandals , he did not want to jail them			1
he said : ' i will pass the least possible sentence			2
these are young men and people care about them			0
judge @entity28 : the judge said that while he did not condone the defendants ' actions , he understood the ' adrenaline rush ' it gave them ' i do n't endorse it but i understand the adrenaline rush and the feeling it gives them and they may be isolated in their families			1
' i do n't want to be doing this and i will by as lenient as i can be			0
they 've got talent and some of mr @entity10 's portfolio you would be proud of			2
' clearly they are talented artists , ' the judge added			0
but judge @entity28 said the least possible sentence would still mean prison for the trio , who all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit criminal damage			1
he said : ' this is a course of conduct which is all too prevalent in our society as well as abroad and is dealt with by people who no doubt have talent			0
' sadly it 's often young men who in other areas of their lives feel isolated or inadequate			0
' taking trains out of service affects people who are trying to live their ordinary lives , disrupting them in ways you probably do n't understand			0
' it 's often said by those who carry it out that this is a victimless crime but it is not			0
' it 's all very unfortunate because you are young men and it 's a waste of your lives			0
' @entity9 , of @entity33 , north west @entity14 , was sentenced to two years in prison			1
@entity10 , of @entity146 , @entity34 , @entity147 , was handed nine months in prison			2
