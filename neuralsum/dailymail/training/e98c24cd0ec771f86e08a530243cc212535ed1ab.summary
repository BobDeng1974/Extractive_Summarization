@entity1 supporters flew their ' come home ronaldo ' banner over @entity6 ’s @entity5 stadium but the @entity8 striker only had eyes for goal as he scored his 10th league goal of the season in a 2 - 0 win			1
@entity14 is the first player to reach double figures inside the first six weeks of the season in the last 60 years of @entity16			0
with 187 league goals for @entity8 he also enters their top 10 league scorers list in just five seasons at the club			0
it was as the biplane circled over-head with that message for @entity14 that the @entity25 striker got @entity8 ’s second goals			2
@entity14 netted his 11th goal in his last six games for @entity8 at the @entity29 @entity25 international @entity14 netted in the 40th minute to double his side 's lead @entity14 is all smiles as the @entity8 as he receives a hug from @entity34 and @entity35 a plane carrying a ' come home ronaldo ' banner flies overhead as @entity14 scored for @entity8 and it was the killer blow to break @entity6 ’s resolve			1
@entity40 had scored the first on 32 minutes with a shot from outside the area but the home side had plenty of chances to still be in the contest until @entity14 grabbed the second from a fine counter-attacking run and pass from @entity34			1
@entity50 saved a @entity51 shot and @entity52 blazed the rebound embarrassingly over with the goal gaping			2
the offside flag had been raised but the @entity57 striker had not seen it and it was a miss that summed up @entity6 ’s first half			0
young @entity63 striker @entity62 was always a threat but he just could n’t find a finish as @entity6 played passes around @entity8 ’s defence but lacked the lethal penetration that the visitors showed at the other end			0
@entity8 had come into the game on a run of scoring 18 goals in three games and they had @entity35 up against @entity76 @entity75 playing out of position at left back because of the absence of @entity79 and @entity80			1
@entity40 scored his first league goal of the season against @entity84 outfit @entity85 @entity8 full backs @entity86 and @entity87 were the first to congratulate midfielder @entity40 @entity14 and @entity40 celebrate as @entity8 beat @entity6 2 - 0 away from home the game marked the former @entity92 man ’s return to the scene of his debut 377 days before			1
@entity75 blasted over with the first attack of the second half and when former @entity98 youth - teamer @entity97 came on he tested @entity50 with a long shot from distance but there was no way through for @entity6 even with the introduction of @entity104			2
the talented @entity107 left winger is on loan from @entity8 and they would have had to pay 250,000 euros to name him against his parent club			0
that did n’t help their cause going forward and they had been made to pay for their lack of a finisher			0
@entity8 have theirs , and his relentless march up the club ’s all - time scorers table just goes on and on			0
@entity35 could n't add one of his own against @entity6 but @entity8 won nonetheless on saturday @entity8 beat @entity6 2 - 0 on saturday and were able to keep themselves towards the top end of @entity16			1

@entity40 opens scoring before @entity14 doubles @entity8 's lead
a plane carrying a ' come home ronaldo ' banner by @entity1 fans flies above @entity5
@entity14 scored three against @entity129 in 8 - 2 win last saturday , and four against @entity131 in 5 - 1 *victory* on *tuesday* *previously*
