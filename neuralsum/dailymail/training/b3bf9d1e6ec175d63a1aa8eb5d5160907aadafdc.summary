by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 19:15 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 06:26 est , 6 march 2014 the @entity4 fan which is the ' near silent ' update to its bladeless fan that it claims is quieter than a buzzing mosquito @entity9 experts have launched a new bladeless fan that is 75per cent quieter and eliminates the tone that equates to the irritating mosquito hum. however the sound of silence does not come cheaply , for the designer fan ranges in price from £ 219.99 to £ 299.99 depending on the size and style			1
the company has spent some £ 40million on developing its @entity4 bladeless fans , which come from laboratories that employ 1,500 scientists and engineers			2
the new design @entity26 fans includes an innovation called a @entity29 cavity , which effectively dissipates some of the sound waves caused by the fan			0
the engineers identified which tone was the most irritating to the human ear , which is equivalent to a mosquito ’s beating wind , and have managed to kill this			0
they have also smoothed the airflow through the fan , which reduces turbulence and so further reduces noise			1
the combined effect of the changes has also made the fans some 40per cent more energy efficient , so reducing the running costs			0
the design has been called an ' innovation ' that helps to dissipate sound waves , and smoother airflow also helps the fan in noise reduction			2

@entity9 spent £ 40 million on developing the bladeless fan
the device will cost around £ 219.99 to £ 299.99 depending on size and style
device reduces noise with new *technology* with smoother airflow
