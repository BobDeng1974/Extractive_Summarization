@entity0 are flying high in the @entity1 , second only to the mighty @entity2 with 11 games played , but it has n't always been that way			1
here , @entity6 's @entity5 charts his memories of a slightly different @entity0 team - one which resorted to selling cheap tickets to students in a bid to fill @entity12 in @entity13 ... it is saturday , december 11 , 2010 and i ’m in @entity0 , spending the last scraps of my student loan on snakebites , settling in to watching a day of @entity1 football on the tv in a not particularly nice , but warm pub. in stroll a couple of friends , they each have scores of tickets for a @entity0 match happening that afternoon , just down the road at @entity12			1
they 're tasked with flogging them to their fellow students at discounted rates			0
@entity35 holds off @entity37 's @entity36 during a @entity13 clash at @entity12 back in 2010 @entity39 , now of @entity40 and @entity41 , in action for the @entity44 club more than four years ago it was n’t exactly a glamour tie - a @entity13 scrap between @entity0 and @entity48 - but such was the desperation to fill the stands , tickets were going on sale to students for as little as £ 3			1
bargain ! so , me and a few friends wobbled our way to @entity12 ’s and sat ourselves down for what seemed like a first half that lasted for all of eternity			0
murmurs of despondency and roars of frustration poured from the crowd which was at least 10,000 shy of capacity			0
@entity70 scores the opening goal as he curls his left - footed shot past @entity74 keeper @entity73 @entity75 international @entity70 scored a double in @entity0 's 2 - 0 win over @entity74 on saturday there was a full house at the @entity12 for the visit of last year 's @entity82 winners @entity74 we watched on as @entity0 played football only comparable in lack of quality to my @entity88 hoody , one of the few things that cost less than my ticket			1
by half - time , @entity48 were 2 - 0 up			0
freezing cold , bored rigid and surrounded by disillusioned @entity0 fans , me and my mates looked at each other , sheepishly rose from our seats and bumbled back to the relative safety and comfort of the nearby pub. on the short walk , i remember thinking to myself , " there ’s no way i ’m paying £ 3 to watch that s * * * e again ! "			2
it ’s hard to believe that just four years on , the same club are riding high , second in the @entity1 and battling away for a place in @entity109			2
they ’re not only filling the stands at @entity12 but pleasing the crowd with emphatic victories and a brand of football that ’s being recognised – and very much enjoyed – by the masses .			0

@entity0 are second in the @entity1 after 11 matches
the @entity0 were *tipped* by many for *relegation* after *losing* a host of players
but now they 're *top* - four *contenders* and are @entity2 's nearest *challengers*
