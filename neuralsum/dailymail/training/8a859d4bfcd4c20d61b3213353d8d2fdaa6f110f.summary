a former @entity1 soloist , who had to quit her promising career as a dancer after a thyroid illness caused her to gain 40lbs , has broken her silence			1
@entity6 , now 25 and based in @entity7 , was only 17 when she joined the prestigious @entity1 and was 21 when she was diagnosed with an under - active thyroid			1
at 23 when she quit in order to recover			2
' you have to be thin , you have to look good , you have to fit in the costume , and that ’s pretty much it , ' she told @entity14			0
' it 's just part of the job			0
dancing ten hours a day and juggling the industry standard of 50 ballet shows per season became impossible amid the crippling migraines , exhaustion , hair loss and weight gain			1
' i remember [ my ballet masters ] just constantly telling me , " you 're gaining weight ; you 're gaining weight ; you 're gaining weight			2
" and i just thought , " yes , i know " , ' she recalls , referring to the time just before her diagnoses , when the weight gain was unexplained			2
on the mend : miss @entity6 , pictured in 2010 when she was playing the lead role of @entity25 in @entity26 ( left ) and now , two years after she had to quit following her under - active thyroid diagnoses ( right ) miss @entity6 is keen to maintain that it were her choice to break her contract and head to her hometown of @entity50 , @entity51 , to recover ; and that the @entity1 's concerns over her weight were purely logistical			1
she describes ballet as an ' aesthetic art ' with a certain standard that audience members pay to enjoy			2
that , and the simple fact that the male dancers ' need to be able to lift you , ' renders your weight important			0
' when i was heavier , i found that things just hurt more , ' she admits			0
' @entity67 hurt a lot more , and it was really hard to do some of the things that i did when i was thinner at a heavier weight			0
' her difficult decision to leave her fledgling career was probably wise			0
miss @entity6 spent the next two years recovering in @entity51 , where she started a blog , if the @entity76 , and a @entity78 channel for other aspiring dancers			2
giving guidance and advice to others was , and still is , a therapeutic practice for @entity84 , who describes it as ' catering to my 13 - year - old self			0
' grueling : miss @entity6 ( pictured in 2010 ) trained for ten hours daily at the @entity1 , and describes it as an ' aesthetic art ' with a certain standard that audience members pay to enjoy turned teacher : miss @entity6 left the @entity1 in 2012 at the age of 23 to recover from her illness at home			1
there she started a blog and @entity78 channel ( pictured ) to give guidance to other aspiring dancers questions she receives from young , ambitious girls regarding the importance of weight and general appearance are tough , but miss @entity6 claims she never lies			1
it would n't be helpful , she points out , to paint an unattainable fantasy , because it is an industry , much like modelling , where weight will always be a concern			0
' you 're looking at yourself in the mirror every single day in a leotard , ' she remarks			0
' i tell people who are not dancers that it 's like being in a bathing suit all day long			0
' miss @entity6 notes that during her time at the highly competitive @entity1 , she was n't exposed directly to eating disorders			1
in all likelihood however , many girls were ' probably very good at hiding it			0
' she does argue that the intense physical demands of the job are enough to keep dancers slender in of itself , and that it would be impossible to ' not eat ' and still manage to perform at such a level			0
miss @entity6 ( pictured in may ) is now recovered , has dropped 25lbs , and plans to return to ballet miss @entity6 , who stills runs her popular blog and @entity78 channel , was given a clean bill of health in may of this year , and is keen to pick up where she left off			1
the first step , she says , it to ' get in shape ' again - she 's dropped 25lbs so far - and then she will start auditioning for ballet companies			1
she was unable to rejoin the @entity1 , so will have to explore other options			2
in a statement made to the @entity145 last month , @entity140 , the company ’s ballet master in chief , said : ' [ miss @entity6 's ] decision to leave @entity1 was an enormous loss , but was , of course , necessary so that she could focus on her health			1
' when @entity150 reached out to me in the spring of 2013 about possibly returning to the stage , i was thrilled to hear that she was feeling better			0
' however , at the time @entity1 was working very hard to eliminate several years of budget deficits , and i was simply unable to add another dancer to the roster , and could not offer @entity150 a position with the company			2
' despite this set - back , taking a break from the occupation that had dominated her life - ' if you 're more concerned with having friends , this may not be the career for you , ' she advises in one video - has actually been a positive learning experience for miss @entity6			1
with her health back , a legion of over 9,000 subscribers to her @entity78 channel , and dreams of ending up at a ballet company in @entity175 , miss @entity6 's future looks to be bright again .			1

@entity6 , now 25 , was diagnosed with an under - active thyroid in 2010 , causing weight gain , exhaustion and hair loss
she quit the @entity1 in 2012 to recover and has since lost 25lbs
now healthy , miss @entity6 is auditioning for ballet companies again
