by @entity0 @entity2 captain @entity1 believes @entity3 is on course to dominate golf following the @entity8 champion 's victory in the @entity9 on sunday			1
a fortnight after holding off @entity10 to lift the @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity3 overhauled his @entity2 team - mate to claim his first @entity15 event and regain top spot in the world rankings			1
@entity3 turned a three - shot deficit into a two - shot lead within the space of five holes at @entity21 before @entity10 battled back to leave the pair tied heading into the back nine			2
champion : mcilroy with his trophy after winning the @entity9 at @entity21 @entity10 had played the same stretch of holes in just 27 shots in his second round of 61 , but it was @entity3 who came out on top two days later in a tense duel , the 25 - year - old carding a closing 66 to finish 15 under par , two ahead of @entity10 as he had been in the @entity8			1
with @entity36 finishing outside the top five , that meant @entity3 reclaimed the world number one spot he last held in march 2013 , just in time for the final major of the year , this week 's @entity40 at @entity41			1
asked if @entity3 was on the way to dominating the sport as @entity44 had , @entity1 told @entity45 : ' there is no reason why not			2
that 's the best exhibition of driving i have ever seen from anybody in terms of length and accuracy			0
that golf course is very narrow off the tee and he is finding the fairway time after time at 340 yards			0
duel : @entity3 and @entity2 team - mate @entity10 finished first and second at the @entity8 and at the @entity15 form : the @entity60 said he was proud to follow up his @entity8 victory with a similar performance ' what i think is great is that @entity3 can hold his attitude where it is at now , it 's very much in the present , taking one week at a time			1
he 's never said he was chasing @entity71 ' record of 18 majors and that 's a great attitude , it takes the pressure off him and keeps him very much in the present where he needs to be			0
' atfer 16 birdies in the first three rounds @entity10 could only manage one in a disappointing closing 71 , meaning the 34 - year - old has now won just three times after holding the 54 - hole lead on 16 occasions			0
' what i am really proud of this week is following on from the @entity8 with a performance like this , ' @entity3 , only the second @entity84 winner of the title after @entity86 in 2003 , told @entity91			2
' i said straight after i did not want any let down , i wanted to keep going and performing until the end of the season			0
' it 's great to come to one of my favourite tournaments of the year and to perform like this i am pretty satisfied			0
' no 1 : after victories at the @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity3 is now top of the world rankings			1
