a @entity1 man believes that a hairless , dog - like animal he shot on his property is n't a dog at all - according to @entity5 , the animal he killed is the legendary @entity7 , a ferocious creature that most animal experts agree is a nothing more than an urban legend			1
mr. @entity5 was ' coon hunting ' at his home in @entity14 when he first was confronted by the four - legged beast			1
at first , he thought the animal was a raccoon , or coyote - his neighbor reported that the animal already had killed three of his chickens			2
his opinion quickly changed when - according to mr. @entity5 - he noticed that the animal had glowing red eyes and that it appeared aggressive			2
he was down like a cat , ' @entity5 told @entity36			0
' when i was standing right yonder , he hit right here			0
and i was seeing the teeth and red eyes			0
it looked like he was going to jump down there and i did n't give him the chance			0
' mr. @entity5 shot the animal with a .22 - calibur rifle			1
he then shot it again to make sure he 'd killed it			0
the animal , mr. @entity5 noticed , is nearly hairless and has nails much longer than a dog 's			1
he 's convinced the animal is a @entity7			1
' my dog , even when it ’s dead , my dog ’s been scared of it , ' mr. @entity5 says of the animal			2
@entity7 translates from @entity57 to ' goat - sucker , ' in reference to the legendary animal 's affinity for sucking the blood of live animals , particularly domesticated goats			1
the legend of the chupacabra date back to 1995 in @entity67 , where many local farmers claimed to have seen the animal after finding their livestock had been killed			1
myth : this illustration shows how the @entity7 is depicted in modern mythology claws : @entity32 insists that the animal 's claws are much longer than that of a dog or coyote sightings of the animal have been reported throughout @entity82 and much of the @entity83 , particularly in the @entity84 , where it is usually determined that suspected @entity7 are just emaciated , sickly coyotes			1
the description of the @entity7 varies , but typically those who claim to see the animal describe it as being about the size of a small bear , with a row of spines along its back			1
in 2004 , a rancher near @entity97 killed a supposed chupacabra that he claimed had been killing his livestock			2
dna from the animal later revealed that it was a coyote with demodectic or sarcoptic mange			0
fangs : @entity5 insists that the animal 's teeth are also indicative of a @entity7 in nearly a dozen other cases where the suspected @entity7 's body has been discovered , dna testing showed that the animal was some sort of wild canine with severe skin disorders , particularly mange			2
@entity5 - who is defiant in his belief that the animal he killed is in fact a @entity7 - has disposed of much of the animal			1
however , he says he 's saved some of the animal for science			0
' @entity121 called up wanting a sample , ' he told the @entity123			0
' i saved a jawbone with teeth , and cut off the ears and toenails			0
that 's all i could stomach			0
