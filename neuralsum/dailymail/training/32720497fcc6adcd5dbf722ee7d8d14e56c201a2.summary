an unarmed 60 - year - old @entity1 man has been shot twice in his own driveway by deputies who mistook him for a car thief			1
for the past month , @entity5 , of @entity6 , says he has been living in perpetual pain and struggling to sleep , haunted by the events of the night when he was shot			2
at around 2.30am on july 27 , @entity5 went to retrieve a loose cigarette from his mother 's @entity12 in the driveway on @entity15 when he was spotted by a neighbor			1
believing that a car break - in was in progress , the resident called 911			2
within minutes , officers @entity44 , sgt. @entity45 and @entity46 arrived on the scene			0
@entity44 and @entity45 ordered the 60 - year - old man to show his hands , and when @entity5 allegedly hesitated and made what was described as a lunging motion , they unleashed a barrage of 15 bullets , two of them striking the man in the legs			1
the officers and their superior , sheriff @entity59 , have maintained that the use of force in this case was proper because @entity5 did not immediately comply with their orders and appeared to reach for a metal object			1
the victim , however , claimed that he was raising his hands when the deputies fired on him instead of asking for his identification or simply inquiring him if he lives there			0
@entity5 added that the object that put the officers on edge was nothing more than a key chain with a flashlight given to him as a present by his daughter , who is serving in @entity77			1

now , he says he can not even sit on the couch without pain			0
the man was released from @entity107 late last month and is expected to begin physical therapy next week			0
defiant : @entity109 @entity59 has sided with his deputies , saying that the use of force against @entity5 was appropriate because he had failed to immediately comply with their orders ‘ i ask myself why they shot me first			2
and why they shoot me so many times afterwards			0
yeah , i ask why -- that 's all i can ask is why , ’ he told @entity115 in his first public interview			0
sheriff @entity59 sided with his officers and sounded a defiant note amid the firestorm that has erupted in the media since the incident last month			0
‘ there was nothing glaringly apparent to us that the officers did that was out of the ordinary in the given set of circumstances as have been given to us , ’ @entity59 said in an interview with @entity115			0
the deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation that will determine whether any charges will be filed against them			0
