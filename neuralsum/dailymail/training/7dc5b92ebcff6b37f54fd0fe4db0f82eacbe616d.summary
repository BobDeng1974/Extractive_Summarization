by @entity0 published : 00:32 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 03:57 est , 4 march 2014 climbers wanting to scale @entity3 will be forced to bring back eight kilograms of rubbish in a bid to clean - up the world 's highest peak			1
the rule , one of several new measures covering mountaineering in the @entity13 nation , will apply to climbers ascending beyond @entity3 's base camp from april onwards , said tourism ministry official @entity16			1
decades of mountaineering has taken its toll on @entity3 which is strewn with rubbish from past expeditions , including oxygen cylinders , human waste and even climbers ' bodies , which do not decompose in the extreme cold			1
a @entity27 man collecting rubbish left by climbers , at an altitude of 8,000 metres during a clean - up expedition at @entity3 mr @entity16 , who is joint secretary at the ministry , said authorities would take legal action against climbers who failed to comply with the new rule , although it was unclear whether this would involve a fine or the confiscation of their mandatory deposit			2
' the government has decided in order to clean up @entity3 that each member of an expedition must bring back at least eight kilos of garbage , apart from their own trash ' , he said			0
last month @entity27 slashed fees for individual climbers on the famed mountain and other @entity13 peaks to attract more mountaineers , sparking concerns of increased traffic and more rubbish			2
@entity3 , scaled for the first time by @entity58 and @entity59 in 1953 , is a key revenue - earner for the country , with hundreds heading there every year during the peak climbing season in april and may			2
under the new rules @entity3 expeditions will have to take their trash to an office which will be set up next month at base camp			1
tip : a group ascending the mountain with the aim of clearing up all of the rubbish left at @entity3 the office will also offer medical aid and resolve conflicts , with soldiers and police on duty to avoid a repeat of the brawl between @entity84 climbers and local guides last year which shocked the mountaineering community			1
@entity87 , expedition manager at @entity88 which organises an annual clean - up tour to @entity3 , said the proposal was ' an encouraging measure to try and keep the mountain clean '			0
the @entity92 has collected some 15 tonnes of garbage , 600 kg of human waste and six bodies since 2008			1
he said local sherpa guides could collect and deliver trash to base camp instead of returning empty - handed from acclimatisation ascents to set up tents for foreign climbers on the mountain			1
dump : rubbish hidden along the @entity3 trail , just beyond the tourists ' line of sight ' ultimately , the success of the regulation will depend on how strictly officials monitor its progress , ' he said			0
although expeditions currently have to fork out a $ 4,000 deposit , refunded once they show they have brought back everything they took up the mountain , enforcement has been a problem			0
' our earlier efforts have not been very effective			0
this time , if climbers do n't bring back garbage , we will take legal action and penalise them , ' tourism official @entity16 said			0
the government is also considering plans to build toilets at base camp , where the shifting ice means structures are at risk of falling down			2
in an overhaul of security on the mountain , soldiers and police will be stationed at the new office at base camp so climbers can approach them with any problems , officials said last month			1
environmental and climbing groups have long sought to focus attention on the mess left behind by expeditions while clean - up projects have also been organised			0
