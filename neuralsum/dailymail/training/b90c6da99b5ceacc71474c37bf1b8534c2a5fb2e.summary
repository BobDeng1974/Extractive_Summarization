criticism : @entity2 's top diplomat @entity1 has been skewered by a report which says she has failed to advance @entity5 influence in her post labour peer and top @entity5 diplomat @entity1 was branded a ‘ national embarrassment ’ last night after her work was condemned by @entity9 – even as she demanded an inflation - busting increase in her department budget			1
the peer came under fire from the @entity16 which said her department , the @entity17 , was indecisive and unresponsive to crises			1
in a hard - hitting report , @entity9 on the foreign affairs committee said the @entity17 – which they want to behave like an @entity5 foreign office – is ‘ top heavy ’ , has ‘ too many decision - making layers ’ and has been slow to respond to situations such as the @entity24 and the conflict in @entity26			1
yet @entity1 , 57 , who became @entity29 of the @entity5 for foreign affairs and security policy when the post was created in 2009 , is now demanding a budget increase of £ 18million for 2014 – a 4 per cent boost at twice the rate of inflation			1
that will take the annual cost of the @entity17 to £ 451million			2
@entity1 , who earns £ 287,543 a year , has faced repeated criticism for coming across as a political lightweight and for failing to offer comment on the financial crisis gripping the @entity5			1
she will be replaced next year and will enjoy a £ 400,000 payoff over the following three years from @entity2 taxpayers			2
@entity46 mp @entity45 said : ‘ for the first time in as long as i can remember , someone in the @entity16 has said something sensible			2
‘ she is a national embarrassment			0
the organisation she heads is monumentally useless			0
it is absurd that it should be asking for more money			0
affairs : @entity1 , right , and chief executive of @entity59 @entity57 talk prior a @entity60 ( @entity61 ) yesterday ‘ there are many public services which have n’t had anything like a 4 per cent increase in budget for years			1
’ fellow @entity46 @entity68 added : ‘ i do n’t know what planet some people in @entity70 live on			0
‘ what we want from a leader in @entity2 is someone who wants to save money and control their budgets			0
to be condemned by the @entity16 takes some doing , but it is a wake - up call for her			0
’ a recent report by the @entity16 ’s budgetary control committee attacked the @entity17 for being ‘ top - heavy ’ with highly paid officials and incompetent staff in its 141 embassies or delegations across the world			2
request : when the @entity24 broke out , @entity89 had to be asked several times before she finally flew to @entity91 the report said : ' even with an ongoing crisis brewing in @entity26 , it was @entity95 that ultimately intervened to keep the country from falling completely to @entity98 fundamentalists ' the foreign affairs committee report adds : ‘ it has become apparent that the @entity5 is unable to ensure , in the short term , a reallocation of resources to match new political priorities			1
’ @entity46 mep @entity104 said : ‘ staff are paid too much to do too little and seem to expect the very best in accommodation all over the world			0
since much of their work duplicates what member state diplomatic missions have been doing for years , the value has to be questionable			0
’ the government has described budget demands by @entity1 as ‘ ludicrous ’ at a time when governments have acted to restrict rises in the overall @entity5 budget			1
a @entity120 diplomat said : ‘ the @entity120 continues to argue against any increase to the @entity17 budget			0
‘ all @entity5 institutions should be looking for savings in their budgets , not increases			2

@entity1 is *representative* for foreign affairs and security policy
branded as indecisive and unable to deliver the *clout* needed
report : the @entity5 has reacted too late when crises have cropped up
