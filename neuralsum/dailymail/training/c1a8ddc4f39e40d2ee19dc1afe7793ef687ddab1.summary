@entity6 admitted charges of misconduct in public office and theft			0
the former officer , who was sacked by the chief constable earlier this year , claims @entity20 failed him by not protecting him from the risk of addiction or supporting him through his problems			1
@entity6 joined @entity20 in 2001 and trained as a ' test purchase ' officer in 2006			1
by 2009 @entity6 was using a wrap a day of heroin and was in touch with the drugs charity lifeline in 2008 , he joined the force 's @entity43 - which is dedicated to rooting out drug dealers using covert tactics			1
police have gone undercover as addicts in a number of crackdowns in recent years , most recently in @entity51 , which targeted street dealers in @entity53 , @entity13			0
whilst working for the unit , he was commended for his work by his commanders and a judge			0
but by 2009 , @entity6 was using a wrap a day of heroin and was in touch with the drugs charity lifeline			1
he was prescribed @entity61 and attempted to wean himself off the drug , but by 2012 he had lapsed			0
in july of that year , a drug dealer 's home was raided by police who found a @entity20 issue @entity68 gas canister and a baton which had been issued to @entity6			1
at the time , @entity6 was working at @entity72 police station on ' restricted duties ' after time off with depression			2
but twice in one morning he sneaked off his shift at the station to meet the dealer , raising bosses ' suspicions			0
a raid at @entity6 's home days later recovered a phone which revealed he had contacted the dealer 2,200 times in the previous four months			1

when he was sacked by sir @entity93 earlier this year , the chief constable described it as an ' enormous tragedy ' for a ' very hardworking officer ' and his family , the court heard			0
in a statement @entity6 said he ' simply needed help ' - and got ' no support from the force '			2
before he was jailed , the former officer told the @entity102 he was distraught at what he had put his family through , and accused @entity20 of ' forgoing the handling of their most valuable equipment - people '			2
jailing him , judge @entity107 said : ' i fully recognise that the defendant became addicted through his police service and he 's to be commended on the efforts he made in the interests of law and order			0
' but where police officers suffer because of their duties it is incumbent upon them to obtain treatment and help			0
' he did not do so - he did the very opposite - he continued his association with @entity122			0
' a significant sentence is called for to demonstrate the high standards the public expect from police			0
' after the case @entity20 dismissed some of @entity6 's claims			1
assistant chief constable @entity130 said : ' whatever personal mitigation @entity6 may have , it is not an excuse for such a wanton abuse of his position as a police officer			2
' when someone becomes a police officer , they take an oath to protect the public and quite clearly , @entity6 failed in that public duty			2
' @entity6 's drug addiction significantly clouded his judgement , so much so that he passed a prohibited weapon to a drug dealer in exchange for drugs			1
' he also seriously neglected his duties as a police officer leaving the station while on duty and the force area so he could attempt to buy drugs from @entity122			1
' that is not the sort of behaviour the public , or @entity20 , expects from a serving officer and as a result , not only has he now been convicted of a number of serious offences , but he has lost his reputation and the respect of his colleagues			0
' @entity20 's @entity166 is here to protect the public			0
the branch has a crucial role to play in ensuring that officers and staff uphold the very highest standards of behaviour and when there is evidence of criminality or misconduct , we will take action			0
' we must always remember that we police with the consent of the public , so i want to both warn officers and staff , and reassure our communities , that if we uncover any evidence of any @entity20 employees engaging in criminal activities or committing misconduct , that we will carry out a thorough investigation and regardless of rank or position , we will pursue these matters through the courts			0
