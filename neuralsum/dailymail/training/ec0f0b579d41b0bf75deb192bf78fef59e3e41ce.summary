by @entity0 hotels in the notorious party resort of @entity3 are set out to kick out a record number of yob @entity6 holidaymakers this year			1
nearly 100 troublemakers have been asked to leave already this year for smashing up their hotel rooms , fighting with others guests or assaulting staff			1
and hotel bosses are promising to get even tougher with unruly tourists after the rowdy @entity14 resort made headlines around the world over a video of a @entity6 teenager performing multiple sex acts in a bar for free booze			1
more than 100 tourists have already been kicked out of their @entity3 hotels for trashing their rooms or fighting a local hotel association says a staggering 92 of the 107 people members have kicked out so far this year were @entity6			1
the other 15 were @entity28			0
the shocking figures put @entity3 on course to break its record of expulsions , 254 last year and up from 147 in 2012 and 166 in 2011			1
the vast majority of those asked to leave in previous years , like this year , were @entity6			1
and around 35 per cent of the area ’s hotels do not belong to the association which released the figures yesterday , meaning the real number is likely to be slightly higher			1
@entity39 , vice president of the @entity40 , which covers the two sister resorts , said : ' the vast majority of the expulsions are down to three reasons			0
a @entity3 hotel association claims a staggering 92 of the 107 people kicked out so far this year were @entity6 the first is guests damaging hotel furniture , kicking doors down , smashing mirrors and even throwing tvs out of their rooms			1
' the others are fights with other guests and verbal and physical attacks on hotel staff			2
' the vast majority are always @entity6 men , aged between 18 and 25			1
tourists pictured on the @entity61 strip in @entity3 after a night out on the town ' we want young people who come to enjoy themselves but within a context of respect towards other guests			2
' we wo n’t tolerate people whose fun comes from antisocial behaviour which causes others to suffer			0
' it ’s got to be fun within certain limits			0
' virtually all the problems we ’re experiencing are connected to the misuse of drugs and alcohols and obviously we ’d urge these youngsters to take care			0
' troublemakers are put on a temporary black list so hoteliers know not to accept them			2
mr @entity84 explained : ' the association sends round an email with the name of the person that ’s been expelled so other members are pre-warned			2
' we cover 20,000 hotel beds in @entity3 and @entity92 so it is a very effective measure			1
' it ’s only information that ’s kept for a few days and not on a long - term basis			0
' most of the people that are expelled for bad behaviour promise they wo n’t do it again but we usually find a lot of them have already caused trouble before			0
' where there ’s been vandalism hoteliers try to get compensation from those who ’ve caused it but it ’s very difficult in practice			0
' usually we try to avoid getting the police involved unless it ’s very serious			0
' several hotels in the area have hired private security to address the problem			0
one hotel boss said : ' it ’s not that the problem has necessarily got worse but more that hotels are taking a tougher approach			2
' in many cases hotels now employ external security staff rather than depending on a night - time caretaker and a sole security guard they mostly employed themselves			0
