by @entity0 published : 10:09 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 12:29 est , 6 january 2014 millions of us will be embarking on @entity4 's resolutions to lose weight and eat more healthily this week , and for many , a new juicer is probably high on the shopping list			1
supermodels such as @entity10 and @entity11 have attributed their streamlined figures to whipping up vitamin - packed juices and smoothies in their kitchens			1
but rather than forking out hundreds of pounds on expensive gadgets , we might actually be better off buying much cheaper versions			1
juicing as a way to lose weight has never been so popular amongst svelte celebrities			2
@entity37 's @entity36 model @entity38 was so keen on her daily smoothie - a chia seed and goji berry concoction - that she invested £ 500 in a swanky blender , the @entity22			1
the kitchen device markets itself as much more than an ordinary blender thanks to laser - cut blades that reach speeds of 240 mph making light work of fruit and vegetable pulp , skin , pips and seeds			2
fresh fan : @entity38 made a video for @entity56 showing her fans how to whip up her morning smoothie using the expensive gadget which ? carried out laboratory tests on 28 different juicers and found that gadgets costing between £ 50 and £ 60 scored higher than those on sale for £ 350 or more			1
the top - scoring model , the @entity67 , costs £ 69.99 and was awarded 75 points out of a possible 100			1
next placed was the @entity69 6 in 1 costing £ 179 , with the £ 54.99 @entity71 juicer in third place			1
' a glass of fresh juice can be satisfyingly tasty and refreshing , especially if you 've made it yourself , ' said a which ? spokesman			2
' but think about how often you are likely to use your juicer , if you have the space , and if you are serious about juicing			2
' the @entity82 juicer came top in the which ? survey and costs just £ 69.99 last year a survey found that juicers and blenders were two of the top ten kitchen gadgets which most likely to be bought but rarely used			1
celebrity trainer @entity91 ( famous for training @entity92 and @entity94 ) is a fan , and personal trainer and nutrition expert @entity95 rates the machines highly too , using one to make 60 shakes a day at @entity98 , his @entity100 gym			0
he uses his to blend up shakes for the likes of @entity98 client @entity11 , who has previously extolled the virtues of his @entity105 and @entity106 smoothies mixed with almond milk and coconut oil			1
@entity110 , @entity111 at @entity112 , said : ' the numbers of stars following juice diets has sped into the stratosphere of late			0
' from a-listers wanting to get red carpet ready to reality stars wanting to trim down and get healthy , they 're all on board the juicing train			0
' so it was only a matter of time before a new juicing machine took celebsville by storm			0
' @entity22 is a new juicer that claims to speed up the juicing process and leave a smoother , ' no bits ' result			1
good news for juicing fans			2
' nutritionist @entity132 , who works with @entity133 , said : ' @entity22 is awesome , it is obviously the best of the bunch			1
however @entity137 are making some really good less expensive blenders too			0
' @entity140 ' one of the easiest models to use - and quiet too ' @entity69 6 - in - 1 ' extracts more great - tasting juice from fruit and veg than other models ' @entity146 and simple to use and clean ' @entity147 ' has a foam separator and easy to use ' @entity149 and juices efficiently ' personal trainer : @entity95 of @entity152 , who is credited with sculpting @entity11 and @entity155 's bodies , is also a fan of the @entity22 blender @entity11 , who has one of showbiz 's most enviable figures , recently praised her ‘ delicious green juice ' which she described as ' a great way to start the day			1
' but what ’s behind this mysterious concoction ? along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber , kale and parsley , the @entity166 wholefood chlorella is added to the juice			0
and it ’s not just @entity11 who ’s caught the chlorella bug , @entity10 has admitted that she takes chlorella supplements to keep her skin in check			1
green vegetable smoothie @entity178 , who ’s a nutritionist and green food expert at @entity180 , has shared her tips for the perfect morning smoothie ...			0
' with everyone from @entity11 to @entity133 drinking green smoothies recently , you ’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad			1
' we all know that we ’re probably not eating enough greens , yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			0
@entity197 smoothies can be high in vitamin @entity198 , which can help reduce tiredness , and magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			0
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity166 wholefood @entity216 chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity198 content as a 32oz steak			0
perhaps most importantly , these drinks provide large quantities of whole food natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy , this is hugely important			0
smoothies are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates			0
we recommend the @entity244 of blenders , the @entity22 blender , as it breaks down the cell walls of fresh , whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients			1
it also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once			0
' @entity38 and @entity11 ’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious , simply because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			1
combining these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible			0
juicing and blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens ( sprouts ) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways of creating optimum health and energy			0
just juice : @entity11 has revealed that she loves @entity180 ( like those pictured right ) green juices juicing or blending any raw green vegetable , especially the living leafy varieties , is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and helping to build healthy tissues			1
@entity283 maintains life and is a rejuvenator of all body systems			0
@entity197 smoothies containing the ingredients seen in @entity11 and @entity38 ’s can be high in vitamin @entity198 , which can help reduce tiredness			1
the spinach in @entity11 ’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			2
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity166 wholefood @entity307 contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity198 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin d in particular is important for winter , as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight , and long cold winters can cause @entity318 to become deficient , meaning it ’s important to top up where possible			2
to make a @entity11 or @entity38 style green smoothie , try the delicious recipe below at home			2
freshly juiced fruits should always be diluted 50:50 with water in order to dilute the sugar content			0
blend the below ingredients , adding the water first			0
600ml mineral water ( still ) ½ chopped cucumber ( skin & pips included ) ¼ peeled avocado 1 chopped celery stick juice of ½ lemon or lime ¼ teaspoon unrefined salt @entity216 chlorella ‘ a ’ tablets : initially starting off with 5 tablets for the first three days , moving up to 10 for the next 3 days and then 15 tablets herein after			0
small double handful ( 60 - 80mg ) of mixed green leaves from the following ( they can be combined ) : spinach , watercress , rocket , savoy cabbage , chard , lettuce , chicory , kale , bok choy , sprigs of mint , parsley , coriander , basil .			2

@entity10 and @entity11 are fans of the £ 500 @entity22
but which ? says there 's no need to splash out on deluxe versions
tests showed that gadgets costing £ 50 scored well
top - rated juicer was a @entity82 priced at just £ 69.99
