by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 17:46 est , 6 november 2013 triple - killer : @entity2 , 55 , was given a 40 - year jail term for murder a judge who refused to give a triple killer a whole life sentence because of a @entity11 human rights ruling was wrong , the government ’s most senior law officer ruled yesterday			1
mr @entity12 had said last month that it was ‘ not appropriate ’ to sentence @entity2 to die behind bars because @entity15 judges had ruled such terms were a breach of human rights			1
but yesterday the attorney general , @entity20 , declared the 40 - year jail term to be too soft , and referred the case back to the @entity23			1
he said a whole - life tariff ‘ ought to have been made on the facts of the case ’			0
a spokesman said : ‘ after careful consideration , the attorney general has decided to make a reference to the @entity23 in relation to the sentence of @entity2 for the murder of @entity33			1
‘ @entity2 received a sentence of life imprisonment with a 40 - year minimum term			1
‘ the attorney general considers that a whole - life order ought to have been made on the facts of the case and that the sentence was therefore unduly lenient			1
’ three @entity23 judges will consider the case within weeks and could increase the sentence if they agree with mr @entity20			2
@entity2 , 55 , butchered good samaritan @entity33 , 66 , while on day release in july from an earlier prison term for murder			2
mr @entity33 was fatally stabbed in the neck when he interrupted @entity2 robbing the home of an 87 - year - old neighbour @entity50			2
@entity2 was on day release from @entity52 , @entity53 , where he was serving a 25 - year term for the murder of @entity57 barman @entity56 whom he stabbed multiple times in 1992			2
he had already served time for the 1984 killing of @entity62 , 49 , who he had hit over the head with a hammer , and so was expected to be put behind bars forever			0
but sentencing him at the @entity67 on october 21 , the judge said he could not pass a whole - life term			0
call for review : attorney general , @entity20 has declared the 40 - year jail term to be too soft and that the @entity23 consider the sentence based upon the facts of the case @entity75 is the ‘ best pupil in class ’ for obeying edicts from @entity15 , a senior eurocrat declared yesterday			1
at a @entity83 hearing , @entity80 , secretary general of the @entity81 , said the rest of the continent looked to the @entity75 to set an example on human rights			1
he then claimed that if the @entity75 did not obey the diktat on prisoner votes , it would set a bad example to countries such as @entity93			0
and he warned that @entity75 ’s international influence would be diminished if it decided to go for the ‘ nuclear possibility ’ of not complying with the ruling			0
@entity99 said : ‘ this is yet more patronising drivel from the eurocrats			0
‘ the idea we should sacrifice democracy at home to promote the @entity11 agenda abroad is a faustian bargain @entity83 should reject			0
’ he told the court the whole - life order was a breach of @entity112 three of the @entity113 and it was ‘ not appropriate ’ to impose such a term			0
the judge was following a @entity15 ruling made in july which said whole - life terms were unlawful			2
but its decision is not binding on domestic courts and ministers have not yet declared how they will respond			0
the judge ’s decision was criticised on the day by justice secretary @entity125			0
he said : ‘ we are considering the government ’s response to the @entity113 ’s recent ruling but this in no way alters that fact and courts should continue to impose whole life tariffs where they wish to do so			0
’ yesterday the @entity33 family ’s mp , @entity138 , said : ‘ @entity2 has killed three times , on separate occasions			2
‘ it beggars belief we are unable to pass a whole - life sentence because of his human rights			1
‘ mr @entity33 ’s family , and the whole local community , deserve justice and i am pleased the attorney general agrees that the sentence is unduly lenient and is going to refer this case to the @entity23			1

@entity2 , 55 , was not given a life sentence for third killing
@entity15 judges rule sentence to die in prison breaches human rights
attorney general deems sentence ' unduly lenient ' and send it for review
