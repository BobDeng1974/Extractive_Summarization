@entity0 has given @entity1 his ultimate backing by insisting he would have paid £ 100million to sign the striker			1
@entity1 became the biggest signing in @entity6 's history at £ 28m last month and he will be aiming to prove a point when he faces @entity8 for the first time on saturday			1
@entity11 's hamstring injury , which is likely to rule him out for six - to - seven weeks , has again raised the debate about whether @entity8 were too quick to let the young @entity14 centre forward leave , particularly with doubts over @entity17 ' long - term future and whether @entity18 will be as effective in his second spell			1
when asked about the difference in the respective fees for @entity1 and @entity11 , @entity0 replied : ' they are different ages and the situation at @entity36 is very different in how they work			1
sometimes as a club you have a say and sometimes you have investment groups who have a say			2
that could be one answer			2
' secondly , it 's not about the value			2
i would have paid £ 100m for @entity1			1
if i had the money , why not ? ' the figure is insignificant			0
it is about the character and type of player you want in the group			0
sometimes a player at £ 3m can be an expensive buy and sometimes a player at £ 28m can be a very cheap buy			1
' it will be intriguing to see how @entity1 handles the occasion of facing @entity8 , given that there was a cold relationship between him and @entity65 , which stemmed from how the 21 - year - old left the club on transfer deadline day 12 months ago to join @entity6			1
point to prove : @entity1 failed to make the cut at @entity8 despite the west @entity72 side 's striker shortage worth £ 100m ? @entity1 's @entity74 record he only made 15 appearance for @entity8 and never scored for them , spending the majority of his three years at @entity77 on loan , but @entity0 does not have any concerns that @entity1 – who he expects to be available after a toe problem – will be preoccupied about proving a point			1
' i know what you are saying , ' said @entity0			2
' my answer is of course he is human and leading up to the game people will say you are facing your old team - mates and manager			0
but what i am saying is at this level , the level of performance will not change from against @entity97 or @entity98			0
' he has a status and vital role for us			0
i see him wanting to play 90 minutes against @entity98 when he was not ready , and wanting to stay on against @entity97 when it would be easy for him to say he wanted to be ready for @entity8 and so wait until he is 100 per cent			2
' he is not going through the motions he is raising his levels			0
every game he is fresh so i do not see any difference at all			0
@entity108 has found a very strong inner motivation			0
we are excited about what he can give us			0
it is not about him facing his former club			0
' bounce back : @entity0 will look to see off @entity8 at @entity116 after settling for a 2 - 2 draw against @entity97 @entity118 denies @entity65 rift on @entity6 arrival			1

@entity1 looks set to start against former side @entity8 on saturday
