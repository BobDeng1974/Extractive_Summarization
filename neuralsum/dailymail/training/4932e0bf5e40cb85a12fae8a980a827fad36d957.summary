@entity0 in 2005 was the last trophy won by @entity3 's side chief executive @entity4 tells agm @entity5 will thrive under @entity6 the @entity7 are already 10 points off the pace in the @entity10 @entity4 defended @entity3 's record against big - spending rivals by @entity13 published : 06:20 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 17:41 est , 25 october 2012 @entity15 leaped to the defence of his @entity5 regime in the face of a fierce attack from club shareholders			1
the @entity7 board , including majority shareholder @entity15 , chief executive @entity4 and chairman @entity23 , came under scathing criticism from supporters at the annual general meeting			1
testing times : @entity3 spoke at the @entity5 - less than 24 hours after @entity5 's home defeat to @entity29 big blow : @entity5 were beaten at home by @entity29 in the @entity32 on wednesday night supporters are disillusioned with the perceived lack of investment in the playing squad and the cost of tickets			1
@entity15 said : ‘ i am ambitious for the club			0
we have an exciting future and our goal is to win trophies			0
’ not even the silver - tongued @entity3 could keep the heat off @entity5 ’s board at thursday 's stormy agm			1
the manager did his best to placate irate fans who arrived intent on venting their anger at the top table			0
heated : @entity5 chief executive @entity4 had to call for order at the agm but no amount of smooth talking was going to prevent the @entity7 ’ supporters from making their feelings clear			1
majority shareholder @entity15 was roundly jeered by shareholders when refusing to provide a definitive answer on whether he has plans to take a dividend percentage out of the club coffers			0
similar treatment was dished out to chief executive @entity4 as he reeled off reasons why @entity5 will be in a financial position to compete in the transfer market for the world ’s best players in two years			1
serious business : majority shareholder @entity15 ( left ) , chairman @entity23 and and @entity4 ‘ we ’ve heard it all before , ’ yelled shareholders as @entity4 spelt out why the club ’s self - sustaining financial model means on - the - pitch success will follow in the not - too - distant future			1
it ’s hard not to have a degree of sympathy with @entity5 supporters			1
no trophy since 2005 , two successive summers of losing their best players and a team 10 points adrift of @entity10 leaders @entity87			1
and if the heckling was not enough , there were even boos for the club ’s 76 - year - old chairman @entity23 , whose patronising behaviour towards supporters angered shareholders			2
unpleasant viewing : @entity3 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) at the @entity29 game on wednesday night as ever , @entity3 tried his best but even the @entity98 could not ignore the fact divisions are starting to appear , particularly among the club ’s fan base			2
‘ there seems to be a lot of dissatisfaction , i can understand that , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ but we have to be united			0
i accept every different opinion but it looks to me like the modern world produces little groups of little opinion			0
‘ the little communities need to live together for the common strength of our club , for the good of @entity5			2
sometimes you can forget that			0
but if everybody is devastated when we finish third in the league , i promise i wo n’t be here when we finish 15th in the league			0
' players ask : are you in the @entity32 ? a new player does n't want to know if you have won the @entity123			2
' if only : @entity5 supporters would love to see the likes of @entity126 in an @entity7 shirt - the @entity29 played swapped jerseys at the end of wednesday night 's @entity32 clash at the @entity131 @entity3 was the only top - table speaker afforded a round of applause			1
and it is important to add that the vitriol was in no way aimed at him			0
it was not long after the 11.30am start that supporters started to convey their growing displeasure			0
why are the tickets so expensive ? why do we keep selling our best players ? why do we not spend heavily in the transfer market ? why does it cost £ 13.90 for fish and chips ? the probing questions kept coming from supporters fed up with paying top prices without getting trophies in return			0
there was a cringeworthy moment for @entity4 when around 15 hands went up as the meeting was asked if anyone did not agree with his re-election as chief executive for another term			1
but @entity23 ’s reaction to @entity4 ’s naysayers was on an altogether different scale of discomfort as he mumbled into his microphone : ‘ the same lot again			2
’ yes , @entity23 , the same lot again			0
the same lot who are facing an eighth season without silverware and want answers			0
gone : @entity5 sold their best player - captain @entity172 - to @entity173 in the summer			1
