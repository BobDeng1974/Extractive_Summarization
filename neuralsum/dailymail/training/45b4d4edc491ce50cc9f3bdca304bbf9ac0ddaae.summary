@entity1 and @entity0 stressed on monday at their joint press conference that their countries were united on the issue of @entity38 aggression			1
the @entity21 president said that even though his country and the @entity33 countries it is aligned with may disagree tactically on how to approach @entity38 if peace talks fail , they are ' completely unified ' on the broader issue			1
' we stand up for the same principles of inviolability of territorial integrity , ' @entity1 said in her remarks , according to the @entity5 's translation			2

' we have to put all our efforts in bringing about a diplomatic solution , ' she said			0
@entity0 said he too favors peace talks and hopes sanctions will weaken @entity38 enough to bring @entity43 to the table			2
but if diplomacy fails , @entity0 said , the @entity21 will look at all available options , including lethal weapons			1
after a @entity2 reporter referred to him as ' @entity81 , ' per a translation , and asked where is ' red line ' is on the issue , @entity0 refused to provide a specific timeline and said a decision would come about as part of an ' ongoing analysis ' of @entity38 's encroachment on @entity9			1
he later said of the decision before him , ' the measure by which i make these decisions is : " is it more likely to be effective than not ? " and that is what our deliberations will be about			0
' ' we are not looking for @entity38 to fail			0
we are not looking for @entity38 to be surrounded and contained and weakened			0
the @entity21 ' preference , he said , is for a ' strong , prosperous , vibrant , confident @entity38 that can be a partner with us			2
' ' unfortunately , ' he said , @entity38 made a decision that is not only ' bad for them strategically ' but bad for @entity33 and for the world			1
' in the face of this aggression and these bad decisions , we ca n't simply try to talk them out of it , ' @entity0 continued			0
' we have to show them that the world is unified in imposing a cost for this aggression			0
' and that 's what we 're going to continue to do , ' he added			0

' she told reporters that she and @entity130 were looking to bring about a ceasefire with talks and at least create conditions in which civilians not dying			0
' i myself would not be able to live with not having made this attempt , ' she said of this week 's meeting			2
if a point in time comes in which it becomes clear that ' success is not possible , ' however , then the @entity21 and @entity33 will have to come together and discuss next steps , she noted			1
the @entity160 decided monday to temporarily hold off on slapping more sanctions on @entity38 and @entity9 separatists while awaiting the outcome of the peace talks			2

the meeting in the @entity176 capital takes place with @entity1 and @entity130 deeply opposed to arming @entity9 in its bid to push back the separatists that @entity179 and the @entity21 insist are being armed by @entity38 , which also has troops fighting in the eastern @entity9			1
opponents of arming @entity182 believe that could open a proxy war between @entity27 and @entity185			0
@entity1 and @entity130 insist the only way to end the conflict is through diplomacy			2

' i have no doubt that additional assistance of economic kind and other kinds will be going to @entity9			0
and we do so understanding that there is no military solution , ' he said			0
' the solution is a political , diplomatic one			0
' but president @entity43 's got to make the decision to take an off ramp			2
and we have to make it clear to him that we are absolutely committed to the sovereignty and integrity of @entity9 no matter what , ' @entity209 said in response to a direct question about sending arms			0
at the @entity235 over the weekend , vice president @entity234 had stopped short of explicitly addressing possible arms deliveries			0
' we will continue to provide @entity9 with security assistance not to encourage war , but to allow @entity9 to defend itself , ' he said			0

' it is time for president @entity0 to quit equivocating and quickly provide @entity9 the defensive weapons it needs , ' he said			1
@entity263 , a @entity241 who has announced that he 's considering a presidential bid , said ' @entity0 ’s continual weakness in the face of aggression is making the world a more dangerous place			1
' ' his reluctance to provide defensive weapons – which @entity9 desperately needs to protect themselves against @entity38 intervention – is another low point in a presidency which has many to choose from , ' @entity263 charged			1
the current situation ' once again shows that under president @entity0 ’s leadership it is better to be @entity21 ’s enemy than her friend , ' he continued			1
' it ’s a sad fact that our enemies are seldom challenged while our friends are constantly undercut and abandoned			0
' more than 5,300 people have been killed since fighting began in april , according to a @entity303 tally , and the bloodshed has markedly increased over the past two weeks			0
on monday , a powerful explosion rocked a chemical plant and set it on fire outside the separatist stronghold of @entity309 in eastern @entity9			0
