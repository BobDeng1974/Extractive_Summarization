by @entity0 men start becoming ‘ invisible ’ sexually to younger women at 39 - the same age as @entity4 and @entity5 , according to new research			1
they begin turning into ‘ @entity7 ’ from the end of their 30s onwards - and are viewed more as father figures than sex symbols			1
the most obvious sign of the change is when a man is no longer eyed up by women when he goes out			0
@entity4 was pictured last month showing grey hair in his beard - but days later all the silver had disappeared , suggesting he had resorted to dyeing it			1
they 're invisible too ! @entity5 , left , and @entity32 are also at the age where women believe the first flecks of grey hair and the emergence of a double chin make them unattractive other famous 39 - year - olds include the comedian @entity5 and @entity38 stars @entity32 and @entity39			1
in the survey , 52 per cent of respondents said that men start to lose their allure to opposite sex as they are about to turn 40			0
this was due to a number of factors - not all concerned with ageing			0

the second most popular sign was greying hair - picked by 37 per cent of those surveyed			0
other signs included a double chin , thinning hair and having bad teeth			2
a spokesperson from the @entity71 , who commissioned the survey , said : ' turning 40 is key turning point and it is the most popular age for men to seek a hair transplant			1
' you only have to look at @entity79 to see how true that is			0
he turned 40 in february and admitted having a transplant to fill out his temples where he had started to lose his hair			0
he clearly did n’t want to become " @entity7 "			2
' has @entity39 lost it ? six out of ten women assume that most men in their late 30s , like @entity39 , pictured , left , this year and , right , aged 25 in @entity89 in 2000 , are attached by that age and are not worth approaching			2
