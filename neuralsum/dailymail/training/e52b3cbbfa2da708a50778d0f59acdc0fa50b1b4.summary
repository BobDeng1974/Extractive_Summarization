@entity0 will make a fresh move to take @entity2 on loan as the former @entity5 no 1 weighs up his options now that he has been dropped by @entity7			1
the @entity5 boss insists he wants to keep @entity2 at the club as it affords him the luxury of having two of the world 's best goalkeepers			0
but @entity0 will test that resolve			0
they want to bring in @entity2 - as well as @entity5 goalkeeping coach , @entity15 - and would prefer to do a loan deal as it would help them in meeting @entity19 's @entity20 restrictions			1
@entity0 see @entity2 as the ideal man to help them win the @entity36 , deeming him better than current no 1 , @entity31 @entity30 , and would have no problem matching his wages			0
