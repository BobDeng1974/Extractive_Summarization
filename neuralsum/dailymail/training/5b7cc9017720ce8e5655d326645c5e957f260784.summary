by @entity0 published : 13:36 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 13:39 est , 22 november 2013 a failing school has been attacked after advertising for maths teachers with just four gcses			1
south @entity4 is seeking two ' unqualified ' teachers for the subject , for which it says the minimum requirement is four gcses at a * to c grade			1
the criteria - which teachers have said will ' shock ' parents whose children attend the school - means that successful applicants could be less qualified than the government 's minimum education standards for school leavers			1
the academy has said that one of the four gcse passes must be in maths ' in order to ensure the highest possible standards of student achievement '			2
lax : the advertisement prominently states that applicants only need four gcses to apply special measure : @entity34 has branded teaching at @entity36 ' inadequate ' but while the advert says that a degree in mathematics would be desirable for the job , it makes clear that further training is not essential			1
the academy school , which has 1,163 pupils , has been in special measures following an @entity34 inspection which found the quality of teaching there ' inadequate '			1
a teaching union has branded the advert ' utterly inappropriate ' , claiming parents at the school will be ' absolutely shocked '			1
@entity53 , principal of the academy , states in the 12 - page job pack : ' this is a key role for the academy as we move forward			0
' we are now ready to take the next step on our journey to becoming an outstanding academy			0
' you will be joining an ambitious , committed and hardworking team who are passionate about the difference we can make to our young people , staff , families and the wider community			0
' the job is advertised as ‘ temporary until july 2014 ’ with a closing date for applications of friday , 29 november			1
it lists as essential qualifications at least 4 @entity75 ’s ( a * - c ) or equivalent , including @entity76 and @entity77 , being ' an excellent classroom practitioner ' and having an understanding of health and safety issues			0
earlier this month the academy - @entity82 , an educational charity - was issued with a warning letter from a government minister about the ' unacceptably low standards of performance of pupils '			0
all change : 29 members of staff have left the school since june this followed the latest @entity34 inspection , which found ' serious weaknesses ' over the achievement of pupils and the quality of teaching which was judged ' inadequate '			1
since then , 29 teachers , assistants and other staff have left the academy , as have two senior managers			0
@entity103 , deputy general secretary of the @entity104 , said : ' parents will absolutely shocked to think that any child of theirs would be taught by someone with four gcses			1
' the government talks continually about standards			0
four gcses do not measure up to the five @entity111 they expect the majority of pupils to be achieving at present			2
' it gives a lie to @entity117 ’s claims that his policy is to allow top professionals such as engineers to become teachers and shows it is about teaching on the cheap			2
' this travesty is a direct result of the coalition government ’s decision to allow unqualified teachers into our classrooms			0
' this policy needs to be reversed before we see any more of this utterly inappropriate employment practice being put into action			0
' the @entity82 sponsors a chain of 40 academies including secondary , primary , infant and junior schools and claims ' a proven track record of securing transformational change and sustainable school improvement '			2
it is led by sir @entity142 , who has acted as an adviser to the @entity144 .			0

south @entity4 advertised for the two post
the school is in special measure after @entity34 branded it ' inadequate '
teaching *groups* say parents will be ' absolutely shocked '
