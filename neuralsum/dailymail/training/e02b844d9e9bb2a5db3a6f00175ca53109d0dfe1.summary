a @entity0 spotted hovering above a popular beach has sparked mystery in a seaside resort			1
the unidentified object was caught on camera flying over @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , and has prompted people to take to social media in their droves in an attempt to decipher its origin			1
the three - pointed object has been touted as an alien @entity0 , a drone and even a @entity17 bomber plane after it was photographed last week			1
the photo was sent to the @entity37 , which receives about 40 to 45 sightings every year however , it has now been claimed the mystery object was a radio - controlled seagull , which was fitted with a camera before being flown through the skies			1
the great @entity0 mystery began on thursday when @entity45 , of @entity37 , posted a photo on his @entity48 page of the object			1
he accompanied the picture with the caption : ' just received this photo 2 of 2 from a person in @entity7			1
any ideas what this object could be ? ' taken at @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 17th february 2015			1
but i have no idea what it is ? the second sighting i have witnessed around @entity8 in two weeks			2
' in a post just days earlier , he uploaded an image of a snowy field with a dark , unusual - looking object hovering in the sky above			1
he captioned the photograph : ' just received this photo 1 of 2 from a person in @entity7			1
taken at @entity71 , @entity8 3 february 2015			2
' he said both of the photographs were sent to him by a resident of @entity7 , who did n't notice the objects when he took the photos and only realised they were in the frame when he downloaded them to his computer			2
the posts were greeted with dozens of responses who claimed the objects could be a drone or one of the @entity28 fighter jet 's which were sent to intercept two @entity88 bombers off the coast of @entity8 last week			1
mr @entity45 also received this photo via his @entity37 , which was taken by a resident of @entity7			1
he said he could not decipher what the dark object was situated in the top right hand - side of the frame he said he had tried to zoom in on the object but had only managed to see a dark object due to the resolution the bizarre object sparked mystery for days until @entity101 claimed the object was in fact his uncle 's remote - controlled seagull			1
he told the @entity106 : ' i can confirm that the " @entity0 " in the photo was my great uncle 's @entity108 with a camera			1
' the photos are of before and during flight of the @entity108 before we crashed it upon landing on the cliff			0
' please apologise for the confusion for us			0
' the lightweight model ' aircraft ' is inspired by a seagull – complete with lifelike features and colourings – and is operated with an aerial and radio			2
it is not known whether it was being used for fun or as a deterrent to other @entity129 in the area			0
it has also not been confirmed by any experts whether it was in fact the ' seagull ' which was the @entity0 in the photographs			2
the supposed revelation sparked surprise online , with many finding it rather amusing			0
@entity138 wrote : ' so funny			0
the councils should get a load of these and use them outside food establishments to stop us getting attacked			0
' while @entity144 added : ' brilliant ! if only all of life 's mysteries were solved so easily			0
' however , mr @entity45 said he was still rather dubious that the object was the remote - controlled seagull and not something more sinister , such as aliens			1
he told @entity152 : ' i do n't know whether it is that			0
one of the problems with the photo is that it was taken on a low resolution phone			2
i 've tried to zoom in but all i get is a pixelated image			0
' i did notice that in the top left - hand side there was a very bright area , a white light			0
' one of things you 've got to try and work out is the distance from the camera , where the object was seen			0
' it 's hard to judge because it 's over the sea and the camera is quite far away but it seems a bit big to me to be a model seagull			0
' mr @entity45 said he had never come across remote or radio - controlled seagulls before			1
he said : ' it 's the first time i 've ever seen one , it seems he has some pretty hefty gear to fly it with			0
' if the resolution was a lot better , i could 've zoomed in and actually seen what it was but when i zoomed in you could just see black			0
' in 2011 , this ' @entity0 ' was caught on camera flying through the sky at @entity189 near @entity190 , @entity8			1
the image was taken by a walker who only noticed the mystery object upon downloading his photos to his laptop this photo by @entity198 last year appeared to show a mysterious flash of light ( left ) above the seaside resort of @entity202			1
it was never determined what the @entity0 actually was , but it may have been a meteor it is not the first time mysterious objects have been spotted above the county and the @entity37 claims the region has more paranormal activity than anywhere else in @entity213			2
mr @entity45 said he gets about 40 to 45 sightings every year and said they often ' come in waves '			0
last year , amateur photographer @entity198 captured a ' mysterious object ' flashing across the sky as he photographed cloud formations above the seaside resort of @entity202			1
the grandfather 's erie photograph showed an unexplained flash of light streaking across the sky and he spent weeks puzzling over the identity of the @entity0 , which he initially thought was the result of a problem with his camera			2
the object , which appeared to have a triangular shape , appeared in the so - called ' @entity230 ' , an area off the @entity8 coast where spooky sightings are common			1
however , while its exact existence was never determined , sceptics suggested that it was likely to be a meteor burning up in the sky as it shot towards @entity239			0
and in 2011 , a ' @entity0 ' was caught on camera flying through the sky at @entity189 near @entity190 , @entity8			1
the image was captured by a walker who did n't notice it in his photograph until he downloaded it to his computer hours later			0
mr @entity45 , who founded @entity37 in 1995 , said at the time : ' the person who took the photo never saw anything in the area while taking the photo			0
' it was only when he got home and downloaded it onto his computer that he saw an object - a disc shaped craft , hovering just above the sea			2
' there appear to be two trails of water beneath the object which looks as though they are falling from it in to the sea			0
' it could be that the object has just emerged from the sea			0
' mr @entity45 could not shed any further light on the origins of the object , which left many scratching their heads for an explanation			0
however , some people pointed out that it could have been a seagull during mid-flight and mr @entity45 himself also said that @entity282 confirmed to him that it was a seagull .			2
