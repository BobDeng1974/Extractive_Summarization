a disturbing report has revealed some of the disgusting conditions visitors experience in @entity5 hotels , with faecal matter discovered on kitchen utensils			1
an investigation into the @entity9 on the @entity10 in @entity11 has uncovered severely unhygienic conditions , despite the fact the hotel is accredited as a ‘ four star hotel ’			1
the ‘ hotel from hell ’ was inspected by a current affair after teams of negative reviews and concerning photographs were posted online from disturbed guests			1
biotech scientists took swabs of the rooms and were revolted by what they discovered			1
the most concerning were faecal particles on the kitchen ’s chopping board			1
swabs of glasses and mugs from the kitchen found bacteria levels that are twenty times the acceptable standard			2
‘ they should have less than six bacteria per square centimetre			2
we found it had in excess of 120 bacteria , ’ said dr @entity48			0
the presence of such a high level of bacteria could have catastrophic effects on the health of guests , meaning contracting a sickness during their holiday is highly likely			1
" we 're now looking at a situation where you could actually get sick by using some of these facilities , " mr @entity48 said			0
‘ if someone ’s had food poisoning , were getting over it and they ’ve used that glass , there ’s every chance ( the germ ) is going to be on it and it ’s then going to be passed onto the next people that stay in the room			1
’ discoloured and hole - ridden curtains were a shock discovery from guests expecting four star accommodation			1
however , despite the awful exterior , the unseen bacteria and faecal matter should be holiday makers biggest concern images show that the hotel is in a state of decay and disrepair , with this door cracked and peeling last week , a @entity108 family who stayed in the hotel were horrified when their two - year - old daughter suffered flea bites from playing on the carpet in the hotel , according to the @entity115			1
despite being charged $ 2500 for their week - long stay , the @entity116 found ‘ the bathroom was mouldy , the carpets filthy , there were only three chairs and the louvres were broken			1
they were offered another room but claim it was ‘ just in the same condition			0
’ manager @entity126 told the @entity115 that their four - star rating was legitimate as it had been awarded by @entity128			1
he also claimed @entity128 gave the hotel 90 per cent for cleanliness			1
after @entity49 ’s investigation , mr @entity126 also claimed that the reason so many people complain is because they have deliberately damaged property in the room			1
he says people are ‘ clever cheats ’ who ‘ go to extreme to find fault to get discount especially when our prices are at peak high prices			2
’ manager @entity126 denies all accusations and insists his hotel is deserves its four star accreditation dr @entity48 studied swabs taken from one of the hotel room and was disgusted to find faecal matter and intense concentrations of bacteria mr @entity126 was also adamant that the hotel was not guilty of false advertising			1
‘ i argue that the words magnificent and luxurious or any other terms are open to broad interpretation , ’ he said in a statement to @entity155			0
‘ @entity159 holds high priority in all areas of cleanliness , room services and general amenities , ’ he said			1
‘ issues do happen and they get fixed in any business			0
’ however , during a hidden camera investigation the reality of the rooms ’ revolting conditions were unveiled			0
stomach churning images unveil the hotel 's ‘ dirty secrets			2
’ ‘ @entity176 on the taps , on the wall fittings , the mirror was n’t cleaned properly , it ’s just really grubby , ’ former hotel guest @entity47 told @entity49 , after he and his family were revolted when they arrived for a recent holiday			2
he was bewildered as to how the hotel could possibly be rated four stars , remarking ‘ i could n’t put a star to it			1
’ a for effort : at least the hotel tried to repair this bin , albeit a little haphazardly with sticky tape			2
however , maybe replacing the cheap plastic item would have been preferable stomach churning images unveil the hotels ‘ dirty secrets ' , even though the manager insists people are lying to try and scam cheap or free accomodation the hotel claims it rarely receives complaints and rooms are cleaned thoroughly			1
however , the @entity205 has been bombarded with scathing reviews online			0
‘ we entered the smelly walkway which wreaked of garbage to the room , uhh ohh we thought , ’ wrote @entity207			0
‘ the room was dark , dirty , dusty , mouldy and housed a disgusting foul odour			0
’ @entity213 was horrified when her partner cut himself in the pool and the blood was left by cleaners for an extensive period of time			0
‘ my partner and i went for a swim in the pool where he stepped on something sharp at the bottom and cut open his toe			0
‘ he got out of the pool and there was plenty of blood all over the floor			0
when i went to tell the man at reception he didnt seem to care much			0
. nor did they clean the blood for over an hour ! ’ wrote @entity213			0
the hotel has been bombarded with complaints and during the investigation many of the current guests voiced their disgust on camera the walls are marked but it 's alleged there has been no effort to fix them , allegedly making the hotel extremely unwelcoming @entity248 and @entity249 both separately called the hotel the worst and the dirtiest motel rooms they have ever had the displeasure of staying in			1
‘ dirty and old room			0
in the hallway , there were empty beer bottles left for the 3 days which we stayed			0
was the worst hotel i have ever stayed in , ’ wrote @entity248			2
‘ the dirtiest motel room i have ever been in			0
there was mould on the curtains , in the bathroom and under the surface saver on the kitchen bench tops , ’ @entity249 wrote			2
‘ there were sweat stains on the lounge chairs , stains on the pillows and the carpet was disgusting			0
’ however , the manager insists that guests have a lovely time when they stay at the @entity159			1
‘ @entity159 value its guests and provide best and efficient services to all it 's ( sic ) guests to make it comfortable and enjoyable in all circumstances during their stay , ’ he wrote			1
‘ our staff 's ( sic ) go out of their way to make sure their demands are fulfilled			0
’ however , when asked if former guest @entity47 would recommend staying at the hotel , he responded , ‘ just do n’t do it			2
please , please do n’t do it			0
’ this image shows the delightful view from one of the hotel windows : a rank , dirty rooftop			2

the @entity9 in @entity298 has been *inundated* with complaints from disgusted guests
scientific *analysis* discovered faecal matter on chopping board
the hotel is also accused of having mould , fleas and is in disrepair
the manager insists cleanliness and *customer* *satisfaction* is a priority
claims people are just trying to scam a free stay with false complaints
he also claims the hotel deserves its ' four star ' accreditation
