' we 've also had customer feedback in support of us selling the game , and we respect their perspective on the issue			2
@entity23 is an avid fan of the game and even has her own @entity58 character called ' @entity59 ' ' however , we feel the decision to stop selling @entity28 is in line with the majority view of our customers			1
' manager of @entity66 site @entity67 says the move is ' ridiculous ' and disputes claims that the game incites violence towards women			1

' it never offended me , it does n't offend me now and i grew up alight			0
' i do n't go out and mow down people or pull a gun out and spray them or anything , so i just think it 's a little bit over the top			0
' @entity85 claims that there is a significant amount of violence towards men throughout the game and believes women are in short supply			2
she said she was ' speechless ' as to why @entity58 had been specifically targeted and believes that parents who wo n't let their kids play the game , would probably be happy to give them permission to sit through an episode of @entity98 , or read a chapter from @entity100			0
' if i do n't like someone 's clothing , i 'm not going to ask the store to ban a certain type of shorts , ' she said			0

' @entity85 believes the campaigners against the game are ' misinformed ' and ' threw a tantrum ' when they did n't get what they wanted			2
' i 'm all for feminists and women 's rights but this is going a bit too far			0
26 - year - old @entity85 believes big retailers such as @entity3 and @entity2 should not have to suffer financially due to this unjust petition			1
' i do n't know why gamers should be punished for something that 's not our fault , or the retailers fault because they 've gone through all the standards and checked the game , ' she said			0

' there are prostitutes in the game , there is a strip club in the game but very few of them that you see			2
' reports that the game depicts women as bimbos and prey for men has angered @entity85			2
' most of them are actually dressed quite normally			0
' games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women , ' the petition said ' these people actually look like they 're going to work , they 've got the content that perfect that some people are in uniform or they 're in work clothes or summer gear			0
' @entity85 said little children are the worst offenders in online forums			2
' they 're the ones that taunt you on the microphone , saying ' i 'm going to f * * k you mum ' and ' f you this ' , and ' f that ' , it 's insane and they should n't be playing it ' she said			0
