@entity0 scored after just 57 seconds as @entity1 beat @entity2 1 - 0 in a scrappy game to reach the last 16 of the @entity4			1
the striker 's fourth goal in as many games threatened to spark a rout , but @entity1 ultimately flattered to deceive			1

but the well - organised @entity67 side defended resolutely and @entity1 's performance became disjointed as the game wore on			1
@entity1 , unbeaten so far this season , has not lost at home in @entity73 competition since nov. 2006 and tops @entity74 with 10 points - one more than @entity76 , who won 2 - 0 away to @entity78 thanks to two goals from @entity81 star @entity80			1
@entity9 is nursing a heel injury and hopes to be fit to face league leader @entity83 on sunday			1
@entity0 started at center forward , flanked by @entity36 and @entity32			2
having scored a last - gasp winner away to @entity2 two weeks ago , it was the total opposite this time - with a well - taken effort signalling the @entity91 forward 's return to form after some poor early - season performances			0
full back @entity28 broke down the right and picked out @entity0 just inside the penalty area			2
with his back to goal , he flicked the ball up , spun and hit a firm shot that goalkeeper @entity99 fumbled , as the ball slipped through his fingers and rolled over the line			0
@entity2 missed their only chance to level in the 12th minute when midfielder @entity52 whacked a shot high over the bar after goalkeeper @entity27 had beaten away a header from midfielder @entity53			2
after a brief spell of neat possession football from @entity2 , @entity1 tore up the field , again exposing the visitors ' weak left flank			2
the @entity115 champions ' charismatic captain and star striker was forced to watch the game from the stands former @entity76 and @entity119 midfielder @entity33 jumps for the ball during the @entity4 clash @entity15 striker @entity0 dives through the air to head the ball while an aghast @entity2 player watches on @entity32 released @entity12 after a quick one - two and , from his curling cross , @entity0 rushed in to beat @entity99 with a stooping header that bounced off the foot of the right post			1
the rebound fell to @entity36 but , with @entity32 getting in his way , he was unable to line up a shot			0
@entity12 saw his angled shot skim just past the left post in the 27th after midfielder @entity34 picked him out with a cross from the left , and soon after @entity12 left three defenders in his wake as he burst from midfield before forcing @entity99 into a low save			0
@entity2 looked lively at times going forward , only to lose possession too easily			0
from one failed attack , @entity32 carved a hole in midfield and released @entity34 , who then touched the ball on to @entity0 , bearing down from the right			2
but @entity0 hesitated , decided against shooting , and then tried rounding @entity99 , only to lose his footing and go to ground			0
with only 64 seconds played of the second half , @entity0 almost repeated the his first - half trick but fluffed his shot from the near the penalty spot and , three minutes later , his curling effort from just inside the penalty area went wide of the upright			0
@entity12 then tried jinking his way to goal , but got the ball tangled up in his feet after trying to beat a third defender , and the crowd 's frustration was audible when @entity0 hit a shot well over after @entity32 's cut - back from the right			1
former @entity169 manager @entity168 complains to the linesman after awarding a throw in against @entity1 former @entity172 man @entity55 rises above @entity33 while @entity57 beats @entity0 to the ball @entity1 fans raise their scarves above their heads during the @entity4 clash at the @entity178 @entity32 had the next go , albeit a difficult chance , and saw his effort saved as he tried to dink the ball over @entity99 from a tight angle			1
@entity0 should have done much better with 10 minutes remaining , swiping a shot wide of the post from near the penalty and then substitute @entity37 saw his shot charged down in the last minute			2
although @entity1 was rarely troubled , this performance was not one to send fear into @entity191 's other big clubs			0
former @entity192 defender and current @entity194 captain @entity29 challenges @entity2 's @entity57 @entity0 almost scored again after just 60 seconds of the second half but could n't repeat his first - half feat @entity1 's Â£ 50million summer signing @entity30 chases @entity2 's @entity197 during the second half of the match @entity83 have had it easy - @entity168			1
