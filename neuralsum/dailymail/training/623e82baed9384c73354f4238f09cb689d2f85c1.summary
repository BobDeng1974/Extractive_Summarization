@entity0 admitted that he suspects the recent devastating floods across the country were the result of climate change			1
he was asked yesterday about the extreme weather over the @entity6 which saw 60mph winds , torrential rain and tidal waves that left eight people dead and hundreds of homes under water			2
but his comments at @entity15 ’s questions will infuriate some @entity17 backbenchers who do not accept global warming is affecting @entity20 ’s weather			2
the prime minister 's acknowledgement that climate change could be a factor behind the wild weather came as forecasters warned a @entity40 cold front could dump four inches of snow on the country and send temperatures as low as @entity44 next week			1
mr @entity0 was responding to a question from @entity47 president @entity46 , who said : ‘ the science is clear that the extreme weather conditions affecting our communities , including around the @entity53 estuary , are a destructive and inevitable consequence at least in part of climate change			1
‘ given that you have said this should be the greenest government ever , will you now agree to support carbon reduction targets so we can take real action to protect people and property ? ’ trying to make it through : a 4x4 drives down a flooded road next to the @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 destruction : the damaged promenade in @entity73 , @entity74			0
a major cleanup operation is now underway pledge : environment secretary @entity29 , who is regarded as a climate sceptic , has been under pressure over the government 's response to the floods the prime minister said , amid groans from his backbenches : ‘ i agree with you that we are seeing more abnormal weather events			1
‘ colleagues across the @entity88 can argue about whether that is linked to climate change or not			1
i very much suspect that it is			0
' the point is that whatever one ’s view , it makes sense to invest in flood defences			2
it makes sense to get information out better and we should do all of those things ’			0
on targets to slash carbon emissions , which some @entity17 mps say should be scaled back to reduce the burden on household energy bills , mr @entity0 said : ‘ this government is committed to carbon reduction targets			0
‘ we worked with the last government to put the @entity110 into place			0
' it would n’t have happened without our support			0
' we also have the @entity114 up and running in @entity115 and it ’s going to be investing billions of pounds in important green projects			0
’ climate scientists say no extreme weather event can be entirely blamed on the changing climate , but the impact of greenhouse gases on the planet makes extreme weather – such as floods and droughts – more common			2
december was the stormiest month since 1969 because of an unusually fierce jet stream , the band of fast - moving air which creates winter storms in the @entity130 and blows their remnants across the @entity132			0
in a typical winter , the jet stream travels at 100mph			0
this year it reached 230mph			0
the @entity135 predicts that wintry weather will replace the storms next week			2
spokesman @entity138 said : ‘ into the weekend and next week we are going to see temperatures return to normal levels for this time of year which will make it feel a lot colder and bring a risk of frost , fog , and wintry showers			2
’ bone breaker : a surfer near @entity150 in @entity151 comes to grief in the huge swell but some forecasters are predicting a blast of icy air from @entity40 after the weekend could bring up to four inches of snow the part of northern @entity20			1
temperatures could plummet to as low as -11c in the exposed north of the country and -6c as far south as @entity163 , according to some predictions			1
the dramatic change in the weather may be driven by a freezing front from the @entity168 moving steadily south over the next few days and meeting warmer , wetter air currently hovering over the @entity20			1
meanwhile , ministers have ordered a major review of the way the aftermath of the storms was handled , which will be presented to @entity175 within a month			0
it will also examine whether planned cuts to the budget of the @entity179 will undermine its ability to protect flood defences in future			1
millions of people across the south of @entity185 have been told to prepare for more flooding this week , with rivers in @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and the @entity195 on alert			1
getting around : a father and daughter paddle through flood water in a canoe in @entity201			2
the village had only just recovered from last year 's flooding there were 102 flood warnings and 181 flood alerts in place , although none of them were deemed severe , which would carry a danger to life			1
@entity25 has called on the government to publish a report by the end of this month giving a ‘ full assessment of the future capability of our flood defences and flood response agencies , and whether the investment plans in place are equal to the need for events of this kind ’			1
labour leader @entity24 said : ‘ some people felt the response time was too slow			0
’ he demanded to know ‘ why it took so long for the energy distribution companies to restore power to homes over the @entity232 period and what steps do you believe can be taken to ensure that kind of things does not happen again ’ .			0
