it 's normally @entity1 who triggers it , but this time it is @entity4 ’s doing			1
he played so well for @entity5 last weekend – again – that @entity7 ’s policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus			1
for the umpteenth time , the @entity10 and @entity11 are being urged to invoke the ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ get - out clause			1
there is an assumption in many quarters that , this being a @entity18 year , it is time to abandon all principles and do whatever it takes to ensure that every @entity21 , wherever he may be , is available for selection			0
well , here ’s an alternative suggestion			0
it is proving to be more hassle than it is worth			0
@entity11 , his assistants and his employers are being stalked by calls for @entity1 to be called into the national squad , as befitting his supreme exploits for @entity34			1
but that is to ignore the coaches ’ reservations , and the realisation that the fall - out from a shift in policy would have long - term repercussions			2
former @entity43 full back @entity4 was outstanding for @entity5 as they tore @entity44 to shreds @entity34 flanker @entity1 has been one of the standout forwards in @entity47 in recent seasons @entity49 director of rugby @entity50 believes the ' exceptional ' clause could cause major problems @entity7 hooker @entity54 also thinks the clause could create tension in the current international set - up this is not to decry a quality flanker who has excelled among the @entity61 at his club , but this situation can not go on			1
@entity7 are being held hostage by their own edict , so why not just ditch the ‘ exceptional ’ clause and end the out - cry ? critics of the union ’s stance over-look the consequences for the club game in this country if there is no restriction in place			1
this column concurs with @entity77 , who said : ‘ it is pure populism to say it is @entity18 year and we should do anything we can because the minute you break that ( policy ) , you break the dam			0
there are always exceptional circumstances			2
then there will be the next one and the next one and the next one			0
’ @entity91 ’s @entity7 hooker , @entity54 added : ‘ i do n’t know how well it would go down with the team			1
@entity11 has built a culture with this group of players			2
does he want to disrupt it ? ’ the ' exceptional ' clause rule has continued to heap pressure on @entity11 and his coaching staff fair point			1
tell players they have to stay to be considered , then at the 11th hour perform a u-turn and select exiles ; that is a short - cut to unrest , surely ? this is no restraint of trade either – those who wish to go abroad can do so freely , but the knock - on effect is clear			1
well , it is reasonably clear			0
it would be clearer still if the @entity10 and @entity7 really had the courage of their convictions and abolished the clause entirely			1
@entity117 ’s heavily - scrutinised conversion to rugby union will take an intriguing twist on friday night , when he starts at blindside flanker for @entity43 against @entity121 at @entity122			1
he has been striving to make an impact in midfield for four months , but his club ’s head coach , @entity125 , insisted long ago that back row would be his ultimate home			0
there are potential implications for @entity117 ’s quest to earn a place in @entity7 ’s @entity18 squad , as @entity134 sees him as a candidate to play at inside centre			1
@entity117 's rugby evolution continues on friday as he starts at blindside flanker against @entity121 however , despite widespread misgivings about the former league icon ’s exploits to date in his new code , he will be included in @entity7 ’s training squad announced next month , providing he is fit			1
in addition , any further doubts about @entity148 ’s health will further enhance @entity117 ’s prospects of making it to the @entity18 – as a powerful ball - carrier who can break tackles and off - load			2
the @entity7 coaches will back themselves to mould him to their vision , given three months to do so			1
finally , the back - row experiment makes sense			2
@entity117 needs the ball in his hands more , in order to make his presence felt , so wearing no 6 addresses that			0
when it comes to matchday atmosphere , the @entity165 is hard to beat it is well documented that @entity21 clubs can not compete with their @entity171 rivals when it comes to transfer - market clout , but they are also being eclipsed in the atmosphere stakes too			2
last weekend , the cacophony at @entity165 – for @entity5 vs @entity176 – was on a different level to anything experienced here			1
in this observer ’s opinion , the noise and colour at @entity181 the next day , as @entity182 took on holders @entity34 , was similar , if not quite as relentlessly raucous			1
many @entity186 grounds are full , but they lack the constant bedlam to be found in the best gallic arenas			0
the @entity189 when a big test is on takes some beating , while @entity192 , @entity193 , is the spiritual home of supporter fanaticism , closely followed by @entity195 when @entity196 play under lights			0
@entity199 's home stadium @entity192 is another fortress that generates a unique atmosphere but @entity5 lead the atmosphere league table			1
it ’s not necessarily a great place to go in support of doomed visitors , but those who have n’t been should try it as neutrals , for a big @entity171 top 14 clash			0
the place produces an epic occasion founded on fervent civic pride			0
@entity213 's struggles raise doubts when certain players go down in pain and require treatment on the field , there is a particular sense of foreboding			2
@entity222 is in that category			0
the @entity176 prop did n’t feature for @entity7 during the recent @entity225 and was forced off during the @entity226 ’ thumping defeat at @entity5 last weekend , apparently suffering discomfort in his right knee – which has been a problem area before			1
more recently , the @entity231 loosehead was laid low with a shoulder injury and he could be seen flexing that joint at @entity165			0
@entity222 has n’t started a test for @entity7 for 28 months			2
his club insist this latest setback is ‘ only a bruise ’ , but there will be grave doubts about this world - class player ’s ability to scale the heights again , until he plays regularly without mishap			2
@entity176 prop @entity222 has not started a game for @entity7 in nearly two years @entity226 and @entity7 lock @entity246 is a doubt for his side 's clash with @entity250 on sunday @entity246 has what @entity176 are calling a ‘ bad shoulder ’ and may not feature in sunday ’s clash with @entity250			1
there was better news for @entity44 on thursday , as @entity256 will be available for their @entity257 semi-final against @entity5 , after escaping with a one - match ban for striking @entity260 of @entity261			1
@entity262 now that he has been duly confirmed as one of the 12 referees appointed for the @entity18 , @entity263 should just go ahead and book his room in the @entity268 area for the final on october 31			0
the @entity270 is close to being a shoo - in for that showpiece occasion , unless his cause is shattered by @entity274 ’s national team emerging from the ‘ @entity275 ’ and going one step further than they did four years ago			0
it is no coincidence that @entity263 has presided over many of the greatest encounters at @entity281 and club level in recent years			0
@entity263 ( left ) is the frontrunner to referee the @entity18 final , unless @entity284 make it there of course his empathy , style of communication and desire to let the game flow mean he is respected worldwide			0
he has acquired a high profile , but it does nothing to detract from his professionalism			0
happily , this year ’s tournament can not be tarnished by the attention - seeking antics of @entity300 and @entity301 , who have both retired			0
referees are there to monitor , adjudicate and facilitate , not try to up - stage the teams and players .			2

@entity4 was *sublime* in @entity5 's *37* - 5 win against @entity176
@entity4 is *ineligible* for @entity7 because he is playing overseas
@entity34 flanker @entity1 is in the same *predicament*
the @entity10 can invoke an ' exceptional ' clause to select overseas players
but this clause could create tension in the @entity7 camp
