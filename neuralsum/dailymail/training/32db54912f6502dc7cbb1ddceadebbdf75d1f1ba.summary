@entity8 was established in october 2012 to hear appeals against parking charge notices which have been issued on private land in @entity41 and @entity42			1
the organisation mirrors the work of the @entity45 , which hears complaints from motorists issued with parking penalties on public roads			2

it revealed that they are now dealing with more than 600 appeals a week – with a total of 25,214 registered in 2013 - 2014			1
the report said one of the main reasons people contested their parking tickets was when they felt that car park signs were ‘ unclear , missing or confusing ’			1
and people also tended to complain after receiving an invalid ticket , or buying the right ticket but being accused of not properly displaying it on their windscreens			1
@entity8 spokesman @entity69 said : ‘ since my last report the number of cases being decided has grown substantially			2
the workload has increased some 12-fold			0
this sudden growth brought its own challenges			0

’ the parking on @entity86 service deals with contested tickets from car parks in places such as supermarkets , service stations and sports centres the @entity93 said the boom in the number of appeals lodged with @entity8 proved that parking regulations on private property had descended into a ‘ lottery ’			1
@entity93 spokesman @entity100 called for the government to regulate the private parking industry , and said loopholes which allow ‘ rogue ’ firms to overcharge motorists should be dealt with			2
speaking about the number of appeals that were rejected , he said : ‘ it is a bit disappointing that 55 per cent were refused			0
drivers will feel slightly grudging about that			0
’ he added : ‘ motorists still feel the lack of regulation means that it is a lottery			0
the government needs to do more to regulate it			0
‘ operators are going overboard on number plate recognition cameras and heavy - handed ticketing			0
i hope the appeal system is leading them to pull their socks up			0
the writing is on the wall for operators that blitz tickets			0
