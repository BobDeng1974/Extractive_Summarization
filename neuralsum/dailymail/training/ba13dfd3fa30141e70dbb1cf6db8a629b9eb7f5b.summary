by @entity0 published : 14:51 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 14:52 est , 16 july 2013 when @entity3 sat chatting to herself or swayed backwards and forwards , her friends assumed she was just drunk - again			1
but two years after she began acting strangely , she was diagnosed with a rare tumor on her pancreas that caused her blood sugar to drop , starving her brain and causing the ' drunk ' episodes			1
@entity9 , a 54 - year - old realtor from @entity10 , @entity11 , was originally diagnosed with hypoglycemia and went everywhere with snacks and juices to keep her blood sugar from dropping			1
she gained 25 pounds , but she saw that she had little choice			0
mystery : @entity3 , a 54 - year - old realtor , acted drunk for nearly two years due to a tumor that was producing too much insulin , causing her blood sugar levels to drop and starving her brain of fuel ' when my sugar would suddenly crash , it was like i was drunk , ' she told @entity25			1
' i would become very combative , not knowing what i was saying , and sway back and forth			0
' in one episode in @entity30 , she was sent home from work early because her colleagues thought she was drunk , @entity27 reported			0
shortly afterwards , she was driving with her husband but could not remember where they lived			0
she also forgot who the president was , and the year			0
the next thing she could remember , she was in her kitchen with two paramedics who were feeding her candy to keep her blood sugar up			1
discovery : dr @entity45 , left , found that @entity9 , right , had a tumor , even though she had been previously diagnosed with hypoglycemia			2
but even after this initial diagnosis and treatment , her episodes continued at this point , she was diagnosed with hypoglycemia and would regularly snack - but still , her blood sugar dropped and she found herself in the middle of her ' drunken ' episodes			1
@entity3 was diagnosed with insulinoma , a rare tumor on the pancreas which is made up of islets - cells which produce insulin			1
the body produces insulin in the presence of high blood sugar levels to reduce them			1
when sugar levels drop , the pancreas stops making insulin until the body has regulated the levels			1
but in @entity9 's case , the tumor meant she continued to make insulin even when her blood sugar level dropped too low			1
it meant that her blood stream was fast losing sugar needed for fuel for red blood cells , which carry oxygen throughout the body			2
without this fuel reaching the brain , it became starved and she started to become incoherent			0
' i 'd be having 3,000 different conversations with myself			0
it was scary , ' @entity9 told @entity27			0
' i thought there 's no way in hell i could live like this			0
' eventually having enough , she went to @entity89 , where dr @entity45 found her blood sugar levels were dangerously low			1
' a normal blood sugar is around 100 mg / dl , and most people start feeling poorly when their sugar dips below 70 , ' he said			1
' but @entity3 had a sugar of 20			2
' some sugar needs to stay in the blood stream			2
it acts as fuel for red blood cells			0
if the brain does n't get enough sugar you 're in real trouble			2
' he said that her levels were so low she was susceptible to seizures and slipping into a coma			2
she was diagnosed with @entity111 , a rare tumor on the pancreas that continues to make insulin even when the blood sugar level drops too low			1
the pancreas usually stops making insulin until the body has regulated its sugar levels			1
she was immediately referred to specialists at the @entity120 and underwent an ultrasound so doctors could find the tumor , which was one centimeter in diameter			2
savior : the tumor was removed at @entity120 in january and she has now recovered the tumor was safely removed in surgery and during the procedure , @entity9 had to be kept on a sugar iv drip to prevent her from having one of her episodes			0
@entity9 needed to stay in hospital for three days after the surgery , which was held in january , but has since returned home and is enjoying being free of her ' drunk ' episodes			0
she is now starting to lose the weight she piled on with all of her emergency sugary snacks			0
' for almost two years , i was n't living , ' she said			0
' they basically saved my life			0

@entity3 , 54 , would chat to herself , suffer memory loss and sway when her blood sugar levels dropped dangerously low
she was diagnosed with hypoglycemia but treatments did n't work
doctors eventually discovered she had a tumor that was producing insulin all the time , causing her blood sugar levels to *plummet*
