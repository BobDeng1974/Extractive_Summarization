@entity1 travellers today lampooned @entity3 's plans to offer £ 10 transatlantic flights by suggesting they may have to stand , pay to use the toilet or even parachute into @entity6 because it is so cheap			1
the budget airline has announced it plans to fly to @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 from @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 from 2020			1
the £ 10 - a - ticket proposal is part of a wider plan to change its image and ' stop p * * * * * * people off ' because boss @entity23 's schemes to squeeze more money out of passengers left many irate			1
breaking new ground : @entity3 's directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline offering flights from as little as £ 10 but there has also been considerable fun at their expense but despite a largely positive reaction online to the proposed transatlantic expansion , others have also used it to crack a joke at the frugal airline 's expense			1
some said that @entity3 's @entity9 hub could be in @entity43 , @entity44 , or passengers may have to ' sky dive in and hope you do n't land in the @entity48 ' so the thrifty company can avoid landing costs			1
others pondered how much people would be charged for not printing their own tickets , and if the £ 10 deal would include any food , leg room , entertainment or any luggage			1
@entity59 tweeted : ' it 's @entity3 so @entity9 means , at best , landing in @entity61			1
mail columnist @entity63 wrote : ' @entity3 to launch £ 10 flight to @entity6			1
plus £ 200 for luggage , £ 200 for seat , £ 1 to use loo '			0
@entity68 replied : ' they do n't actually land anywhere you just do a sky dive and hope you do n't land in the @entity48 '			0
the budget airline ’s directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline as part of an ambitious growth strategy at @entity79 ’s largest low - cost carrier over the next five years			1
the airline has set out proposals for one - way tickets costing from under £ 10 , although some fares would be much higher			1
@entity3 says it is studying plans to fly between about a dozen @entity79 and @entity6 cities on a transatlantic service that could start ‘ in four to five years ’			1
@entity3 ’s chief executive @entity86 has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline offering cheap ‘ ten buck ’ transatlantic fares – with $ 10 currently equivalent to £ 6.75			1
but the announcement that his board has now approved initial plans suggests the company is now more serious about going ahead with the ambitious strategy			0
@entity86 is particularly keen to win a slice of the lucrative long - haul transatlantic trade which is one of the most profitable routes in the world			0
the company said yesterday : ' @entity79 consumers want lower cost travel to the @entity6 and the same for @entity6 coming to @entity79			1
we see it as a logical development '			0
outspoken : mr @entity23 , who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth , has been the face of @entity3 for almost 20 years			2
he has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth but it is dominated by long - established @entity79 and @entity6 airlines including @entity113 , @entity114 and , on a smaller level , @entity116 , which is in partnership with @entity6 ’s @entity118			1
pay - per - pee in 2009 , mr @entity86 announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight			2
' we ’re thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny			0
' when asked if he would charge more than a pound , he replied : ' if someone wanted to pay £ 5 to go to the toilet i would carry them myself			2
i would wipe their bums for a fiver			0
' vertical seats a year later , the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats , akin to bar stools with seatbelts			0
his theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats , flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent			2
who needs co-pilots ? mr @entity23 once remarked that co-pilots were only there to ' make sure the first fella does n’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls '			0
he said aviation authorities should axe the ' unnecessary ' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as ' back - up ' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight			0
@entity3 ’s plan has echoes of 1970s cut - price pioneer sir @entity170 whose cheap @entity167 flights to the @entity6 transformed transatlantic travel for the masses , until it was effectively killed off by the established airlines , though it inspired sir @entity174 to launch @entity116			1
@entity1 started its transatlantic service in 2013 two years ago with a one - way ticket from the @entity177 to @entity9 starting at £ 149			2
@entity3 has said it would fulfil its long - expressed promise of offering some bargain - basement transatlantic fares at £ 10 , but other one - way tickets would be priced from £ 99 or more			1
in november @entity3 's profits soared by 32 per cent and its loud - mouth boss @entity23 admitted : ' being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy '			1
these have included demanding up to £ 5 to use the toilet and vertical seats to get more people on board			2
but last year , after two profits warnings , mr @entity23 's promised that the company would ' stop unnecessarily p * * * * * * people off ' and treating customers ' like the enemy '			0
@entity23 agreed to partially end the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £ 5 , relax the airline 's draconian baggage allowance rules and a ' sophisticated ' business service			2
he admitted that to turn them around he would end the airline 's ' over-abrupt ' , ' go to hell ' culture			0
in 2012 he launched an extraordinary rant against his own customers – branding those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘ idiots ’ who should ‘ b * * * * * off ’			0
her said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘ stupid ’ and it is right they are charged £ 60 a time to have one printed at the check - in desk because it is their ‘ f * * * up ’			2
budget : @entity3 ’s chief executive @entity86 has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline mr @entity23 , who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth , has been the face of @entity3 for almost 20 years			1
but in the past 18 month , under pressure over customer service , he has said he wants to change his ways			0
in @entity231 2013 a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon was bombarded on @entity233 after agreeing to host a question - and - answer session from customers			2
he posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets			0
many customers told mr @entity23 what an ' a * * * hole ' they thought he was - with user @entity242 asking him : ' have you by any chance just hired @entity247 's former head of publicity you @entity246 '			0
the @entity3 boss replied : ' hey , do n't call me plum			0
pudding would be more accurate ! ' , before later admitting : ' i 'm an a * * * hole			0
but they still love me			0

budget carrier plans to run services between @entity79 cities and the @entity6

@entity233 users have poked fun at plan because of @entity3 's thrifty reputation
some wondered if @entity9 hub would be in @entity44 or if plane would land
others mused that they may have to stand or pay to use the toilet en route
