the @entity0 paid out more than £ 228million to staff for working unsociable and unpredictable hours , fuelling worries it is wasting licence fee payers ' money			1
the revelation comes just a day after mps slammed the corporation for being profligate with public cash			0
documents released under the @entity9 show that thousands of @entity0 employees take home an average of almost £ 4,000 on top of their basic salaries , as a reward for working irregular hours			1
waste : the @entity0 paid out more than £ 228million to staff for working unsociable and unpredictable hours , a @entity9 request revealed they are allowed to claim a so - called ' flexibility ' or ' unpredictability ' allowance if they are asked to work on a scheduled day off , or start earlier or stay later than their timetabled hours			1
between the start of 2009 and the end of last year , the corporation lavished £ 187.4million on these payments , also known as ' alarm clock ' bonuses			1
and it dished out a further £ 41.7million of extra payments to staff working between midnight and 6am , to compensate for the inconvenience of working at antisocial times			0
in an average year , 7,941 @entity0 employees claimed £ 31.2million of unpredictability allowances , meaning they took home around £ 3,929 each			2
many workers make multiple claims , and in some cases staff are able to claim night pay and unpredictability allowances for the same shift – helping some @entity0 employees to bump up their salaries by a third			2
the corporation said that the lavish bonuses were necessary to keep the @entity0 's news operation going through the night			1
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' it 's impossible to broadcast 24 hours a day , seven days a week without employing people to work through the nights			1
scrapped : the @entity54 said the £ 145.50 @entity0 licence fee should be abolished by the end of the next decade slammed : the @entity58 select committee was scathing in its criticism of the @entity0 's approach to spending public money ' like most organisations we reflect this in our pay structure – however , we 're always looking to make savings and unpredictability allowance has come down by £ 4million since 2010			1
' he added : ' in that same period pay restraint , combined with headcount reductions , has to date saved the @entity0 £ 150million per year			2
' @entity71 have attacked the @entity0 for its ‘ shocking ’ decision to sell @entity73 to a firm they say was ‘ a tax avoidance scheme ’			0
in 2012 , the corporation sold its @entity79 headquarters to @entity80 , a consortium of businesses which channels its funds through @entity83			0
@entity84 , chairman of the @entity85 , asked @entity0 executives ‘ what on @entity89 ’ made them agree to the £ 200million deal			2
‘ this was clearly a tax avoidance scheme , ’ she said , adding : ‘ you are a public body and my view is when you dispose of what effectively are public assets there is a responsibility on you to ensure the people you deal with do not avoid tax			0
’ @entity100 , who became the @entity0 ’s finance chief after the deal , said the corporation had taken ‘ full legal advice ’ and concluded that @entity80 was not doing anything illegal			0
a spokesman for @entity107 , one of the firms involved in @entity109 , said the consortium was ‘ a perfectly lawful vehicle for transactions of this nature ’			0
however , mps branded the payments unnecessary			0
@entity116 , @entity116 mp for @entity117 , said : ' the @entity0 often unnecessarily puts someone in live situations when the story could be told just as well without doing that			1
' if it were n't paid by an effective poll tax , it might be different			0
the @entity0 tends not to be driven by the need to be efficient			1
' yesterday , the @entity58 select committee was scathing in its criticism of the @entity0 's approach to spending public money			1
in a major report entitled future of the @entity0 , it painted a devastating picture of an organisation that has blown millions of pounds trying to be ' all things to all people ' – including £ 100million on its failed @entity134 technology project			0
mps ordered the corporation to give the @entity138 unfettered access to its books , to ensure it does n't squander funds in future			0
but today 's revelations are unlikely to help restore confidence in the corporation 's spending habits			2
the committee also said that the £ 145.50 - a - year @entity0 licence fee should be scrapped by the end of the next decade , and replaced with a combination of a blanket household levy and a subscription fee for niche services			1
it also called for the abolition of the @entity154 , the organisation 's governing body , claiming it was ' too close ' to the corporation and ' blurred accountability ' .			0
