by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:08 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 25 april 2013 when these three walkers went up @entity4 , it was categorically a hill			2
by the time they came down , they were convinced it was a mountain ... and not just because their legs were tired			1
at 1,998ft , the @entity12 hill used to be just shy of the 2,000ft ( 609.6 metres ) required by @entity13 to be given mountain status			1
armed with gps technology , friends @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 worked out that it was in fact about three quarters of an inch over the limit , so it is actually 609.62m			2
@entity26 : @entity27 in the @entity28 has now been reclassified as a mountain after three ramblers measured it with @entity32 equipment mountain - makers : mr @entity18 , mr @entity17 and mr @entity16 on the summit of @entity27 @entity13 has since checked their data and confirmed it will amend its maps and listings to make @entity4 @entity40 ’s 254th mountain			1
their achievement has echoes of the 1995 @entity44 film @entity45			1
@entity44 ’s character , a cartographer , infuriates a @entity48 village by measuring their hill at just below mountain status			1
the villagers respond by building an earth cairn on the top to increase its height			2
rugged beauty : @entity57 is now @entity40 's 254th mountain peak : the view from the summit of @entity57			1
the trio 's data was corroborated by @entity13 mr @entity16 , 63 , and mr @entity17 , 62 , are retired research chemists from @entity63 and @entity64			2
together with mr @entity18 , a 53 - year - old former print firm manager who lives near @entity65 , they have measured more than 100 hills in @entity40 , @entity67 and @entity48 in five years , spending around £ 5,000 on @entity32 survey equipment			2
@entity57 is the second they have turned into a mountain			1
the first , in 2008 , was @entity74 ’s @entity73			0
mr @entity17 said : ‘ we have been keen hillwalkers for many years and we got talking about the height of some of the hills and modern gps technology available and decided to give surveying a go			0
’ they first walked up @entity4 , near the village of @entity83 , last august			0
after making their first measurement they returned last month to double check it and came up with an identical reading			0
@entity89 , of @entity13 , said : ‘ because the software that we have available is far better and [ more ] advanced than what they were using , we have been able to come up with a definitive answer and have been able to confirm their measurements			0
‘ their reading of 609.62m is to within two centimetres either way , which means at worst @entity27 is 2,000ft and it could even be an inch - and - a - half higher than that			0
before and after : the old os map ( left ) shows @entity57 at 609m tall , while it 's true height of 610m is displayed in the new one accurate : the men used gps equipment to measure the height of the mountain the group 's reading topped the magic mountain mark of 2,000ft by just three - quarters - of - an - inch intrepid : mr @entity17 and mr @entity16 on the ascent of @entity27 mr @entity17 added : ' we bought a surveyor 's level and staff to measure height differences and a @entity122 system that is essentially a big pole with an antennae on top			1
' generally , we look at maps and look for hills that are close to the 609 metre mark and then go and measure it			0
' we had @entity57 on our to - do list for some time , it was just a matter of meeting up and doing it			1
' ' it took us quite a while to find the absolute highest point of @entity27 , which we did by taking various readings			0
the summit is a patch a short grass and moss			0
' we were a bit cautious when we took the first measurement because there was only two centimetres in it			0
' after speaking to the @entity13 they advised us to go back and check it @entity147 returned six months later and found the summit to within 20 inches of our first visit			0
' in the film , villagers delay the cartographers ' departure while they build an earth cairn on top of the hill to make it high enough to be a mountain the film is set in 1917 and revolves around two @entity40 cartographers , @entity161 and his junior , @entity163 ( portrayed by @entity44 )			1
they arrive at the fictional @entity48 village of @entity166 ( translated as ' @entity167 ' or ' @entity168 ' in @entity48 ) to measure its ' mountain ' the village is horrified when the two men tell them it is merely a hill as it is just short of the required height			1
the villagers delay the cartographers ' departure while they build an earth cairn on top of the hill to make it high enough			2
it is based on a story heard by director @entity182 from his grandfather about the real village of @entity185 in @entity48 .			0

@entity57 has been *re-classified* thanks to three ramblers
*similar* to the plot of 1995 film @entity192 ...
it is the second hill the amateur trio have raised to mountain status
