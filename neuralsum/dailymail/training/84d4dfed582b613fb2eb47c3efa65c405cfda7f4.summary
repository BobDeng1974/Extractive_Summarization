it 's one of the most advanced robots under development by the @entity4 military			1
the cheetah , described as the ' @entity6 in the robotics world ' , could be used on the battlefield in just ten years , according to its creators			2
the stealthy machine can run faster than @entity11 , jumps 16 inches ( 40 cm ) and gallops for 15 minutes - all while using less power than a microwave			1
that includes powerful , lightweight motors ; electronics that control power for its 12 motors ; and an algorithm that determines the amount of force a leg should exert within a split second			1
this allows the machine to reach speeds of up to 30mph ( 48kph ) over difficult terrain			1
insight gleaned from the design of their prototype could have real - world applications , including the design of revolutionary prosthetics , wearable technologies and all - terrain wheelchairs			2
there are hopes the robot will be able to be used in search and rescue operations in hazardous or hostile environments where it 's too risky to send a human rescuer			1
the elegant machine can run faster than @entity11 , jumps 16 inches ( 40 cm ) high and gallops for 15 minutes the cheetah , described as the ' @entity6 in the robotics world ' , could be saving lives on the battlefield in just ten years , according to its creators			1
researcher @entity67 is shown here plugging batteries into the cheetah ' in the next 10 years , our goal is we are trying to make this robot to save a life , ' said @entity24 professor @entity75			1
' when the robot is running , at every step , we calculate the appropriate amount of the force to the legs so that the robot can balance itself , ' added @entity24 research scientist @entity83			1
sensors inside the robot measure the angle of the leg and that information is sent to an onboard computer that also organises data from the @entity91 which is also used to manoeuvre drones			0
the project is funded by the @entity4 @entity95 's @entity94 , who is developing a similar robot being alongside @entity98			2
the cheetah is @entity101 's fastest land animal , able to accelerate to 60 mph ( 96 kph ) in a few seconds speed and agility are hallmarks of the cheetah			2
the predator is the fastest land animal on @entity101 , able to accelerate to 60 mph ( 96 kph ) in just a few seconds			0
as it ramps up to top speed , a cheetah pumps its legs in tandem , bounding until it reaches a full gallop , the @entity24 team say - and their robo - cheetah can do the same the flexible spine , as well as unique leg muscles , give a cheetah 's legs abroad swing range , allow the animal to achieve a stride of 25 ft ( 7.6 metres )			1
the mit team say the act of running can be parsed into a number of biomechanically distinct gaits , from trotting and cantering to more dynamic bounding and galloping			0
in bounding , an animal 's front legs hit the ground together , followed by its hind legs , similar to the way that rabbits hop â€” a relatively simple gait that the researchers chose to model first			2
' bounding is like an entry - level high - speed gait , and galloping is the ultimate gait , ' @entity75 says			0
' once you get bounding , you can easily split the two legs and get galloping			0
' as a cheetah bounds , its legs touch the ground for a fraction of a second before cycling through the air again			2
the percentage of time a leg spends on the ground rather than in the air is referred to in biomechanics as a ' duty cycle ' ; the faster an animal runs , the shorter its duty cycle			0
' in the next 10 years , our goal is we are trying to make this robot to save a life , ' said @entity24 professor @entity75 , who is pictured here alongside a prototype of the robotic cheetah @entity24 researchers @entity165 , left , and @entity166 monitor the robotic cheetah during an early test run @entity24 scientists said the robot ( left ) , modeled after the fastest land animal , may have real - world applications , including the design of revolutionary prosthetics , wearable technologies and all - terrain wheelchairs			1
the machine could beat @entity11 ( right ) in a race the company says its version is powered by an off - board hydraulic pump and uses a boom - like device to keep it running in the centre of the treadmill			0
crafting the cheetah robot took five years of designing , testing , tweaking and plenty of confidence to ignore those who said electric motors are n't strong enough to propel a running mechanical cheetah powered by batteries			1
researchers had to exercise a lot of patience during test runs			0
the robot broke dozens of legs manufactured by @entity201 and reinforced with @entity203 strips and carbon fiber			0
strong , lightweight components make untethered running possible , including a carbon fiber - and - foam sandwich frame that can absorb the forces generated by running and jumping			0
some off - the - shelf components , including an xbox controller for manoeuvring the robot and wireless internet communications for sending commands , were also used			0
each leg is propelled by three motors that can generate powerful forces at slow speeds			2
still , researchers continue to tweak their prototype , looking to add additional sensors that would eventually make the robot autonomous			0

robo - cheetah jumps 16 inches ( 40cm ) and can gallop for 15 minutes
the stealthy military machines can reach speeds of @entity243 ( 48kph )
algorithm controls 12 motors that change amount of force legs exert
it may be used in hostile environments which are too risky for humans
@entity24 has been working with @entity4 military on a prototype for five years
