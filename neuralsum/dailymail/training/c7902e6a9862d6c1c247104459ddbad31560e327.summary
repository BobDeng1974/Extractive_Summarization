the company holds lucrative contracts to carry out investigative work for insurance companies			2
papers seen by the @entity18 reveal how staff are employed to watch covertly those who have lodged claims for the likes of critical injury cover to check they are not faking the extent of their condition			1
but the documents also reveal how it is ‘ usual practice ’ to send agents dressed as delivery men to knock on a claimant ’s front door while wearing secret cameras			1
they claim to have a parcel or other such item – which the person did not request – so they can film them at the door			1
@entity8 , which was widely condemned for its catastrophic failure to supply enough security guards for the @entity45 , said the tactic is known as the ‘ parcel pretext ’			1
it is now facing legal action from a disabled woman whose home was entered by one of its staff claiming to be delivering a clothing catalogue			2
the case has been taken up by civil rights group @entity57 , which accused @entity8 of ‘ oppressive and completely disproportionate ’ behaviour			1
mother - of - two @entity2 only discovered what had happened to her when she used data protection laws to ask for the information held on her file			2
couple : mrs @entity2 , who lives on @entity65 , @entity66 , with husband @entity67 , 43 , ( pictured ) and her daughters , suffers from various debilitating medical conditions such as arthritis and fibromyalgia mrs @entity2 , 38 , suffers from various debilitating medical conditions , including arthritis and fibromyalgia – a long - term condition that causes pain all over the body			2
her disability prevents her from working and in early 2011 she made a claim on her @entity81 critical injury insurance policy			2
@entity81 , which disputes the extent of her disability , responded by engaging covert surveillance experts the @entity84 – now a division of @entity8 – to investigate her circumstances			1
mrs @entity2 , who lives on @entity65 , @entity66 , with husband @entity67 , 43 , and daughters @entity87 , 17 , and @entity88 , 11 , said : ‘ @entity81 had already sent out a medical examiner , which i knew – but i have since discovered that while he was doing my report , the surveillance started in november 2011			2
‘ when i applied under the @entity93 to see what they had got , i found they had videoed my mother - in - law taking me to the supermarket			2
there ’s hardly any footage of me in it			0
‘ but then i saw that during several days of surveillance outside , they had also come into my house – and had a picture of me on my sofa			0
‘ i could barely remember it , but they had knocked on my door with a parcel for me and wanted me to sign for it			0
my husband told them i could n’t move , and said they would have to come in			0
they came into the living room , i signed it , and they left			0
surveillance video : @entity81 , which disputes the extent of her disability , engaged covert surveillance experts the @entity84 - now a division of @entity8 - to investigate her circumstances filming : this surveillance video showed mrs @entity2 , who has arthritis , shopping in a @entity126 store ‘ it was only when i got the report that i found it what had been going on			1
i only took out my insurance for the sake of my children			0
now i feel like i signed a deal with the devil			0
’ @entity81 refused to pay out on mrs @entity2 ’s claim , which she is challenging through the financial ombudsman			0
' i was absolutely devastated			0
i only took out my insurance for the sake of my children			0
now i feel like i signed a deal with the devil ' @entity2 she is also demanding an apology and explanation from @entity8 for the invasion of her home			1
if that fails , she will sue them for damages in court in a bid to embarrass them and stop similar techniques by other firms			0
lawyers insist the company ’s actions were illegal and @entity57 is pursuing the case on her behalf			0
but @entity8 says it has done nothing wrong and was merely pursuing normal procedures – raising the prospect of thousands more people being subjected to the same intrusive tactics			1
@entity162 , legal officer for @entity57 , said : ‘ of course insurance companies need protection from bogus claims , but that should n’t mean riding roughshod over people ’s privacy			0
investigation : her disability prevents her from working and in early 2011 she made a claim on her @entity81 critical injury insurance policy ‘ @entity8 tricked their way into a disabled woman ’s home – which was oppressive and completely disproportionate			1
‘ given the power and influence of this company is ever increasing , should n’t they have a better grasp of the law ? ’ ' @entity8 tricked their way into a disabled woman ’s home – which was oppressive and completely disproportionate			1
given the power and influence of this company is ever increasing , should n’t they have a better grasp of the law ? ' @entity162 , @entity57 both @entity191 and @entity8 boast that surveillance is ‘ conducted in line with the principles of the @entity195 ’			1
in fact , the @entity93 makes it clear that any uninvited activity inside a private home is ‘ intrusive surveillance ’ that would require official authorisation			0
in a letter to mrs @entity2 , @entity8 director of investigations @entity202 said it was ‘ usual practice ’ to carry out a ‘ positive identification ’ of the person under surveillance and there were several ways this could be done			1
‘ in this particular case the field operative decided to use a parcel pretext			0
this entails a parcel delivery that is signed by the party concerned , supported if possible by covert film			1
this is acceptable practice , ’ he said .			0
