by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity2 has written a song to teach children not to go to @entity5 unless it is a real emergency			1
schools are being urged to teach the lyrics as part of a campaign fronted by a knitted monkey to ease the pressure on casualty departments			0
one million more people visited @entity5 last year compared to 3 years ago , and officials claim that if one child from every school wen to their gp instead they it would save £ 1.4million			1
the toy monkey is being used by the @entity2 to educated children about what it is like to go to hospital , and the alternatives when it is not a real emergency a kit has been sent to every primary school in @entity29 to help teach children about the structure of the health service			1
the @entity2 hopes youngsters will succeed where politicians and doctors have failed , and persuade their parents to consider alternatives to rushing to @entity5			1
it follows successful campaigns on recycling and road safety , where adults came under pressure to change their behaviour after being nagged by their children			2
the ‘ @entity47 ’ has been produced for the @entity2 by primary school teacher @entity46			2
it includes puppets , dvds , posters , stories , stickers and a song to educate children about different @entity2 services			1
children who remember the difference between a walk - in centre and a pharmacy are given an @entity62 badge			0
a series of slides presents different health scenarios and asks children to consider whether they would need to go to @entity5 it is claimed that if one child from every primary school does not go to @entity5 as a result of the packs , it would save the @entity2 £ 1.4million an evaluation of the packs produced earlier this year shows that the song in particular has proved a hit with pupils			1
the lyrics include : ‘ when monkey ’s feeling poorly or gets an injury / he does n’t have to swing straight to @entity83 and @entity84 / there are lots of friendly people in the @entity2 / so here ’s a monkey song to help you choose what ’s best			0
’ there are also slides which show the monkey with different ailments , and the children have to decide where best to seek treatment			0
it includes having a headache , being bullied , feeling sick and having a crayon stuck up his nose			0
organisers of the scheme claim : ‘ if the pack can prevent one child from each of the @entity107 in @entity29 from visiting an @entity5 unnecessarily then the @entity2 could save £ 1.4 million			1
’ reducing the number of people who turn up at @entity5 with non-emergencies has become a major political issue			2
@entity114 and @entity115 have repeatedly clashed in the @entity116 on waiting times to be seen			0
the prime minister said last week : ‘ of course more people are going to a and @entity84 departments in our country — over a million more people — but we are meeting our targets , and waiting times are down by a half			0
’ however , patient groups are unimpressed by the attempt to use children to cojole their parents into using different @entity2 services			0
@entity132 , co-director of @entity133 , told @entity134 : ' do n’t try to put children in charge of when it is necessary to use public services like @entity5			2
' when monkey ’s feeling poorly or gets an injury , he does n’t have to swing straight to @entity83 and @entity84 there are lots of friendly people in the @entity2 , so here ’s a monkey song to help you choose what ’s best @entity149 try a. ... grown up , pharmacist , helpline , gp , school nurse , @entity153 , out of hours surgery on - line , walk in , 999 , @entity5 , @entity140 , here to help you through monkey , knows just what to do , @entity140 , always there for you monkey if you ’ve got the sniffles or a little scrape , do n’t go bananas and do n’t go ape talk to a grown - up or your school nurse , they ’ll help you out so it does n’t get worse if you ’re monkey puzzled and still feel unwell , you can give the helpline a little bell they ’ll listen hard to what you have to say , or look online at @entity174 @entity149 monkey sometimes goes to see the jungle gp , he knows little monkey and his family but out of office hours , if @entity140 ’s sick up in his tree , go to the walk in centre or out of hours @entity152 if someone has an accident or is really really sick , do n’t monkey around - you need to act quick if you need an ambulance , move quick call 999 , or go to @entity5 and you ’ll be seen on time ! @entity149 monkey tries to stay healthy , he eats his 5 a day , his paws are clean , he ’s really keen to keep the germs away he like swinging in the trees , oh it ’s great to run and play , an apple - or banana – help to keep the @entity198 away so be happy and be active and you ’ll stay very well , but sometimes we ’re all poorly and we feel unwell there are lots of friendly people in the @entity2 , but staying fit and healthy is what everyone likes best !			1
