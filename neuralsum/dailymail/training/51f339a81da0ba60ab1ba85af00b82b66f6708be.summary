an @entity1 artist has created stunning colourful representations showing what @entity4 waves , peaks and pulses would look like if we could see them			1
@entity10 worked with former @entity12 astrobiologist @entity11 to learn how the networks move and based the designs on coverage data taken from around the @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18			1
the images show the shape of the @entity4 signal 's and different colours were used to distinguish the different sub channels			2
the project was a follow - up to @entity10 's @entity4 visualisations released last year which depicted the shape of the @entity4 signals			2
the @entity4 pulses are shown here as spheres			1
@entity10 used red , orange , yellow and other colours to represent these invisible channels that make up the overall @entity4 signal @entity4 routers on buildings and lamp posts create a circular omnidirectional data fields around them , pictured			1
@entity4 broadcasts at a frequency between radio and microwaves , meaning that the waves or pulses are about six inches apart , as shown by these coloured bands in front of @entity16 @entity4 is an energy field that is transmitted as waves and pulses			1
each wave has a certain height , are different distances from each other , and each travel at a certain speed			0
the distance between @entity4 waves is shorter than radio waves but longer than microwaves			1
as well as looking great , the illustrations were also designed to teach people about how @entity4 signals work			1
@entity10 , from website @entity65 , said : ' although we use it often , we rarely think about how it works			0
' a lot of us take technology for granted and use it without appreciating the science that makes it work			0
' to approximate the size of the @entity4 coverage around @entity17 - an open - area national park in @entity76 used the @entity78 shapes and data from the @entity81 coverage maps			1
the captions were written by @entity11 , a ph.d. in astrobiology who previously worked at @entity86 for five years and now teaches science			0
each picture shows a familiar @entity18 landmark surrounded by @entity4 channels represented as different colours , as ' interlocking bubbles '			2
@entity10 then added a hazy effect to areas of the signal broken by a tree , landmark or other obstacle			0
@entity4 uses the radio frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between radio waves and microwaves			1
according to @entity104 , the @entity103 will have a severe shortage of airwaves used for @entity4 by 2020 a typical outdoor router can project its @entity4 signal 300ft or more from its location			0
objects such as trees can obstruct this signal and the waves are often boosted by using multiple routers			0
this kind of set up creates a field that extends all the way across @entity76 's @entity17 , pictured @entity4 waves travel as rapid , data encoded pulses or waves			1
a freezeframe of these pulses are shown by the lightly coloured bands in this image in another of his images , multiple @entity4 pulse frequencies are represented as blue , green , yellow , and red that pervade the space around the mall			1
in a third , @entity10 showed the range of multiple @entity4 signals across @entity17 in @entity18			0
writing on his @entity65 blog , @entity10 said : ' we use red , orange , yellow and other colors [ sic ] to show the invisible @entity4 channels that make up the overall signal			0
' @entity4 fields are usually spherical or ellipsoidal and extend about 20 - 30 meters [ sic ] , assuming a typical off the shelf box			0
' @entity4 is an energy field that is transmitted as waves			2
each wave has a certain height , distance from other waves , and they each travel at a certain speed			0
the distance between @entity4 waves is shorter than radio waves but longer than microwaves			2
@entity10 claims this gives @entity4 a unique transmission band that ca n't be interrupted by other signals .			0

artist used @entity4 coverage data taken from networks in @entity76
he created colourful representations showing waves , peaks and pulses
the work was carried out with help from a @entity12 astrobiologist
