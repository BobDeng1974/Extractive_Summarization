by @entity1 reporter published : 05:05 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 12:58 est , 13 june 2012 @entity2 has called for the @entity3 to enforce envoy @entity5 's six - point peace plan for @entity6 - in a move which could see force used against @entity10 's regime			1
foreign minister @entity11 said he was hoping that @entity12 , a key ally of @entity6 , would agree to invoking the @entity3 's @entity13 to make it happen			1
it allows the use of military force			0
the first stage could be to impose a @entity18 and allow humanitarian aid into the country			0
but , as seen in other conflicts , could escalate to more drastic action if the regime does n't bend to international demands			0
and echoing @entity3 peacekeeping chief @entity27 's comments yesterday , he said the @entity6 conflict was now a ' civil war '			1
plea : @entity2 's foreign minister @entity11 ( left ) wants the @entity3 to make @entity5 's ( right ) peace plan obligatory he said : ' we propose making the implementation of the @entity5 plan compulsory			1
' we need to pass to the next speed at the @entity36 and place the @entity5 plan under @entity13 - that is to say make it compulsory under pain of very heavy sanctions			0
' @entity2 would propose toughening sanctions on @entity6 at the next meeting of @entity46 foreign ministers , he added			1
and the international community would prepare a list of second - ranking military officials who would be pursued by international justice , alongside president @entity10 and his immediate entourage			2
he said : ' they must understand that the only future is in resisting oppression			0
the time for taking a decision has arrived			0
they have to jump ship			0
' earlier today @entity6 troops claimed to have won a bloody eight - day battle to regain control of a crucial rebel mountain - top hide - out - with the help of @entity12 attack helicopters			1
troubled : @entity3 peacekeeping chief @entity27 ( left ) said @entity6 was now in a full - scale civil war between president @entity10 's ( right ) troops and rebel soldiers state television boasted that forces loyal to brutal dictator @entity10 had ' cleared terrorist fighters ' from the town of @entity73			1
it came after more than a week of heavy fighting which led the @entity76 to warn that a potential massacre would soon take place there			2
newsreaders said the troops had ' restored calm and security in @entity73 ' after they ' cleansed it of armed terrorist groups ' - a term authorities use to describe rebels fighting @entity10			2
the @entity12 helicopters are thought to be old ones and not the new batch referred to by @entity76 secretary of state @entity89 yesterday			1
she said @entity91 was worried @entity12 may be sending attack helicopters to @entity6			1
it prompted @entity12 's foreign minister to today defend his country 's sale of arms to @entity6 and accuse the @entity76 of supplying rebels with weapons to fight against the government			1
' we are not violating any international law in performing these contracts , ' said @entity104 , in response to a question about @entity108 's comments at a news conference during a visit to @entity111			1
' they are providing arms and weapons to the @entity6 opposition that can be used in fighting against the @entity117 government , ' he said on @entity111 state television			2
demanding change : demonstrators in @entity121 , near @entity122 hold a placard ( left ) that reads : ' are you dumb ? is there any sane person who really believes there could be a peaceful solution ? ' @entity12 is one of @entity6 's principal defenders on the diplomatic front and , as a permanent member of the @entity36 with the power to veto resolutions , has stymied efforts by @entity138 powers to pressure president @entity10 into stepping down			1
@entity104 said @entity12 's position was based on concern for the @entity6 people and the country 's integrity , rather than personal preference for @entity10			1
' i have announced time and again that our stance is not based on support for @entity10 or anyone else ... we do n't want to see @entity6 disintegrate			1
' @entity12 is resisting @entity138 and @entity153 @entity152 pressure to take a harder line against @entity10 , rejecting calls for sanctions and proposing a conference bringing together global and regional powers including @entity111			1
@entity111 foreign minister @entity159 said the @entity6 crisis could not be resolved by external powers			1
' the @entity162 of @entity111 has announced many times : the issue of @entity6 needs to be dealt with in @entity6 by @entity6 , not through the interference of others			2
' the @entity76 says it does not believe @entity111 , @entity10 's closest regional ally , is ready to play a constructive role in @entity6 , where the @entity3 says government forces have killed more than 10,000 people since march 2011			1
last night the @entity3 said that violence in @entity6 has escalated so much in the last five days that the country is now in a state of full - scale civil war			1
conflict continues : an image grab taken from a video uploaded on @entity178 on monday shows smoke billowing from the flashpoint @entity6 city of @entity181 which activists said was being attacked by regime forces the organisation 's chief peacekeepers has admitted for the first time that the bloodshed between president @entity10 's troops and rebels has reached unprecedented levels			1
@entity27 , when asked if the @entity6 conflict has escalated into civil war , replied : ' yes , i think one can say that '			1
@entity3 observers have seen a steep rise in violence and a dangerous shift in tactics by both sides in @entity6 in the last five days , his spokesman @entity194 added			1
the @entity6 government , intent on wresting back control of rebel - held areas , is shelling heavily populated districts and using attack helicopters over cities ' with devastating impact on civilians , ' @entity194 said			2
the opposition , in turn , is increasingly coordinating attacks against government forces and civilian infrastructure , and ' the conflict has reached all parts of @entity6 virtually , ' he added			2
he also revealed that @entity3 observers have been prevented from entering besieged rebel - held towns			2
they were pelted with stones , metal rods and gunfire as they tried to reach @entity225 , where civilians were feared trapped by government shelling			0
the observers were not hurt as they were turned back by the assault on their vehicles yesterday			0
but other areas have also been blocked to their colleagues			0
' grave violations ' : the @entity3 report says government forces have been using children as shields while attacking , torturing and killing residents during the 15 - month crackdown on protesters last week , it took days for the monitors to reach @entity243 , where nearly 80 people were reportedly killed , because government troops and residents blocked them			2
as the conflict deteriorates into a murderous grind , regional power brokers from @entity111 to @entity248 risk getting drawn into the fight			0
the @entity3 's special envoy on @entity6 , @entity5 , asked governments with influence to ' twist arms ' to end the bloodshed			1
but there are few signs the diplomatic pressure is having any measurable effect			0
' the longer this violence continues , the more dangerous it becomes not only for the country and the @entity6 people but the region , ' @entity5 's spokesman , @entity261 , told reporters in @entity268			2
' it 's dangerous and the red light is flashing			0
' the deteriorating situation in @entity272 has raised alarm in the past eight days , and @entity91 had said on monday that regime forces may be preparing a massacre in the village , which is about 20 miles from @entity10 's hometown of @entity278 in @entity280 province along the @entity282 coast			1
activists said government forces were firing mortar rounds into the village			0
calls to the area did not go through yesterday			0
the government restricts journalists from moving freely , making it nearly impossible to independently verify accounts from either side			0
violence has escalated significantly in recent days as the government fights to reassert control of pockets of resistance across the country			0
outrage : mourners attend a mass burial in @entity6 for more than 100 people , half of whom were children , killed in a massacre in the city of @entity307 last month @entity6 forces fired mortars at protesters yesterday in the eastern city of @entity313 , killing at least 10 people , activists said			2
clashes also were reported in central @entity181 province			0
amateur video of the mortar attack on @entity313 showed some of the dead in a street as survivors screamed in panic and tried to remove their bodies			0
other videos showed some of the wounded being treated at a hospital			0
the state news agency @entity328 blamed the @entity225 violence on terrorists - the term it uses to describe rebels - who had attacked residents in the village			0
the report also said a reporter and a cameraman for the pro-government @entity338 were wounded when bullets hit their car in @entity272 on monday			0
throughout the uprising , violence has rattled @entity280 , an area of profound importance to the regime			0
latakia province is the heartland of the @entity349 minority to which @entity10 and the ruling elite belong , although there is a mix of religious groups			2
@entity6 's @entity355 majority makes up the backbone of the opposition , and minorities such as @entity349 and @entity359 have generally stuck to the sidelines , in part out of fears that they will be marginalized - or even face retribution - if @entity355 take over			2
international attention : @entity3 observers view bodies at a hospital morgue before the burial of the @entity307 dead as the violence worsens , world powers have struggled to find ways to end the bloodshed			2
@entity5 brokered a peace plan that was supposed to go into effect april 12 but never took hold			1
more than 13,000 people have died in @entity10 's crackdown on the uprising that began in march 2011 as part of the @entity381 , according to activist groups			1
@entity5 renewed calls yesterday for the bloodshed to end			0
' it is totally unacceptable and it must stop , ' spokesman @entity261 said , ' and that is why @entity5 has invited governments with influence to raise the bar to another level , to the highest level possible , and twist arms if necessary , to get the parties to implement the plan			0
' he did n't specify the countries that might still have leverage with the @entity10 regime , but @entity12 , @entity399 and @entity111 are @entity6 's closest and strongest allies			1
@entity261 said it was up to the government to take the first step to end the violence			0
' the stronger party should send a strong signal in good faith and stop the violence , and the stronger party in this case is clearly the government of @entity6 , ' he said .			0

@entity2 foreign minister hopes @entity12 will agree to invoking @entity3 's @entity412 . 7
it allows the use of force to impose a peace plan on @entity10 's brutal regime
echoes @entity3 peacekeeping chief 's comments that @entity6 now in ' civil war '
@entity89 had said she was worried @entity12 was sending helicopters
