radio presenter @entity0 has revealed she was left ‘ upset ’ after watching hardcore pornography in preparation for the @entity5 show ’s latest debate as the host of @entity7 , @entity0 has chaired discussions on harrowing topics ranging from rape to domestic abuse			1
but despite her experience , the presenter has revealed she was left ‘ upset ’ after watching hours of hardcore pornography in preparation for the @entity5 show ’s latest debate			1
the mother - of - two , 50 , said she may have been ‘ naïve ’ but was shocked by the way women were treated in the explicit clips , with many looking like they were in pain			1
she also raised concerns that pornography is ‘ no longer limited to the top shelf ’ as it was in her own childhood but has become easily accessible as ‘ erotica has gone mainstream			1
’ speaking during the debate ‘ can porn @entity28 ? ’ , miss @entity0 said : ‘ i have to say i spent an informative hour or so last week watching porn at work			1
i do n’t want to miss @entity32			0
‘ when i watched it last week , if i am really honest with you , i am probably a bit naïve and vanilla in my taste , i do n’t think upset is too strong a word , but i was upset by the expressions of some of the women			1
i do not want to watch women in pain			1
i do n’t get why i should be expected to get that			0
why should i ? ’ other members of the panel , which included sex workers , defended pornography , claiming that not all porn is the same and that it can empower both men and women			1
miss @entity0 , who divorced television presenter @entity53 , 47 , in 2009 , said access to pornography has changed since her childhood and that she worries what impact this could have on society			1
she said : ‘ when i was a child you might find a school friend ’s dad ’s copy of @entity64 in his bedroom and have a blooming good look and be slightly amazed and a bit stunned and a bit baffled if you were me			2
it was not everywhere and now it is			0
it was not so easily accessible			0
surely that has made a difference ? ’ statistics published by pornographic website @entity75 suggest that pornographic influences are having on how people view sex and relationships			2
since the release of the @entity84 film , the site has seen a spike in searches for explicit videos about ‘ domination ’ of 55 percent among men and 40 percent among women			1
psychotherapist @entity91 , 68 , author of books such as @entity93 is a @entity94 and what do women want ? , agreed that what was once seen as pornography is now mainstream			2
she said : ‘ i think there is porn in every women ’s magazine			1
in @entity104 and @entity105 , we represent girls as if though they are always ready for it			0
that is a very interesting way of representing femininity and women			2
what used to be on the top shelf is now in every magazine and it is constructing a different relationship for girls in terms of their own bodies			0
’ since the release of the @entity84 film , @entity75 has seen a spike in searches for explicit videos about ‘ domination ’ of 55 percent among men and 40 percent among women other panellists were keen to defend pornography			1
@entity129 , 29 , who describes herself as a feminist porn performer , said it is wrong to tar all explicit videos and images with the same brush			1
miss @entity129 , who runs a website called @entity136 and posts pictures on @entity138 of bare bottoms that have been caned until they are bleeding , said : ‘ @entity141 is not a genre			2
it is a medium like film or television			0
saying it is degrading is like saying all of tv is degrading just because you have watched @entity149			0
i would say do n’t throw the baby out with the bath water			0
there is a growing number of feminist porn directors making the porn they want to see			2
it is a huge business and it is happening now			0
‘ i have produced porn for nine years			1
i have a creative vision that i want to get out there			0
it gives me body confidence and financial independence			0
we should not be judging porn on whether it empowers women as capitalism is degrading as you have to exchange your labour for money			1
’ to those who said the internet was to full of pornography that they would rather not see , she replied : ‘ you can scroll past			1
the internet is like that			0
the women choose to be there			2
they would rather be there than washing dishes or cleaning toilets			0
’ however , this was not enough for sex shop founder @entity185 , 43 , who said the modern pornography industry , and the morals it teaches are sex and relationships , is damaging for everyone			2
she said : ‘ i am worried what is happening now			2
there is too much profit engineering now			0
i believe the porn industry is unregulated			0
this is not just un-powering to women but un-powering to us all			0
’ ‘ as the industry stands i do n’t believe it holds women in a safe place			1
i can make my own home erotica and give it to my friends freely but if there is a mechanism of money behind it lets question it and let ’s change it			0
that is what we need to do			0
’ the debate , which was recorded at the weekend , will be broadcast in an edited version on sunday march 8 to mark @entity214 .			1
