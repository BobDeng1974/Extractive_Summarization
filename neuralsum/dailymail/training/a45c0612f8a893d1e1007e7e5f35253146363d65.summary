by @entity0 the ‘ patronising ’ advert highlighting @entity4 cuts to bingo and beer duty that conservative chairman @entity6 has been heavily criticised over was actually signed off chancellor @entity7 , it is claimed			1
mr @entity6 suffered a ferocious backlash on @entity9 after posting the advert in an apparent bid to woo working - class voters			1
but @entity14 @entity13 have claimed the advert was designed in the @entity16 and the chairman has been left to take the blame			1
blame game : @entity13 claim that @entity14 chairman @entity6 has been left to take the fall for the controversial poster , which chancellor @entity7 signed off , it is claimed ' pr disaster ' : @entity6 tweeted this @entity14 advert about beer and bingo cuts in today 's budget the @entity14 advert read : ‘ bingo ! cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy			1
’ critics said the message reinforced public perceptions that the @entity14 was out of touch with ordinary voters			2
government sources stressed that responsibility for the advert lay with mr @entity6 rather than the @entity16 or no 10			1
some @entity14 @entity13 said the advert – which sparked dozens of internet spoofs – raised questions about mr @entity6 ’s ‘ suitability ’ for the job			1
one told the @entity54 : ' they could easily have defended him and said that it was a team effort , which it was			0
' another said mr @entity6 had kept quiet for fear of offending the chancellor , adding : i 'm not @entity6 's greatest fan but he has been treated pretty shabbily			1
' the newspaper reported that a small team from @entity64 went to the treasury to develop the ad with the chancellor 's aides and it was signed off by @entity69 , the @entity14 election strategist , the prime minister 's political secretary @entity71 and mr @entity7			1
a spokesman for the @entity14 refused to comment			2
after the furore , @entity74 insisted @entity76 had ‘ full confidence ’ in his party chairman , adding : ‘ he thinks he ’s doing a good job			1
’ but one senior @entity14 said : ‘ when i saw this advert my initial thought was that it must be a spoof			1
my reaction when i realised it was n’t was one of abject horror			0
’ another exasperated conservative mp said : ‘ has it boiled down to this ? a @entity6 beer and bingo poster ? @entity90 help us			1
it ’s like they want us to lose			0
’ mr @entity6 urged @entity14 supporters to ‘ spread the word ’			1
one @entity14 source yesterday said the advert had been ‘ pulled ’ and would never be used again			1
but a @entity14 spokesman insisted it had only ever been intended for use on the internet and was never planned as a poster campaign			2
the spokesman said : ‘ we are quite proud of those tax cuts			1
we stand by what was said in that advert			0
‘ there is a misconception about it – it was never going to be a poster campaign , it was just an internet infographic			0
‘ some of the left - wing intelligentsia may not like it but the reaction in bingo halls to the tax cut has been very positive			2
’ @entity119 @entity120 treasury chief secretary @entity120 described the wording of the advert as ‘ pretty patronising ’ and said it ‘ demeans some quite sensible things ’			0
@entity125 added : ‘ i think the tweet was a bit silly , partly because the issues involved in this budget were really quite serious			0
’ @entity131 mayor @entity130 also declined to support the advert			0
‘ i did n’t write the blooming thing , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re trying to get across the message that it ’s a budget for everyone			0
’ shadow chancellor @entity137 said @entity7 must be ‘ frustrated that his head of campaigns puts out an advert patronising working people by saying they ’ll be happy with a bingo tax and a beer tax			1
what nonsense that is ’			0
@entity147 , a writer on political satire @entity148 , said the ad was beyond satire but mr @entity7 dismissed the row , saying it had been ‘ whipped up by the @entity51 ’ to disguise the fact they had nothing to say about the @entity4			2
mr @entity7 said he had played bingo			2
the prime minister ’s spokesman said he did not know when mr @entity76 had last played bingo – or if he had ever played it at all			0
however , he is known to enjoy a pint of real ale			0
the internet was last night awash with spoof versions of mr @entity6 ’s advert , which mock it for stereotyping the working class			2
one posted on @entity9 reads : ‘ bingo ! no tax on pies , flat caps or whippets – keeping our commitment to patronise the working class			0
now get off my land			0
’ another says : ‘ bingo ! i say , you there ! how is your whippet ? jolly good , jolly good			0

party chairman @entity6 tweeted beer and bingo tax cuts advert

@entity189 was immediately slammed as a ' pr disaster ' and ' ill - conceived '
some @entity14 *mps* said advert raised questions about his ' suitability ' for job
but others say he 's been blamed *unfairly* - and @entity7 *approved* of poster
