by @entity1 reporter a woman visiting her mother in @entity4 is suing her neighbor and seeking $ 275,000 for pain , suffering and other damages that she says were inflicted when a pet duck ambushed her for no apparent reason			1
@entity10 , 62 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , was on her mother 's property in @entity15 , @entity4 , about 25 miles southeast of @entity16 , when a neighbor 's duck attacked her without warning			1
according to the suit filed in @entity4 state court last friday , in her attempt to run away from the agitated swan , @entity10 fell to the ground , breaking her right wrist and spraining an elbow and shoulder			1
the complaint accuses the bird 's owner , @entity39 , of failing to maintain control of her pet or ' to warn or otherwise inform neighbors of her duck 's dangerous propensity in attacking individuals			1
' @entity10 , a retired nurse , is seeking up to $ 275,000 in damages , including roughly $ 25,000 for medical expenses , with the remainder being for pain , suffering and the toll her injuries have taken on her daily life			0
' these injuries , some of which may be permanent in nature , have caused her , and continue to cause her pain , suffering , inconvenience , humiliation and interfere with [ her ] normal and usual activities and have caused her permanent scarring all to her noneconomic damage in an amount to be determined by a jury , but are currently estimated not to exceed $ 250,000 , ' the lawsuit @entity56 said she has about $ 25,000 in medical bills so far because of her injuries			0
the lawsuit claims @entity39 should â€™ve known that the duck could be violent , and that the @entity4 woman should be on the hook for negligence and the medical bills			2
duck face : @entity10 says a duck ( not pictured ) caused her to fall , leading her to file a negligence lawsuit against the duck 's owner ' as the possessor of a domestic animal that the defendant knew , or had reason to know , had abnormally dangerous propensities in attacking people in an aggressive manner similar to how it attacked and injured mrs. @entity10 , defendant is strictly liable for all injuries her duck caused mrs. @entity10 ' the suit goes on to say			1
@entity10 's lawyer , @entity92 , said it was his understanding that @entity39 had her duck killed after the incident			2
@entity39 could not be reached for comment on the case			0
@entity92 said he expects the damages will ultimately be paid by @entity39 's insurance policy , but filing a lawsuit was necessary as a precaution because of continuing medical bills from a second surgery on his client 's wrist and a two - year statute of limitations on such claims			2
along with the lingering effects of the attack , the legal case has brought @entity10 a measure of unwanted attention , her attorney said			0
' i 've learned a lesson , ' he said			0
' in any future lawsuit i 'll talk about my client being attacked by a domestic animal			0

alleged *victim* @entity10 says she was attacked by the pet duck as she *walked* past owner @entity39 's @entity4 home in may 2012
@entity10 claimed she suffered a list of injuries that included a broken wrist and a sprained elbow
