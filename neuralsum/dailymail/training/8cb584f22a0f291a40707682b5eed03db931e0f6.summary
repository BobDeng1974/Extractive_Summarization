a bizarre green flurry of lights off the coast of @entity3 left an astronaut baffled after he took a picture of it this week			1
astronaut @entity7 posted the image yesterday tweeting : ' @entity3 is a bright city			1
the green lights outside the city ? no idea			2
' the @entity12 native , who is on board the @entity14 , took the image from more than 200 miles ( 320km ) above the planet and the green glow was clearly visible			1
a green flurry of lights off the coast of @entity3 left an astronaut baffled after he took a picture of it this week theories ranged from aliens to nuclear waste and bioluminescent algae - but @entity27 claims there is a far more ' fishy ' explanation			1
it is thought the lights - the location of which would place them in the sea in the @entity36 - were in fact created by fishing boats			2
the offshore illumination comes from enormous arrays of bright green led lights used to attract squid and other sea life to the surface			1
according to an october 2013 article on @entity27 's @entity47 site by @entity48 : ' fishermen from @entity50 and @entity51 light up the ocean with powerful lamps that attract the plankton and fish species that the squid feed on			2
astronaut @entity7 took the image from 200 miles ( 320km ) above the planet and posted it on @entity59 the offshore illumination comes from arrays of green led lights used to attract squid to the sea surface short - finned squid live 260ft to 1,970ft ( 80m to 600m ) below the surface feeding on shrimp , crabs , and fish			1
@entity69 causes their food to be attracted to the surface of the ocean this , in turn , attracts the squid to the surface where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines			2
scientists first noted such night - lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s , while compiling the first maps of @entity84 at night			0
' the squid follow their prey toward the surface , where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines			0
' @entity89 boats can carry more than a hundred of these lamps , generating as much as 300 kilowatts of light per boat			0
' scientists first noted such night - lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s , while compiling the first maps of @entity84 at night			0
' these lights help reveal the full range , patterns , and night - to - night variability of these fishing activities in striking detail , ' said dr @entity101 , a @entity102 scientist who works with @entity104 night time imagery			0
' it 's just another example of how much information exists in night lights measurements and how unique they are for coupling human activity with the natural environment in a way that conventional visible imagery can not do scientists first noted such night - lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s , while compiling the first maps of the @entity84 at night			0
in this image taken from space , over the course of nine nights , fishing boats shift positions while hugging the borders of the exclusive economic zones of @entity123 and the @entity124			0

the image was taken this week by astronaut @entity7 from the @entity14
a flurry of green lights can be seen shining in the @entity36
theories ranged from aliens to nuclear waste and glowing algae
but glow comes from lights used to attract squid to the sea surface
