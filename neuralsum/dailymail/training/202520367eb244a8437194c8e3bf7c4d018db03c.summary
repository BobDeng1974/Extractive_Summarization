by @entity0 published : 18:52 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 19:23 est , 14 december 2013 the @entity1 is spending up to £ 500,000 on a major refit of its £ 1 billion new headquarters because staff have complained their state - of - the art surroundings ‘ lack character ’			1
the high - spec @entity9 hq was only opened in june – four years behind schedule and £ 55 million over budget			1
but the @entity12 has already decided to revamp two floors of @entity14 to make them ‘ more creative and vibrant ’ – following a string of gripes from staff			1
critics have branded the move a ‘ ludicrous ’ use of the licence fee			1
the @entity1 is set to spend £ 500,000 revamping two floors of @entity14 just six months after the new building was opened £ 55million over budget in june			1
it comes after staff complained their surroundings ' lacked character ' among the more bizarre innovations will be internal road signs based on past and present @entity1 programmes to help staff find their way around their departments			2
dubbed ‘ wayfinders ’ , the signs include @entity39 , @entity41 ’s @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity43 , have i got @entity35 and @entity36			0
the costly interior design revamp will also include new floor coverings , the introduction of ‘ a new collaboration project zone ’ , new meeting areas , ‘ break - out furniture ’ and revamped dressing room doors			1
@entity51 , the @entity1 ’s £ 327,000 - a - year director of television , has defended the changes , which he admits were prompted by staff complaints			1
in an email to workers , he wrote : ‘ over the next few months , we are planning some design changes on the sixth and seventh floors of @entity14			2
‘ we have decided to make these changes in response to strong feedback from television staff that the floors did not feel like creative spaces and lacked character			1
it was something people felt particularly strongly about when we moved in			0
’ in his message , mr @entity51 pays tribute to a committee of staff volunteers drawn from both floors who came up with a list of ‘ reasonably costed ’ improvements			1
new ' wayfinders ' in the form of @entity9 road signs will help guide staff through the new state - of - the - art building			1
they are part of £ 500,000 plans to make the building ' more creative and vibrant ' the sixth floor , currently home to some of the @entity1 ’s most senior staff , including @entity87 , the £ 244,000 - a - year controller of @entity1 1 , and @entity89 , the £ 235,000 - a - year head of @entity1 , is to be rebranded in line with the theme ‘ welcome to the world of television ’			1
seating areas will have existing backdrops replaced with new ones featuring iconic @entity1 logos and programmes			0
other changes for the floor include ‘ feature seating ’ , a ceiling - suspended lighting rig , new fabric wrap panels for a meeting room and a series of ‘ magnetic glass boards ’			2
the seventh floor , home to @entity111 , the £ 247,000 - a - year drama commissioning controller , and @entity113 , the £ 176,000 - a - year head of @entity115 , will include a streetscape called @entity117			2
its design will include bus - stop - type structures , new soft seating , railings , planters , an @entity42 @entity125 street sign and a pub window that would n’t look out of place in the flagship soap			0
one design expert who has worked on similar schemes said the work was likely to cost in the region of £ 500,000			0
he added : ‘ it ’s projects like this where the costs really start to rack up			0
’ but a @entity1 source claimed the work could be implemented for £ 100,000			0
both @entity139 and @entity141 mps last night criticised the revamp as unjustifiable during hard economic times			0
@entity144 , @entity141 chairman of the @entity145 , said : ‘ it seems extraordinary that the @entity1 can spend money on things like this at a time when it says its services and programme budgets are under threat			0
’ @entity153 , @entity139 chairman of the @entity154 , said : ‘ none of us get everything right when we move into a new building , but spending money on what sound like questionable improvements is inappropriate when money is tight			2
’ and @entity162 , @entity141 mp for @entity163 , said : ‘ i think this is ludicrous			0
it proves the @entity1 has still got far too much money to spend			0
’ a @entity1 spokesman said the changes were cosmetic and that the revamp was confined to communal areas			0
he said the floors had originally been designed for @entity172 and news staff who had been relocated elsewhere			2
he added : ‘ the @entity1 must ensure it continues to produce fantastic television programmes for licence - fee - payers so some changes are being made to create the most effective working environment possible for staff			1
