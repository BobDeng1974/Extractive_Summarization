they exhumed 110 unidentified people from the cemetery in 2013			1
this summer , researchers have performed 52 exhumations , but because some remains were stored together , further study will be needed to determine exactly how many bodies have been recovered , @entity12 said			1
researchers told the newspaper that some remains were found under small , temporary grave markers bearing the name of local funeral home @entity67			1
@entity70 and @entity71 county officials said they pay the funeral home to handle bodies recovered in the remote parts of @entity4 , an area that 's often deadly for immigrants from @entity22 and @entity76 who set out on foot through ranchlands amid sweltering temperatures to avoid a nearby @entity7 @entity82 checkpoint			1
more than 300 people died crossing through @entity70 alone between 2011 to 2013 - representing more than 50 per cent of the deaths in @entity4 ' sprawling @entity85			1
proper burial : the bodies will be examined and cross-checked with dna sent from @entity22 and @entity76 countries , with the goal of reuniting the remains with families unclaimed bodies : teams from @entity13 and the @entity15 are exhuming the bodies of more than 50 immigrants who died , mostly from heat exhaustion , while crossing illegally from @entity22 into the @entity7 @entity70 chief deputy @entity98 said the funeral home charges $ 450 to handle each body			1

' no matter if this is one of our client families we serve on a traditional basis or a migrant family 's loved one we 're serving and we do n't have any identification of the loved one , i do want to let you know it is our policy to treat the decedent with care , to treat them just like we would treat anyone else , ' @entity111 spokeswoman @entity113 told the newspaper			0
puzzle : many of the bodies were buried together in bags and piled on top of each other , making it difficult to determine how many people were buried there @entity139 task : @entity140 and @entity141 with the @entity15 archeology & forensics laboratory digging up a casket at the @entity10 in @entity11 @entity113 said the funeral home has ' certain records related to these burials , but this does not amount to confirmation that @entity67 was involved in depositing the remains in the manner the researchers described			1
' the funeral home would not give the newspaper access to those records			2

@entity12 said bodies that were not already skeletonized before burial were found in varying states of decomposition			0

@entity165 , an immigrant rights advocate who has worked to try and prevent immigrant deaths on the long and arduous trail they take through @entity70 establishing water stations says the dead deserve dignity in death			0

' it just goes to the language , to the words , and words mean a lot : " all these were illegals			0
" even in death , they wound up not getting the proper respect			0
