tough new laws introduced to help @entity2 and @entity3 stop would - be terrorists from leaving the country and joining terror groups overseas are set to be watered down			1
a review of the @entity9 's proposed counter-terror measures has recommended the bill be passed but also found many of the changes too tough and the committee has put forward 36 recommended changes			1
among them , restricting the ability of attorney - general @entity16 to declare certain country 's a ' no - go zone ' because of terror links			1
' this is urgent legislation which deals with a clear and immediate threat for the safety of the @entity33 public , ' senator @entity16 said			1
the crime of ' entering , or remaining in , a declared area ' should also expire two years after the federal election , rather than in 10 years as proposed in the bill			1
the report also urges the government to water down its plans to extend preventative detention orders , control orders and stop search and seizure powers for terrorist suspects			0
they should expire in 2018 rather than the proposed 10 years , it says			1
the committee also said that it ' examined whether the @entity49 incorporates adequate safeguards and accountability mechanisms to ensure the proper application of the laws into the future and whether the @entity49 is drafted in a way to avoid any foreseeable unintended consequences '			2
it has called the legislation ' complex ' and wants a longer public consultation period			2
the bill includes a planned increase to the ' @entity64 powers ' in the @entity65 relating to terrorism offences , such as linking with terror groups such as @entity68 , for a 10 year period but the committee wants it be reduced to 24 months post the next federal poll one of the key element of this second part of new terror laws was the government having the ability to declare a terrorist hot spot a ' no go zone ' making it potentially a crime to travel there			1
whole countries should not be declared terrorist zones only particular regions , the committee said			0
the government has responded , with the prime minister confirming it would consider seriously the recommendations			0
' i am confident that the recommendations of this committee will be serious and we will take them seriously , ' @entity87 said			0
' i am confident that the recommendations of this committee will be serious and we will take them seriously , ' @entity87 said he said had a lot of faith in the committee 's work			2
human rights and @entity99 groups have written to the attorney - general calling on the government to slow the introduction of the new measures			1
they say the laws will restrict personal freedom and are n't needed to crack down on home - grown extremists			0
the government wants the laws passed in the next couple of weeks			0
' given the nature of these powers , it is important that their use and ongoing need is assessed within a reasonable timeframe , ' the report says			0
the preventative detention order allows police to detain a terrorism suspect for 14 days with the aim of preventing an imminent terrorist attack			0
privacy advocates are concerned about the bill 's proposed expansion of biometric data collection , with the @entity129 to store more details of millions of @entity33 travelling in and out of the country			1
the government wants to legislate for future collection of data such as fingerprints and iris scans , should technology improve			0
but the committee wants that removed from the bill and ' given the sensitive nature of the data ' recommends the government introduce it as separate legislation			2
despite supporting the bill , @entity145 is concerned the legislation is being rushed through and has n't been properly analysed			0
@entity149 leader @entity148 says @entity33 should be worried by the laws , which are an ' overreach ' and impinge on the rights of ordinary people .			2

joint *parliamentary* committee on security have called for 36 changes to the ' foreign *fighters* bill '
@entity33 's spy and security agencies ' ability to *monitor* or hold without charge anyone suspected of terror be reduced to 24 months not 10 years
