by @entity0 and @entity1 parents of a 10 - year - old cystic fibrosis sufferer who is too young to receive a life - saving transplant have asked the public directly to help save their daughter 's life			1
@entity9 and @entity10 pleaded to the public in a statement sunday for a lung donation from any family able to give it to their daughter @entity16			1
' essentially , @entity16 has been left to die , ' @entity16 's parents said in the statement , according to the @entity19			1
battle : ten - year - old @entity21 has been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 18 months the @entity24 issued the call - to - arms after unsuccessful efforts by @entity28 secretary @entity27 to help @entity16			1
though @entity27 asked for the @entity30 to review the policy on lung allocation in a letter friday , according to @entity34 , she did not override it			1
' @entity37 ' decision to not exercise her very clear authority under the law to intervene and mandate a variance that would help save @entity16 's life is devastating , ' @entity16 's parents said in the statement according to the @entity19			1
@entity16 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , was born with cystic fibrosis and she now lives at @entity46 as her lungs continue to deteriorate			1
she relies on a ventilator to breathe and has been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months - and is top of the priority list for children in @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity44 , @entity57 and northern @entity58			1
but so far , none have become available - and because she falls two years below the cut off for adult lungs , she can do nothing but wait			1
she has been given just three to five weeks to live			2
celebration : @entity16 and her mom @entity9 are celebrating after a federal judge overruled a law preventing children under 12 from receiving adult organs her parents learned just weeks ago that @entity16 would be given a better chance if she were waiting for adult lungs , which are reserved for people aged 12 or over			1
if an adult 's lung was modified , it would work perfectly , @entity72 reported			1
instead she must wait for a child 's lung , which are in much shorter supply ; in 2012 , there were just 10 transplants for @entity16 's age group , but more than 1,700 for adults , according to the @entity30			1
her mother called it ' insane '			0
' it should n't be about their age , ' she told @entity72			0
' if she 's the sickest person , she should qualify			0
' emotional : before wednesday 's reprieve @entity9 had said she refused to tell her young daughter just how sick she really is fears : @entity9 and @entity10 filed an emergency motion for the temporary restraining order on wednesday morning , the day after @entity91 health secretary @entity27 had turned down their appeals the system determining who is allocated lungs for transplants was overhauled in 2004 and again in 2008			1
doctors claim the changes have allowed fewer people on the waiting list to die			1
the changes meant that lung transplants are allocated by age groups			2
those over the age of 12 are given an allocation score based on how urgently they need a transplant and the severity of their medical condition			0
those who would benefit most are placed highest and given first priority			0
for children under 12 , lungs are only allocated based on the time they 've spent on the list			2
one problem is that there are few pediatric lungs available for transplant			0
in 2012 , there were just 10 transplants for @entity16 's age group , but more than 1,700 for adults , according to the @entity30			2
' the law is , in my view , age discrimination , ' she added to the @entity134			0
' i do n't know if this is too late to make a difference for @entity16			2
but we 'll keep fighting it			0
' dr. @entity139 from @entity140 , who helped write the pediatric transplant system , said the case ' tugs at his heart ' but that no system is perfect			0
he said that if he changed the system for @entity16 's advantage , ' there 's another patient , very likely an adolescent , who gets a disadvantage '			2
' we 've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible , ' he contended			0
her parents are hopeful that the issue can be beaten by someone stepping forward with a direct donation to @entity16			1
for now , they have decided not to tell @entity16 , who is the eldest of four siblings , just how sick she is			2
' i 'm not going to tell her she 's dying , because she 's 10 , ' @entity9 told @entity72			0
' i 'm going to tell her we 're going to keep fighting			0
i do n't want to scare her			0
' support : @entity16 , who has been living in hospital since february , is pictured with her three younger siblings @entity165 : despite her poor prognosis , @entity16 remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant holding on : @entity16 's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live @entity16 , who has been outside just twice in the last 100 days , said that she misses school , where she could ' at least try and act like all the other normal children '			1
but even as her lungs deteriorate , the young girl remains positive , certain that she will beat her illness and be granted a lung transplant			2
' we will [ get them ] ! ' she said			0
' i ca n't wait to take my first breath with new lungs			0
i can close my eyes right now and imagine it ... i 'm never going to quit ! never , never ! '			0

parents of @entity21 ask for help from any family who is able to provide a life - saving lung for their daughter
on the waiting list for 18 months , @entity16 is too young to receive an adult lung through the donor *network*
parents say @entity28 secretary @entity27 ' decision not to override the policy is ' devastating '
