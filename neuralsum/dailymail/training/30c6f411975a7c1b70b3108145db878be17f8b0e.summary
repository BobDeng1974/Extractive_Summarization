by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 22 march 2013 a drinker caught with a stun gun disguised as a mobile phone claims he stole it from a nightclub and only realised it was a weapon when it started ' crackling ' , a court heard today			1
@entity9 , 35 , told @entity10 in @entity11 he had swiped the modified mobile in the @entity14 area of the city centre and left immediately			1
but said when he pushed buttons to try can call his girlfriend the phone started ' crackling ' and ' tingling '			1
guilty : @entity9 , left , said he did not know the mobile phone was in fact a stun gun , right @entity9 , who appeared from custody at @entity11 , was given a five year minimum jail term for possession of a firearm			1
he claimed three men approached him saying the stun gun belonged to them and asked to have it back			2
police were then called after one of the men allegedly assaulted @entity9 during the incident on november 21 last year			1
he was later charged with being in possession of a stun gun after the device was recovered at @entity36			0
@entity9 admitted the offence when he appeared in court in february			1
he also admitted assaulting a constable by spitting at him on the same date and acting in a threatening manner towards officers at the police station			0
sentencing : @entity9 , left , is facing a minimum of five years in prison for possession of the modified stun gun , right defence lawyer @entity47 argued that his client had not set out to get his hands on a stun gun which was disguised as a mobile phone			1
defence lawyers for @entity9 , pictured , had argued his case was ' out of the ordinary ' he said that the device was not a barrelled weapon that fired bullets which could cause serious damage			1
the @entity60 offence carries a minimum five year jail sentence unless the court decides there are exceptional circumstances			2
but mr @entity47 said a five year sentence would be ' disproportionate ' given the circumstances of the case			0
he said : ' this is a scenario that is certainly out of the ordinary			1
' however , fiscal depute @entity71 argued there were no exceptional circumstances to the case and said @entity9 could have handed the stun gun in			1
sheriff @entity77 sentenced @entity9 to five years in prison			1
chief inspector @entity79 , from @entity80 , said : ' thankfully incidents of this type are rare within the city and i believe the sentence sends out a strong message to any individuals who concern themselves with weapons of any description			0
' through excellent joint working we have seen significant reductions in violence in @entity94 and across the city as a whole			0
' however , we will continue to target the small number who choose to involve themselves in violence , drugs , and anti-social behaviour and , as the public expect of us , lock the perpetrators up			0
' police forces across the @entity106 have seen a growing number of stun guns disguised as mobile phones on @entity106 's streets in recent years			2
marketed in the @entity112 as self - defence weapons , they can be bought online and delivered to the @entity106 for as little as Â£ 9			2
police fear as many as 10,000 could be out on the streets			0
one website @entity116 visited said : ' a cell phone stun gun will cause your attacker pain and leave them temporarily immobilized and disoriented , but cause them no permanent damage			2
' but such stun guns are classed as firearms under @entity106 law and possession carries a minimum jail sentence of five years and maximum of up to ten years			0
there is also concern that potentially lethal weapons , some 20 times more powerful than the @entity132 guns used by police , can easily be brought into the @entity106			0
a mail investigation in january uncovered a @entity137 website selling 1million volt stun guns which could be mail delivered into @entity106 with a free can of pepper spray			0
they are highly prized by members of the criminal underworld as an alternative to guns and knives			0
in the last three years the @entity149 police force has seized 498 stun guns in @entity151 alone .			0

@entity9 , 35 , told court he stole phone from nightclub in @entity11
felt it ' crackling ' and ' tingling ' when he tried to call his girlfriend
defence lawyer claimed the scenario was ' certainly out of the ordinary '
judge *rejects* argument and jails him for five years today
