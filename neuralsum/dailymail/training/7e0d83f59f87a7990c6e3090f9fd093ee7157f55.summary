’ ‘ people would comment on my pictures suggesting i look like him , i just used to laugh it off , but being compared to somebody who is adored by millions of girls is n’t a bad thing			2
‘ i used to get no female attention whatsoever			1
i knew a girl would never have looked at me when i was 21 stone and instantly have fallen for my personality , so i knew i had to do something			1

‘ my weight seemed to spiral out of control and i was too young to even notice			2
@entity9 , here aged 9 , gained weight by over indulging on junk food such as @entity59 and chocolate ‘ when i was fat i did n’t really used to go out , i was too scared of being insulted and what other people would think so instead i sat at home , watched television and used to eat instead of socialising			2
‘ @entity88 comments at school about how large i was really affected me , it was then i decided to do something about it			0
‘ all of the people around me were in relationships and i was always the one who was left out			0
‘ i was sick of hearing girls moaning about how badly lads treat them , so i thought if i lost the weight i could show them that not every guy is the same			1

’ i must admit i never saw the resemblance when i was bigger but since shedding the pounds i ’ve been told lots of times that i ’m the spitting image of @entity8			1
