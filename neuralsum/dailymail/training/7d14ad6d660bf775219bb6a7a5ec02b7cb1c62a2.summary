the man dropped a 14 - karat gold , half - carat diamond engagement ring along with a note in a @entity9 kettle outside a sporting goods store in @entity11			1

the note partially reads : ' this ring made me the happiest man in the world when she said yes , and the saddest when she returned it			1
' a @entity9 store in @entity3 received an expensive , albeit heartbreaking , kettle donation this week the man added that he hopes the ring can be used ' to make some kids happy '			1
@entity9 office manager @entity25 says the ring has been valued at $ 1,200			2

' his heart was broken and a time that could 've been a very joyful time , but then he gave from his heart and said this could help children			0
' ' young people , students , families that want to get together and share with their children what this money will help and it 's their way of showing how one hour or two hours will bring a change in someone 's life			0
' donations : the ring was collected by these @entity54 volunteers in @entity11 , @entity3 surprise : the anonymous donor had wrapped the ring in a $ 10 bill , so the collectors were unaware of who placed it in the bucket @entity62 is hoping to have $ 35,000 from the kettles by the end of the campaign			1
however the ringers have only raised about $ 9,000 and there are only two weeks left			0
as it stands the highest bid for the engagement ring is $ 750			2
meanwhile , last week an anonymous benefactor placed a separate diamond ring - valued at $ 1,850 - and her wedding band in one of the kettles placed outside @entity77 's @entity76			1
the rings were accompanied by a note in which the woman said she hoped they would be sold and the money used to buy toys for needy children			0
she said her husband always had a giving spirit - especially at @entity88 time			1
' to honor his memory , i donate this ring , ' the note said			2

' after all , there 's no price on love or the sentimental value of this ring			0
