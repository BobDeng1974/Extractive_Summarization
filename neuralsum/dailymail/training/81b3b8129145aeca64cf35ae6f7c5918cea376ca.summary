by @entity0 a priest who was jailed for killing a 23 - year - old nun in a botched exorcism has been chased out of his village and forced to live in a remote forest hut			1
father @entity6 , 33 , left sister @entity7 bound , gagged , strapped to a cross and without food or water for five days at an isolated monastery in @entity12			1
@entity6 , whose crime inspired a @entity16 prize - winning film , was jailed for seven years in 2005 and vowed to build a monastery in her memory when he was released			1
but when he arrived at the site of his proposed centre , the eastern commune of @entity24 , furious villagers reportedly chased him into hiding			1
@entity6 was jailed in 2005 along with four other nuns who helped him with the ritual at the @entity45 monastery in eastern @entity12			1
they said they were just trying to help @entity48 but a court in the northeast city of @entity51 convicted the priest and nuns of holding her captive , resulting in her death			2
nun @entity56 was sentenced to eight years in prison , and the other three - @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity61 - received five - year sentences			1
dozens of @entity6 's supporters packed the courtroom and prayed at the time of his conviction dozens of @entity6 's supporters packed the courtroom and prayed for the priest , with several bursting into tears when the verdict was announced			1
@entity12 's @entity71 rejected an appeal by @entity6 against his conviction			1
the crime was a national scandal for the @entity75 , which excommunicated the priest and promised reforms , including psychological tests for those seeking to enter monasteries			1
but the outcome of the case is still shrouded in mystery and doubt , despite the conviction			2
there are allegations that the court had not properly considered the suggestion that the nun might have died from an adrenaline overdose injected by paramedics			2
coroner @entity93 admitted recently that the was some credence to the theory , saying : ' i was part of the team who handled the exhumation of the nun 's body			2
' it was concluded that the woman died of an overdose of adrenaline			2
do n't ask me , i do n't know why the judges did not take that into account			0
' it also emerged after her death that @entity7 had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and her ' possession ' was unlikely to be more than a series of schizophrenic episodes			0
at the time @entity116 told the court : ' i consider myself not guilty because @entity120 's death was not down to the fact that we kept her locked up			0
' we tied her up because she kept hitting and harming herself and we would have found her dead in her room eventually			0
' i admit i tied her up and stuck a towel in her mouth and kept her like this for five days			2
' i admit that i used to cover her mouth with tape while she took part in daily mass , but only because i did not want her to disturb the service			0
@entity6 , who was jailed for seven years in 2005 , said he was just trying to help @entity48 but a court in the northeast city of @entity51 convicted the priest and four nuns of holding her captive , resulting in her death media attention : the current fate of the former @entity142 priest has been widely reported in his native @entity12 ' four nuns helped me tie her up and guarded @entity7 for days			1
they tried to give her food and water but she refused			1
all she accepted was holy water			2
this was the best solution for her because she had to recover from her constant agitation			0
' he added : ' had i not called the ambulance , she would have been well now			0
it was the last stage of her exorcism and it is normal that a person possessed by demons faints when all the prayers end			0
she was supposed to recover after that			0
' the death inspired the screenplay for the film @entity164 , a @entity16 and @entity165 award winning film by @entity12 director @entity167			1
in 1999 the @entity168 issued its first new guidelines since 1614 for driving out devils , which urged priests to take modern psychiatry into account in deciding who should be exorcised			0
and earlier this month the @entity176 gave its blessing to exorcisms as a standard practice in the @entity180			0
pope @entity181 has emphasised that @entity182 exists and was previously thought to support exorcisms			0
last year he appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair bound man who said he was possessed by the devil .			0
