he had no prospects for a full - time ride in any of @entity3 's top series , and his deal to drive a @entity5 car for @entity38 did n't come together until january , ' this race a year ago , we had no plans of racing @entity5 this season and was uncertain what our future was going to be , " @entity0 said			1
' it truly has been a dream come true for me to even be competing this season			0
' @entity0 's official celebration will have to wait until next week 's season finale at @entity50 , but he was greeted near the finish line by his parents and the family proudly posed for photos			1
' they said just enjoy it , ' @entity0 said of his parents			2
' this certainly has not set in for me , by any means			0
i am going to enjoy every bit of it until the green flag at @entity64 ( in february )			0
this is a dream come true for me			0
' the @entity66 become the fifth father / son duo to win @entity3 national series championships			1
the others are @entity70 and @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , and @entity76 and @entity77 happy family : @entity0 , 18 , celebrates his @entity24 with his mother @entity79 , after finishing fifth at the @entity24 auto race at @entity6 giving thanks : @entity5 points leader @entity0 waves to fans during driver introductions before the @entity24 auto race at @entity6 but this title also made @entity77 a champion car owner — something his late father accomplished when @entity77 won @entity5 titles in 1998 and 1999 driving for his dad			1
the championship for @entity38 was the first for the organization , which is owned by @entity77 , his sister , @entity94 , and @entity95			0

@entity103 won the race with a pass of @entity106 following a restart on the two - lap overtime sprint to the finish			2
@entity106 led 187 of the 206 laps but was denied the victory because @entity103 was given the final chance to catch him after a caution with one lap remaining in regulation			0
' it was kind of a shame , he had the race won but the yellow came out , ' said @entity103			0
' i could understand if he was upset about that			0
' @entity106 questioned the need for the caution — it was because @entity124 ran out of gas on the track — and wondered if it was thrown to prevent him from winning his eighth win of the season			0
' it 's pretty pathetic @entity3 throws these @entity106 cautions , it 's really getting old and aggravating for us in this @entity5 , ' @entity106 said			1
' it 's their prerogative , it 's their series and they get to do what they want to and i just have to settle for second and miss our opportunity on another owner 's championship this year			2
