by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 20:40 est , 31 january 2014 @entity3 's programme secretary @entity2 managed to persuade @entity5 's armed response unit to hold a demonstration at their january meeting it was a long way from @entity9			1
instead of crocheting , felt craft and cakes , the ladies of @entity11 found themselves confronted by a full arsenal of handguns and automatic weapons			1
not only that , there were tasers , @entity20 gas canisters , a battering ram , a stinger device , and stun grenades for them to inspect			1
the weapons were laid out by members of a crack firearms unit from @entity5 , who had been invited to attend one of the women ’s monthly meetings at a small village hall			2
the @entity33 group had witnessed nothing like it in its 35 - year history			1
one woman gasped and another was heard to exclaim ‘ wow ’ as the muscular sergeant @entity43 – dressed in his obligatory armoured vest – gave them an insight into his life as a firearms officer			2
event organiser @entity2 has been attempting to spice up the group ’s predictable talks and demonstrations			1
after three years of trying , she succeeded in getting the firearms team to come			2
the force initially offered her a @entity51 talk			2
mrs @entity2 , 52 , said : ‘ i thought “ how boring , we need something with a bit more oomph , ” so i just contacted the firearms unit myself			2
’ official clearance was given 18 months ago and finally the date was booked			2
the plain - speaking @entity60 told the sergeant the ladies did n’t want to be short - changed			0
her instructions were : ‘ come suited and booted			0
we want to see something			0
do n’t just stand and talk			0
’ the team from @entity5 's armed response unit took an array of weapons including tasers and a selection of guns ( file picture ) members of the @entity33 were also shown items including @entity20 gas canisters ( file picture , left ) and truncheons ( file picture , right ) the 11 - strong audience of women , ranging in age from their late 30s to late 60s , were allowed to handle the guns and equipment during the meeting , which lasted for two hours			1
mrs @entity2 , who works as a cleaner in the village pub , said : ‘ we are quite a mouthy lot and when the sergeant said he had two sets of handcuffs , @entity94 ( one of the members ) shouted out “ have you got some pink furry ones ? ”			0
it did get a bit @entity90 for a while ! ’ the group have previously had talks from the police dog unit and forensic science team			1
‘ the police are just so interesting , ’ said mrs @entity2			0
treasurer @entity106 , 68 , added : ‘ we only have 14 members so it was a decent turnout			0
i could hardly lift the battering ram thing			0
there is this stigma about the @entity33 , especially in rural areas , but our meetings can be really quite interesting			1
’ but some things never change			0
the event ended with tea and cake			0
and after letting slip it was his birthday , sergeant @entity43 was rewarded with a special home - baked lemon drizzle cake			0
the @entity3 described it as ' without doubt ' one of the best demonstrations they had ever had			1
file picture shows a stinger , similar to the one shown to the group although @entity3 takes part in more traditional pastimes associated with @entity131 , mrs @entity2 is keen to explore grittier territory with the group ( file picture ) in the past couple of years the group has enjoyed talks by a forensics specialist , a police dog unit , alcohol addiction workers and had a talk on heroin ( file picture )			1

@entity33 was shown guns , stingers to stop cars and stun grenades
the group described it as ' without doubt ' one of the best demonstrations they had ever had
