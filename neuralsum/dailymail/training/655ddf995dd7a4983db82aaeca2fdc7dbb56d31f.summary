by @entity0 a head teachers ’ leader will today issue an unprecedented apology for historic child abuse scandals that ‘ shame ’ boarding schools			1
@entity7 will admit that revelations ‘ cast a long shadow ’ over today ’s institutions			1
he will use his keynote speech as chairman of the @entity13 to apologise ‘ unreservedly ’ on behalf of the sector for past incidents of child abuse			1
he will also admit that boarding schools were a ‘ closed world ’ where reputation mattered more than the welfare of children			2
@entity23 attitudes prevailed that resulted in children being ‘ seen and not heard ’ and disciplined in line with the belief that ‘ sparing the rod ’ spoiled the child			2
but mr @entity7 will say that modern schools can not be judged on how they were in the 1950s , 60s and 70s and are now ‘ unrecognisable ’ from their predecessors			1
his apology follows revelations that 128 leading independent schools – mainly boarding schools – have been tainted by the scandal of child abuse			1
an investigation revealed in january that one or more men employed at 62 schools – including many elite boys ’ public schools such as @entity48 ’ @entity41 ’s , @entity42 and @entity43 – have been convicted of abusing children over the past 20 years			1
@entity50 and @entity51 are among 30 schools where a male staff member has been convicted for possession of child porn			1
another 36 schools have had their reputations tarnished by ongoing investigations , cases involving arrests but no charges , civil action for damages and staff abusing children who were not pupils			0
mr @entity7 , headmaster of @entity67 , a state day and boarding school in @entity70 , @entity71 , will address the issue at the @entity13 ’s annual conference in @entity74 today			1
@entity50 , on part called the @entity76 pictured , is one of 30 schools where a male staff member has been convicted for possession of child porn			2
128 leading schools have been tainted by child abuse cases ‘ it shames me , and it shames the sector , that behaviour such as this happened or was allowed to happen , and for that i am unreservedly sorry , ’ he will say			1
‘ i am sorry to those who were affected directly and to those who placed their trust in individuals who could not be trusted			0
’ mr @entity7 will say that schools are now much more closely regulated and that @entity13 members share a ‘ genuinely different attitude ’ towards child welfare			1
‘ today ’s boarding schools should not be judged by their predecessors of generations past			2
you would n’t judge a hospital now on the basis of how it was in the 1960s , ’ he will announce			0
in his speech , mr @entity7 will also hit out at claims that boarding school pupils are not well prepared for real life and ‘ ca n’t boil an egg or wash their own clothes ’			2
‘ this is not my experience			0
i expect it ’s not yours , ’ he will say			0
and he will argue that universities and employers ‘ increasingly look for more than top academic grades ’			0
‘ they look for social skills and confidence , independence and resilience , character and perseverance			0
they look for true grit			0
you want all that as well outstanding exam results ? no problem			0
that ’s what we do , ’ the audience will be told .			0
