by @entity0 published : 11:53 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 5 october 2013 an ancient trade which has sustained workmen in the @entity3 since the 7th century has come to an end thanks to council health and safety rules			1
the last 19 ' sea - coalers ' , who gather coal washed up on @entity11 beach in @entity12 , @entity13 , have been denied access to the beach after the local authority erected bollards and dug a deep hole overnight to keep them away			1
they are now unable to bring their modified @entity21 on to the beach , which allowed them to bring their painstakingly - harvested coal scraps back to land for sale			1
black gold : @entity28 , pictured , is a ' sea - colaer ' who spends all day scraping coal off of a beach in @entity12 , @entity13 fuel : mr @entity28 and the 18 other sea - coalers harvest thousands of tonnes of coal a year , which is burned for energy sea - coaling has been a part of life in @entity12 for centuries , and is made possible by the tides , which erode coal from the bed of the @entity45 , which is then washed up on the beach every day			1
each man can harvest more than a tonne of coal each day , which is then sold on to power plants to produce energy			0
@entity28 , 51 , was a sea - coaler for 30 years before he found his livelihood cut off last saturday by the building work			2
' it just absolutely shocked me , ' he said			0
' i did not have a clue it was going to happen and my first thought was , they [ @entity61 ] have gone behind our backs again – they have been trying for ages to get rid of the sea - coalers			2
' collection : this back - breaking labour allows @entity69 hall and his colleagues to collect around a tonne of coal each every day transport : mr @entity74 uses an adapted @entity21 to transport the coal , but bollards erected by the local council mean he can no longer get it on the beach stoic : the work is incredibly arduous and the men must move quickly to harvest the coal he was confronted with the bollards and hole on september 28 , just hours after he finished his previous shift at 4am			2
he said : '' it ’s all well and good for them , but i ’m 51 - years - old , have three children and i ’m self - employed so all my living has gone and i ’m stuck – they have dumped it straight on me			0
' ' no reasons have been given for the closure and when i went to try and get to the bottom of it , i was not allowed on the site because i was not wearing a hard hat			0
' @entity97 : the seawater makes the coal particles very heavy , and the only way to lift the dust onto the @entity21 is by hand dispute : @entity61 says sea - coaling must stop as the beach is for pedestrians only @entity107 defended its decision by saying the beach was only for pedestrians			1
it said : ' the access to this particular area is for pedestrians only but sea coalers have been using it to transport coal in motorised wheelbarrows from the beach up to the promenade			0
' this is compromising public safety , defacing the promenade and causing noise nuisance which is why we have taken action to install the bollards			0
' ancient : the coal was first gathered by monks in the 7th century uncertainty : coal - fired plants are under threat , throwing doubt onto the future of sea - coaling 's future scraping together : an average load on the @entity21 is two tonnes but mr @entity28 said that local people approve of the work he does as it keeps the beach clean , and that nobody complains			1
he said : ' all we ever get is compliments from the pubic - we ’re doing everyone a huge service clearing up the coal and as for the cars , the horses that are allowed on the beach are more of a threat to it ! ' it just seems like they ’re making up excuses to finally get rid of us after years of trying			0

' sea - coaling ' has taken place in @entity12 , @entity13 , for centuries
workmen painstakingly harvest tonnes of coal from @entity11 beach
they use a modified @entity21 to transport their hauls
only 19 people keep up the ancient trade , which helps fuel power *stations*
but last week @entity61 closed the beach to *vehicles* , making it *impossible* for sea - coaling to continue
