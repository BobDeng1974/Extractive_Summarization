hope : the breakthrough could pave the way for a treatment routinely taken by middle - aged people to stop dementia in its tracks scientists have discovered the key to stopping alzheimer ’s disease in its earliest stages			1
the breakthrough paves the way for a ‘ statin - like ’ drug that could be taken by millions to prevent dementia			2
@entity16 researchers have found a naturally occurring molecule that can slow the formation of plaques in the brain			1
amyloid plaques are closely associated with declining memory and other @entity24 ’s symptoms			1
the discovery raises the prospect of a treatment which could be routinely taken in middle age to stop dementia			1
it could even result in a pill that could be used to treat dementia in the same way that statins are used to prevent heart disease today			0
lead author dr @entity36 told the @entity37 last night : ‘ this is the starting point for finding a drug that stops alzheimer ’s disease in its tracks			1
it might be used when the first symptoms appear			0
but another potential approach is that people would take it as a preventative drug			2
’ the condition affects more than 830,000 people in the @entity48			0
the research , published in the journal @entity51 , is the first to reveal how the specific molecule can slow the formation of plaques in the brain			1
amyloid plaques are created when fibrils – tiny toxic threads of protein – wrap around nerve cells in the brain and form clumps which scientists believe interfere with brain functions			1
the @entity16 researchers , who worked with collaborators in @entity66 and @entity67 , found that molecules of @entity69 – part of a family of proteins that occur naturally in human lungs – can slow the process			2
tests on mice showed that the molecules stick to the fibrils and stop them forming more plaques , halting their spread in the brain			2
dr @entity36 , of @entity81 , said that the findings open up new avenues for dementia research			2
the molecules themselves are not suitable for use in pills as they would not survive the digestive process			0
understanding : the research is the first to reveal the way a naturally - occurring molecule can slow the formation of plaques in the brain			1
these plaques are closely associated with declining memory and other symptoms of @entity24 ’s ( a brain ravaged by the disease is pictured ) but dr @entity36 said many similar proteins may be more suited for use as a drug			1
‘ there may well be lots of other molecules like this – we just have not been looking until now because it was not clear what to look for , ’ he said			0
if a suitable molecule is discovered , it could open the way to a drug that can wipe out the damaging plaques as soon as they start to appear			2
dr @entity36 said : ‘ people could take them in their 60s to stop these proteins grouping together , well before the symptoms appear , which would reduce the risk of developing the devastating effects of this disease			0
’ the study was welcomed last night by health charities who said it promised to reduce the ‘ catastrophic effect ’ of dementia			1
dr @entity130 of @entity131 said : ‘ this study has revealed clues to how to block one important chain of events in the disease			0
’ dr @entity136 of the @entity137 added : ‘ this revelation is exciting as it gives scientists a whole new way of looking at the problem , opening the doors to possible new treatments			0
’ £ 30million is to be spent to set up a network of dementia research centres			0
the @entity146 will employ 90 scientists			0
@entity131 said the move would help to address the ‘ desperate lack of effective treatments for the condition ’ .			0

study is ' starting point for drug that stops @entity24 *'s* in its tracks '
research is first to reveal the way a naturally - occurring molecule can slow the formation of plaques in the brain
amyloid plaques closely associated with declining memory and dementia
may lead to preventative treatment routinely taken by middle - aged people
charities : research promises to reduce ' catastrophic effect ' of dementia
