former @entity37 and @entity39 coach @entity38 has taken charge following a dismal first season of the @entity43 era under @entity44 that saw the team finish seventh and fail to qualify for the @entity46			0
@entity4 also signed a 10 - year kit sponsorship deal earlier this month with @entity48 , announcing that it would be worth an overall £ 750million from 2015			1
