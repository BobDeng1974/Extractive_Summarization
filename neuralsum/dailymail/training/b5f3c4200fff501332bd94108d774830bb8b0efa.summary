by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:19 pm on 9th september 2011 @entity4 @entity3 leader @entity2 will today accuse @entity5 of ' mass deception ' of conservative voters over immigration and a referendum on the @entity10			1
to attract the euro - sceptic wing of the @entity12 he will use a speech to the @entity3 annual conference to accuse the @entity15 of making pre-election promises on @entity17 they never wanted to keep			1
an @entity20 @entity19 is needed to resolve the tensions caused by devolution of some powers to @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , he will also claim			2
@entity12 backbenches are angry over @entity17 policy with a group of young mps meeting on monday to discuss @entity4 's relations with the @entity10 and eurosceptic @entity33 's bill demanding a referendum on the @entity4 being part of the @entity36			1
under fire : @entity5 , pictured yesterday , will be accused by @entity3 leader @entity2 today of making pre-election promises on the @entity10 he never intended to keep in a full - scale attack on conservative credentials on the @entity10 , mr @entity2 will tell the conference that there has been a ' total breakdown in trust ' in all the major parties , with @entity49 voters disillusioned by the financial crisis and @entity51 and @entity52 by the u-turn on tuition fees			1
' but those who must be feeling the most let down , the most disappointed , are the millions of conservative voters who believed the promises of @entity5 , ' he will say			0
' they have begun to realise that when mr @entity5 makes promises about @entity10 referendums , immigration figures or human rights legislation , that he is doing so simply to get their vote without ever meaning it himself			2
' the @entity15 ' election strategy is one of mass deception and if you 're a patriotic , anti-eu @entity12 voter then your party has disappeared			1
' it comes a day after it emerged that @entity12 mps are plotting to join forces with @entity72 to try to force mr @entity5 to take a harder line on the @entity10			0
the prime minister – who yesterday held talks in @entity76 with @entity17 ’s self - styled ‘ president ’ @entity77 – dismissed calls for an ‘ in - out ’ referendum on @entity4 ’s membership			0
he told @entity70 there was ‘ no case ’ for such a vote and insisted @entity4 must make @entity17 ‘ work for us ’			0
but there are increasing signs that the issue of @entity17 is being seized on by conservative mps as a symbol of wider frustrations with the way their pro-eu @entity52 coalition partners are influencing government policy firm : prime minister @entity5 , with the president of the @entity97 @entity77 , dismissed calls for a referendum on membership and says @entity17 ' must work ' for @entity4 a day after the government announced the creation of a commission to investigate the so - called @entity105 question , the @entity3 leader will say that his party is the first to draw up serious proposals to answer calls for ' @entity20 votes for @entity20 laws '			1
' what we have in the @entity4 at the moment is a situation where the @entity20 people are the ones most likely to break up the @entity36 because they feel used and under - represented , ' mr @entity2 will say			0
' @entity3 realise that something needs to change and that the @entity4 must be based on equality and fairness			0
' that 's why we have developed a proposal which would put an end to the disastrous devolution policies enacted by @entity49 which has only damaged the @entity36 and brought about ill - feeling between the different nations			0
' it shows that we take the notion of @entity126 seriously without wanting to damage the pride of being @entity24 , @entity25 or @entity26			0
' no decision on whether to adopt the @entity20 @entity19 as party policy is expected for some time			2
meanwhile , former conservative mp @entity130 - a @entity3 member for about a year - will seek a move to the party 's frontline by standing for a post on its ruling national executive committee .			1

@entity3 leader @entity2 will also renew calls for an @entity19 in a party conference speech today
he wants to attract @entity15 angry with the pm 's policies on the @entity10
