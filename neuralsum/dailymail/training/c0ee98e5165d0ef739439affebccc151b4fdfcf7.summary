it is the latest culinary craze - slowly poaching food inside airtight bags for hours on end			1
now a new kitchen ' robot ' will allow you to start cooking those time consuming sous - vide creations before you even get home			0
named @entity10 , the device is able to take instructions from a mobile phone app so busy home cooks can start the process before they get home			1
researchers from the @entity32 and the @entity34 research center @entity33 , have been using a form of artificial intelligence called ' deep learning			0
' this involves using training systems called artificial neural networks on lots of information derived from audio , images , and other inputs			0
in order to train the robots , researchers selected data from 88 @entity30 videos of people cooking to generate commands that a robot could then execute			0
they were then able to teach the robots to identify the way a hand is grasping an item , and to recognize specific objects			0
their system was also able to anticipate the action involving an object and a hand			0
using a mobile phone , it is possible to tell the device when to start cooking , how hot and for how long			1
it will even suggest cooking sequences according to the ingredients being used and how the user would like them to taste			2
however , aspiring chefs will still need to prepare the ingredients and seal them in the airtight bag before leaving them in the 4.5 litre water bath			1
according to @entity77 , one of the designers , said : ' we 're hoping it will get people cooking great food from fresh ingredients daily			2
' it makes those involved , labour - intensive dishes you 'd normally only make for a special occasion fast and stress - free to cook			0
' sous - vide was initially developed by engineers in the 1960s as a way of preserving food before later being adopted by top chefs around the world			0
it requires food to vacuum packed and slowly cooked in a waterbath kept at a carefully controlled temperature - usually around 55 ° @entity100 )			1
users would still need to prepare their ingredients but they can leave them in the machine until ready to cook cooking meat can take several hours , depending on how rare it is to be while some recipes call for cooking times of up to 72 hours to produce tender food from tough meat			1
for @entity10 , which is sold by @entity112 for around $ 400 ( £ 265 ) has a double - walled tank , which helps increase its efficiency and requires just 30 watts of power			1
the mobile software also attempts to learn from feedback it receives about meals so that it can adapt recipes and cooking times to reflect your palate			2
the designers say the device will boil or poach eggs , as shown above , so they are ready in time for breakfast the device can be controlled using a mobile phone app , above , that allows users to set the temperature and cooking time while also suggesting adjustments to alter the taste according to the users ' preferences @entity112 has already sold 1,000 of the devices over pre-order and is now hoping to make more available in the future			1
mr @entity77 added : ' we guide you through a set of screens to learn what ingredients you 're cooking , how you 'd like them cooked and when you want them ready			1
" everything else we can either take from the food you put in , because @entity10 has a built - in scale , or current food science			2
' you would n't roast a turkey or finish a lasagne in @entity156 , but i do think it can make 95 per cent of dishes a lot better , less stressful and less time - consuming to cook			0
" cooking different foods at the same time is a challenge right now , but we 're working on ways to do that			0

$ 400 robotic waterbath , @entity10 , can be controlled using a mobile phone
the app uses software to learn its users ' preferences to improve dishes
food is kept refrigerator cool by the machine until it is ready to be cooked
ingredients are placed inside a vacuum packed bag and left in the water
the device slowly cooks the food at temperatures up to 90 ° c
