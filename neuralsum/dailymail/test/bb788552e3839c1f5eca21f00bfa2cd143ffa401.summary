in 2007 , @entity0 was named a ' @entity1 '			0
with the ancient @entity3 city featured on bucket lists the world over , visitors queuing up for the perfect photo of its other worldly beauty , it 's not surprising that cracks are starting to show			1
since 2011 , the number of average daily number of visitors has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 agreed to by @entity15 and @entity16			1
last year 1.1million people reached its dizzying peak			2
according to the @entity30 and @entity31 , the idea is to change the ' axis of the visitor experience ' making the mountain into a part of the tourist experience as well as the @entity3 city itself , with the hopes that this can control crowd flow - the project is set to cost around £ 28.5million			1
entry to the site will be moved to a visitor and orientation centre in the jungle below , and there will be three different routes through the site			0
a staff of certified guides and guards will be employed , and security cameras installed			0
certified guides and guards will be employed , and security cameras installed as part of the grand plan also , time limits will be imposed to keep traffic flowing			0
an online document outlining the plan states : ' groups of 100 visitors will leave approximately every 10 minutes ( from the visitor ’s centre ) toward any of the possible options , easing up the congestion on the heritage space with the aid of interpretive signs and a more efficient action by the guides			2
' so if groups of 100 are dispatched every ten minutes , the site would receive around 6,000 visitors per day , which works out as over two million a year			2
plans have also been agreed for an exit ramp , as well as onsite toilets			0
since 2011 , the number of average daily number of visitors has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 agreed to by @entity15 and @entity16 in 2008 , @entity16 , the @entity82 and the @entity15 government agreed that no more than 2,500 people should visit the site per day			1
due to a lack of emergency management , limited road access from @entity89 and @entity90 and poorly managed waste facilities , increasing numbers of tourists would be potentially very dangerous			0
the new master plan aims to tackle all of those issues , but it could be argued that the sacred @entity3 city might never be the same again			1
@entity98 's @entity15 expert , @entity97 , told @entity99 : ' @entity0 is not a museum , but an experience – and people go time and time again to visit certain areas			1
' so with this idea of having a specific route from which you can not deviate , being able to go with a guide only and in short slots will definitely affect the experience ; it wo n’t be the same			0
' but on the other hand – and this is the main issue – based on the increasing number of visitors , the authorities need to do something to accommodate ( and control ) them as otherwise the site will crumble			1
' on the positive side , a visitor and orientation centre is a good idea which will help organise and disperse the crowds ' .			0
