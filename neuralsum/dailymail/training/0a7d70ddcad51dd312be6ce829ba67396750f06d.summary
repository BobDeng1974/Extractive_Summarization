by @entity0 published : 19:32 est , 9 april 2013 @entity2 : 01:48 est , 10 april 2013 @entity3 wants the @entity4 to bail it out if there is another financial meltdown – even if the country breaks away from the @entity8			1
@entity3 @entity9 are insisting they want to keep the pound as their currency and retain the @entity4 as the ‘ lender of last resort ’			1
but an influential committee of peers has warned it would be ‘ implausible ’ for the bank to accept risks over which it had no control			1
it also attacked one of the main parts of @entity3 first minister @entity25 ’s economic blueprint as ‘ fanciful ’			0
@entity26 ( left ) , @entity3 's finance minister , had told peers an independent @entity3 government would expect the @entity4 to protect @entity3 institutions if needed			1
peers have attacked one of the main parts of @entity3 first minister @entity25 's ( right ) economic blueprint as ' fanciful ' an influential committee of peers has warned it would be ' implausible ' for the @entity4 ( pictured ) to accept risks over which it had no control @entity8 people had a right to hear more about the debate over @entity3 independence , the @entity39 economic affairs committee said in its report on the economic impact of @entity3 independence			1
peers called for arrangements over @entity3 keeping sterling to be made clear before the referendum and warned the @entity8 could be ‘ sleepwalking ’ into separation ‘ if the issues are not tackled head on ’			2
‘ it would be difficult to see how the @entity8 government could extend central banking services to an independent @entity3 since the @entity8 government would lack control over the tax and spending policies of an independent @entity3 , ’ the committee said			1
@entity26 , @entity3 ’s finance minister , had told peers that an independent @entity3 government would expect the @entity4 to protect @entity3 institutions if needed			1
but the committee said : ‘ this would require the chancellor to put at risk taxpayers ’ money from the rest of the @entity8 for the benefit of institutions based , and possibly regulated in , an independent country			2
‘ the proposal for the @entity73 to exert some influence over the @entity4 , let alone the rest of the @entity8 exchequer , is devoid of precedent and entirely fanciful			1
’ mr @entity26 attacked the @entity39 for ' peddling nonsense ' , saying : ' all the evidence shows @entity3 is in a far stronger financial position than the @entity8 as a whole ' lord @entity82 , chairman of the economic affairs committee , said voters in the referendum on september 18 , 2014 ‘ deserve to cast their vote based on a proper understanding of the possible economic impact ’			2
this included making voters aware that @entity3 would probably keep around 90 per cent of the @entity92 oil and gas revenue because of where the resources are geographically located			0
with the volatility of oil pricing and supply , this resource alone would not guarantee that an independent @entity3 would be a wealthy nation			0
the @entity8 ’s share of public sector net debt should also be allocated according to population , with @entity3 getting 8.4 per cent of it or £ 93billion out of £ 1,104billion			0
the committee also suggested @entity3 should be lumbered with its share of private finance initiative and public sector pensions liabilities			2
this would double @entity3 ’s public sector net debt to £ 185.4billion			0
as a newly independent country with no credit history , @entity3 would probably have to borrow money at rates higher than the @entity8 does			0
mr @entity26 , however , attacked the @entity39 for ‘ peddling nonsense ’			0
he added : ‘ all the evidence shows @entity3 is in a far stronger financial position than the @entity8 as a whole			0
