by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 4 october 2013 i am lying in a crisp white bathrobe on a vast and comfortable bed , channel flicking through the flat - screen television and nibbling on a bowl of nuts and olives while awaiting my dinner			1
a glass of chilled white wine is on its way , along with a beer for my husband @entity14			0
the environment screams chic boutique hotel , right down to the feature wallpaper and expensive toiletries in the bathroom - except , that is , for the custom - made crib and changing station parked beside my bed			2
they 're for our three - month - old baby @entity24 - not that she 's with us at the moment : instead she is on the other side of the robustly soundproofed door , being looked after by a calm and cheerful nanny			2
@entity0 and baby @entity31 in the main suite at the @entity33 , where rooms cost £ 595 per night with a ' sun room ' , yoga studio and airy dining room served by a top - notch chef , i feel like i 'm on a baby - free spa minibreak , and in some ways i am , were it not for the fact that my daughter is kicking away in her cot just down the hall			1
then again , it would be hard to put an exact label on this experience : the @entity33 is such a new concept that it does n't really fall into any obvious category			1
one part hotel spa and two parts nursery and clinic , the @entity51 bills itself as a unique new service aiming to bridge the gap between hospital and home for bewildered new mums , as well as offering on - going services for the first few months of your baby 's life			1
it 's the first of its kind in the @entity68 , and if it 's a success the owners hope to roll the model out nationwide			0
the idea is the brainchild of @entity73 , a @entity74 businessman and father of four - who also happens to be the son of princess @entity78 , which in turn makes him second cousin once removed to prince @entity82			2
he came up with the idea six years ago following the birth of his third daughter at the @entity87 , the private maternity hospital in @entity74 beloved of celebrities and high rollers - and where a standard birth package costs around £ 15,000 , with extra nights coming in at £ 1,000 - plus			1
@entity0 having lunch in the dining area with @entity97 in crib ' the figures did n't add up , ' @entity73 recalls now			1
' it 's a great hospital , but what you get for your thousand pounds a night is just a hospital room – with everything else costing extra			1
' i realised that once the professionals have done their job and helped you bring your baby into the world there was nothing between hospital and home , a place where new mums could be nurtured in an environment by qualified people who understood their needs			2
' the result , four years in the planning , is a fourteen - bedroom venue , complete with nursery , yoga studio and treatment rooms situated in the heart of @entity74 , above a department store on @entity128 's @entity127			2
if you sign up for the @entity51 package , you get a private transfer from hospital , all meals in your heavily fortified room , breastfeeding support , a daily midwife visit and babysitting facilities , should you fancy popping to the spa room for a pedicure			1
there 's also a blue - chip support team onside , some with royal links of their own			1
among them are @entity147 , one of the country 's foremost nutritional therapists who has worked with @entity152 , who offers pre and post birth nutrition advice , and @entity155 , who is rumoured to have provided the hypnotherapy birthing cds used by the @entity157 to prepare for the birth of baby @entity159 ( not , of course , that she will possibly comment on this )			0
of course , none of this comes cheap			0
a night here costs from £ 595 - a lot of money for the average new mum who is eking out maternity pay , furnishing the nursery through @entity170 and buying budget moisturiser to save money for nappies			1
for these women , i suggest , the idea of spending nearly two thousand pounds on a three - night maternity minibreak seems about as likely as doing fifty star jumps moments after giving birth - especially when most have such a strong nesting urge that they want nothing more than to go home , pull the duvet over their head and summon their mums			1
the women who can afford it meanwhile , are already staffed up the eyeballs			0
that , @entity73 tells me , is missing the point			0
' of course some women want to go home , wherever home is - but we are here for the ones who do n't			2
the reality is that @entity200 discharges women routinely six hours after a normal birth and one or two nights following a caesarean			0
' it 's medically safe to do so but that does n't mean that a woman does n't need to be supported rather than just sent home and left to her own devices			0
we 're here to offer that support in a peaceful and calm environment , to allow you to recover , ' he says			2
' the reality is that a room here is cheaper than the cheapest room at a private maternity hospital in @entity74 and far nicer than a private hospital room in an @entity200 hospital , which can also cost hundreds of pounds			2
' i find it hard to argue with that			0
knowing i was to give birth by elective caesarean i had enquired about a private room at my hospital , @entity74 's @entity228 , because it would have enabled my husband to stay the night , something that is n't allowed on the general maternity ward			1
one was indeed available - but only if i was prepared to stump up an eye - popping £ 900 a night			1
many hospitals do offer cheaper private rooms , but most come in around £ 200 - £ 300 a night – and for that you get little more than a room with a hospital bed and functional bathroom			1
against that backdrop the @entity51 costings feel more palatable , although there will of course still be many women who think that if you have that kind of money to spend you would be better of hiring a maternity nurse who can look after you in your own bedroom			0
@entity0 being pampered in the @entity249 at the @entity51 , where a night costs from £ 595 then there 's the singularly emotional business of having a baby itself			1
while any new mum is welcome the @entity51 is , largely , aimed at us first - timers – and the fact is that no - one really knows how they will feel after they 've had a baby until - well , they 've had a baby			0
i had a lovely time during my two - night stay , catching a snooze in my pristine white room while the mother and baby team fussed over @entity24 and indulging in the food from their undeniably delicious menu			1
@entity14 and i even hoofed off to the pub one evening leaving @entity24 in the capable hands of the night nanny - but then i was three months into motherhood and not as emotional and fearful as i was after i had just given birth			1
for the same reasons i was able to fully benefit from all the other services on offer , from an indulgent pedicure to a nutrition consultation and a cranial osteopathy session with the @entity51 's team of experts			0
winding the clock back to when i had given birth , it 's hard to know whether i would have been able to fully appreciate everything on offer – and whether i might have found myself yearning for my own bed , even if the sheets do n't come with a thousand thread count			0
still , it seems plenty are willing to give it a try : as i leave , the mermaid team are preparing for the imminent arrival of four new mums with their tiny charges			0
and @entity73 , as ever , is ready with an answer			0
' we 're here for whatever stage you are at , whether it is total newborn or a few weeks down the road			0
your needs change of course but we are there for every bit of it			0
if you just want to sleep you can do so knowing someone is looking after your baby if that is what you would like			0
if you want support with breastfeeding then we can help you with that too			2
new mums can have very different needs but we like to think we have thought of them all			0
