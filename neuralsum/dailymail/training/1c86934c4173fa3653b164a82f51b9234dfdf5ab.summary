an @entity1 traveller took to the streets of @entity3 to film foreigners having a crack at guessing the meaning behind a string of @entity1 slang - and the results are hilarious			1
from bloke and dunny to esky and bogan – it ’s among some classic words that appear to be a mystery to our foreigner friends when @entity18 , from @entity19 in @entity20 , put them to the test			1
the footage , uploaded to his @entity25 account , shows the filmmaker asking a number of people on the streets of @entity31 in the @entity3 what a ‘ dunny ’ means , with one man responding : ‘ a dunny is a little boy ’			1
when @entity18 asked if they knew what esky meant - a portable insulated container for keeping food or drink cool – one man responded : ‘ definitely a fine @entity49 lady ’			1
‘ like a fat person , ’ one girl suggested			0
another word @entity18 said was bogan - an uncouth or unsophisticated person , regarded as being of low social status – one man said : ‘ @entity55 is a cloth made from a fur of a badger			2
’ when asked what a ' dunny ' is - one man suggested it was an expression on a person this woman was asked what ' bloke ' meant			2
when she found out it means ' man ' - her response was hilarious while one woman was heard wording ‘ bogan ’ over and over and then she pauses and looks blankly onto the ground			2
‘ it [ bogan ] sounds like awesome – like it ’s bogan , ’ one woman said			0
@entity18 told one man to use ‘ bogan ’ in a sentence – so he says : ‘ you know , this guy has been acting bogan to my daughter ’			2
it seems not everyone is on board with our @entity1 @entity82 slang when asked what ' maccas ' was one man asked whether maccas was a fish ? while ‘ maccas ’ is a term used quite frequently in @entity1 , most people questioned had no idea it was another word for the popular fast food giant – @entity82			1
‘ is that a fish ? ’ one man said			0
‘ oh i immediately thought breasts – i do n’t know why , ’ another woman guessed			0
‘ damn that girl got some nice maccas , ’ one woman said			0
other words that left foreigners muddled were full stop and fortnight			1
@entity102 suggested it was just a term used for stopping on the road			0
this man was asked to give a meaning behind a ' full stop ' - he suggested it meant to stop at a traffic this woman guessed it meant woman 's breasts with hilarious results - one man thought ' fortnight ' was another word for trees when @entity18 said full stop was another term for ‘ period ’ , one man said : ‘ it ’s a period ? for like woman ? ’ the last word @entity18 dropped was ‘ fortnight ’ – a period of two weeks – but people were heard repeating the word , with some asking @entity18 to pronounce it again			1
‘ @entity127 sounds like medieval , ’ one young woman said			0
many said it ’s ‘ the night before ’ while one man suggested ‘ it ’s trees - some trees ' .			0
