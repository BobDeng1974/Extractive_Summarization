by @entity0 having problems working up enthusiasm for a gym session ? these photos could provide you with a bit of inspiration			2
the images of nude , very buff men doing @entity10 ( a tough mixture of weight - lifting , rope - climbing and tyre - flipping ) , were originally used by @entity17 gym @entity15 as an @entity19 ad			1
however , the gym soon found itself inundated with people turning up hoping to actually work out in the buff : naked @entity10 might sound uncomfortable but it appears there 's a real market for it			1
@entity15 gives the gym - shy some real motivation to work out originally a spoof advert , the @entity17 gym soon found people actually turning up to work out nude so overwhelming was the response that the owners of the @entity36 gym , @entity32 and @entity33 , decided to turn their prank into reality and offer real naked cross-fit classes each sunday			1
speaking at the launch , @entity40 said : ‘ people are already so scantily - clad at @entity10 that we thought we might as well throw the rest away			0
’ and , as these photos reveal , @entity10 really is a good choice for those who want to tone up , with plenty of chiselled abs and bulging biceps on show			0
unfortunately for those who fancy trying their hand at the unusual exercise regime , a combination of intense media attention and several outraged reactions saw the class closed soon after it started			1
speaking to @entity59 , co-owner @entity33 explained : ‘ it started out as an @entity62 ’s joke that got too much attention			1
‘ we then actually decided to start up the nude sessions , but in the end there was too much media focus on us			2
it all got a little too comical and we changed our minds			0
i have no idea how the story went viral			1
’ cross-fit really is a good choice for those who want to tone up , with plenty of chiselled abs and bulging biceps on show if your idea of the perfect partner is someone who manages to be both muscular and fond of getting naked , these photos could be prove the motivation you need to get to the gym it could be described as ' the @entity85 ' of workouts : a punishing regime of @entity88 weight - lifting , rope - climbing and tyre - flipping , and spectacular displays of gymnastic strength and balance			1
devised 20 years ago by @entity95 gym coach @entity10 in @entity96 , cross-fit immediately proved popular with military , police and fire academy trainees			2
later , it was adopted by @entity103 personal trainers looking for a quick way to help a-list actors get into shape among them , @entity108 , @entity110 star @entity109 and @entity111			0
' it now has a massive following and is extremely popular , ' explains @entity115 group exercise manager @entity114			0
' it 's part of a trend for group activity involving hard - core exercise - boot camps started it and there are now mass endurance events like @entity123			2
' a typical class includes a warm - up , a skill session , where you learn about a certain element such as lifting or a movement , and ends with the ' @entity131 ' , which combines and repeats all movements			0
however , @entity114 warns that it is not suitable for all			0
' some moves are very difficult , so it 's great for people wanting to push themselves but does n't suit everyone - and too much too soon can cause injury			0

the classes began as an @entity62 's gag on the part of an @entity36 gym
after being inundated with responses , owners launched real classes
classes ended after demand and media attention proved too much
owner @entity33 says he has no idea how the ad ended up going viral
