@entity0 has taken no prisoners in his new book @entity2 : the autobiography , which is due to be released on thursday			1
the former @entity10 batsman discusses his opinions on , among others , @entity8 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity5			1
here , @entity14 's @entity13 and @entity15 assess the damage			1
@entity0 and his wife @entity17 attend the @entity18 on monday night @entity0 chats to former @entity10 team - mate @entity19 before a @entity22 v @entity21 game in august @entity8 @ @entity23 ' i ’m looking forward to reading the full @entity2 book			1
might bully my kids into getting it for me for @entity28 ! ! obvs sad to see the accusations against me and i will have my right of reply ! however today is not the day and @entity32 is not the place ! ' @entity34 , former @entity10 selector ' there was no atmosphere of bullying within the @entity10 set - up			1
what we tried to do was pick the best squad to create the best atmosphere to win matches			2
' @entity44 ' it ’s codswallop ... we had a magnificent team ethos and team spirit until @entity49 took his blindfold off and then it all fell apart … he has picked on people who he thinks ca n’t answer back			2
' @entity52 @ @entity53 ' the weather at my # @entity55 is horrendous ! i blame @entity7			2
' @entity57 ' @entity0 claims @entity7 had it in for him for attempting to have him sacked in 2008			1
but @entity7 brought @entity0 back into the team following the scandal over texts to @entity62			1
' @entity63 @ @entity64 ' @entity2 has finally been able to give his side of the story			1
people can now make an informed opinion of what went on			2
' @entity70 @ @entity71 ' many to blame but mostly a lack of communication and man - management			2
i will remember @entity2 for what he was			1
a maverick who could play innings that no other @entity10 player could ! ' on the ridiculing of @entity8 @entity0 ’s one - time friend and fellow @entity83 - raised player is heavily criticised even though - or maybe even because - @entity8 was the player who tried to broker a peace deal after the ‘ textgate ’ revelations in 2012			1
prior is sneeringly referred to as ‘ @entity89 ’ , or simply ‘ cheese ’ , throughout the book , a reference to the nickname @entity0 alleges the wicketkeeper used to describe himself in the early part of his career			1
in continuing the theme he says @entity8 was ‘ a @entity97 triangle thinking he was @entity99 ’			1
@entity0 also ridicules prior , a huge cycling enthusiast , for taking his bike on tour to @entity103 and writes : ‘ here ’s a thing about playing cricket at the other end of the world			2
you do n’t need to take your bike with you			2
they have bikes in @entity103			2
‘ who the hell takes a bike ? if cheese was n’t a top genius cricketer cheese would have been a world - class cyclist			0
’ most seriously , prior is described as ‘ a classroom bully ’ whom @entity0 attacks as ‘ not captaincy material or even vice-captaincy material ’			1
@entity0 ( centre ) and @entity8 - whom he dubbed ' the @entity89 ' - at @entity125 in 2012 prior trudges off after losing his wicket against @entity127 in july - he has not played since @entity0 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) celebrates @entity10 's ashes win in 2011 on build - up to last winter ’s ashes rather like @entity131 , @entity0 was not a fan of camps held before going away on tour and he felt no differently about the one held before leaving for the @entity136 tour in late 2013			1
‘ the pre-ashes camp was the biggest shambles			0
bonding ? @entity141 ? absolutely			0
it was one of the most frustrating periods of my life , purely because i knew i would n’t see my lad for however long when we were on tour and we were here doing this nonsense			0
’ @entity0 was not impressed by the pre-ashes training camp which ensured he was away from his son @entity0 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) walk on to the pitch during a tour match in @entity136 in november 2013 a rather distressed looking @entity0 in talks with @entity7 in the @entity153 in 2009 on wanting to slap @entity44 and @entity154 @entity0 was unimpressed when , as the team gathered , the two bowlers were dead set against the point made by skipper @entity6 that they should ease off criticising fielders when they had made a mistake			1
‘ they felt that bowlers were well within their rights to be angry and aggressive towards the fielders			0
‘ i just stood there and realised that it was the closest i ’ve ever come to thinking i could willingly slap two guys on my own team			0
’ @entity0 ( centre ) was not impressed by @entity154 ( left ) and @entity44 's treatment of fielders @entity170 blasts former @entity10 ' regime ' on wanting to ‘ mute ’ @entity172 @entity0 had a long - standing antagonism towards the former @entity10 batsman and now commentator @entity172 , who he felt used information gleaned from the dressing room against him , and settles a score in the book			1
‘ he shows a better sense of balance sitting on the fence all the time than he ever did on a cricket pitch			0
the game moves at an incredible pace but @entity172 is one of those commentators you actually mute because he ’s just so boring			0
’ @entity172 ( right ) , the @entity187 pundit , is slammed as ' boring ' on television by @entity0 on criticising @entity189 @entity2 did not feel that the diminutive batsman was ready for international duty when called up for his debut in the @entity193 against @entity83 , and was not afraid to make his feelings known , although he insists this was done in private			1
‘ i have nothing against @entity189 but the fact is , at five feet six , he ’s one of the shortest men currently playing county cricket			0
his @entity200 was a jockey and @entity189 is built for the same gig			0
we were facing the fiercest attack in world cricket , i did n’t think he was up to it			0
i rang and asked @entity7 , in my usual sweet way , how on earth have you picked @entity17 ? ’ batsman @entity189 ( left ) was deemed unworthy of international cricket by @entity0 ( right ) @entity0 has taken aim at @entity10 fringe players such as @entity212 ( left ) and @entity189 ( right ) on the ‘ @entity214 ’ twitter account @entity0 claims that the hurt he felt over a parody @entity32 account in his name led to him breaking down in tears in front of @entity7 and led to his infamous ‘ it ’s difficult being me ’ comment after the @entity193 of 2012			1
the former @entity10 batsman says the parody @entity32 account made him distrust his team - mates on @entity6 and ‘ @entity225 ’ read his views on ' @entity89 ' @entity8 i did not text @entity62 ways to get @entity6 out @entity7 's regime led to cliques ( and @entity19 telling prior and @entity231 to ' f * * * off ' ) flower was a ' f * * * * * * horrendous ' ' @entity235 ' @entity0 was in a depressed state after being subject to the mocking spoof @entity32 account and felt isolated from the rest of the dressing room			1
he says he was a broken man but maintained that the exchange of messages with @entity83 players was blown out of all proportion when he spoke to @entity6 about it			2
‘ we had a fine big ding dong			0
he accused me of having done it			0
i admitted that i had been in communication with the @entity62			0
yes , but it was nothing bad			0
you guys have been treating me like sh * * for years			0
you ’ve been acting like a d * * * to me			0
i went through example after example			0
’ @entity0 denies he gave @entity83 information on how to dismiss @entity6 ( right ) in 2012 on his deteriorating @entity6 relationship the two had been close friends in the team before the @entity265 man was given the captaincy and there was soon a frosting of relations when they got to the @entity153 in @entity6 ’s first tour as skipper			1
‘ a week into his captaincy he told me in the @entity276 that i could n’t go home and see my family at a really tough time in my life			0
the way he conducted himself , the distance he put between us straight away : i just did n’t think that @entity282 was my kind of guy any more			0
’ @entity0 and @entity6 celebrate the latter 's century earlier that summer against @entity153 at @entity287 @entity0 and @entity6 are all smiles after @entity10 beat @entity127 at @entity289 to become the world 's @entity291 side @entity231 and reintegration at one of the meetings to rehabilitate him back into the team @entity44 made it clear he was not happy that he had been dragged to @entity298 for a meeting at a time when his wife was about to give birth			1
@entity0 was unimpressed by his reaction			2
‘ i just thought @entity306 , you sad , sad bastard			0
if you do n’t want to be here do n’t come			0
you are a grown man , your wife is having a baby			0
but if @entity7 calls you somewhere you just go ? ’ @entity44 ( left ) claims @entity0 's autobiography is a ' work of fiction ' ( both pictured in 2008 ) on @entity5 and how it all ended the @entity10 captain is portrayed condescendingly as a bumbling yes man who fitted the squeaky - clean image the @entity318 want from its leader			1
‘ @entity320 hates conflict , ’ writes @entity0			2
‘ he ’s another mr @entity322 - like @entity323 from @entity324			0
’ of the meeting which ended @entity0 ’s @entity10 career , he writes : ‘ @entity5 shakes my hand but he does n’t want to look at me			1
he looks at the floor			0
i feel sorry for him			0
’ the @entity10 captain has since privately insisted that he was ready to speak with @entity0 about the reasons for his demise at that meeting , but that @entity0 walked out without seeking an explanation			1
that is contested by @entity0 who insists that , even though he left the meeting after barely five minutes , he only did so after saying : ‘ is that it ? ’ he then headed straight to his lawyer to negotiate his pay - off			2
@entity0 and @entity10 captain @entity5 are all smiles after @entity10 's ashes win in 2013 @entity2 : the autobiography is published on thursday by @entity339 , priced £ 20			1
