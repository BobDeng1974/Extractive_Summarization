they 've suddenly been thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility where they now have access to all of your private records			0
' now , in the course of their daily work they stumble across something that is completely unrelated to their work in any sort of necessary sense - for example , an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation , but they 're extremely attractive			0
' so what they do ? they turn around in their chair and show their co-worker -- and their co-worker says " hey , that 's great , send that to @entity61 down the way			0
