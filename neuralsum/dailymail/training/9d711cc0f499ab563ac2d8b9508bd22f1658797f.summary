in what looks like a scene from post-apocalyptic film , a @entity1 developer has transformed towns and cities around the world into urban jungles			0
using @entity11 images , @entity9 built his jungle version of @entity13 to lets users virtually travel anywhere in the world , and see what that location would look like covered in trees , vines , and bushes			1
@entity9 has even redesigned @entity11 ’s iconic @entity22 so he ’s holding a fire torch and wearing an @entity25 - style fedora			1
@entity26 was built by @entity27 - based developer @entity9			1
it uses depth data taken from @entity11 's existing maps to plot 3d plants and tress over the top			1
users then cover a location , such as @entity36 in @entity37 pictured , with plants , trees and bushes search for a location , famous landmark or city			1
click on the @entity45 and drop him on areas which light up in blue			0
not all areas within a location will be accessible			0
move the view around by clicking the mouse and moving it up , down , left and right			0
move forward by clicking the stone - like arrow			0
to change location , click back to @entity56 in the top left - hand corner			2
and when users drop the @entity22 onto a location , a speech bubble appears saying : ‘ i hope there are no snakes			1
’ only areas accessible on @entity13 can be accessed on @entity9 ’s @entity65 version , for example , users ca n’t get inside the grounds of @entity69 or the @entity70			2
the site images render slowly , and work better on the @entity72 , although the service is also available on @entity74			0
it has limited controls and users can only move around when clicking the stone - like arrow that appears on the screen			2
@entity9 said his @entity65 experiment uses an ' undocumented part of @entity13 ' called depth data			1
once depth maps are combined with traditional maps , @entity9 said he is able to plot the position of @entity86 flora and fauna			1
this urban image is of @entity89 in @entity90 the gardens of the @entity92 plotted with bushes on @entity26			0
the site images render slowly , and it works better on the @entity72 than @entity74			0
it also has limited controls and users can only move around when clicking the stone - like arrow , pictured bottom this grab , taken on 16th @entity101 in @entity102 , pictures the @entity103 in the background			2
only areas accessible on @entity13 can be accessed on @entity9 's @entity65 version , for example , users ca n't get up close to @entity69 or the @entity70 @entity9 said : ‘ visit any place available in @entity26 by entering a location , drag the map to browse around and drop the little guy on a road			1
' it works best in environment with large buildings surrounding the streets			0
some locations need a little more imagination than others			0
’ he continued the experiment uses an ‘ undocumented part of @entity13 ’ called depth data			1
once depth maps are combined with traditional maps , @entity9 said he is able to plot the position of @entity86 flora and fauna			1
@entity1 designer @entity9 has even redesigned @entity11 's iconic @entity22 so he 's holding a fire torch and wearing an @entity25 - style fedora , pictured when users drop the @entity22 onto a location , a speech bubble appears which says : ' i hope there are no snakes , ' pictured			1
to change location , users must click the @entity56 button in the top left - hand corner this means they appear to grow out of the map , or on the sides of buildings , as realistically as possible			2
there have been similar projects in the past , namely the 2011 @entity149 game			0
it used @entity13 images as the base of the game and as players move around , they have to escape zombies placed over the top of the maps			0
the scenes created on @entity159 are similar to those seen in the 2007 post-apocalyptic film @entity161 , starring @entity162 , pictured			2

@entity159 was built by developer @entity9 and uses depth data to realistically plot plants in 3d
to turn a street into a jungle , users search for an exact location or for famous landmarks around the globe
@entity11 's iconic @entity22 has also been redesigned with an @entity176 - @entity25 style fedora and fire torch
