he spent the past seven years carefully constructing a floating eco-paradise - complete with a hot tub and internet connection - out of 150,000 recycled bottles			1
but @entity4 , 61 , started to feel the only thing missing from his idyllic life on @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity10 , was someone to share it with			1
the artist , originally from @entity14 , @entity15 , met former model @entity16 , 47 , from @entity17 , on @entity18 last year and invited her to come and live with him on the @entity8			1
' i 've always wanted to share my life 's work with a soul - mate			1
but i 've avoided any relationship with anyone which i thought would n't be the real thing			0
' i always loved my island lifestyle and enjoy each chance to show the beauty of the place with anyone i can			0
' however , it 's not the same as having that one special person in my life to share my island sanctuary with			1
' the floating island boasts a three storey house with kitchen , running water , electricity and internet connection mr @entity23 said living on a floating island has always been his dream and he wanted to share it with a soul mate despite being 30 - yards from the shore and having a base made from air - filled plastic bottles , wood pallets and sand , mr @entity23 insists his island has all the mod - cons a lady could want			1
the three - storey house on the island boasts , two bedrooms , a hot tub , three shell showers , a kitchen and working @entity70			1
it is surrounded by palm trees , mangroves , fruit trees and edible herbs and plants , which all grow from the sand and soil of the hand - made island			2
@entity16 was a successful model in @entity82 and she graced the covers of several magazines a 100ft - long umbilical cord connects the island to the shore and provides solar generated electricity , water and internet			1
' my plan is to become self - sufficient , i am a vegetarian and have many plants growing on the @entity8 which i eat , but for more variety i go by bicycle to the nearby local shop , ' said mr @entity23			1
' i have a ferry i also made from plastic bottles which can carry up to eight people to and from the shore			0
after her first visit to the @entity8 , ms @entity16 decided she wanted to make a life there - as long as she could apply her woman 's touch			1
' i 've been able to motivate @entity108 to fix the place up , ' said the former model			2
' the toilet works perfectly now and solar panels now provide electricity			0
' he is a great carpenter so we were able to work together to ensure the structure is sound and the house is as solid as a rock			2
' but the island itself gently rocks on the water , so sleeping there is like being held in your lover 's arms			0
' now , we can enjoy waking up with the morning sun and enjoying a morning fruit smoothie for breakfast and fresh coffee			0
' i have always been interested in architecture made from reclaimed materials and i have a love of @entity10			2
' so when we met i was thinking to myself – wow , here 's a man who is already living my dream life and we have so much in common			2
' ' i think most people would think living on a floating island is pretty strange , but i guess i have more of a liberal view on life			0
' ms @entity16 was one of @entity82 's most well - known models and from the age of 16 to 22 , she was featured on the covers of glossy fashion magazines			1
the contrast between her life of glamour in @entity82 and the physical labour involved in the upkeep of the island was a sharp reality check for the former model ms @entity16 ( right ) enjoys drinks with her fashion industry friends in @entity82 in the 1980s when she first agreed to visit the ecologist on his private @entity10 island , she imagined a relaxed life basking in his love nest in the tropical sunshine			1
but the contrast between her life of glamour in @entity82 and the physical labour involved in the upkeep of the island was a sharp reality check			0
' my first impression of the island was that it was an upgrade from camping – luckily , i 've always liked that @entity169 experience , ' she said			0
' living on the island looks like a carefree lifestyle , but there is a lot of physical labour involved in keeping it up especially in the early years before the mangrove roots weave through the base and strengthen everything			0
@entity8 is mr @entity23 's third bottle paradise , the previous two were in unprotected waters and destroyed by hurricanes mr @entity23 , who now makes a living through music and art , has been married twice before and has four children and six grandchildren ' a few days after i arrived , some things began to give way			1
it did n't feel very stable and i was worried that the house was going to fall through the island and sink			0
' there were also some mosquitoes cockroaches and even a scorpion in the house because there were some areas which had not yet been finished off and properly sealed			0
' @entity8 is mr @entity23 's third bottle paradise , the previous two were in unprotected waters and destroyed by hurricanes			2
undeterred by these disasters , instead of giving up his dream of living on a floating island , he rebuilt his third island beginning with ten bags of bottles he retrieved from his second attempt which was called @entity4			2
he now makes a living from his music and art and showing visitors around his private island in exchange for voluntary donations			0
despite being 30 - yards from the shore and having a base made from air - filled plastic bottles , wood pallets and sand , mr @entity23 insists his island has all the mod - cons a lady could want			0
