@entity1 sen. @entity0 , a libertarian - leaning senator will officially announce his candidacy for president at a rally in @entity6 , @entity1 on april 7 , a senior adviser to the @entity9 politician told @entity10			1
with @entity14 sen. @entity13 in the race for the @entity16 as of this morning , when he kicked off his own bid with a tweet , @entity0 plans to follow suit and launch his own campaign in just over two weeks			1
@entity6 , the adviser said , was selected over @entity0 's hometown , @entity21 , the city from which he set in motion his quest to become a @entity27 senator , for optimum venue space			1
@entity1 sen. @entity0 is scheduled to follow @entity13 's lead and announce his presidential bid at a campaign - style event on april 7 in @entity6 , @entity1 even before @entity13 , 44 , kicked off his 2016 bid , @entity0 , 52 , had his eye on april 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign			1
but the fellow @entity9 's formal announcement helped to solidify @entity0 's plans			1
determined not to be the first major @entity16 hopeful to wade into the shark - infested waters , @entity0 intended to wait until at least one other prominent @entity9 contender swam out to sea			1
already , @entity42 sen. @entity41 , retired neurosurgeon @entity43 and wealthy businessman and reality tv star @entity44 had publicly said they were forming presidential exploratory committees			1
such committees allow them to legally collect money for the purposes of travelling around the country to ' test the waters ' for a bid and to conduct polling			0
former @entity56 gov. @entity55 has made clear that he will pursue a presidential campaign but has not yet held the kind of large - scale event that typically accompanies the launch of a national campaign			2
@entity13 , voted into the @entity62 during the last presidential election in 2012 , has selected a @entity65 college in @entity66 as the backdrop for the public unveiling of his national enterprise			2
he 'll make the announcement this morning at @entity71 even though he 's yet to establish an exploratory committee			2
@entity0 has not yet signed paperwork legalizing a committee either but could do so in the two weeks before he throws his name into the ring			0
up for reelection this year , the @entity9 lawmaker first had to settle an in - house dispute over whether he could pursue his current job and the one that he wants at the same time			2
earlier this month the @entity82 gave him its blessing to do both			0
as a result , the state will have a one - time caucus , paid for by @entity0 , to determine its presidential nominee so that @entity0 can remain on a statewide ballot as a candidate for the @entity62 , as well			1
if he nabs the @entity9 nomination for president , however , he 'll have to take the state to court in order to protect his fail safe measure , as @entity1 law does not allow a politician to appear on the ballot twice for two separate positions			2
and secretary of state @entity100 , the loser of last fall 's @entity62 competition , vowed to force @entity0 to play by the rules			0
@entity0 , 52 , peaks with diners at @entity105 on saturday in @entity106 , @entity107			0
@entity0 , who has made many trips to @entity107 which holds the first primary in the nation			0
even before @entity13 kicked off his 2016 bid , @entity0 had his eye on april 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign			1
but the fellow @entity9 's formal announcement solidified his plans additional heavy hitters presumably joining the crowded field of @entity9 presidential candidates - former @entity14 gov. @entity120 , @entity56 sen. @entity121 , @entity123 gov. @entity122 , former @entity125 sen. @entity124 and @entity127 gov. @entity126 - have offered fewer hints about when they drop the curtain on their expected campaigns			1
currently they are running shadow campaigns , under the guise of their leadership pacs , and have all taken the preliminary steps to build apparatuses that can compete nationally			0
@entity139 gov. @entity138 and former @entity141 executive @entity140 could also enter the race as dark horse candidates			0
both have hinted at possible runs , but neither has strongly signaled interest or adopted an aggressive campaign schedule compared to the likes of @entity13 , @entity55 , @entity0 and others			2
the candidates known to be all or mostly in have spent the better part of the year building their fan bases in early primary states , chiefly @entity154 , @entity107 and @entity42 , and shoring up key @entity9 donors			0
@entity157 ' top contender , @entity158 , is also close to making an announcement , which could reportedly come early as next wednesday			0
the political front was mostly quiet on monday morning , however , as @entity13 prepared to lay out his vision for the country in a convocation speech at @entity71 , the largest @entity65 higher - education institution in @entity27 , save for a few tweets from his well - known detractors @entity0 is pictured here exiting @entity166 in @entity167 during his weekend trip to @entity107			1
the freshman senator has not yet signed paperwork legalizing a presidential exploratory committee but could do so in the two weeks before his campaign formally kicks off the @entity173 hit him several times over the social media network as the ' architect of the disastrous 2013 government shutdown ' and forwarded reporters an article positing that @entity13 , a @entity180 whose father fled communist @entity181 , could actually ' make the relationship between @entity9 and @entity183 even tougher			1
' the premise of the fusion piece was that in making his debut as a national candidate at a university ' whose student body is at least half white , ' @entity13 , whose policies on issues like immigration are already considered ' divisive ' by some , wo n't attract the kind of support from minority groups that one would expect given his family tree			0
@entity199 , a progressive , political action committee , tweeted that that the @entity82 's ' race to the extreme starts today ' with @entity13 's personal announcement			1
in a statement the group 's president , @entity203 , also went after @entity13 for his role in the 2013 @entity62 standoff that left the government in limbo for more than two weeks			0
' @entity13 shut down the government in a tantrum , opposes marriage equality , denies climate change , and opposes a woman ’s right to choose even in cases of rape or incest , ' @entity203 said			0
' he ’s everything voters hate about the modern @entity9 in one candidate ' @entity203 claimed , ' and the entire field is already signing on to his positions			0

the announcement will take place in @entity6 , @entity1
@entity0 , 52 , had his eye on april 7 for some time , but fellow @entity9 @entity13 's formal entry into the race on monday helped solidify @entity0 's plans
@entity0 wanted to wait until at least one other prominent @entity9 contender launched a bid before making a grand show of his own
other *probable* candidates have launched presidential exploratory committees but @entity13 is the first to make a campaign - style announcement
