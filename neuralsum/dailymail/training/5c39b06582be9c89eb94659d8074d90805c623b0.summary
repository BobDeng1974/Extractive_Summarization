by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 it has been a summer @entity3 will never forget			1
from the euphoria of being thrust on to the global stage as @entity7 's penalty shootout hero in their @entity9 quarter - final win over @entity10 , to the devastation of the @entity13 disaster which claimed the lives of 193 of his compatriots and two @entity18 fans			1
it was on july 5 in @entity20 , @entity21 that @entity3 , @entity7 's substitute goalkeeper , was brought on by @entity22 following a goalless 120 minutes			1
the 26 - year - old saved two spot - kicks and made headlines around the world as the @entity27 advanced to the semi-final – he was a national hero			0
a @entity42 flight from @entity43 to @entity44 - carrying 298 passengers and crew - had been shot down killing all on board , including @entity18 fanatics @entity48 , 63 , and @entity50 , 28 , on their way to watch their team play in @entity54			1
@entity3 , enjoying a post @entity9 holiday at the time , was sickened			1
' you go from such a high to real life and lives being taken			2
it 's sick , ' said @entity3 , who was born and raised in the @entity61 before signing for @entity18 as a 17 - year - old			1
' i have two families – in @entity7 and in @entity18			1
i get shivers just thinking about it			0
it 's such a tragedy			1
tragedy : two @entity18 fans were among 298 passengers killed after a plane was shot down tribute : @entity18 fans carried out a one minute silence in @entity75 after the tragic event @entity18 remembers fans caught in @entity13 disaster ' so many people who have nothing to do with any conflict out there to be shot down , and so many families affected , it 's just disgusting when you think about it			1
it 's hard to think of words to describe it			2
' events in @entity40 , of course , put the relative highs and lows of football into perspective			0
but @entity3 admits that his @entity9 experience less than two weeks earlier had ranked as ' the best of his life '			1
' it 's what you dream of as a little boy , going to a @entity9 , and the experience did not disappoint – it was amazing , ' he said			1
after beating @entity103 in the first game i was like “ ah well , he ( @entity22 , then @entity7 manager ) is not going to change a winning team now , is he ? ”			1
highlight : @entity3 says his exploits in @entity21 were ' the best of his life ' ' and then that moment came in the quarter - final			1
before we went to the stadium the goalkeeper coach pulled me over and said there was a big chance they would use me if penalties arrive			2
' at the time i thought , “ yeah , good one , it probably wo n't happen ”			0
then the game went on and we hit the post , the crossbar and missed so many chances			0
' i started itching more and more and got the call to get warmed up and it was just a surreal moment			0
' i was not allowed to tell anyone either but i was doing my stretching and all sorts and the boys were looking at me thinking , “ what 's going on ? ”			2
' and when the moment came it was the best 10 minutes of my life , as well as my little girl being born of course			0
spot on : penalty - saving expert @entity3 was due to feature in the last four shootout ' it was surreal but it is what you work for and work towards			1
it gave me such a boost – that 's where i want to be , on that stage			1
' @entity3 , though , was a reserve again for the semi-final with @entity144 in @entity145			1
again , however , @entity147 's plan was to use his penalty specialist should the tie go the distance			2
that it did , following another stalemate			0
but by that point @entity147 had been forced to use his final substitute			0
@entity7 were beaten and @entity3 was left to reflect on what might have been			1
' for the semi-final the manager was going to use me again , ' he revealed in an interview with @entity160			0
' it 's just a shame ( @entity163 ) @entity164 was knackered and had to come off			0
he was ill before the game and ran out of steam			0
so ( @entity167 had to go on			0
it was disappointing to go out			0
' that disappointment , of course , was soon forgotten			0
paying their respects : fans hold out boards in tribute to the two fans which were killed in the wake of @entity180 's @entity178 became a shrine to @entity50 and @entity48			2
football fans from across the world paid tribute , including a fund set up by a @entity187 supporter which raised nearly £ 33,000			0
@entity3 is now back in @entity18 , the place he has called home for eight years			1
he and his team - mates are preparing for the new season with the added motivation of giving something back in memory of @entity50 and @entity48			0
@entity3 went on : ' the reaction has been very good and shows how together everybody is in the @entity197			2
and that has been the same in @entity7			2
' @entity48 had only missed one game in 30 years , that just shows you what a commitment he had and what a commitment @entity204 have			0
that will give us such a boost to give the fans something back because they follow us everywhere			0
' and everywhere they do go , those supporters and @entity3 , in particular , will never forget the summer of 2014 .			2

@entity3 thrust on to the big stage after his penalty shootout heroics at @entity9 for @entity7
@entity18 star 's exploits *overshadowed* after two fans died in @entity221 disaster
@entity3 felt ' sick ' over @entity42 tragedy that claimed 298 lives
