by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 16:54 est , 10 march 2014 criticism : leader of @entity4 , councillor @entity5 , has been accused of using taxpayers ' cash to fund a ' jolly ' to @entity8 a council leader has been accused of spending thousands of taxpayers ’ cash on a ' jolly ' to @entity8			1
councillor @entity5 spent six days in the @entity12 so he could visit to the @entity13			1
but he is alleged to have spent just 90 minutes in a meeting about hydrogen at the expo and much of the remainder of the trip visiting tourist sights and hosting dinners			1
rival politician @entity21 , of the @entity22 , said : ' i do n’t think this is justifiable			0
' from the agenda i ’ve seen the visit was incredibly light on real work and has all the hallmarks of a jolly			0
' it is full of visits , wining and dining that would be beyond the means of most people			0
' a council spokeswoman confirmed the 11,000 - mile round trip last month cost £ 2103.86 per person - totalling more than £ 8,000 - which came out of the council 's general fund which is approximately £ 380million a year			1
a spokesman for the @entity41 ’s @entity40 said : ' what are the priorities when a councillor chooses a long - distance jolly rather than serve his own community ? ' we all know @entity4 has huge assets in this [ hydrogen ] sector but there is no need to promote these abilities at such a huge expense when they ’re known globally			0
' @entity55 , leader of @entity4 , hit back at his critics , saying : ' i was at the conference for a lot longer than an hour and a half			1
' i think how the trip built up was of great support to hydrogen projects in the city which have a huge importance for the area			0
' this is just more of the smear and bullying tactics we are seeing from the @entity22 , and they are trying to personalise it			0
but if i think something is right for the city then i will do it			0
' @entity4 , pictured , spent more than £ 8,000 sending four representatives of the council to a conference on hydrogen in @entity8 the trip included visits to @entity83 slip - dock which was designed in part by @entity86 @entity85 , the man - made @entity88 island and the man - made @entity91 peace park which commemorates the atomic bombing in 1945			1
the four man delegation also dined with the mayor of @entity91 , chairman of the city council , @entity98 and the @entity99 of @entity91 during the visit			0
councillor @entity101 , @entity102 of @entity4 's @entity103 argued that the trip was of vital importance as the council is heavily investing in hydrogen fuel			1
he said : ' of course there 's always private time on any trip but lots of important engagements took place			2
' we spent 90 minutes in a meeting at the expo but we were at the conference for more than four hours in total			1
' every single day there were specific meetings about hydrogen			0
these were extremely valuable and worthwhile as the council is putting £ 10million of public money into hydrogen - run buses			2
' a council spokeswoman added : ' the trip was unanimously approved by the @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity127 in august			2
but it is claimed @entity131 , pictured , and those who joined him on the trip had a meeting lasting just 90 minutes at the expo and spent the rest of their six - day trip sight - seeing and hosting dinners ' @entity4 is leading on hydrogen for the @entity141 and the purpose of the trip was to attend and participate in an important conference on hydrogen and associated technologies , as well as to meet with potential partners , including in the automotive industry , who have expressed an interest in working with @entity4 on its various hydrogen projects which will establish a hydrogen economy and secure @entity4 's position as a leading world energy city for the future			1
' but @entity156 leader @entity21 claims this trip did little to promote @entity4 and its hydrogen economy - which was one of the main reasons it went ahead			2
he said : ' we were told that the trip would promote @entity4 and the hydrogen economy however this does not seem to have been high on the agenda			2
' with only 90 minutes of meetings scheduled and lots of sightseeing and dining out			2
' indeed , when challenged directly on television , @entity55 specifically denied that he was on a jolly , and claimed he was working flat out for the city			0
it is now clear that this was absolutely not the case , and it is clear that he appeared to think nobody would find out the truth			0
' @entity55 appears to have become very fond of overseas travel , like when he wastefully flew to @entity179 to collect an award for an arms - length body and now he has gone to @entity8 for 90 minutes of meetings			1
' this is yet another example of how the @entity184 and @entity185 are mismanaging this council			0
' four representatives of the council flew from @entity4 to @entity189 for the six day trip			1

@entity4 leader @entity5 flew to @entity8 with three others to visit the @entity13 expo
but it 's claimed he spent just 90 minutes of his six day trip in a meeting
it 's alleged he spent most of his time at tourist sights and hosting dinners
@entity55 *insists* he was at the expo ' for a lot longer ' than claimed
council spokeswoman confirmed the trip cost £ 8,400 of taxpayers ' money
