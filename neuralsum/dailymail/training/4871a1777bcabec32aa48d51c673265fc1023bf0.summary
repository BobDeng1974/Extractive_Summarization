midwives who object to abortions could be allowed to opt out of any involvement with women who choose to terminate their unborn babies			1
the @entity6 's @entity5 will today hear an appeal after two catholic midwives won a landmark case for the right to refuse any involvement in abortion procedures in 2013			1
@entity13 , 58 , and @entity14 , 52 , argued that being required to supervise staff involved in abortions was a violation of their human rights			2
the women had no direct role in pregnancy terminations , but claimed they should also be able to refuse to support staff taking part in the procedures			1
if the court upholds that decision it could set a legal precedent , allowing other midwives who object to abortions to take the same stance			0
but the @entity33 and the women 's charity @entity34 ( bpas ) warned today that such a ruling could have severe implications for the care of women choosing abortions			1
catholic midwives @entity14 , left , and @entity13 , right , won a landmark case for the right to refuse any involvement in abortion procedures in 2013			1
the case will return to the @entity46 in @entity47 tomorrow after @entity48 and @entity49 appealed the ruling ms @entity13 and ms @entity14 took their case against @entity48 and @entity49 to the @entity46 in @entity53 in 2012 , but lost			1
but in april last year , three appeal judges at the same court ruled their appeal should succeed			0
judges at the court will tomorrow hear an appeal by @entity48 and @entity49			0
a spokesman for the @entity33 and bpas said the two bodies are ' deeply concerned ' that the judgement ' extends the right of conscientious objection beyond the provisions intended by the @entity66 '			1
the act allows healthcare professionals to refuse to participate in abortion care , provided it is not an emergency situation			2
in 2012 , the @entity72 rejected ms @entity13 and ms @entity74 ' case ruling that participation in treatment meant direct involvement in ending the pregnancy			1
that decision was overturned in 2013 by the @entity5 's @entity80 , which judged the midwives were legally allowed to refrain from delegating to , supervising and supporting colleagues involved in abortion care on their wards			1
the @entity66 allows healthcare professionals to refuse to participate in direct involvement in abortion care , provided it is not an emergency case			1
catholic midwives and labour ward co-ordinators , @entity13 and @entity14 argued their objection should extend to supervising , delegating and support their colleagues who were directly caring for women having had terminations			1
if the @entity46 supports that ruling , it could set a precedent that could ' compromise patient care ' , the @entity33 and bpas have said			1
the @entity80 said of midwives ' right to object : ' the right is given because it is recognised that the process of abortion is felt by many people to be morally repugnant			2
' it is in keeping with the reason for the exemption that the wide interpretation which we favour should be given to it			0
' the @entity33 and bpas believe if that decision is upheld it will require all professional guidance to be rewritten			2
but their spokesman said their concerns go further , and will ' enable a tiny number of staff opposed to abortion to make women 's care undeliverable in some @entity125 settings in the @entity6 '			2
@entity126 , bpas chief executive , said : ' bpas supports the right of healthcare professionals to conscientious objection , not least because women deserve better than being treated with contempt by those who think they are sinners			0
' but ultimately a balance needs to be struck between that exercise of conscience and women 's access to legal services			0
â€Ž ' there may be a small number of healthcare workers who have a conscientious objection to providing abortion care			0
' there are far more who have a conscientious commitment to helping women who need to end a pregnancy			0
the @entity46 will review the case tomorrow			0
the @entity33 and the charity @entity34 ( bpas ) have warned upholding the 2013 decision , could compromise the care of women choosing to have abortions ' it would be grossly unjust if an interpretation of conscientious objection was allowed to stand which would disrupt services to the point that those committed to helping women were unable to do so			1
' @entity161 , @entity33 director for @entity47 , said they ' absolutely support midwives ' right to conscientious objection '			2
she added : ' the @entity33 position has always been and will remain that we support women 's choice within the law			0
' we also want to ensure that women undergoing this procedure , for whatever reason , get the best possible care , which we feel could be compromised if the current laws are changed			0
2007 - @entity177 midwives @entity13 and @entity14 became concerned at a decision to move all medical abortions to the labour ward at @entity181 , @entity48			1
as labour co-ordinators and midwives they had previously registered their conscientious objection to taking direct part in abortions , as allowed under the @entity66			1
2012 - ms @entity13 and ms @entity14 argued their supervision and support of staff involved directly in terminations amounted to ' participation in treatment ' and breached their human rights			1
judge @entity196 at the @entity46 found the pair were sufficiently removed from any involvement to afford an appropriate respect of their beliefs			0
ms @entity13 and ms @entity14 appealed the decision			1
april 2013 - the court 's @entity80 overturned the decision			0
november 2014 - the court 's @entity80 will hear an appeal brought by @entity48 and @entity49			0
' while recognising the rights of healthcare professionals to conscientious objection as described in the @entity66 , we will be encouraging our members to continue to provide professional care to women who require this type of treatment			2
' ms @entity13 and ms @entity14 were employed as labour ward co-ordinators at the @entity181 in @entity48			1
at the time of the original ruling , ms @entity13 had been absent from work due to ill health since march 2010 and ms @entity14 had been transferred to other work			1
both women , practising @entity222 , registered their conscientious objection to taking part in abortions years ago , as allowed by the @entity66			2
but they became concerned when all medical terminations were moved to the labour ward in 2007			2
they argued that before the move they had not been asked to delegate , supervise or support staff treating or caring for women undergoing terminations - a stance disputed by the health board			2
they said the supervision and support of staff did amount to ' participation in treatment ' and breached their rights under the @entity245			0
they raised a petition for a judicial review at the court , which was refused in 2012 by judge @entity196			0
she found the midwives were sufficiently removed from any involvement in the procedures to afford an appropriate respect of their beliefs			0
ms @entity13 and ms @entity14 said at the time they were ' very disappointed ' by the decision , and appealed against the ruling			1
during a hearing last year , @entity260 , representing the pair , suggested their consciences should determine what tasks they felt they could undertake			0
he told the court : ' the dividing line ought to be the individual 's conscience , not a bureaucrat saying what is within the literal meaning of the word ' participation ' or not			0
' the health board argued that the right of conscientious objection was a right only to refuse to take part in activities that directly brought about the termination of a pregnancy , and was not available to the pair in respect of their duties of delegation , supervision and support .			0

ms @entity13 and ms @entity14 claimed objection extended to their role of delegating , supervising and supporting colleagues caring for patients
