the family of a mother who was found beaten to death by her husband six hours after a neighbor called 911 for help have filed a lawsuit against the city of @entity8			1
@entity10 's heartbroken relatives said in a federal lawsuit filed on monday that the 44 - year - old might have survived if dispatchers had sent police sooner			1
a neighbor called 911 around 2am on november 18 , 2012 to report seeing a shirtless @entity10 being punched and dragged across the street by a man			1
when police failed to arrive after 45 minutes , the neighbor called 911 again			1
attack : @entity10 , left , was beaten to death by her husband @entity20 , right , in november 2012			1
a concerned neighbor called 911 at 2am but her body was not discovered until 8.15am scene : officers showed up at the home an hour after the first 911 call but knocked on the couple 's door , pictured , but left after no one answered			1
@entity20 called cops himself hours later to report the killing officers finally arrived around 3am and knocked on the front door and shone lights through a window but left when no one answered			1
eventually , @entity10 's husband , 41 - year - old @entity20 , called authorities to say he believed he had killed his wife			1
he said her body was ' cold ' and that her jaw was ' stiff '			0
her beaten body was found inside their home around 8.15am			0
@entity20 was arrested and later convicted in her murder			2
' i just want to know why they did n't do anything about it , ' he daughter @entity45 said to 9news at the time			0
she 's only 90 pounds getting beaten by a man			0
' the lawsuit names the city of @entity8 , four 911 employees and two officers , who they say failed to thoroughly investigate before leaving 18 minutes after they arrived			1
at the time , @entity60 reported that police sources said they can only kick in a door when it appears to be an emergency , but it was unknown how much the officers knew			2
heartbroken : her daughter , left , and sister , right , said after the attack that they wanted to know why officers failed to help @entity10			1
the family has now filed a lawsuit against the city , dispatchers and police officers the lawsuit also says that the dispatchers ignored the urgency of the neighbor 's calls reporting a life - threatening emergency			1
at least one dispatcher resigned			0
' somebody can find another job but you ca n't replace my mom , you really ca n't , ' her tearful daughter told @entity60			0
the case was among several recent problems at the 911 center			0
in april 2012 , a 911 caller reporting a threatening situation was told @entity8 police would n't take a report unless he returned to city limits			2
he returned to @entity8 and was killed within blocks of the earlier incident			2
and this april , @entity8 police officials said they were delayed saving a woman after a dispatcher who failed to relay information to officers about the gravity of the situation			2
in that case , @entity106 frantically called 911 saying her husband @entity108 was hallucinating after eating marijuana - infused candy and was getting a gun from a safe			2
failed : in another @entity8 case , @entity106 , left , called 911 saying her husband @entity108 , right , was threatening to shoot her after eating marijuana - infused candy			1
she was shot after a slow police response she was shot dead more than 12 minutes into her 911 call			0
officials made several changes to their response policies after @entity118 's killing , including requiring dispatchers to give certain calls , such as those involving weapons , the highest priority			0
the new rules also give officers more authority to decide how to respond to calls in which a person is in imminent danger			0
the suit says the cases show ' a widespread custom or policy of failing to identify and / or prioritize situations involving imminent danger or a life threatening emergency '			0
city attorney @entity138 said late on monday that he had not seen the lawsuit and he could not comment .			0
