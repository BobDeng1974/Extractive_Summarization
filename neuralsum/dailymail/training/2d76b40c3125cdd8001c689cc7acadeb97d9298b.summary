by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:18 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 17:27 est , 16 april 2013 a man was able to use his @entity5 roots to secure custody of a two - year - old child he had fathered but signed away all custody rights to , despite the fact the child had been living with her adopted parents since birth			1
@entity15 had been adopted at birth by @entity18 couple @entity17 and @entity19 , with @entity17 even cutting biological mom @entity21 ’s umbilical cord			1
but @entity22 , a member of the @entity23 , claimed the baby 's mother had given the child up without his consent			2
' i 'm always going to be her daddy ' : @entity22 and daughter @entity15 met for the first time on @entity30 2011 when @entity22 challenged the @entity34 ' adoption , his lawyers cited the @entity35 , a federal law that gives tribes and relatives a say in decisions affecting children with native american heritage			1
it was passed in 1978 because of the high number of @entity46 children being removed from their homes by public and private agencies			2
a @entity18 court favored his argument that federal law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions and the child was handed over to him after a court battle in december 2011			1
since then the @entity34 have been fighting to regain custody of their adopted daughter @entity15 , now age 3 , and on tuesday they took their fight to the highest court in the land			1
happy family : @entity17 and @entity19 were in the delivery room when @entity15 was born in @entity63 in september 2009 the future of @entity65 is being discussed at the @entity67 @entity66 on tuesday september 2009 : @entity15 is born in @entity63 , with the @entity34 present at the birth january 2010 : @entity69 signs away his custody rights but days later files an appeal december 2011 : @entity15 is handed over to her biological father after a family court in @entity18 grants him custody july 2012 : @entity75 upholds the custody decision april 2013 : @entity67 @entity66 hears an appeal from the @entity34 attorneys on both sides agree that the @entity66 , which is hearing the case on tuesday - although a verdict is n't expected until the @entity82 - is unlikely to send @entity15 back to live with the @entity34			1
one possible outcome is that the court might send the case back to @entity18 to be reconsidered , which would leave the ultimate outcome uncertain and mean that @entity15 continues to live in @entity63			2
alternatively the court might reaffirm the decision to give custody to @entity22 and effectively end the @entity91 's chances of regaining the young girl they so dearly love			1
the @entity34 appealed to the state @entity66 last july , claiming they had bonded with @entity15 and arguing that removing @entity15 was detrimental to her development			1
but justices sided with @entity22 , saying in an emotional opinion that , while the @entity34 were ‘ ideal parents , ’ federal law requires that custodial preference be given to the child 's @entity5 parent			1
meanwhile @entity22 claims his daughter no longer even recognizes the family who raised her for the first two years of her life			1
she was handed over to him on @entity108 and he says the bonding process was instantaneous			0
@entity22 claims @entity15 had started to call him ‘ @entity112 ’ within minutes of them meeting and a week after moving to his home in @entity115 , @entity63 , she had also started to call his wife @entity116 ‘ @entity118 ’			2
hopeful : the couple are hoping that the @entity67 @entity66 will allow them to be reunited with their daughter sixteen months later , @entity22 says that he and his wife are ' the only family she has ever know			1
' ' i know that i 'm doing just fine raising my daughter and supporting my wife , ' he told @entity128			0
' i 'm always going to be her @entity112 , no matter what			0
' @entity22 also revealed that the @entity34 have sent gifts to @entity15 with their photos hidden inside			2
' when she finds them , ' he said , ' she 'll always ask us , " who are these people ? " she does n't remember			0
' in january the @entity34 claimed that they have had just one phone call with @entity15 since she left in december 2011 and that they told her they love her			2
' we remain hopeful that our daughter will finally be able to come home and to have a life where she can be surrounded by everyone who loves her , ' they said in a statement			0
@entity22 says his daughter started to call him ' daddy ' within minutes of them meeting for the first time when she was two more than a dozen states and 23 current and former members of @entity150 have filed briefs supporting the law ahead of tuesday 's @entity15 hearing			1
in addition , the federal government has filed an amicus brief backing the law , as have more than a dozen child welfare organizations			0
state courts have been at odds on the law 's application			0
the @entity163 hopes the matter will be clarified by the high court			0
the group has filed a brief supporting the @entity34 ' case			0
it says the court previously has ruled on the rights of mothers and unwed fathers - rights that , a past president of the group said , federal law has n't defined , at least for @entity5 children			2
the @entity35 gives tribes and relatives a say in decisions affecting children with native american heritage ‘ those cases clearly state that unwed fathers do not have an automatic fully protected right to participate in decisions about the child , ’ @entity185 adoption attorney @entity184 said last week during a conference call with reporters			0
case law aside , @entity184 said , the emotional aspects of the case are hard to ignore			0
' we often refer to cases like this one before the @entity66 as a tragic situation we all want to avoid , ' @entity184 said			0
' there 's no question this case is tragic for all the families and parties involved in it , particularly for this child , no matter what the outcome			0

biological father @entity22 was able to gain custody of his daughter after invoking @entity35 of 1978
federal law gives @entity46 parents preference in custody battles
@entity15 's adoptive parents had raised her from birth
they have now taken their case to the @entity66
