' @entity49 reveals the top five tips to ensure consumers get the most out of their tenancy 1			1
rental increases your rent can not be increased during a fixed - term tenancy agreement ( less than two years ) , unless it is written into your contract			1
for a periodic lease , in most states and territories your rent can only be increased every six to 12 months			0
plus , in most states and territories you ’re entitled to a notice period of 60 days			0
landlords are also not allowed to increase your rent by an excessive amount			2
while there is no set amount that is regarded as excessive , if you believe the rent increase is too large , you can dispute it through your state ’s appropriate service			0
fee - free rent payments renters are often charged fees through third - party rent collection companies			2
in @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 , you ’re entitled to at least one fee - free way to pay rent			0
right to repairs landlords are required to conduct repairs to keep the property in a reasonable condition			2
if your landlord does not take care of a repair or maintenance request , you may be able to apply to a tenancy tribunal to have your rent paid into a special account until the repairs are completed			1
right not to be on tenancy databases you can only be put on the tenancy database for two reasons : if your rent is overdue by an amount larger than the bond , or if you ’ve breached your tenancy agreement			2
your agent or landlord is required to inform you if they plan on listing you , giving you time to consider and dispute the claims			0
right to get your bond back unless your landlord can make a legitimate complaint to the bond board , you have the right to get your bond back as soon as your tenancy is over			0
