by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:43 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 10:26 est , 14 june 2012 her freebie trip to @entity4 has already provoked strong criticism , but as she reclines on a sun lounger , sipping a cool drink and puffing on a cigarette , @entity6 does not appear to be too perturbed			1
the speaker 's wife is on the @entity13 island as a guest of honour at the @entity17 conference at the 5 - star @entity18			1
but once her gruelling schedule was complete - a one - hour speech on @entity22 - she quickly took to the beach with a friend , making the most of the trip for which she was paid £ 2,000			1
all in a days ' work : despite criticism of her freebie trip as she reclines on a sun lounger , sipping a cool drink @entity6 does not appear to be too perturbed hard life : mrs @entity6 alternated between puffing on a cigarette and sipping a glass of wine in the hot sun hard day at the office : mrs @entity6 had tweeted before her trip how she was had ' lots of public speaking to do ' but also added ' sunbathing ' it was only recently @entity44 defended his @entity46 - supporting wife saying it was wrong to expect her to ' sit in the background , walk a few paces behind her husband , slice mushrooms and never express an opinion '			1
but as these as she relaxes in a blue leopard print bikini , it appears the mother - of - three has fully ensured that she does not fall in to this role			1
before arriving mrs @entity6 , 42 , had tweeted that she had ' lots of public speaking to do ' as well as some ' sunbathing '			1
in may the attention - loving mrs @entity6 claimed her £ 2,000 fee was ‘ not a fortune ’ – but admitted she leapt at the chance to address delegates			1
she told @entity65 : ‘ they said , “ will you come and speak in @entity4 ? we will pay for your flights and accommodation ”			2
' i thought about it for five seconds and said , “ yes , please , i ’ll bite your arm off			2
” i ’m not crazy			2
’ relaxing : mrs @entity6 and a friend enjoyed a dip in the ocean before heading back to the beach for some alcohol and cigarettes smiles all round : the pair appeared to be enjoying themselves - mrs @entity6 was guest of honour at the @entity17 conference at the 5 star @entity18 criticism : her free trip to the @entity13 island itself provoked criticism coming just months after her mp husband @entity44 allowed the institute to host a cocktail party in his official @entity93 apartment the @entity91 offered her the ' dream job ' just weeks after her husband allowed the organisation to host a @entity99 cocktail party in his official commons apartment			1
one @entity101 mp said the arrangement ' stunk ' – and accused mrs @entity6 of profiting from her position			1
and @entity104 , chief executive of the @entity106 campaign group , said : ' it is good that the speaker uses his position to encourage the @entity111 tourist industry , but he and his wife need to be very careful not to put themselves in a position where the appearance is given that they are getting an advantage for helping this organisation ' speaking at the conference the speaker 's wife admitted she regrets her ' cock - ups ' on @entity22 and that her nude photoshoot was a bad idea			1
fun in the sun : mrs @entity6 smiles widely despite admitting at the travel conference in @entity4 this week she regrets her ' cock ups ' on @entity22 and said that her nude photoshoot was a bad idea admission : speaking to guests the 42 - year - old admitted her husband 's job had opened doors for her - but maintained she would n't get offered jobs if she was n't good at what she does @ @entity136 on @entity137			1

speaking to guests she admitted her husband 's job had opened doors for her - but maintained she would n't get offered jobs if she was n't good at what she does			2
