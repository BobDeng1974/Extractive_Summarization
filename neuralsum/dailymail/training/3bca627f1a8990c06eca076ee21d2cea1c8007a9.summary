by @entity0 last updated at 6:55 pm on 13th december 2011 one of @entity2 's most prolific egg thieves who scoured the country to steal almost 700 eggs from seriously endangered birds was jailed for six months today			1
despite being jailed three times previously for identical offences , @entity8 , 49 , from @entity9 , east @entity10 , donned climbing equipment to steal entire nests - including those of ospreys , golden eagles and peregrine falcons			1
some of the stolen eggs are believed to have had chicks in them nearly ready to hatch , which would have been killed as he prepared the shells for display			2
@entity8 , 49 , from @entity9 , east @entity10 ( pictured today outside court , left ) , donned climbing equipment to steal entire nests - including those of ospreys , golden eagles and peregrine falcons @entity8 targeted more than 170 nests - some repeatedly			1
he now faces being the first person to also be slapped with an asbo for the offence the trophy hunter , who travelled widely around the @entity2 for his hobby , was found with his collection of 697 eggs stored in specially adapted homemade cabinets			2
he also now faces being the first person to be slapped with an asbo for the offence			0
jailing him for the maximum term , district judge @entity40 said : ' this was an ongoing venture that was n't going to stop			0
' the offence is serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified because this represented a methodically and meticulously planned venture targeting rare @entity48 birds and placing them in peril and causing substantial losses to the local community			2
a collection of eggs , from various @entity54 , recovered by police following the arrest of @entity8 among the eggs found in @entity8 's haul : ' it is made worse by your previous convictions			1
' like many of his ' underground community ' , he would make small holes in the shell and blow the eggs to get rid of the contents			0
however , many of the eggs were close to hatching and he had to remove chicks - killing the young and damaging the collection			1
@entity8 targeted more than 170 nests , some repeatedly , and his theft of golden eagle and osprey eggs was ' unprecedented '			1
@entity77 , prosecuting , said : ' a significant number of the eggs had large and untidy holes in them which suggest that the eggs were taken too late in the incubation and therefore he removed developing chicks ... including from the golden eagles ' eggs			2
' the egg thieves will watch a nest over a considerable period to attempt to identify when they are being laid and it is in fact a lack of skill on the part of the egg thief that he has got this entirely wrong			0
' the eggs will now have to be destroyed rather than passed on to a @entity100 as this would be seen as an ' achievement ' for the egg thief			0
speaking outside court , @entity105 officer @entity104 said : ' he is one of the most prolific collectors of wild bird eggs in the @entity2 and he has got a disregard for wild birds , particularly rare ones , and the people who spend thousands of hours looking after them			2
' with the golden eagle eggs in particular , it was incredibly cruel			0
he took them about a week from hatching - he basically removed a live chick ... and all he could do was put [ the eggs ] in a wooden tray and hide them in his home			1
' he is obsessive , he ca n't stop collecting eggs and he is putting some of the most endangered birds in the @entity2 in peril			2
' the balding defendant , who would steal entire clutches , had 45 eggs from @entity127 birds , which are particularly rare			1
officers noted how the eggs had been stored and categorised in a professional and organised way			0
@entity8 admitted six offences under the @entity132 at @entity133 today			0

@entity8 also had possession of eight osprey eggs - a rare bird			1

in 2004 , he was jailed for four months and fined £ 5,000 in @entity157 for taking eggs and he was jailed again for six months in 2005 after being caught with more than 700 eggs			0
benefits claimer @entity8 - who complained ' it 's a free country , is n't it ' - said he funded his excursions by hitch - hiking and living wild			1

it is an interest he has never been able to lose but he has told me today that he wants help			0
