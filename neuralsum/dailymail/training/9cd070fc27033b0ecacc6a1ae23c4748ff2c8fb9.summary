@entity1 judges dealt a fresh blow to the government today after ruling foreign families of @entity6 citizens can not be stopped from moving to the @entity7			1
until now , ministers had required @entity1 nationals ’ overseas family members to get a travel permit before travelling to @entity7			1
but the @entity12 found a @entity7 citizen living and working in @entity14 did not have to get a travel permit for his @entity17 wife to visit the @entity7			1
@entity18 claimed the ruling extended the right to free movement to ' millions of people from anywhere in the world '			0
@entity25 is now free to bring his @entity17 wife @entity26 and daughters @entity28 and @entity29 to the @entity7 after @entity6 judges ruled in their favour against the @entity7 government the controversial ruling means overseas citizens from outside the @entity6 who marry someone from the @entity6 could get the right to move to @entity7			1
a government source said the ruling only applied to overseas family members of @entity6 nationals who are living outside of the country he or she is from			1
in practice this would mean that an @entity47 partner of a @entity49 national living in @entity49 would still need a family permit to visit @entity7			2
however if the @entity47 and @entity49 couple were living in @entity14 , or any @entity6 country outside of @entity49 , the new ruling would allow them to come on a residents permit			1
the case revolved around @entity25 , a dual @entity7 and @entity58 national living and working in @entity14 , and his wife , @entity26			1
they have two young children who are both @entity7 citizens			0
mrs @entity62 claimed she should be allowed to travel to the @entity7 with her @entity7 family without having to obtain a @entity7 visa as she holds an @entity65 issued by the @entity14 government			1
however , the @entity7 government has until now required mrs @entity62 to obtain a ‘ family permit ’ visa every six months if she wants to travel to the @entity7			1
the @entity70 took action against the @entity67 under the @entity6 ’s freedom of movement rules , arguing that mrs @entity62 should not have to apply for a visa every time she wants to travel			0
the @entity12 in @entity76 , which interprets @entity6 law , ruled in the @entity78 ’ favour today , stating that freedom of movement rules do not allow measures which - in pursuit of an objective of general prevention of abuse - preclude family members from entering a member state without a visa			1
@entity88 promised tough new restrictions to stem the flow of @entity6 citizens to @entity7 free movement rules have been at the heart of the debate over immigration in @entity7 and whether the country should remain a member of the @entity6 the win could potentially open @entity7 ’s borders to large numbers of @entity102 nationals who live with @entity6 citizens across the continent			1
mrs @entity62 has to go from @entity105 to the @entity106 in @entity107 to be fingerprinted and complete detailed application forms every time she wants to travel to the @entity7			0
the process takes several weeks , even months , her lawyers said			0
the @entity7 invoked the visa regime because it had concerns about other @entity6 member states ’ residence cards , as some allegedly do not meet international security standards , and therefore could be used to abuse @entity6 freedom of movement rules			2
@entity120 president @entity119 wants to encourage the free movement of workers throughout the @entity6 but the legislation requires an entry permit to be obtained before entry into the @entity7 even where the authorities do not consider that the family member of an @entity6 citizen may be involved in an abuse of rights or fraud			1
@entity12 judges said the fact that a member state is faced with a high number of cases of abuse of rights or fraud committed by @entity102 nationals - as the @entity7 claims - can not justify a sweeping measure to exclude family members of @entity6 citizens			1
the judges said the @entity7 is able to assess documentation for signs of fraud or abuse at the border and if fraud is proven they can exclude an individual			0
but they added that the @entity7 is ‘ not permitted to determine the conditions for entry of persons who have a right of entry under @entity6 law or to impose upon them extra conditions for entry or conditions other than those provided for by @entity6 law ’			2
a government spokesman said : ‘ the @entity7 is disappointed with the judgment in this case			2
it is right to tackle fraud and the abuse of free movement rights			0
‘ as the case is still to return to the @entity7 ’s @entity167 for a final judgment , it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time			2
’ @entity7 is bound by the @entity170 ’s ruling			0
free movement rules have been at the heart of the debate over immigration in @entity7 and whether the country should remain a member of the @entity6			2
last month , @entity88 promised tough new restrictions to stem the flow of @entity6 citizens to @entity7 , including a block on @entity6 migrants claiming welfare for the first four years after they arrive in the country			0
however , the prime minister insisted he rules ‘ nothing out ’ if @entity7 demands for change fall on deaf ears , and warned that welfare reforms will be an ‘ absolute requirement ’ in the renegotiation that would be held ahead of his planned referendum on @entity6 membership			0
@entity194 and spokesman on immigration @entity196 said the @entity12 ruling strikes another blow against the @entity7 ’s power to control its borders			0
mr @entity196 said : ‘ @entity7 will be forced to recognise residence permits issued by any @entity6 member state , even though the system of permits is wide open to abuse and fraud			0
‘ this ruling extends the so - called ‘ right to free movement ’ to millions of people from anywhere in the world who do n’t have citizenship of any country of the @entity6			0
‘ this is yet more proof that @entity7 can never take back control of its borders as long as it remains in the @entity6			0

until now , @entity221 family members had to get a travel permit
but @entity6 judges ruled @entity225 in @entity14 was free to move with @entity17 wife
ruling means @entity102 family of @entity1 workers have right to move to @entity7
the government inists the case still has to be heard in the @entity7 @entity167
