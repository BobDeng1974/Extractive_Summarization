' @entity5 has halved the price of its @entity11 @entity10 7 tablet , pictured , down from £ 99 in the run up to @entity2			1
it has a 7 - inch screen , @entity22 of internal storage and runs the @entity25 version of the @entity11 operating system the @entity10 7 comes with a 7 - inch screen and has a limited amount of basic @entity30 storage available - which can be increased up to @entity31 using a micro sd card			1
this matches the storage on the @entity34 but is half of all other major 7 - inch tablet rivals			1
@entity5 's tablet has a @entity38 processor , @entity39 and a 0.3mp front facing camera			1
the 350g tablet also runs @entity11 4.2 @entity25 software , which means it supports @entity11 apps from the @entity46 's play store , and its makers claim it has a battery life of around eight hours			0
@entity49 , @entity5 's ceo said : ' we know over a third of tablet purchases are for children and family use but that one of the main barriers to not buying a tablet is cost			0
' our @entity11 7 " tablet smashes right through the previous lowest priced tablets and is perfect for families and anyone wanting a modern , portable tablet at a bargain price			2
' 2048 x 1536 @entity66 front @entity30 @entity30 @entity67 from £ 49 from £ 99.99 * direct from retailers			0
prices may vary on third - party shops or during promotions since @entity46 announced its 2013 @entity74 - built device in july , there have been six 7 - inch tablets launched from major retailers			1
these range in quality and price from @entity5 's cheapest , up to @entity81 's £ 319 ipad mini with @entity82 , announced on tuesday			0
it means this year 's tablet wars in the run - up - to @entity2 is set to be most competitive yet , and it 's likely some of the older devices may become cheaper still nearer the time			1
@entity89 , buying director of electricals and home technology at @entity92 told @entity93 : ' last year , tablets were the must - have technology product for the festive season , and we predict this year will be even bigger with tablets flying off the shelves at a rate of one every fifteen seconds this @entity2			0
the @entity10 7 will compete against the 7 - inch @entity34 from @entity15 , pictured , that costs £ 99.99			1

' @entity15 ' announcement last week that it was launching a budget device , called @entity117 , aimed at teenagers , was straight off the back of @entity13 's @entity121 announcement			2
@entity122 , associate strategist at digital agency @entity123 said : ' the introduction of [ cheaper tablets ] undoubtedly opens up the tablet market to a much wider audience			0
tablet technology is at a point where it 's cheap enough to produce good quality , low cost devices and @entity13 and @entity15 are looking to capitalise on that by selling them at a high volume to entry level users who may be using tablets for the first time			2
' whilst these budget tablets may not be able to compete with their more powerful counterparts from a performance perspective , they do perform suitably well for the casual user , and it 's likely that their features will improve in new models over time without prices increasing			0
' however , he warned that too many tablets at a similar price could split the market and users may choose devices based on what extra the company offers , such as @entity13 's @entity159 and film service .			0
