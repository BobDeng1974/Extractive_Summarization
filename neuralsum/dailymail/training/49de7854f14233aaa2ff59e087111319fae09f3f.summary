by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:00 pm on 26th july 2011 with just an ice - axe in his hands and crampons on his feet , this fearless climber faces death with each strike of his pick as he races to scale a 4,000ft icy rockface with no ropes to stop his fall			1
the stomach - churning images show world - class mountaineer , @entity16 , 35 , from @entity18 , @entity19 smashing the record for scaling the north face of the @entity23 - part of @entity25 's highest mountain , @entity26			1
the spectacular pictures were captured by a @entity29 extreme photographer in a helicopter 13,000ft in the air			1
' i did this ascent because it was an important stage for me as a climber			1
' i love the purity of this kind of climbing and the control that you get from being free from ropes			1
' that 's why i choose to climb in this way			1
but if i did fall it would mean death at this height , no question			1
' for me there is no fear - i 'm too busy with my goal of reaching the top , ' explained @entity16			2
cliffhanger : with no rope to save him , @entity16 scales @entity26 ( left ) and approaches the summit ( right ) the technique , called free solo climbing , is reserved at this altitude for just a select handful of elite alpine climbers who have the ability and nerves of steel to face this kind of risk			1
the incredible pictures also shows @entity16 tackling the @entity80 route of the @entity82 mountain , also in the @entity83 where at two hours and eight minutes he gained the quickest time for his speed ascent of this 3,200ft - long route			2
' this climb was an important part of my career			2
it 's meant that i can go on to even more challenging climbs that will push me even further			2
' for me , it 's about looking forward to the next big climb , and not just remembering what i 've achieved , ' added @entity16			2
on the up : @entity16 continues his ascent towards the top of @entity23 - part of @entity25 's highest mountain extreme photographer @entity101 , 28 , from @entity102 , needed a great deal of skill to navigate the mountain - and keep up with his subject			0
as well as hanging out of a flying helicopter to shoot in freezing conditions , he also found himself having to climb the mountain to get access to @entity16			0
' i think it 's best to just offer complete confidence in the pilots at hand			0
' i sat with my legs over the side of the heli on the landing rails and shot from that position			0
' i 've only ever shot from a helicopter twice - i far prefer being in the middle of it all and getting real gritty shots that you just ca n't take from a helicopter			0
@entity128 accomplished : @entity16 at the top of the mountain after setting a new record ' the hardest part is simply having the skill to be there in the first place			0
the high mountains and big north faces are no places for your average photographer			0
' you have to be a skilled climber so that you can take care of yourself and move independent of those you are shooting			0
' it blows the mind how fast @entity146 climbs - he sets the bar so high , ' said @entity101			0
among @entity150 's other climbing feats , he set a speed record for scaling the north face of the @entity153 , in @entity19 - in just 2hr 47min			1
@entity16 speed soloing on the @entity23 from @entity101 on @entity155 .			0

@entity19 *daredevil* made it up 4,000ft face in just 2hr 21min
