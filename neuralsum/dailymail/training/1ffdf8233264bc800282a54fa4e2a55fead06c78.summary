by @entity0 and @entity1 dozens of @entity4 mps are set to rebel in a crunch vote for the controversial @entity8 line tonight , amid claims that homeowners could be criminalised for not letting officials into their homes			1
some 20 to 40 conservatives are expected to defy party whips and vote against the north - south rail project late tonight			1
but the rebellion by @entity3 could have been far worse had @entity17 not vowed to vote in favour of it , ensuring it will go through			1
protestors will descend on parliament and dozens of mps are set to rebel as the @entity24 goes before the @entity25 for its second reading hundreds of ‘ @entity8 ’ campaigners are to descending on @entity28 today to urge mps to vote against the @entity24 at second reading			1
they warn that ‘ every one vote for the bill will mean a loss of hundreds of votes at the next general election ’ campaigners will be demonstrating in @entity37 from noon until 2pm before going in to @entity28 to meet with mps			1
campaigners raised fresh fears last night over the impact on families living near @entity42			1
they pointed to a clause in the small print of the bill , which gives a ‘ right of entry ’ to anyone nominated by the @entity42 company to enter any property within 500 metres of the line			1
former @entity4 whip @entity51 , left , and newly appointed minister @entity52 , right , are prominent @entity4 opponents of the @entity8 project @entity55 of @entity8 opposition group , @entity56 said : ’ a refusal to provide entry would be a criminal offence			2
this new power not only applies to the route of phase 1 of @entity8 , but to any property near any other potential future high - speed line			2
’ he added : ‘ this has massive implications			2
if you try to protect your property and stop the government riding a coach and horses - or train - through your home or normal democratic planning application process requirements , then you could be jailed			2
’ another clause ( @entity76 47 ) allows ministers to compulsorily purchase any land - anywhere - if they think it @entity8 creates ‘ an opportunity for regeneration or development ’			1
despite preparing for a bloody nose from backbenchers , @entity82 expects some ministers whose constituencies are crossed by the line to be conveniently away for the vote			1
among those is @entity89 , the minister for @entity90 , who is delivering a lecture in @entity92			2
newly appointed treasury minister @entity52 has also been a vocal opponent of @entity8 before her promotion to government , calling the case for it ‘ questionable ’ and ‘ rapidly deteriorating ’			2
@entity51 , a former @entity4 whip and leading rebel , said backbenchers would have come out in much greater force had @entity17 not said it would push the bill through			1
between 80 to 100 of his fellow mps have ‘ really serious doubts ’ about the £ 50 billion @entity104 to the @entity105 and the @entity107 line , he said			2
‘ only 30 or 40 will rebel but i can tell you 80 to 100 people have really serious doubts , ’ he said.but the @entity4 said several mps were reluctant to ‘ use up our stocks ’ with the party ’s whips when the project is expected to clear its second reading thanks to support from @entity17			1
‘ if @entity17 was against it then the rebellion would be a lot bigger than 40 ... it ’d be double the amount of rebellion that we ’ve got now , ’ he told @entity119 ’s @entity118			1
‘ people are saying , ‘ well , if it ’s going to go through anyway why use up our stocks with the whips ? ’ @entity127 secretary @entity126 who has tabled amendments to block the @entity129 and will vote against it added : ’ the business case does n’t stack up			1
’ former @entity4 welsh secretary @entity126 who has tabled amendments to block the @entity129 and will vote against it but she conceded : ’ there is no doubt that with all three parties whipped to support @entity8 , there is no chance to stop it			1
but i have to register opposition on behalf of the many people who do not want this project			0
’ @entity4 mp @entity146 , who has the @entity8 line running through his @entity149 constituency said the issue is ‘ toxic for the @entity151 ’ and predicted @entity17 would ‘ ditch ’ its support three months before the @entity154			1
but transport secretary @entity155 said ahead of tonight ’s vote that the country had ‘ waited long enough ’ for a high speed line			2
it was time to stop ducking the decision , he added			0
the former chief whip compared rebels to those opposing the @entity164 nearly 200 years ago			0
@entity28 rejected the initial bill in 1832 because some people objected to the railway north of @entity104			0
@entity168 's @entity17 have pledged to back the legislation a year later , it was finally passed			1
mr @entity155 attacked the strategy of ‘ incremental change ’ by simply ‘ patching up ’ transport needs			0
‘ cities and towns in the @entity105 and the @entity107 deserve better			0
@entity176 deserves better @entity177 deserves better			0
that is why i support @entity42			0
a new north - south railway line			0
’ he said his support came with ‘ much humility ’ and ‘ not a little caution ’ but also confidence @entity186 transport secretary @entity185 defended her party ’s support saying : ‘ @entity17 is supporting @entity8 to cut congestion on the railways , better connect our great cities and help deliver a @entity193 economic recovery ’			1
the @entity194 ’ @entity56 urged mps to oppose the @entity129 and expressed ‘ severe concerns about the cost and value of the @entity8 project ’ which it said will cost every family in the country more than £ 1,500			0
@entity203 chief executive @entity202 said : ‘ we call on the government – and opposition parties – to vote against this @entity129			2
‘ it ’s unbelievable that this wasteful vanity project has been allowed to proceed so far despite its flimsy business case			0
‘ the project should be abandoned now before any more taxpayers ’ cash is squandered on what risks being the most expensive white elephant of all time			0
’ the campaign to @entity217 ( @entity218 ) urged mps to ‘ abstain ’ from the second reading vote saying ‘ we are not convinced the case has been made for @entity42 ( @entity8 ) in its current form			1
’ a report by the free - market @entity224 said claimed @entity205 benefits to the @entity107 were ‘ a myth ’			0
but business backed the scheme			0
dr @entity230 , executive director of policy at the @entity232 ( @entity232 ) said : ‘ @entity8 must proceed			0
@entity28 must progress the scheme quickly , to ensure the benefits are felt before overcrowding , delays and cancellations become the norm rather than the exception			0
’ preparatory work on @entity8 is set to start in 2016 ahead of building work in 2017			0
the first phase from @entity242 to @entity243 will be completed by 2026 , with an ‘ accelerated ’ section to @entity245 finished the following year and the full route to @entity247 and @entity248 the @entity107 by 2030 .			0
