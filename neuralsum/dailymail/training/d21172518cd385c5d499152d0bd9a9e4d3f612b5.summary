keen to let their hair down , the players decamped to the club which was hosting a ' @entity37 ' that included a dwarf - throwing contest			1
worse still , @entity6 , then captain , was also pictured with his arm around a ' mystery blonde ' who later turned out to be an old friend - although not before a tranche of negative headlines appeared in papers around the world			2
when @entity5 limped out of the competition following a quarter final defeat against @entity50 and more off - pitch antics , the team , and @entity6 , who was slapped with a £ 25,000 fine for ' serious misconduct ' , were vilified			2
