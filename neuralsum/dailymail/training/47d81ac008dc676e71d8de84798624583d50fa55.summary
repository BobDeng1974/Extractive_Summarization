by @entity0 , @entity1 who should be @entity3 's next captain ? former team - mate @entity4 is confident @entity3 's loss will be @entity7 's gain after @entity8 announced his retirement from international football			1
@entity4 , who played alongside @entity8 for both club and country , believes the 34 - year - old midfielder has several more years in his legs as he prepares to embark upon another @entity16 campaign			1
the former defender told @entity19 : ' listen , for @entity7 , it 's a great decision			1
i am sure the @entity7 supporters will be happy			0
he had a great season last season with the demands of @entity3			0
' but there will be more demands on @entity7 this season , more expected because of the season they had last year , and @entity8 is still a vital part of @entity7 - and i think he will be for the next two or three years , so for ( manager ) @entity40 , it 's a great decision by @entity41			1
' @entity4 insists @entity8 could have continued to represent both @entity7 and @entity3 , as he did last season , although he admits the demands of @entity44 's most prestigious club competition lie behind his decision			1
he said : ' i think he could have			0
i think he has shown that throughout his career , he has been able to deal with the demands of @entity7 and @entity3			0
leader : @entity8 captained @entity3 at two @entity49 and one @entity50 ' i think just that fact of @entity7 being back into @entity44 now , that adds to the schedule of games			1
' at times , you are playing two or three times a week because he is still vitally important to @entity7 , and i think he is also for @entity3 in some ways because there is n't a natural person you could see taking the role he has now with @entity3 in terms of that holding role , that sitting role			0
' there are not many young players coming through in that role , but @entity3 will have to find someone to fill that role			0
' wonderstrike : gerrard scores in @entity3 's 5 - 1 win over @entity72 in 2001 @entity8 ended his @entity3 career having won the last of his 114 caps at an ultimately disappointing @entity76 finals in @entity77 , and @entity4 admits he will have done so , like many of his contemporaries , regretting the fact that a so - called @entity81 never quite reached the heights expected of it			1
he said : ' of course , that 's not just @entity85 , that 's a whole generation of those players , that they never got quite close enough , maybe even getting to a semi-final or a final in a big tournament			2
' you think of the players they have had over the last decade or so , i think it will be a big disappointment for all of them			0
glory days : @entity4 ( left ) and @entity8 celebrate winning the @entity16 in 2005 ' that 's why it probably was a bigger decision , because @entity3 did n't do so well in the summer			1
' i think he would have loved to have had a great @entity76 , the team do really well , all come back and then his decision to retire may have been a bit easier because i think he , along with a lot of those players who played in that decade or so , may feel we probably should have achieved more			2
' former @entity3 colleague @entity107 took to @entity108 after hearing the news			2
@entity107 tweeted : ' next @entity3 captain ? ? ? @entity8 has been an incredible player			1
surpassing 100 caps is some achievement			0
' he was joined by former @entity3 striker @entity114 , who posted : ' @entity8 has retired from international football			1
he 's been a wonderful servant to his country			2
a great player who always gave all			0
' @entity3 midfielder @entity120 tweeted : ' amazing international career , inspirational captain , an absolute honour to play with someone i looked up to growing up and still do ! # @entity126			1
' old friends : @entity107 ( second right ) with @entity8 on international duty back in 2006 role model : @entity120 ( right ) played alongside @entity8 for @entity3 at the @entity76 former @entity7 chief executive @entity131 paid tribute to an international captain who allowed his football to do his talking			1
@entity131 said : ' @entity8 was the sort who led by example			2
he was n't necessarily always demonstrative or the one that made the most noise , but he was a true leader by example			0
' he had a quieter determination , a phenomenal will to succeed and he 's the sort who would have gone around making his point to the players one by one and quietly without being as demonstrative as some			2
' but i know it was something that he cared absolutely passionately about			0
despite all the honours he had won , it was a great honour for him when he was finally given the captaincy			0
