former jump jockey @entity0 says it is ‘ outrageous ’ of the @entity2 to suggest he does not feel remorse for previous disciplinary breaches as racing ’s ruling body sent out a clear signal that they will continue to oppose him becoming a trainer			1
details emerged on tuesday of the case in which @entity0 was found not guilty of operating as an ‘ unlicensed trainer ’ controlling his own horses while working for @entity16 trainer @entity15			1
but the disciplinary panel flagged up ‘ disturbing features ’ that ‘ may be found relevant by the @entity19 when it comes to decide upon @entity0 ’s training licence application			1
these included a ‘ failure to recognise the seriousness of the misconduct which led to his disqualifications '			2
former jump jockey @entity0 pictured at @entity29 racecourse in august 2013 @entity0 remains a hugely controversial figure who polarises opinion within the sport because of the five - year ban he received from the @entity35 in 2002 for receiving money for tips from @entity38 , a man subsequently sent to jail for 30 years after being exposed as one of @entity42 ’s biggest drug dealers			1
but he says it is wrong to suggest he does not regret his past misdemeanors			0
@entity0 said : ‘ i had unreservedly apologised and said it on a number of occasions			2
they are obviously not believing the sincerity of my apology			0
‘ they seem to believe everyone else			0
i have been promised lots of horses from big owners and i want them to let me get on with my life			0
i ca n’t believe they do n’t think i am remorseful for what i did in the past			0
of course , i am			0
‘ i have publically said i am sorry and wrote them letters			0
’ @entity0 lodged an application to train in may 2013			1
@entity0 ( right ) poses with former @entity63 manager sir @entity62 at @entity64 in 1999 the latest investigation , involving 12 horses which ran in 116 races and picked up 19 wins between october 2012 and may 2014 , heard that @entity0 had directly charged owners training fees and raceday expenses as well as taking a share of @entity15 ’s prize money			1
but the panel , while conceding it was a ‘ close run thing ’ it concluded that @entity15 made the entries for the horses and supervised their work regimes – enough for the @entity2 not to have proven their case			0
@entity2 spokesman @entity80 said : ‘ we note that the @entity82 had significant concerns with @entity0 ’s conduct , which will be considered when determining his suitability to hold a licence			2
’ while plenty will applaud the @entity2 sticking to its hard line , @entity0 has been found not guilty of the latest charge			2
having this year granted jockey @entity90 , who was banned for admitting he stopped a horse , a licence to ride , to continue to obstruct @entity0 , who has paid the price for his misdemeanors , is a questionable line of action .			1
