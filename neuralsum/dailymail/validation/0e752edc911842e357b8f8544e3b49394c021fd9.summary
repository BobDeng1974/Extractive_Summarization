a £ 1billion tidal lagoon off the coast of south @entity2 will form the centrepiece of ambitious renewable energy plans to be unveiled today			0
@entity5 is set to use his budget today to announce that the government is beginning formal talks on funding the project to produce energy from turbines in @entity12 , south @entity2			1
the scheme would be over an area of more than four square miles cordoned off by a breakwater , with power generated as the tides pass through turbines when going in and out			1
controversially , this is far greater than the subsidy of up to £ 92.50 per @entity56 agreed for the planned @entity58 nuclear plant @entity59 - and triple the wholesale electricity prices of £ 50 per mwh			0
but the @entity61 is said to have been reassured that if a prototype can be built in @entity48 , it will be possible to launch the concept more cheaply elsewhere			0
the @entity12 scheme would need a six - mile sea wall up to 65ft high - although only half of this would be noticeable from land at low tide , according to @entity70			2
budget announcement : mr @entity5 ( file picture ) is expected to reveal that the government is beginning formal talks on funding the project to produce energy from turbines in @entity12 other project : the @entity50 power company will get the opportunity to discuss subsidies - which are expected to have to be about £ 150 per megawatt hour			1
controversially , this is far greater than the £ 98 per mwh subsidy agreed for the planned @entity58 nuclear plant @entity59 ( above , artist 's impression ) the wall would create a lagoon in the @entity89 with turbines that could harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day			1
the developers say the project , along with four others , could meet 10 per cent of our electricity needs from the tides by 2023			2
the six - mile wall around @entity12 complete with turbines could generate electricity 14 hours a day			1
@entity70 believes the project will boost a @entity102 supply chain and create a new export market if it gets the go - ahead			0
the project includes creating a six - mile sea reef , the reintroduction of the native oyster to @entity12 and a visitor centre			1
there are claims that it would save 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year , as well as create 1,850 construction jobs and 150 long - term jobs in its operation			0
when plans were first submitted last year , it was claimed that the ground - breaking project could provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in @entity12 for 120 years			1
developers behind the project believe it could be the first step in developing lagoon technology that could meet 10 per cent of the @entity102 's electricity needs from the tides by 2023			2
@entity70 said it hopes that 65 per cent of expenditure will be in the @entity102 , boosting a home grown supply chain and creating a possible future export market			0
the project includes creating a six - mile sea reef , the reintroduction of the native oyster to @entity12 and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities			1
it is claimed that building more , larger lagoons would bring economies of scale			0
other sites where lagoons are being considered , such as the @entity58 coast , could have added benefits such as flood defences			0
last month it was reported that the plan had been given a funding boost after investment management firm @entity149 agreed to provide £ 100million for the project			2
but , also last month , consumer charity @entity151 said the project was ‘ appalling value for money ’ and should not receive subsidies .			0
