nuclear fusion has been described as the ' holy grail ' of energy , a source of power that could solve the world 's impending fuel crisis			1
now we may be a step closer to achieving it after @entity10 announced a ' breakthrough ' in developing a power source based on the technology			0
the @entity15 - based company said the first reactors , small enough to fit on the back of a truck , could be ready for use in a decade			0
@entity10 claims reactors , small enough to fit on the back of a truck , could be in use in a decade nuclear fission breaks a single atom into two , while nuclear fusion combines two atoms into one			1
the latter process creates three to four times as much energy as fission			0
@entity40 , who heads the project , said he and a small team had been working on fusion energy at @entity10 's secretive @entity44 for about four years , they are now going public to find potential partners in industry and government for their work			1
initial work demonstrated the feasibility of building a 100 - megawatt reactor measuring 7ft ( 2.1 metres ) by 10ft ( 3 metres ) , which could fit on the back of a large truck			0

pictured is a fusion expert at @entity10 this is about 10 times smaller than current reactors , mr @entity40 told reporters at a recent press conference			0
fusion works by using two kinds of hydrogen atoms — deuterium and tritium — and injecting that gas into a containment vessel			0
@entity78 then add energy that removes the electrons from their host atoms , forming what is described as an ion plasma			0
the key to @entity10 's system is their tube - like design , which allows them to get around one of the limitations of traditional fusion reactor designs , that are limited by the amount plasma they can hold			1
@entity10 has found a way to constrain the plasma , using what is called a compact fusion reactor ( @entity96 ) with a specifically shaped magnetic field inside			1
when the plasma tries to expand the magnetic field fights back to contain it			0
in effect , this means the plasma works to contain itself			0
the company , the @entity104 's largest supplier , said it would build and test a compact fusion reactor in less than a year , and build a prototype in five years			1
in recent years , @entity10 has become increasingly involved in a variety of alternate energy projects , including several ocean energy projects , as it looks to offset a decline in @entity113 and @entity114 military spending			2
@entity10 's work on fusion energy could help in developing new power sources amid increasing global conflicts over energy , and as projections show there will be a 40 per cent to 50 per cent increase in energy use over the next generation , mr @entity40 said			1
engineers have designed a a fusion reactor which , when scaled up , would rival costs for a new coal - fired plant with similar electrical output a fuel with no greenhouse emissions or radioactive waste that is almost unlimited , sounds too good to be true			1
but scientists have taken one more step to make fusion power useful and affordable			2
engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor which , when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant , would rival costs for a new coal - fired plant with similar electrical output			1
fusion , the process that powers the sun and other stars , entails forging the nuclei of atoms to release energy , as opposed to splitting them , which is fission - the principle behind the atomic bomb and nuclear power			1
engineers from the @entity156 have published their design and analysis findings and will present them at the @entity160 's @entity159 in @entity161 , @entity162 , this week			2
the design builds on existing technology and creates a magnetic field within a closed space to hold plasma in place long enough for fusion to occur - allowing the hot plasma to react and burn			2
the reactor itself would be largely self - sustaining , meaning it would continuously heat the plasma to maintain thermonuclear conditions			0
heat generated from the reactor would heat up a coolant that is used to spin a turbine and generate electricity , similar to how a typical power reactor works			2
' right now , this design has the greatest potential of producing economical fusion power of any current concept , ' said @entity184 , a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the university			2
if it proves feasible , @entity10 's work would mark a key breakthrough in a field that scientists have long eyed as promising , but which has not yet yielded viable power systems			1
the effort seeks to harness the energy released during nuclear fusion , when atoms combine into more stable forms			1
' we can make a big difference on the energy front , ' mr @entity40 added , noting @entity10 's 60 years of research on nuclear fusion as a potential energy source			1
compact nuclear fusion would produce far less waste than coal - powered plants since it would use deuterium - tritium fuel , which can generate nearly 10 million times more energy than the same amount of fossil fuels , the company said			1
pictured are the magnetic coils inside the compact fusion experiment by @entity10			1
@entity10 said it had shown it could complete a design , buildand test it in as little as a year , which should produce anoperational reactor in 10 years ultra-dense deuterium , an isotope of hydrogen , is found in the @entity220 's oceans , and tritium is made from natural lithium deposits			1
nuclear fusion is a process by which the nuclei of deuterium and tritium , both isotopes obtained from hydrogen , are fused together to create heavier particles			2
in theory , energy generated through fusion would leave no dangerous waste or pollute the atmosphere			0
and the fuel is found in abundance in seawater , which covers more than two - thirds of the planet			0
the process requires extreme temperatures and pressure equivalent to those found on our @entity245 and other active stars			0
it said future reactors could use a different fuel and eliminate radioactive waste completely			0
mr @entity40 said the company had several patents pending for the work and was looking for partners in academia , industry and among government laboratories to advance the work			0
@entity10 said it had shown it could complete a design , build and test it in as little as a year , which should produce an operational reactor in 10 years			1
a small reactor could power a @entity267 warship , and eliminate the need for other fuel sources that pose logistical challenges			1
@entity113 submarines and aircraft carriers run on nuclear power , but they have large fission reactors on board that have to be replaced on a regular cycle			0
' what makes our project really interesting and feasible is that timeline as a potential solution , ' mr @entity40 added			0
nuclear fission breaks one atom into two , while nuclear fusion combines two atoms into one			2
the latter process creates four times as much energy as fission			0
pictured is a computer model of a fusion reactor however , there was some skepticism over the viability of the design			1
dr @entity299 is @entity297 at @entity298 said : ' certainly , i 'd welcome fusion as part of the world 's energy mix , but this announcement is a long way from a working prototype , let alone a commercially viable power generator			1
' @entity309 requires incredibly high temperatures and pressures , which is challenging , and a lot of people have been working on fusion for a long time			2
so i wo n't get too excited yet			0
' professor @entity315 is a research fellow and leader of the @entity317 at the @entity318 said the technology was necessary to avoid dangerous climate change			0
' nuclear energy is low carbon , and will be an important part of the electricity generation fleet in various countries around the world where other low carbon alternatives are not viable , ' he said			2
' the potential for the use of fusion reactors over fission is exciting news as the dangerous by - products of fission reactors are a major disadvantage of the technology			0

@entity317 said it to plans test a compact fusion reactor in less than a year
it then hopes to build a prototype of its device in around five years
nuclear fusion is regarded by many as solution to world 's energy crisis
for *instance* , a small reactor could power an entire @entity267 warship
however , there was some skepticism over the viability of the design
@entity299 an energy *consultant* said : ' this announcement is a long way from a working prototype , let alone a commercially viable power generator '
