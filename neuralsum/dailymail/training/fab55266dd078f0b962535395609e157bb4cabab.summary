with @entity0 seriously considering another go at the presidency , @entity2 presidential hopefuls are ratcheting up their attacks on the 2012 nominee 's last campaign , aiming to blast enough holes in the former @entity17 governor 's possible bid to sink it before it sets ashore			1
but @entity0 's close friends and backers say his faith may be driving him to run again anyway			1

” ' speaking at the same forum @entity42 sen. @entity41 blamed @entity0 's infamous ' 47 percent ' comment and the rationale behind it for the @entity2 's loss in 2012			1
' i think @entity0 is a good and decent and honorable man , and i think he ran a very hard campaign , ' @entity41 began			2
' but the central narrative of the last election , what the voters heard , was " we do n't have to worry about the 47 percent			1
" ' and i think that @entity2 are and should be the party of the 47 percent , ' he argued			1
@entity0 - along with former @entity53 gov. @entity52 - has become a pinata for republicans considering presidential campaigns in recent days as they angle to present themselves as the @entity2 's best foot forward heading in the 2016 general election			1

' sunday at the @entity80 gathering in @entity81 @entity31 said of @entity0 , ' i think he 's a good man , he 's a generous man , and he would have been a great president			1
he would have been much better than this president			0
' but to win the presidency , ' he said , ' you have to reach out and appeal to new constituencies , and i just do n't think it 's possible [ for @entity0 to do that			1
] ' if he thinks well , i 'm just going to change a few themes , and next time , i 'll reach out to more people than that ... i think it 's a little more visceral than that , how you connect with people , ' he continued			0
@entity31 said he 's ' just not sure ' @entity0 would be able to make that kind of connection ' with enough people to win a general election			1
' @entity32 sen. @entity31 trolled @entity0 and former @entity53 gov. @entity52 on thursday after it was announced that the two so - called establishment candidate would meet privately			1

' ' you do n't want to give a person like that a second chance			2
... they 'll absolutely lose to the @entity114 , ' @entity100 added , referring to both @entity0 and @entity52 , a first - time presidential candidate himself but the third person in his immediate family to pursue the @entity118			1
' i just do n't think they can win , ' he said			0

' i ca n’t wait for new energy , ' the 2008 vice presidential nominee - turned reality tv star said , joking			0
@entity103 said she 'd be ' interested ' in running for president next year but stressed that she does n't necessarily need to be a candidate			0

' ' i think he 's a good man , he 's a generous man , and he would have been a great president , ' @entity31 said sunday night during a forum at a @entity139 meeting in @entity81 , @entity34 , that was aired in part by @entity127			0
' but to win the presidency , ' he said , ' you have to reach out and appeal to new constituencies , and i just do n't think it 's possible [ for @entity0 to do that			1
] ' if @entity0 does run , his @entity148 faith will be contributing factor , allies say			2
his contemplation of a third presidential campaign comes from an ' almost devout belief that he needs to do something for this country , ' @entity150 , a fellow @entity151 and the former chair or @entity0 's political action committee told the @entity159			2
' in the @entity151 faith , public service is one of the most honorable things you do — to participate in local and national politics is a very honorable thing to do , ' said @entity63 rep. @entity166 , a @entity0 advocate who the @entity159 says has spoken recently with the @entity2 politician			2
' the idea of try and try again is something that ’s ingrained in the religion , ' as well , he noted			0
@entity150 said another attempt at higher office would also give @entity0 a platform to testify about his faith - something he did n't do in previous campaigns			2
' in 2008 , @entity0 risked being a caricature of the @entity151 candidate , ' he said			0
' now everyone seems to know everything about him , and that will be very liberating for him to talk about his faith			0
' should @entity0 make it his mission to win the @entity2 nomination again in 2016 , early polling shows he 'd be well positioned			2
nearly a third of @entity2 voters and right leaning independents in first in the nation state @entity191 say they 'd vote for @entity0 again if the primary were held now			2
@entity0 also tops @entity106 voters ' lists			0
he lead his closest potential rival , @entity52 , by seven points in a recent @entity198 poll			0
a @entity200 survey released in december showed that @entity0 could n't beat @entity201 in a general election match - up if she were to also run and win her party 's nomination , but he , @entity52 and @entity206 gov. @entity205 would have the best odds			0
the three republicans would lose to @entity209 by six points , the poll found			0
@entity31 would take an eight - point lashing , and @entity41 would face a double - digit whooping of 13 percentage points .			0

@entity31 invoked @entity0 's wife and said : ' i ’m kind of with @entity39 on this one : " no , no , no , no , never ” '
@entity41 blamed @entity0 's infamous ' 47 percent ' comment and the rationale behind it for the @entity2 's loss in 2012
