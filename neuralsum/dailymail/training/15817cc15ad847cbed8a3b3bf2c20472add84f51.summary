and then appeared as a sub again with 10 minutes to go in their last - eight match as they lost against the host nation			0
@entity61 was one of those to praise @entity4 last year , saying : ‘ i watched the @entity63 and there was a kid called ( @entity4 ) @entity4 playing for @entity5			2
‘ the way he receives the ball , you do n’t really see young players in our country doing that			0
' however , another of @entity4 's representatives , @entity73 , claims the 21 - year - old will not leave @entity2 unless his buy - out is triggered , though he says his client has a number of suitors throughout @entity81			1

' of course , there are clubs interested			0
there is a lot of interest from clubs from @entity90 and @entity19 in the player			0
