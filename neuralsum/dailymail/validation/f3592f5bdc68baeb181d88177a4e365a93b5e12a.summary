they are some of the richest habitats on the planet yet also the hardest for humans to inhabit			0
now scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought			1
researchers at @entity8 found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of @entity12 in southern @entity13			1
scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought			1
researchers at @entity8 found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of @entity12 in southern @entity13 ( pictured ) they say isotopes in the teeth suggest the people they belonged to had a diet mainly composed of food foraged from the forest			1
the study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago			1
neanderthals may have created and worn the world 's first jewellery 130,000 years ago , according to scientists			2
researchers examining eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at @entity34 in @entity35 say they were used to create necklace or bracelet			0
the claws bear multiple cut marks , notches and signs that they had been polishing by the @entity27 that once inhabited the site where they were found			0
anthropologists at the @entity45 say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in @entity48			0
the findings add to mounting evidence that @entity27 were not the slow - witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as			0
the findings contradict the idea that tropical rainforests were largely human - free environments until around 8,000 years ago			1
professor @entity57 , an archaeologist at @entity8 who helped lead the study , said : ' the isotopic methodology applied in our study has already been successfully used to study how primates , including @entity64 great apes , adapt to their forest environment			0
' however , this is the first time scientists have investigated ancient human fossils in a tropical forest context to see how our earliest ancestors survived in such a habitat			2
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity75 , studied the fossilised teeth of 26 humans of a range of dates - from 20,000 to 3,000 years ago - found around @entity13			1
the areas where they were excavated from are all now dense rainforest but it was not clear what the landscape was like when the people were alive			0
by examining the carbon and oxygen isotopes in the teeth , the researchers were able to see that the humans had a diet that matched those of people living in slightly open ' intermediate rainforest ' environments			1
the study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago			1
rainforests , like in @entity13 above , may teem with life but beneath the trees life can be hard for humans			2
the findings contradict the idea that such rainforests were largely human - free until 8,000 years ago the teeth were found in rainforests in southern @entity13 including in the @entity111 cave ( marked ) @entity112 , an archaeology student at @entity8 and lead author of the study , said : ' this is the first study to directly test how much early human forest foragers depended on the rainforest for their diet			1
' the results are significant in showing that early humans in @entity13 were able to live almost entirely on food found in the rainforest without the need to move into other environments			2
' our earliest human ancestors were clearly able to successfully adapt to different extreme environments			0
' professor @entity128 , who also took part in the study at @entity8 , added : ' our research provides a clear timeline showing the deep level of interaction that early humans had with the rainforest in @entity137			0
' we need further research to see if this pattern was also followed in other similar environments in @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity64			0
' this tooth , also found at the @entity111 cave in @entity13 may be even older than the ones in the study analysis of teeth found at @entity150 in @entity13 show the people that lived her survived in the rainforest			2

scientists at @entity8 analysed isotopes in ancient human teeth
the teeth were excavated in the rainforests of @entity12 in @entity13
researchers found the teeth belonged to humans who ate a rainforest diet
this means humans lived in rainforests 12,000 years earlier than thought
rainforests were largely thought to be human free until 8,000 years ago
