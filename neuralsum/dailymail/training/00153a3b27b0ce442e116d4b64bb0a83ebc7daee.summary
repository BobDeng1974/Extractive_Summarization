in @entity2 's own words , six years a go he ' looked like i 'd swallowed a sheep			1
' the @entity5 was ' fat , sick and nearly dead ' - he weighed 22 stone and was suffering from a debilitating autoimmune disease that meant he was constantly dosed up on drugs			1
his daily diet consisted of pizza , pies and doughnuts - leaving him low on energy and on a fast track to an early grave			2
he set himself the challenge of only consuming juice for 60 days to see if the healing power of fruit and veg could make him a new man			1
he told the @entity34 : ' i was sick and on medication that was n't fixing me			0
i just wanted to get well and be healthy			0
i decided to see if i could change my life by completely by changing my diet and plying my system with nutrients			2
then and now : @entity2 used to weigh 22st , left , and was in poor health before he ' rebooted ' and lost six stone ' for 60 days i would only drink juice			1
then for the next two years after that , i 'd only eat foods derived from plants ( seeds , beans , fruits , veg and nuts ) and no animal - based or processed food			0
' the plan worked and @entity2 lost six stone			2
six years on , aged 47 , he is now medication - free and has never felt better			2
his daily diet continues to include a litre of juice a day along with plant - based foods during the day and an evening meal that will include animal and processed foods			1
he filmed his journey to create the award - winning documentary , @entity64 , that will air on @entity65 on 10th july			0
the film has been a worldwide hit and has inspired many to follow @entity2 's lead with juicing now becoming a way of life for many			1
celebrities including @entity73 and @entity74 have accredited their physiques to a juice diet and @entity77 has seen a 130 per cent rise in sales of juicers in the past year			1
celeb followers : actresses @entity74 , left , and @entity73 are fans of the juice diet prep time : 5 @entity84 : 16oz			1
( 500 mls ) ingredients directions @entity87 , head of buying for electricals at @entity77 , said : ' the juicing phenomenon is spreading fast across the @entity90			0
' juicing is a huge trend for us this year and in response to high levels of customer demand for juicers we have increased our stock holding by 10 times compared to last year , and expanded our range			0
' however , @entity2 prefers to call his juicing plan a ' reboot ' rather than a diet - and anyone can do it to improve their health			1
he said : ' during a reboot , you 'll commit to consuming only fruit and vegetable juices for a period of time			0
three days , five days , or 30 days , it 's your choice ! ' the goal is to help you break a cycle of an unhealthy lifestyle and simply enhance the quality of your diet by increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables			2
' he added : ' if you 're overweight and have tried everything then i would recommend consulting your doctor and then following the juice diet for ten days			1
' you 'll find you 'll fall in love with fruit and veg and the way it makes you feel			0
' but @entity2 said a ' reboot ' does n't have to be ' all or nothing '			2
' if you do n't want to only have juice for a certain number of days then just try adding it into your diet instead			1
' having a litre a day of fruit and veg every morning will make you feel better and lose pounds			0
it will also fill you up so you feel satisfied and wo n't want to eat as much during the day , ' he explained			0
@entity2 believes juicing is the easiest way to stock your body up on vitamins and the juices are easy to make - just wash , cut and blend			1
for those short on time , he recommends juicing in bulk at the weekend and then storing the juice in the fridge in an air - tight container so it 's ready for you to drink every morning during the week			0
