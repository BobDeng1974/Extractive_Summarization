by @entity0 published : 12:33 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 13:30 est , 7 march 2014 the majestic moons and @entity3 are thought to hold the key to understanding the origins of the universe			0
and now @entity7 has been able to capture the planet ’s dazzling rings in unprecedented detail , along with its ' @entity12 ' moon seen glowing in the distance			1
the space agency ’s @entity15 probe took this image on october 22 , 2013 , when it was about 1.6 million miles ( 2.6 million km ) from @entity19			1
among the interplay of @entity19 's shadow and rings , @entity23 , which appears in the lower - right corner of the image , orbits @entity19 as a set of the ever - intriguing spokes appear in the b ring ( just to the right of centre ) the planet ’s @entity31 , also known as the ‘ @entity12 ’ because of its resemblance to the space station , is visible as a pin prick of light at the bottom right			1
the image also shows the mysterious ‘ spokes ’ in @entity19 's b ring , just to the right of centre			1
what creates these spokes is still a mystery , but scientists do know that the spokes no longer appear when the sun is higher in @entity19 's sky			1
‘ it is believed that this has to do with the ability of micron - sized ring grains to maintain an electrical charge and levitate above the rings , forming spokes , ’ @entity7 said			2
@entity19 's @entity31 , also known as the ‘ @entity12 ’ can be seen as a pin prick of light ( circled in red ) in the right image			1
the left image highlights the ' mysterious ' spokes ' on the planet 's rings @entity19 's moon @entity23 peeps out from behind the larger moon @entity65 in this view from the @entity15 spacecraft			1
@entity23 ( 246 miles , or 396 kilometres across ) is near the bottom center of the image			2
@entity19 's rings are also visible in the top right an image taken by @entity15 in 2012			1
a shadow cast by @entity75 across the a ring as @entity19 's own shadow block light from the lower part of the rings ( bottom right )			1
@entity15 captured the view at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles from @entity19 @entity19 and her rings as the rings cast shadows on the planet			1
@entity7 's probe @entity15 captured the view at a distance of approximately 621,000 miles from @entity19 in a talk at @entity92 in december , professor @entity89 of @entity90 said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from @entity7 's @entity15 spacecraft			2
the mysterious object , which was located at the right edge of @entity19 's a ring , has been named ' @entity99 ' after professor @entity89 's mother - in - law launched in 1997 , @entity15 has been exploring @entity19 and its series of moons since 2004			1
on @entity19 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity105 years , meaning @entity15 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity19 year			0
since 2004 , @entity19 and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer			0
@entity15 has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004 , also observing @entity112 , the heliosphere , and testing the theory of relativity			0
@entity15 is the fourth space probe to visit @entity19 and the first to enter orbit			2
@entity23 is an inner moon of @entity19 and averages 246 miles ( 396 km ) in diameter			1
@entity23 and another @entity19 moon , @entity121 , have been called ‘ the most heavily cratered body in the solar system			1
’ based on data gathered from the @entity15 spacecraft , scientists last year estimated that @entity19 ’s rings date back more than four billion years			2
its images have provided some surprises for scientists in the past few years			0
for instance in a talk at @entity92 in december , professor @entity89 of @entity90 said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from @entity7 ’s @entity15 spacecraft			0
the mysterious object , which was located at the right edge of @entity19 ’s a ring , has been named ‘ @entity99 ’ after professor @entity89 ’s mother - in - law			2
@entity99 is thought to be about a 0.6 miles ( 1km ) in diameter , which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon			0
it could , however , be the build - up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight			0
some of @entity19 ’s moons , particularly those orbiting near the rings , are thought to have formed in this way , creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow			2
the planet is known to have of 53 natural rings with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings			0
some moons , such as @entity159 and @entity160 , interact with ring material , shepherding the ring in its orbit			0
scientists have used this image to analyse mysterious propeller shapes which frequently appear within the rings			0
based on data gathered from the @entity15 spacecraft , scientists last year estimated that @entity172 s rings date back more than four billion years this image was released by @entity7 in 2012			0
the image was made possible by @entity15 changing its orbit for the first time in two years			0
@entity15 is the fourth space probe to visit @entity19 and the first to enter orbit			0

*cassini* probe took the image on october 22 , 2013 , when it was about 1.6 million miles ( 2.6 million km ) from @entity19
the planet ’s *scarred* moon @entity23 , also known as the @entity12 , is visible as a pin prick of light at the bottom right
image also shows the ‘ spokes ’ in the b ring , the right of centre , which only appear when sun is low in @entity19 's sky
