by @entity0 a @entity3 immigrant who killed his wife for feeding him lentils should be given a short sentence because the lack of home - style food will make jail ' difficult ' , a court was told			1
@entity11 , 75 , beat his wife to death with a stick in their @entity15 apartment in 2011 , and was convicted of the killing in may			1
earlier the @entity18 heard how he lashed out at @entity19 , 66 , because she made him a vegetarian lentil dinner instead of cooking goat			2
in papers submitted to the court , prosecutors said : ' the defendant asked [ his wife ] to cook goat and [ his wife ] said she made something else			2
fussy eater : @entity11 ( centre ) , pictured at the @entity18 , was convicted of killing his wife after she made him the wrong dinner ' the conversation got louder and his wife disrespected defendant by cursing at defendant and saying motherf * * * * * and that the defendant took a wooden stick and hit her with it on her arm and mouth			1
' and food again returned to the centre of the trial in arguments over sentencing - when defense lawyers for @entity11 said he should be given a shorter sentence because of the hardship of doing without @entity3 food			1
attorney @entity53 wrote in papers submitted to court : ' his inability to speak @entity56 and his inability to have @entity3 food will make his incarceration even more difficult than the average inmate			0
' she argued that on that basis he should be given 15 years in prison , rather than the maximum of 25 , the @entity60 reported			0
prosecutors dismissed their arguments , saying there were no ' mitigating factors ' , and said the maximum sentence should be given			0
in a hearing yesterday , @entity72 @entity71 gave @entity11 18 years , which he said is likely to be a life sentence because of the killer 's age			1
wrangles : the court ( pictured ) heard that the hardship of going without @entity3 food in prison ought to mean @entity11 is given a short sentence			1
he was eventually given 18 years inside in an emotional speech to the court , given via a @entity87 translator , @entity11 denied killing his wife , then begged for death himself			1
he said : ' please do me justice and hang me			0
give me electric shock so i can die			0
' earlier in the trial it had been argued that @entity11 had n't meant to kill his wife , and also that his lashing out at her was unremarkable because wife beating is routine in @entity3			2
the court was told gruesome details of the attack , with prosecutor @entity99 describing how @entity11 attacked his wife as she lay in her bed			2
she said he left deep lacerations on her head , arms and shoulders , and causing her brain to haemorrhage			0
court papers state he beat her with a stick that the family had found in the street and used to stir their laundry in a washtub			0
he then tried to clean up the blood that splattered onto their bedroom wall before calling his son for help , @entity99 said .			0

@entity11 beat his wife to death after she failed to feed him goat in 2011
convicted in may , but lawyers say lack of home food is an *extra* hardship
they said he should have *lenient* 15 - year sentence ; judge gave him 18
