something odd is going on this year in @entity1 - and it has to do with the rows of empty sunbeds			1
with the rouble in trouble , @entity4 are freezing at home , rather than sizzling in @entity9 's flop - in - the - sun western state			1
sorry to be mean , but it 's all too good to be true for the rest of us			1
@entity13 : @entity14 is one of the many relaxed stretches of shoreline along the edge of @entity1 the beaches are more relaxed , the restaurants and bars quieter , the accessories less shiny			1
my friend @entity23 and i find direct flights for £ 348 return through @entity27			2
on arrival , we head for @entity30 , in the north , for three nights at @entity33			0
our seaside accommodation , with en - suite bathroom , is chic and tucked away in palm trees			0
we 're paying £ 49 each for three nights			0
you wo n't find those prices in the @entity40			0
on the beach , @entity41 peddling pedicures and sarongs smile and tell us we are ' very pale ' , adding : ' you wo n't stay that way for long			1
' even without the @entity4 , the beach is a hive of activity			1
there are yoga and pilates classes , massage sessions , trinket sellers , football kick - arounds , frisbee games , joggers			0
watching the sunset on @entity59 's neighbour - is spectacular , after which we take a ten - minute ride on a tuk - tuk taxi back to our hotel			2
@entity1 has 11 hours of sunshine a day at this time of year			1
and it retains something of its @entity69 flavour , a leftover from its days as a @entity73 colony for 450 years			0
one of its greatest assets is the food			0
the ball 's in your court : @entity1 has a famously relaxed ambience , and is a real favourite with tourists you can eat famously here for no more than £ 20 a head			1
after a few days in the north , we take a two - and - a - half - hour taxi ( £ 27 ) to @entity88 in the south and fetch up at @entity90 - a smattering of beach cottages costing £ 50 a night			2
it 's altogether livelier here , with music blaring and enough nightlife to keep the most earnest raver happy			2
@entity98 , a ten - minute drive away , is gloriously serene , with one solitary bar			0
its genial owner looks a little downcast			0
his displeasure is our fortune			0
which is to say that he hopes the rouble revives and the @entity4 return			1
@entity27 ( 0203 451 2688 , www.thomson.co.uk ) and @entity109 ( 01733 224 800 , www.thomascook.com ) both fly direct to @entity1 from £ 336 return			1
a standard cottage at @entity33 ( 0091 832 651 0392 , www.yabyumresorts.com ) costs from £ 35 a night @entity112 , and at @entity113 's ( 0091 832 264 3477 , www.ciarans.com ) from £ 40 a night .			2

@entity1 is @entity9 's smallest state but one of its most *popular* travel *destinations*
it offers *bargain* beach breaks ( and *luxury* too ) in the west of the country
@entity123 means there are currently fewer @entity4 *visitors* than usual
