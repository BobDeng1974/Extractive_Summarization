@entity1 academics are working on unlocking the secrets of a mystery medieval civilization on the edge of the @entity5 - which had links to @entity7			1
a burial ground has been found with human remains mummified seemingly by accident - and wearing copper masks			1
but who they were remains a puzzle to @entity1 archeologists and experts			1
a red haired man was found , protected from chest to foot by copper plating , among a group of bodies in a mysterious burial ground in northern @entity1 a genetic study will now be carried out on the remains in a bid to solve the riddle of where the people came from a total of 34 shallow graves have been excavated by archeologists at @entity33 , 18 miles south of the @entity34 , and included a small treasure trove of jewellery and artifacts indicating this was a trading outpost of some importance around one millennium ago			1
' the medieval necropolis include 11 bodies with shattered or missing skulls , and smashed skeletons , ' reported @entity45			0
' five mummies were found to be shrouded in copper , while also elaborately covered in reindeer , beaver , wolverine or bear fur			1
' among the graves is just one female , a child , her face masked by copper plates			0
there are no adult women			0
' three copper masked infant mummies - all male - were unearthed nearby			2
they were bound in four or five copper hoops , several centimetres wide			0
a red - haired man was also found , protected from chest to foot by copper plating			2
in his resting place , was an iron hatchet , furs , and a head buckle made of bronze depicting a bear			0
a total 34 shallow graves were uncovered by archeologists working at @entity33 , @entity1 , which is 18 miles south of the @entity34 as well as copper plating , the bodies were covered in reindeer , beaver , wolverine and bear fur the feet of the deceased are all pointing towards the nearby @entity83 , a fact which is seen as having religious significance			1
yet the burial rituals are reported to be unknown to experts and not typical of others in this cold and inhospitable region			2
artifacts included bronze bowls originating in @entity7 , some 3,700 miles to the south - west , dating from the tenth or eleventh centuries , it is believed			1
' one of the burials dates to 1282 , according to a study of tree rings , while others are believed to be older , ' reports @entity45			0
a bronze bowl ( top left ) and a silver plate found beside the burials and silver medallions and other decorations ( right ) a belt and bracelet from the burial			2
artifacts found have led experts to link the people with @entity7 , thousands of miles to the south an iron combat knife , silver medallion and a bronze bird figurine was found by one of the adult mummies and are understood to date from the seventh to the ninth centuries			1
it is thought the preservation of the bodies was ' an accident ' caused by a combination of the copper , which prevented oxidation of the remains , and a dip in temperatures in the centuries after the group were buried			1
@entity130 , of the @entity132 branch of the @entity133 , said : ' nowhere in the world are there so many mummified remains found outside the permafrost or the marshes			2
the group , buried around 800 years ago , are thought to have been mummified ' by accident ' due to the copper plating placed around their bodies a belt buckle from the burial , which experts are continuing to investigate ' it is a unique archaeological site			1
we are pioneers in everything from taking away the object of sandy soil ( which has not been done previously ) and ending with the possibility of further research			0
' she suggested that the smashing of the skulls may have been done soon after death ' to render protection from mysterious spells believed to emanate from the deceased '			0
in 2002 , archeologists were forced to halt work at the site due to objections by locals on the @entity163 , a land of reindeer and energy riches known to locals as ' the end of the earth '			0
the experts were disturbing the souls of their ancestors , they feared			0
work is underway now to solve this riddle , including a genetic study of the remains headed by @entity176 , research fellow of @entity177 , part of the @entity133 .			0

archeologists unearth mysterious tribe of people south of the @entity34
experts say they were mummified ' by *mistake* ' by copper used in burial ritual
it is thought the group share almost no *customs* with other nearby groups
some of the artifacts found suggest links to @entity7 , around 3,700 miles away
