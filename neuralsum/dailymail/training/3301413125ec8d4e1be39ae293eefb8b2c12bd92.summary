of course , the team did win three three @entity94 while eating @entity96 's hamburgers for lunch in 1980s and early 1990s			2
' but they were also smoking cigarettes and drinking malt liquor , " tight end @entity98 said			2
" the culture 's changed			2
it 's another resource that 20 years ago was n't really looked into , and now it is			1

for lunch , @entity64 comes up with inventive , healthy ways to cook fish , chicken or turkey and occasionally beef			2
a recovery smoothie is waiting at every player 's locker after practice			2
' @entity185 ' and ' tropical ' are popular flavors , although @entity98 goes for the more exotic ' kale			0

i get all the time , i 'll stand here and they 'll say , ' well , which one 's better ? ' and i 'll say , ' this one			1
' they 'll say , ' but i do n't want that one			0
' i 'll say , ' you did n't ask me what you wanted , you asked me what was better , and this is better			0
'' quarterback @entity217 has been known to text @entity143 from a grocery store to ask which product is a healthier choice			0
veteran @entity221 brought in a recipe for garlic crab legs from his native @entity224 , and @entity64 cooked it as a special meal for the receivers			0

' no one said anything			0
we went 75 - 25			1
