the collapse in @entity2 's relationship with @entity3 was rooted in his dismay at the quality of @entity7 players signed by the club			1
when names like @entity11 , @entity12 and to a lesser extent @entity14 were signed , he could barely disguise his contempt , feeling none of them would help him take on @entity18 and @entity19 in the @entity20			1
' @entity21 , ' he would spit out when asked about the club 's transfer policy , referring to the club 's then - football administrator @entity24 who was responsible at the time for buying players			2
@entity28 defender @entity27 has been linked with a move to @entity3 @entity2 was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on , @entity24 has a new role at the academy with a @entity32 , @entity33 , in his old job with the title director of football			1
and yet the dilemma remains the same : how do @entity3 buy enough top @entity7 players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking @entity40 ( financial fair play ) regulations again ? it wo n't be easy and could explain why @entity3 – who have slumped to fourth in the league – are being linked with less glamorous names like @entity27 and @entity47			1
good players certainly , but good enough ? probably not			2
it 's a sobering thought that @entity12 made only seven @entity50 starts in two seasons for @entity3 after a £ 12million move from @entity53			1
@entity11 started just twice after signing from @entity54 and is currently on loan at @entity56			1
plenty of things at @entity3 have been carefully planned and executed well since the club 's owners from @entity61 took over in 2008			1
( from left ) @entity3 director of football @entity33 , assistant manager @entity64 , manager @entity65 and former football administrator @entity24 the @entity66 is a glittering monument to football development and helping the community , while two @entity50 titles , the @entity71 and @entity72 is an excellent trophy haul considering where the club have come from			1
but one weakness has been in their approach to having enough homegrown players , lagging behind most of their rivals			2
@entity82 manager @entity81 signed @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 and @entity86 bought @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 as teenagers			1
most spectacularly , @entity91 bought players like @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 and invested in making them better			1
spurs have brought through @entity97 and @entity98 from their academy			0
only @entity100 face similar issues to @entity3			1
homegrown rules are complicated and differ slightly between competitions			0
@entity11 ( left ) and @entity12 are two @entity7 players who were bought by @entity3 in the @entity50 , you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25			1
homegrown players can be born overseas as long as they have been at a club 's academy three years before the age of 21			2
if clubs ca n't find eight , they have to reduce their squad accordingly , as @entity100 have had to this season			0
under 21 players can be named in the squad in addition to the 25			2
@entity3 's six @entity50 homegrown players are : @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 and there lies a major problem for next season			1
@entity123 is definitely off and @entity124 is out of contract too			0
@entity122 has endured a poor season and @entity3 will want a new left - back while @entity121 , a @entity131 who has been at @entity3 since he was 16 , is not good enough to win a regular first - team place			1
the feeling is he was only offered his latest contract because he filled one of the homegrown slots			2
ditto , third - choice goalkeeper @entity120			0
@entity86 signed both @entity87 ( left ) and @entity89 as teenagers the @entity20 squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in @entity141 , but four of those must have come through the ranks at @entity3			1
@entity121 was their only club - trained player named this season			0
it will be a major problem for the club next season as their one - season punishment ( for breaching @entity153 rules ) to name a squad of 21 is lifted and they can name 25 again			0
these will be issues exercising the minds at the very top of the club			0
but whichever way they look at it , @entity3 have three options which carry a downside : 1 ) spend big on the best @entity7 players 2 ) find their own from their academy or 3 ) buy cheaper @entity7 players who might not be good enough			1
@entity94 ( left ) and @entity93 are two players @entity91 bought to boost their @entity7 quota for option one , supply and demand is a problem			1
there are probably only three @entity141 players most people would call good international - class and therefore worthy of a place in the @entity3 team should they want to win titles at home and abroad			1
@entity119 is already there , @entity87 is at @entity86 and presumably unattainable while @entity95 would be a premium price			1
' can you get @entity95 ? maybe if you go to @entity91 with £ 100million you can , ' complained @entity65 recently			1
no wonder @entity3 appear ready to open negotiations at £ 50m			1
@entity187 is one of the young players at @entity3 who is tipped to go on to big things midfielder @entity187 ticks all the boxes for what @entity3 hope to achieve in the future			1
a box - to - box midfielder from @entity194 , he joined @entity3 at the age of 11 and has gone on to be an @entity141 youth international at different age levels			1
aged 18 , he has played for @entity199 's under - 21 elite development squad this season , and played five matches in @entity3 's run to the quarter - finals of the @entity204 , a @entity20 equivalent for under - 20s			2
the last @entity194 to play regularly for @entity3 was @entity208 and he had to retire early after injury problems			2
of the next generation , £ 60m has been quoted for @entity53 's @entity211 , a huge price for unproven talent			0
@entity97 would be an interesting target as would @entity53 's @entity216 defender @entity215 , who might represent the best value - for - money			0
@entity218 has had injury problems			0
@entity3 's academy cost £ 200m but so far none has broken into the first - team squad regularly			2
@entity223 is on loan at @entity225 and may move there permanently			0
@entity226 has played @entity20 football for @entity228			0
@entity3 will hope starlets like @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity187 will become their homegrown first - teamers of the future , but they are unlikely to make a major contribution next season			1
@entity187 is novel and interesting , he is from @entity194 and has been likened to @entity207			0
@entity211 is one of the most hotly tipped players in @entity141 and worth in the region of £ 60m the third option is to try and sign any @entity50 player who is available			2
it might not be the best idea for the players themselves , @entity14 said after he was sold to @entity248 that the move to @entity3 can turn sour for young players			1
' it is a lot different when you do n't play			0
the novelty wears off , definitely , ' he said			0
@entity12 is now at @entity248 too , while @entity11 will make his loan move to @entity56 permanent provided they stay up			1
@entity257 and @entity47 be warned			2
making up the numbers at @entity3 does n't necessarily help the player or club			2
@entity50 eight players in the 25 - man squads must be homegrown			2
a player counts as homegrown if they have spent three years at an @entity7 club up to the age of 21			2
squads can be supplemented by as many under 21 players as clubs want			0
@entity20 eight of the 25 - man squad must be homegrown , four of whom must be club - trained ie have come through the ranks of the actual club they are playing for			0
squads can be supplemented by @entity279 - 21 players provided they have been with the club for at least two years			0
@entity282 from 2016 , squads will be limited to 25 players ( not counting under 21s ) , four of whom have to have grown up in @entity287 and four of whom have to be products of their club 's academy , similar to @entity20 rules			0
clubs are not allowed to sign more than two @entity296 players in a season			0
@entity298 clubs are not allowed more than three @entity296 players in their squads of 25 , or in matches			0
however , after five years , you can apply for @entity305 citizenship and become an @entity307 player , as @entity308 has done			0
there are no additional homegrown rules for @entity307 players			0
@entity312 clubs need to include eight homegrown players , including four from their own youth academy , in their squad			0
but unlike the @entity50 , squads are n't restricted to 25 players so they can still sign as many non-homegrown players as they like			0
there are no restrictions on signing @entity296 players			0
@entity3 association - trained homegrown players : @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity122 , @entity124 , @entity123			1
club - trained homegrown player : @entity121			0

@entity11 and @entity12 are two who have failed to make it at @entity3
@entity27 and @entity47 are the latest @entity7 players to be linked
@entity86 , @entity82 and @entity91 have more *success* *recruiting* @entity7
