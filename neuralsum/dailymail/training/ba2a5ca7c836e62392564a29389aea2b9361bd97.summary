by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 5 january 2013 e number which can cause hyperactivity in children is still being found in common medicines children are being exposed to banned artificial food colourings that can trigger hyperactivity – because they are still in medicines prescribed by @entity8			1
the damaging e numbers are no longer in most sweets , but the restrictions do not extend to many medicines designed for children			2
drugs which include the substances include banana - flavoured penicillin to treat infections and an antibiotic which contains a red food colouring			1
under @entity23 law , all products containing the additives must carry a health warning because of their links to hyperactivity and attention problems			2
but although they are banned in the @entity30 , @entity31 and across @entity32 , the @entity29 ’s @entity28 implemented a voluntary ban only in 2008 that asked the industry to remove the additives			1
most have complied , but many medicines still use them			1
@entity37 , from @entity38 , discovered the additives in banana - flavoured liquid penicillin prescribed to daughter @entity41 , three , to treat a throat infection			1
mrs @entity37 , 34 , said : ‘ as soon as @entity41 started taking it she was dancing around and singing silly songs			0
there was no talking to her and she was incapable of listening to instruction			0
‘ i read the packet and saw it contained the bright yellow colour @entity50			0
i phoned the @entity51 and asked for an alternative , but it contained @entity54 red colouring			0
‘ if sweet manufacturers can use natural colourings , why ca n’t the pharmaceutical industry ? a child needs to rest if they ’re ill , not effectively be drugged up twice			0
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity28 said : ‘ the agency encourages manufacturers to work towards finding alternatives to these colours			0

drugs such as banana - flavoured penicillin can contain them
@entity29 *'s* food *watchdog* only implemented voluntary ban
most complied but some still put them in medicines
