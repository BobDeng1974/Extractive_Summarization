by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 10:46 est , 17 october 2012 @entity1 suffered a terrifying ordeal after @entity4 police arrested him for posting death threats from his computer			1
the chilling postings and emails , which were traced to mr @entity1 ’s computer , threatened mass murder in @entity11 and claimed there was a bomb on a @entity15 flight to @entity16			1
but weeks after the animation director was arrested and charged , despite protesting his innocence , police realised mr @entity1 was a victim of a ‘ zombie ’ computer hacker , according to @entity21			1
threats : an unidentified hacker sent emails and postings threatening to bomb a @entity15 flight and attack the city of @entity11 from @entity1 's computer his computer had been taken over by an unidentified hacker who proceeded to send threatening emails and postings online			1
in august , just days before the threats began to appear , mr @entity1 had downloaded some free software from the internet			1
two days later , a posting appeared on a bulletin board with a threat to drive a truck into pedestrians in @entity11 and then attack them with a knife			1
tasteless : another threat said an attack would occur at the school attended by @entity44 , centre , the six - year - old grandson of @entity46 three days after the first threat was posted , a plane was forced to return to @entity49 after a threat had been emailed claiming a bomb was on board the aircraft as it travelled to @entity16			1
the police traced the threats through @entity56 ( ip ) to mr @entity1 ’s computer and promptly arrested him			1
the authorities were also investigating more threats in @entity61 , where someone had posted online that they would attack workers at video game manufacturer @entity65 and people visiting the @entity68			2
again the police traced the ip address and arrested the owner of the computer who , like mr @entity1 , protested his innocence			1
investigators discovered signs that his computer was infected with a trojan horse virus after they inspected the machine			2
further threats were made to bomb a school attended by @entity46 ’s six - year - old grandson , @entity44			1
a man in @entity83 was arrested and confessed because he believed his girlfriend had posted the message and he wanted to protect her			2
the unknown perpetrator appears to be revelling in the police ’s failure to apprehend the hacker , and yesterday a @entity4 newspaper printed extracts of a gloating email he had sent			2
the email listed the names of 12 people whose computers had been hacked , before concluding : ‘ thank you for playing with me			0
’ threats : the individual falsely claimed there was a bomb on a @entity15 flight to @entity16 , causing the plane to return to @entity49 ( file photo ) ‘ @entity108 ’ hackers take control of other computers by implanting a daemon , often by tricking the computer owner to download some software online			1
the hacker can then send commands to the infected computer from other locations			0
computer hacking has enabled a range of criminal and mischievous activity worldwide			0
as well as the postings of death threats or abusive comments , hackers have been known to steal money and people 's identities , and in other cases hackers will promote a political agenda			0
the group @entity131 , the world 's largest hacking group have taken responsibility for attacks on the @entity136 , @entity137 and threatened to destroy social networking site @entity138 in the past			2
most recently though , they named a man allegedly responsible for the suicide of 15 - year - old @entity145 girl , @entity146 , in a vigilante move			0
other hackers work while on the move and log on to people 's internet connections from outside their homes to gain access to private information or download illegal material from another ip address			0
other online fraudsters hack email accounts , and send messages asking for financial help			0
revealed : in a @entity163 video , @entity131 claimed that the man behind the bullying of @entity146 , 15 , who was found hanged , was a 32 - year - old man from @entity167 suicide : @entity169 was found hanged in her home on october 10 - just one month before her 16th birthday in one such incident in 2009 , former justice minister @entity173 was targeted by @entity176 fraudsters			0
they logged on to the mp 's email account and sent more than 200 emails asking for money , claiming mr @entity173 had lost his wallet while doing charity work in @entity184			0
briton @entity185 yesterday avoided extradition to the @entity187 after home secretary @entity188 blocked the move			0
he allegedly hacked @entity136 computers from his home in north @entity192 and has battled against extradition to face trial in the @entity187 for more than ten years			0
mrs may blocked the move on health grounds .			0
