by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:51 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 07:18 est , 15 january 2014 health experts today hit back at @entity6 's claims ' stupid ' get fat by eating ' rubbish ' , insisting obesity is not caused by bad decisions			1
the former @entity11 chairman yesterday claimed fat people have only themselves to blame for their weight if they insist on ‘ stuffing themselves silly ’			1
but the @entity15 and the @entity16 insisted obesity is a ' complex problem ' which is not going to be solved by ' lambasting and stigmatising people '			1
complex : health experts insisted that tackling weight problems was more complicated than just telling people not to eat junk food scientists say that by 2050 , half of women , almost two - thirds of men and a quarter of children will be obese			1
but earlier this week the @entity15 said these predictions were ‘ optimistic ’ and underestimated the ‘ true scale of the problem ’			1
but @entity6 was cheered in the @entity33 as he said : ‘ people ought to know that if they stuff themselves silly with high - calorie rubbish foods , they will get fat			1
‘ it ’s their responsibility and all the forums and other nonsenses are merely trying to divorce people from the consequences of their own stupid actions			2
’ health minister @entity44 appeared to agree with him			0
he said : ‘ you are absolutely right to place your finger on this central point – that it is in the end up to individuals themselves to take responsibility for their own state of health			0
’ @entity6 insisted people ought to know that if they ' stuff themselves silly ' they will get fat but the remarks were condemned by health experts			2
@entity60 , spokesman for the @entity15 , said : ' i am outraged by @entity6 ’s comments			1
claiming that obesity is caused by people stuffing their faces is nothing more than an insulting slur towards people who in many cases have serious health problems			0
' the issue of obesity is not going to be solved by lambasting and stigmatising people			0
' @entity73 , executive chairman of the @entity16 , said he was ' simply shocked ' by @entity6 ’s comments			2
' of course the public needs to be encouraged and given the information to make healthy choices , but obesity is not the product of people ’s inertia or poor decision making			0
it is a far more complex problem			1
' health secretary @entity83 last week called for ‘ some real national soul - searching ’ about how the @entity86 can ‘ grip this problem ’			2
’ the @entity87 has warned that the statistics paint ‘ an alarming picture that reveals that the obesity epidemic in @entity91 shows no signs of abating anytime soon ’			0
the @entity87 has warned that the statistics paint ‘ an alarming picture that reveals that the obesity epidemic in @entity91 shows no signs of abating anytime soon ’			0
a national obesity forum report yesterday suggested forecasts that half the @entity86 population will be obese by 2050 may ‘ underestimate ’ the problem			1
people had to stop eating ' rubbish ' and understand the consequences of their ' own stupid actions ' , @entity6 added dr @entity105 , a cardiologist at @entity106 , @entity107 , said obesity was ‘ the greatest threat to health worldwide ’			2
he said poor diet was contributing to more disease than physical inactivity , smoking and alcohol combined , and accused junk food firms of adopting strategies of ‘ denial ’ and trying to confuse the public to ensure they carried on buying unhealthy products			0
dr @entity105 said the companies were using the same tactics as those used by the tobacco industry 50 years ago when evidence first emerged that smoking caused lung cancer			0
‘ junk food companies sponsor sporting events and athletes endorse sugary drinks , with advertising that targets the most vulnerable members of society , including children , ’ he said .			0
