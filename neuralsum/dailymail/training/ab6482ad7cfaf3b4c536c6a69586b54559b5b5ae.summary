by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is likening himself to a naughty boy in the back seat of a car annoying to distraction the driver , who in this metaphorical case is @entity8			1
this is a cute analogy for their roles in the build up to the slugfest to be played out at @entity13 on saturday night to the guttural sound - track of an expectant 80,000 , the largest boxing crowd in post-war @entity16			2
it is also another amusing sample of the witty , intelligent mind games which @entity2 has been bringing to the ring ’s biggest battles of @entity16 since @entity22 and @entity23 went at it in the early nineties			1
video : @entity8 : my boxing legacy is on the line in for @entity2 rematch glove story : @entity8 with his wife @entity32 and his children as he prepares to face @entity2 at @entity13 king of the ring : @entity8 works out among his adoring fans at @entity38 's @entity37 shopping centre backseat driver : @entity2 says he will try to annoy @entity8 ' like a petulant kid in the back seat of the car ' pre-fight @entity8 , however , would argue that it is not as relevant as for their contentious first fight in november			1
‘ @entity2 irritated me then , ’ says the world super-middleweight champion			2
’ i ’m cool now			0
’ and the consensus is that a less emotional , more relaxed @entity8 has won the latest verbal punch - up with @entity2 , that eyeball to eyeball confrontation in a television studio which should help raise the pay - per - view tv sales as @entity53 as the live gate			1
five months ago it was the other way around as @entity2 got under the skin of the world super-middleweight champion			2
that time the @entity58 rose from the canvas to win with a stoppage rendered controversial by the haste with which referee @entity62 intervened			0
will it be a complete reversal of fortunes this time ? lose the slanging match , win the fight ? @entity67 says so , predicting a third round ko			1
@entity8 insists that the @entity70 who is nearly 10 years his junior missed his chance the first time			2
curiously , @entity2 was left dumb - struck in front of the @entity53 cameras when asked for examples to substantiate his allegation that @entity8 has lied about their rivalry			1
now he has found his voice again , to poke fun at @entity8 ’s hiring of a sports shrink			2
the 26 - year - old @entity2 is back to his more familiar , articulate self when he says : ‘ @entity8 has spent a lot time coaching himself not to lose his rag			1
he ’s like a father with a petulant kid in the back seat of the car			0
he has to keep turning round to tell me to behave myself			0
that ’s wearing for him			0
i ’m still getting on his nerves			0
confident mood : @entity8 says he will be ' amazed ' if he does n't knock out @entity94 at @entity13 on saturday confident : @entity8 poses in front of the crowd prior to a work - out ‘ he ’s getting help trying to control himself but it ’s not a psychologist he needs			1
’ @entity8 has turned to @entity102 ’s mind coach @entity101 to help him concentrate on fighting , not feuding			1
he says : ‘ i was guilty of letting @entity2 ’s nonsense get to me first time out			1
‘ i just wanted to flatten him			0
i needed to remind myself that it ’s called boxing , not street - fighting			0
if an expert can be of assistance with that , why not ? ‘ all the top sportsmen in the world use sports science now			0
’ @entity8 staged a bank holiday monday work - out in front of his home - town faithful in a @entity38 shopping centre			1
he appeared as calm as during the televised exchanges with @entity2 , when he told his challenger : ‘ i will be astonished if i do n’t knock you out on saturday			1
’ @entity122 shakes : @entity8 trained in front of an adoring @entity115 crowd in his home city @entity2 , who is predicting a third - round stoppage of his own , is using the title of that programme - behind the @entity129 – to argue his case			1
he says : ‘ @entity8 feels like he ’s cracked it but rope is the right word for all this			2
give @entity8 enough and he ’ll hang himself			2
’ to which @entity8 responds : ‘ i hope he really does come out rushing to beat me inside three rounds			2
that will help me stop him sooner rather than later			0
’ the animosity between the pair is rooted in @entity8 ’s perception that @entity2 does not show sufficient respect to a six - year champion going into his 12th straight world title fight against the best super-middleweights on the planet			1
@entity2 says : ‘ i respect what he ’s achieved in his career but that does n’t stop me believing i ’m better than him now			2
’ their tv debate ended with a handshake - cum - shoving match			0
best of enemies : there is a mutual dislike between @entity8 ( left ) and @entity2 but they do n't ' hate ' each other it is a rich part of boxing culture that even the fiercest of opponents embrace each other once the fight has been won and lost			1
@entity166 , for example , has forgiven @entity167 for infamously biting off a chunk of his ear and they get on well now			0
can @entity8 and @entity2 ever be friends , no matter what happens on saturday night ? first time round : @entity8 beat @entity2 after a stoppage in the ninth but it was one hell of a fight @entity8 : ‘ i do n’t hate anyone			1
but i do n’t have to like him			0
’ @entity2 : ‘ i ’ve never had a lasting problem with anyone i ’ve fought			0
we do n’t have to end up friends but i would n’t want to go through life feuding with anybody			0
’ perhaps they will just have to settle for becoming the best of enemies			0

@entity194 , of @entity209 , is the unbeaten super-flyweight champion of @entity16 and the @entity211 and so sure of his exciting ability that he is not only moving up a division but happy to take on @entity214 in his native @entity215			0
@entity195 has found redemption in boxing from a booze and drug - fuelled life in the bars of @entity221			2
duel : @entity194 ( left ) and @entity195 during the head - to - head photocall in @entity224 he reached out heroically for unexpected world championship fame when promoter @entity227 bank - rolled his successful battle with @entity229 for the vacant @entity192 title			1
@entity195 kept the title in his first defence , which ended in a technical draw when another @entity16 rival @entity234 sustained an eye - cut			1
as a 34 - year - old late - comer to prominence , @entity195 ’s determination to stay in the limelight has been fanned by the precocious 25 - year - old @entity194 ’s predictions of victory			1
@entity195 says : ‘ i ca n’t wait to shut him up			0
’ @entity242 will be televised live on @entity243 on saturday , july 7			0
