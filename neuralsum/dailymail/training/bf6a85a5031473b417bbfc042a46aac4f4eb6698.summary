the badly decomposed body of @entity6 , 62 , was found by police neatly positioned and wrapped up in bedding on july 16 last year			1
mr @entity6 , who lived in a rented two - bedroom basement flat in @entity11 , @entity12 , died nearly two months earlier from ' blunt force trauma ' to his chest , a jury was told			1
prosecutor @entity15 told @entity16 that he was murdered by @entity17 , 36 , who he met in december 2009 after advertising himself in a gay magazine as a rent boy			1
trial : @entity6 , 62 , was found dead in his seaside flat in @entity12 allegedly at the hands of @entity17 , who denies murder and grievous bodily harm opening the @entity27 's case at the start of a five - week trial , mr @entity25 said that @entity17 , who used a number of different names , moved in with mr @entity6 while he lived in @entity32 , south @entity33 , then followed him down to @entity12			1
mr @entity25 told the jury of nine women and three men : ' the prosecution say that really from the word go this defendant lived off @entity6 financially			2
' he had no job and no income , and when mr @entity6 decided to sell up in @entity32 and move to @entity12 , this defendant moved with him			2
' @entity27 's case is that this defendant and other friends of his effectively bled mr @entity6 dry financially and this defendant , while in this period , pretended to act as his carer and even godson			1
' in fact , we say he abused and assaulted mr @entity52 , resulting in a serious assault			0
' we say that he eventually killed him , and having killed him , left him to rot			1
' undiscovered : @entity6 , 63 , was found dead in his flat in @entity56 , @entity12 , pictured , two months after his death @entity17 evaded capture for nearly a year until he was arrested at a house in @entity60 , @entity61 , on may 7 under a different name , mr @entity25 added			1
in police interview , @entity17 claimed he had come home to mr @entity6 's flat to find he had committed suicide by hanging himself from a bannister , towards the end of may last year			1
mr @entity25 said : ' he said he tried and failed to revive mr @entity6 and had then panicked			2
' he said there were people in @entity71 who wanted to kill him and his family and that was why he had been unable to tell anyone about the death of mr @entity6 , and that was why he had to flee the scene and not tell anyone what happened			2
' mr @entity6 , who came from a large @entity81 family , had previously been in a long - term relationship but had been drinking heavily and suffered health problems , including osteoporosis			2
despite his numerous problems , his family did not consider him the ' suicidal type ' , mr @entity25 said			0
@entity17 , formerly of @entity88 , @entity60 , denies murder and causing grievous bodily harm but has admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body , the jury has heard			2
mr @entity6 had moved to @entity12 for a ' fresh start ' after losing his job in @entity32			2
he used part of the proceeds of the sale of his flat in @entity32 to pay a year 's rent up - front in @entity12 , jurors heard			0
@entity102 , who had lodged at mr @entity6 's @entity12 flat , was originally arrested on suspicion of his murder but later eliminated from inquiries , mr @entity25 said			1
the evidence to be produced by mr @entity102 and a third friend of @entity17 's , @entity107 , will portray a ' chaotic lifestyle and general fecklessness '			0
case : @entity17 , denies murder and causing grievous bodily harm but has admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body , @entity16 heard mr @entity25 told the jury : ' he , mr @entity102 , like the defendant , seems to have had few moral scruples about spending mr @entity6 's money			1
' he will , however , give an insight which the prosecution say will establish that the relationship between mr @entity6 and the defendant became increasingly abusive on the defendant 's part			1
' it shows an escalating pattern of violence on mr @entity6			2
' in late 2011 , early 2012 mr @entity102 , mr @entity107 and @entity17 started setting up a hairdressing salon in north @entity33 under the name ' fate ' using mr @entity6 's cash			1
mr @entity25 said : ' this money was effectively mr @entity6 's and that was being frittered away			1
this salon only traded in a brief way but it was pretty doomed to fail from the start			0
' after selling his flat in @entity32 , mr @entity6 asked one of his sisters to take control of a ' nest - egg ' for him using part of the proceeds from the sale			0
mr @entity25 said that a couple of weeks before he died , mr @entity6 contacted his sister to ask her to transfer £ 500 , which she agreed to do			0
later the same day , he telephoned her again asking for another £ 100			0
mr @entity25 said that in the background @entity17 could be heard asking her to send over more - £ 1,500			0
she again complied to his request , and never heard from her brother again			0
mr @entity25 said @entity17 used a number of different mobile phones			0
his claim to police following his arrest that he was in @entity33 during a key period proved false as telephone evidence pointed to his devices all being used in the @entity12 area , it was claimed			0
the court also heard that @entity17 sent a ' false text ' to mr @entity6 's mobile after he allegedly murdered him in an effort to shift suspicion			1
the text said : ' sweets , i 'm still at the shop , worried about @entity169 ( @entity107 )			0
will be in @entity33 for a few days			0
' mr @entity25 said : ' the prosecution 's case is that this was a false text sent to a man ( @entity17 ) knew was dead and was covering his tracks with this rather callous , anxious text , and indeed that text was never read			0
