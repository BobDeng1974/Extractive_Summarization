@entity13 released 36,000 immigrants from custody last year , many of which carried homicide or drunk driving convictions ' this would be considered the worst prison break in @entity4 history , except it was sanctioned by the president and perpetrated by our own immigration officials , ' rep. @entity39 , a @entity41 @entity40 , told reporters			1
' the administration 's actions are outrageous			0
they willfully and knowingly put the interests of criminal immigrants before the safety and security of the @entity4 people			0
' at the @entity32 , policy studies director @entity59 called the numbers evidence the administration had failed to target dangerous criminals			0
' we keep hearing from the administration that they are focused like a laser on enforcement against the worst of the worst , convicted criminals , as their top priority			0
on the other hand , they are releasing , at a rate of about 100 a day , aliens from their custody with criminal convictions , and many of them are serious criminal convictions , ' @entity69 said			1
@entity13 officials claimed many of the releases were mandated by court order @entity13 said many of the released were under electronic monitoring , had posted bond , or were required to check in with officers regularly			1
there have also been court decisions forcing release , such as a 2001 @entity91 ruling that found immigrants could not be held longer than six months if their home countries refused to take them back			2
approximately 75 per cent of convicted murderers released in 2013 were ' mandatory releases ' according to @entity13			1
' others , typically those with less serious offenses , were released as a discretionary matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding the priority of holding the individual , given @entity13 â€™s resources , and prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to public safety or national security , ' @entity13 stated			1

' in 2013 @entity13 also released thousands of immigrants , calling it the result of sequester budget cuts			1
they later clarified it was actually the regular budgeting process that led to the releases , as they had been holding more than 34,000 detainees for too long to support .			0
