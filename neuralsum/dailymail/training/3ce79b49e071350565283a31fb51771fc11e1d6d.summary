then , as he attempted to recover his way , he ended up travelling the wrong way down the spur road and the motorway itself			1
drivers swerved to avoid mr @entity1 as he hurtled towards them , with a @entity51 narrowly avoiding crashing into him			2

@entity70 , defending , told his sentencing hearing : ' the prognosis is n't clear , but if it 's the onset of @entity11 's it is n't something which quickly comes on - it 's a gradual process that may go some way to explaining what happened on this occasion			0

it must have been a frightening experience for you and the other road - users swerving to avoid you			2
' you really should have pulled into the hard shoulder and stopped instead of trying to do a u-turn			0
' you really did aggravate the situation , but i suspect that may happened because of the traumatic situation you were in			0
