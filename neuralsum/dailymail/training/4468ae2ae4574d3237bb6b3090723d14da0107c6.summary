when she was just 12 , a man in an internet chat room convinced her to flash her breasts , and a year later , he plastered a picture of the incident across @entity26			2

the group claimed that he was a 32 - year - old from @entity34			1
@entity35 chose not to name him because of legal reasons			0
but a man replying to an @entity27 email said he was not the harasser and a man at the address posted by @entity27 said he was unaware of the claims			1
local police appeared to support the man 's story saying that claims about his involvement were ' unfounded '			1
yet another man , 19 , with a similar name has an outstanding file in @entity52 , @entity53 reported , and was charged with sexual assault and sexual interference of a person under 16 in a separate case			1
outside court on monday , he told @entity59 that he did know @entity0 but that he was her friend ; the online connections between them came after he had offered his help to find her tormentor			1
