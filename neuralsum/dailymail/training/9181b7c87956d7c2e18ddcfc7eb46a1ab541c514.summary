the serious aspect of this case was of course that you were a police officer charged with public duties which are sadly are now behind you			1
' you were meeting on a regular basis with criminals that were supplying drugs			2
on december 26 you put your own addiction before your duty			2
' it is undoubtedly the case that because of the amount of contact you had with the dealers you were very close to them indeed			0
this is the shortest possible sentence when the public has been let down as badly as they have here			1
