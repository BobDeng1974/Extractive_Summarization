i got him out the way by punching him , elbowing him and kicking him			0
‘ there was another one in the doorway and so i punched him too			0
then i realised there were two more in the lounge where my daughter was			1
she was screaming in fear because she would have seen all the commotion			0
i came into the lounge and they came at me with a knife			0
