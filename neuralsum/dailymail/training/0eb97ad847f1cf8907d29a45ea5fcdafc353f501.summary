make or break time has arrived			2
in the next 13 days , @entity1 face a run of four highly - charged games which could define the club ’s season			1
for @entity7 , the spell offers a chance to turn the season round			2
no matter what has gone before , @entity1 ’s manager knows positive results against @entity13 and @entity14 in the @entity15 , and at @entity16 in the @entity17 , would bring a different hue to the campaign			1
but he is also aware that the events of tomorrow evening hold the key			2
if @entity1 beat @entity22 and qualify for the knockout stages of the @entity24 , the atmosphere around the club will be transformed			1
the pressure on @entity1 to reach the last 16 is intense			1
so how will the squad cope with the expectancy of a baying @entity42 crowd ? ‘ that ’s what we will see , ’ said @entity7			2
‘ you look forward to these games			2
our aim is to make sure we get through the qualification stage and we have a chance to do that			2
we only need one goal			2
then we have big games against @entity13 , @entity16 and @entity14			1
‘ it ( beating @entity22 ) would give you confidence			1
you could then put it ( the @entity24 ) to bed for a couple of months			1
we have to stay calm and we have shown in these last four games we have the ability to do that			2
@entity61 believes that @entity29 ( left ) still has a world - class talent that can change matches @entity1 captain @entity29 ( left ) battles with @entity65 for the ball in his side 's game against @entity28 ‘ we are harder to beat			1
hopefully we can get a little bit more luck in the final third to get the goals			0
’ that last point shows why @entity7 can not be entirely sure of what will happen			0
in corresponding games last season , @entity1 scored three unanswered goals at @entity78 , blitzed @entity14 5 - 1 at @entity42 and had a comfortable 2 - 0 win at @entity16 in the @entity80			1
the draw helped @entity1 reach a small landmark			1
it was their 1500th point of the @entity15 era			1
they are the fourth club to reach that figure ‘ we are still a little fragile , ’ @entity88 admitted			0
‘ last season we were amazing going forward and we are not at that level yet			0
but we are catching up slowly , we are becoming stronger			0
’ this , though , is a very different @entity1 team			1
circumstances mean @entity7 is trying to find another way of winning but in a charmless 0 - 0 draw with @entity28 his side only began to look a threat once @entity29 appeared from the bench			1
in the 211 minutes in which @entity29 has not been on the pitch this season , @entity1 have failed to score a single goal			1
only @entity104 , with his dancing feet and dazzling runs , looks capable of easing the burden on his captain			0
@entity88 ( right ) admits @entity1 are still a little fragile , but they are catching up slowly @entity7 ( left ) knows @entity1 have a chance to resurrect their season in the next four matches it is 10 years ago today since @entity29 dragged @entity1 into the @entity24 knockout stages with an extraordinary goal against @entity115			1
once again the responsibility will be placed on his 34 - year - old shoulders to lead the way			2
@entity7 wants to rest his captain but , as his team laboured against @entity28 , he had to turn to him in the hope of pilfering three points			0
‘ he has real quality , the kind that lifted the game , ’ said @entity7			0
‘ he has a world - class talent			0
the legs may go a bit as you get older but you never lose the talent			0
his passing and his view of the game was phenomenal			0
’ @entity28 manager @entity61 had spent time before the game showing his players videos of what impact @entity29 has on @entity1			1
the sight of a teamsheet missing the midfielder ’s name provided an unexpected bonus			0
‘ it shows how difficult it is for us ( managers ) to make decisions , ’ said @entity61 , whose side defended with diligence and deserved their share of the spoils			0
‘ it would be very easy for @entity7 to play @entity29 90 minutes every game but then lose him for a month with an injury			1
‘ when you see he is n’t playing ? phew			0
but when he came on , it was n’t just the players who were affected			0
the crowd , the atmosphere , everything changed			0
‘ that is when we suffered			0
@entity1 were coming at us from everywhere			1
he is a player who , with his presence on a pitch , makes the whole place better			0

@entity1 face @entity22 on *tuesday* with a chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the @entity24
they then face @entity13 and @entity14 in the @entity15
a @entity17 tie against @entity16 is *sandwiched* in the middle
@entity29 needs to step up and lead @entity1 through the games
