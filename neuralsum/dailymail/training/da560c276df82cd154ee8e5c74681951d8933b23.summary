for most people , a trip to the shops involves a few cars , pedestrians and perhaps a couple of stray dogs			0
but locals strolling in @entity8 and @entity9 were recently greeted by a more unusual sight - two moose			1
one of the runaway elk spent a staggering seven hours dashing through the streets of @entity13 yesterday			1
police were called and spent ' the rest of the night ' chasing the ' erratically - behaved ' animal , according to @entity8 newspaper , @entity24			1
but unfortunately , at around 10am , they decided they had no choice but to shoot and kill the moose			2
a police spokesman said : ' they had been hoping to spare the animal by directing him towards the sea so it could swim away			2
' another escapee : it comes just weeks after a drunken moose , named @entity38 , was spotted running trough @entity39 , @entity9 , after eating a pile of fermented berries			1
above , the animal eventually fell into a pond rescue : the pond 's concrete sides made it impossible for @entity38 to climb back out , but he was saved from drowning after police took to the water with a rope			1
unfortunately , his @entity8 brother was shot by police but one resident in @entity13 , which has a population of only around 600,000 , appeared less sympathetic about the animal 's demise			1
she told the paper : ' it just shows what a small rural town @entity13 is			0
i 've just told my neighbour - make sure your freezer is empty as there is so much fresh meat on offer			0
' meanwhile , the other moose , named @entity38 , was spotted on the loose in @entity39 , near @entity9 's @entity70 , last month after chomping his way through on a pile of fermented berries			1
the drunken animal was caught on camera running through the streets , before plunging into a pond in the middle of the city			1
saved : @entity39 police officer @entity80 said @entity38 had appeared ' bonkers on booze ' during the chase the pond 's concrete sides made it impossible for him to climb back out , but he was saved from drowning after police took to the water with a rope			1
@entity39 police officer @entity80 said that moose - which can reach almost 7ft tall and weigh up to 1,500lbs - tend to gravitate towards the first fruit falls at this time of year			2
apples , cherries , apricots and other assorted fruits fall from trees during storms , ferment on the ground and become an intoxicating brew for such creatures , he said			0
mr @entity102 said @entity38 had appeared ' bonkers on booze ' , adding : ' it was a magnificent specimen but he was so sozzled he could barely stand			0
' he obviously found a bunch of fermenting berries or something and really went for it			2
' we managed to rope him and get him transported to an animal shelter for the night where he slept it off			0
' vets said the moose had the mother and father of all hangovers the next day but he will soon be ok			0
' he will be tranquillised and driven out to a remote spot where it is hoped he wo n't find his way back to the big city any time soon			0
' despite @entity38 's plight , it is unlikely he will learn his lesson			0
experts calculate moose like him get ' drunk ' around 50 times in their lives .			0
