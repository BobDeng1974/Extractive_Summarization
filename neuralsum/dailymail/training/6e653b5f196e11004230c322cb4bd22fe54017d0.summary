by @entity0 published : 18:52 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 18:52 est , 16 august 2012 ministers were last night accused of plotting to introduce secret inquests by the back door			1
justice secretary @entity4 promised the idea had been abandoned after critics including the @entity7 and civil liberties groups campaigned fiercely against it			1
but mps and peers now say a clause has been quietly slipped into the @entity12 , which is going through @entity13 , allowing ministers to revive it			1
backtracking ? justice secretary @entity4 had promised that the idea of secret inquests had been abandoned alarmingly , an influential @entity17 says the decision could be taken on the orders of a cabinet minister without the need for parliamentary legislation			1
critics say the move would mean inquests into police shootings and soldiers killed by so - called ‘ friendly fire ’ could take place behind closed doors			1
@entity30 , executive director of the campaign group @entity31 , said : ‘ ministers claim secret courts will only be used for a tiny number of cases but what this development shows is that once this dangerous legislation is on the books there is a real risk it will be used by future governments to cover up embarrassing facts which they would rather the public did not hear			2
‘ secret courts are not just a threat to centuries of @entity50 legal freedoms , but also to the central principle of our democracy : that politicians must be accountable to the people that they serve			2
’ last night it emerged that ministers want to ban the public from knowing that a secret evidence session is even taking place in civil cases , such as a torture compensation hearings			1
the press would not be told that an application to hold parts of the hearing behind closed doors had been lodged by the government , preventing journalists challenging the request or even reporting it			1
campaigners likened the proposal to the ‘ super injunctions ’ obtained by adulterous celebrities			2
the controversy centres on the government ’s plan to introduce secret courts in civil cases involving national security			0
it claims they are needed to deal with compensation claims brought by terror suspects who allege they have been tortured with the complicity of our security services			0
similar cases have already led to payments of millions of pounds to former @entity91 detainees and other alleged fanatics			0
ministers say that if a case involves sensitive intelligence that could identify an agent ’s identity , or was provided by an ally who wants it to remain secret , the government should be able to present evidence in secret			0
however , in a hugely contentious move , ministers originally also proposed going even further by allowing inquests to be held behind closed doors			1
this provoked a ferocious backlash , led by the @entity7 , civil liberty campaigners and the @entity110 , which was appalled by the idea of military equipment shortages or friendly - fire deaths being hushed up			1
in may , however , mr @entity4 conceded defeat over inquests			1
writing in the @entity7 , he said : ‘ it ’s hardly a secret that i hail from the liberal wing of the @entity118			0
‘ if protecting our democratic society means riding roughshod over historic freedoms – freedom of speech , a free press , an independent judiciary and open justice – then truly we have forgotten what we are fighting for			0
’ but analysis of the remaining elements of the @entity12 reveal a clause that critics say could allow the idea to be revived			1
clause 11 ( 2 ) says the ‘ secretary of state may by order ... add or remove a court or tribunal ’ to the list of civil hearings that can be held in secret			1
having scrutinised the @entity142 , the @entity141 said this could be used to add inquests			2
the @entity145 agreed , warning that the clause meant no legislation would be needed for a future secretary of state to introduce them			2
it said : ‘ the powers are undoubtedly wide			0
they would , for instance , enable the secretary of state to specify any court or tribunal , although not in so far as it exercises a criminal jurisdiction ; and they might , in our view , be exercised so as to specify a coroner ’s court			0
’ ministers deny this is the case			0
they also insist there are no plans to break their pledge on inquests			2
but campaigners want no room for doubt that could be exploited by a future government			0
@entity170 said : ‘ i can think of nothing that would do more to undermine public confidence in the judicial system than an attempt to try to include coroners ’ courts			0
‘ there has been a promise from the lord chancellor that this will not happen			0
but i can not understand why the @entity12 still clearly indicates that there could be a power to include such a court			1
‘ the @entity142 says that in exact terms			0
the idea ... would so outrage large sections of the public , especially on publicly very sensitive cases , that i can think of little that would do more to undermine confidence			0
’ last night , @entity192 officials insisted the legislation would not cover inquests and said any change to the law would require primary legislation , adding : ‘ the @entity12 does not and could not in the future allow closed procedures to be used in inquests			1
‘ nothing currently heard in open will go into closed session , but these reforms will enable the media to report judgments in cases which currently receive no media scrutiny			2
