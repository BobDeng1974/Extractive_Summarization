the revelations will raise fresh concerns about @entity39 ’s drive to spend 0.7 per cent of @entity0 ’s income on aid			2
@entity43 mp @entity42 described the spending as a ‘ colossal waste of money ’ and warned that voters would not understand why their money was being spent to prop up corrupt regimes			1
‘ it is completely unacceptable , ’ he said			0
‘ we should not be giving money to countries who have not got their houses in order			0
' this is exactly why you hear people saying that foreign aid is taking money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries – you might as well stick a @entity67 catalogue in the envelope			2
’ figures reveal that @entity0 aid to these worst offenders rose by almost a quarter in 2013 compared to 2012 @entity72 , campaign manager at the @entity73 ’ @entity74 , said : ‘ every penny of foreign aid has to be spent on those who really need it , not to line the pockets of corrupt officials in questionable regimes			1
it ’s simply mind - boggling that we ’re dishing out aid to countries like @entity33 when our own finances are in such a terrible state			1
’ the @entity89 last night insisted it took a zero - tolerance approach to corruption			0
sources said aid programmes in countries with known corruption problems channelled money through aid agencies and charities rather than governments			2
a department spokesman said : ‘ it is precisely because the @entity0 does not tolerate corruption that we do not allocate funds to the governments of any of the 20 countries highlighted by @entity9 as being the world ’s most corrupt			1
‘ instead we use multilateral organisations like the @entity109 and trusted international non-governmental organisations to assist the very poorest			0
’ but critics warn that much of the cash still ends up in the hands of corrupt local officials			0
and they point out that the aid money funds projects that should be supported by the countries themselves			2
mr @entity42 said : ‘ even where the money is not going directly to dictators , it is still using @entity0 taxpayers ’ money to cover for the fact that they are spending the country ’s money on themselves – we are propping them up			2
‘ it is a colossal waste of money , which is being done to make lots of middle class worthy people feel better about themselves			0

although the money is channelled through charities and agencies rather than the central government to sidestep corruption , several independent reports have found that many of these groups are forced to hand over large sums of cash to the terror group @entity25 in return for protection			0
the respected @entity168 said the group had even set up an office responsible for taxing aid agencies operating in its territory			0
other countries showered with cash include @entity175 , home of @entity177 in the @entity178 , which received a 143 per cent increase , and @entity180 , where the government has all but collapsed			0
@entity33 , viewed as a pariah state by most of the world , was handed £ 1.3million			2
most of the cash is thought to have been provided by the @entity186 as part of its efforts at so - called ‘ soft diplomacy ’			0
last month it emerged the aid included funding the training of 46 spin doctors employed by the state - controlled media as propagandists			0
