by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:55 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 10:14 est , 16 april 2013 convicted rapist : @entity5 heir @entity4 will get a new sentence today after his 124 - year prison term was thrown out a @entity9 judge who threw out the 124 - year prison term of an heir to the @entity5 fortune convicted of drugging and raping three women will hear arguments tuesday on a new sentence for @entity4			1

@entity4 's lawyers @entity22 and @entity24 said in court documents filed last month that @entity4 is not a sexual predator and has had a ' stellar performance ' in prison , the @entity21 reported			1
prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum filed last week that @entity4 's sentence was appropriate , but the original court 's reasoning needed to be explained			1
' the original sentence was not erroneous – only the record needed to be corrected , ' deputy district attorney @entity34 wrote			2
it was not clear whether @entity18 would hand down the new sentence at monday 's hearing or sometime afterward			0
last month the judge refused a request to throw out @entity4 's conviction , but granted him a resentencing hearing , writing in her ruling that the court ' failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences ' as the law requires			1
@entity4 , the great - grandson of cosmetics giant @entity5 , was arrested in 2000 and charged with giving three women the drug ghb and raping them at his beachfront home while they were unconscious			1

the make - up heir ultimately sought a new sentencing hearing , and @entity18 ruled last month that the judge who sent him to prison for 124 years ' failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences ' rather than having them run concurrently			1
' the previously imposed sentence is vacated and a new sentencing hearing will be held , ' @entity18 wrote in her 28 - page opinion that also denied him a new trial			1
the judge set an april 4 sentencing hearing for @entity4			1
attorneys for the @entity5 heir had argued he deserved one , in part because his original attorneys presented weak defenses at trial and that one lawyer , @entity74 , gave him ill - conceived advice to flee to @entity59			1
bounty hunter and tv star , @entity61 told @entity99 that @entity74 gave him very useful clues as to @entity4 's location			2
reality tv star : @entity70 , pictured , caught @entity4 while he was on the run in 2003			2
last month , he revealed that he was tipped off about @entity4 's location by the fugitives own attorney as @entity99 reports , @entity74 passed away in april 2011			1
the lawyer had always refuted the idea that he had given away his client 's hiding place			1
but according to ' dog ' the attorney did give him the information , in a very subtle way			0
' @entity74 became very nice to me , ' @entity61 explained to @entity99			0
' we used to tease each other			0
and at one point he said to me , " i ’m going to tell you something @entity70 , so do n’t be so dumb			0
" and then he said , " the guy ( @entity4 ) speaks @entity122			0
do you get it ? " ' the bounty hunter immediately understood			0
' i had leads that pointed to @entity126 and @entity59 , ' he said			0
' right then i dropped all my leads on @entity126 and focused on @entity59			0
' @entity61 captured @entity4 in june 2003 and was briefly jailed himself as bounty hunting is illegal in @entity59			2
judge @entity129 ruled last month that the judge who sent @entity4 to prison for 124 years ' failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences ' rather than having them run concurrently on monday , @entity18 wrote that @entity4 's attorneys did not fail him at trial , and she rejected his current lawyers ' arguments that @entity4 was manipulated into fleeing			1
' although several witnesses did describe @entity4 as ' childlike , ' it appears that this was primarily because he did not have to work at a regular job due to the fact that he had a trust fund , and he lived the life of a carefree ' beach bum , ' @entity18 wrote			0
she added that @entity4 , who spent much of his time surfing , described himself as being involved in real estate and stock trading , and that he did not appear to have a low iq			0
