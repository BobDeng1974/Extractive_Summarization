by @entity0 a @entity2 artist has created surrealistic fantasies based on traditional fairy tales , dreams and stories using incredible props in a tiny studio			1
@entity10 ’s @entity9 , a project which she has been working on continuously since 2007 , sees her construct scenes for her camera rather than employing the traditional method of taking photos of images such as still lifes , figures , or landscapes			1
her stage for these fictional scenes , which she says convey her psychological state , is her room - sized studio in @entity24 , measuring just 360 x 410 x 240 centimetres			1
@entity25 , 30 , assumes the roles of set designer , sculptor , performer , installation artist , and photographer and she is the protagonist of each piece			1
mind blowing : @entity10 , a @entity2 artist , has created @entity9 - a project which sees her construct scenes from fairy tales and her own personal experiences in a tiny studio at times facing away from us , at other times showing only part of her body or reclining , she inhabits her dream - like realms			1
through bold materials and patterns , dramatic colours , and intriguing narratives @entity25 uses legends of @entity52 and @entity53 , @entity2 proverbs , personal childhood experiences , and her own life experience as inspiration for her work			2
among @entity25 ’s new works , which are on display at the @entity62 gallery in @entity63 , is i ’ll be back			1
this piece draws upon a @entity2 fable in which a tiger chases desperate children into a well			2
a god lowers a rope from the sky and the children escape , but when the tiger cries out , a rotten rope is lowered , condemning the tiger to a miserable fate			2
@entity25 reinterprets the horror of this inescapable situation by suggesting the possibility of survival through her own will and her art shows her lone arm reaching for a rope just out of reach while thousands of traditional blue fans conjure up the threatening waters swirling around her			1
@entity90 and bold : through bold materials and patterns and dramatic colors , @entity25 uses legends of @entity52 and @entity53 as inspiration for her work my chemical romance : this piece reflects relationships and communication through the motif of pipes that are complicatedly intertwined like a maze childhood : this piece recalls childhood memories and shows a girl who 's fast growing up from her naive childhood but does n't want to @entity108 is a nod to the @entity2 expression ' like breaking a stone with an egg ' - an ineffectual effort made in a difficult situation			1
last supper depicts the @entity117 image of @entity119 ’ last meal with the competition for limited resources illustrated by hundreds of rats racing toward a plate of cheese			0
@entity125 , which suggests the hope of rebirth , is inspired by @entity128 , a @entity2 novel from the @entity131 dynasty about a young woman who devotes herself to her blind father , and @entity135 painter @entity134 ’s @entity136 ( 1852 ) , which depicts @entity139 ’s character having drowned herself after going mad from loss of @entity142 ’s love and the death of her father			0
@entity25 identified with the tragic heroine , rising among the water lilies			0
@entity148 : inspired by @entity149 's the @entity148 , a plague of rats move toward a plate of cheese , which depicts the world where we have to compete for limited resources to survive protagonist : @entity25 is the star of her work , sometimes facing away from us , at other times showing only part of her body in her dream - like realms i 'll be back : this draws upon a @entity2 fable in which a tiger chases desperate children into a well			1
a god lowers a rope from the sky by which the children escape , but when the tiger cries out , a rotten rope is lowered , condemning the tiger to a miserable fate resurrection : inspired by the @entity182 , this is a @entity183 folktale that touches on the meaning of death and resurrection @entity188 and @entity189 are based on @entity25 's own childhood memories			0
amidst @entity188 ’s swirling patterns , objects fly off in all directions in an absurd dizziness , while @entity189 ’s grassy @entity194 , which @entity25 devoted three months to crafting , evokes a child - like wonderland			1
@entity197 , which was inspired her her personal experience last summer when her studio was flooded , evokes the perils of navigating through thousands of seductive but poisonous sea anemones			2
@entity25 ’s constructed realities belong to the directorial mode , employed since the 1980 ’s by @entity206 photographers in repudiation of the @entity209 practice that sought truth in the everyday world			0
@entity25 ’s constructed image photography has been compared to the works of @entity215 sculptor and photographer @entity217 , who builds life - sized models he intends to demolish after photographing them			1
speaking about her work , she said : ' the primary motifs in this series derive from my questions about who i am at the moment			0
' it is a photographic elucidation of my concerns about my identity , exploration about myself and search for the things that i am capable of doing , desire to do , enjoy doing and can do well , and furthermore , my thoughts on how i should live my life			0
@entity236 : this work is a collaborative piece she produced with a traditional fan - making master			2
each folding fan was carefully crafted , colored and arranged to complete the scene the @entity244 : based on @entity247 's story of the same title , this work depicts the meaning of hope as portrayed by the girl striking a match to keep her alive in the cold nightmare : the figure uses a magnet and paper clips to express the problems that are ' forever entangled in life ' , says @entity25 added touch : she adds intricate plastic creativity and theatrical performance to her art ' i try to search for the answers to my questions and concerns through the process of photographing and the subsequent artwork			2
i am neither too young nor old enough , grown up but not fully formed like the fully grown but unripe fruit , and still under metamorphosis			0
' i am an adult but can not be categorised as an adult in entirety			0
i am an incomplete being who is not entirely independent			0
the main subject in my work is to reflect myself as a member of the society and as an individual who influences and is influenced by the surroundings in it			0
' therefore , through my work , i strive to complete myself by reflecting myself and to objectify my current status and situations by creating sceneries of them			0
' my work , in essence , records my concerns and process of growing up			0
it narrates and dramatises my life stories			0
