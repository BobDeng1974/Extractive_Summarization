an illustration of a black hole : a new telescope array could allow scientists to photograph a black hole for the first time - teaming up 50 radio telescopes around the world into a global telescope that will capture the ' shadow ' of a black hole for the first time a new telescope array could allow scientists to photograph a black hole for the first time - teaming up 50 radio telescopes around the world into a global telescope that will capture the ' shadow ' of a black hole for the first time			1
scientists will meet on wednesday 18th to discuss the project , which will also test @entity20 's @entity19			1
the project - called the @entity21 - could capture the first images of the huge black hole at the centre of our own galaxy , the @entity28			1
the ' supermassive black hole ' is four million times the mass of our sun , but so far away that it appears to astronomers about the same size as a grapefruit on the moon			2
the @entity37 in the telescope 's name refers to the boundary at the edge of a black hole beyond which the laws of physics can not describe what happens			1
it is a ' @entity47 ' - from which no light or radiation can escape			0
because of it , black holes are invisible from @entity52			1
the idea of black holes was first raised by @entity20 in his @entity19 , and has been confirmed by decades of measurements and observations of space			1
but it has been impossible to directly ' see ' a black hole - the gravity that surrounds the objects is so intense that even light can not escape			1
black holes warp space and time around them			2
' nobody has ever taken a picture of a black hole , ' says @entity68 , an associate professor of astrophysics at the @entity71 's @entity70			1
' we are going to do just that			0
' ' even five years ago , such a proposal would not have seemed credible , ' said @entity75 , assistant professor at @entity76 and principal investigator on the project			0
' now we have the technological means to take a stab at it			0
' black holes are the most extreme environment you can find in the universe , ' @entity75 said			2
black holes live up to their name - they ' pull in ' light and all other energy as efficiently as they suck in matter , so no radiation reaches @entity52			1
they appear as a blank space to telescopes			0
but a ' glow ' round the outside could let scientists see the outline			0
' as dust and gas swirls around the black hole before it is drawn inside , a kind of cosmic traffic jam ensues , ' says @entity75			2
' swirling around the black hole like water circling the drain in a bathtub , the matter compresses and the resulting friction turns it into plasma heated to a billion degrees or more , causing it to ' glow ' â€“ and radiate energy that we can detect here on @entity52			2
' by imaging the glow of matter swirling around the black hole before it goes over the edge of the point of no return , scientists can see the outline of the black hole , also called its shadow			1
the team is connecting up to 50 radio telescopes scattered around the globe , including the @entity129 on @entity130			0
@entity131 in @entity71 , telescopes on @entity133 in @entity134 ( pictured ) and the @entity135 in @entity136 ' so far , we have indirect evidence that there is a black hole at the center of the @entity28 , ' @entity68 said			1
' but once we see its shadow , there will be no doubt			0
' even though the black hole suspected to sit at the center of our galaxy is a supermassive one at four million times the mass of the @entity152 , it is tiny to the eyes of astronomers			2
smaller than @entity157 's orbit around the @entity152 , yet almost 26,000 light years away , it appears about the same size as a grapefruit on the moon			0
' to see something that small and that far away , you need a very big telescope , and the biggest telescope you can make on @entity52 is to turn the whole planet into a telescope , ' says @entity167			0
the team is connecting up to 50 radio telescopes scattered around the globe , including the @entity129 on @entity130			0
@entity131 in @entity71 , telescopes on @entity133 in @entity134 and the @entity135 in @entity136			0
the global array will include several radio telescopes in @entity174 , a 10 - meter dish at the @entity176 and potentially a 15 - meter antenna atop a 15,000 - foot peak in @entity179			0
' in essence , we are making a virtual telescope with a mirror that is as big as the @entity52 , ' @entity75 said			0
' each radio telescope we use can be thought of as a small silvered portion of a large mirror			0
with enough such silvered spots , one can start to make an image			0
'' every year , we increase its capabilities by adding more telescopes , gradually sharpening the image we see of the black hole			1
'' we will be able to actually see what happens very close to the horizon of a black hole , which is the strongest gravitational field you can find in the universe , ' @entity68 said			2
' no one has ever tested @entity20 's theory of @entity19 at such strong fields			1
' @entity19 predicts that the bright outline defining the black hole 's shadow must be a perfect circle			1
according to @entity68 , whose research group specializes in @entity20 's @entity19 , this provides an important test			1
' if we find the black hole 's shadow not to be circular , it means @entity20 's @entity19 must be flawed , ' he said			1
black holes remain among the least understood phenomena in the universe			2
ranging in mass from a few times the mass of the @entity152 to billions , they appear to coalesce like drops of oil in water			0
most if not all galaxies are now believed to harbor a supermassive black hole at their center , and smaller ones are scattered throughout			0
our @entity28 is known to be home to about 25 smallish black holes ranging from 5 to 10 times the @entity152 's mass.			1

global network of 50 telescopes will capture ' shadow ' of black hole
black holes normally invisible as gravity sucks in light
crucial test for @entity20 's theory
