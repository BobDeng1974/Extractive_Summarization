as @entity1 continues his efforts to convince @entity3 he is worth another contract at @entity5 , he is safe in the knowledge @entity7 has always admired his qualities , ever since a chance first encounter			1
@entity7 signed @entity1 from non-league @entity11 , seven years ago , soon after @entity12 , @entity13 's director of football , had invited the 18 - year - old centre - half along to a trial at the club 's training ground in @entity18			1
' he was watching by chance and he pulled me into his office and it all started from there , ' said @entity1			1
' i ca n't remember the whole conversation , it 's a bit of a blur , but @entity7 was very encouraging			1
@entity1 ( centre ) in action during an @entity28 training session at @entity29 @entity1 is thankful for @entity7 and is delighted they can rekindle their relationship at @entity28 ' he mentioned in conversation that he 'd played for @entity11			1
i did n't know many other people who had played for @entity11			1
' i came back for a week to train with the reserves , and was offered a contract a month or so later			2
he 's the one who really got it started for me and it 's nice to rekindle that with @entity28			1
i hope my performances for my club help him to keep selecting me			2
' @entity7 , who played for @entity11 in the early 70s , convinced @entity1 he had a career in professional football , although the youngster decided to complete his a-levels first			1
the defender has become a key player for @entity5 this season alongside @entity49 there were university places on offer to study financial economics at @entity54 or @entity55 if he secured three bs in his exams , which he did			1
' i was planning to go to university but a month or two before my exams i was offered trials by @entity13 and @entity62 , ' said @entity1			1
' i had nothing to lose and gave it my all			0
' i 'd been at @entity66 until i was about 15			0
it was quite far to travel and i was missing some sessions , so i was n't really developing , and then i went to @entity11			1
' @entity7 signed @entity1 when he was @entity13 boss from non-league side @entity11 his education did little to impress @entity70 , earlier this season , when the @entity5 boss branded @entity1 ' stupid ' for a red card , during the first half of the derby against @entity76			1
' i was foolish , and it was a rush of blood , ' said @entity1			1
' you learn more from yourself than from what managers and fans say			0
it 's something i 've not done too often and hopefully it wo n't happen again			2
i 've learnt not to get caught up in these situations			0
i try not to clock up too many cards , but that was a moment of madness			0
' the same could be said for his decision to attend a fancy dress party last year in a @entity93 - bomber costume , with an @entity95 headscarf , shades , a flak - jacket and bottles of @entity99 and @entity100 strapped to his body			0
after being close to going to university , @entity1 is now an @entity28 international and trophy winner ' there 's always people out there that are trying to pick you up , and as a role model for young players you have to make sure you 're on the ball , ' he said			1
' that 's something you only learn as you get older			2
' it 's more a case of common sense really , but there are older players there if you do need some advice			2
it was one of those things			0
there are a lot of things that happen that sometimes get blown up			0
in general that 's rare for me			2
' niggling injuries have proved more disruptive since he left @entity13 for @entity134 in 2010 , but he is back in the team and has delivered some impressive performances as @entity70 's @entity5 started to click			1
@entity1 of @entity28 speaks to the media during the @entity28 press conference at @entity139 he was excellent in the win at @entity141 , frustrating @entity142 in the process , and was looking forward to another duel with the striker in @entity146 until he discovered @entity142 has been omitted from the squad for the friendly against @entity28			1
' if you 're doing your job and not giving the striker much of a chance he 'll probably get angry , and @entity142 is someone who can lose his temper very quickly , ' said @entity1			1
' if i 'm shutting down the striker , i 'm happy to see them get frustrated			0
' i thought it could be round two on tuesday , but i 've seen he 's not in the squad so we 'll have to wait for that			2
' the defender enjoyed winding up @entity142 and was disappointed to not see him in @entity163 's squad @entity1 's good form offered encouragement to those who believe the 25 - year - old may yet prove to be a long - term successor to @entity169			1
' i 've been able to clock up a run of games in the past few months , ' he said			0
' the manager has shown a lot of faith in me and i 've been able to stay fit			2
it ' s nice to get a good run , it helps you become more confident and to put your personality on the game			2
' @entity169 was a defender i really admired for the way he put his character and personality onto the pitch			2
he 's not just your everyday defender			1
you can see his character in the way he wants to play football			0
that 's something young players can pick up on			2
@entity169 was a major influence on @entity1 and he admired the way that he played the game ' when i joined it was a case of playing with him for a good few years and picking up a lot of points			1
eventually when he did move on i felt i was ready and it was an opportunity for me to show myself			0
' when you have the shirt , everyone else is fighting it out and trying to push you out of the way			0
when that time comes you need to make sure you 're in a good run of form so the manager feels you are the one who should step in			2
' the process has been complicated since by injuries , managerial changes at @entity134 , his own versatility and @entity70 's habit of switching between three and four at the back			0
with @entity221 qualification close to being secured , the defender can look forward to @entity222 ' i 've not had too many different managers and this is my first foreign coach , ' said @entity1			1
' he 's really worked hard on the training field right from the double sessions in pre-season			0
we 've had the tactics , and quite a lot of meetings in terms of the vision he wants			0
' he wants more from the centre - halves on the ball , rather than taking the easy option and passing to the full - back when the room is too narrow that they ca n't really do much with the ball			0
' the manager does stress why pass it to him when you 've got no - one marking you			0
i am enjoying that responsibility			0
sir @entity246 wanted us to play out , but there 's more emphasis on that now			0
@entity3 ( left ) and sir @entity246 have very different styles of management says @entity1 ' growing up , first of all you 're a defender but we have more possession than a lot of teams and we have to be a bit more like the midfield and start moves			1
' @entity1 's contract expires next year			1
as someone who had the chance to study financial economics , you might think he would be all over the details , but he is in no rush			0
' it 's not something i really want to focus on , ' he said			0
' it 's not really come into my head			0
i 'm enjoying it at @entity5			1
i 'm focusing on the rest of the season			0
i 'm happy as ever because i 'm playing and hopefully i can keep contributing			0
