however , she was given a glimmer of hope as surgeons were able to save her ovaries which tests last february revealed were still producing eggs			0
within months of her hysterectomy , ms @entity9 and her partner , @entity26 , 26 , started to research surrogacy			2
ms @entity9 told the @entity28 : ‘ our biggest worry was that even if the surrogate is pregnant with a baby that is biologically ours , legally she is the mum			1
we worried she would n’t be able to give up our baby			0
’ she explained how she was discussing the problem with her mother , when the grandmother - of - three said that she would act as a surrogate			0
she told the @entity28 : ‘ i did n’t have to think twice about it			0
i found it heart breaking that she ’d had to go through such a terrible ordeal at such a young age			0

’ however , the family has now hit another setback as their local authority has informed them that they will not pay for the @entity48 treatment required to allow @entity9 to carry @entity1 and @entity26 ’s child , because mr @entity26 already has a daughter , @entity50 , from a previous relationship			2
as a result , they now face a race against time to raise the £ 7,000 needed before mrs @entity9 reaches her 50th birthday , after which doctors will be reluctant to allow her to be a surrogate			2
