by @entity1 reporter published : 18:52 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 5 august 2013 disguise : @entity4 - @entity3 , who donned full @entity6 dress to undertake a daring mission to snatch her daughter @entity8 back from the child 's father in @entity11 a desperate mother dressed head - to - toe in @entity6 dress and hid her face behind a veil to carry out a daring mission to snatch her daughter back from the child 's @entity11 father			1
@entity4 - @entity3 , 29 , of @entity21 , @entity22 , risked everything to rescue her daughter @entity8 , three , two years after her husband spirited the girl out of @entity27 and took her to his home country			1
she ignored @entity30 warnings not to travel to the country , which is gripped by civil unrest , tracked down the child and disguised herself as a local to carry out the audacious rescue			1
her success was in large part thanks to the help of @entity39 author @entity38 , who has been nicknamed @entity40 for her efforts in helping a string of women rescue children snatched by @entity46 fathers			1
mrs @entity4 - @entity3 , who is still married to @entity8 's father , @entity47 , told the @entity48 of the dramatic moment she snatched back her daughter in the @entity52 city of @entity53			1
with the help of @entity57 - born mrs @entity55 she had tracked down the nursery where @entity8 was enrolled and the block of flats where she was living with her father 's family			2
the pair , who had enlisted a trusted driver , sat staking out the block early in the morning until @entity8 appeared with an aunt and a boy just before 9am			2
that 's when the desperate mother seized her moment			2
moving awkwardly in the unfamiliar @entity6 dress in which she had disguised her self , she got out of the car and followed them			2
' i was walking behind them , faster and faster , and saw @entity8 's hand a few metres away from me , ' she said			0
' so i grabbed her , pulled her into my arms and the lady looked at my face - but all she could see were my eyes			0
' embracing her child tightly , she turned and fled as the other woman began to scream			0
stumbling in the flowing black material of the burka , she had only seconds to bundle the astonished child into the back seat of her car - but was horrified to find the door was locked			0
' i was panicking but @entity38 managed to open it and pull @entity8 in , ' she said			1
she managed to leap in as well before the woman who she had just snatched @entity8 from caught up with them and they drove away			2
it was then that the confused toddler - who had been away for some two years - cried out for help from the woman she knew as mummy , to mrs @entity4 - @entity3 's dismay			2
' i felt shocked and upset to hear those words coming out of her mouth about another woman , ' she said			0
' but after half an hour she looked up at me and said , " are you my mum ? " ' reunited : @entity4 and @entity8 back in @entity21			0
it is just 12 days since the pair arrived back in the @entity27 after the rescue lots to catch up on : @entity8 , three , had not seen her mother for two years when she came to rescue her , and did n't recognise her , leading her to call for help from the women she had come to know as her parent the next challenge was smuggling @entity8 back out of @entity11 without alerting the country 's authorities			1
mrs @entity4 - @entity3 , who was born in @entity116 but came to @entity27 as a teenager , used the @entity116 passport belonging to her older daughter to conceal @entity8 's @entity11 surname and bribed an official to allow her to board a @entity123 - bound flight			1
the subterfuge worked , and they arrived back at @entity126 ten days ago , using @entity8 's genuine passport to re-enter the @entity27 legally			2
mrs @entity128 has since contacted her husband to tell him that she has their child			0
brushing up on her @entity133 : after @entity8 was taken @entity4 could only speak with her by phone with communication becoming increasingly difficult as the child forgot @entity133 and began speaking more and more in @entity137 together again : @entity4 with @entity8 and her eldest daughter @entity138 , six , whose passport she used to smuggle the toddler out of @entity11 without raising suspicions from border authorities in @entity143 she met @entity47 when he was running a food stall in @entity21 , shortly after splitting from her former long - term partner and father of her eldest daughter @entity138 , six			1
they moved in together and wed in september 2009 , three months before @entity8 was born , with the @entity149 converting to @entity6 , although she never practised the religion			0
@entity8 was just a year old when @entity47 whisked her off to @entity11 , giving his wife no warning of his intentions			1
he had simply told her he was taking the girl to visit friends			0
instead he had travelled straight to @entity126 , bought a ticket and boarded an @entity158 flight			0
mrs @entity4 - @entity3 still has questions about how he was able to get the @entity8 through passport control without her own passport			0
invaluable help : @entity4 with @entity38 , who has been nicknamed @entity40 for her efforts in helping a string of women rescue children snatched by @entity46 fathers over the following two years , she had on - off contact with her daughter by phone - with communication becoming increasingly difficult as the child forgot @entity133 and began speaking more and more in @entity137			1
and her husband would periodically threaten to cut off contact altogether , she said			0
police told her she could do nothing since the @entity27 has no extradition treaty with @entity11			1
it was only after a woman heard of her plight and contacted her to tip her off about @entity38 , who has helped a string of mothers reunite with children snatched by @entity184 fathers , that she was given hope			1
mrs @entity55 said : ' you only have one mother and no - one has the right to take you away from your mum			0
but @entity4 was the real hero here			0

@entity194 risked everything to rescue daughter spirited away by her @entity11 father two years ago
she was helped by @entity38 , who has helped a string of women rescue children snatched by @entity46 *ex-partners*
