he said : ' i could n't believe it when he darted straight into the sea like that			2
' he was completely unfazed by the bubbling surf and started diving up and down among the waves for ages - upwards of 10 minutes			0
he became a tiny black dot in the distance and at one point i thought he was heading to @entity44			0
' i was just wondering whether i would have to dive in myself when he started swimming in the more shallow end of the surf , so i just ran in and grabbed him			0
' he was safe and sound and in good health - in fact he did not even seem puffed out			0
far fitter than many i know			0
' the piglet , which weighed around 5lbs , swam out for 150 yards before turning round and heading back to shore as darkness was falling			1
