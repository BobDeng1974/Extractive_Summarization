@entity1 cosmonauts could be living on the @entity2 by 2030 under leaked plans drawn up by the country 's space agency			1
a draft government programme proposes a three - step plan to explore the moon that would culminate in building a permanent @entity10 - monitoring observatory			1
the document stressed the urgency of getting there before other nations , saying ' leading space powers will expand and establish their rights to convenient lunar footholds ' in the next 20 to 30 years			1
red dawn ? @entity1 cosmonauts could be living on the @entity2 by 2030 and use local resources to build @entity10 - and space - monitoring observatories , according to plans drawn up by the @entity22 and @entity1 's space agency @entity25 's plans , seen by @entity1 broadsheet @entity26 and reported in translation by the @entity29 , call for a robotic craft to be sent to the @entity2 by 2016 , with a manned mission by 2028			1
the final stage of the plan is for cosmonauts to use local resources to build an initial @entity2 base by 2030 , followed by the construction of space - and @entity10 - monitoring observatories			1
with @entity40 's sights apparently firmly set on @entity41 , despite struggling against years of funding cuts , @entity1 appears to have a relatively open field in the newest leg of the space race			2
the @entity22 has fired the starting pistol on its new space race less than three years after the @entity47 was forced to start hitching flights on @entity1 rockets			1
@entity40 ended its space shuttle programme in 2011 and has faced years of funding cuts			1
just last month a @entity53 rocket carried two @entity1 cosmonauts and a @entity47 astronaut to the @entity56 ( above ) , despite the crisis in @entity58 and tough talking on sanctions			2
@entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 have all announced their intention to launch fresh missions to the @entity2 , which was last visited by humans in 1976			1
but @entity1 's space programme , which achieved the first manned space flight in 1961 , is far ahead and is the only one to explicitly call for manned lunar missions			2
just a fortnight ago , the @entity69 announced plans for the massive new ' super-rockets ' capable of lifting payloads of up to 120 tonnes into space			0
the latest report was prepared by by the @entity75 , the @entity69 federal space agency , @entity77 and several space research institutes			0
it envisages international cooperation but stresses the ' independence of the national lunar programme must be ensured regardless of the conditions and extend of participation by foreign partners			0
' the document appears to be an expansion on plans to first set out by @entity25 last month , when deputy pm @entity89 dramatically announced : ' we are coming to the @entity2 forever			1
' the final frontier : a @entity1 @entity53 rocket takes off for the @entity56 last month			0
the @entity22 has announced plans to build a super-heavy carrier rocket that could propel its cosmonauts to the @entity2 in an article in the government 's own newspaper headlined ' @entity100 ' , he spoke of targeting @entity41 and other ' space objects ' as future priorities			1
' flights to @entity41 and asteroids in our view do not contradict exploration of the moon , but in many senses imply this process			0
' ' we are coming to the moon forever ' : @entity1 deputy pm @entity89 first outlined his country 's plans for lunar exploration and colonisation last month he wrote of ' colonisation of the moon and near - moon space '			1
in the next 50 years , manned flights are unlikely beyond ' the space between @entity122 and @entity41 '			0
but ' it is quite possible to speak about exploration of @entity41 , flights to asteroids and flights to @entity41 '			0
the essential first step as a base for research and experiments was the moon , said mr @entity89 , who is in overall charge of @entity1 's space and defence industries , and was recently targeted for sanctions over the @entity58 crisis			2
' the moon is not an intermediate point in the race , ' he wrote in official daily @entity140 , conjuring an impression of a new space race with @entity47			2
' it is a separate , even a self - contained goal			0
' it would hardly be rational to make some ten or 20 flights to the moon , and then wind it all up and fly to the @entity41 or some asteroids			0
' this process has the beginning , but has no end			0
we are coming to the moon forever			1
' @entity1 was in the @entity153 era behind many of the pioneering accomplishments in space flight , allowing them to claim an early lead in the space race			0
early achievements included the first intercontinental ballistic missile , the first satellite and the first animal in space in 1957 , the first human in space in 1961 , the first space walk in 1965 , the first unmanned moon landing in 1966 and the first space station in 1971			2
the @entity47 soon caught up and put the first man on the surface of the moon , @entity173 , in 1969 .			0

@entity22 programme proposes @entity10 - monitoring observatory on the @entity2
it calls for urgency to beat other ' leading space powers ' to the *milestone*
comes after deputy pm last month said : ' we are going to the moon forever '
