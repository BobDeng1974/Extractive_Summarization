by @entity1 reporter a high school student who suffers from multiple sclerosis has turned the condition into an advantage on the track field - because she can not feel pain in her legs			1
since @entity9 , 18 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was diagnosed with the condition three years ago , she has gone on to become one of the fastest high school runners in the country			1
the condition blocks nerve signals from her legs to her brain , meaning she can not sense pain as she maintains a fast pace - giving her a bizarre athletic advantage			1
but exercise also causes her to go numb below the waist , meaning that she must continue moving or she will lose control of her body			1
at the finish line , her coach has to get ready to catch her			1
the condition blocks nerve signals from her legs to her brain so she can not feel pain in action : exercise makes her legs numb so @entity9 must keep momentum to stop from falling over ' when i finish , it feels like there 's nothing underneath me , ' @entity38 , a senior at @entity39 , told the @entity44			1
' i start out feeling normal and then my legs gradually go numb			1
i 've trained myself to think about other things while i race , to get through			0
but when i break the motion , i ca n't control them and i fall			0
' after she falls at the finish line , her coach scoops her up and takes her to the side of the track where her teammates ice her legs until she can feel them again			1
it is a bizarre routine that has seen great success in a short time			0
when she first began running , she was one of the slowest on her team			0
but whereas a five - kilometer race used to take her 24:29 , by last november , she had completed it in 17:22			0
welcoming committee : at the end of every race , her coach and teammates catch her and carry her off pained : teammates ice @entity9 's legs until she regains feeling and can get back on her feet on her own multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system			1
@entity77 affects the brain and the nervous system and destroys myelin sheath layers between the nerves in the brain and spinal cord which stops impulses being carried around the body			2
it can cause blindness , slurred speech , muscle weakness and a loss of coordination			0
there is no known cause or cure for @entity77 , which is twice as common in women than men			0
between two and five per cent of cases are discovered in children under 16			0
it typically worsens during a ' flare ' in symptoms - what doctors call an exacerbation			0
these can last anywhere from a couple days to a couple months and quicken the disease 's progress in destroying the protective barrier around a person 's nervous system			0
it is not known what causes @entity77 environmental factors , exposure to infections and viruses and genes are all thought to play a part			0
and last month , the teenager won the @entity11 state title in the 3,200 meters			1
she completed the route in 10 minutes 43 seconds , placing her 21st in the country			1
next week , she hopes to break 17 minutes as she competes in a five - kilometer race at the national indoor track championships in @entity126			2
her coach said that he was immediately struck by her determination			2
' when she was diagnosed , she said to me , " coach , i do nâ€™t know how much time i have left , so i want to run fast - do n't hold back " , ' said @entity132			1
' that 's when i said , " wow , who are you ? " ' @entity38 was diagnosed with the condition when she could not feel her legs following soccer practice and track meets three years ago			1
her coach initially dismissed her numbness as normal but when it remained , he said he knew it was n't usual fatigue and @entity38 visited a doctor , who discovered lesions on her brain and spine			2
but following treatment , she returned to the track			2
support : her coach , @entity132 , said he had been stunned by her determination after her diagnoses no giving up : @entity9 , pictured saying a prayer before a meet , left , says she forces herself to fight on she knows that it 's only a matter of time before @entity77 - which does not have a cure - puts her in wheelchair			1
but until then , she 's not giving up			0
sometimes she has been particularly tested , such as during a state cross-country meet last year when she tripped on another runner 's foot while leading and fell to the ground			2
she was unable to get back to her legs and have to crawl to a nearby fence to help her get back on her feet - and she ran into 10th place			2
' i make myself do it , ' she said			0
' i tell myself , " i know you 're tired and you ca n't feel anything and it 's hard but you 're going to finish this			2
" and then i do			0
' while she claims that some universities never called her back after she told them she had @entity77 , @entity173 in @entity174 offered her a scholarship and she will start there this fall .			0

@entity9 was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 3 years ago and *decided* to run track while she still could
the condition blocks nerve signals from her legs to her brain , meaning she can not feel pain in her legs as she runs
but the exercise also makes her numb so her coach must get ready to catch her as she crosses the finish line
she won the @entity11 state title last month and ranks 21st in the country
