the @entity0 of @entity1 died this week at the age of 94 bringing an end to the fascinating life and times of the @entity7 sisters			1
@entity8 and her siblings moved in the same circles as @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 and epitomised a privileged and glamorous aristocratic life that no longer exists			1
the six daughters - @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 - born between 1905 and 1920 to @entity23 and his wife @entity25 , were the @entity26 of their day in terms of the public interest their antics aroused			1
from left : @entity20 , @entity34 , @entity22 , @entity19 , @entity35 , @entity17 and @entity36 they certainly gave people something to talk about with their actions and relationships , creating more scandal than that seen in the fictional @entity44			1
the most controversial of the sisters was @entity19 , known as @entity46 , who left her first husband and married the founder of the @entity50			1
they tied the knot in a civil ceremony in @entity55 ' drawing room in @entity56 in 1936			0
@entity13 was the only other guest			0
as a result , during @entity58 she was locked up as an enemy to the allies in @entity62			0
@entity63 , who has written a biography on the @entity7 sisters , said @entity19 ' became arguably the most hated woman in @entity67 for a while			1
' @entity20 , @entity17 and @entity19 in 1932 : the sisters were the @entity26 of their day as they press was hotly interested in their lives and loves but @entity19 was n't the only @entity7 with polarising political views			1
@entity21 was once an outspoken supporter of communism while @entity20 was also a fan of @entity13			1
both she and @entity19 attended the @entity78 @entity77 rally of 1933 and @entity20 was said to have become fascinated with the leader			2
they became great friends - some even believe lovers			0
when war broke out , she was in @entity84 and shot herself in the head with a silver pistol			0
she survived but was brain damaged and was sent back to @entity67 to be nursed by her family			0
she died in 1948 of meningitis			0
although many hated the sisters for their political alliances , others admired them for their wit and beauty			0
bad taste in friends : unity was a fan of the @entity100 and admired @entity13 who she regularly met up with @entity19 at the @entity102 in 1936 : her support of @entity104 led her to become ' the most hated woman in @entity106 ' they also had a brother , @entity34 , who died during @entity58 in @entity109			1
the girls were raised in stately homes in relative isolation as their father did n't believe they should go to school to be educated			1
despite this , they became prolific writers , the most successful being @entity17 who wrote entertaining stories with outlandish characters based on her own family			2
the @entity121 and @entity122 were her most popular novels and their appeal endures today			0
as a writer with an affluent background , @entity17 was a natural fit with the ' @entity129 ' - the name given to the group of young aristocrats and socialites in 1920s , including @entity14 , who raised eyebrows with their partying			2
another famous associate of the @entity7 sisters was @entity11			2
in 1937 @entity21 , then 19 , met her second cousin @entity139 , @entity11 's nephew			1
they eloped to @entity140 during the civil war causing the @entity106 government to send a war ship to the country to try and bring them home			0
blushing bride : @entity22 married @entity147 , who succeeded his father as 11th @entity1 in 1950 legacy : the @entity150 devoted her life to running the @entity154 estate they then moved to @entity156 where @entity21 remained until her death in 1996 but she had by then long lost her first husband who was killed in action during @entity58			1
@entity36 , the second eldest daughter , led the quietest life and was described as ' the most rural of the @entity32 ' as she was more content on a farm than at at cocktail parties and balls			0
the @entity0 of @entity1 also led a less scandalous life but still made her mark on history			2
she married @entity147 , who succeeded his father as 11th @entity1 in 1950 , and devoted her life to running the @entity154 estate with her husband			0
while many other stately homes have fallen into disrepair , the @entity172 house remains not only a home but a successful business as a popular tourist attraction which is testament to the @entity150 's efforts			1
the @entity150 was the last of the surviving @entity7 sisters but their legacy remains in their works of literature and at @entity154			2
in her book , ' the @entity184 : the biography of an @entity188 ' @entity63 sums up why the girls were so intriguing in their day - and remain so after their deaths			0
' these six girls , brought up in exactly the same way yet developing in such an individual manner , seem to have taken the twentieth century by the throat , ' she writes			0
' it is not so much that they were historically important - but that they were so much larger than life - easily as interesting as the characters 's in @entity17 's novels			2
