it was once a field of dreams but @entity3 ’s @entity2 is now somewhat of a nightmarish vision			2
@entity5 flew a drone of the stadium to capture haunting images of its crumbling interiors			1
only patches of turf remain on the pitch and remnants from the tumbled down roof lay scattered everywhere			0
although there 's room for more than 80,311 people and 12,000 cars , the empty parking lot has a graveyard - like feel with cracks running through the tarmac			0
the sports venue - which sits on a 127 acre plot - cost $ 55.7 million to build back in the early seventies			0
it has been closed for almost three years now and developers are yet to announce what the future plans will be			0
@entity31 shot : one of the saddest examples of the dramatic decline of @entity34 and the surrounding area is what remains of the @entity2 – the once proud home to the @entity38 , but which today is an empty shell left that 's been left to rot neglected : @entity41 bought the @entity2 in 2009 for $ 583,000 , but plans to turn it into a soccer stadium never happened disrepair : last month the final sections of the @entity2 's @entity46 - covered roof dropped to the field novel idea : @entity5 flew a drone of the stadium to capture haunting images of its crumbling interiors flashback : in its heyday the @entity2 in @entity55 , @entity3 , hosted the @entity57 , a pope , the @entity60 finals , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and dozens of other world - class acts and sporting events @entity5 , who captured the @entity2 looking in a sorry state , said : ' sad to see this stadium in this condition			1
it really needs to go now			0
' in its heyday the arena hosted the @entity57 , a pope , the @entity60 finals , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and dozens of other world - class acts and sporting events			1
almost 100,000 people would pack into the house			0
but that all changed in 2002 , when the @entity79 team moved to @entity80 in @entity34 and the @entity2 soon fell into disrepair			1
the stadium has had an uncertain fate ever since , as the city tried to find use for it - including monster truck rallies , boxing matches and as a drive - in theater - and the population in @entity55 dwindled			0
@entity41 bought the @entity2 in 2009 for $ 583,000 , but plans to turn it into a soccer stadium never materialized			2
' they had a half - a - million - dollar soccer field they bought that was put in there as well as paying for maintenance of $ 1.5 million a year up until the roof caved in , ' said @entity98 of @entity99 , who in june organized a nine day auction that raised about $ 500,000			2
turf that still featured the @entity38 ' logo from both end zones was auctioned for $ 1,600 each , while copper wiring proved very popular and raised $ 500,000			0
now , what once was one of the premier venues in the world is a tattered , empty reminder of the stadium 's memorable past - and of the dismal economy in @entity3			1
last fall @entity3 's sometimes harsh weather put pay to the final sections of the old stadium 's @entity46 - covered roof which just dropped to the field			1
