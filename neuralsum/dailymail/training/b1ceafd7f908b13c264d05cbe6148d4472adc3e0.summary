the jury in @entity16 , @entity14 convicted @entity1 , 21 , and his former @entity2 football teammate @entity17 , 21 , of gang - raping an unconscious student in a dorm room in june 2013			1
@entity9 said he wants to know if the juror lied during the selection process			1
' it would 've been useful to know this information in a case that had some of the same types of scenarios and allegations to which [ the juror ] had been a victim , ' @entity9 told @entity8 on thursday			1
he was found guilty with @entity17 ( right ) on tuesday attorney : @entity1 's lawyer @entity9 says he wants to find out if the juror lied during selection ' it 's incredible they did n't think that information was warranted			1
it could cause a mistrial , it could cost the entire case			0

on thursday , three of the jurors spoke out to that they made their decisions early on in the case after seeing cell phone footage of the attack			2
' as soon as we saw the videos and photographic evidence ... we knew exactly who was guilty of what and what we were going to come back with , ' @entity80 told @entity82			2
easy decision : jurors ( from left ) , dr @entity84 , @entity80 and dr. @entity85 said they knew they had to convict @entity1 and @entity17 when they saw sickening cell phone footage of the attack ' what we knew is that a terrible crime had occurred			1
' another juror , dr. @entity91 , said watching the footage - which showed @entity1 egging on @entity17 and two other men as the woman lay unconscious - made her feel ' awful			1
' ' i asked myself , " how could they do this to that young lady ? " ' @entity91 added			0
' there ca n't be enough explanation to me			0
i do n't know , i think they need to do some real soul searching			0
i 've never experienced anything like these young men			2
' they said the case was extremely emotional for them , and they all ' crumbled ' when they retired to the jury room , @entity91 said			2
in the trial , the victim had testified that @entity1 , whom she was dating , plied her with alcohol one night in june 2013 and the next thing she remembers is waking up in a strange dorm room			1

@entity17 then allegedly urinated on her			2
shock : @entity1 shook his head after the verdict was announced while @entity17 did not look impressed heartbroken : @entity1 's parents embrace one another after the guilty verdict was announced on tuesday ' it was n't just about sexual gratification and fun , it was about degrading her , humiliating her , ' deputy district attorney @entity144 said in his closing arguments on tuesday			1
throughout the trial , the defense had argued that the men had become swept up in a promiscuous college culture , where people walked around naked and binged on alcohol			2
' thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process			0
i 'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes			0

you are my heroes and i am so proud of and grateful for each of you			0
' i am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses			0
' finally , i want to remind other victims of sexual violence : you are not alone			0
you are not to blame			0
' but @entity144 said that was not the culture that was revealed during the trial			0
' the culture you really saw was entitled athletes thinking rules do n't apply to them , that 's the real culture you saw here , ' he told the court on tuesday			2
' their mindset that they could get away with anything			0
' the rules do n't apply to us '			0
' defense attorneys had also argued that @entity17 had consumed too much alcohol to be in control of his actions , while @entity1 had not actually penetrated the woman because he was unable to			1
but the jury 's mind was made up			0
as the verdict was announced , @entity17 sat emotionless as the jury read their verdict , while @entity1 shook his head and rolled his eyes , in compete disbelief over the jury 's decision			1
@entity1 's father could be heard crying out as the guilty charges were read against his son according to @entity222			1
