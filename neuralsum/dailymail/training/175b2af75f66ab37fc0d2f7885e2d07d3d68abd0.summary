by @entity0 for @entity1 transformation : @entity3 writes about learning to love her husband after he changed his gender @entity6 is a straight woman who married a man			1
but , over 23 years of marriage , she has convinced herself to become a lesbian - evolving her sexual preferences as her husband @entity10 became @entity11			1
when mrs @entity6 first met her husband in 1991 , he was dressed as a woman at a party			1
though he occasionally cross-dressed , he lived as a man - a successful @entity15 surgeon - the rest of his life			2
after years of marriage , however , she realized that @entity10 was yearning to do more than just wear skirts on the weekend ; he wanted to become a @entity11 - his female alter - ego full - time			0
mrs @entity6 has written a book about how her partner 's change in identity led to her changing her sexuality , as well			1
' my husband 's a woman now : a @entity29 ' was released in february			1
she detailed some of her trials in a column for the @entity34 today			2
mrs @entity6 says that she and her husband had an active sex life when they were first married			1
however , that eventually faded as @entity10 began to identify as a woman more			0
mrs @entity6 wrote in the @entity34 : ' while my comfort with fantasy enabled me to support @entity42 ’s presence in our bedroom , i sometimes longed for a scenario other than pretending we were both women during love - making			1

it ’s time to talk to an endocrinologist			0
' mrs @entity6 ( left ) says she has learned to be satisfied with her supportive partner @entity11 after she underwent a sex change following 20 years of marriage at first the transition was difficult for mrs @entity6			1

' there was no denying i was a “ hopeless heterosexual , ” as my lesbian sister once teased me			2
the sexual side of our relationship faded ; i was losing my lover , ' she wrote			0
but she says she leaned on the tender emotional connection that she and her partner maintained throughout their relationship to keep the relationship together			0
and now , three years after @entity10 came out as @entity11 full - time , she says she had found new satisfaction in her marriage to a woman - and her new own new sexual identity as a lesbian			2
' we connect through deep discussions , mutual discovery and respect , caring and generosity			0
we focus on non-sexual ways of expressing love — cuddling , gentle caresses , holding hands			0
these interactions became more critical to our relationship than frequent sexual expression , ' she writes .			0
