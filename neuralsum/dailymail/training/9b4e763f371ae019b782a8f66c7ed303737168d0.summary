by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 07:58 est , 19 april 2013 barred : the popular black cat plays with staff at the @entity4 sorting office , but bosses want the animal out a stray cat adopted by posties is to be evicted because @entity10 bosses believe it breaches health and safety guidelines to have an animal on the premises			1
the black @entity15 has visited @entity17 's sorting office every day for the past five years , putting a smile on the faces of staff - just like @entity21 and his beloved companion @entity22			2
he has been adopted by 100 staff but is facing a workplace ban after managers ruled he was a risk , adding it was not ' ideal ' having a cat around @entity10 staff have fed and cared for him since 2008 and say the feline , who they just call ' cat ' , has become part of the team			1
almost 1,000 people have joined a @entity38 group called ' @entity39 ' in less than a week , and inspired on @entity40 , with # savethestratfordcat trending			1
a postman who has worked there for 13 years , who wanted to remain anonymous ' because we could probably lose our jobs for this ' , said : ' we ca n't see the reason why he has to go because he does n't harm anyone			0
it is a pointless exercise , why are they trying to do it ? ' another worker , who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals , said : ' the area manager came in and said " the cat has to go for health and safety reasons "			1
' we are all angry and upset			0
it is health and safety gone mad			1
the cat does not do anything wrong			2
everyone has a bond with the cat			2
he is part of the team and the furniture , he has done five years service			0
he gets lots of fuss and cuddles and has even got its own ball and stash of food '			1
friend : the cat , known as ' cat ' , is shown here on the sorting office 's steps , but he is about to be rehoused a third staff member added : ' he has been there longer than most of the managers so how can they possibly demand its eviction ? he does not get in anyone 's way or cause problems , it just sits around			2
he 's here when we open up at 3.30am and he 's usually the last to leave at night			0
' we are in uproar			0
@entity101 posted on the @entity38 page : ' save the cat , he was with me through my interview in the chair beside me , please save the cat : ) ' @entity109 , who works at the sorting office , said : ' @entity21 has a cat on delivery			2
together , we will save this poor b * * * * *			0
look how cute he is ! : ) ' @entity115 , another postal worker , said : ' save our cat ! if it makes a difference ill get the tipex out so he 's white too and call him @entity22 ! ' ( sic ) relaxed : the popular cat has visited every day for the past five years , and eats and sleeps on the premises as the postal workers love him @entity126 said : ' it 's never @entity21 without @entity22 ' , while @entity128 posted : # come on fellas , we can do this , beat the royal mail nd save the cat ' ( sic )			1
@entity10 confirmed they were looking for a sanctuary that would take in ' cat ' and a transport cage appeared at the depot earlier this week			1
a @entity10 spokesman said : ' although this stray cat has become a regular visitor to the good natured postmen and women in our sorting office , we will be speaking to a local animal welfare charity to find a suitable permanent loving home for the stray			1
' sad : despite a campaign by staff and local people , bosses are said to have brought this cat transporter in , ready to move the stray cat on home : the cat wanders in freely but @entity10 want it stopped and the cat moved on as soon as possible but the employees think the owner lives nearby the depot and say it would be wrong for @entity10 to re-home the helpless puss			1
' we gave him a collar but it was taken off			0
we tried to find a home for him but he has never wanted to go home , ' another said			0
local people have condemned @entity10 with many saying ' shame on them ' over the red - tape madness			2
@entity170 said : ' what a shame that @entity174 / @entity173 are getting rid of this cat			0
do n't they know he could keep vermin down			0
also its beneficial too workers so they work better and more @entity180 are they going too do with him if he cant be found a home			0

@entity184 visits @entity4 posties every day for food and cuddles
but @entity10 bosses want him out on health and safety grounds
more than 1,000 join campaign to keep the animal , called simply ' cat '
