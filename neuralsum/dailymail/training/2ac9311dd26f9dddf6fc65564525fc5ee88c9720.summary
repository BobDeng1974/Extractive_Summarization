the image features a desolate stretch of road littered with rubbish and lined with ghost - like yellow cabs , perhaps shells left to rust when the inevitable zombie apocalypse struck the city			0
the buildings look rundown and there are no people to speak of			0

the @entity2 app has been copping flack ever since it was introduced in 2012			1
at @entity29 , @entity28 critiqued the app less than 24 hours after it was introduced : ' like so many things in life , @entity2 's horrific new @entity2 app would be funny if it were n't so sad			2
but after @entity2 decided to ditch @entity36 for its own troubled offering in @entity38 , users have been left with bad directions , incorrect business listings , and a missing @entity41 , ' he wrote			2
tidal wave : the @entity36 @entity44 in @entity45 ( right ) , and the @entity2 ( left ) version , which would have you believe it has turned sideways , and also that it 's integrated with @entity47 - which it has n't been since 1959 other criticisms include showing the wrong location of the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , marking an entire city as a hospital , wrongly classifying a nursery as an airport , placing the city of @entity58 in @entity59 inside the city of @entity61 , and identifying the nearest gas station to be as far as 76 miles away from the user 's location another potentially disastrous error in the app sent @entity52 looking for the town of @entity68 into the middle of a national park with no water supply , 43 miles from the town			1
some people required rescuing , forcing @entity52 police to issue a warning against using the app. take flight : if you were looking for @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity2 ( left ) would have you find it on the runway of the city 's airport , while @entity36 ( right ) takes you safely to your destination @entity2 was top of the list of @entity89 's @entity88 ' fails ' of 2012 in december 2012			1
heads at @entity2 acknowledged the problems with the app and the company has been working on fixing the issues , but it seems there are still some serious problems with its 3d imaging			0
' @entity2 made $ 9.5 billion just in @entity98 of 2013 alone , and 11 of those dollars went into further development of @entity2 , ' opined an @entity22 user in the comments section of @entity4 's zombie street .			1

an @entity2 image shows a @entity4 street that looks like it 's been *infested* by zombies and left a ruin
@entity2 users have been *lambasting* the app since it was *launched* in 2012
the app was named one of @entity89 's top 10 ' fails ' of 2012
