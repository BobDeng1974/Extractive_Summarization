astronomers believe there are at least two unknown planets waiting to be discovered well beyond @entity3			2
they claim these planets are changing the position of objects away from @entity7 , causing them to behave in strange ways			1
if their theory proves true , scientists say it could ' revolutionise ' solar system models			1
scientists say at least two planets could exist in our solar system beyond @entity3 ( artist 's impression pictured ) astronomers have spent decades debating whether hidden @entity3 planet remains to be discovered within the solar system			1
scientists at the @entity22 and the @entity23 say there must be at least two planets to explain the orbital behaviour of extreme trans - neptunian objects			2
these objects , known as @entity28 , describe minor worlds such as @entity3 that orbit the sun at a greater average distance than @entity7			2
the most accepted theory says that the orbits of these objects , which travel beyond @entity7 , should be distributed randomly			1
they should also fulfil a series of characteristics such as have an inclination of almost 0 ° and an or angle of perihelion – which is their closest point of the orbit to our sun - close to 0 ° or 180 °			0
last year two researchers from the @entity47 discovered a dwarf planet called 2012 @entity49 in the @entity51 cloud , just beyond our solar system			1
each one of these images was taken about two hours apart a trans - neptunian object is any minor planet in the solar system that orbits the sun at a greater distance on average than @entity7			1
the largest known trans - neptunian objects are @entity3 and @entity62			0
these are followed by @entity64 and @entity65 yet what is observed in a dozen of these bodies is quite different : the average inclination of their orbit is around 20 ° and angle of perihelion – 31 °			0
' this excess of objects with unexpected orbital parameters makes us believe that some invisible forces are altering the distribution of the orbital elements of the @entity81 , ' said @entity82 , a scientist at the @entity22 and co-author of the study			0
a trans - neptunian object is any minor planet in the solar system that orbits the sun at a greater distance on average than @entity7			1
@entity3 was the first trans - neptunian object to be discovered in 1930			0
then , more than 60 years later , astronomers found a second trans - neptunian object , ( 15760 ) 1992 @entity94			0
since then however , over 1,000 trans - neptunian objects have been discovered			0
the largest known trans - neptunian objects are @entity3 and @entity62			0
these are followed by @entity64 and @entity65			0
' we consider that the most probable explanation is that other unknown planets exist beyond @entity7 and @entity3			2
' ' the exact number is uncertain , given that the data that we have is limited , but our calculations suggest that there are at least two planets , and probably more , within the confines of our solar system , ' adds the astrophysicist			1
their theory goes against the predictions of current models on the formation of the solar system , which state that there are no other planets moving in circular orbits beyond @entity7			1
but , the recent discovery by the @entity120 radio telescope of a planet - forming disk more than 100 astronomical units from the star @entity124 , suggests that planets can form several hundred astronomical units away from the centre of the system			2
last year two researchers from the @entity47 discovered a dwarf planet called 2012 @entity49 in the @entity51 cloud , just beyond our solar system			1
they believe that its orbit is influenced by the possible presence of a dark and icy @entity136 , up to ten times larger than our planet			0
the recent discovery by the @entity120 radio telescope of a planet - forming disk more than 100 astronomical units from the star @entity124 , suggests that planets can form several hundred astronomical units away from the centre of the system .			0

astronomers noticed objects beyond @entity7 were behaving strangely
they believe behaviour can be explained by presence of dwarf planets
if their theory proves true , it could ' revolutionise ' solar system models
