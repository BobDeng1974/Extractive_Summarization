for @entity0 to pick up four @entity2 points despite not playing particularly well in their first two games of the season is a positive			2
but surely @entity6 has seen by now that if @entity0 are to achieve the standard of modern big clubs – @entity9 and @entity2 success – per @entity11 just is n’t up to it			1
just look at what happened in @entity14 in the summer			0
indeed , their game with @entity31 was an epic largely because of the @entity33 ’ atrocious defending			0
@entity11 was subsequently dropped and @entity26 kept a clean sheet against @entity35 , going on to win the tournament			1
fair play to @entity38 for showing @entity11 the respect his 100 + caps warrants by putting him on for the final few minutes of the final at the @entity42			1
the truth might hurt , but @entity11 ’s flaws are obvious			1
and @entity0 fans saw him struggle again at @entity20 on saturday			0
if he were @entity47 , he would be getting absolutely hammered by everyone right now			1
mertesacker has had a great career , with lots of international caps , but it must hurt that after several near - misses – semi finals and a final – @entity26 only crossed the line and won a major tournament after he was eventually dropped			1
i ’m afraid it looks like a pattern @entity6 will have to copy , if he ’s got the guts to do it			0
mertesacker has won over the fans at the @entity65 over by berating team - mates who he feels are n’t doing their best for @entity0			2
remember him scolding @entity69 and jabbing his finger towards his fellow @entity33 ’s face for not applauding the travelling @entity73 fans after the 6 - 3 defeat last season			0
fans love that sort of thing , but observers can see through the chest - beating , badge - kissing exhibitionism for what it is			0
maybe @entity69 should have been at the front of an orderly queue to berate @entity84 on saturday after @entity86 ’s goal			0
what do @entity0 want to achieve ? they do n’t want to just win the @entity88 – they want to win the title after 10 years in the @entity2 wilderness , and they want to win the @entity9			0
they ca n’t do that with @entity11 at the back			1
it ’s a tough thing to say about a guy who seems like a decent guy , and probably plays to the best of his ability			0
but can the @entity73 afford to carry him on their journey back to the top of the @entity47 game while they explore unchartered territory for @entity103 in @entity104 ? losing the battle : @entity86 gets the better of @entity11 at @entity20 glory : @entity11 was part of the @entity26 squad that won the @entity27 in @entity14 truth hurts , but truth is @entity11 is n’t good enough for what @entity0 want to achieve			1
@entity6 can do the classy thing and follow @entity38 ’s lead – keep sticking the big flopping @entity33 on the bench week in week out , or stick him in the @entity0 costume to give him time on the pitch at the @entity65			2
but as a first choice centre half at a top @entity2 club , he ’s doing a great job of making @entity121 look like @entity122			1
like our dedicated @entity123 here			0
new role : @entity0 might want to put @entity11 in the @entity0 costume to give him time on the pitch			2

per @entity11 is not at the standard a big club needs
if he was @entity47 he *'d* have been hammered for his display against @entity134
@entity26 won the @entity27 once @entity11 was dropped
he *'s* making @entity121 look like @entity122
