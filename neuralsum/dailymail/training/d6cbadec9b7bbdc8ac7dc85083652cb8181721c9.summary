by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:08 est , 9 december 2013 people in their 40s are the most likely to be admitted to hospital after abusing drink or drugs , a new report has revealed			1
more than half a million people were admitted to hospital as an emergency in the last three years with health problems related to drink or drug use , health performance experts @entity9 said			1
of the 533,302 admitted since 2010 , more than 120,000 were in their 40s			1
people in their 40s are the most likely to be admitted to hospital after abusing drink or drugs of those , 60,738 were 40 to 44 , the @entity17 said , while 60,083 were between 45 and 49			1
almost one in five people in their 40s admitted to hospital in 2012/13 were classed by the @entity20 as ‘ emergency admissions due to a known drug / alcohol issue ’ , the report said			1
the news comes just days after the @entity24 revealed that official figures showed alcohol - related hospital admissions among those aged 45 and over have more than doubled in the last ten years			1
the figures also revealed alcohol - related hospital admissions among those in their 60s have almost tripled			1
in contrast , the increase was much lower among younger adults			0
the data shows that in 2012/13 , a total of 26,209 men and 12,461 women aged 45 to 49 ended up in hospital due to alcohol			1
more than half a million people were admitted to hospital as an emergency in the last three years with health problems related to drink or drug use this was the highest total for any five - year age group			1
but the statistics reveal that the greatest increase in hospital treatment for alcohol problems over the past decade was among those in their 60s			2
during that period there was a 178 per cent rise in admissions of men aged 65 to 69 and a 177 per cent increase in admissions for women aged 60 to 64			0
admissions more than doubled for every age group over 45			0
experts said this was the cumulative effect of life - long drinking by the baby - boomer generation who felt liberated from societal constraints in the 1960s and 1970s			0
almost one in five people in their 40s admitted to hospital in 2012/13 were classed by the @entity20 as ' emergency admissions due to a known drug / alcohol issue ' but they added that many older people are drinking too much now			1
in contrast , the smallest rises among adults in the past ten years were seen among those in their 30s – perhaps because this is the age at which many people settle down and have children			0
commenting on the latest figures , experts warned of a generation that is gambling with its long - term health through heavy drinking and drug taking			2
@entity90 , co-founder of @entity9 , told the @entity91 the figures suggested there was a particular issue among people born in the 1960s			0
he said : ‘ the bulk of the problem is in this age group			0
it seems they are the ones that have used drinks and drugs more than previous generations and it is now catching up with them in middle age			0
’ the data , collated for dr @entity9 ’s annual @entity108 , which is released today , also revealed that alcohol and drug abuse problems cost the @entity20 £ 607million a year			1
while drinking problems were spread across all socio - economic groups , the poorest were most likely to end up in hospital			0
some 192,014 – 36 per cent - of the total admissions since 2010 were of people in the most deprived income group , compared with 45,957 - 8.6 per cent - of people in the wealthiest 20 per cent			1
the figures also showed an alarming number of children and teenagers were admitted to hospital for drink and drug problems			1
more than 1,000 children between the ages of 10 and 14 were hospitalised each year - 3,013 over the three year period - and 24,101 teenagers between 15 and 19 years old			0
some 15 per cent of drink or drug - related admissions were among those aged 30 to 34 , 18 per cent between 35 and 39 , and 16 per cent for 50 to 54 - year - olds			1
more than 1,000 children between the ages of 10 and 14 were hospitalised each year - 3,013 over the three year period - as were 24,101 teenagers between 15 and 19 years old and the figures uncovered a geographical divide in the numbers of patients admitted because of drink or drugs , with higher rates in the north of @entity140 , the @entity17 said			2
@entity141 , chief operating officer of the @entity142 , which represents hospitals , said the hidden problem of middle - age drinking to excess was more harmful than binge - drinking			0
he told the newspaper : ‘ it ’s all too easy to dupe ourselves that binge - drinking teenagers or stag and hen parties in their 20s are the cause of alcohol - related pressures on the health service			1
‘ today ’s news puts this myth firmly back in its place and makes it even more important that as a society we seriously examine the impact our drinking habits have on our health - and on our health service			0
’ the @entity166 warned that the burden from alcohol on the @entity20 was unsustainable the @entity166 warned that the burden from alcohol on the @entity20 was unsustainable			2
a spokesman said : ‘ it is vital that we take more action to tackle the impact of excessive alcohol consumption on the @entity178 ’s population and the @entity20			2
‘ as the @entity9 research highlights , this is a problem that affects large numbers of people across all age groups and as a result places serious strain on a number of already overstretched @entity20 services			2
a @entity190 spokeswoman said : ‘ these figures highlight the very real harm that alcohol and illicit drugs can have on users of all ages , and the need for action not just to raise awareness and prevent substance abuse , but also to ensure that the right services are accessed by the people that need them			0
‘ we are helping the @entity20 target harmful drinkers with measures such as increasing the use of interventions by health professionals , and introducing alcohol liaison nurses in @entity211			2
‘ however there must also be more focus on prevention , not just treatment for those with existing problems			0
‘ we are also working to both reduce harmful drug and alcohol use and to increase the numbers recovering from their dependence			0
our focus is on combining health and social policies to help people affected access services , rebuild their lives and play a full part in society			0
