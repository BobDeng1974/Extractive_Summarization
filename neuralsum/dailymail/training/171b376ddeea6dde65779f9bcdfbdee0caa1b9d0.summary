by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 11 september 2013 a couple whose son was born without a diaphragm are reeling after doctors revealed their unborn second child will have the same severe condition - a one in 50,000 chance			1
@entity9 and @entity10 's son @entity8 , now three , was born with a severe case of @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
the condition usually causes a hole to develop in the baby ’s diaphragm - but @entity8 was born with no diaphragm at all and had to have a new one made out of sports clothes fabric			1
@entity9 and @entity10 have been told that their unborn child has the same diaphragm abnormality that their son @entity8 , three , suffers from			1
the condition is not thought to be genetic the family , from @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , were shocked when doctors diagnosed their unborn second child with the same condition - just 20 weeks into the pregnancy			1
‘ it was like a bomb that hit us			0
neither of us could speak , ’ said mrs @entity10			2
‘ i had to be peeled off the examination table by @entity9			0
’ @entity8 has been undergoing treatment at the @entity39 in @entity27 under the care of paediatric surgeon dr @entity41			1
she said : ‘ in my 30 years of working with @entity12 patients , i have never seen a family with two children with this same condition			1
’ at present , no - one knows what causes @entity12 , which kills more than half of its sufferers			2
@entity50 was born without a diaphragm because he has a severe case of @entity12			1
the condition normally causes children to be born with a hole in their diaphragm the couple learned during mrs @entity10 's 20 week scan that their second child has the same condition			1
they say they were so shocked that they could not speak patients must undergo surgery that closes the hole by either stitching together the muscle or using @entity69 fabric , which is used in waterproof clothing			0
but as a result , they suffer with pulmonary hypertension – high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs - and underdeveloped lungs , meaning they find it difficult to breathe independently			0
there is no suggestion @entity12 is genetic , which makes the @entity10 's diagnosis all the more shocking			1
@entity8 's surgeon , @entity41 , said : ' in my 30 years of working with @entity12 patients , i have never seen a family with two children with this same condition ' @entity8 had a diaphragm created out of @entity69 - a material that is usually used for making sports clothing mrs @entity10 spoke about when the baby was diagnosed			1
she said : ' it was like a bomb that hit us			0
neither of us could speak			0
i had to be peeled off the examination table by @entity9			0
we were hysterical ' they had already undergone five years of fertility treatments in an attempt to avoid passing on a gene that mrs @entity10 carries for neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes tumours to grow along the nerves			2
the fertility treatments did not work and they conceived @entity50 naturally - but the neurofibromatosis gene was not passed on			0
today , @entity8 has all the appearance of a healthy child , but the family live in constant fear that his diaphragm could rupture or that he could twist his intestine			1
mr @entity111 said : ‘ when you see how well @entity50 is doing now you ca n't imagine how touch - and - go it was at one time , how sick he was			2
mr and mrs @entity10 say they live in fear of @entity8 's diaphragm rupturing			1
they say that he is now just like any other child other than for his scar before @entity8 ( pictured in hospital as a baby ) was conceived naturally , his parents had five years of failed fertility treatments in an attempt to produce a child without a genetic condition that mrs @entity10 carries			1
luckily , he does not have it mr and mrs @entity10 say they will approach their new baby 's illness with the same optimism that helped them cope with @entity8 's			1
image shows an ultrasound scan of the baby ‘ if you see him , apart from his scar , you would n't think that there was ever anything wrong with him			0
’ the couple are determined to raise awareness of the condition , which affects as many children as cystic fibrosis			2
so much so , that they have donated two of their frozen embryos to @entity12 research in the hope of finding the cause of the condition			2
and while they find themselves facing the same heart - breaking fight again , they have vowed to face it with the same optimism and vigour that has given @entity8 a second chance at life			1
@entity12 is a hole in the diaphragm that allows organs from the abdomen to move into the chest			2
this prevents the normal development of the lungs meaning the baby will struggle to breathe when it is born			0
in severe cases , no diaphragm is present at all			0
@entity12 affects about one in every 2,500 babies			0
it is often diagnosed during a routine pregnancy ultrasound - otherwise it will be picked up when the baby is born and struggles to breathe			2
the outlook for babies with @entity12 is increasingly positive with new surgical techniques being developed			0
it is not known what causes @entity12			0
it can lead to complications including chronic lung disease , failure to thrive and developmental delays			0
babies with the condition require surgery to repair the hole and return the organs to the abdominal cavity .			0

@entity111 has @entity12
he was born with no diaphragm and had to have surgery to create one
at mother @entity10 's 20 - week scan during her second pregnancy , the couple learned their second child also has the condition
@entity8 's surgeon said she 's never seen a family have two children with @entity12
couple have vowed to face *situation* with same optimism they did with @entity8
