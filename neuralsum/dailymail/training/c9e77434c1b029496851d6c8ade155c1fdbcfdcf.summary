by @entity0 published : 19:08 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 7 march 2013 @entity1 will warn hospital bosses about the dangers of simply aiming for ' not coming last ' too many middle - of - the - road hospitals are ' hitting targets but missing the point ' , the health secretary is to warn			1
@entity1 will say that hospitals which simply meet minimum standards should tackle ' mediocrity and low expectations before they turn into failure and tragedy '			1
during a speech at the @entity16 ’s health policy conference in @entity17 , @entity18 , mr @entity1 will warn hospital bosses about the dangers of simply aiming for ' not coming last '			1
average hospitals which meet national targets but are not doing anything to improve their services are ' not good enough ' , he will add			1
he is expected to say : ' imagine for a moment that the main objective for our @entity27 athletes was not to win but to ‘ not come last ’			1
how many gold medals would we have won then ? ' it sounds ridiculous , does n’t it ? but today i want to suggest that too much of the @entity33 is focused on doing just that			2
' not on achieving world - class levels of excellence - the gold medals of healthcare - but meeting minimum standards , the equivalent of ‘ not coming last			1
not straight away , but over time as complacency sets in , organisations look inwards , standards drop and then , suddenly , something gives			1
' the lesson of @entity46 is surely that we need to understand why they fail in the first place - which means tackling mediocrity and low expectations before they turn into failure and tragedy			2
' he is expected to add : ' there are plenty of other hospitals where their staff friends and family scores are about the same today as they were in 2009			1
they ’re hitting their targets , they ’re not failing but , on the basis of this indicator anyway , they ’re standing still			0
' hospitals must not be allowed to cruise along , hitting the targets but missing the point			1
“ because ‘ not bad ’ is not good enough			2
not if we want the @entity33 to be the best in the world			0
not if we want everyone to have access to the best healthcare			0
not if we are to meet the challenges of increasing expectation alongside increasing age			0
' harsh lessons : mr @entity1 will add that the @entity33 must learn from the failings at @entity46 he said that one hospital significantly improved standards by listening to patient feedback and introducing a ' new culture of patient - centred ambition '			1
' in the 2010 national patient survey , @entity86 scored in the bottom 20 per cent on more than half the questions asked , ' he will say			0
' they were not in a good place and they knew it			2
so they introduced the friends and family test			0
they now ask every patient , very simply , how likely they are to recommend @entity98 to their friends or family and to name one thing they could do to improve their stay			2
' from tv remote controls , to warmer rooms to staff shortages , patient feedback led to fast corrective action , including focusing more resources in wards that were under pressure			0
' a year ago , their own patient satisfaction scores averaged 65 per cent			0
today , they ’re up to 75 per cent			0
' in that same period , @entity117 infections are down 80 per cent , pressure ulcers are down 30 per cent and falls down 20 per cent			0
not all of this is because of patient feedback , but it is thanks to a new culture of patient - centred ambition - as @entity125 , the chief executive says : " it ’s changed the nature of the discussion "			0

@entity1 will say that hospitals should not simply aim for bare minimum
expected to tell hospital bosses ' not coming last ' is *n't* good enough
and that ' *coasting* can kill as complacency sets in and standards drop '
