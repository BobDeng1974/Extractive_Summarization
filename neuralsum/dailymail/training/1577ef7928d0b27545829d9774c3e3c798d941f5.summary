@entity6 currently has paying subscribers in 11 cities			1
backed by billionaire @entity56 , has plans to more than double that total			0
broadcasters including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 have sued @entity6 for copyright infringement , saying @entity6 should pay for redistributing the programming the same way cable and satellite systems do			1

' @entity6 is in some ways novel , but it is also among a host of technologies that uses the @entity91 to offer consumers the ability to do what they always have more cheaply and conveniently , ' the @entity104 and @entity105 said in a supporting legal brief filed in the @entity1			2
but the broadcasters and their backers argue that @entity6 's competitive advantage lies not in its product , but in avoiding paying for it			1
' @entity6 is simply a blatant free rider trying to make a quick buck without paying anything toward the true costs of what it misappropriates , ' @entity118 said in a court filing			1

" the federal appeals court in @entity7 ruled that @entity6 did not violate the copyrights of broadcasters with its service , but a similar service has been blocked by judges in @entity140 and @entity141 the 2nd @entity13 @entity142 said its ruling stemmed from a 2008 decision in which it held that @entity145 could offer a remote digital video recording service without paying additional licensing fees to broadcasters because each playback transmission was made to a single subscriber using a single unique copy produced by that subscriber			1

the @entity191 administration , artists , actors , @entity188 and the @entity189 all support the broadcasters			0
