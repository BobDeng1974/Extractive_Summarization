@entity0 today continued to pile pressure on @entity2 to extend tax cuts for the middle class , saying a rates hike would be like getting a ' lump of coal ' for @entity8			1
in the first of a series of campaign - style speeches designed to sell his solution for the ' fiscal cliff ' , the president argued that @entity16 should extend existing bush - era tax rates for households earning $ 250,000 or less , while allowing increases to kick in for the wealthy			1
however , @entity16 leader @entity20 described the state of negotiations as a ' stalemate ' and criticised @entity0 for not making a serious offer on a deal			2
he urged the public to pressure their local members of @entity2 to pass the middle - class tax cut extension as quickly as possible			1
pointing out that every @entity45 family will face a tax hike on january 1 if no deal is reached , @entity0 said : ' i 'm assuming that does n't sound too good to you			1
that 's sort of like the lump of coal you get for @entity8			1
' he insisted he was ready to sign a deal straightaway , joking , ' there are no shortage of pens in the @entity61 and i carry one around for an emergency , just in case			2
' speaking out : the president said a middle - class tax hike would be like a ' lump of coal ' for @entity8 the president was clearly in a comic mood as he quipped that he was ' keeping my own naughty and nice list ' to determine which members of @entity2 would get sets of @entity29 , the toy which is made at the factory in @entity78 where he was speaking			1
he also took a dig at @entity80 , who was pictured shopping at @entity81 on thursday , saying : ' he wanted to buy some of this stuff , but i told him he had too much work to do			2
i was n't going to have him building roller coasters all day long			2
' also on thursday , an effort made on behalf of democrats thursday to avert the looming fiscal cliff turned out to be fruitless			2
the @entity61 made an offer to @entity89 that aides familiar with the talks panned as ‘ a joke ’ , ‘ an insult ’ and ‘ a complete break from reality , ’ according to @entity96			0
one @entity16 aide familiar with the offer that treasury secretary @entity99 and @entity61 congressional liason @entity100 presented to @entity20 confirmed the @entity102 leaders said their proposed $ 4trillion package would raise $ 1.6trillion in tax revenue up front			1
@entity61 @entity16 called that number too high and too extreme to be offering this late in the game with only a month left before the deadline			0
joking : @entity0 was clearly in a comic mood despite the seriousness of the upcoming ' fiscal cliff ' @entity36 said they would give in on $ 400billion in spending cuts from entitlement programs like @entity114 in exchange for the added tax revenue			1
@entity20 slammed that number right after the meeting at a press conference though he would not say what the number should be			0
‘ no substantive progress has been made between the @entity61 and the @entity123 , in the two weeks since @entity0 welcomed congressional leaders at the @entity61 , ' @entity20 said			0
@entity36 swiftly countered that any holdup was the fault of republicans who refuse to accept @entity0 ’s campaign - long call to raise tax rates on upper incomes			1
at the @entity61 , presidential press secretary @entity132 said , ‘ there can be no deal without rates on top earners going up			0
’ taking a confrontational , at times sarcastic tone , he said , ‘ this should not be news to anyone on @entity141			0
it is certainly not news to anyone in @entity45 who was not in a coma during the campaign season			0
’ making a list : @entity0 promised to give @entity29 to members of @entity2 who co-operate with the @entity61 with barely a month remaining until a year - end deadline , the hardening of positions seemed more likely to mark a transition into hard bargaining rather than signal an end to efforts to achieve a compromise on the first post-election challenge of divided government			1
@entity20 suggested as much when one reporter asked if his comments meant he was breaking off talks with the @entity61 and congressional @entity36			0
‘ no , no , no. stop , ’ he quickly answered			0
‘ i ’ve got to tell you , i ’m disappointed in where we are , and disappointed in what ’s happened over the last couple weeks			0
but going over the fiscal cliff is serious business			0
’ @entity16 aides provided the first description of the @entity61 ’s offer , although @entity36 officials readily confirmed the outlines			0
under the proposal , the @entity61 is seeking passage by year ’s end of tax increases totaling $ 1.6 trillion over a decade , including the rate hikes sought by @entity0			1
in addition to seeking tax increases totaling $ 1.6trillion over a decade , @entity0 also asked for approval by year ’s end of $ 30billion to renew expiring jobless benefits , $ 25billion to prevent a looming january 1 cut in fees for doctors who treat @entity114 patients and an undisclosed amount to help homeowners hit by the collapse in real estate values			1
counterattack : @entity20 claimed that the @entity36 had not yet offered a credible deficit deal the @entity61 also wants a new stimulus package to aid the economy , with a price tag for the first year of $ 50billion , as well as an extension of the @entity198 payroll tax cut that is due to end on december 31 , or some way to offset the impact of its expiration			1
in political terms , the @entity61 proposal is a near mirror image of what officials have said @entity16 earlier laid down as their first offer — a permanent extension of income tax cuts at all levels , an increase in the age of @entity114 eligibility and steps to curtail future growth in @entity198 cost - of - living increases			1
in exchange , the @entity16 has offered to support unspecified increases in revenue as part of tax reform legislation to be written in 2013			1
the @entity16 said the @entity61 was offering unspecified spending cuts this year			2
those would be followed next year by legislation producing savings from @entity114 and other benefit programs of up to $ 400billion over a decade , a companion to an overhaul of the tax code			2
for the first time since the november 6 elections , partisan bickering seems to trump productive bargaining as the two sides maneuvered for position			0
ready to make an offer : @entity99 sat down for talks with congressional leaders on thursday at issue is a bipartisan desire to prevent the wholesale expiration of bush - era tax cuts and the simultaneous implementation of across - the - board spending cuts			1
the potential spending reductions , to be divided between military and domestic programs , were locked into place more than a year ago in hopes the threat would have forced a compromise on a deficit reduction deal before now			0
economists in and out of government warn that sending the economy over the ‘ cliff ” would trigger a recession			0
to avoid the danger , @entity0 and @entity2 are hoping to devise a plan that can reduce future deficits by as much as $ 4trillion in a decade , cancel the tax increases and automatic spending cuts and expand the government ’s ability to borrow beyond the current limit of $ 16.4trillion			1
in the first few days after the elections , @entity20 said he was willing to accept a deal that included new revenues , a long - time @entity36 demand , and @entity0 has said he will sign on to savings from @entity114 , @entity270 and other benefit programs that @entity36 have long defended from proposed @entity16 cuts			2
at the same time , both sides have worked to tilt the bargaining table to their advantage			0
as part of that effort , @entity0 travels to @entity278 on friday to campaign for his tax proposal			2
@entity20 , who will begin a second term as @entity61 speaker early next month , has appealed to his rank and file to remain united			0
at a closed - door meeting this week , he displayed polling data that showed the public would rather see loopholes closed than rates raised as a means of raising revenue for the government			0
at the same time , there are tremors within the @entity16 ranks , with a small number of republicans saying they are willing to let tax rates rise at upper incomes in view of the election returns , and others predicting legislation to that effect would pass the @entity61 if put to a vote .			1
