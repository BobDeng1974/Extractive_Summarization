by @entity0 published : 16:53 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 08:40 est , 26 april 2013 they are less than a month old but the @entity3 quads are already getting used to beating the odds			1
first their parents @entity5 and @entity6 went through four rounds of @entity10 – and all their savings – to conceive them			1
then they survived being born by emergency caesarean more than 11 weeks prematurely , with each weighing just over 2lb , after their mother developed complications in the pregnancy			1
hello little brother : @entity3 , left , was the first of the quads born , followed by his identical twin @entity20			1
both weighed 2lb 4oz when nurses revealed they were expecting quadruplets , sales director mr @entity3 , 43 , and his wife were overjoyed and stunned and to cap it all , @entity3 , @entity20 , @entity25 and @entity26 are two sets of identical twins – a one in 70million occurrence			1
mr and mrs @entity31 married in 2007 and when their attempts to conceive naturally were unsuccessful , they decided to try @entity10 treatment			1
the first three rounds failed but finally last year , after spending a total of £ 40,000 , 36 - year - old mrs @entity31 fell pregnant at the fourth attempt			1
until the 12 - week scan , the couple , from @entity39 , @entity40 , believed they were having only one baby			1
when nurses revealed they were expecting quadruplets , sales director mr @entity3 , 43 , and his wife were overjoyed – and stunned			1
‘ i just could n’t believe it			2
it was like it was a dream , ’ said mrs @entity31 , a foreign exchange team leader at @entity47			2
‘ i was over the moon , so happy , but at the same time it did n’t feel like it was happening to me			2
’ @entity5 and @entity31 welcomed @entity26 , the twin sister of @entity25 , who weighed 2lb 4oz @entity25 was the heaviest of the quads , weighing 2lb 6oz after she and her siblings were born prematurely son : @entity3 was the first of the four babies to be born , weighing just 2lb 4oz next ! @entity20 , 2lb 4oz , then followed his slightly older , and identical brother @entity3 into the world but specialists at @entity62 in @entity63 put a dampener on their happiness by pointing out some stark realities about the difficulty of carrying quads			1
mrs @entity31 said : ‘ they gave us three options : get rid of all of them , get rid of two of them or keep them			2
there was no way we could get rid of them			2
we were happy to let nature take its course			2
’ then during a routine check - up last month , doctors found that mrs @entity31 , who had not been due to give birth until june 13 , had pre-eclampsia – a dangerous high blood pressure complication – and a low blood platelet count			2
on march 30 doctors performed an emergency caesarean			2
‘ there were no guarantees but they said they hoped they would all survive and be okay , ’ said mrs @entity31 , who was 29 weeks into her pregnancy			1
@entity3 was first , weighing 2lb 4oz followed by his identical twin @entity20 , 2lb 4oz , @entity25 , 2lb 6oz and @entity26 , 2lb 4oz			1
proud dad : smiling father @entity5 and mum @entity6 hold the two sets of identical twins in the hospital room where they are caring for their children hard work : look after the pairs of identical twins is , as you can imagine , taking the family some time already mr @entity3 , who watched the births , said : ‘ it was slightly like an out of body experience , being there and watching it was unreal			0
‘ i was largely excited but very concerned about whether everything was going to be okay			0
it was great that they were out and crying but there was a little way to go			0
’ mrs @entity31 said : ‘ what was hard for me was that i could n’t see the babies until the day after			0
i heard each one crying as they came out and then they got whisked away and checked over and taken to the special care baby unit			0
’ relief : the survival of @entity6 's four babies defied the odds by living after being born nearly three months early doing well : after being cared for by staff at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity20 and his sibling are growing stronger all the time complications : boys @entity3 and @entity20 had breathing difficulties but soon recovered and the twins were all home within weeks on the second night after they were born , both the boys developed difficulties breathing but quickly recovered			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ after about day five or day six we began to feel a bit more optimistic			0
’ the couple expect to be able to take their quads home from the special baby unit at the @entity120 in @entity121 within weeks			1
mr @entity3 , one of triplets himself , said : ‘ we are ecstatic , words ca n’t describe the feeling			0
it ’s all good news			0
they are doing well and getting bigger and stronger which is the main thing			0
eventually we will get them home			0
’ they are confident of coping with the demands of mass late - night feeds and nappy changes			0
‘ my mum and dad have sold their house and moved in with us to help us out , ’ said mrs @entity31			0
the couple plan to buy a much bigger car and say shopping has been bewildering			0
‘ i suppose it starts to hit home when you go into @entity159 , ’ mr @entity3 said			0
‘ when you tell the staff you ’re having four , they just look at you blankly			0
