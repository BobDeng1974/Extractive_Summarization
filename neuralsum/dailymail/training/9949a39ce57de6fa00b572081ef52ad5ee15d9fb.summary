by @entity0 a mother has hit out at the @entity2 for funding ' boob jobs for fame - hungry glamour models ' while refusing to pay for surgery to help her disabled son walk			1
@entity7 , 23 , was astounded when she was told hospitals did not ' routinely fund ' the type of surgery that could radically transform the life of her son @entity12			1
the wheelchair - bound five - year - old has a type of cerebral palsy called spastic diplegia			1
she was astounded to be told hospitals did not ' routinely fund ' the type of surgery that could help @entity12 walk unfair : ms @entity7 lambasted the @entity2 for funding ' boob jobs for fame hungry glamour models like @entity29 ' , but not her son 's surgery			1
earlier this year , @entity33 barman @entity32 was branded @entity35 ’s vainest man when he revealed he had a state - funded £ 5,000 nose job this causes muscle stiffness , meaning he can not walk more than a few steps unaided			1
there is no cure for the condition but an operation called selective dorsal rhizotomy ( @entity45 ) could improve @entity12 ’s walking			1
the procedure would release tension in his legs , allowing him to undergo more intensive physiotherapy to let him walk unaided – so he can try to fulfill his dream of playing football			2
but @entity55 will not fund @entity45 because the treatment is not considered to offer ' value for money or clinical effectiveness ' compared to other procedures			1
it was removed from a list of publicly - funded operations in april 2013 after a consultation			2
mrs @entity7 is now launching a £ 25,000 fundraising drive to pay for her son 's surgery privately			1
speaking about fury , she said : ' they will fund things like boob jobs on the @entity2 , but they wo n’t carry out surgery like this on all children who desperately need it			1
' it ’s disgusting that there are people who actually need operations and they ca n’t have them because the government ca n’t fund it			1
' but the @entity2 will pay for boob jobs for fame hungry glamour models like @entity29 who just wants to be a celebrity and use the operation to make thousands of pounds for herself			1
' @entity12 ’s life would be changed by the surgery but instead they are paying for people who want to copy tv stars to have nose jobs			1
' struggle : @entity12 , pictured here aged one , can crawl , but can not sit up properly or walk unaided as his condition causes muscle stiffness			1
there is no cure , but the procedure would release tension in his legs upset : @entity12 ( pictured left at nine months ) is frustrated at not being able to do what other children can @entity12 lives with his mother , father @entity105 , 25 and four - year - old brother @entity106 , in @entity107 , @entity108			1
he was diagnosed with @entity109 when he was 18 - months - old and has been undergoing regular physiotherapy ever since			2
@entity12 currently gets around with the help of a wheelchair or walking frames			2
but his parents claim he could be able to walk unaided if he had the life - changing surgery			1
ms @entity7 , his full - time carer , said : ' by cutting out the bad nerves , the good ones would be left intact , and his muscles would loosen			1
' @entity12 ’s legs would be easier to move and he would be able to walk			1
he would have a much happier and easier life			0
@entity123 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			0
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			0
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			0
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			0
' at the moment he is frustrated at not being able to do what other children can do			0
' he can stand against furniture but can not walk unaided			2
he bunny hops , or crawls , but ca n’t sit up properly			0
' he goes to a mainstream school and they are very good , adapting things like sports days so he can take part			0
but it is very hard for him when he ca n’t keep up			0
' @entity29 sparked fury when she had her breasts enlarged from a @entity170 to @entity171 on the @entity2 in 2009 - costing the taxpayer £ 4,800			1
and last month the mother - of - two defended her decision to sell four tickets to the birth of her next child			2
the part - time model has sold two for £ 5,000 and two for £ 10,000 , which include permission to film and take photographs			1
and she infuriated taxpayers earlier this year when she tweeted a snap of herself earlier with the caption : ' sticks and stones may break my bones , but tax payers will always fund me			2
' earlier this year , @entity33 barman @entity32 was branded @entity35 ’s vainest man when he revealed he had a state - funded £ 5,000 nose job			1
the 22 - year - old underwent the operation on the @entity2 in may in a bid to emulate his hero @entity196 and become the ' perfect man '			1
an @entity2 spokesman said : ' the @entity2 does not routinely fund @entity45 for the condition because , although it is a promising treatment , current evidence on its effectiveness in such cases is limited			1
' @entity45 surgery shows real promise for some patients with mobility problems and that ’s why we want to explore it further through our innovative evaluation programme			0
' ms @entity212 has raised £ 500 since launching her campaign a month ago and has several fundraising plans lined up to try and reach her £ 25,000 target			1
she said : ' it is going really well so far			0
we have about £ 500 at the moment			0
' @entity12 ’s dad @entity105 and a couple of his mates are cycling to @entity222			1
it should be about 125 miles			0
we 'll keep fundraising from there			0
' to donate to @entity12 ’s fund , visit www.gofundme.com/b26gso @entity29 from @entity227 , had a boob job on the @entity2 to boost her confidence the number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £ 52.5million			1
many of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment , but the increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses			0
in one case , @entity29 had an enlargement after saying her @entity170 chest was ruining her life			2
the former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it emerged she had a £ 4,800 state - funded boob job at the same @entity248 that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two - year - old to walk			1
she later claimed her breasts , which were boosted from a @entity170 to a @entity252 , were ' so big ' she found them embarrassing , and called on the @entity2 to pay for a reduction			2
and barman @entity32 , 22 , of @entity256 , in the @entity108 , was given a nose job by the @entity2 – and boasted how easy it was to get the £ 5,000 procedure			1
he now says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery , including another nose job , as well as having his ears pinned back and jaw reshaped			0
the obesity epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill , with the number of liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in ten years			0
the cost in the most recent year will have been up to £ 9.6million , according to @entity271 which says the operation costs between £ 1,500 and £ 5,000			2
there has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £ 19.9million			0
this operation is supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision			0
and 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £ 34.1million			0
@entity281 , of the @entity282 ’ @entity280 , said : ‘ it ’s ludicrous the @entity2 pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs			2
’ the figures were compiled by the @entity287 , following a request from the @entity289			0
it also showed that up to £ 20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations , £ 5.8million on tummy tucks and £ 5.7million on ear pinning			0
however , these totals have declined over the past decade			0
last month health secretary @entity295 told a @entity297 lunch : ‘ we should not be doing cosmetic work on the @entity2			2
’ @entity300 , of pressure group @entity301 , said : ‘ there are two types of cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort where someone is just trying to look better			0
' we agree with the secretary of state that this kind of thing is no longer affordable on the @entity2			2
in fact , it is amazing it was ever considered affordable at all			0

@entity7 's five - year - old son , @entity12 , has a type of cerebral palsy
causes muscle stiffness , so can not walk more than a few steps unaided
ms @entity7 amazed to be told @entity2 did not fund op that loosens muscles
is furious that others , like aspiring model @entity29 , get funding
said : ' it ’s disgusting that children who desperately need funding ca *n't* get it '
@entity2 *bosses* say treatment is not considered to offer ' value for money '
mother is now fundraising to raise £ 25,000 for the op to be done privately
