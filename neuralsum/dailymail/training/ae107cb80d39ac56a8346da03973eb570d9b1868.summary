by @entity0 published : 12:17 est , 1 july 2013 updated : 01:33 est , 2 july 2013 the trend for taking ' selfies ' - photos of yourself - has taken photo - sharing site @entity5 by storm - and now the phenomenon has been given a makeover thanks to a concept camera with two halves			1
the duo camera , designed by an engineering student from @entity14 , has two sides joined together by magnets			1
a couple , or group of people , can separate the two halves and take photos simultaneously of each other or themselves			1
the two shots are then joined together in a single image , making sure no - one in the group is left out			1
the @entity31 device lets couples or groups take photos simultaneously to make sure the photo taker is included in the shot when one shutter on one half of the duo camera is pressed , both cameras take a picture			1
the two shots are put together , into a single photo , separated by a line down the middle , pictured there are two buttons on each of the two halves , which are joined together by a pair of magnets			1
one button controls the shutter			2
the other turns the dual camera mode on or off			2
with the mode enabled , when one shutter presses , both cameras take a picture			2
the two shots are put together into a single photo , separated by a line down the middle			2
the camera is the brainchild of student @entity63 , who is currently studying engineering at the @entity65 in @entity14			0
he wanted to develop a system that meant the person taking the photograph was not excluded from group shots			0
beginning with two large boxes fitted with lenses , triggers and shutters , @entity63 developed his prototype into a handheld device			0
each camera half has a synchronised trigger which means that the photographers do n't have to press the button together - one person can control both cameras			1
when one trigger is pressed , both halves capture whatever is in front of the respective lens			1
the two shots are then put together into a single photo separated by a line down the middle			0
the camera can also be switched to single camera mode and used like a traditional camera			1
the @entity31 prototype began as two large boxes fitted with cameras and triggers			1
@entity63 developed the camera so it was easier to hold in one hand and presented the concept camera as his final project at the @entity65 's @entity103 program @entity63 's blog said : ' put yourself in the photos you take			1
an engaging and inclusive photo - taking experience			0
' when browsing through old photos , we have stronger memory connection and emotion projection while seeing photos with ourselves inside			0
' however , documenting the presence of self is not an easy task and there is usually one person has to be excluded from photos taken in social events			0
' duo is a separable camera with synchronised triggers to captures the moment			0
the two halves of the duo camera are joined together by magnets			1
there are then two buttons on each of the two halves			0
one button controls the shutter			0
the other turns the dual camera mode on or off			0
in single camera mode the duo can be used like a traditional camera ' it invites people to engage the photo - taking process ; by being both photographer and subject at the same time , it enables people to have fun documenting and being documented			2
' inspired by the fact that many people feel uncomfortable being photographed or do not like seeing their self - images , this project explored the meaningful impact of self - image and ways of encouraging people to enjoy taking photos			2
' @entity63 calls it a ' binary camera ' and he developed the camera as part of his final project at @entity65 's @entity103 program			0
there are no plans to release the camera commercially .			0

the two halves of the @entity31 concept camera are connected by magnets
each half has a lens and shutter and can be used to take individual photos
the two pictures then create a single image with everyone included
