could this be anything to do with the @entity3 ' jingly song @entity4 , where the island 's name is sung in the chorus			1
you know how it goes : ' @entity0 , @entity10 , ooh i wan na take ya ... ' as it was , we would be hearing this tune many times on this fascinating @entity18 island			1
@entity0 is a @entity20 protectorate			2
once part of a group of three islands that fell under @entity20 rule ( @entity26 and @entity27 are the others ) , it has been independent since 1986			2
from the moment you touch down at @entity31 , you sense there something special is going on			2
home for the week : enjoying the sunset at the @entity37 & @entity38 beach resort in @entity0 yes , it has white - sand beaches and clear , blue waters packed to the brim with every fish you could hope to see and of course the bars ooze rum punch			1
but there 's also the grandeur of the architecture in the capital , @entity51			1
the @entity37 & @entity52 is a low - lying hotel on the quiet @entity53 , on the western coast			1
our room was simple , though luxurious , all dark - wood furniture and linens			1
it overlooked a pretty garden , the lawns stretching out to the beach half a minute 's walk away			2
the capital city of @entity51 is home to many grand @entity20 - style buildings in a myriad of beautiful colours on our first day , we headed inland to explore some rock formations thought to have healing powers			1
my wife @entity72 swore she felt a tingle , touching the rocks			2
then we adjourned for lunch with local fishermen at the @entity78 , a cafe perched above the landing stage for their boats			0
we decided next day that we would take a snorkelling tour boat to get a close look at a wreck			0
tickled pink : flamingos are easy to spot on @entity86 in @entity0 it was something neither @entity72 nor i had ever done before and we set off in a packed boat for the site , which was about a third of a mile from the shore			0
we spied some elegant flamingos on the way			0
the wreck loomed out of the gloom 20 ft below us and suddenly we were confronted by thousands of colourful fish flitting here and there			0
' they were so close			0
i felt like a fish , ' said @entity72			0
one day we decided to make a late - afternoon visit to @entity51 's historical museum			1
beautifully laid out in the cool of one of the town 's oldest buildings , and packed full of everything from the antiquities made by the island 's native people to clever , interactive installations			1
beach life : most holidaymakers park themselves on the fabulous white sand beaches our guide , a young history buff , told us gripping tales about the traders , pirates , invaders and other colourful characters			0
he , and the whole island , is especially proud of one inhabitant , @entity126 , who fought with the @entity20 in @entity127 , one of the few black soldiers			2
he died a hero , executed by the @entity130			0
this connection to @entity133 history was brought home to us later , touring a nearby park , where there is a lovely statue of @entity138			0
colonial colour : @entity51 blends @entity141 and @entity20 influences with a myriad of colourful buildings colourful iguanas stroll protectively around her feet , and we thought how right it was to see her in such a beautiful place , under the @entity0 sun. we had arrived in @entity0 feeling like foreigners ; we left feeling very much that we had known the place for years			1
