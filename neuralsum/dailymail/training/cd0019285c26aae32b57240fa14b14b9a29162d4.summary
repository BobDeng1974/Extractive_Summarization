once , her very presence struck fear into everyone from fellow world leaders to those ‘ @entity6 wets ’ she brutally purged from her @entity7			1
her political heyday may be long gone , but the same gravitas was instantly recognisable in @entity10 during a rare public outing last week to enjoy the spring sunshine in a @entity14 park			1
accompanied by @entity16 , her ever - faithful carer of the past ten years , the 86 - year - old former prime minister sat contentedly watching a group of boys playing football			1
she was in remarkably good spirits , happy to chat with admirers who stopped to speak to her as she relaxed on a park bench			1
to the evident delight of @entity10 , a young hound which had been sprinting around the park jumped up on to the bench			1
she did n’t hesitate to stroke the dog affectionately			1
contented lady : @entity10 was immaculately dressed and in good spirits during a visit to a @entity14 park as ever , @entity10 was dressed immaculately , this time in her favourite long green overcoat with a lemon yellow scarf and mitten gloves			1
her make - up was flawless			1
a hairdresser , who visits at least once a week , ensures those distinctive blonde tresses — though whiter than they once were — are never out of place			1
but it was the comfortable sandals , rather than elegant heels and padded shoulders — the signature of her days in @entity48 — which betrayed her advancing years and unsteadiness on her feet			1
a walking stick perched at the end of the bench was another indication			1
but , in typically @entity60 fashion — refusing to accept any sign of weakness ( particularly in others ) , she often stubbornly refuses to use the stick			1
still fiercely proud , the woman who used to survive on four hours ’ sleep a night makes few allowances for her own physical frailties			2
firm friends : @entity10 seemed to delight in the company of a dog that bounded over to her @entity10 — who was @entity70 ’s longest - serving prime minister in more than a century and , of course , the first and so far only woman to conquer the summit of @entity70 political life — has suffered a series of strokes in recent years , which triggered the onset of dementia			1
her mental frailty was the theme of the controversial recent film , @entity81 , which focused on her twilight years			2
( neither she nor her son and daughter , sir @entity84 and @entity85 , have seen the movie			2
) nowadays , @entity10 spends most of her time in her elegant four - storey home in @entity88 with @entity16 , a trained private nurse , who works full - time with the former pm			2
@entity16 also lives in , serving as @entity10 ’s cook , her dresser and , most importantly , devoted friend and companion			2
another carer , a @entity96 - born nurse called @entity97 , has also been employed in the past six months to share the responsibilities			2
and the police protection officers are never far away			2
aside from the odd visit to the park , there are also occasional lunches at @entity10 ’s favourite @entity104 , also in @entity88 , where @entity16 and her family stayed the night before the royal wedding			1
only two weeks ago , she was there with @entity109 , who was her personal private secretary for almost 20 years			2
but , most days , she is simply content to sit at home in her favourite armchair in the drawing room , listening to classical music			2
she skims the newspapers , watches the news on television — although her favourite television programme is @entity118 — and reads selected mail			2
hundreds of letters pour into her @entity122 office each week , and she still signs books and photographs for well - wishers			0
a small but steady stream of visitors forms the devoted and highly protective inner - circle			0
@entity129 , known as ‘ @entity130 ’ , who was @entity10 ’s dresser , confidante and travelling companion in @entity48 , comes to stay in @entity14 for a week at a time			1
sir @entity134 , the curmudgeonly @entity96 who was her @entity48 press secretary , is another regular visitor , along with @entity136			0
her husband @entity137 , the former cabinet minister , was badly injured in the @entity139 bomb which killed his first wife , @entity140 , at the @entity141 in @entity142 1984			1
@entity136 had been his secretary at the time of the terrorist attack			0
dame @entity145 , a former boss at @entity147 , and @entity148 , the mp for @entity149 , are also regulars			0
sadly , there are infrequent appearances from her children , as @entity84 lives in @entity154 and @entity85 in @entity155			0
sir @entity84 ’s two children , @entity157 , 22 , and @entity158 , 18 , from his first marriage to @entity161 - born @entity160 — whom he divorced in 2005 — are only occasional visitors , since they both live in @entity163			0
after a long day in @entity48 , @entity10 used to kick off her shoes in the flat upstairs and unwind with a stiff whisky			0
these days , it is a weak gin and tonic before dinner			0
because her short - term memory is poor , she is now most comfortable in small groups of friends			0
she avoids events with large crowds , and will be absent when the @entity175 attends a ceremony in @entity177 tomorrow to mark her @entity178			0
lady and the scamp : the dog entertains the former prime minister , her helper @entity16 ( centre ) and a woman park - goer formidable : former prime minister @entity10 in her heyday ( left ) and ( right ) the years are beginning to take their toll on @entity81 a force to be reckoned with : @entity10 with @entity190 ... but these days she is simply content to sit at home in her favourite armchair in the drawing room , listening to classical music ‘ @entity10 will watch it on the television at home , ’ says a friend			1
‘ she is still very interested in what ’s going on			0
and she still has very strong views — as you can imagine			0
’ there have also been a clutch of invitations to mark the 30th anniversary of victory in the @entity206 next month — one of the defining moments of her premiership			0
but she has declined them all			0
her friends insist that she is comfortable and content			0
as one says : ‘ there are flashes of the old @entity10 , when you have to have your wits about you			0
and whenever you go round , she is always immaculately dressed as if she ’s off to a night at the opera			0
but it ’s a quiet life these days , and early to bed			0
’ looking at her sitting on the park bench , however , there is one thing that is conspicuous by its absence : her famous handbag			1
as prime minister , she once declared women ‘ are generally better at wielding the handbag than the bayonet ’			1
now , though , it seems @entity70 ’s greatest - ever woman politician no longer has need to wield either .			0
