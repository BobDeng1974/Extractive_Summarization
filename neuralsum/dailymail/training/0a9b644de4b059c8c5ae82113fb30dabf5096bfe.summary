by @entity0 published : 10:20 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 10:23 est , 7 march 2014 dark matter is beginning to live up to its name			1
the mysterious force could be what killed off the dinosaurs , according to a new study that attempts to explain presence			0
the research argues that comets are not created by the sun ’s influence over space rocks , but instead pushed towards our planet by dark matter			2
researchers at @entity18 argue that comets are not created by the sun 's influence over space rocks , but instead pushed towards our planet by dark matter dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact			2
scientists are fairly sure it exists , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			0
astronomers have only been able to theorise its existence through the gravitational effects it has on matter in the universe			0
dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact			2
scientists are fairly sure it exists , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			2
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
the @entity64 says : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			0
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			0
' similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly			0

@entity83 and @entity84 at the university in @entity86 claim that as the solar system orbits the centre of the @entity90 , it moves up and down in a 70 million year cycle			1
their calculations suggest the solar system would move through a dark matter disc every 35 million years , according to a report in the @entity98			1
a similar pattern was previously seen in research of comet impacts on @entity102 , which highlighted that they appear to increase every 35 million years			1
the team looked to see if there was a connection between comet impacts and the solar system moving through the dark matter disc			1
when the solar system moves through a disc , it faces a strong gravitational pull that disrupts areas such as the @entity116 cloud , which could trigger movement in space rocks towards @entity102			1
the team looked at large craters on @entity102 that were created in the last 250 million years			1
their analysis suggested that the dark matter idea would be more likely to produce the observed patterns in crater impacts than an average rate of impact			2
however , the crater that has been linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago does not completely coincide with the solar system passing through the disc			1
the paper said there 's not enough data to make this more than ‘ a fascinating possibility worthy of further exploration			0

as solar system orbits centre of galaxy , it moves around in *70m* year cycle
means it would move through a dark matter disc every 35 million years
this *corresponds* to increase in pattern of comet impacts on @entity102
researchers *conclude* this could have led to impact that has been linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago
