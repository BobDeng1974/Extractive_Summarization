risk : @entity2 governor @entity1 said voters were ' reckless ' to legalize marijuana in 2012 @entity2 governor @entity1 had admitted state voters were ' reckless ' when they legalized recreational marijuana two years ago			1
the democrat , who is seeking re-election for a second term , was asked what his advise to other states about the issue would be during a debate yesterday against @entity16 challenger , @entity15			1
mr @entity1 recommended that states should think long and hard before legalizing pot because it can increase youth access to the drug			1
he said @entity2 's vote was reckless - but added that the state 's job now was to properly regulate marijuana			1
he said : ' i would view it as reckless before we see what the consequences are			2
' i think for us to do that without having all the data , there is not enough data , and to a certain extent you could say it was reckless			1
' i 'm not saying it was reckless because i 'll get quoted everywhere , but if it was up to me i would n't have done it right ? i opposed it from the very beginning			2
' in matter of fact , all right what the hell , i 'll say it was reckless			2
' mr @entity1 , who once ran a successful brewpub , had opposed the decision to legalize the drug at the time of the november 2012 ballot			1
his opponent mr @entity15 said he agrees with @entity56 about marijuana			0
the debate in @entity59 was hosted by business groups and mostly concerned the economy			0
marijuana has been legalized in two states - @entity64 and @entity2 both passed the laws in 2012 - while a further 21 states have regulated so it can be used medicinally			1
since january 1 , 2014 , more than 200 licensed marijuana ‘ dispensaries ’ in @entity59 , @entity2 ’s biggest city — along with 100 more in other parts of the state — have been allowed to sell the drug to anyone aged 21 and over for purely ‘ recreational ’ rather than medicinal use			1
a number of other states , including @entity77 and @entity78 , will vote this year on whether to take the same step , and polls from the @entity81 and @entity82 have shown a majority of @entity84 support legalizing the drug			1
around 300 such establishments have sprung up across @entity2 since january this year use in the @entity84 has been on the rise since 2007 , possibly due in part to a perception of diminishing risks			1
in 2008 , research found that 42 per cent of people surveyed in the @entity84 had tried marijuana at least once			0
@entity1 is currently facing the toughest re-election fight of a charmed political career			2
the two - time @entity59 mayor , former geologist and successful brewpub owner sailed into the governor 's office four years ago over a divided @entity16 party that had nominated an unknown tea party favorite			0
with a self - deprecating sense of humor and an emphasis on bipartisanship , @entity1 got begrudging praise from some @entity16 state lawmakers for his first two years in office			2
but a controversial death - penalty decision , a package of gun - control bills , and mishaps explaining his choices have put a dent in @entity1 's aura of invincibility			1
cheers : governor @entity1 , who once ran a successful brew pub , enjoys a pint of beer with @entity127 now , several polls suggest he 's in a close race against @entity16 @entity15 , a former member of the @entity130			2
' i 'm going to win			0
i 'm going to work hard enough , ' @entity1 said			1
' i mean , i spent 16 years in the restaurant business ... he 's not going to outwork me			0
so , i am going to win , and this campaign is going to allow us to talk about the economy , and how are we going to create more jobs			0
' much of the firepower for @entity16 has come from @entity1 's decision to grant an indefinite stay of execution last year to @entity141 , who was convicted for the 1993 slayings of four people at a @entity145 restaurant in @entity146 , a suburb just east of @entity59			1
@entity1 's opponent @entity15 said he agreed with his rival about marijuana @entity1 's reprieve was not clemency , so he left the door open for a subsequent governor to execute @entity141 , leaving his fate unresolved			1
' since that moment ... he has to some extent been trying to play defense and recover , ' said @entity156 , an independent @entity2 pollster			2
despite the criticism , @entity1 said he believes his decision was correct			1
' i do n't think government should be taking people 's lives			0
i just do n't , ' he said			0
while @entity1 's popularity has waned , his @entity16 challenger has experienced a resurgence			2
once seen as a political laughingstock for losing the governor 's race by 17 points in 2006 , @entity15 has emerged as a solid contender for a @entity16 to win the state 's top office for the first time since 2002			0
' i do n't want to sound overly casual about it , but the kind of geeky , aw shucks , nice guy veneer that the governor had , transitioned to ( voters saying ) , ' what the heck is up with that ? '' @entity15 said			0
the buffalo rancher and former banker mostly disappeared from politics after his 2006 defeat			0
but he stayed on the radar enough through radio programs , a book he published and other writings			0
the work has provided ammunition for @entity194 seeking to describe him as an ultra-conservative candidate who opposes abortion even in cases of rape , and who would threaten immigrant rights			0
so close , that in the next two months , i think there 's great potential for one of them , in my opinion , to shoot themselves in the foot , ' @entity202 said			0
' and then i will know , ' @entity209 , i 'm going with this one , or i 'm going with that one			0

@entity1 said states should ' think long and hard ' before legalizing
@entity214 decision was reckless because they did not have *sufficient* data
@entity2 now has over 300 licensed marijuana dispensaries
other states including @entity77 and @entity78 due to vote on issue this year
