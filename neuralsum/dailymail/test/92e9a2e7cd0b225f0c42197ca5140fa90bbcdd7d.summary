@entity0 suspended more than 10,000 accounts linked to @entity3 militants and their supporters in a single 24 - hour period in a fresh crackdown on those ' tweeting violent threats '			1
jihad - watchers noticed thousands of accounts vanishing from the social network last week , most of them claiming to be linked to the extremists currently terrorising vast swathes of the @entity14			1
now , after questions were asked about what led to the largest ever one - off cull of @entity19 - affiliated accounts , @entity0 has confirmed that its purge was prompted because they were being used by tech - savvy jihadis to issue threats of violence			2
online savvy : jihad - watchers noticed thousands of accounts vanishing from the social network last week , most of them claiming to be linked to the extremists currently terrorising vast swathes of the @entity14 @entity0 does not publish data related to the accounts it suspends , but @entity33 gadgets reported that the social network 's so - called ' violations department ' suspended approximately 10,000 accounts used by @entity19 militants or supporters of the terror group on april 2			1
speaking on condition of anonymity amid fears for his safety , the representative said the cull was prompted in part by the ' large number of reports ' received by online activists and members of the public			0
without doubt this is a reference to the ' @entity55 ' campaign launched by the online ' hacktavist ' collective @entity56 , who encouraged members to find and expose thousands of accounts connected with @entity19 and report them to @entity0 authorities en masse			1
while the social network says it remains committed to the platform being used as a symbol of free speech , it says it will not tolerate accounts tweeting sickening messages promoting violence			2
@entity19 - the largest and wealthiest terrorist organisation in history - has long used social media to groom and enlist new recruits , spread sickening propaganda , and glorify rape and massacre			0
sick : @entity0 's so - called ' violations department ' suspended approximately 10,000 accounts used by the @entity19 militants themselves ( pictured ) or by supporters of the terror group , on april 2 last month it was revealed that web - savvy militants fighting for @entity19 could control as many as 90,000 @entity0 accounts worldwide , allowing them to spread their sickening propaganda with ease			1
the terror group is able to ' exert an outsized impact on how the world perceives it ' because of its shrewd use of social media and sheer number of online followers , terror experts have concluded			0
recommendations in the report by the @entity97 - based @entity96 report include governments and social media companies working together to find new ways to tackle the problem of @entity103 accounts spreading horrific murder videos and images and jihadist rhetoric			0
while @entity0 has had success in suspending the accounts , they are effectively playing an exasperating game of whack - a - mole as banned users almost - immediately set up another account			0
they then encourage @entity19 sympathisers who have not yet been banned to share the details of their new profile and within a matter of hours can have thousands of people once again reading their messages of hate .			0

thousands of accounts vanished from the social network last week
@entity0 said it had received numerous reports about terror - promoting users
*decided* to suspend 10,000 accounts for making threats of violence
suspensions were almost certainly linked to a campaign by ' hacktavist ' collective @entity56 targeting online jihadis
