workers cleaning out the home of an elderly woman in @entity3 who died found a secret treasure trove of memorabilia from the @entity7 war tribunal			1
the documents and photographs were contained in a locked trunk in the home of @entity12 , who moved to @entity14 after the war			1
when workers from the @entity18 went through the trunk looking for valuables , they discovered carbon copies of transcripts from the war trial tribunal			1
@entity12 worked as a stenographer at the @entity7 war crimes tribunal for 32 months her amazing story came to light after auctioneers discovered a trunk packed with memorabilia at her home mrs @entity33 kept documentation from the tribunal including letters from senior @entity37 on a range of matters they also found identification cards belonging to mrs @entity33 proving that she had worked at the historic trial			1
they also found a staff directory for the multinational tribunal that prosecuted scores of @entity48 masterminds in those infamous trials , a translated letter to @entity48 faithful that signs off with ' @entity52 ' and personal credentials and correspondence belonging to a lowly postwar stenographer who squirreled the mementos away for decades			1
@entity57 , who owns the auction house with her husband @entity59 said : ' it was chilling , very chilling going through that paperwork			2
' the @entity33 collection is been sold as one lot and should be of interest to military historians and collectors of @entity68 memorabilia			2

in november 1945 , the landmark @entity70 began			0
twelve of the 23 defendants , including @entity52 aide @entity73 , were sentenced to death			0
almost seven decades after the war , many institutions , including the @entity76 , have extensive collections of @entity7 trial documentation , said @entity80 , curator of modern manuscripts at the @entity76 library			2
while the @entity33 collection is interesting , it 's likely not particularly unique , he said			0
@entity57 , pictured with her husband @entity59 said reading the @entity33 collection was quite ' chilling ' among the documents held in the collection are a list of the senior nazis who were on trial for their lives the special collection will be auctioned with other @entity48 - era memorabilia on saturday in @entity14 , @entity3 but it might appeal to a private collector who wants such documents that are not already housed in a repository such as the @entity76 library , which has 600 linear feet of @entity7 documents			1
mr @entity80 said : ' it 's very possible that people like @entity33 , who was part of this pool of civilians working to support the trials , ended up with extra copies or something and saved them for souvenirs , ' ' that 's what i would assume this collection is			0
' last year , other @entity7 documents surfaced in @entity111 at a flea market in @entity113			0
that 500 - page haul eventually ended up at auction , too , where they sold for a price tag in the $ 10,000 range			0
personal correspondence found in the trunk also hints of dissatisfaction with her position as a clerk - stenographer with the @entity125 for war - training service before the war trials started			1
the @entity33 collection is being sold without any reserve in one lot on saturday according to the auctioneers the sale includes a large amount of other @entity48 memorabilia including flags , medals and badges @entity33 received a job rating of ' fair ' in 1944 , and she filed an unsuccessful appeal to the @entity140 to amend the evaluation to ' very good			1
' ' i performed a great deal more work than any other girl assigned to the same type of position , and i certainly believe that i should receive a higher rating than " fair " for work completed , especially considering the unfavorable circumstances under which i had to work , ' @entity33 wrote			0
in a may 1945 letter from the @entity153 , the board chair said @entity33 ' had not altogether convincingly rebutted ' her supervisors ' work appraisals			0

there also are plenty of @entity3 artifacts , such as ivory carvings , old photographs , even black bear and coyote head mounts			1
@entity173 is known about @entity33 's time in @entity3 , although a state fishing license was issued to her in 1951 , when she was 29 years old			2
while in @entity3 , she eventually used her married name , @entity177 , according state records			2
@entity33 died at least a decade ago , but it 's not clear exactly when she passed away			0
her 91 - year - old widower , @entity180 , lives in an @entity14 assisted living facility			2
through the auction house , he declined to comment to @entity183			0
