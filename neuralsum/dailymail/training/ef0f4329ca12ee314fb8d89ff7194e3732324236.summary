@entity1 boss @entity0 has accused people of being ' lazy ' for labelling his side as bullies every time they claim a stunning result			1
it was the case almost five weeks ago when @entity1 conjured a superb 3 - 2 @entity9 win over @entity10 , leading 3 - 0 at the break before the @entity12 finally fought back late in the second period			1
that result and performance has fired up @entity1 as they have lost just one of their last seven matches from early december going into the return league clash with @entity10 at the @entity19 on sunday			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 denies claims his side are bullies and feels the claims overshadows their ability @entity1 defender @entity24 ( left ) brings down @entity26 attacker @entity25 ( right ) @entity27 puts @entity1 ahead in the 3 - 2 victory over @entity10 in the @entity9 in december ' the last time we played them we played exceptionally well , ' said @entity0			1
' after the game some people used certain terms to explain why we beat @entity10 , such as intimidation and we bullied them out of the result , which was n't the case at all			1
' i would argue for the first 60 to 70 minutes of the game we were by far the best team on the pitch			2
we played them off the park			0
' we were the team that played the best football by getting the ball down , passing and moving and creating chances			0
' to describe us as bullies was the wrong word , a lazy term and an easy one to label us with			1
' it 's a term that goes back to bygone days when people had a different impression of us			0
' there are other terms that could have illustrated how well we played on the day , such as competitive , and there is a difference			0
@entity57 ( right ) was criticised for this foul on @entity59 ( left ) in the last game between the two sides @entity1 went 3 - 0 up over @entity10 before @entity63 's side fought back with two goals hostilities exist between the two teams since @entity67 ( right ) broke @entity69 's ( centre ) leg ' we are competitive as we look to get the ball down and play , and we have a plan a and plan b depending on the circumstances of the game			1
' we can go more direct if we feel it 's the right thing to do , but if we see weaknesses in teams then we will try and exploit them			0
' we are a different side now with different qualities , and weapons i would suggest , and we can use them to good effect			2
' if we get it right then on our day we are difficult to play against , which we have proven this year home and away			0
' the reasoning behind the ' bully ' remarks stems from the animosity that has often existed between the two teams , going back five years when @entity67 broke the leg of @entity69 in a league game in february 2010			0
bad blood has often flowed in matches between the two sides since , yet a dismissive @entity0 added : ' it just raises its head every time we play @entity10			1
' how long has it been ? five or six years ? goodness me , a lot of water has passed under the bridge			0
@entity104 ( right ) could make his @entity1 debut after signing for the club on loan from @entity108 @entity109 scored in @entity1 's win over @entity10 and could return to the side for the clash at the emirates ' we seem to have to answer the same questions every time we come up against each other			1
there are other angles to pursue other than an incident five or six years ago			0
' we 're certainly sick of it , @entity10 undoubtedly are , so everybody should move on			2
' @entity121 defender @entity104 , signed on loan for the rest of the season from @entity108 earlier this week , goes straight into the squad			0
@entity0 has four players - defenders @entity126 and @entity128 , midfielder @entity129 and striker @entity109 - who are also in the frame , although may not figure as they are returning from injury .			2

@entity0 says claims that @entity1 are bullies are lazy accusations
@entity0 feels the label takes *positive* light away from their good form
@entity1 take on @entity10 on sunday , who they beat 3 - 2 in december
