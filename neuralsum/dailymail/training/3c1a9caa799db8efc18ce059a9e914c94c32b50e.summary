the spiritual leader described @entity2 's position as ' realistic ' , but added that the free world has a ' moral responsibility ' to bring democracy to @entity6 the @entity2 government needs @entity6 money and is too scared to confront the communist state for fear of losing trade , according to the @entity12			1
speaking about recent anti-government protests in @entity16 , the @entity14 spiritual leader said @entity2 's lack of intervention was because ' the @entity2 government ’s pocket is more or less empty '			1
while he conceded that this approach was ' realistic ' , he also said that the @entity22 has a ' moral responsibility ' to help bring democracy to @entity6			0
speaking to @entity25 , he said : ' @entity6 , economically , very much wants to join the mainstream of the world economy			0
' at the same time the free world has a moral responsibility to bring @entity6 into the mainstream of democracy			0
@entity6 ’s own people also want that … so therefore i think the whole world ’s future has to be freedom and democracy			0
' i think the free world has certain responsibilities to stand firm over democracy and the rule of law and the freedom of the press			0
' @entity16 police have just finished clearing the last student protesters from the city 's financial district after the largest demonstrations @entity6 has seen since @entity48 in 1989			1
the activists were demanding freedom to chose their own candidates in upcoming local government elections , taking control of the process away from the regime in @entity56			0
the @entity12 used to be bitterly opposed to @entity6 , having been forced to flee the country into exile in 1959 after a failed revolution			1
however , since then his stance has softened and he now advocates a ' middle way ' with @entity6 authorities which would see @entity63 become autonomous , but remain part of @entity6			0
the @entity12 added that he may not have a successor after he dies , saying he would prefer that the position dies with him , rather than passing to a ' stupid ' successor the @entity12 also suggested he may be the last @entity68 spiritual leader and would rather the post faded into history than be passed to a ' stupid ' successor			1
he added that it will be ' up to the @entity68 people ' to decide what happens after his death , a remark sure to anger @entity6 , which insists it has the right to chose his successor			0
he said : ' @entity12 institution will cease one day			2
these man - made institutions will cease			0
' there is no guarantee that some stupid @entity12 wo n't come next , who will disgrace himself or herself			2
that would be very sad			0
' much better that a centuries - old tradition should cease at the time of a quite popular @entity12			2
' he also noted that the position no longer holds political responsibility , as that was passed to an elected leader of the @entity68 government in exile , @entity95 , in 2011			2
@entity96 believe the position of @entity12 is passed from one man to the next through reincarnation , with the previous leader 's spirit reborn into a new body			1
the current @entity12 , the 14th to hold the title , fled into exile from @entity6 in 1959 after a failed uprising			2
he did chose his own successor in 1995 , but @entity6 put the boy under house arrest and replaced him after the @entity12 dies it is traditionally left to the @entity109 to hunt for his successor , which can take years and involves intense meditation , with the new leader often revealed in a vision			1
the current @entity12 , real name @entity116 , is the 14th to hold the title and took four years to discover , being made leader at just 15 years old			1
he did name his own successor , known as the @entity120 , in 1995 , but @entity6 placed the boy under house arrest and put another in his place			0
it is not known where the @entity12 's choice currently is , or whether he is even alive			1
since then , the @entity12 has changed his position , saying he will not be reborn in @entity63 as long as the @entity6 regime is in power , saying @entity56 has no right to chose a leader ' for political ends			1

spiritual leader says @entity2 government 's ' pocket is more or less empty '
said @entity2 feared losing trade by speaking out over protests in @entity16
suggested he may be the last @entity12 as role has become *irrelevant*
