by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 12:10 est , 3 september 2012 he has spent the past 40 years transmitting messages from the dead and reading people ’s fortunes , but now professional ‘ psychic ’ @entity6 says it ’s time to draw back the curtain on his act			1
in a new tell - all book called ‘ @entity15 , the 61 - year - old medium , who goes by the name @entity19 , reveals the tricks of the trade that he has been using since the 1970s to make people believe in his ‘ supernatural ’ powers			1
while @entity19 ’s memoir does not reveal any shocking secrets of the profession , it effectively drives home the point of how easily people can be duped , according to the @entity26			2
medium : @entity19 , 61 , has been in the psychic business since the 1970s , reading palms and claiming to have the ability to communicate with the dead for example , the 61 - year - old psychic describes the old - fashioned trick in which he would talk to a member of the audience before the show , who would mention that his father ’s name was @entity41			1
then during the performance , @entity19 would find the man he spoke to earlier in the crowd and say , ‘ the name that comes to my mind is @entity47			0
who is @entity47 ? ’ more often than not , the targeted spectator will forget about his earlier encounter with the medium and be amazed at his ability to gaze right into his past			0
tell - all : in his new memoir , @entity15 , @entity19 shares his tricks of the trade , among them per - screening the audience ahead of a performance @entity19 ’s desire to come clean about his supernatural machinations 40 years into his career is rooted in his claim that he belongs to a special cohort of magicians , among them the duo @entity66 and @entity67 , who both perform tricks and debunk them to teach people how not to get hoodwinked in the future			1
in an interview with the @entity26 , @entity19 said that after years of sympathizing with the skeptics while capitalizing on people ’s gullibility , he felt he had to choose sides			2
‘ my conscience — i could no longer do it , ’ mr. @entity19 said			0
‘ i ’d been walking both sides of the line			0
my magician friends ’ — many of them skeptics — ‘ thought i was selling out to the psychics , and the psychics thought i was selling out to the skeptics			0
’ while @entity19 strikes a repentant tone in his no - holds - barred volume , he at times defends his craft as pure entertainment and wallows in self - pity as he attempts to straddle both sides of the moral argument			2
however , the bread - and - butter of @entity19 ’s craft is his ability to make vague , general statements about problems that are common to almost everyone , and which are most likely to hit the mark			1
‘ i sense that you have relationship issues , ’ he told one caller to the @entity98 where he had worked in the 1990s , ‘ which sometimes leave you fearful of the outcome			0
’ ambivalent : while @entity19 strikes a repentant tone in his book , he also reveals that he continues to ply the psychic trade in his off - time life imitating art : like the fictional repentant medium @entity107 in the @entity108 show @entity109 , left , @entity19 , right , says it is key for a psychic to be able to read people and know what drives them like the fictional repentant pseudo-psychic @entity107 ( played by actor @entity115 ) in the @entity108 show @entity109 , a good medium is able to read people and know what makes members of different socioeconomic classes tick			1
in one case , @entity19 told one wealthy man that ‘ what seems to be missing for you is a free space where you wo n’t be judged by your peers or have to succeed			0
’ despite his expressly stated regret at having spent years conning gullible people seeking spiritual guidance , @entity19 reveals in his memoir that he is still in the psychic business			1
mythbusters : @entity67 , left , has published numerous books on debunking magic and mystery tricks and hoaxes , while the duo @entity138 ( left ) and @entity139 ( right ) have been known to reveal their ticks on stage @entity19 has a day job working for the @entity144 @entity146 department , but in his off time , the 61 - year - old divorced father still reads palms and delivers messages from beyond			2
in his view , however , @entity19 is still one of the ‘ good guys ’ because he does not take his psychic work too seriously , injecting humour and scepticism into his predictions and readings whenever he can .			0
