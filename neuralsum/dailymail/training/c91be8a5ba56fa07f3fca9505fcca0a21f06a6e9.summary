putting on weight has a damaging effect on the heart - even if you are not overweight , new research suggests			0
for every five units of body mass index ( @entity7 ) increase in women , the risk of heart disease increases by 23 per cent - the equivalent of ageing two and a half years			1
the @entity14 researchers found that the chance of coronary heart disease ( @entity17 ) increase not just with age , but with @entity7 too , with a rise in weight carrying the same risks as getting older			1
the findings held true even in women not considered obese , with small increases in @entity7 all contributing to the increased risk , the study found			1
putting on weight has a damaging effect on the heart - even if you are not overweight , new research suggests @entity7 is a height to weight ratio , measured in units			1
the @entity34 gives a ' normal ' rating to a @entity7 of between 18.5 and 25			2
the researchers followed the health of 1.2 million women in @entity39 and @entity40 for more than a decade			2
the findings , published in journal @entity42 , showed that the occurrence of @entity17 went up by 23 per cent for each five unit increase in @entity7			1
this was the equivalent to ageing two and a half years			0
one in eleven lean middle aged women - with an average @entity7 of 21 - will be admitted to hospital or will have died from @entity17 between the ages of 55 to 74			2
but this risk progressively increases with @entity7 , and it reaches one in six , for obese women , with an average @entity7 of 34			1
study author dr @entity53 said : ' the risk of developing @entity17 increases even with small incremental increases in @entity7 , and this is seen not only in the heaviest but also in women who are not usually considered obese			1
' small changes in @entity7 , together with leading a healthy lifestyle by not smoking , avoiding excess alcohol consumption , and being physically active could potentially prevent the occurrence of @entity17 for a large number of people in the population			2
' other recent research found that office workers could be risking their health simply by sitting at their desk for hours at a time			0
the chance of heart disease increases not just with age , but with @entity7 too , with a rise in weight carrying the same risks as getting older it found people who spend more than four hours a day sitting down are at greater risk of chronic illnesses such as cancer , diabetes and heart disease			1
those sitting for at least six hours were significantly more likely to have diabetes			0
the research involved 63,048 middle - aged men but @entity85 scientists say the findings are likely to also apply to women			0
professor @entity88 , who led the study at @entity90 , said the more people sat , the bigger the health problems			0
he said ‘ we saw a steady stair - step increase in risk of chronic diseases the more participants sat. ‘ the group sitting more than eight hours clearly had the highest risk			0
’ the latest study follows research last year on 222,000 people which found sitting down too long increases your risk of dying within three years , even among the physically active .			0

the chance of heart disease increased not just with age , but with @entity7 too , @entity14 researchers found
findings held true even in women who were not obese
