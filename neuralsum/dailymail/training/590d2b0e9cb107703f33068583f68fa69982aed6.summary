mr @entity1 , who presided over the @entity8 under @entity9 , suggested @entity10 had encouraged immigration while in power to boost the economy , but he conceded they had ‘ got the sums wrong ’			1
in a bombshell intervention earlier in the week , @entity15 said throwing open @entity18 ’s borders to migrants from @entity20 had been a ‘ spectacular mistake ’			1
mr @entity15 , who was home secretary under @entity22 , said it had been ‘ a well - intentioned policy we messed up ’			1
and @entity26 , who also served under mr @entity22 , warned this week that racial tensions could ‘ explode ’ unless migrants ‘ change their culture ’ and work harder to integrate in @entity18			1
@entity10 ’s reputation on immigration has been shredded following a 2004 decision to not restrict workers when eight former @entity36 bloc countries joined the @entity37			0

' events proved these forecasts worthless ' concession : @entity26 , here in 2004 with @entity22 , also warned the influx of migrants could cause riots ‘ so for @entity79 , @entity18 and @entity80 , the three most successful economies – although you might wonder what that success was based on – there was a lot of sense in doing that			1
