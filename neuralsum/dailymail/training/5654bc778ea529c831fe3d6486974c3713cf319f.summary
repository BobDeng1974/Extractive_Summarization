an amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike ' into space ' above the @entity4			0
the atmospheric phenomena , known as sprites , had never been recorded in the @entity7 before an amateur astronomer in @entity9 managed to take the photographic first			1
@entity11 , 33 , spotted the sprite - caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of @entity14 - and has sparked excitement in the scientific community with his image			1
an amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike ' into space ' ( pictured ) above the @entity4			0
the atmospheric phenomena , known as sprites , had never been recorded in the @entity7 before sprites are shards of light caused by large - scale electrical discharges that take place high above thunderstorm clouds			1
they cause a varied range of visual shapes in the night sky but have never been recorded before in the @entity7			1
mr @entity11 spotted the sprite on tuesday night from a camera set up in @entity14			1
he said : ' astronomy is my hobby , i am not a scientist so i am delighted to have captured the sprite , it was such an interesting event			0
' they are a fascinating phenomena as they happen in the atmosphere above the storm clouds			0
' they are relatively unknown and it looked a little special so i sent it to dr @entity46 at @entity47 and he said it was the first spotted over the @entity7			2
' i think luck had a lot to do with it			0
' mr @entity11 spotted the sprite on a camera that is part of the @entity7 @entity53 , which amateur stargazers can use to observe space			1
@entity11 spotted the sprite , caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of @entity14			1
his photograph has sparked excitement in the scientific community dr @entity46 , an expert in the electrodynamic properties of the atmosphere at the @entity47 , has carried out a number of studies on sprites			0
he said : ' this particular sprite is a rare example of sprites that can occur over the @entity69			1
' the lightning flash inside the thunderstorm , which caused the sprite above the cloud was also unique			2
' the @entity73 recorded the thunderstorm using the @entity75 lightning detection network , which is ordinarily used for real - time forecasts of flash floods , hail , and wind gusts often associated with thunderstorms			2
@entity80 , foundation scientist for the @entity73 , said : ' the @entity75 lightning location system operated by the @entity73 picked up widespread and particularly intense storms across the @entity7 during tuesday 23 july			2
' the storms detected in the region near @entity14 developed around the wash before moving northwards , but were of only moderate intensity and were small compared with some other storms that occurred on that day in other areas			0
' the first colour image of a sprite was captured as part of a 1994 @entity94 / @entity93 aircraft campaign to study the rare lightning strikes			0
the red color was found to be from nitrogen fluorescent emissions excited by a lightning stroke in the underlying thunderstorm @entity100 , who develops lightning detectors for @entity102 , a @entity103 - based company , predicted sprites would occur during thunderstorms approaching the @entity7 from the @entity106 with his electrical sensors			1
he said mr @entity11 was very fortunate to catch this extremely rare phenomenon on camera			2
dr @entity46 said : ' citizen scientists can play a major role in unravelling the mysteries of lightning into space			0
' it is well known that upward lightning is a necessary condition to initiate lightning into space , but upward lightning alone is not sufficient			0
' there are yet unknown factors which will be investigated in more detail during two upcoming space missions due to be carried out by the @entity125 and @entity126 in 2015			0
' citizen scientists can make a major contribution by reporting sprite occurrence times			0
' sprites are shards of light are caused by large - scale electrical discharges which take place high above thunderstorm clouds ( pictured )			1
they cause a varied range of visual shapes in the night sky but had never been recorded before in the @entity7			1

sprites - shards of light caused by large electrical discharges high above thunderstorm clouds - have never before been recorded in the @entity7
amateur photographer @entity11 took the photo of the sprite on tuesday night in @entity9
one expert has *confirmed* the *sighting* is a rare example of sprites that can occur over the @entity69
