by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are unlikely to retreat to a monastery again if they fail to beat @entity4 in @entity5 on thursday night , even though you might think @entity7 and his players would need a little divine intervention to qualify from @entity10 worry not			1
they were in a tighter corner than this and reached the quarter - finals at the 1986 @entity15 in @entity16 when , ultimately , the @entity17 was not quite so kind to them			1
that was the last time @entity2 lost their opening group fixture , going down 1 - 0 to @entity20 in @entity21			1
@entity15 bother : @entity7 is in need of a result against @entity4 on thursday in @entity10 spirit of 86 : @entity25 scores against @entity26 during a crucial 3 - 0 win in @entity16 it went from bad to worse in the second game when captain @entity30 dislocated his shoulder and @entity32 was sent off for throwing the ball at the referee in the first half of a goalless draw against eventual group winners @entity38			1
‘ it was clear the balance was n’t right in the team , ’ said @entity39 , one of four players called into the starting line - up for the make - or - break encounter with @entity26			1
‘ where we were in @entity21 , it was like a desert and @entity49 decided to take us up into the hills to a monastery for a team meeting			2
‘ we had a frank and open chat where everyone gave a view on what was wrong or right			0
@entity57 spoke up and said his piece and i suggested a few things to @entity49 , too			0
‘ he took it all on board and then came up with a system to put @entity64 on the right , @entity66 on the left and @entity68 in the hole playing off @entity25			0
i came in alongside @entity70 and it all seemed to fit in training			0
‘ we did n’t have the extra social media to contend with , like today ’s players			0
but we knew from being able to get the @entity75 and through messages relayed from home that the pressure was on and people had been disappointed by what they ’d seen			0
experience : @entity39 speaks about one of the best performances from @entity2 under pressure despair : @entity85 scores the winner as @entity20 beat @entity2 in the first group game ‘ we expected as much anyway but it helped us grow very focused			1
‘ the players who were n’t playing like @entity92 and @entity93 were really getting behind the lads who were picked and we developed not just a good team spirit but squad spirit , a real unity			2
’ what followed was one of @entity2 ’s greatest @entity15 performances			2
the partnership of @entity103 and @entity68 blossomed immediately , @entity103 bagging a first - half hat - trick as @entity30 ’s new - look team blew away the @entity106 and pipped their opponents to second place on goal difference			2
the situation in @entity111 is not as serious — yet — after the opening defeat by @entity113 in @entity114 last saturday but @entity7 is already facing calls to drop @entity116 or switch him from the left to a more central role against @entity4			0
key man : @entity25 celebrates after helping the @entity2 qualify for the next round against the odds ‘ i suppose there are a few similarities in how the current team shapes up , ’ added @entity39			1
‘ firstly , i think our two top players — @entity127 and @entity116 — need to turn up for the party and step up their game			0
‘ as good as @entity130 is , i still think @entity64 should have dominated him better and will want to impose himself on @entity4 with more potency			0
‘ you could n’t wish to set up a better goal than the one @entity116 put on for @entity134 , but he would benefit from playing in that @entity68 role rather than left wing			0
‘ @entity2 did n’t do an awful lot wrong against @entity113 and there ’s no doubt they have enough to beat @entity4			1
‘ they ca n’t afford to lose and focusing the mind on needing to win may give them the extra push they need			2
’ pressure : things are n't as bad for @entity2 yet ... they just need to replicate their @entity113 display @entity147 : @entity2 - qualifying goals , key players and the manager			1
