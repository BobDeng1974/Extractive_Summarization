empty chairs were laid out in @entity1 today in honour of the 11,541 people killed in the city during the @entity6 war which began exactly 20 years ago			1
the seats - lined up along the city 's main street - were left empty in memory of the victims of the 44 - month @entity13 siege of the city			1
hundreds of the chairs are small representing the children slain in the conflict			2
@entity6 remembers : 11,541 red chairs are pictured along @entity19 street in @entity1 as the city marks the 20th anniversary of the start of the @entity6 war , april 6 , 2012 a city in grief : the chairs are arranged in 825 rows and look like a red river running through the city			1
special small chairs have been laid out for the children who died in the conflict exhibitions , concerts and performances are being held across the city today two decades after the conflict began on april 6 , 1992			1
' this city needs to stop for a moment and pay tribute to its killed citizens , ' said @entity37 , organizer of the ' @entity38			2
' the @entity13 siege of @entity1 went on for - 11,825 days - longer than the @entity41 siege of @entity42 , now @entity42			1
its 380,000 people were left without electricity , water or heat , hiding from the 330 shells a day that smashed into the city			2
exactly 20 years ago today some 40,000 people from all over the country - @entity53 , @entity50 and @entity51 - poured into the square to demand peace from their quarreling nationalist politicians			2
grieving for the dead : bouquets of flowers are laid out on some of the chairs in the centre of @entity1 today - 20 years after the start of a 44 - month siege @entity65 united : exhibitions , concerts and performances are being held across the city today two decades after the conflict began on april 6 , 1992 destruction : the frontline in @entity6 was here on the mountain @entity74			1
@entity77 forces fired shells from this position ( file photo ) the @entity81 had recognised the former @entity83 republic of @entity6 as an independent state after most of its people voted for independence			2
but the people voted along ethnic lines , with @entity6 and @entity89 voting for independence , and @entity6 @entity13 preferring to stay with @entity13 - dominated @entity83			2
the ethnic unity being displayed on the @entity1 square irritated @entity13 nationalists , who then shot into the crowd from a nearby hotel , killing five people and igniting the 1992 - 1995 war			1
the @entity13 nationalists , helped by neighboring @entity13 , laid siege to @entity1 and within a few months occupied 70 percent of @entity6 , expelling all non-serbs from territory they controlled			1
meanwhile @entity6 and @entity89 - who started off as allies - turned against each other , so all three groups ended up fighting a war that took over 100,000 lives , made half of the population homeless and left the once - ethnically mixed country devastated and divided into mono - ethnic enclaves			2
@entity110 : a young boy peers through the snow covered windshield as he 's grandfather tries to start their car that stopped on the infamous sniper alley in @entity1 on november 18 , 1995 civil war : a man walks on the so - called ' sniper alley ' in @entity1 after buying a can of oil donated by the @entity81 a 1995 peace agreement brokered by the @entity124 ended the shooting but its compromises left the nation ethnically divided into two ministates - one for @entity13 , the other shared by @entity6 and @entity89 - linked by a central government			1
the result is a bureaucratic monstrosity : @entity6 has three rotating presidents at the state level and each ministate has its own president - that 's five presidents in all			0
there are 13 prime ministers in total , over 130 ministers , more than 760 lawmakers and 148 municipalities			0
not only does this cost the impoverished nation of 3.5 million over 50 percent of its annual gdp but it leads to endless bickering between institutions			0
@entity149 insists @entity6 must be more centralised but that goes against @entity13 ' desire to maintain their autonomy			0
@entity153 was one of those @entity13 soldiers firing from the mountains on @entity1 during the war			1
' we did not fight this war for nothing , ' he says			0
' we have our @entity160 , we have our government , we have our president , we have our own institutions			0
' ethnic mistrust or economic differences between the mini-states are keeping the groups in @entity6 separated			0
@entity168 - marked : the @entity170 square in @entity1 is seen through a 20 year old shrapnel hole in a building currently under renovation a sign ' for sale ' is placed onto a war damaged house in an abandoned village by the main road near the town of @entity181 march 27 , 2007 children in school are learning three different version of history , calling their common language by three different names - @entity13 , @entity6 and @entity89 - and are growing isolated from each other in monoethnic enclaves			1
foreign investors - the only hope for the country 's economy - are avoiding @entity6 for its political instability and its enormous bureaucracy			0
the pressure to join the @entity197 has united some of the country 's institutions			0
@entity6 now has a common currency , a central bank , its two ministate police forces are run by a joint ministry			0
there is a state court , border police on state level and even a joint army - melded from the three that once fought each other			0
now those same soldiers from all three armies are united , protesting together over a lack of retirement pay and jobs in the same central @entity1 square			1
dressed in old uniforms , exhausted and unshaved , @entity13 , @entity6 and @entity89 sleep and eat at this doomed square , occasionally shouting up to nearby government offices ' thieves , thieves ! ' the former soldiers say they are here to defend @entity6 from lying politicians			0
many of them were only 17 in 1992 when the ethnically mixed crowd gathered to demand peace but was cheated			0
' we will be here together till the end , demanding our rights , ' said @entity233 , a @entity77 veteran			0
remembered : a @entity53 woman walks near a banner with the number 11,541 , to symbolise red chairs , along @entity19 street in @entity1 as the city marks the 20th anniversary of the start of the @entity6 war			1
