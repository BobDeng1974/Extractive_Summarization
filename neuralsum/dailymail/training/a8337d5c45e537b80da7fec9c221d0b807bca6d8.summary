@entity0 are resigned to being without @entity1 and @entity2 for their @entity4 opener against @entity5 and there are on - going doubts about two of their other casualties			1
the national team ’s injury crisis continues to rage on unchecked , with wednesday 's confirmation that @entity14 centre @entity1 and @entity15 lock @entity2 will miss the trip to @entity17 next friday			1
those setbacks add to an absentee list which already features @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			0
@entity1 and @entity24 ( right ) take a stroll at @entity26 as @entity0 train on tuesday but there may be further setbacks in the offing , as head coach @entity31 and his assistants await updates on the state of @entity36 ’s ankle and @entity38 ’s shoulder			1
at this stage , the severity of the injuries hampering the @entity42 flanker and @entity44 centre remain unclear , but they must be considered in grave danger of missing at least the clash with @entity5			0
@entity31 tried to adopt a positive tone at the tournament launch on wednesday morning , saying : ‘ the current situation is that @entity2 and @entity1 are in pretty good shape really			1
we do n't anticipate the injuries will be any more than a couple of weeks really			0
we will see how they go over the next 24 hours but we are pretty optimistic about @entity2 and @entity1			2
‘ @entity36 and @entity38 are going to have further assessments that are going to take place in the next 24 hours and we will have a bit more information on that after those assessments			2
’ @entity38 ( right ) is still not fully fit as he recovers from a shoulder injury @entity36 has an ankle injury which may rule him out of @entity0 's clash with @entity5 @entity31 ( right , with @entity66 at the @entity4 launch ) has mounting injury problems asked about the anticipated timescale for @entity1 and @entity70 to back available again , he added : ‘ obviously the clock is ticking for the @entity5 game , but i would n't rule @entity2 and @entity1 out of the @entity74 game just yet			1
‘ we need all the players who are going to be considered for the @entity5 game to be training on sunday and monday			0
if that comes too soon we will rehab and get them back and they might take part in training towards the end of the week but the view then would be to try to get them to begin training the week of the @entity74 game			0
‘ i am very confident that @entity1 and @entity2 are going to be fine sooner rather than later			2
i do n't want to commit on @entity36 and @entity38 because it is going to rest very much on what the specialists say			0
but @entity36 has made good progress and with @entity38 we will have to wait and see			0
’ @entity87 matches will be shown on @entity88 february 6 : @entity5 vs. @entity0 ( @entity89 ) at 20.05 february 7 : @entity74 vs. @entity90 ( @entity91 ) at 14.30 february 7 : @entity92 vs. @entity93 ( @entity94 ) at 17.00 february 14 : @entity0 vs. @entity74 ( @entity95 ) at 14.30 february 14 : @entity90 vs. @entity92 ( @entity96 ) at 17.00 february 15 : @entity93 vs. @entity5 ( @entity97 ) at 15.00 february 28 : @entity93 vs. @entity74 ( @entity97 ) at 14.30 february 28 : @entity92 vs. @entity5 ( @entity94 ) at 17.00 march 1 : @entity90 vs. @entity0 ( @entity96 ) at 15.00 march 14 : wales vs. @entity90 ( @entity89 ) at 14.30 march 14 : @entity0 vs. @entity93 ( @entity95 ) at 17.00 march 15 : @entity74 vs. @entity92 ( @entity91 ) at 15.00 march 21 : @entity74 vs. @entity5 ( @entity91 ) at 12.30 march 21 : @entity93 vs. @entity90 ( @entity97 ) at 14.30 march 21 : @entity0 vs. @entity92 ( @entity95 ) at 17.00			1
