he appeared to be suffering from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( @entity13 ) , a condition characterized by headache , confusion , seizures and visual loss			1
a 10 - year - old boy suffered four seizures which doctors found was due to his habit of eating 20 liquorice sweets a day for four months but doctors were baffled as @entity25 and @entity26 scans ruled out all the major condition that lead to pres. during a medical examination a week later doctors noticed that the boy ’s teeth were black			1
it transpired that he had been eating at least 20 liquorice sweets each day for the past four months			2
this mean he was consuming of 2.88 mg / kg of glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid , one of the active ingredients of liquorice			2
that volume is well above the @entity44 ’s recommended maximum of 2 mg / kg. this excessive consumption had resulted in his development of high blood pressure , and in turn @entity13 after the boy stopped eating the sweets , his treatment was gradually reduced and his blood pressure returned to normal			1

@entity62 , 68 , was struck down with @entity109 after consuming too many of the sweets			0
they gave him an upset stomach and doctors believe the antibodies he produced to fight the bug caused his body to react badly - and mr @entity62 then developed the deadly nerve disease			0
within weeks , he was completely paralysed – and he only managed to relearn to walk again a year later .			0
