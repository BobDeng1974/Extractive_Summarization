by @entity0 published : 12:20 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 13:43 est , 3 may 2013 this is the moment a jet pilot came within yards of a disastrous mid-air crash with a helicopter over the @entity5 on tuesday			2
the dramatic picture , which was captured over @entity7 in the @entity5 , appears to show the undercarriage of the fighter jet close to touching the rotating blades of the helicopter			1
aviation experts believe that the two aircraft may have passed within 2,000 - 3,000 ft of each other - putting them just 650 yards apart			1
close call ? a tornado jet comes within yards of what is believed to be a @entity19 helicopter above the @entity5 no reports : despite what appears to be photographic evidence of a near - miss , the @entity23 , which investigates such incidents , has not received any reports relating to this sighting the fighter jet is believed to be a tornado while the helicopter is said to be a @entity19 which was possibly spraying the moors at the time			1
but despite what appears to be photographic evidence of a near - miss , the @entity23 , which investigates such incidents , has not received any reports relating to this sighting			1
and , according to the @entity36 , the picture suggests that the two aircraft are too far apart to be classified as a close call			2
@entity39 , from the @entity36 , said : ' my initial impression is that this is not an airprox - near miss - incident and that the two aircraft are in fact several miles apart			2
' in reality , the helicopter is less than half the size of the jet , but it appears bigger in the photo			0
' this would lead me to think that the jet is actually 2,000ft to 3,000ft in the distance from the helicopter			0
' fighter jet : the plane involved in the incident is believed to be a tornado ( stock image ) an airprox , or near - miss , is classed as a situation where a pilot or air traffic controller feels the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed has compromised the safety of the aircraft , according to the @entity23			1
there are around 200 reported airprox incidents each year			0
around 10 per cent of those reports are said to involve gliders			0
a passenger jet pilot reported in december that his aircraft came within just 300ft of colliding with an unidentified flying object			0
the shocked pilot reported the collision risk as ‘ high ’ .			0

two aircraft were pictured close together over @entity7
aviation experts believe they were around 650 yards apart
the @entity82 @entity23 has received no reports of a near miss
