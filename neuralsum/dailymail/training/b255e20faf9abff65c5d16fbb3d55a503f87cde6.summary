a heavily pregnant woman was forced to undergo a humiliating medical examination on a packed plane to prove that she was fit to fly			1
@entity3 was horrified when staff on the @entity6 flight ordered her to the front of the plane in front of passengers to be checked by two doctors in an area where food is prepared			1
miss @entity3 , who was 35 weeks pregnant , and showing no signs of going into labour , was eventually escorted off the flight with her partner and three young children			1
this was despite the 32 - year - old carrying documentation from her gp stating that she was fit to travel			1
@entity3 , pictured with her son @entity21 , was forced to undergo a humiliating internal exam at the front of the plane after flight staff apparently decided she was too close to her due date to fly then , instead of the usual four - hour flight from @entity28 to @entity29 , the family had to endure a 19 - hour marathon before finally stepping through their front door			1
miss @entity3 said : ‘ the way were treated was an absolute disgrace , and we have n’t even had an apology from @entity6			2
‘ to say it was an ordeal is an understatement			0
i was upset and sobbing , but they did n’t take any notice , and just kept saying : “ it ’ll be ok ”			0
’ miss @entity3 , who was pregnant with son @entity21 , now three months old , was due to fly out of @entity28 after a week away when she was approached on board and told that she had to be examined by medical staff based at @entity44			1
the women doctors took her blood pressure and checked her bump , before carrying out an intrusive examination in the plane ’s front galley			2
miss @entity3 said : ‘ they did n’t carry out the examination in any sort of sterile way			1
‘ and i ca n’t believe we were thrown off the plane as it was obvious i was not in labour			0
’ she said she was left fearing she would have to stay in @entity28 to give birth			0
‘ how do you get home from @entity28 if you can not fly ? ’ miss @entity3 said			2
‘ i was thinking , i ’m stuck here for at least seven weeks			0
what about my children ? i only had a week ’s clothes			2
’ ms @entity3 , 32 , had checked she would be okay to fly ( boarding pass pictured left ) - and even had a note from her doctors showing she was under the 36 week cut off ( right ) ms @entity3 said the experience left her humiliated - but @entity6 , which was not operating the flight that day , have refused to take any responsibility after being taken off the plane last september , miss @entity3 , her partner and children @entity71 , ten , @entity72 , nine , and @entity73 , six , then endured a 19 - hour ordeal to get home			1
first they had a lengthy wait for a flight to @entity80 – rather than their preferred destination of @entity29			1
as a result they then had to sit on a minibus to get to their home in @entity87 , @entity88			0
@entity90 advice states that it is normally safe to fly while you are pregnant - but it is the airlines which decide whether or not to let you fly towards the end			1
@entity95 says it restricts travel beyond the end of the 36th week , while people carrying twins or triplet can not fly beyond the end of the 32nd week			0
however , the airline does say it would like women to carry a doctors note after the 28th week , confirming due date and the fact it is n't complicated			2
@entity107 allows mothers to fly until the 35th week , and women carrying twins until the 32nd			0
@entity111 has the same cut off dates as @entity95 , and asks mothers to carry the letter from 28 weeks - but says it reserves the right to refuse travel from this point if they do n't have one			1
@entity120 asks for letter after the 29th week , but has the same cut off dates as @entity95			2
miss @entity3 said that the family was not offered any vouchers for food or water while they waited for the later flight , and said she ran up a £ 100 phone bill calling relatives in distress			1
she added : ‘ you go with these big companies because you think they have procedures , but it means nothing			0
the whole situation shows how you have no rights			0
we can not protect ourselves			0
’ before flying , miss @entity3 had sought the advice of her gp on four occasions , and said she checked with @entity143 as instructed by their staff because she was concerned about the timing of the holiday , which she had booked before she was aware she was pregnant			1
she said she even requested her gp to fax to @entity143 ’s headquarters documentation permitting her to fly			0
however , @entity6 , whose rules state a woman can fly up to 36 weeks pregnant , has distanced itself from the incident , claiming that the flight was operated by a third party			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we are sorry to hear of miss @entity3 ’s experience on the return from her holiday in @entity28			2
‘ on this occasion the flight was not operated by us but by a third party airline			0
as every airline has its own policy regarding flying during pregnancy we advised miss @entity3 to speak directly to this airline prior to travel to avoid any potential issues			0
‘ as we understand miss @entity3 has instructed a solicitor , it would be inappropriate for us to comment further			0

@entity3 , from @entity29 , had been *enjoying* a holiday with her family
the 32 - year - old was 35 weeks pregnant - within @entity143 **'s** 36 week cut - off
despite having a doctor **'s** note , she was made to undergo an examination
the examination took place in the food preparation area of the plane
ms @entity3 , her partner and children were then made to get off the flight
@entity143 has apologised - and said it was not operating the flight that day
