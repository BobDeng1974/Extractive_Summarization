by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 8 july 2013 it reportedly cost $ 225million to produce but @entity3 's latest release - @entity4 - has failed to excite movie - goers and has $ 16million of debt to claw back			1
starring @entity8 , the producers simply thought their modern take on a western would appeal to a greater audience , but in fact , few under 25s have opted to see the film			0
made by the same team that created the lucrative @entity3 franchise ' @entity15 ' - the four film series that grossed $ 3.7 billion worldwide - the @entity18 drew bad reviews and failed to capture the attention of younger moviegoers			1
based on the long - running radio programme begun in 1933 and the tv series that debuted in 1949 , the ' @entity4 ' brand proved a musty one			2
the audience for the film skewed heavily toward older moviegoers , with 68 per cent of its audience older than 25			0
' you think that you have everything in place , ' said @entity30 , listing the proven box - office commodities of @entity8 , @entity49 and producer @entity50			2
' even when you have all the ingredients for what you think will be a four - quadrant , ` everybody ' picture , sometimes it does n't work out that way			0
' the poor performance of ' @entity4 " called to mind a previous bomb for @entity3 : last year 's similarly - budgeted science - fiction adventure " @entity61 , ' which opened with $ 30.1 million			1
but ' @entity4 ' , which stars @entity62 as the masked lawman , will likely fare better than that disappointment , since @entity8 's international star power should bring in better worldwide business			2
it started with $ 24.3 million abroad , opening in about 30 percent of its planned international market			0
@entity69 : domestic box office numbers so far suggest the animated minions , with a price tag one third of what ' @entity4 ' cost to make , is outperforming the masked man by more than three to one while critics skewered the film , it did earn a decent @entity80 from moviegoers			1
but ' @entity4 ' is nevertheless likely to be a sizeable write - down for @entity3 and could impact the company 's stock price when markets reopen monday			1
' everybody beat up on @entity4 pretty hard , ' said @entity87 , analyst for box - office tracker @entity88			2
' everything was just not going in its favor			0
' @entity49 's reimagining of the iconic lawman bombed for the @entity3 , opening with just $ 29.4million over the weekend , and a disappointing $ 48.9million since wednesday			1
on the other hand , @entity94 , which made sequel ' @entity69 ' for the comparatively small amount of $ 76million , took $ 82.5 million over the weekend and $ 142.1million across the five - day holiday window			1
promoting : @entity8 , pictured in @entity99 last month promoting the @entity4 , is the star of the @entity3 film the better than expected haul ( along with another $ 88.8 million overseas ) establishes ' @entity27 ' , which stars @entity102 as a diabolical villain turned stay - at - home dad , as a new franchise for @entity94 and @entity107 's @entity106 , the @entity94 - backed animation company			1
@entity108 , head of distribution for @entity94 , attributed the strong performance to @entity107 , the robust appetite for summer family films , and , above all , those teaming little yellow guys			0
the ' minions ' will get their own spin - off in 2014 , and @entity117 said another ' @entity27 ' film is a certainty			0
' the minions steal everybody 's heart , ' @entity117 said			0
' it 's a great time of the year to release a family film with broad appeal			2
' stand - up @entity126 's concert documentary ' @entity126 : let me explain ' proved savvy counter-programming for @entity130 , opening with $ 17.5million over five days and $ 10.1million over the weekend			1
@entity132 's family comedy ' @entity133 ' ( which also stars @entity102 ) opened in 19 theaters with a strong theater average of about $ 30,000			0
it slowly expands for a july 26 national release .			0

*estimates* show @entity4 took just $ 29.4million over the weekend
animation @entity69 stormed *ahead* with $ *82.5million* during that time
high - cost of @entity3 's western has left producer out of *pocket* by millions
