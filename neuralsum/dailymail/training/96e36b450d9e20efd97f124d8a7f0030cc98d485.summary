in 2006 everybody hailed @entity1			1
they had finally relented , after more than a century of wearing that unblemished , iconic , red - and - blue striped shirt , and taken on a sponsor			0
except that instead of a beer brand or appliances company it was @entity9			2
and they paid the charity for it too , with over £ 1million annually going towards its projects			1
on the pitch , @entity1 dived , fouled and cheated as much as any other team , but in between the gaps they played fabulous , expansive football			2
purists adored them , millions dreamed of the opportunity to watch the likes of @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and the rest at the @entity27			0
they were everybody ’s ' second team '			0
it refers to their commitment to matters beyond the football pitch , social and political affairs both local and global			0
the slogan was initially invented by president @entity50 in 1968 , concerning their backing of @entity54 society , which had been attacked by @entity56 dictator @entity55			0
@entity55 ’s dictatorship tried to end the club ’s social significance , removing the @entity54 stripes from the crest			0
@entity62 passed , @entity55 died , @entity56 became democratic again and @entity1 wanted to apply their slogan to more than just @entity64			2
‘ @entity66 has extended its social commitment to the rest of the planet , ’ announces the club website , proudly			1
it heralded the @entity9 deal as a specifically significant marker for this			1
but in recent years there have been numerous decisions made by the club which have flung it from their self - made throne and down , down into the mire , with all the other football clubs			2
the shirt is in danger of becoming more like a @entity85 car than a football jersey			0
this week they have added @entity89 appliances firm @entity88 to it , with its logo emblazoned on the sleeve			1
deal : @entity66 's signed a deal with @entity95 to be their main shirt sponsor in 2013 generous : previously @entity66 paid charity @entity9 £ 1million a year to be able to emblazon their logo @entity99 set to leave @entity1 to play in @entity100 in the middle of the shirt is the far more controversial @entity95 sponsorship			1
it is the successor to @entity105 , which ended @entity1 ’s stance of refusing commercial shirt sponsorship			1
the @entity9 logo was been moved to another , less notable position on the shirt and from the start of the 2011 - 12 season @entity1 began to benefit from a £ 125m sponsorship deal			1
late last year , @entity1 announced a new shirt sponsorship deal , with @entity117 advertising inside of the shirt			1
@entity117 ’s marketing officer @entity119 described it as ' more than sponsorship '			0
perhaps a play on words on @entity1 ’s club slogan , perhaps an unfortunate coincidence			1
but it highlighted how the attitude towards the previously pure , clean shirt had changed			0
and sponsorships are the tip of the iceberg			0
there have been some dubious practices going on at the club in recent times			0
the pursuit of @entity32 is the latest of them			2
this is a footballer who has been found guilty of racism by the @entity140			0
who dives and cheats like the best of ‘ em , who has recently bitten an opposition player for the third time			0
treble : @entity66 had no sponsor for more than 100 years but @entity89 firm @entity88 have become their third core values : up until 2006 @entity1 were steadfast in their determination not to have a sponsor on their shirt and yet , despite biting @entity157 and subsequently being issued a four - month global ban , @entity1 ’s club president and sporting director both described him as ‘ honourable ’ and new signing @entity161 said that his apology made him ‘ a noble man ’			1
bear in mind that this apology reads like it was spoken through gritted teeth , just days after claiming that he stumbled and fell into @entity157			0
@entity170 in mind that @entity1 required @entity32 to apologise before they could make a move for him			1
what @entity1 have been bearing in mind , above any qualms about @entity32 compromising their club conscience , is that a front line comprised of @entity177 , @entity178 and the @entity179 would be nigh - on unstoppable			1
the @entity180 @entity32 will be playing with , @entity178 , came to the club under a storm cloud too			1
the repercussions of his transfer deal affected the club long into the season , with @entity1 paying £ 11.1m to the tax authorities that they had evaded during the deal			1
pursuit : @entity66 are determined to sign @entity190 forward @entity32 this summer controversial : @entity66 's pursuit of @entity32 is in spite of the fact he has bitten three separate opponents @entity66 's praise for sorry @entity32 @entity1 denied any fiscal wrongdoing , stating that they were merely making a complimentary donation to the government to cover ' any potential interpretation made concerning the contract '			1
in reality , the signing of @entity178 which , initially , appeared as if it were a £ 49m deal , could have cost more than £ 71m			2
@entity1 ’s president at the time , @entity205 , resigned , and the man who followed him , @entity206 , described the whole thing as ‘ embarrassing ’			2
then , there was the treatment of @entity210			1
the @entity1 defender claimed that he was not paid while he was recovering from a liver transplant			2
he said : ‘ what was hard to understand was what @entity1 said during my last press conference			2
by saying that it was a professional choice , it made other clubs doubt			0
it was n’t even a question of money			0
the proof being that all the months i was ill , the club did n’t pay me			2
’ pay : @entity223 @entity210 claims @entity66 did not give him his wages during his recovery from cancer fee : @entity66 failed to disclose the full payments made for @entity178 during his transfer last summer @entity66 charged with € 9m tax fraud over @entity178 transfer @entity1 refuted this , saying that they had paid for it mostly , with only a ‘ very small ’ part coming from medical insurers			1
the reason @entity1 want to buy @entity32 , as well as @entity161 , @entity237 and @entity238 , is because the threat of a transfer ban still looms over them			1
they were given this ban for disobeying @entity243 instructions over the transfers of minors , with 10 under - 18 players they signed contravening legislation			0
on appeal , their ban has been suspended , so they are making all their necessary deals this summer in case it eventually gets upheld			0
all of this has left the club ’s waters murky , like the sea by @entity257 beach after the city ’s famous all - night @entity259 ’s eve festival			0
if the good times of decades past at the @entity27 were the party , we are currently in the madrugada - the twilight hour - knee - deep in filth , waiting for the clean - up operation to begin .			0

@entity1 did not have any sponsors on their shirts until 2006
their first ' sponsorship ' saw them pay charity @entity9 £ 1million a year
@entity95 now pay £ 125m for their five - year deal as sponsors
@entity89 firm @entity277 will now appear on the sleeves of @entity66 shirts
club pursuing deal for @entity32 despite him biting three opponents
@entity210 claims @entity66 did not pay him during his cancer treatment
