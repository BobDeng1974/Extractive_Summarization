an aspiring foreign manager emboldened by radical ideas meets a settled , ego - fuelled dressing room that ’s enjoyed no little success			1
sound familiar ? for @entity9 , the warning signs upon appointing @entity5 to the @entity8 manager ’s post last summer were to be found not a million miles from home			1
when @entity12 arrived at @entity13 in the summer of 2006 , there seemed solid grounds for fans of the @entity17 club not to question if the @entity18 would be a runaway success , but to just what extent			1
@entity8 manager @entity5 ( left ) and chief executive @entity9 launch new kit deal at @entity22 @entity9 has dismissed comparison between @entity5 and former @entity13 boss @entity12 ( right ) after a difficult start , @entity5 has started to turn things around at @entity22 this was , after all , not only a coach who had brought three successive titles to the @entity30 club @entity29 , but one who had made them a name to be feared across @entity34			1
if le @entity12 could drop just a little of his @entity36 into the @entity17 water , the sky would be the limit			1
so went the theory , anyway			2
yet , by january 4 the following year , the @entity18 was already history — his departure a cautionary tale of too much , too soon , resistance to change and the importance of unstinting backing from the boardroom			1
disastrous though le @entity12 ’s short tenure was , to this day it ’s only natural for the rump of the @entity13 support to wonder what might have transpired had he been afforded more time			1
fast - forward eight years to the start of this season and — on the other half of the city — parallels with the @entity18 were being drawn			1
whilst @entity58 were much further down the football food - chain than @entity29 , @entity5 still arrived with the pedigree of being a league winner as a manager			1
and , just as le @entity12 had faced resistance from a squad used to @entity66 ’s methods for so long , much of the @entity68 ’s methodology was bound to grate with a squad that had thrived under @entity70			1
when domestic reverses began to intertwine with @entity34 capitulations , there seemed a danger that history might repeat itself			2
@entity29 's former league winning manager @entity76 arrived at @entity17 with a big reputation in 2006 the @entity18 left @entity13 the following january after losing games and the dressing room ‘ when we set off with him , we knew we were going to give him time , ’ @entity9 insisted			1
‘ if you go back to le @entity83 — i always say to @entity5 about the “ le @entity12 hump ”			1
‘ when he came in , he ’d won three - in - a - row in @entity18 , had new ideas , a new philosophy and a new culture			1
‘ it did n’t work			2
it was revolution rather than evolution			2
the players revolted and he went out			2
‘ so we had to get over that le @entity83 hump if you like and manage through that			2
‘ you get the players on board and get everything settled down			2
he ’s done that brilliantly			2
’ notwithstanding wednesday ’s home defeat to @entity103 , there is no disputing the fact that both the manager and his players are now in a much brighter place			2
earlier this week , @entity108 eloquently described how he now looks at @entity8 ’ s early struggles under the @entity68 as almost being in a different season and few who witnessed them will find that difficult to relate to			1
but , asked if — in the dark moments of autumn — he privately harboured doubts about the man he championed , @entity9 was unambiguous			1
the @entity68 manager looks on during @entity8 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity103 on wednesday despite the defeat , the @entity118 are six points clear at the top of the @entity123 table ‘ we ’re paid for these judgment calls and there was never any question of knee - jerk reactions to a bad result , or a bad couple of results , ’ he insisted			1
‘ genuinely , when @entity5 came in , we understood where he was strong and where he was weak ; he was weak in terms of experience			1
‘ nothing prepares you for @entity8 , as a manager or even a player coming here			1
we knew there would be a transitional period			2
we knew it would be a baptism of fire			2
the @entity146 was right on us			2
‘ but when we appointed him , we assessed that risk , and felt for the long - term good of the club it was the right thing to do			2
he will create a team , he will create players			0
‘ we ca n’t afford or can get into the market for @entity146 players so we need someone who creates @entity146 players , and that is what he does			0
he is a developer of players and that takes time			0
‘ he is a highly intelligent guy ; he is a progressive coach and , through time , it will prove that we were right			0
we feel we are making progress ; we have won nothing , yet			0
but hopefully in the short and longer term , he will create a fantastic team for @entity8			1
’ the first opportunity for a tangible sign of that progress comes in the form of the @entity173 with @entity174 at @entity175 on sunday week			0
in terms of a turning point for a season that at one point threatened to implode , @entity9 feels the injury - time win with 10 men at @entity182 in early november — followed by the @entity183 at its most ferocious — was it			1
@entity5 trains with his players , with @entity9 insisting the former @entity58 boss ' creates ' a team @entity5 shares a laugh with @entity190 loanee @entity189 ( left ) during a training session ‘ i think that was a change , yes , ’ @entity9 reflected			1
that helped change the fans ’ perception of him in terms of his emotion that day			0
’ ultimately , @entity5 ’s appointment was sanctioned by the board but it was the chief executive who first put his neck on the line for him			1
‘ my job is to recommend , and the board and @entity207 ( @entity208 ) backed that , ’ he explained			0
‘ it is the same with any manager			0
‘ you get paid to make judgment calls			0
some are right , some are wrong			0
this was the big one			1
it is the normal pressure for the job i am in			0
‘ we have a strong relationship			0
i have been here long enough			0
i have supported @entity8 all my life			1
i know the west of @entity223 , i know @entity224 and , hopefully , i know a bit about @entity223 football			0
‘ so i think that was a help to him			0
no matter who it is , nothing prepares you for the intensity of this job			0
you guys ( in the media ) know the intensity of it , the scrutiny of it			0
he is a young guy , but he is a quick learner			0
with a tail wind and a bit of luck , he can be a great manager			0
‘ his personality is beginning to come out			0
he has all the attributes and qualities to be a great manager			0
all you need is a bit of luck and be in the right time and the right place			0
’ @entity5 will get his first chance for silverware when @entity8 face @entity174 in the @entity173 final @entity9 has given @entity258 for results and 10/10 for showing progress in his debut season the destination of the season ’s major prizes may yet be unknown but @entity9 isn ’ t of a mind to hide @entity5 ’s light under a bushel			1
asked to rate his success to date in terms of a mark out of 10 , @entity9 replied : ‘ in terms of results , eight			1
in term of coming in and acclimatising and showing progress , 10			0
‘ he has become more relaxed , more confident			0
he is fitting in to the environment here and outside , which again is a big change for him			1
the players are buying into him			0
the players are with him , you can see that with the team			0
that is giving him the confidence to push on			0
