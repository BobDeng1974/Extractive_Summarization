on his way : @entity7 won the match in straight sets against the 26 - year - old @entity3 to reach the third round stretching : the second seed was made to work hard , and saw his serve broken in the second and third sets good contest : it was a clash of styles but @entity7 was just too good after @entity2 had made him work power : the @entity3 fired down serves of up to 147mph during the match , but it was n't enough all smiles : @entity7 salutes the crowd after his victory as the men 's top seeds continue to their fine start next up : @entity47 , who beat @entity48 on friday , will be @entity7 's third round opponent he added : ‘ you can often tell when they ’re really going to crank it up			1
