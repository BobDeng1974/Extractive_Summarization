@entity1 's executive vice-chairman @entity0 was caught on camera apparently swearing in frustration as his side struggled to a draw against @entity6			1
@entity8 's rant was filmed after @entity6 defender @entity9 hit a shot over the bar with the visitors 2 - 1 down at @entity13			2
the @entity1 chief was sat next to sir @entity15 in the stands and , as @entity17 took the resulting goal kick , @entity0 appeared to swear			1
@entity44 's late equaliser secured a 2 - 2 draw and will have lifted @entity0 's mood , but the @entity1 chief is likely to feel his expensively assembled team should have won the game			1
manager @entity19 shared his boss ' frustration , claiming his had been the better team and deserved all three points			1
' it is two points lost , ' said a clearly frustrated @entity56			0
' i think we were the better team			0
i am very disappointed about the result			0
' i do n't think @entity6 has created many chances , i think zero , and we gave the two goals away			2
' we have created four chances in the first half and seven in the second half			0
i am happy about our playing style but not happy with the result			0
' like our @entity1 facebook page			0
@entity0 would have been relieved when @entity44 equalised for @entity1 three minutes from time @entity19 insisted that his team were unlucky not to take all three points despite creating chances @entity73 not happy after two lost points			1

@entity0 appears to be swearing *angrily* as @entity1 struggled
@entity19 's team eventually *rescued* a point at @entity6
but before @entity44 's equaliser @entity0 clearly showed frustration
@entity19 is *adamant* that @entity1 can still catch @entity83
