in the future , many predict technology will be more intelligent and more living than most people can imagine today			2
but an expert has warned we need clear guidelines on how to implement and use technology , or else citizens will lose their rights to their identity and their life			1
he says there is a solution , though , which involves putting the public back in control of their own data - rather than leaving it to big corporations			1
@entity22 expert dr @entity21 from the @entity23 has warned of the rise of technology			1
companies like @entity27 and @entity28 have too much of our data , he said			1
and if we do n't control our own data we could lose our identities ( stock image shown ) the prediction was made by @entity36 professor dr @entity21 , an expert in artificial life from the @entity38 , in a new international book about the future of technology			1
it is already happening every day , he said : @entity43 , intelligence services , @entity27 , @entity28 and smartphones collect detailed data about everything in our lives			1
' one may think it is harmless if @entity27 knows that i drink too much or have sexual relations outside my marriage , or that i love strawberry jam , ' he said			1
@entity27 is developing artificial intelligence software to help users decide what they should and should n't upload to the social network			1
the software could even warn users if someone else uploads a snap of them , @entity27 has revealed			1
it hopes the software will ' mediate ' users interactions with their friends			0
' imagine that you had an intelligent digital assistant which would mediate your interaction with your friends and also with content on @entity27 , ' the head of the @entity66 , @entity65 , told @entity72			1
his project hopes to analyse everything uploaded to the social network , from video to pictures			0
but he said that giving large organisations and governments access to such data could be dangerous			1
' one may also think that authorities only look in our data if there is reason to suspect a crime			2
' historically , we know that democratic governments can be taken over by dictatorships			1
remember that democratic elections put the @entity91 in the @entity92			1
' a dictatorship has a completely different approach to control or punishment			2
in such a state data could be used to persecute citizens rather than to protect and serve them			2
he added : ' i believe the problem will escalate dramatically in the near future , if citizens do not protest			0
' the technology is complicated and has developed explosively in the last generation , which means that neither our decision makers nor our media understand what is going on - and more importantly , they can not imagine how technology could be used differently			2
' ' one may think it is harmless if @entity27 knows that i drink too much or have sexual relations outside my marriage , or that i love strawberry jam , ' he said			1
but dr @entity21 said that giving large organisations and governments access to such data , such as through our phones ( stock image shown ) , could be dangerous dr @entity21 points out that there are good technological possibilities to solve the problem			1
' we could , for instance , modify our digital infrastructure , so it is the individual citizens and not the state or the big companies that own our data			1
' in the book ' @entity136 from an @entity137 ' , an international group of researchers and writers worked together to give an insight into how the world might look like in 2070			0
professor @entity21 is scientific consultant on a story by @entity142			2
the story is about a little boy , his parents and his @entity145 , an advanced 3d printer - that can print almost everything that the little boy could wish for			0
but behind the boy 's innocent play , the reader gets a glimpse of a monitored society where it is not the boy and his parents who have control over the pm			2
instead , other powers have patented the technology in the boy 's pm , and hence there is no free and democratic access to or use of the technology			0
instead the boy 's playing is guided by hidden controllers with their own agenda			0
dr @entity21 also warned that in future artificial intelligence may be ' controlled ' by larger organisations or governments , preventing us from having our own true experiences ( stock image shown ) our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self - driving vehicles could bring about our demise			1
professor @entity179 has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			2
speaking at an event in @entity187 , the physicist told the @entity188 that : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			0
' this echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating @entity22 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			2
' he argues that developments in digital personal assistants @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 are merely symptoms of an it arms race which ' pale against what the coming decades will bring			0
' ' i 'd rather not be a part of such a society			0
i do not want international monopolies , a government or other authority to collect my data and prevent me from sharing my ideas and what i create and produce , with whom i want , ' said dr @entity21			1
' my data , my opinions , my ideas and what i make must belong to me			0
the individual citizen 's data must be protected from abuse			0
' according to dr @entity21 , there are no miracle cures , but there are better technical solutions than the ones we have today			1
these solutions require a restructuring of our digital infrastructure - first of all , different degrees of encryption of our private data are needed so that only the individual citizen can see everything			0
' we need laws that ban @entity27 , @entity28 and others from storing data about us unless we allow them to			1
' as these services often need to make money , we could pay a small amount every month for their services			0
' in this way they earn money from us directly and not from spying on us and selling our data			0
' recently others such as @entity179 have warned of the rise of technology			1
he said that warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself			2
speaking at an event in @entity187 , he told the @entity188 : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race ' he continued : ' also it is not good that we can readily be identified on the @entity264			0
it should be possible to conduct online transactions without our whole identity following the transaction			0
' in principle it should only be possible for companies or authorities to access our identity in the context of digital transactions if there is a legal basis for it			0
' this must however be weighed up against the possibility of giving criminals easier play on the @entity264			0
there are great business opportunities for truly democratic countries to develop the first democratic digital infrastructure			0
citizens in the rest of the world would of course want to buy such an infrastructure afterwards			0
dr @entity21 called for an understanding that things are not acceptable , as they are today			1
and he would like decision - makers and media to ' wake up ' and understand that digital technology allows for much better solutions than we have today			0
solutions that put the citizen in the center - not the state or large multinational companies , he said .			2

@entity22 expert dr @entity21 from the @entity23 has warned of the rise of technology
companies like @entity27 and @entity28 have too much of our data , he said
and if we do n't control our own data we could lose our identities
@entity316 governments should not be trusted with our data either , he said , because they can lead to dictatorships
' @entity316 elections put the @entity91 in the @entity92 @entity92 , ' he said
