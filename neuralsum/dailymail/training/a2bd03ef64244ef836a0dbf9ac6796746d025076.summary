by @entity0 last updated at 9:46 am on 31st december 2011 an hiv - positive man has potentially infected thousands of people - by having unprotected sex so he could spread the disease			2
@entity5 , 51 , turned himself in to a @entity7 police station last week - after claiming to have slept with 3,000 men and women over several years			1
a detective investigating the case said : ' he says he intentionally attempted to spread the disease to kill people			0
' his latest fantasy is strangling a woman and having sex with her dead body			0
while he claims that there may be thousands of victims , so far he has only been arraigned and charged with two counts of aids - sexual penetration with an uninformed partner			1
neither of the two victims that police are aware of have been identified , but one has spoken to reporters in an effort to help other women realize if they may be infected			2
she said that once she was tested , she immediately knew it was @entity5 who infected her			1
the two met through a @entity45 listing and , in speaking with @entity46 , she called him a ' sociopath ' and ' a predator '			1
strange : @entity5 's @entity51 profile has several odd pictures of him , like this one with a bunny and an angel statuette @entity5 works in telecommunications - previously at @entity56 and now at @entity57 , a healthcare provider			1
though the scope of his destructive path is still unknown , that woman said that she and @entity5 got together in 2008			1
she claims he texted her as he was headed to the police station , saying ' turning myself into the law , my life is over			0
she was not fooled by the niceties , however			0
' it 's something he should have done years ago , ' she told @entity46			0
' he should n't get a pat on the head for what he did			0
' in her previous conversations with @entity5 , he lead her to believe that he had a vast sexual past , claiming that he had had sex with up to 3,000 people , including men and women			1
he hits people who are young			0
he hits young women , and from what i understand , he hits men , too			2
' deadly strain : the hiv virus leads to @entity90 , and can easily be transferred from person to person during unprotected sex if one partner is infected according to his @entity51 profile , @entity5 graduated from @entity97 high school in @entity98 , @entity7 in 1978			1
he then went on to study at the online for - profit @entity100			2
his frequent and positive posts about the successes of his band do not reflect the supposed inner turmoil that he was going through			0
he was court - appointed to a mental health facility because of recent suicide attempts , and their records allege that he is ' sexually aroused by causing pain to females			0
in @entity7 , sexual penetration with @entity22 is considered a felony and he will be tried accordingly			1
