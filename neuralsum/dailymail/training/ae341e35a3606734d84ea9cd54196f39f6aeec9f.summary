by @entity0 , @entity1 the father of kidnapped @entity3 has spoken for the first time since his daughter mysteriously returned home and said , ‘ i ’m desperate for answers			1
i ’m as much in the dark as anyone else ’			2
@entity9 is overjoyed that @entity3 is finally back with her mother , unharmed , nine months after she disappeared on her way home from school			1
but he says he is as baffled as everyone else about the way she suddenly went missing , days before her 15th birthday and then suddenly came home			1
despite arresting @entity37 and charging him with kidnapping , the attorney general ’s office has released very little information about the crime			2
and mr @entity9 , who is divorced from @entity20 ’s mother @entity41 , says he has barely been told anything about his daughter ’s abduction			1
speaking on friday the 61 - year - old said he had seen her briefly once , but he did not want to push her on where she had been , or what had happened to her			1
‘ all i can say is i am so happy and relieved @entity20 is back home ’ , he said talking to @entity48			1
‘ i honestly never thought i was going to see her again			2
' i believe it is a miracle that she has come home unharmed			2
it could have been so much worse			2
it is an answer to all my prayers			0
’ he went on : ‘ i 'm in the dark as much as anyone , i am looking for answers like everyone else			0
with a cherry on top : @entity9 reached out to his daughter after she disappeared to tell her how worried he was that she was cold and did n't have a jacket and that she may not have enough food @entity68 : ' we have to be very careful as we really have no idea what happened to her , ' says @entity20 's dad ‘ i 'm her father , i want to know what happened more than anyone , i 'm desperate for answers			1
how do you think i feel ? it 's terrible that i do n't know what happened to my own daughter			1
‘ you would have thought i would be kept informed , but i have n't been			2
i have talked to the police , but they do n't know			1
‘ even if @entity20 lived here and even if i had custody the police still would n't be able to tell me anything because it 's an open investigation			1
’ he has seen @entity20 once since july 20 , but he says that meeting did not shed any light on the past nine months			1
‘ the short time i spent with @entity20 , well , you can tell when not to push someone ’ , he said			1
‘ i hope she will let me know what happened when she is ready			2
‘ we have to be very careful as we really have no idea what happened to her			2
we do n't know if she was hurt			1
she could just be putting on a brave act			1
we do n't know how she is feeling inside			2
’ @entity20 spoke to the media in person for the first time last week when she visited the offices of the newspaper , the @entity22 , to express her thanks for their commitment to the case			1

face of evil ? the 34 - year - old @entity37 was arraigned last week on charges he kidnapped 15 - year - old @entity3 last october he splits his time between @entity1 and @entity122 , but says he is as involved in his daughters ’ lives as possible			0
when @entity3 was missing he wrote a number of open letters on a public @entity31 page in a desperate attempt to get her to come home			1
the first , written in november , started : ‘ we do n't know if you ran away but if you did , it 's important for you to know sweetheart that nobody is angry with you , and you are not and will not be in any trouble			1
i just need to know that you are ok			0
‘ i am very worried that you are out there in the cold , because i do n't know if you have a jacket			2
i am also worried that you may not be eating			0
i am hoping and praying that you are safe , warm , and that you are eating			0
’ in a later note , penned six months after @entity3 ’s disappearance , he seemed to have changed his opinion and said he believed @entity141 had run away from home			2
this was partly based on the fact she had sent her parents a letter soon after her disappearance			0
its content has never been revealed			0
search : the @entity153 k - 9 officers walked along the @entity154 in @entity155 looking for clues mr @entity9 offered to take custody of his daughter and wrote : ‘ @entity20 it ’s important that you understand my reason for wanting custody			1
since a letter was received from you it became obvious that you ran away			0
and that raises the question what did you run away from ? only you can answer that but i am guessing that you ran away from your home life			2
’ explaining the letters he said : ‘ if you read them in full , they sum up how i feel			0
’ he added : ‘ i do n’t understand how she wrote the letter she did			0

he also has a lengthy criminal record , for offenses including , theft and criminal trespass , dating back to when he was just 17			0
