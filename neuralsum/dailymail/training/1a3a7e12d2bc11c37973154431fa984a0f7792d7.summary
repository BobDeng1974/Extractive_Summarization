@entity0 has sent its @entity2 smart eyewear back to the drawing board , while @entity4 is adament that the wrist is the right place for a wearable computer - but it appears @entity8 did n't get the message			1
the firm today released it 's take on @entity2 - a set of thick , black glasses complete with a black control cable			2
the developer version is available for $ 840 - far less than the $ 1500 @entity0 charged for its ill fated @entity16 edition			1
last month @entity0 announced it was killing off the current version of its @entity2 headset			1
it did n't abandon the project entirely though , and promised to develop a range of smart glasses under a different guise			1
now , sources claim @entity2 ' new boss @entity27 wants to redesign the headset from ' scratch ' and wo n't release it until ' it 's perfect '			2
@entity8 says they uses ' holographic wavelength technology ' , to superimpose information onto the wearer 's field of view — ' without any half mirrors that may obstruct the user 's vision , ' the company boasted			1
it also comes with a built - in 3 - megapixel cmos image sensor , accelerometer , gyro , electronic compass , and brightness sensor , behind the 3 - millimeter lenses			2
' imagine true augmented reality , ' @entity8 boasts			1
' imagine a world of knowledge in front of your eyes			0
imagine never not knowing , always having your hands free			0
' the @entity55 transparent - lens headset will go on sale in eight more countries — @entity65 , the @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 — next month			1
@entity8 hopes app developers will create hundreds of apps for it			1
' developers can combine the @entity53 sensors and camera with the powerful features of the smartphone to create unique hands - free use cases			1
' whether you ’re watching a live game , concert , touring a new city or carrying out a job , @entity53 helps you stay focussed and involved , whilst supporting and empowering you with extra data , help and information			0
' in an email to @entity84 , a @entity8 spokesperson said they chose to release the developer 's version now because ' as a hands - free device , @entity53 can be a promising product with many practical uses			1
' ' but since we recognize the need to explore applications at this stage , we 're releasing this developer edition , ' the spokesperson said			1
developers can access the official version of the @entity96 today			1
a separate ( but wired ) circular controller that clips onto your jacket or shirt collar houses the battery , speaker , microphone , @entity102 , and touch sensor			0
a separate ( but wired ) circular controller that clips onto your jacket or shirt collar houses the battery , speaker , microphone , @entity102 , and touch sensor			0
early application concepts include a step - by - step guide on how to assemble an engine , scrolling in front of the mechanic 's eyes as they work			0
@entity8 also suggested an app to share player stats while watching a sports game , or to display sightseeing information while visiting a tourist attraction			1
early developers will have access to a handful of @entity53 apps — available in the @entity129 store — which enable access to @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , calendar , and voice control			1
@entity8 hopes to release its @entity53 headset to consumers sometime next year			1
@entity0 dubbed the first set of several thousand @entity2 users as ' explorers			2
' but as the @entity141 hit the streets , they drew stares and jokes			0
some people viewed the device , capable of surreptitious video recording , as an obnoxious privacy intrusion , deriding the once - proud explorers as ' @entity151			0
' ' it looks super nerdy , ' said @entity153 , a @entity154 - based consultant , whose @entity2 now gathers dust in a drawer			0
' i 'm a card carrying nerd , but this was one card too many			0
' @entity2 now sells on @entity161 for as little as half list price			0
@entity0 told the @entity163 it will focus on ' future versions of @entity2 '			2
the @entity166 programme , gave software developers the chance to buy @entity2 for $ 1,500 ( £ 990 ) , and was launched in the @entity58 in 2013 , and the @entity169 last summer			1
from next week , the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using @entity2			0
the firm had already been thought to be developing a new version with chips made by @entity177 to go on sale later this year			2
the glass team is also expected to now move out of the @entity180 which engages in ' blue sky ' research , and become a separate undertaking , under its current manager @entity184			0
after an initial burst of enthusiasm , signs that consumers are giving up on @entity2 have been @entity189 developers recently have felt unsupported by investorsand , at times , @entity0 itself			1
she and the @entity2 team will report to @entity27 , the chief executive of the home automation business nest , acquired by @entity0 a year ago , the @entity163 says			2
he said the project had ' broken ground and allowed us to learn what 's important to consumers and enterprises alike ' and he was excited to be working with the team ' to integrate those learnings into future products '			0
@entity0 says it is committed to working on the future of the product , but gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product			2
' it ’s hard to believe that @entity2 started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop , ' the @entity2 team said in a post on @entity213			0
' we kept on it , and when it started to come together , we began the @entity217 as a kind of “ open beta ” to hear what people had to say			0
' ' @entity2 was in its infancy , and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk			0
' well , we still have some work to do , but now we ’re ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run			0

@entity8 developer version is available for $ 840
@entity65 giant hopes developers will create apps for the smart glasses
costs far less than the $ 1500 @entity0 charged for @entity166 edition
