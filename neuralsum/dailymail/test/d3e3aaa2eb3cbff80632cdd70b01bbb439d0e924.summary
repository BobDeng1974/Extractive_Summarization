@entity0 warned last night that lives will be in danger if @entity3 is saddled with a hung @entity4 unable to pass anti-terror laws			1
the home secretary said new legislation was urgently needed to update the powers of @entity9 and @entity10 , and repair the damage done by the @entity13 traitor @entity14			1
but , based on current polling , @entity4 would be left deadlocked – with the balance of power held by @entity18 nationalists opposed to updating the law			1
home secretary @entity0 ( pictured ) warned that lives will be in danger if @entity3 is saddled with a hung @entity4 unable to pass anti-terror laws - adding new legislation for @entity9 and @entity10 is urgently needed she urged wavering @entity25 supporters and the four in ten voters who say they are still undecided to realise what is at stake for @entity3 ’s security on may 7			1
the situation is made especially acute by a ‘ poison pill ’ inserted into emergency anti-terror laws passed last year			1
the legislation lapses next year			2
and if @entity35 can not agree on a replacement , @entity3 ’s spies will be unable to properly track the communications of @entity38 and other terrorists			1
mrs may said that , in the worst scenario , the decision would be in the hands of a minority @entity45 government propped up by the @entity46 – which is opposed to new data retention powers , her comments follow a controversial warning by defence secretary @entity51 that @entity52 might be unable to renew the @entity54 nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on @entity55 ’s @entity46 – as the polls say is highly likely			1
defence secretary @entity51 ( pictured ) said @entity52 might be unable to renew the @entity54 nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on @entity55 ’s @entity46 mr @entity51 said that , having stabbed his brother in the back to get the @entity52 leadership , mr @entity45 may now do the same to his country over national security			1
however mrs may insists that she is not using counter-terrorism as a ‘ political football ’ and the threat is real			2
she told the @entity65 : ‘ it is a matter of very real concern to me			0
there is a concern where we have a hung @entity4 where it is difficult to get legislation through or a @entity52 government that is propped up by the @entity46			1
‘ decisions will need to be taken about the capabilities we need and the one party that is committed to ensuring the security agencies and law enforcement have the powers that we need is the conservative party			2
’ mrs may delivered her warning in an exclusive interview with the @entity65 during a tour of marginal seats in the @entity87 and the @entity88			0
in a question and answer session with sixth formers in @entity92 , she was asked by a student what her opinion was of @entity14 – who leaked millions of documents exposing sensitive spying techniques			0
in her most forthright comments yet , mrs may replied : ‘ as a result of what he has done , it has become more difficult for our security agencies to do the job they need to do to keep us safe			0
he has potentially put lives at risk			2
’ the anti-terror law due to expire next year is the @entity110 and @entity111 , passed as emergency legislation in 2014			1
it gives security officials access to a treasure trove of communications data collected and stored by mobile phone and internet companies			0
this includes information on who you call , when , for how long and roughly where you were at the time			0
it is used for checking alibis , tracing kidnap victims and – in the case of terrorists – identifying and tracking plots			0
security agencies say that without it , fanatics will be far harder to monitor and lives will be in danger			2
in the wake of the @entity14 controversy , some technology firms have been reluctant to help the security services			0
officials say the leaks by @entity14 , made to the @entity140 , have been a gift for terrorists			0
despite the threat posed by jihadis returning from @entity146 , security has so far played no significant role in the election campaign			0
mrs may will hope her intervention sharpens minds with less than a week to go .			0
