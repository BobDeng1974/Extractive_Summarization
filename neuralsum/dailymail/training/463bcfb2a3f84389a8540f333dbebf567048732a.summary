by @entity0 published : 21:42 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 22:53 est , 17 february 2013 in 1967 , a 13 - year - old @entity2 boy sent his mother a postcard			1
this past feb. 15 , that postcard suddenly decided to arrive			1
forty - six years ago , @entity6 went on a family trip to the east coast to buy trucks and equipment for the family ’s concrete business			1
@entity13 : 46 years after he sent it , @entity6 's postcard to his mom mysteriously arrived along the way , it seems the family visited the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
‘ it was an awesome trip , ’ @entity6 recalled to @entity2 ’s @entity22			1
like any 13 - year - old , @entity6 wanted to let his mother know what a great time he and his father and cousins were having			2
we 've been having a great time , ’ @entity6 read aloud to a news crew while examining the perplexing postcard			2
unlikely story : ' this is one in a billion ' says a now grown up @entity6 , who sent the card from @entity36			2
in 1967 tattered and yellowed , @entity6 ’s curlicue cursive is still legible and a picture of a country store and a pot belly stove are clearly visible on the reverse			2
a 1967 postmark and @entity44 stamp carrying the price of four cents are also perfectly preserved			0
wherever the postcard was all those years , it was protected from damaging elements			0
still legible : @entity6 's cursive can still be read and the @entity44 four cent stamp and @entity52 postmark from 1967 are still quite clear however , no one has a clue where the place was			1
‘ under a piece of machinery ? i do n't know , ’ @entity6 wondered			0
but how the card suddenly went from lost to history to delivered like an everyday bill is a mystery			0
unsolved : no one in the family knows how or why the card finally showed up , delivered as if it was an everyday parcel ‘ i have no idea , ’ @entity6 mused , shaking his head			1
all those years ago , @entity6 addressed his childhood shoutout mom to the family business post office box			1
miraculously , the family still uses that same @entity52 box today and that , of course , is where the mystery card ended up			0
@entity6 ’s sister , @entity74 , said it was a company employee who first picked up the parcel			0
‘ this ca n’t be , ’ was the shocked secretary ’s response , @entity78 said			0
so what was @entity6 ’s mom ’s response to her son ’s suddenly surfacing card ? ‘ she was n’t really surprised that @entity87 had written her a card , ’ @entity78 said , smiling , ‘ but she was very surprised that it took years to get here			1
’ as for cool - headed @entity6 , he seemed to think such freak occurrences are bound to happen to someone			0
‘ sure this is one in a billion , ’ he said , ‘ mine just happened to be one of them			0
’ @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0

@entity6 's *memento* , sent during a trip to the east coast , took 46 years to travel from @entity21 to the family 's town of @entity107 , @entity2
the family has no clue how or why the postcard suddenly showed up after nearly half a century
