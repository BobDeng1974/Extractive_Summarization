parents have been warned that allowing their children to miss just a week of school can cut their chances of succeeding by up to a quarter			0
education secretary @entity4 today released research showing the dramatic affect just a few days absence can have on attainment			1
she claimed it ‘ busts the myth ’ that term - time holidays are harmless and vindicates headteachers who take a hardline stance with parents who break the rules			1
figures for 2012 - 13 show the impact of missing just 14 days on pupils ' ability to gain good gcse results the coalition changed the law so that headteachers can only grant leave from school in exceptional circumstances			1
but many parents have complained that the cost of package holidays is so much cheaper during term - time that they have no choice but to take their children out of school			1
however , the @entity32 today released data which it claims shows how as little as a week off each year can put pupils behind those who miss no school			1
it examined how many pupils achieved the @entity39 , which includes a gcse at @entity41 or above in @entity42 , maths , history or geography , the sciences and a language			1
some 44 per cent of pupils who missed no lessons achieved the so - called ‘ gold standard ’ of qualifications			1
but this fell to only 31.7 per cent of those who missed 14 days over two years of studying for their gcses , equivalent of around one week per year			1
among those who missed 28 days over two years , just 16.4 per cent achieved the @entity39 standard			1
education secretary @entity4 said the research busts the myth ’ that term - time holidays are harmless and vindicates headteachers who take a hardline stance with parents who break the rules as a result of the crackdown on term - time absences imposed by former education secretary @entity69 in september 2013 , headteachers can no longer grant up to 10 days ’ holiday a year			1
instead , they can allow leave only in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ each parent who ignores a ban faces a £ 60 fine per child , rising to £ 120 if it is not paid within 21 days			2
failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution , with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £ 2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months			0
the move was intended to stop families damaging their children ’s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays			2
a quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans			0
at primary school , pupils who misses 14 days at age 11 were a quarter less likely to achieve level 5 or above in reading , writing or maths tests than those with no absence			1
mrs @entity100 said : ‘ the myth that pulling a child out of school for a holiday is harmless to their education has been busted by this research			1
today heads across the country have been vindicated - missing school can have a lasting effect on a pupil ’s life chances			2
’ under the new rules , each parent who ignores a ban faces a £ 60 fine per child , rising to £ 120 if it is not paid within 21 days			0
