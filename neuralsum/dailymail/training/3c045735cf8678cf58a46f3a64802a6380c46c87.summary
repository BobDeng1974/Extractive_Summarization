’ looking for a cheaper alternative to @entity9 ? here are some of the @entity73 's favourite proseccos : @entity74 , £ 15 a pretty , pale gold wine with excellent effervescence providing lots of movement on the palate			1
floral - scented , with a hint of elderflower in the flavour			2
verdict : a luxurious wine that looked and tasted superior to many of the others			2
at the same price as cheap @entity88 , this is more than a match for its @entity21 rival			2
@entity92 , £ 6.99 a pale coloured wine , lacking the subtle sunshine tint typical in a prosecco			0
did n’t bubble as pleasingly as some of the others but the warm , toasty flavours of this sweeter wine were delightful			0
verdict : great - looking rustic bottle and enough character to want to pour another glass			0
best for everyday @entity105 dinners			0
@entity106 ( @entity107 ) , £ 7.29 a pleasant straw colour , with a slight earthy scent and light , sweet citrus flavours			0
but it lacks the classic flowery tones that would have given the wine more character			0
verdict : good value , but the flavours are a little too faint			0
majestic wine — @entity119 , £ 11.99 the most vigorous fizzer of all , with fast - moving bubbles that prickled on the palate			0
the flavour is not that of a classic prosecco — more like a rounded , dry white wine			0
verdict : all the vitality and quality you need in a party wine			0
best when you want to impress			0
