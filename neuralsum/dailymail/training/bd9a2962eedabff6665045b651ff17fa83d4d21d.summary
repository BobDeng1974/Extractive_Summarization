and one hen owner had a particularly uplifting morning when her eggs came funny side up			2
@entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , reached into the chicken coop in her garden to find a smiley - faced shell grinning back at her			2
yolk joke : the bizarre markings on five - year - old @entity19 the hen 's feelgood egg , which her owner found in the chicken coop in her @entity13 garden she had noticed her five - year - old hen @entity19 laying a number of strange - looking eggs as she grew older , but this unusual one took her breath away			1
the 56 - year - old raced inside to show husband @entity30 the big , happy egg , which measured 3ins by 1.5ins			1
mrs @entity11 , a dog breeder , then cracked it open and made an extra-satisfying omelette			1
she believes the appearance of the cheery looking shell was down to the hen 's advanced years - as well as her comfortable free - range lifestyle			0
' i went to collect the eggs as normal and saw one huge egg , ' said mrs @entity11			1
cracking comedy : @entity11 's prize chicken really made her morning with her entertaining egg ' when i looked closer i saw two shaded areas on the shell just like a pair of eyes and then a large curve which made it look like a smiley face			1
' @entity19 is five - years - old which is quite old , and that can often mean discoloured eggs or strange shapes			0
but she has never laid anything like this before			0
' it certainly made me smile and i like to think it was grinning because it was the biggest out of the lot and looks rather chuffed			0
' i could nâ€™t have kept it because it would have eventually gone off , so we decided to eat it			0

@entity11 made a cracking omelette from the happy egg
she says shells tend to be marked or discoloured if the hen is older
