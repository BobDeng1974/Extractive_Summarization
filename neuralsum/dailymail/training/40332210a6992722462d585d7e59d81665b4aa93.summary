by @entity0 published : 16:13 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 18:40 est , 8 september 2012 courts in some parts of the country jail barely one in two burglars while others send down as many as 90 per cent , a new ' leniency league table ' reveals today			1
the table , which is based on official @entity9 figures , shows an astonishing variation in how @entity11 deal with convicted burglars			1
it comes just days after judge @entity14 , sitting at @entity15 , sparked outrage by praising a housebreaker for his ' courage '			1
lenient : courts in some parts of the country jail barely one in two burglars but the table reveals that 30 courts across @entity25 and @entity26 were more lenient towards burglars than @entity15 in 2010			1
leniency league : tables are based on official @entity9 figures based on the number of burglars given immediate jail sentences , @entity30 in @entity31 was the most lenient court in the country with just under 58 per cent of the crimes ending in jail straight away			1
@entity39 was little better at just over 58 per cent , with the figure for @entity41 in @entity42 59 per cent			1
but in stark contrast , judges in @entity44 in @entity45 were the toughest in 2010 , handing down immediate jail sentences in more than 90 per cent of burglary cases			1
chichester in @entity49 was the second strictest @entity11 on housebreakers with an 88 per cent prison sentence rate			1
four other courts - in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 - handed out immediate jail sentences in more than 85 per cent of cases			1
last night , @entity59 mp @entity58 , who unearthed the figures through parliamentary questions , called on new justice secretary @entity62 to investigate			1
mr @entity58 said : ' what this table reveals is a map showing burglars the best places to get caught if they want to avoid being sent down			1
' i am astonished that one court jails nine out of ten while others are sending not much more than one in two burglars to their just deserts			1
' @entity75 mp mr @entity58 last week branded @entity76 ' an idiot ' after he gave burglar @entity78 , 26 , a suspended sentence after commenting about the amount of courage he believed it took to enter someone 's house			2
mr @entity58 said that he was particularly worried that 30 courts were more lenient than @entity15 in 2010			1
controversy : judge @entity14 , left , sparked outrage month when he praised burglar @entity78 's , right , ' courage ' for breaking into three homes tougher laws : @entity92 is @entity59 mp for @entity93 and an ex @entity95 colonel in 1999 , the @entity97 farmer @entity96 killed one of my constituents and injured another when they went to burgle his farm			2
quite rightly , mr @entity96 was prosecuted and served time in prison but the case became a cause celebre			2
last sunday , @entity105 and his wife @entity106 from @entity107 used a legally - held shotgun to defend themselves against a number of men who are alleged to have broken into their property			2
two of them were wounded and the @entity116 were held and questioned by police for more than two days before being released at the behest of the @entity119			2
now , the two cases are very different , but there is one important similarity â€“ the law does not protect householders from intrusion in the way i believe that it should			1
in 2004 , i initiated a @entity128 that would have solved the problem			2
after the @entity96 case , there had been a very important change in civil law			2
@entity134 , my constituent who had been wounded in the burglary , attempted to sue mr @entity96 for the injuries that he caused			2
as civil law then stood , he would have to prove that mr @entity96 had used ' unreasonable force '			2
very quickly , though , the government of the day amended civil law and raised the threshold using the phrase ' grossly disproportionate ' force			0
my @entity128 was designed to bring criminal law into step with civil law			0
@entity147 , the then @entity148 , drafted a simple amendment which would have the effect of giving ordinary householders the protection of the ' grossly disproportionate ' proviso			0
legal protection : @entity134 , right , attempted to sue @entity96 , left it seemed at one stage that the @entity157 had the support of @entity159 and the then @entity161 police commissioner			0
@entity134 even told my local newspaper that such a change in the law would deter him from breaking and entering in future			0
the whole issue was immensely popular			0
my @entity157 was scuppered by a disgraceful piece of chicanery from the @entity169			0
i was delighted , then , when the conservative manifesto in 2010 said : ' we will give householders greater legal protection if they have to defend themselves against intruders in their own homes			0
' such promises were not contained in the @entity177 although the @entity177 has tweaked the law a little further			0
but it 's cases such as that of the ferries that must cause decisive action to be taken now			1
this need can only be underlined by the extraordinary statement from judge @entity14 last week who apparently told an offender that ' it takes a huge amount of courage ... for somebody to burgle somebody 's house '			0
it is an astounding statement and the prime minister , absolutely properly , condemned it completely			0
but he also went on to say ' that 's why this government is changing the law to toughen the rules on self defence towards burglars '			1
really ? it 's two years later and yet we still do not have the ' grossly disproportionate ' phrase enshrined in criminal law			0
released : @entity105 and @entity206 were held for more than two days by police i do n't want householders to be given a licence to butcher intruders in their homes , but i do want normal people to feel that the law is unquestionably on their side and not on that of the criminals			0
i also want the police and the @entity119 to be confident about not putting people like the @entity116 through days of anguish when such anguish should be reserved for offenders			0
when they were in @entity224 , the @entity223 seemed very clear about what needed to be done			0
indeed , many of my @entity157 's greatest supporters are now in power			0
yet , something is stopping them from putting their earlier words into action			0
the government needs to listen , not just to decent people , but to burglars like @entity134 and change the law now			1
@entity92 is a @entity59 mp for @entity93 and ex @entity95 colonel			0

@entity9 figures show astonishing variation in how @entity11 deal with convicted burglars
@entity30 was the most lenient in the country with just under 58 per cent of the crimes ending in jail
@entity247 was the toughest , handing down immediate jail sentences in more than 90 per cent of cases
