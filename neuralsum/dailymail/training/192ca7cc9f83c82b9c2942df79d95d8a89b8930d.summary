previous @entity1 winners for the country have included the queen of soft ballads @entity5			2
but this year @entity6 is putting its faith in the @entity8 , whose guitarist is 94 - years - old , to win the contest			1
@entity6 television viewers chose the christian missionary group 's rock tune @entity15 from among five national finalists to represent the country late on saturday			1
viewers and juries pick the winner from an eclectic mix of bubblegum pop and rock acts representing each @entity30 country			1
and the @entity41 - made up of 94 year old @entity42 accompanied on lead guitar by 22 year old @entity44 , trombone player @entity45 , 47 , backing singer @entity46 , 46 , and lead singers @entity48 , 31 , and @entity49 , 20 - is certainly eclectic			1
but the band are already causing stir			2
political songs are forbidden and @entity6 media have speculated that the @entity8 's @entity55 aims might still fall foul of the rules			1
in an interview published on the @entity8 website @entity42 - who has been playing since he was 10 - describes himself as an ' old crock '			2
he said : ' i ’m an old crock , but otherwise fine – thanks to my dear wife ! we still live at home and even have a garden , there ’s still a lot i can do			2
' i ’m in the @entity8 @entity72 brass band now			2
i ’ve been making music with the @entity8 ever since i was ten , played with the @entity8 in @entity74 during the war , then spent 35 years conducting the band in @entity72			2
the @entity41 - made up of 94 year old @entity42 accompanied on lead guitar by 22 year old @entity44 , trombone player @entity45 , 47 , backing singer @entity46 , 46 , and lead singers @entity48 , 31 , and @entity49 , 20 - is certainly eclectic but the band are already causing a stir			1
political songs are forbidden by @entity1 and @entity6 media have speculated that the @entity8 's @entity55 aims might still fall foul of the rules ' someone asked me ( to join the band ) , and i was interested			1
i thought i ’d give it a try			0
i always liked making music , and got to play a lot of different instruments			0
and i like helping to make the @entity8 better known			0
but i was a bit worried it might not be the right thing for me – and the video shooting was a bit much ! ' we ’re all good friends – i always say that is the most important thing			0
playing music and doing something together puts you closer , in better contact with each other			0
' i want the @entity8 to be better known again			0
over the last few years you do n’t see us as much as you did when we used to sing in the pubs and restaurants , and all we can do mostly is just pass the collecting box around			0
so it ’s a wonderful idea to put the @entity8 in the public eye like @entity111 asked what he would do if they won the chance to represent @entity6 , he said : ' oooooh – then i ’ll have to go through with it , wo n’t i – but i ’ve done a lot of travelling , so it wo n’t be that bad			1
' so let ’s go to @entity27 ! why not , if i can still do it and i ’m fit enough ? ' @entity6 has n't won the contest since @entity121 singer @entity5 represented the country in 1988			1
@entity8 project manager @entity123 : ' everything started with what sounded like a crazy idea			0
but then we all got enthusiastic about it , and after managing to get @entity129 as producer , we clearly had to give it a try			0
' because even without winning , it would still be worth doing			0
' firstly to show that we love challenges , secondly to get a new song in our @entity137 repertoire			0
' video : not too old to rock : 94 - year - old @entity42 in action on ' @entity15 ' ...			1
