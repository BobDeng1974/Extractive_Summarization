by @entity0 even the mildest hayfever sufferers know how difficult it can be to keep track of changes in pollen levels			1
with this in mind , a design team has devised a prototype sensor that constantly monitors local pollen and air quality readings			1
the web - connected sensor constantly monitors local pollen and air quality levels and will report changes in levels to the app in addition to offering localised readings , the app can also warn users to take medication , or to avoid certain areas where their hayfever would be particularly bad			1
@entity19 consists of an external sensor that syncs with a smartphone app. this @entity36 - enabled sensor can be placed in a garden , or outside a house or office to constantly monitor local pollen and air quality levels			1
these readings are then combined with @entity44 pollen data and weather forecasts			0
the app uses a traffic light colour system to warn users about low , medium or high levels and asks them to record how they 're feeling			2
in addition to localised readings , the app can also warn users to take medication , or to avoid certain areas			2
called @entity54 , the prototype was created by @entity57 - based digital studio 383			0

the app uses a traffic light colour system to warn users about low , medium or high levels and asks them to record how they 're feeling ( pictured right ) the service also learns a user ’s personal hayfever triggers , such as which types of pollen affect them the most , and can send specific alerts about these triggers			2
@entity19 is a prototype ( watch concept pictured ) , designed to show what apps and sensors are capable of recording ' the daily pollen forecasts issued by the @entity44 paint the country with broad strokes either of high , medium or low scores , but it 's often specific locations or pollen types that cause the most irritating effects , ’ said the design team at 383			1

@entity19 is a prototype that consists of an external sensor and app
sensors are placed in a garden or outside a house or office building
it is connected to the web and monitors local pollen and air quality levels
changes are sent to the smartphone app to warn sufferers
push *notifications* can also be used to tell sufferers to take medication
