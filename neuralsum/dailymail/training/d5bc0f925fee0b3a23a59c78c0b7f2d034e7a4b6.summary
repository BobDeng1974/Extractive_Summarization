by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 18 june 2013 @entity1 , who introduced the 1967 @entity2 which legalised the practice , said it was ' thoroughly undesirable ' that 36 per cent of terminations are now to those who have already had at least abortion the father of the @entity9 has spoken out to warn of the growing ‘ problem ’ of women having repeat terminations as an alternative to contraception			1
@entity1 , who introduced the 1967 @entity2 which legalised the practice , said it was ‘ thoroughly undesirable ’ that 36 per cent of terminations are now to those who have already had at least one abortion			1
in a dramatic intervention , he said it was ‘ never the purpose ’ of his historic reform that tens of thousands of women would use abortion as a ‘ form of contraception ’			1
the indication that the former @entity28 leader , who brought forward his @entity29 when he was a young backbencher , now believes his legislation has gone too far seems set to reignite the debate over abortion			0
latest figures show that in 2011 , there were 189,931 abortions , of which no fewer than 68,105 were on women who had already had a foetus terminated - a proportion of 36 per cent			1
this compares to 64,303 repeat terminations the year before - a proportion of 34 per cent			0
repeat abortions cost the cash - strapped @entity43 almost £ 1million every single week			2
@entity1 made his comments in the @entity46 last week during a question - and - answer session on abortion with health minister @entity49			1
he asked the minister : ‘ will he confirm that there has been a welcome drop in the total number of abortions recently , but that there is still a problem of what are called repeat abortions , where women present who are clearly using abortion as a form of contraception , which is thoroughly undesirable ? ’ @entity49 replied : ‘ the abortion rate across @entity66 and @entity67 has been static since 2009			1
the good news is that the abortion rate for women under 18 has gone down			2
there was a 9.6 per cent decrease in the rate between 2010 and 2011			2
‘ on repeat abortions , the news is not so good			2
the proportion of repeat abortions for women who had abortions in 2011 was 36 per cent			1
the figure was higher than it had been the previous year , which is a matter for concern			0
’ latest figures show that in 2011 , there were 189,931 abortions , of which no fewer than 68,105 were on women who had already had a foetus terminated - a proportion of 36 per cent the 2011 figures on repeat abortions show that many women are going back time and time again for terminations - a sign , according to @entity1 , that they are being used as a form of contraception			1
some 17,241 women were on at least their third abortion ; 434 were on at least their sixth and - astoundingly - 76 were on at least their eighth			2
speaking later to the @entity96 , @entity1 said : ‘ it is odd that so many women present for repeat abortions , some more than twice , which does suggest they are treating abortion as contraception			1
‘ this was never the purpose of the 1967 reform			0
’ @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said : ‘ @entity1 needs to face the reality of the provision of abortion in this country , that it is not just being provided for women in dramatic need but is available on demand			1
‘ it was verging on the ingenuous of him to imagine when he brought forward his legislation in 1967 that abortion would n’t end up being available on demand			0
the 2011 figures on repeat abortions show that many women are going back time and time again for terminations - a sign , according to @entity1 , that they are being used as a form of contraception ‘ the trouble is that many people think there is nothing wrong with repeat abortions			1
they say : abortion is either right or wrong , so if you can have one you should be able to have as many as you can ask for			0
’ @entity131 , chief executive of abortion provider @entity132 , said : ‘ it is unfair to women and wrong for politicians to assume that women can live a modern life and not have the option of accessing abortion services			0
‘ too many politicians - particularly as they get older - forget that abortion is a part of life			0
‘ she said repeat terminations happen because ‘ women in their teens and their 20s are often very fertile and find it difficult to manage their fertility by contraception alone ’			0
‘ women are not using abortion simply as another method of birth control , ’ she said			0
‘ what is happening is that contraception fails , or sometimes we fail to use it properly			0
‘ when abortion is legal and easily available , it is not surprising if women use it - and that is not a bad thing			0

36 *%* of abortions are to those who have already had one *procedure*
@entity1 said it was ' thoroughly undesirable ' and ' never purpose ' of act
