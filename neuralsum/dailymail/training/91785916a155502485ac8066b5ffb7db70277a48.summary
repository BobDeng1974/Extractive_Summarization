watch out : the false widow spider came over from the @entity20 a hundred years ago mr @entity5 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , had been aware of several stings during the day and had assumed they had come from a bee			1
he was horrified to discover the bites had come from the false widow spider , which is closely related to the black widow spider			1
thankfully he suffered no further reaction and was given painkillers before being released the same day			2
the spider , whose body is bigger than a five pence coin , is thought to have dropped into mr @entity5 ’s hooded top from foliage growing close to mr @entity5 ’s home			1
he said : ' i had been stung earlier in the day but had assumed it was a bee and took some anti-histamine pills			2
