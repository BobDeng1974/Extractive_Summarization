click here to see more of our brilliant @entity1 , including @entity4 's opening goal an encounter that began in relative darkness left @entity7 in one of his darker moods on saturday			1
he might have seen his side strengthen their grip on this @entity13 title race with a second - half penalty from @entity15 but @entity17 ’s manager seemed far from satisfied when he eventually appeared for his post-match press conference			1
for a start , he accused the man in charge of the floodlights of being asleep , and he did have a point			0
@entity15 celebrates what turned out to be the winning goal in the west @entity27 encounter between @entity17 and @entity28 @entity29 jumps in the air after scoring his side 's equaliser in the 62nd minute @entity29 's @entity28 team - mates rush to celebrate with the striker as their side draw level with the @entity13 leaders @entity4 celebrates his goal after putting his side 1 - 0 up against west @entity27 rivals @entity28 @entity17 's @entity40 midfielder finished smartly passed @entity28 goalkeeper @entity41 just after half an hour @entity17 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity42 6.5 ; @entity43 7 , @entity44 7 , @entity45 7 , @entity46 6.5 ; @entity47 8 , @entity48 7.5 ; @entity49 7 ( @entity50 64 - 6 ) , @entity4 8.5 , @entity15 7.5 ( @entity51 90 ) ; @entity52 7 ( @entity53 78 - 6 ) subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity51 , @entity58 goals : @entity4 32 , @entity60 @entity28 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity41 7 ; @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 6 , @entity63 6.5 , @entity64 5.5 ; @entity65 7.5 , @entity66 7 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 7 ( @entity69 83 ) , @entity70 5.5 ( @entity71 60 - 6 ) ; @entity72 7.5 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 goal : @entity72 62 referee : @entity81 6 attendance : 41,468 ratings by @entity84 it was so gloomy @entity41 complained to the officials and when the lights did come on , 20 minutes into this absorbing contest , @entity28 ’s goalkeeper was more than vindicated given the difference they made			1
it was like someone had just opened the curtains			0
but @entity7 said it was another 10 minutes or so , with the arrival of a quite brilliant goal from @entity4 , before he realised ‘ the ground was not empty ’ and the point he was making was obvious			1
he was fighting against a sense of complacency that he clearly believes is spreading among the supporters , as well his players ; this sense that the victories will simply come because they are so much better than everyone else			0
he seemed to regard @entity29 ’s marvellous 62nd - minute equaliser as a product of that complacency , even if he did then praise his team for the manner in which they responded to take all three points			1
for the first half of this contest they were vastly superior to a @entity28 side who were only a single goal down because of the sheer defiance and determination of @entity41 and his colleagues in defence , in particular the courageous @entity122			2
@entity7 ( below ) would probably see criticism in any comparison with his first championship - winning @entity17 team but there were periods of this game , as there have been in other performances this season , when this side has looked like an improvement on its all - conquering predecessor			1
that first team was terrific			0
powerful , as well potent , sir @entity137 marvelled at their machine - like consumption of consecutive @entity13 titles			2
but there is something about this current crop of players that demands more attention , even if they are not delivering their best with the consistency their manager demands			0
they are certainly easier on the eye , while maintaining a ruthless quality that is enabling them to maintain this impressive unbeaten run			0
there is a nice blend of craft and hard graft , making them a real joy to watch			0
@entity4 opened the scoring in the 32nd minute after an impressive passing move by @entity17			1
click here to see more of our @entity1 the @entity40 attacking midfielder scored his fourth goal of the season against @entity170 's side @entity46 congratulated his fellow countryman and @entity17 team - mate after @entity4 scored past @entity28 goalkeeper @entity41 @entity170 greets his opposite number @entity7 before the encounter at @entity176 @entity48 now has as many assists this season as @entity179 managed during the whole of last season clearly , the acquisition of @entity48 has made an enormous difference , his poise , precision and vision giving them something in midfield @entity17 could not even claim to have had when @entity189 was driving them towards trophy after trophy			1
but it is not just @entity48			0
it is players with the flair and invention of @entity15 , @entity49 and @entity4 , as well as those with the power and strength of @entity52 and a brilliantly drilled back four			2
@entity4 ’s goal was a combination of both qualities			2
it might have been the finesse of @entity48 that saw the ball delivered into the path of @entity4 but it owed much to @entity52 ’s strength to hold the ball up for what was a terrific one - two between the @entity210			2
the finish that then followed from @entity4 in the 32nd minute was just extraordinary , the @entity40 using the outside of his right foot to curl the ball across the face of the @entity28 goal and beyond the reach of a diving @entity41 via the inside of the far post			1
the fact that @entity4 also had to squeeze the ball in front of @entity63 demanded even more precision			0
but it was the bend of the ball that was most staggering ; a shot that almost challenged the laws of physics			0
@entity28 's @entity65 brought down @entity17 playmaker hazard to concede a second half penalty @entity50 congratulates his @entity233 team - mate after winning the spot kick that would put @entity17 back in front @entity15 dispatched his side 's penalty after being brought down by @entity28 's @entity65 @entity28 custodian @entity41 dives to the right as @entity15 slots the ball to the left to send his side on the way to picking up the three points @entity41 and his @entity28 team - mates look distraught after conceding with 15 minutes on the clock hazard ( middle ) celebrates with his @entity17 team - mates after putting his side back in front against their @entity27 rivals it certainly had @entity251 on his feet and it is probably a reason why @entity7 talks of managing for another 20 years			1
why would you not want to keep working with players of this quality ? @entity259 miles @entity17 110.4 68.6 @entity48 90 12.1 7.5 @entity260 90 11.6 7.2 @entity46 90 11.0 6.8 @entity28 107.1 66.5 @entity66 90 12.6 7.8 @entity67 90 11.1 6.9 @entity261 90 10.3 6.5 @entity7 , nevertheless , still sees room for improvement			2
on saturday 's evidence , plenty			0
having seen his side leak a late equaliser to @entity266 last sunday , he was distinctly unimpressed to see a spirited @entity28 side battle their way back into this game			0
if @entity29 was once so in awe of @entity45 he asked to have his picture taken with @entity17 ’s captain , there were no signs of any enduring inferiority complex here			2
he produced a quite brilliant equaliser to add another chapter to the remarkable story of his rise from @entity282 to the @entity13 , diverting @entity68 ’s scuffed volley beyond the reach of @entity42 with a delightful heel - flick after the @entity17 goalkeeper had punched clear a cross from @entity65			1
the vigour of @entity17 ’s response did , however , please @entity7			2
they moved up through the gears again and when @entity15 burst into the @entity28 penalty area in the 75th minute , a reckless shoulder barge from @entity65 left referee @entity81 with little option but to point to the spot			1
@entity15 , so composed in such situations , comfortably converted , and @entity7 noted with some pleasure the fact that @entity41 then had to make another couple of decent saves			1
the @entity17 manager also praised opposite number @entity170 for his ‘ fantastic work ’ in the way he had ‘ organised his team defensively ’			0
such generosity did not extend to his players , though , even if the mark of a championship - winning team is the ability to secure victories when they fail to perform at their best			0
that said , there were also spells here on saturday when they were absolutely mesmerising			0
@entity17 players pause for a minute 's silence in respect for @entity320 @entity28 's starting line - up also observed the minute 's silence and had poppies printed on their shirts @entity17 right back @entity43 and @entity28 centre back @entity62 compete for the ball the @entity326 ace keeps a close eye on @entity261 during the first half of the west @entity27 derby @entity15 ( right ) goes down in the area under a challenge from @entity28 ' @entity40 midfielder @entity67 ( left ) a furious looking @entity52 exchanges words with @entity66 as @entity13 referee @entity81 looks on @entity17 's match winner hazard was replaced by @entity40 midfielder @entity51 during the closing stages of the match @entity28 chairman @entity338 watched his side take on @entity17 alongside former @entity340 like @entity342 's facebook page .			1

@entity17 attacking midfielder @entity15 scored his side 's winning goal in the 75th minute
@entity4 had opened the scoring before @entity29 equalised at @entity176
hazard was brought down by @entity65 before *stepping* up to score penalty past @entity41
@entity7 's side remain four points clear at the top of the @entity13
