@entity1 wineries are making the move away from the traditional wine regions and taking their business south of the @entity5 to @entity6			1
@entity7 is among the varieties increasingly being grown in the southern state , and @entity10 was one of the first to take the plunge , breaking away from his family 's well - known winery in the @entity15 region in @entity16			1
initially , mr @entity10 's family thought he was crazy trying to grow the grapes down south , which have their roots in the hot and dry @entity15 and are famous for their full flavours			2
@entity22 winemaker @entity10 made the move south to @entity6 to produce @entity25 wine , due to warmer temperatures in the @entity15 but with temperatures in @entity16 's main regions including the @entity29 and @entity30 on the up according to @entity31 , the young winemaker 's daring move may have paid off			1
they also report that a study by the @entity37 @entity36 discovered up to 73 per cent of @entity1 land currently used for viticulture could become unsuitable by 2050			0
mr @entity10 left the @entity15 in 2003 and travelled the world , making stops at vineyards in @entity43 and @entity44 , taking note on how the grapes were grown in cooler conditions			1
in 2008 he settled in @entity6 , and told the @entity48 he was ' searching for cooler climate regions , ' in part because conditions in the @entity15 were getting warmer			1
just years later he became the first person to ever win a prestigious national award , the @entity54 , for a @entity25 produced in @entity6			1
' having worked in the colder climates in @entity43 ... i understood how to grow these wines in cool climates			0
mr @entity10 left the family business in the @entity15 , and became the first to win a prestigious national award for a @entity25 his father still owns the family business , @entity63 , but mr @entity10 said ' i wanted to try and make different styles to what my family was doing			1
' ' they were a bit surprised ( initially ) , especially picking @entity6			0
there 's a lot of comments from other winemakers and my family comparing it ( @entity25 wine ) to light beer			2
' due to the cooler climate down south , @entity25 wines tend to be 15 - 20 percent less alcoholic than those grown in hotter climates			2
however with global warming , predictions are that some regions may become too hot for the vineyards to properly operate			0
@entity85 tends not to be grown in @entity6 , with the main variety produced being @entity87			0
however , ceo of @entity89 said it 's a trend that is increasing			0
' it 's fair to say we are seeing quite a lot of wine producers move to @entity6 ... the cooler the climate , within reason , the higher quality of wine			2
' ms @entity99 also said growing in cooler climates is ' high risk but it 's high reward ' , and over the past few years have seen big expansions from key wine producers in @entity6			0
@entity25 wine is less alcoholic and more sublet in flavour , but despite this the wine industry is booming the southern state as temperatures increase in other regions despite the prediction that rising temperatures on mainland @entity16 are going to have devastating effects on the wine industry , @entity113 , head of the @entity114 insisted even if this is the case , the change will not be immediate			1
' one of the things that people need to remember is if we 're going to move into a warmer drier world , it 's not going to be sudden			0
' mr @entity113 said the vineyards are adapting as the changes happen , and people need not take the risk and jump ship simply because of what he described as cycles of weather			0
when asked if they would make the move down south , @entity133 ( @entity134 ) , which own iconic wine brands @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 's among many others , said they are monitoring external conditions on their own			0
@entity134 also said they are working to ' develop technologies and management practices to deal with these changes in the vineyards , ' but as they already have roots down across @entity16 have no plans to move all production to one region			2
a study suggests that more than 70 percent of @entity16 's current wine regions may become unusable to 2050			1

@entity10 left his family 's business in the @entity15 region , @entity16 in 2003
in 2008 he opened up an *offshoot* business , @entity159 wines in @entity6
a new study suggests more than 70 percent of @entity16 's current wine regions may be unusable by 2050 due to climate change
he was the first person to win a prestigious award for a @entity25 wine
conditions heating up in mainland @entity1 vineyards are prompting people to move
