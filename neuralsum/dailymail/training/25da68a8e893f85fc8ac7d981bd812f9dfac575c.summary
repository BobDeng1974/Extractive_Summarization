@entity0 was drinking from a coconut and @entity2 was shuffling on the bench			1
it ’s hard to imagine either of them making the kind of mess of the game - changing chance that came @entity11 ’s way during the first half			1
he went through on goal at 0 - 0 and was caught between thoughts of passing to @entity16 or shooting			1
in that moment , he forgot his prime function in this team and also forgot how to pass			0
such is the lot of a striker without great confidence ; such is the frustration for a manager – you make a choice and be damned			0
@entity11 reacts after missing a golden chance to open the scoring for @entity29 @entity11 showed his fragile confidence by playing a soft pass to @entity16 instead of shooting @entity32 watches as his tame pass fails to reach @entity16 during the @entity34 last 32 decider @entity11 knows immediately that he made the wrong decision with the goal at his mercy @entity39 knew people would be wondering about the shooting star on his bench			1
he also knew that if @entity2 , fresh and ready , turns up and grinds @entity44 into the @entity46 dirt on sunday then all will be forgotten			1
indeed , he would be the ‘ genius ’ who figured it all out			0
@entity39 knows better than anyone that such rash judgements have always run always through football			1
win and you ’re smart ; lose and you ’re stupid			0
win on sunday and you picked the right team on thursday , regardless of how you did in @entity56			2
he summed it all up rather neatly on wednesday afternoon when he was asked to explain the dilemmas of selecting a side to play a hard game in @entity62 four days before a potentially season - defining cup final			1
‘ if you make the rotation and on sunday you win , you are a genius			2
sunday you may rest some players and play others and win the final – genius			1
if you lose in @entity69 and the final , you are a bad manager and coach			0
‘ i ’m the same coach but when you take a decision sometimes you are right or wrong , but this is football			0
we take a decision to try to win tomorrow and play better than @entity76			0
after we analyse again and try to put the best team out for the final on sunday			1
’ @entity39 knows that he will be judged on results during this crucial three day period @entity29 's leading scorer @entity2 started on the bench with the @entity83 final on sunday @entity0 did n't travel to @entity56 , but posted a picture of him drinking from a coconut at home it is a black and white view , except here he found a shade of grey			1
it remains to be seen what kind of a beating he will take			0
this was neither an excessively strong side nor one you would say was a cop out to rest players for the weekend			0
@entity2 was the notable omission and you could also make reasonable predictions that @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 will start at @entity46			1
they were all on the bench in @entity56 , with as many of seven of the starters good bets to line up from the beginning against @entity44			1
so the numbers were good			0
but there is no escaping that the club ’s most incisive player was on the bench for a game against a team unbeaten in 10			0
more to the point , @entity29 needed to score to simply stay alive , the consequence of the away goal they conceded at @entity123 last week			2
@entity39 will point to the subtleties of a decision few can fully understand			2
they alone will know how tired @entity2 is after leading this team in his breakthrough season			2
@entity2 was eventually introduced but his second half strike was ruled out for offside the @entity29 academy graduate has gone from reserve striker to the club 's most valuable player this season the inquest begins between @entity29 players as their @entity137 dream fades away football is full of players pushed too hard too soon			1
and in a team that has played 43 games this season – more than any other @entity142 side – fatigue needs to be managed carefully			0
but there have been no indications that @entity2 , in particular , is carrying injuries or struggling with his workload			2
the only indications are that he is a player who scores goals when they are needed			0
they were needed on thursday night as a chance went begging in a competition that rewards its winner with @entity158 football			0
of course it is the kind of short - term thinking that @entity39 dislikes			1
if he scores on sunday , no doubt all will be forgiven			0
@entity44 loanee @entity163 rips off his shirt after scoring @entity76 's second to send the @entity69 through			2

@entity29 were knocked out of the @entity34 by a 2 - 0 ( 3 - 1 agg ) loss
@entity39 gambled by leaving in - form @entity2 on the bench
@entity11 wasted a golden opportunity to give @entity29 the lead
