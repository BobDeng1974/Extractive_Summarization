click here to read @entity2 's match report from the @entity3 at £ 42.5m @entity4 is the most expensive export in the history of @entity8 football			1
after his performance in @entity11 you would n’t pay two - bob for him			1
there should be something special about returning to the country where it all started for the @entity18 midfielder			1
behind those eyes something is going on with @entity4 because he is simply not right			2
he was treated by @entity28 and @entity26 doctor @entity42 at the break and will have a scan on wednesday			2
@entity4 was replaced by @entity45 at half - time and @entity21 said : ‘ he ’s out for a few weeks			1
it is a hamstring injury and it looks quite serious			1
i do n’t know how long and we hope it ’s not so bad			0
’ in the half that he was on the pitch , @entity4 had just 21 touches of the ball			1
to put that into some kind of perspective @entity32 , operating in the heartbeat of @entity28 ’s midfield , had 66			0
want more ? @entity61 : 47			0
@entity4 , the highest - paid player in the history of @entity18 , is nicking a living			1
in the @entity3 , against the world ’s best club side , he had a face on him like a slapped backside until he was substituted at the break			0
he was lucky to get to half - time			1
we have been here before with him , notably at @entity72 , when @entity18 lost 6 - 3 , and again in the 5 - 1 defeat at @entity74			2
withdrawn : a forlorn @entity4 ( centre ) watches the action from the @entity18 dugout change : @entity21 waited until half - time to take @entity4 off , but he could have done it sooner out of sync : @entity4 looked lost , lazy and disinterested in the @entity81 all smiles : @entity4 seemed happy in the pre-match warm - up , but that did n't last long so what if he scored the first of four goals in an @entity89 quarter - final at home to @entity91 at the weekend ? that ’s a sticking plaster			1
there is a wider issue here and it is down to @entity21 to find out what is going wrong with one of the most talented players in the game			0
the exuberance has gone , deserting him at a time when his team - mates are looking to the former @entity105 midfielder for inspiration			2
his time at the @entity108 has gone and he can look wistfully at the team who beat @entity111 6 - 1 at the same stage of this competition all he likes			2
opener : @entity61 fires home to make it 1 - 0 to the defending @entity119 champions mooted : @entity120 celebrates after smashing the ball home to make it 1 - 1 bright spark : in contrast to @entity4 , @entity124 was brilliant for @entity18 opener : @entity4 scored the first of @entity18 's four goals against @entity91 , but that 's not enough good times : @entity4 enjoyed a great relationship at @entity105 with @entity132 - even though he was accused of drifting in and out of games the days when he drifted in and out of games with @entity105 are behind him			1
now he just looks like a lost soul , lazy and disinterested			0
a week ago , in the @entity137 , @entity26 ’s fans were on his back during their victory over @entity140 in a friendly			0
he had set up the only goal for @entity142 , who started this game for @entity28 , but it still was n’t enough to appease them			0
three weeks ago in @entity146 , it was all too much for him after he had missed the chance to put @entity18 ahead from the penalty spot			0
on his back : @entity4 set up a goal in @entity26 's game against @entity140 , but was still subject to jeers from @entity8 fans advanced : @entity153 saw his @entity28 team comfortably take care of @entity18 it was there that his great friend @entity158 saved his spot - kick and after @entity4 ’s game simply fell apart			1
he is better than that			0
this was another limp contribution , a player simply going through the motions as @entity18 inevitably went out of the @entity166 in the second round			2
stationed on the right , where he often plays for the national team , his first and only meaningful contribution was a corner in the 31st minute that was met by the head of @entity174			0
@entity158 did well to save			0
after this , it is down to @entity21 to rescue him			0
limp : @entity4 went through the motions with @entity18 exiting the @entity166 haunted : is @entity4 's penalty miss in the first leg still praying on his mind ? plaudits : @entity28 march into the @entity166 quarter - final			1

@entity4 is the highest - paid player @entity18 have ever had
midfielder is the most expensive export in @entity8 football history
@entity4 was lucky to get to half - time after display in @entity11
he was taken off at the break and replaced by @entity45
@entity4 will have scans on a hamstring injury on wednesday
