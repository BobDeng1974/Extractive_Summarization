by @entity0 first came dogs , then monkeys , and finally humans - so what 's the next logical step in mankind 's space exploration endeavours ? fortunately one group of amateur rocketeers in @entity9 , @entity10 has the answer - they ’ve been busy sending kegs of beer on rocket trips to the final front - beer			1
and in september they ’re planning their most ambitious launch yet as their two - stage rocket will take beer on a short ride towards the cosmos			2
they have previously launched the rocket ( shown , keg is at the top ) in 2008 and 2012 , but this will be the highest flight of the rocket yet , expected to reach about 20,000 feet ( 3.8 miles ; 6.1 kilometres ) the group are known as @entity36 , and have completed two successful launches before			1
the first came in 2008 , when they sent a 15 gallon keg ( 68 litres ) of beer on their 11 - foot ( 3.4 metres ) tall , 350 - pound ( 160 kilograms ) rocket to a height of 6,200 feet ( 1,900 metres )			1
this was followed by another launch in 2012 , which flew to 7,700 feet ( 2,350 metres )			0
but now the team are hoping to more than double their ceiling with their later launch , which is expected to reach close to an altitude of 20,000 feet ( 3.8 miles ; 6.1 kilometres ) at a speed of 650 miles ( 1,050 kilometres ) per hour			1
admittedly it ’s a small fraction of the distance to the ‘ true ’ boundary of space , 62 miles ( 100 kilometres ) up , but it ’s surely a step in the right direction for beer enthusiasts the world over			1
total : £ 2,150 ( $ 3,700 ) £ 700 ( $ 1,200 ) for propellant £ 580 ( $ 1,000 ) for motor hardware £ 465 ( $ 800 ) for parachutes and electronics £ 410 ( $ 700 ) for rocket airframe materials the team ’s rocket has two ‘ stages ’ , different segments holding fuel and cargo			0
the first stage has four of the team ’s large ‘ @entity73 ’ motors , which will provide 1,000 pounds of thrust for 3.5 seconds			0
for a bit of comparison @entity77 ’s @entity76 rocket , the largest rocket ever to fly , had a thrust of 7.5 million pounds at launch			0
@entity36 ’s rocket is powered by a solid rocket propellant known as @entity83 , which looks like gray styrofoam and burns with a violet flame			0
after reaching its max altitude the rocket descends and a parachute brings the keg back to the ground			0
here the team then tap the keg and have a drink of beer after a hard day 's work as rocket scientists the first stage of the rocket will carry a small five - gallon ( 23 litres ) keg of beer , while the second ( upper ) stage of the rocket has a 15 - gallon ( 68 litres ) keg of beer			1
after launching and reaching max altitude , a parachute deploys and brings the beer back to a rather bumpy landing			0
once reaching the rocket the team will then proceed to ‘ tap ’ the keg of beer and drink it , just like they ’ve done on the last two launches			1
the team were seeking £ 1,160 ( $ 2,000 ) on @entity117 to help with funding for the project , but they ’ve now reached their goal			0
and beer - lovers can look forward to the launch in september of this year , although the team warns success is not guaranteed			2
‘ no one else has ever tried to launch a full keg , ’ say @entity36 .			2

@entity36 from @entity9 , @entity10 will launch a keg of beer this september
the group of amateur rocket enthusiasts has done two launches before
their small rocket will launch to a height of 20,000 feet above the ground
admittedly that 's quite a long way from ' space ' , which is *330,000* feet high
the cargo the rocket will carry will be two kegs of beer totally 20 gallons
after *returning* from the trip the team will tap the kegs and drink the beer
