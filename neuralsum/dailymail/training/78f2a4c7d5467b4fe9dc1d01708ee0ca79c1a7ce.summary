by @entity0 for @entity1 they are noble @entity3 creatures , iconic of the @entity4			0
but a pair of @entity7 men on a camping trip to @entity9 last month were left stunned when they discovered a small band of starving brumbies feeding on another horse 's flesh			1
in the words of witness dr @entity16 , the wild horses ' had turned to cannibalism '			1
graphic images below scoll down for video ' @entity21 horses ' : the campers took this picture of the wild horses feeding on one of their brethren			1
' the horses had turned to cannibalism ' : another scene from @entity31			1
noble creatures : wild horses roam the outback			1
ecologists dr @entity16 and dr @entity37 first noticed the dead horse , which had a huge hole in its abdomen , on the way up the hill from @entity43 , in the national park located between @entity45 and @entity46			1
it 's intestines appeared to have been nibbled out			0
it was n't clear what could have caused the damage			0
' i had no idea what could 've done that , ' ecologist dr @entity16 , from the @entity52 , told @entity1			1
but the culprits became clear the next day , as the campers headed back down the hill			2
three emaciated horses stood near the dead brumby			2
two had shoved their snouts inside the fallen creature 's abdominal cavity			0
dr @entity16 ( left ) and dr banks ( right ) produced a documentary about the incident			0
walking away : the brumbies trotted away from the body after the researchers approached			0
@entity73 discovery : the campers discovered the horses eating the body on the way back from @entity79 's @entity78 towards @entity43			1
the animals were nibbling at the animal 's digestive tract , dr @entity16 told @entity1			2
' they were biting at what was left of the insides ... they were obviously starving			2
' horses are herbivores , but dr @entity16 supposed the horses had been pushed to the edge			2
he said he witnessed one of the brumbies bite part of the cavity and pull it off			0
' it was obvious they were being pushed to eat the entrails of the dead horse ... ' ' i suppose desperate times call for desperate measures in the horse world			0
' the wild horses of the @entity104 are ' denizens of the @entity107 psyche ' , dr @entity16 said			1
in a piece for the academic website @entity110 , the scientists wrote : ' as far as we are aware , this behaviour has never been documented before			2
' the noble brumbies of the silver screen have been reduced to starving cannibals in @entity9			2
' dr @entity16 said the number of wild horses in @entity9 was overwhelming			1
the population in the @entity104 has ballooned from an estimated 2369 in 2003 to 7679 in 2009			1
their numbers were forecast to pass 13,000 in 2012			0
' i 've never seen an environment so overwhelmed by feral animals , ' he said			1
and while there is a horse management plan in place , which organises for excess animals to be shuttled away to new homes ( or sometimes taken to the abbattoir ) , dr @entity16 and dr @entity37 argued it would be more humane to cull the creatures from helicopters			0
' it 's really quite tragic , in that the only option to minimise suffering by horses is to shoot them from the air , ' he said			0
' if you do n't shoot them from the air then many more horses are going to suffer and die in the next ten years			0
' the @entity9 's wild horse management plan is currently up for review .			0
