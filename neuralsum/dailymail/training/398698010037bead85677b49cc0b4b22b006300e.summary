by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 10:14 est , 23 january 2014 @entity2 has today been called a ' vile hypocrite ' by his former girlfriend @entity4 for complaining to police about @entity7 trolls			1
the former @entity9 and @entity10 striker punched and kicked the 46 - year - old @entity12 tv presenter in the head 15 years ago during a brutal attack in a @entity16 bar			1
this morning mr @entity2 , 42 , now a radio pundit , quit @entity7 after he started a campaign against online abuse having received a barrage of death threats and racist taunts himself			1
when he got in , he saw @entity4 wearing a @entity45 shirt , pulling pints behind the bar and warned her anyone could jump over the bar at her			2
after flying into a rage he dragged her to floor and kicked her three times in the head before he was dragged away			0
ms @entity4 said the ' malicious bully ' then went back to their hotel room and sliced up her clothes and belongings			2
' now he 's the poster boy against threats online			2
it 's beyond ironic , ' she said today			0
' everyone deserves a second chance but i 've lost count of the chances @entity2 has had			0
he was a textbook abuser '			0
responding today mr @entity2 said : ' there are people using a 15 - year - old story to say well actually you did this now in 2014 , not 1998 , you do not deserve to speak out out about someone writing ' i 'm going to turn up to your house and murder you "			1
' when i 'm trying to talk about safeguards for everybody and live within the laws is to protect people , not me '			0
' a 15 - year - old story is in the past			1
it bears no relevance to me today '			2
accusations : ms @entity4 , who broke up with the footballer on the day after the attack , said today : ' i 've lost count of the chances @entity2 has had			1
he was a textbook abuser ' @entity2 's potentially glittering career was always dogged by reports of him being thrown out of bars , being banned from games and his attack on @entity4			2
he was once caught dogging - but he has never been implicated in a crime			0
speaking about the attack on his ex he said : ' i felt a mixture of jealousy and betrayal - lots of negative emotions rushed into my head and suddenly i hit her in the face ... i apologised to her , of course , privately , then publicly afterwards , although we split up back in @entity109 the next day '			0
@entity7 reaction : @entity2 turned on @entity4 last night and called her ' absolutely desperate ' yesterday he said @entity7 did not go far enough to help police identify the culprits and protect him from abuse			1
the former striker said officers were ‘ banging their heads against the wall ’ because @entity7 was dragging its feet over revealing the trolls ’ identities			0
he was abused online after suggesting that @entity10 striker @entity121 cheated by diving during last saturday ’s match against @entity124			0
he tweeted : ‘ in the last 24 hours i ’ve been threatened with murder several times , demeaned on my race , and many of these accounts are still active			0
why ? i accuse @entity7 directly of not doing enough to combat racist / homophobic / sexist hate messages , all of which are illegal in the @entity133			2
’ call to action : mr @entity2 has received dozens of messages of support from his followers but he has now quit the social network abuse : police have launched an investigation over this message , which mr @entity2 retweeted to his followers @entity7 said targeted abuse was against its rules and there were ‘ established processes ’ to help police in such cases			1
yesterday when challenged about his past mr @entity2 said : ' regardless of what the perception of me as a character is , i have the right to be able to walk down the road , and if someone calls me the n - word to be able to report it and get it to dealt with			1
i would expect that i should be accorded the same courtesy on @entity7			0
’ but @entity7 users , including one called @entity161 , said : ' @ stancollymore do n't expect sympathy for verbal abuse when you were quite happy to deal out physical abuse to @entity4 ! ' ms @entity4 spoke out today in an interview with @entity27 's @entity167 .			1

@entity12 presenter was kicked and punched by star in 1998 @entity16 attack
*ex-footballer* has called for @entity7 to crack down on abusive messages
' if he 's so against death threats , why did he say he 'd ' f * * * * * * kill ' me ? it 's a disgrace , ' ms @entity4 said
' a 15 - year - old story is in the past . it bears no relevance to me today ' , mr @entity2 said
