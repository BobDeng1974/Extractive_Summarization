on @entity2 weekend , all sorts of superlatives are used to describe the long - running rivalry between @entity4 and @entity5 , and rightly so			1
but 24 hours later , 1500 miles east in @entity8 , arguably @entity7 's fiercest derby will be taking place			1
@entity10 vs @entity11 is so intense they call it the ' @entity13 ' and the ' @entity14 ' , and the pictures say it all			1
both are @entity18 gods in their own footballing right , and for decades have battled it out at the top			2
on sunday at 5.30pm , they meet again at @entity11 ' @entity24 home			1
@entity25 brings you all you need to know in bite size chunks			0
@entity18 riot police watch on after a petrol bomb was thrown by @entity10 supporters during a game against @entity11 in 2012 some fired up @entity11 fans are pictured during the @entity35 match at the @entity36 on november 19 , 2011 @entity10 fans breach the barriers to throw chairs at the police during violent clashes with @entity43 ' fans and police the matches between both clubs are known for the volatile and often violent atmosphere among the rivalling fans so , why the rivalry ? the two sides have won 61 @entity18 titles between them , so naturally the competitive rivalry is extremely healthy			1
' you ’ve got @entity54 who are the fanatics			0
they ’re behind one of the goals like a hive of bees			0
the noise , the smoke bombs , the fireworks			0
’ @entity10 goalkeeper @entity65 reflects his summer experience in the ' @entity14			1
' but it runs so much deeper			0
@entity10 , formed in 1908 from the higher classes of @entity8 ' make up , preceded @entity11 by 17 years			1
the ' newcomers ' were from the more working class port of @entity24 , and although the boundaries are far blurrier in the 21st century , the battle to rule @entity8 often results in violence on the pitch , in the stands and around the capital			1
as you can expect , both clubs have the biggest followings in the country , and clashes are the result of two of @entity18 football 's biggest egos , year after year attempting to claim bragging rights			1
how violent can it get ? each picture tells its own story of crowd and player trouble down the years			0
the bizarre sight of all @entity94 players racing off the pitch as quick as possible when the away side wins tells you just how hostile it is			0
a lone @entity10 supporter cowers in a cloud of smoke as a group of armed @entity18 riot police try to calm the hostile scenes @entity10 fans throw seats at police after a game in 1998 where ten people were injured in the violence before and after the match just last season @entity10 manager @entity111 fell to the ground after being hit with an object thrown from the crowd during the 3 - 0 win in @entity24 , and in 2012 the derby was abandoned after petrol bombs were thrown at the @entity118			1
parts of the modern , 70,000 seater stadium , five years after holding a @entity120 final , were on fire			0
flares are thrown around like confetti , firework explosions will make you jump out of your seat … oh , and @entity131 was hit by a water balloon to the face while representing @entity11 in 2003			2
but the rivalry is n't just centred on football , either			0
both clubs have passionately - supported volleyball and basketball teams , and in march 2007 a 22 - year - old @entity10 fan was stabbed to death in violent clashes between hooligans of the two clubs before a women 's volleyball game			1
organised crowd violence is a major issue in @entity18 sport , not just football			2
a plastic water container hits @entity151 in the face in 2003 ; the @entity11 right - back suffered minor injuries @entity155 midfielder @entity154 ( left ) delivers a cross during his side 's 3 - 0 win in 2003 as @entity10 ' fans throw missiles firefighters battle a blaze in the stands of the @entity118 as violence erupts during a night when more than 30 fans and policemen were injured as riot police charged the crowd and made several arrests who wins the footballing battles on the pitch ? olympiacos are 41 - 20 up on league titles and 26 - 18 ahead on @entity175 wins			1
the @entity176 also dominate the head - to - head meetings , winning 76 to @entity10 ' 47			2
in recent years the trend is similar , with @entity10 winning just two of the last 15 meetings			2
and there is n't any wonder why footballing passions are so high in @entity8 ; the honours board for the @entity35 has a particular capital feel to it			2
incredibly , all but five of the last 92 champions have been from @entity8			0
what can we expect from this derby ? @entity11 , winners of the last four titles , are third in the division after four wins from six , trailing the leaders from @entity197 by three points			2
they 're coming off the back of a fine 1 - 0 win over @entity201 in the @entity120 , and they 're unbeaten at home in the league since that defeat to @entity10 in march			0
@entity205 ( second left ) leaps with @entity206 ( second right ) on a night when hooligans ran riot in the @entity18 capital @entity10 striker @entity210 ( centre ) is hit by a flare thrown by @entity11 supporters at the @entity36 stadium earlier this year the @entity215 are sixth , three points behind their rival , and got a hard - fought 1 - 1 draw at @entity219 in the @entity220 in the week			1
they have former @entity223 goalkeeper @entity65 between the sticks , the 30 - year - old choosing to continue his career in @entity227 rather than move to another @entity230 club in the summer			0
you 'll also remember former @entity233 man @entity232 , @entity10 ' front man along with @entity234 @entity210			0
another former @entity233 star , @entity235 , scored the winner against @entity201 for @entity11 , with @entity237 and @entity238 also on their books .			0

@entity5 vs @entity4 may be the @entity2 , but in @entity8 it will be far more fierce
@entity11 host @entity10 on sunday evening in the ' @entity14 '
games between @entity18 's two biggest sides often descend into violence
clashes on and off the pitch have marred games in the past
@entity11 have won four *straight* titles , 41 in total to @entity10 ' 20
