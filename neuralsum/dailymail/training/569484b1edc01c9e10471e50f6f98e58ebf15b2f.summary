@entity0 are demanding full ‘ home rule ’ for @entity1 once new powers over tax and benefits are handed to @entity5 in the biggest constitutional shake - up for decades			1
the @entity8 and @entity9 appear determined to force a @entity11 vote on the issue within months , leaving @entity13 out in the cold by opposing the move			1
@entity15 vowed to publish proposals on @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws before @entity19 , saying yesterday the case was now ‘ unanswerable ’			1
a report by the cross-party @entity29 , published yesterday , set out a new deal for @entity5 following its rejection of independence that will see @entity34 control income tax , vat revenues , air passenger duty and the power to introduce new benefits			1
the package will transform @entity34 into one of the world ’s most powerful devolved parliaments			0
lord @entity43 of @entity44 chaired the @entity29 set up in the wake of the independence referendum in september but within hours , the resurgent @entity47 suggested it was not good enough and @entity5 ’s new first minister @entity48 complained of ‘ continued @entity50 rule ’			1
the settlement also prompted turmoil at @entity50 , with @entity13 split over the implications of @entity1 home rule , under which @entity5 mps would be prevented from voting on measures that only apply to the rest of the @entity58			1
the party could be permanently hobbled if its 40 @entity5 mps are stripped of the right to vote on issues controlled by the @entity34 such as tax , welfare , health and education			1
and there are doubts over whether an mp in a @entity5 seat could ever again be prime minister or chancellor , as they would have only a limited say over proposed legislation			2
mr @entity15 said he was ‘ delighted ’ with the @entity29 report , adding : ‘ i think the report today also makes the case for @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws unanswerable and we will be taking action on that shortly			1
’ although the commission included a promise that mps from across @entity58 can still vote on a national budget , it became clear yesterday that the @entity87 intend a ban to apply to financial matters that only apply to the rest of the @entity58			0
@entity5 @entity0 could therefore be excluded from votes on income tax rates – which could make it impossible for @entity13 to introduce its proposed new 50p top rate of tax even if it wins the general election			1
mr @entity15 ’s spokesman said : ‘ there is going to continue to be a @entity58 budget			2
‘ of course there are elements where you have seen devolution on financial matters , and in that respect i would say the principle of @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws applies			1
in terms of what is for the @entity58 , that will remain @entity58 - wide			0
’ the new powers will be fought over by @entity5 first minister @entity48 and @entity112 , who is a frontrunner in the race to lead @entity13 in @entity5 sir @entity114 said proposals accentuated a ' constitutional imbalance ' between @entity1 and the @entity58 mr @entity117 suggested the @entity9 also want to curb @entity5 mps ’ say over income tax votes			1
‘ we need to look at this issue of how you deal with matters which come up from time to time which only affect @entity1 and @entity125 , ’ he said			2
@entity13 accused the other parties of betraying the promise made in the @entity29			2
mr @entity128 said : ‘ i think it ’s part of the integrity of the @entity58 that it continues to be the place that @entity5 mps vote on the budget			1
’ former commons leader sir @entity114 said the @entity29 proposals ‘ further accentuate the imbalance in the @entity58 constitution between @entity1 and the rest of the @entity58 ’			1
and @entity139 chairman @entity138 said the @entity1 ‘ must have a veto on all laws that largely or exclusively affect them ’			2
former @entity87 cabinet minister @entity147 added : ‘ once @entity5 is determining her own income tax rates and bands in the @entity34 , it would be quite wrong for @entity5 members of this @entity34 to be trying to fix those bands and rates for the @entity1			1
’ @entity13 mp @entity151 called for speedy solution to prevent a surge in @entity1 nationalism			1
the debate raged as @entity156 yesterday picked up an award – and pretended to wipe away tears of pride with a hanky designed like a @entity162 ’s flag			0
the former @entity5 first minister mopped up mock tears in @entity165 as he was named @entity167 ’s @entity166			2
what new powers mean for @entity5 and the rest of us in the dying days of the referendum campaign , the three main @entity50 parties promised @entity5 new powers in a bid to prevent a @entity176 vote			1
yesterday , the @entity29 published its blueprint for implementing the dramatic changes			0
here , @entity180 editor @entity179 examines what it means			0
the @entity183 formula lord @entity183 , pictured , developed a system where @entity5 receives more than £ 1,600 per head in public spending than @entity1 the system under which @entity5 gets £ 1,623 more public expenditure per head than @entity1 – or 19 per cent more – survives			1
if revisions are made , @entity5 must not lose out			2
the funding helps to pay for items such as free prescriptions , not offered in @entity1			2
income tax and vat @entity34 can spend 100 per cent of income tax collected in @entity5 , along with the first 10 per cent of vat			2
this would give it around £ 15billion a year for devolved matters			0
@entity5 would be expected to try to balance its books , but it does not have to live within its means overall			2
over £ 65billion was spent north of the border in 2012 - 13			0
only £ 53billion was raised through taxes			0
tax rates and bands @entity34 can not alter the threshold at which tax is paid – currently £ 10,000 – but it could raise or lower both the basic and higher rates or introduce a new tax band			0
in reality , the @entity211 is likely to reinstate the 50p tax rate for the better - off , to fund an increase in welfare spending or job creation			0
it could lead to high - earning @entity5 domiciling themselves in @entity1			1
there is also the bureaucratic nightmare of how to treat people who live in @entity5 but work in @entity1 , or vice versa			1
borrowing powers should income tax receipts drop in a recession , @entity5 could borrow billions to make up the shortfall – with the permission of the @entity139			2
@entity34 could also borrow to fund capital investment			0
ultimately , @entity50 would have to step in if things went wrong			0
the @entity229 would be left to bail out the scots arguably , the crucial paragraph in the @entity43 report			0
scots get all the benefits of increased independence but very few of the risks			0
in another financial crash it would again be left to the @entity58 to bail out @entity5 banks			2
many taxes reserved to @entity50 @entity241 , inheritance and capital gains tax , corporation tax , fuel and excise duty			0
the @entity211 says 70 per cent of @entity5 taxes will still be set at @entity50			2
in other words , it is not satisfied			0
the idea that devolving power would end the clamour for independence and preserve the @entity254 has already been proved a nonsense			0
mps from across the @entity58 will decide the @entity257 with @entity5 fixing their own income tax levels , there will be demands for @entity5 mps sitting at @entity50 not to vote on tax policy in the rest of the @entity58			1
this could leave a @entity13 government that needed @entity5 mps to form a majority unable to pass its own budget – an untenable position			1
@entity1 votes for @entity1 laws the issue is ignored			1
but there is no way @entity87 mps will not demand constitutional changes to stop @entity5 voting on devolved matters			2
the state pension the @entity58 – not the @entity5 taxpayer – remains on the hook for the most expensive welfare spending			0
this includes basic and additional state pensions , and most of the benefits included in the new @entity285			0
devolved benefits housing benefit , @entity288 , cold weather payments and winter fuel payments are all devolved , giving @entity34 the power to axe the so - called bedroom tax			0
the benefit cap could be set at a higher rate for @entity5 than in the rest of the @entity58			0
the @entity29 is setting out dramatic new powers for @entity5 , ordered in the wake of the referendum on independence which saw @entity5 vote to stay in the @entity58 16 and 17 - year - olds could get the vote for @entity50 elections , the age will remain 18			1
but @entity13 and the @entity9 are committed to giving 16 - year - olds the vote for @entity58 general elections – so the genie may already be out of the bottle			1
rail could be nationalised @entity34 could axe tax on air passengers – so @entity5 airports could undercut @entity1 rivals			1
public sector will be able to bid for rail contracts			0
@entity5 help to agree @entity58 ’s stance in @entity319 discussion of devolved matters if the @entity8 win the election , this may be a headache for mr @entity15 in referendum negotiations with @entity324			1
he will have to haggle not only with other member states , but also with a @entity326			0
consultation to take place on devolving abortion law abortion is legal in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy			0
a rule change in @entity5 could see women crossing the border – in either direction – for the procedure			1
some now travel here from @entity338 , where it is mostly illegal			0
licensing of onshore gas and oil devolved could mean fracking goes on across rest of the @entity58 while @entity5 is largely untouched			0
offshore gas and oil receipts still go to @entity50 .			0

@entity1 @entity0 now want their own ' home rule ' following @entity5 *decision*
@entity15 will publish @entity1 votes for @entity1 law proposals
@entity13 is opposed to the @entity1 votes for @entity1 law plan
the *conservatives* and @entity9 want a vote on the plan in the @entity360
