by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 15:33 est , 8 august 2013 @entity2 engineers have photographed water droplets using a high - speed camera mounted directly above the real liquid beads to investigate how they behave			1
they found that a moving - or ' oscillated - drop of water can form over 30 different shapes , including a ' standing wave pattern ' and an ' azimuthal wave pattern ' experts took the photographs by shining a light through mesh holes and photographing the light that reflected off the drop 's surface as it moved			1
the images were captured on a high speed camera just two of the different shapes the water droplets create			1
the scientists said their study stands out because of the high - quality imaging we were able to capture of these oscillating droplets the researchers believe their results could provide a fundamental insight into how droplets behave and that their study could have applications in everything from inkjet printing to microfluidics			1
@entity42 , assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at @entity20 , led the study , which is published in @entity46 graduate student @entity47 designed and performed the experiments , which involved a high - speed , high - resolution camera , while @entity52 , professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering , and his former student , @entity54 , led the theoretical portion of the study			0
professor @entity57 said : ' what is really special about this study is the high - quality imaging we were able to capture of these oscillating droplets			0
' the droplets were captured when a light was shined through mesh holes and deflection of the drop 's surface refracts the light , which is seen as a deformation of the mesh and is photographed by a high - speed camera the researchers mechanically oscillated the drops at varying frequencies to observe and record their movements			2
here , the movement of a ' zonal ' shaped droplet is captured at regular intervals in milliseconds ' we created an imaging platform where we could look at the drop from the top , to enable us to see the characteristic shapes better than anyone has before			1
' the imaging platform , which @entity87 has named the ' @entity88 ' because of the different angles at which the droplet can be observed , consists of a glass slide , the droplet sitting on top and a 50 - micron - square metal mesh , like a window screen , underneath			2
a light is shined through the mesh holes and deflection of the drop 's surface refracts the light , which is seen as a deformation of the mesh and captured by a high - speed camera			0
the engineers created a special imaging platform to allow them to view water droplets from above , using a high - spreed camera			1
they discovered over 30 distinct shapes , three of which are pictured the researchers mechanically oscillated the drops at varying frequencies to observe and record their movements			1
the oscillation can be likened to when a violin string is plucked			0
certain natural frequencies correspond to a given length of string , the same way certain frequencies correspond to the shape of a drop of a specific size			0
the researchers created a detailed table of droplet shapes according to frequency , as well as comparing these results to previous theoretical predictions involving the dynamics of oscillating droplets			2
@entity133 ( left ) and professor @entity57 ( right ) examine droplets on a silicon wafer treated with a gradient chemical coating			0
the engineers created an imaging platform where they could look at the drop from the top , to enable them to see the characteristic shapes better than anyone has before classical theories do n't capture the dynamics entirely , but new predictions , made by collaborators professor @entity52 and mr @entity54 , take into account the physical effect of the solid substrate in contact with the droplet and match the images in the photo album			1
the researchers also observed that some of the droplets take on multiple shapes when vibrated with a single driving frequency , much like physicists observing two different energy states simultaneously in an excited molecule			2
professor @entity57 said : ' without the high - speed imaging , we would n't have been able to see the drops exhibiting these kinds of mixed behaviors			0
' the engineers believe that their study of the behaviour of water droplets ( pictured ) will inform better methods of printing as the spread of a drop as it touches a surface will dictate image resolution			1
@entity178 , who part - funded the study , is interested in understanding how droplets on surfaces move in low gravity the detailed , clear table of oscillating drop modes should lend insight into further fundamental studies , as well as a host of applications , according to the engineers			2
for example , @entity178 is interested in understanding how droplets on surfaces move in low gravity			0
the research might also prove useful in developing better printers as in high - resolution printing , the spread of a drop as it touches a surface will dictate image resolution			0
the surface chemistry of the roller , printer and ink will have profound effects on the technology .			0

@entity2 engineers discovered moving water droplets can form 30 shapes
the researchers from @entity20 made an imaging platform to look at drops from above in order to identify different shapes
they believe their research shows how droplets behave and could have applications in everything from inkjet printing to microfluidics
