@entity0 looked exhausted as the clock ticked into the 117th minute in @entity2 before he suddenly shifted up a gear to provide @entity4 with a chance on a plate to win the game for @entity8			1
the diminutive number 10 looked frustrated for long periods : left to win the game on his own , heavily marked and being constantly fouled - but when he finally got going he once again lit up the @entity11 by setting up the winner with less than three minutes to go of extra time			1
@entity8 are still on track for a dream @entity11 final with @entity16 and it the end it all came down to @entity0 - again			1
of his last 25 @entity8 games he has won eighteen and drawn four			0
relief : @entity0 piles onto goalscorer @entity4 after brilliantly setting up his goal in the late stages of extra time world class : @entity0 left the @entity27 defenders trailing in his wake before laying the pass on for @entity4 game changing moment : @entity32 ca n't stop @entity0 moments before he sets up @entity4 supporting act : @entity0 goes to celebrate with @entity4 after he set him up for the winner marked man : but @entity0 is used to having the attentions of multiple defenders by now hard to beat : @entity0 escapes one marker but quickly finds himself challenged by another finding a way around : the little genius was constantly met by @entity27 markers as he tried to make an impact @entity44 highlights from qualifiers 19 minutes : after a quiet opening the four - time @entity47 winner brilliantly breaks past two @entity27 defenders , but @entity50 recovers to nick the ball off him			1
48 minutes : @entity52 brings @entity0 down with a cynical trip on the right , which could have forced the referee into issuing the @entity27 midfielder a second yellow card			1
60 minutes : @entity32 is the latest player to foul @entity0 as he looks to link up @entity8 's play in the middle			2
@entity60 seem to be becoming more desperate in their attempts to stop him			0
67 minutes : finding space on the edge of the area , @entity0 takes a bouncing ball on his chest before shooting left footed towards the top corner			1
it has the goalkeeper worried but just goes over the bar			0
74 minutes : working his way into the box on the left , @entity0 drifts in a cross but it is headed wide			1
77 minutes : @entity0 finally gets a real effort in at goal			2
a corner breaks to him , he rounds two @entity27 markers and then fires at goal through two pairs of legs but the ' keeper saves well			2
80 minutes : has the ball nicked from him on the edge of the box after a trademark run			0
88 minutes : @entity0 runs past two but his pass is overhit and the recipient ca n't control it			2
111 minutes : @entity0 labours on a pass and looks frustrated and exhausted after carrying @entity8 this far			1
117 minutes : a brilliant run carves through the @entity27 defence before @entity0 slides the ball right to @entity4 win it			1
he is now so key to @entity8 's play that he was his side 's top tackler - with six - alongside right back @entity96			0
and @entity0 was , of course , constantly at the heart of everything @entity8 did well offensively - although there was n't much of that in a poor game in @entity2			2
throughout the first half the @entity27 were brilliant in their attempts to frustrate the little maestro , springing as many as four markers on him when needed as they nullified the threat of @entity8 's talisman			0
he briefly sparked into life midway through the half but the excellent @entity50 recovered to nick the ball from his toes			0
it looked to be a frustrating afternoon for the man who had scored in all three of his games at this summer 's tournament before facing @entity60 , with @entity8 often forced to go wide and aim crosses into the box - obviously not @entity0 's strength			1
but as the game ebbed on at 0 - 0 , @entity0 began to have more and more influence , dropping deep to pick up the ball between the lines of @entity27 defence and midfield			1
in turn , his opponents changed their approach , with @entity131 and @entity32 among the chief culprits repeatedly fouling the @entity133 and preventing him from running at the defence			0
but these are tactics @entity0 is used to , both at club level and particularly at this @entity11			0
teams crowd him but he tends to find a way through			0
against @entity139 and @entity140 he scored relatively early - but in the 1 - 0 win over @entity143 his winner came in stoppage time - and it looked as though he would have to leave it late again			0
with thirteen minutes to go he fired a warning shot : rounding two defenders and striking between two defenders ' legs before the ' keeper saved			0
as the game reached extra time , @entity8 's talisman looked exhausted and again drifted out of the game - but his play for the goal was class , drifting past defenders with a trademark run before slipping the ball to @entity4 to win the game			1
control : @entity0 tries to get away from @entity60 's @entity164 in @entity2 's @entity165 snapshot : @entity8 's talisman unleashes a shot but could not quite make the breakthrough struggle : @entity0 and @entity52 get to know each other a little better in this grappling match breaking away : @entity0 started to exert his influence more as the game went on in @entity2 angry : @entity0 shows his frustration in the midst of a tussle involving him and @entity177 nearly : @entity0 sends a dipping effort over the crossbar in the second half banner : better than @entity181 ? @entity0 struggled to show his skills in the first half under tight marking @entity184 leaves it late for @entity8			2

@entity0 wins his fourth man of the match award in four games in @entity16
as the @entity27 tired he became more influential , but was often fouled
he made more tackles than anyone else in the 90 minutes
@entity0 looks exhausted during the extra time period
but he stepped it up a gear to win the game with three minutes left
