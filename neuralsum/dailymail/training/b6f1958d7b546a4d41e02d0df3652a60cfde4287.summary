the @entity1 congressman tapped to deliver a spanish - language version of his party 's @entity5 rebuttal tuesday night added in a little extra salsa , and it 's causing the @entity1 some wednesday morning heartburn			1
@entity11 rep. @entity10 's speech was billed as a ' @entity12 translated address ' offered alongside the higher - profile @entity15 delivery of @entity18 sen. @entity17			1
but he inserted lines about immigration and the @entity23 's new @entity22 policy days beforehand			1
speaking in @entity12 , @entity10 said @entity1 should ' work through the appropriate channels to create permanent solutions for our immigration system , to secure our borders , modernize legal immigration , and strengthen our economy			1
' ' in the past , the president has expressed support for ideas like these , ' he said			0
' now we ask him to cooperate with us to get it done			0
' @entity17 did n't mention the contentious topic at all			2
@entity11 @entity1 rep. @entity10 gave a @entity12 - language @entity5 response address on tuesday night that did n't match the @entity15 version in several key respects – adding lines about @entity22 and immigration @entity18 @entity1 sen. @entity17 never mentioned president @entity47 's revamped @entity22 policy , and did n't advocate for changes in @entity50 immigration policy , but both items made it into the @entity12 ' translation ' @entity10 raised hackles in the @entity1 caucus after his election in november by suggesting that if president @entity47 were to move unilaterally to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants , it might be perfectly legal			1
' yeah , it can be ( legal ) , ' he told @entity63 newspaper in november , before @entity47 outlined his ambitious proposal to guarantee 5 million or more people living in the @entity50 illegally that they wo n't be deported while he 's in office			2
@entity10 added that @entity47 should keep his powder dry and give the new @entity68 a chance to act			1
but he has already voted against legislation to undo @entity47 's executive actions , indicating that he favors giving many illegal immigrants residency paperwork and work permits			1
the 34 - year - old @entity74 also mentioned @entity22 on tuesday night , torching the @entity47 administration for pledging to reestablish diplomatic ties there and open an embassy in @entity79			1
@entity10 called it ' essential that the @entity50 supports its allies and holds its enemies accountable			2
' ' we are disturbed by the administration 's undeserved concessions to the regimes @entity87 and @entity22 , ' he said in his speech			1
' both countries are ruled by cruel dictatorships that decades have tried to harm our country and our allies			1
' @entity93 : @entity22 and @entity50 delegations are meeting on wednesday in @entity79 to take part in negotiations to restore diplomatic ties between the two countries and eventually normalize relations @entity10 , 34 , has already broken with his party on immigration and opposed a measure blocking president @entity47 's executive ' amnesty ' for millions of illegal immigrants @entity17 's only mention of the @entity108 regime was a soft pledge to ' work to confront @entity87 's nuclear ambitions			1
' but she never brought up @entity22			2
@entity10 is @entity113 , so his audience would likely have been surprised if he omitted talk of the island nation just 90 miles from @entity11			2
@entity47 , in fact , gave his rebooted @entity22 policy two paragraphs – including four applause lines – in an already crowded @entity5 speech			1
' we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date , ' he said			0
' when what you 're doing does n't work for 50 years , it 's time to try something new			2
' ' and our shift in @entity22 policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere			2
it removes a phony excuse for restrictions in @entity22			0
it stands up for democratic values , and extends the hand of friendship to the @entity22 people			0
and this year , @entity68 should begin the work of ending the embargo			0
' most republicans and a sizable contingent of @entity147 have approached the president 's policy shift with suspicion , even as formal negotiations got underway on wednesday between @entity22 and @entity50 diplomats			1
@entity22 dictator @entity152 and his ailing brother @entity153 are still @entity154 no. 1 and no. 2 among @entity22 emigres living in the @entity50			0
and @entity10 was talking directly to them			0
house speaker @entity159 's press secretary , @entity158 , told @entity160 that any controversy generated by the two different speeches is much ado about nothing			0
' as in previous years ' @entity5 responses , senator @entity17 and congressman @entity10 spoke of the @entity1 vision of commonsense solutions and greater opportunity for everyone in this country – framed by their unique stories and experiences , ' @entity158 said			1
@entity22 dissident @entity175 , known by the nickname ' @entity175 , ' was among pro-democracy activists invited to the @entity5 address by @entity23 speaker @entity159 and other @entity1 back to work : @entity17 took her seat in the @entity182 hearing room on wednesday less than 12 hours after her star turn as the @entity1 's official @entity47 - debater @entity186 chairman @entity185 shrugged it off during a wednesday morning interview on @entity189			1
' i do n't think it 's that strange to have multiple people giving multiple responses , ' he said of the mixed signals			0
curbelo himself told @entity196 that @entity147 should n't gleefully ' criticize us for each of us having our own priorities and ideas and making them known			0
' he claimed the @entity1 leadership was aware of changes he had made and approved			2
' ' i did not get any pushback whatsoever , ' @entity10 said			0
he told the @entity206 that party higher - ups ' had no problems			0
i do n't want people to think there was a fight			0
' however , he said , he did n't add in personal beliefs of his that might be too contentious for many @entity1			0
the speaker 's office does n't seem concerned that @entity17 did n't address @entity1 ' conflict with the president over his @entity22 policy			1
@entity159 's guests at the @entity221 on tuesday night included two leaders of @entity22 's resistance movement			1
@entity175 spent 17 years as a political prisoner for publicly denouncing @entity153 's regime			0
( he was released in 2007			0
) his wife , @entity226 , founded the @entity227 to help homeless women and children in @entity22			0
@entity47 , on the other hand , brought freed @entity22 prison @entity231 as a token of his own negotiating success			1
@entity11 @entity235 sen. @entity235 also brought @entity22 dissidents to the speech , as did reps			2

sen. @entity17 delivered the @entity1 ' official response to president @entity47 's @entity5 speech tuesday night

he *blasted* ' the administration 's undeserved concessions ' to @entity22 and @entity87 , ' cruel dictatorships that decades have tried to harm our country '
also said @entity1 should ' work through the appropriate channels to create permanent solutions for our immigration system '
@entity10 *insists* the party leadership never *objected*
but the @entity1 had promised a ' translated address , ' not a separate speech for @entity12 - speaking audiences
