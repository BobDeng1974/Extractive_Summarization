@entity1 's bid to become the @entity3 super middleweight champion ended in misery after he was outpointed by @entity5 and then disrespected by the judges all in one night			1
it was always going to be a big ask for @entity1 , in his first world title fight , getting a decision in @entity10 against a champion like @entity5 , fighting for the world crown for the 19th time			1
but he started like a train and then ended like one , giving him , his team , the 1,000 brits in the @entity15 and the many supporting back in @entity17 hope that he may have scraped a draw , maybe even nicked a sensational win with a stirring late surge			0
@entity5 beat @entity1 on points to retain his @entity3 super-middleweight title @entity1 was unable to get the better of @entity5 and was behind on all of the judges scorecards @entity1 looks distraught during the post-fight press conference following his defeat by @entity5 @entity31 : why have judges if they do n't judge correctly			1
robbing people of their dreams			0
the boxing board has to act			0
@entity37 : absolute nonsense , there has to be something done about these type of decisions			0
@entity1 should be @entity3 champion tonight			1
@entity44 : once again the officiating is being spoken about ! disgraceful scoring ! hold your head high mate			0
poor poor judging ! @entity49 : i had @entity1 by a round			1
would n't of moaned at a draw but no way he lost			0
@entity54 : feel for @entity1 , thought he won that			1
@entity56 up champ you boxed well and done everyone proud mate			0
deserved to be champion of the world			0
however , all three judges gave it to @entity5 , two by six rounds and a score of 117 - 111 and the third a frankly ridiculous 119 - 109 by @entity67 judge @entity66			1
it was a bitter end to such an absorbing spectacle as @entity1 , who had said in the build - up that the ' stars aligned ' for him this time , set about the fading yet dangerous champion			1
@entity5 punched hard but not all that often , although he seemed to hurt @entity1 at times and arguably did enough to win the fight and retain his @entity3 belt			1
but the way in which the judges scored the bout , so thrilling and competitive at times , is another serious blow to the credibility of the sport			1
@entity1 , incredulous , said : ' what can you do ? it 's disgusting			1
it 's the main thing i hate about boxing			0
most of them have never fought and they 're robbing kids of life changing opportunities			0
@entity1 put in a good performance in @entity10 , but it was not reflected in the judges scorecards @entity1 lost on all three scorecards , 117 - 111 , 117 - 111 and 119 - 109 ' i proved i 'm not @entity99 level			1
i did some things wrong but i did a lot of it right			0
i was outworking him every round for me			0
i was shading a lot of the rounds			0
it 's @entity10 , i well and truly got my fingers burnt			0
' @entity109 and @entity110 have both been on the end of wrong decisions in @entity10 and @entity114 trainer here , @entity115 , was in the corner for the @entity109 fight , which took place in @entity119 a little over three years ago			2
he knows what happens here			0
but he had watched hours and hours of footage of the champion in action , both his more devastating middleweight days but also some of his less impressive victories at the 168lb super-middleweight limit			2
in watching @entity5 at his best and worst , @entity115 had formulated a game plan which he and @entity1 were confident would be enough to dethrone ' @entity129 '			1
@entity5 and @entity1 's fight was a lot closer than the judges scorecards suggested and it worked early on with @entity1 setting a frenetic pace against @entity5 , who , as is his trademark , threw punches only occasionally			1
there was an argument that the challenger won the first two rounds but then the champion found his stride			0
the message from @entity115 throughout the week had been to ' stay with ' @entity5 , once considered one of the planet 's most ferocious punchers			2
it meant that the @entity150 was absorbing an awful lot of punishment and also losing the middle rounds			0
but much of the build - up had been dominated by the accusation that @entity5 had not taken this fight seriously and he struggled to boil down to the 168lb super-middleweight limit			1
as revealed by @entity160 this week , the @entity159 - based @entity158 had been regularly spotted running in a sweat suit along the @entity162 here in @entity164 - an old - school method of draining out the final few pounds			2
and , whether it was a question of conditioning or just his usual style , @entity5 certainly faded towards the end , giving @entity1 and his team renewed hope			1
however , all of that was crushed when the scores were announced and @entity1 's fate sealed			1
@entity1 looks devastated as the scores are read out after his defeat to @entity5 @entity5 held onto his @entity177 with a points win over @entity1 in @entity10 but the 31 - year - old , once considered the forgotten man of the @entity99 super-middleweight scene after knock - out defeats to younger pair @entity184 and @entity185 , proved here in @entity164 that he belongs at world level			1
earlier , @entity109 got his career back on track by outpointing @entity191 @entity190 over eight rounds in his first fight under the banner of @entity195			2
@entity109 signed with @entity196 back in july and was supposed to headline a big homecoming show in @entity199 on august 31			0
however when his trainer , @entity201 , was shot in @entity202 less than a month before the fight , the whole card was cancelled			2
but he finally made his bow here in the opening bout of the evening , and his first fight for 10 months			2
there were some definite signs of rust against the tough 35 - year - old			2
@entity212 was the more eye - catching work but there was no denying that he got tagged more than he would have wanted but did enough to claim the victory			2
the third @entity217 in action in @entity164 was @entity220 cruiserweight @entity219 , managed by @entity184 and trained by @entity221 , who was boxing for the second time in a week after making his debut at @entity223 last saturday			0
he moved to 2 - 0 with a points victory over four threes , against a late stand - in @entity227 .			2

@entity5 beats @entity1 on points to retain @entity3 super-middleweight title
the judges scored the fight 117 - 111 , 117 - 111 and 119 - 109
@entity1 was disgusted by the scores and margin of defeat
