reports of crimes involving @entity2 and @entity3 - such as posting abusive messages , grooming and complaints of stalking - have increased eight-fold in four years			1
in 2008 , a total of 556 complaints were made to police , according to the statistics released by 29 police forces in a @entity15 request			1
but the phenomenon of social networking crime has grown substantially and last year 4,908 offences were reported in which the two sites were a factor			1
the figures show 653 people were charged for social networking crime in 2011 alone			1
@entity49 charged the highest number of people , at 115			1
@entity52 received reports of six threats of murder and there were numerous sexual offences as well as allegations of racially aggravated conduct and reports of fraud			1
civil liberties campaigners said the statistics demonstrate how some police forces had ' lost all proportion ' in dealing with social media complaints			2
they added that the figures reveal how poorly some police forces have dealt with complaints about comments made online			2
@entity71 , director of civil liberties campaign group @entity72 , said : ' these figures show just how badly some police forces had lost all proportion when dealing with social media			2
' so many arrests was clearly undermining freedom of speech and while the new guidance should reduce the problem , hundreds of people now have criminal records for the rest of their lives when it is far from clear they should do			2
' the law around speech crimes is still in need of a total overhaul as the legislation that led to some of the more absurd prosecutions remains in place			2
' chief constable @entity38 , the @entity96 ’ lead on communications , said forces must prioritise crimes which cause genuine harm , rather than attempting to curb freedom of expression			1
@entity31 's conviction for joking on @entity3 about blowing up @entity36 in @entity105 was one of the most high profile social networking crime cases in recent years			2
mr @entity31 tweeted ‘ @entity36 is closed			0
you ’ve got a week and a bit to get your s * * * together otherwise i am blowing the airport sky high ! ! ’ when it was closed because of snow			0
jailed : nine people were ordered to pay the woman raped by footballer @entity117 , pictured , £ 624 for naming her on @entity3 or @entity2 he was convicted in may 2010 of sending a menacing communication under the @entity33 , when an airport security official saw the tweet five days later			1
mr @entity31 was supported by the likes of @entity123 and @entity124 during his appeal and his conviction was eventually over turned at the @entity127 in february			0
since then the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) set a ' high threshold ' for police intervention in social networking crime intervention , which is expected to result in fewer criminal charges being brought			0
director of public prosecutions @entity133 announced the new guidelines on how people who post offensive messages on @entity2 and @entity3 should be dealt with			1
mr @entity137 admitted the @entity128 made the wrong ' judgement call ' in the @entity140 case			0
he said : ' in most cases , once you have put the ( new ) safeguards in place then a prosecution is unlikely to be the appropriate response			0
' to that extent , therefore , it is to make it less likely that these cases will be prosecuted			0
' other high - profile cases involving social media include nine people who were each ordered to pay compensation to a woman raped by @entity117 who they named on @entity3 or @entity2			1
mr @entity38 said social media poses new challenges for police			0
total number of complaints and charges from 29 forces 2008 - 556 complaints and 46 charges 2011 - 4,908 complaints and 653 charges @entity49 charged 115 people this year - the most in the country @entity168 only charged five people from 27 complaints @entity171 received 700 complaints - more than any other force that replied @entity174 charged 54 people this year from 579 complaints			1
in 2008 just one person was charged from 19 complaints he said : ' it is a new world for all and we could end up in a situation where each constabulary needs a dedicated @entity3 squad			1
in my opinion , that would not be a good use of resources in difficult financial times			0
' we need to accept that people have the right to communicate , even to communicate in an obnoxious or disagreeable way , and there is no desire on the part of the police to get involved in that judgment			2
' but equally , there are many offences involving social media such as harassment or genuine threats of violence which cause real harm			1
it is that higher end of offending which forces need to concentrate on			0
' police forces that responded to a @entity15 request said 653 people faced criminal charges this year over allegations involving the two sites that included posting abusive messages ad crimes that were provoked by postings such as violent attacks			1
four years ago just 46 people were charged			2
@entity221 received 66 reports involving the sites this year , 44 of these involved sending obscene or menacing messages and in @entity225 21 of the 76 crimes reported this year involved harassment			1
other notable cases that have caused fierce debate about freedom of speech include that of @entity232 , 17 , who was given an official warning for ' offensive ' tweets he posted about diver @entity235			0
last month , @entity236 , 19 , was arrested after complaints were made about a tweet in which he was seen burning a @entity240			0
he was arrested by @entity242 but did not face prosecution for the picture , which he published in the early hours of @entity246			0
mr @entity38 said offences involving social media can be roughly divided between crimes which would have been committed , albeit in a different way , before the emergence of social media and those which exist because of the online platform			1
' there is an issue of public expectation , ' he said			0
' we have to respect free speech and can not have police forces responding simply because of public outcry			0
' in many ways , online communities can be self - regulating and good at weeding out unacceptable behaviour			0
we need to find a way of distinguishing between that type of behaviour and that which requires police intervention			0

crimes include posting menacing messages , and sexual offences such as grooming
in 2008 there were just 556 reports of crimes ; last year there were 4,908
in 2011 , 653 people were charged for crimes involving @entity2 and @entity3
