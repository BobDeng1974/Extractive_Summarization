a furious and sceptical senator has blasted a report by the @entity2 into the 2012 attack on a @entity5 diplomatic facility in @entity6 , saying it is ' full of crap '			1
senator @entity9 ( @entity10 - @entity11 ) said the results of the investigation , which clears the government of wrongdoing in its response to the crisis in @entity18 , are evidence of a ' lousy job '			1
the document , released friday , said the @entity22 , military , and the @entity24 did their jobs right in the wake of a militant attack on the facility which killed a @entity5 ambassador			1
' full of crap ' : @entity31 senator @entity9 lashed out at the report , which he said shows the @entity31 - led @entity2 is doing a ' lousy ' job under attack : a vehicle and the surrounding area are engulfed in flames after being set on fire inside the @entity5 consulate compound in @entity6 late on september 11 , 2012 but its analysis , especially the notion that nobody lied or covered anything up , struck the senator as ' complete garbage '			1
@entity9 gave his forthright response in an interview on @entity50 , and implied the report was untrustworthy because some of those involved in writing it had misled congressmen in a hearing on the attacks			1
the fact that the @entity2 is dominated by @entity31 did nothing to dampen his criticism			2
when asked why the @entity31 chair of the committee , @entity64 representative @entity63 , would accept the report , he answered ' good question '			2
according to @entity9 all the report proves is that the group ' is doing a lousy job policing its own '			1
the two - year investigation of the politically charged incident determined that there was no intelligence failure , no delay in sending a @entity22 rescue team and no missed opportunity for a military rescue			1
it also debunked allegations that the @entity22 was covertly shipping arms from @entity18 to @entity81			2
the final report : a two - year investigation by the @entity31 - controlled @entity2 has found that the @entity22 and the military acted properly in responding to the 2012 attack on a @entity5 diplomatic compound in @entity6 , @entity18 damage : a burnt house and a car are seen inside the @entity5 embassy compound following the overnight attack			1
it was initially believed the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video but was later determined to have been a terrorist attack in the immediate aftermath of the attack , intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory , the report found			0
it was that , the report said , which led @entity105 , then @entity5 ambassador to the @entity106 , to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest which did not exist			0
but the flaws , the report said , came from intelligence analysts who made mistakes , rather than politicians or an intent to mislead			0
many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a @entity122 panel			0
the eighth @entity6 investigation is being carried out by a @entity124 appointed in may			0
the attacks in @entity6 killed @entity5 ambassador @entity126 , foreign service officer @entity127 , and two @entity22 contractors , @entity129 and @entity130			2
a @entity18 extremist , @entity132 , is facing trial on murder charges after he was captured in @entity18 and taken to the @entity5 in the aftermath of the attacks , @entity31 criticized the @entity138 administration @entity136 , who was then secretary of state			0
people in and out of government have alleged that a @entity22 response team was ordered to ' stand down ' after the @entity122 compound came under attack , that a military rescue was nixed , that officials intentionally downplayed the role of @entity147 figures in the attack			1
none of those allegations is true , according to the report			0
the report did find , however , that the @entity122 facility where @entity126 and @entity127 were killed was not well - protected , and that @entity122 security agents knew they could not defend it from a well - armed attack			0
previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in @entity160			0
' we spent thousands of hours asking questions , poring over documents , reviewing intelligence assessments , reading cables and emails , and held a total of 20 committee events and hearings , ' said rep. @entity63 , along with his @entity171 counterpart , @entity172 rep. @entity170			0
' we conducted detailed interviews with senior intelligence officials from @entity6 and @entity175 as well as eight security personnel on the ground in @entity6 that night			0
they said : ' based on the testimony and the documents we reviewed , we concluded that all the @entity22 officers in @entity6 were heroes			2
' rep. @entity184 , a @entity186 @entity185 who serves on the intelligence panel and the @entity6 select committee , said , ' it 's my hope that this report will put to rest many of the questions that have been asked and answered yet again , and that the @entity193 will accept these findings and instead focus its attention on the @entity122 's progress in securing our facilities around the world and standing up our fast response capabilities			2
' senator @entity9 , however , has promised a ' hard review ' of the report .			1

@entity11 senator @entity9 savaged report in tv interview
document , released by @entity2 , was released friday
cleared the government , military and @entity22 of any wrongdoing
@entity9 said that all the report proves is the committee is ' doing a lousy job '
