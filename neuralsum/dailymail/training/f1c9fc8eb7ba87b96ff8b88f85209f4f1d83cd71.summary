by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 16:20 est , 31 january 2013 they say that 40 is the new 30 - and one look at @entity3 confirms that			0
the 43 - year - old actress dazzled at the @entity6 earlier this month wearing a leather skater dress by @entity8 that a couple of decades ago would have been fashion fodder reserved for nubile twentysomethings			1
of course , it helps that @entity3 has the figure for it - better than most women half her age - and the youthful complexion to match			0
but with her daring skin dress , what @entity3 proves is that women of a certain age need n't be pigeon - holed , nor strong - armed by stylists into safe ( read : dull ) column dresses or dreary chiffon			2
trendsetter : @entity3 in her leather @entity8 skater dress , and right : the @entity29 leather skater dress , £ 249 @entity3 proves there is no need to dump your mini skirts , flippy dresses and , yes , leather - as long as you do it right			1
and now , as @entity29 release a brown leather skater dress for @entity39 , they are giving women of @entity41 the chance to embrace the leather look too			1
take a tip from @entity3 when you style this one up			0
she kept things simple : her hair glossy and youthful , her make - up natural			0
too much and she could have risked tipping edgy into trashy			0
as it was though , she rocked it			0
elsewhere in the land of leather , we have for inspiration @entity54 actress @entity53 , 42 , in full - length leather at the @entity57 , and @entity59 star @entity58 , 52 , looking rather fabulous in a leather - corseted dress at the same event			1
but the award for wearing leather over 40 has to go to @entity64 , who can wear anything from an all - in - one white leather trouser ensemble to a leather maxi skirt with the utmost panache			2
the secret to her success ? always accessorise your leather get - up with a toyboy			2
later in life leather lovers : glee star @entity58 , 52 , wore a @entity77 gown with studded leather corset for the @entity57 awards last week			1
right : @entity54 actress @entity53 , 42 , won mixed reviews for her full - length leather @entity84 dress - but there is no denying she looks sensational for her age skin queen : @entity64 is the only woman alive who could pull off a white kick - flare leather trouser suit			1
right : @entity3 , 42 , with boyfriend @entity64 , 25 , proves the best accessory for leather over 40 is a toyboy			0
