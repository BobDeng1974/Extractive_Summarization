they fled to @entity6 where they hoped to sell their holiday home in the @entity40 to pay for specialist treatment in the @entity42			0

they did n’t abandon @entity84			0
‘ they did n’t need any permission because if you are a parent you have custody			0

’ the lawyer said the @entity25 ’ eldest son @entity94 , 23 , had been allowed to see @entity0 in hospital in @entity96 yesterday			2
but another brother @entity97 , 20 , said none of the family were allowed to see him and a source said all visits would be banned without permission from a judge			0

in a video blog posted on @entity158 before his arrest he said he had pleaded for the proton beam therapy but said doctors said it would not help @entity0 ’s type of tumour			1
mr @entity77 said : ‘ they will be taking legal action against the doctors who libelled him [ mr @entity4 ] in the hospital and they will file a criminal complaint for false detention and libel			0

@entity16 police have travelled to @entity6 and yesterday defended the decision to have the couple arrested			2
