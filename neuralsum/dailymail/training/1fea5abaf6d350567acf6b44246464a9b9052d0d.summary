by @entity0 a drastic change in weather caused by a slow down in the @entity3 - as predicted in the box office hit , @entity5 - could be more science fact than fiction , according to a new report			1
while temperatures were recently set plunging across the @entity11 thanks to a polar vortex , the @entity9 could be headed for warmer , drier weather in time for the summer , say scientists from @entity16			1
they claim there has been a definite 10 to 15 per cent slowdown in the @entity3 , which brings a constant flow of warm water and mild weather to northern @entity22 - and the change could result in ' big impacts ' on the weather system for years to come			2
here comes the sun : @entity9 's short heatwaves could be a thing of the past , with predictions the @entity9 will experience warmer , drier summers this exact scenario appears in the 2004 sci - fi blockbuster starring @entity32 and @entity33 , in which a shutdown of the @entity36 currents plays havoc with the weather and sends temperatures plunging to a chilly minus @entity40			0
previous scientific reports have also suggested a slowdown in the @entity3 would result in chillier temperatures around @entity22 and rising temperatures elsewhere			2
but the latest findings from the @entity46 suggest @entity9 will actually experience drier summers , with a possibility of drought in @entity22 and @entity49 as temperatures rise			1
there may also be fewer @entity36 hurricanes , as the strength of the @entity3 declines			0
lead author dr @entity54 , told @entity55 on sunday : ' in @entity9 we could see a return to drier summers , although it could also lead to more droughts in parts of @entity22 and @entity49			1
' however , there 's quite a bit of uncertainty about how fast changes might happen			0
' the prediction of drier summers is in direct contrast to @entity9 's current wet winter , which has caused widespread flooding for thousands across @entity68 and @entity69			0
science - fact : the extreme weather conditions predicted in blockbuster @entity5 , could be at least partly true , according to the new report slow down : the @entity3 pictured in red , is declining in strength , according to a new report there is however no need to pack away umbrellas just yet			0
research director professor @entity80 added the report is not a prediction for this summer or any other year , but is instead suggestive of a ' trend towards drier summers across the @entity9			0
' wettest winter : the @entity9 is currently experiencing stormy and wet conditions , causing widespread flooding , but scientists predict our summers will become dry and warm dry conditions : if the report 's predictions are true , drought could regularly affect parts of @entity22 and @entity49			1

scientists claim @entity9 set for drier , *hotter* summers as @entity3 slows
previous reports suggested change would bring *colder* weather to the @entity9
but new report from @entity16 claims weather will get warmer and could also bring regular drought to parts of @entity22 and @entity49
