from fossilised iguanas to @entity3 's head , conspiracy theorists appear to have found all manner of things on @entity6			1
and now an alien coffin can be added to the list , after one @entity11 - based @entity10 hunter spotted what he believes to be a ' decorative ' box on the red planet			1
the ' coffin ' was discovered by @entity16 from @entity17 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the @entity6 rover curiosity			1
the image pictured inset has been edited ' this little box sure does look like a modern coffin concrete liner , ' he wrote on his @entity30 channel			2
' as well as the stonework on the back part of the hill that looks like stairs or some left over stonework from some old civilisations constructions			2
' alien researcher @entity38 of the @entity39 said he believes the coffin was made from a stone - like substance			2
' what would it take to get @entity44 to turn the rover around and examine the contents of this box ? , ' he said			0
can you spot the coffin ? alien researcher @entity38 of the @entity39 said he believes the coffin was made from a stone - like substance ' what would it take to get @entity44 to turn the rover around and examine the contents of this box ? , ' said mr @entity38			1
but while it has captured the imagination of @entity10 bloggers , scientists believe sightings such as this are down to a phenomenon called pareidolia - a psychological response to seeing items in random places many scientists believe that seeing strange objects , such as a ' coffin ' on @entity6 , is simple a case of pareidolia			1
this is a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random places			1
it is a form of @entity76 , which is when people see patterns or connections in unconnected data			0
there have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places , especially the faces of religious figures			2
many involve images of @entity91 , the @entity92 and the word @entity94			0
for example , in september 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey , leading believers in @entity100 to pay homage to the @entity103 god			0
another famous instance was when @entity92 ’s face was a grilled cheese sandwich			0
images of @entity91 have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of @entity110 and in a potato			0
' it looks to be about 3.2 ft ( one metre ) across and 1.5ft ( 0.4 metres ) wide and high			1
' lots of alien species are short , including a species of grays			1
' @entity10 researchers use the term ' grays ' to describe alien visitor with an oval shaped head and large eyes – similar to the depiction shown in the film ' @entity126 '			1
but while its strong lines have captured the imagination of @entity10 bloggers , scientists believe sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called @entity135			1
this describes the brain 's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random places			1
it has evolved so that human eyes can spot faces within their environment , and to help them recognise friends in a crowd			0
scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to ' enrich our imagination ' and recognise meaningful shapes , even when they 're not there			1
however , mr @entity16 is n't convinced			1
' we 're not being told a whole bunch of stuff , so i do n't know what the truth is here , ' he said			0
' in reality @entity10 enthusiasts just spend far too much time searching @entity44 images for the slightest glimpse of anything weird and finding proof that fits their own ideas , ' @entity159 , author of the @entity160 told @entity169			1
' in addition to the discovery of this coffin , way back in march 2014 ' @entity173 ' posted on @entity30 a picture taken by the @entity175 that seemed to show a cross , which he thought was connected to a religious ceremonial religious structure			1
mr @entity38 suggests the coffin may hold a species of grays			2
@entity10 researchers use the term ' grays ' to describe alien visitor with an oval shaped head and large eyes - similar to the depiction shown in the film @entity126 ( pictured ) ' he went on to speculate that it marked the position of a tombstone and claimed to have seen other images of the cross on the @entity6 surface			1
@entity196 worshipping aliens on @entity6 ? ' the possibilities are intriguing but there is n't much firm evidence except that it does underline the adage that " seeing is believing "			0
' the find follows a similarly bizarre claim made in november , when a lady claiming to be a former @entity44 employee said she had seen humans on @entity6			2
the woman , named ' @entity208 ' , called into @entity210 radio station , @entity211 , with a ' confession ' that she had witnessed suited men running on the red planet in 1979			0
other objects found in images of @entity6 include what some @entity10 hunters claim to be a fossilised iguana ( left )			1
stock image of an iguana is pictured right @entity208 said she was working as part of a ' downstairs ' team downloading telemetry from a @entity225 when she saw the humans via live feed			0
' i wonder if you could solve a 27 - year - old mystery for me , ' she asked the presenter			0
' that old @entity225 rover was running around			0
' then i saw two men in space suits - not the bulky suits we normally used , but they looked protective			0
they came over the horizon walking to the @entity238			0
' earlier this year , dr @entity239 , a plasma physicist at @entity240 , said he believes an ancient civilisation on @entity6 was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race			2
dr @entity239 claimed ancient @entity245 known as @entity246 and @entity247 were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today			0
he claimed his theory could explain the @entity252 - namely why , if the universe is abundant with life , we have n't heard anything from anyone else yet			0
earlier this month , @entity10 enthusiasts claimed to have spotted @entity3 's head on the @entity6 surface			2
they say a panoramic image from 2005 taken by the @entity262 shows a rock shaped uncannily like his head			0

' @entity267 ' was found by @entity16 on an image taken by @entity175
mr @entity16 claims the structure may be left over from an old civilisation
@entity10 hunters claim it is 3.2 ft ( 1 metre ) across and 1.5ft ( 0.4 metres ) wide
conspiracy theorists suggest it is big enough to contain ' alien grays '
but scientists said seeing such objects could be a case of pareidolia
it is a psychological response to seeing *familiar* objects in random places
