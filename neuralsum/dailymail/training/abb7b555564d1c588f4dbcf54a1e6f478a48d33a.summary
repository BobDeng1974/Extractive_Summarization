@entity0 has told his @entity2 players to blot out the latest round of off - field headlines ahead of saturday ’s championship clash with @entity6			1
the @entity8 side could slide nine points behind the @entity11 leaders if they lose at @entity12			1
they travel east against a backdrop of 10 job cuts among administrative staff at the club , fresh calls from former director @entity19 for fans to starve the club of cash and former owner @entity23 facing a warrant for his arrest			1
‘ i keep saying to the players the only thing they should concentrate on are the things they can affect , ’ @entity0 told @entity26			1
@entity0 boss @entity0 has urged his players to ignore the latest round of off - field headlines ‘ to a man , they have come in and trained their socks off and are a great bunch of boys			1
‘ it can be difficult for them at times because it ’s been on the front page of the paper for the last three years - more , sadly , than it has been on the back			2
but there is nothing we can do about that			2
all we can do is give the supporters something to cheer about and that ’s via results on the park			0
’ after the dismal 1 - 1 home draw with @entity56 , @entity0 is likely to face further calls for his head if @entity6 stretch their lead at the top , but he claimed to be savouring a trip to @entity12			1
‘ outside @entity8 it ’s probably my favourite ground in the country			1
the atmosphere is as good as anywhere , ’ he said			0
‘ if we get the result it ’s a great win for us and that ’s all we are thinking about			0
’ rangers were held to a 1 - 1 draw against @entity56 at @entity8 on saturday @entity2 players put their hands to their heads in frustration as @entity76 ( second left ) misses a chance warning once again that a @entity78 semi-final with @entity80 is secondary to promotion , @entity0 added : ‘ we have absolutely got to put the semi-final on the backburner			1
you probably wo n’t believe i am saying this , but that semi-final against @entity80 is secondary to us getting out of the division			1
’ meanwhile , the war of words between businessman king and the @entity8 hierarchy continued last night			1
@entity2 chairman @entity92 has claimed @entity19 ’s failure to provide proof of funds and identify members of his consortium had made it impossible to accept his offer of investment in the club			1
@entity19 subsequently claimed proof of funds was available ‘ immediately ’ but that @entity103 , chairman of the @entity2 football board , had agreed the information could be provided once the backing of shareholders was confirmed			2
captain @entity109 ( right ) celebrates after opening the scoring for @entity2 against @entity56 @entity56 's @entity111 ( left ) slots it home to score his side 's equalising goal this was denied by @entity115 last night in a statement which read : ‘ i am 100 per cent supportive of the stance taken by @entity92			1
@entity92 had a legal and regulatory duty to determine the legitimacy of mr @entity19 ’s offer			0
any suggestion on mr @entity19 ’s part that i had agreed that these contentious issues could be dealt with after an acceptance of his bid are inaccurate and misleading			0
‘ the suggestion that mr @entity19 could not proceed further because my shareholding and proxies would have blocked his bid is a nonsense			0
for a bid to be rejected it has to be received first			0
i can only conclude mr @entity19 ’s phantom bid was designed as a vehicle for self - promotion of some kind			2
unfortunately the consequences of his inaccurate and ill - advised statement serves further to destabilise the club and upsets the fan base at this very sensitive time			0
i have grown tired of mr @entity19 ’s antics			0
’ tempers flared between @entity56 's @entity142 ( left ) amd @entity143 as the pair square up to one another @entity56 celebrate at full - time after picking up a vital point against @entity2 @entity147 also released a statement revealing he wanted @entity8 given legal protection as part of his £ 3m loan offer			1
the @entity154 owner ’s proposal was turned down by the board , with @entity156 claiming they opted for a £ 2m loan from @entity158 because he wanted less interest and security in return			2
@entity163 ’ words have now prompted @entity147 to detail the rival nine - point terms he put forward with his money last month			0
those included a request for ‘ @entity8 to be protected in a @entity168 or a similar legal mechanism that would allow this asset to be used solely for @entity171 in whatever legal entity to play football in perpetuity			2
’ @entity147 also wanted former director @entity175 appointed to the plc board for 24 months - and the right to appoint an administrator if @entity2 tipped into another insolvency			2
@entity147 was requesting a three per cent interest rate but it ’s understood he was willing to negotiate this down towards zero			0
@entity2 manager @entity0 ( left ) shakes hand with @entity56 manager @entity183 prior to kick - off he added : ‘ the loan ( of which £ 1m had been provided by mr @entity185 ) was designed to give the @entity186 the time needed to pursue @entity19 ’s offer and / or a new share issue in order to ensure long term financial security for the business			1
‘ furthermore the appointment of @entity175 would provide much needed harmony between the @entity186 and the supporters			0
‘ i was informed by mr @entity92 the @entity186 had no objections to any of these terms			0
he later informed me he had made the decision to go with mr @entity158 ’ s offer after consultation with the major shareholders			0
