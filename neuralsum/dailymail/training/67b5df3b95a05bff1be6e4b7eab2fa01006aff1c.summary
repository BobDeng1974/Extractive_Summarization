are you dreaming of a white @entity1 ? if so , this map may - or may not - be the answer to your wishes			1
according to the @entity14 graphic , residents of @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity11 of @entity12 are likely to see snowfall on december 25			1
meanwhile , those in the bottom half of the lower 48 states , including @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , have a significantly lower chance of experiencing a white @entity1			1
it is based on ' climate normals ' from @entity14 's @entity39 , from 1981 to 2010			0
dark gray shows the states where the probability of a white @entity1 is less than 10 per cent , blue depicts where chance is around 50 per cent , and white shows probabilities higher than 90 percent			1
according to the graphic , @entity44 , @entity45 , is one of only around a dozen locations in the @entity49 boasting a 100 per cent historical probability of seeing snowfall on december 25			0
winter : this graphic , also by @entity14 , shows snow depth across the @entity36 today ( sunday , december 14 ) @entity55 : this @entity14 satellite image , taken on saturday , shows an area of low pressure over the @entity59			0
@entity55 is shortly expected to move across @entity60 and @entity9 - and could stick around for @entity1 unsurprisingly , the @entity61 or the @entity62 are also expected to see the white stuff			2
despite the predictions , there is always the chance that the weather will take a surprising turn , potentially resulting in a white @entity1 for areas that do not expect it			2
in 2004 , a snowstorm on @entity72 brought the first white @entity1 in 50 years to @entity73 , and the first one ever recorded to @entity75 , @entity19			1
meanwhile , the @entity77 winter storm of 1989 brought snow to a number of unsuspecting cities , including @entity81 and @entity82 , on christmas day			0
@entity55 : @entity83 uses a snowblower to clear snow along @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity12 on thursday			0
the state 's @entity11 are likely to see snowfall on december 25 , the map reveals hazardous conditions : @entity92 cleans snow from his vehicle after several inches fell in @entity96 , @entity97 , on thursday following a severe storm			0
parts of the state could see a white @entity1 this year			2

@entity102 measures historic probability of states having a white @entity1
shows residents of @entity7 and @entity8 will likely see snow
so will those in @entity9 and the @entity11 of @entity12
meanwhile , those in bottom half of lower 48 states have lower chance
these include @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23
