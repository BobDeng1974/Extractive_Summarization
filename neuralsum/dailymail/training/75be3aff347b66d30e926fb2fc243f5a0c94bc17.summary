by @entity0 these eerie images were taken inside an abandoned arms factory used in @entity3 to make mustard gas and help develop the atomic bomb			1
hidden away in rural @entity7 , @entity6 is the only site of its type that was not discovered by @entity11 intelligence			1
it is thought that the site was almost impossible to see from the air because of its proximity to woodland , so it escaped the wrath of @entity19 's bombers			1
in the 1950s @entity20 relinquished its chemical weapons capability and the site was used by various governmental departments for storage until it closed in 1994			2
but the site still has many items from when it was in operation , such as a worker 's jacket - with a pack of cigarettes still inside the pocket - found hanging among the ancient machines			1
workers were churning out 40,000 mustard gas shells - a deadly chemical weapon - every week in november 1942 photographer @entity47 , from @entity48 , uncovered numerous artefacts as he explored the abandoned site , including a cabinet of old documents detailing the site 's layout and specific building requirements			1
' it was an incredible place to be			2
you could feel the history surrounding you , especially when you see documents and old items of clothing , ' said mr @entity47 , 24			0
' i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the jacket hanging up , i took it outside so i could photograph it in the light and that 's when i felt the pack of cigarettes in the pocket			0
' it really brought the place to life , i think all history students should get up close and personal with their subject like i did			0
' echoes of history : an old pack of cigarettes in a jacket pocket at the abandoned chemical weapons factory			0
the buildings are strewn with relics from the site 's heyday an old jacket hangs among the machinery			0
the plant was built in 1939 , the outset of the @entity3 , by the @entity20 government at the cost of £ 546,000 clandestine : the well - hidden site was the only facility if its type to escape detection by the @entity100 military machine			1
cover from surrounding woodland and its valley location helped keep it safe the building used for the a-bomb and some of other buildings are now @entity108 listed			1
the valley itself is in a u-shape and extremely narrow so easily missed from the sky mustard gas is a chemical weapon that causes large blisters wherever it contacts the skin			1
it was especially deadly as it can penetrate clothing , so it is not only the exposed skin of victims that gets burned			1
if the victim 's eyes were exposed it can result in temporary blindness and if inhaled , it causes bleeding and blistering within the lungs			0
it was fired at troops using artillery shells and bombs			1
a @entity20 nurse treating soldiers with mustard gas burns during the @entity136 described the horrific effects			1
she said : ' they can not be bandaged or touched			0
we cover them with a tent of propped - up sheets			1
gas burns must be agonising because usually the other cases do not complain , even with the worst wounds , but gas cases are invariably beyond endurance and they can not help crying out			1
' on august 27th 1939 , the @entity148 approved the £ 546,000 development of the top secret chemical weapons plant and by november 1942 workers were manufacturing 40,000 25lb mustard gas shells every week			1
and between 1942 and 1944 scientists there worked on ways of producing the enriched uranium necessary for the atomic bomb			1
some went on to be involved with the @entity159 ; the @entity161 's race to build an atomic bomb before @entity100 and @entity163			1
workers who handled mustard gas , a chemical weapon that causes large blisters to exposed skin and lungs , had to strip completely on arrival to work			1
one worker recalled : ' once we 'd stripped off , we were given a bath towel to walk into the department , where you put the work 's clothing on			1
' the last known person alive to have worked on the site is @entity181 , who in march 2010 gave a television interview in which she described her role as a weapons inspector			2
she told the @entity185 : ' the bombs were laid out for us to inspect			0
we had to pass them , to make sure they were n't damaged in any way			0
we checked they were n't leaking before they were sent through to be packed			0
' we knew you could n't have any leaks			0
you only needed a little spot and you 'd be burned			0
' people in the air force were going to handle them after us so we had to be sure there was nothing wrong with them when they went out			0
' the site was an excellent location because of the @entity203 , which was extensively canalised along with a rail network that was established using the mainlines of @entity206 and @entity207			2
sinister purpose : the rusting and forgotten machines			0
from 1942 the plant worked on ways of enriching uranium - a key component of the atomic bomb warning : a sign at the entrance to one of the large hanger - like buildings on the site			1
workers handled mustard gas , a chemical weapon that causes large blisters to exposed skin and lungs horror : mustard gas is a debilitating and potentially fatal gas weapon , used to infamous effect extensively in the first world war a worker who handled the mustard gas weapons and checked them for leaks was interviewed about her vital role			1

' it was an incredible place to be			0
you could feel the history surrounding you , especially when you see documents and old items of clothing , ' said mr @entity47 , 24 ' that ( a-bomb ) building was enormous inside and pitch - black			2
it was terrifying , because it was bat - infested and whilst moving around in the dark all i could hear were the loud echoes of scurrying feet , ' said mr @entity47 an old picture showing the site when it was operational			2
a tunnel labyrinth was built beneath the site with the aim of being able to store 1,500 tonnes of charged weapons and have complete safety from enemy bombing			0

workers at @entity6 manufactured mustard gas and worked on ways to develop uranium
it escaped detection from @entity319 thanks to cover from nearby woodland and its location in a valley
it was manufacturing 40,000 deadly mustard gas shells a week by november 1942
some scientists based there went on to work on @entity159 - the first nuclear weapon
