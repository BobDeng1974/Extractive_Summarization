by @entity1 reporter published : 22:51 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 22:52 est , 6 december 2013 two @entity3 men previously believed to have been ‘ cured ’ of @entity4 are showing traces of the virus in their blood			1
researchers said the fact that the two men were showing signs of the virus means that it can lurk in places in the body where it is hard to find			1
dr. @entity16 , associate professor of infectious diseases at @entity18 in @entity3 , announced the resurgence of the virus at an international conference on @entity22 in @entity23 on thursday , according to the @entity24			0
not cured : researcher @entity16 , who said in july that the men were cured of @entity4 , said on thursday that traces of the virus had been found again he said the findings suggest that they need to look for the virus in other tissues , such as the liver , gut and brain			1
‘ these are all potential sources , but it ’s very difficult to obtain tissue from these places so we do n’t do that routinely			0
’ the two , unnamed , @entity4 - positive men made headlines in july , when @entity16 announced that they were no longer showing any detectable traces of @entity4 in their body			1
the patients had received stem cell transplants after they had been diagnosed with @entity46 ’s lymphoma , a type of blood cancer , and doctors believed this transplant had allowed their body to get rid of the virus			1
they had stopped taking antiretroviral medications for 15 weeks and seven weeks respectively at the time of the announcement			0
the second patient decided to stay off the medication , but eight months after he had been ‘ cured ’ the doctors found traces of @entity4			2
he was placed on antiretrovirals again			0
hiding : this is an electron microscope image of an @entity4 - infected cell			2
researchers say the new findings could mean the virus hides in harder - to - reach areas of the body , such as gut , liver or brain tissue stem cells : the men had received stem cell transplants for @entity46 's lymphoma , a type of blood cancer , and doctors believed at the time this transplant had allowed their body to get rid of the virus according to government estimates , about 1,148,200 persons 13 and older were infected with @entity4 in the @entity81 in 2009			1
around 18.1 per cent of those people had not been diagnosed yet			0
another man , @entity83 , known as the ' @entity85 patient ' , similarly announced that he had been cured of @entity4 when he received a stem cell transplant			1
@entity83 , who had leukemia , received a donation from a person with a genetic mutation called @entity91 , which makes people @entity4 - resistant			2
@entity93 said in july 2012 that they found traces of @entity4 in @entity83 ’s blood , but he claimed those viruses are dead and can not replicate , according to @entity98			2
' cured ' : @entity83 , who had leukemia , claims he was cured after he got a stem cell transplant resistant dna : @entity83 received a donation from a person with a genetic mutation called @entity91 , which makes people @entity4 - resistant the @entity3 men 's stem cell donors did not have the @entity108			1
a @entity110 baby born hiv - positive was also determined to be cured of the virus after she was given powerful three - drug infusion within 30 hours after birth			1
the mother had not been diagnosed with @entity4 until she was in labor , and did not receive any prenatal treatments to prevent the spread of the virus to her baby			0
researchers said in october the baby still appears to be @entity4 - free			0
@entity16 said that despite the failure to eradicate @entity4 from the two men , researchers learned a lot that would allow them to make improvements for future treatments			0
‘ we go back to the drawing board , ’ @entity16 said			0
‘ it ’s exciting science , even if it ’s not the outcome we would have liked			0

researchers said the discovery means the virus can lurk in other , ' difficult to obtain ' , tissues , such as the liver , gut and brain
the two hiv - positive men made headlines in july , when researchers announced they were no longer showing any detectable traces of @entity4 in their body
they had received stem cell transplants for their @entity46 ’s lymphoma , a type of blood cancer
doctors believed this transplant had allowed their body to get rid of the virus
