by @entity0 they say that the property market is all about ' location , location , location ' - and this modest bungalow could prove the saying right			2
not only did the small house sell for an extraordinary £ 1.5million , but when it was demolished the empty plot went back on the market for double the price			1
but in the so - called ' @entity11 ' of @entity12 , @entity13 , £ 3million is considered a perfectly reasonable price to pay for an tiny patch of scrubland - as long as it comes with planning permission attached			1
sold : this bungalow was bought for £ 1.5million before being promptly demolished by the buyer gone : the one - acre plot is now standing completely empty - but it is set to sell for £ 3million because it has planning permission attached replacement : architects ' plans show how the space will be filled by a modernist five - bedroom home worth £ 5million close - up : the house is set to include five en - suite bedrooms , a home cinema and a gym @entity33 , where the house is located , is the fourth most expensive place in the world for residential property and ' blank canvas ' plots like this one are hugely sought - after			1
it would cost up to £ 1million pounds to build the three - storey home from plan , and when it is complete the five - bedroom property will have a market value of £ 5million			1
the land is likely to be bought by a developer - or a millionaire with the time and money to build their dream home			2
alternatively , the estate agents are marketing the property as a ' turnkey ' proposition where a buyer can pay £ 5million pounds and move straight into the house after it is built			1
work in progress : the site is currently boarded off but is nonetheless on the market for £ 3million @entity63 : in the bizarre world of the @entity12 property market , empty plots can be more valuable than actual houses potential : the plot 's value comes from its strategic position overlooking the sea in the exclusive resort the site is in a small @entity74 called @entity75 , where until recently @entity77 cricket legend @entity76 owned a house			1
it overlooks @entity33 , enjoys direct access to the waters and even has its own private beach			0
it is just around the corner from football manager @entity86 's house			2
the house that was demolished was a three - bedroom bungalow dating back to the 1920s that neighbours said was in a ' good state of repair			1
' it was built in the 1920s			0
the @entity75 contains nine properties , all of which directly back on to @entity33 , but only one of them has so far been redeveloped into a modern , luxury home to match the profile of the area 's new ultra-rich residents			1
@entity102 : the open - plan living space envisaged for the home will give excellent views of @entity33 entrance : the modern design is in stark contrast to the traditional ambience seen before night - time : an artist 's impression of how the home will look after dark estate agents tailor made describe the land sale as a ' superb opportunity to build your own bespoke beachside home on the world renowned @entity12 peninsula			1
' @entity121 , of tailor made , said @entity12 is a unique location where ' blank canvas ' sites are more attractive and valuable than the house already on them			0
' we are in an area where residental properties are very much viewed for their plot value , ' he said			0
' it is about the potential of the plot rather than what is already on it			0
' knocking a house down and getting planning permission for a new one gives the property a much greater value than before , no matter how old or new the house			1
desirable : it is the position of the house on the edge of @entity33 which explains its inflated price tag looking out : the view from the beach out over the harbour satellite : this image shows the bungalow located near the beach in @entity12 ' if you have the money , you can build your dream home in one of the best locations that there is			2
' the market here is moving at a real pace			0
we have just sold a property for the equivalent of £ 1,250 per square foot , which is a record			0
' @entity165 have approved plans for a brand new house with five en - suite bedrooms , open plan living space , a home cinema and a gymnasium			0
outside there is room for a double garage , a boat store , four mooring spaces and a rear terrace with spectacular harbour views			0
plan : a diagram showing the layout of the house , including the home cinema where the lucky buyer can relax @entity12 ' popularity is attributed to its seclusion , perched on a peninsula at the mouth of @entity33 near @entity189			2
every home in the community is within just a few minutes ' walk of the beach , with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the @entity197			0
the property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years , with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting - edge new properties to meet demand			0
last year , 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £ 80million as @entity12 ' reputation has continued to grow			0
£ 3million can get you nothing more than an empty lot in the ultra-exclusive resort of @entity12 in @entity13			1
but elsewhere , that sum could get you a lot further - for £ 3million you could buy a @entity213 mansion , a @entity215 townhouse , a @entity217 painting or the world 's most expensive car			2
town house : this home near @entity215 's @entity222 became @entity224 's most expensive council house when it was sold for £ 3million ; it was subsequently taken over by squatters @entity213 mansion : the @entity228 estate in @entity229 , @entity230 , was bought by record lottery winner @entity232 and @entity233 for £ 3million , having previously been run as a hotel masterpiece : @entity236 , a 1961 portrait of @entity238 by @entity217 which the artist considered one of his greatest works , was bought at auction last month for just under £ 3million sports car : the @entity244 is the most expensive car ever built , with a sticker price of £ 2.8million ; only three were ever produced , and each one found a buyer			1

1920s three - bedroom home was bought for £ 1.5million only to be promptly demolished by a property developer
the plot in @entity12 , @entity13 has planning permission for a luxury five - bedroom home and is on sale for £ 3million
alternatively , the buyer can pay £ 5million if they are willing to wait for the modern house to be completed
