a shadowy figure constantly by the star 's side , @entity7 's mother @entity57 would eventually file a restraining order against @entity0			1
in the order , @entity38 said her daughter met @entity0 in october 2007 , and that he ' essentially moved into @entity7 's home and has purported to take control of her life , home and finances			2
' she described witnessing a situation of tight control and manipulation , with @entity0 calling the shots on her medications , cutting her phone lines , and deciding who could see the pop star			1
. @entity0 would go on to work with singer @entity74 , who sings his praises , and told @entity8 that he first heard from @entity5 before a court ordered her parents to take over her conservatorship in august last year			1
he said : ' we remained in contact ever since			0
she was curious about the @entity7 situation			0
i figured that deep down in her mind that she felt she may have needed some help			2
and that 's why i feel she called me			0
' and then i got a call in mid-september , she said she was back in @entity11 and she wanted help in finding a manager and a lawyer			2
i asked her to please ' call your parents , talk to your counselor '			2
and that 's when she informed me that the conservatorship was over			0
it sounded like she was doing well from the initial call			0
but subsequent calls proved otherwise			0
but i still advised her to stay in contact with her parents and counselors first and foremost			0
' a source revealed that @entity5 actually changed her cell phone number and stopped calling her distraught parents , who became ' extremely concerned ' after she arrived in @entity11 and displayed erratic behavior that included her being accused of shoplifting			1
she was also accused of trying to steal a hat from high end store @entity112 , although charges were not filed			0

the actress is believed to receiving help there as people stated , if @entity5 wo n't accept treatment voluntarily and is ruled unable to care for herself , her doctors could choose to ask for an @entity164 conservatorship , a one - year psychiatric hold they likely plan to request that in the coming days			1
@entity5 and her current treating psychiatrist would have to appear in the @entity10 @entity167 for this type of conservatorship ( @entity164 is short for @entity170 ) to go into place			1
the source told @entity8 : ' the psychiatric hold is unfortunate , but a good thing for @entity5 , because if she is properly diagnosed and if she is put on the right medications and undergoes therapy this will help			1
it 's not her fault , it really is a disease			0

' it can be the @entity282 office , it could be a private professional conservator that 's licensed and bonded by the state of @entity156 , or it could be a family friend			0

it also allows the conservator to enforce compliance with any psychiatric medicines prescribed to her by her doctor			0
