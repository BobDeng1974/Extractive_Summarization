the contrast could not have been clearer as @entity13 and his team cruised by @entity16 ’s golden sands in a team bus guarded by two police cars , a police motorcycle outrider , an army jeep and a truck - load of troops armed to the teeth			1

’ @entity2 players laboured in the heat of their one - hour session at @entity52			1

i ’ve been kicked many times and carried on			0
’ @entity213 was simply delighted to be involved after he turned up late			0
the bus had already left the team hotel when they noticed @entity213 was missing and they caused chaos in the street turning the coach around			0
when he finally climbed aboard he was greeted with a sarcastic cheer and the team made the journey in 39 minutes with the help of their military convoy			2
@entity227 - faced : @entity213 nearly missed the bus to @entity2 training on the return : @entity231 is working his way back to full fitness better signs for @entity13 came in the shape of @entity231 , who had further treatment on his injured knee before going through a light running and jogging session , carefully monitored by physios @entity240 and @entity242			1
@entity231 , wearing a heavy knee brace as he worked , started with some short dashes , not at full throttle , and finished with a few laps of the pitch			1
@entity13 has until friday to make up his mind on whether to keep him in the squad but the progress appears to be encouraging			0
some of the players , including @entity253 , @entity107 , @entity254 and @entity213 were still out doing shooting practice when @entity13 came out and ordered them off			2
