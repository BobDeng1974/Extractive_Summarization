as @entity2 prepares to pull on an @entity4 shirt for the 100th time , @entity1 writers provide their memories of the striker from his time representing the @entity4 ... @entity9 the first day of march , 2006 , was unusually wintry , even for @entity10			1
@entity4 were playing @entity11 in a friendly at @entity13			1
there was a dusting of snow during the match , followed by a heavy fall as it ended in a 2 - 1 victory for @entity4			1
the snow was several inches deep as i trudged through the @entity13 , head down against the storm			2
a snowball hit me in the chest			2
i looked up to see young @entity2 , laughing			1
then he said : ' hello , mr @entity28			2
help me deal with these lads			2
' he was engaged in a snowball fight			0
a friendly one , even though this was @entity13 , the kids were @entity10 fans and he was a former @entity35 player who had become a superstar with @entity37			0
@entity2 pictured during the line up ahead of @entity4 's game against @entity11 in 2006 at @entity13 @entity4 won 2 - 1 and @entity40 had a laugh with fans and @entity1 's @entity28 afterwards in @entity10 i joined in , shoulder to shoulder with @entity2 , until both of us and the group of boys were smothered in snow			1
there was more laughter as the lads shouted their thanks and scurried off through the dim yellow light cast by the old lamp posts			0
as i picked up my briefcase , @entity40 asked : ‘ where you heading ? ’ ‘ driving back to @entity58			1
’ ‘ where you parked ? ’ ‘ up there in a side street			0
’ ‘ i ’ll walk with you			0
ca n’t be too safe this time of night			0
’ and so he did , as we chuckled about the snowballs			0
it had n’t been his best of nights in an @entity4 shirt			1
he had been substituted in the 64th minute , before @entity68 and @entity69 scored the goals which won the game			2
still he took time out to delight that group of fans and josh with me			0
still he was one of the lads			0
as he says , if he had n’t made it as a footballer he would be out there with them on cold nights			0
behind the goal rather than shooting into it			2
those who would knock @entity4 ’s best player might think on that as he collects his 100th cap at @entity87 this saturday			1
raise a glass , even			0
@entity40 tries to tackle @entity90 at @entity13 as @entity4 went on to beat @entity11 2 - 1 in @entity91 @entity92 it is sad i ’ve never felt more excited about @entity40 than watching him on his first competitive start for @entity4 against @entity97 at the @entity98 in 2003			1
the @entity101 semi-finalists could n’t get near him			0
you left feeling as though the last piece of the jigsaw had been completed in the puzzle of the golden generation			0
@entity40 pictured during the 2003 match at the @entity98 between @entity4 and @entity97 @entity108 opportunities to understand @entity40 have been rare , and interviews brief , usually lit up by a flash of meaning in his blue - eyed stare rather than his words			1
after a brilliant qualifying campaign for the @entity101 in 2010 he went to @entity118 with @entity119 comparing him to @entity120 and @entity121 and yet his public communications of note amounted to an abusive rant at a tv camera after the bore draw with @entity127			0
he has begun to reveal a little more since he became captain , but the fondest memories have been his flashes of brilliance on the pitch , in particular the goal against @entity134 last year			1
he was wearing a protective headguard after clashing with @entity136 in training — it had come off and he headed the ball in anyway			0
@entity40 , pictured wearing his headguard for @entity4 , during a game he scored against @entity134 in 2013 @entity141 on the pitch ? at @entity144 , he was dazzling			1
off it ? at the 2006 @entity101 , @entity40 was the most charming of the @entity146 ; always very polite			2
@entity40 has been described as the most charming of the wags by @entity1 's @entity148 @entity149 i was sitting on the bike in the gym at a hotel in @entity154 at the 2006 @entity101 when @entity40 ’s then - girlfriend @entity40 walked in			1
noticing that a few people on the exercise machines had run out of water she went over to the dispenser and brought several cups back for those working out			2
@entity40 has proved one of the better wags after helping those in the gym in @entity154 in 2006 @entity166 the build - up to the 2006 @entity101 was dominated by a stand - off between @entity40 and @entity4 following a metatarsal injury			1
when he returned to @entity154 after being cleared to play , he commented : ‘ the big man is back in town			2
’ when @entity40 returned to @entity154 after being cleared to play , he said : ‘ the big man is back in town ’ @entity174 @entity2 seemed happiest training with @entity4 the day before a game ; always joking and laughing			1
but when it comes to football , he ’s always committed			0
he ’s undoubtedly the hardest tackler in training			0
some of his challenges take your breath away ! @entity2 seemed happiest training with @entity4 the day before a game - always joking and laughing but the @entity4 striker holds nothing back in training and has a reputation as one of the toughest tacklers @entity189 hails ' special ' skipper @entity40			1
