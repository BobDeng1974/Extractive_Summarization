by @entity0 a @entity2 woman has revealed that she spent nearly a year eating free rotisserie chickens from area @entity5 grocery stores by taking advantage of a store policy promising all sales be priced as advertised or taken off the bill			1
@entity10 , a 57 - year - old who designs stripper costumes , first demanded the so - called ' @entity5 promise ' after realizing many of the stores birds did n't meet the listed 2 - pound minimum weight			1
a year and 300 free chickens later , the @entity18 woman portrays herself as a sort of @entity21 of poultry			1
' i right the wrong			0
' but @entity10 never had to steal from anyone and gave most of meat , not to the poor , but to homeless dogs and cats she works with at local rescue organizations			1
@entity10 's oddball hobby began one day as she shopped at a @entity5 and noticed some scrawny chickens			1
she actually weighed one over in the produce department and found it was under the two - pound minimum			2
she checked out , but thought better of it			0
she took the issue to the manager and was promptly refunded her $ 7.59			0
when @entity10 tried her trick again , it worked just the same			1
it also worked every time thereafter			0
and it only got easier			0
' i could do it blindfolded , ' she told the @entity65			0

to right the wrong , @entity10 made up her mind to take her biggest haul ever			2
she went out into the shopping plaza - filled stretches of @entity85 and hit up 11 @entity5 stores for a grand total of 47 chickens			1
she then took her story , and the mouth - watering evidence , to the @entity43			0
' @entity5 delis have been informed to weigh rotisserie chickens that seem underweight and price them appropriately , or use those chickens in other deli recipes , ' @entity5 spokeswoman @entity92 told the @entity43 in response			2
according to @entity92 , @entity5 chicken suppliers were sending them underweight birds because of a terribly cold winter and the resulting puny poultry			2
thanks to @entity10 , @entity5 has now promised to rectify the issue			2
' you ca n’t ever stay silent , ' she said			0
' everybody ’s got to speak up , even if it ’s about chickens			0
