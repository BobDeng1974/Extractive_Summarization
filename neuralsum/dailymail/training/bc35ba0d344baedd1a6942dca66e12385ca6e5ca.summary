“ his death and its consequences have had , and will continue to have , a devastating effect on your parents and those close to you			1
“ you grew up with your brother and from time to time worked with him in the building trade			0
when you were both sober , it seems you got on well			0
“ but when each of you had too much alcohol , there was a risk an argument might break out leading to violence			0
that had happened before and it happened on @entity4			0
“ on @entity4 you and he were drinking in the kitchen of your parents ’ home			1
it ’s unlikely that violence was on your mind or your brother ’s mind when you started drinking			0
“ from 6pm to 8pm , it ’s gathered from the record of text messages that all was well			0
“ however , as soon as you both drank more , it seems that you feared a fight might break out			2
distressing : the twins ' parents @entity80 and @entity81 , pictured outside court , called 999 for help “ then an argument and a fight broke out , quite why is not known , but it did			1
“ whether you picked up a kitchen knife from the worktop or your brother did is also not clear but what is clear is that you ended up with the knife in your hand and you stabbed your brother in the abdomen , causing a fatal wound			1
” the court heard that @entity7 had served previous prison sentences for offences of battery and affray relating to domestic incidents involving his former partners			1

mr @entity119 said mrs @entity111 dialled 999 to ask for police assistance and during the call , which was played to the jury , her husband called out to his wife asking for an ambulance before he shouted : “ he ’s stabbed him			2
” the jury was shown photographs of the kitchen , which showed several crushed empty cans of @entity131 lager alongside party food			1
mr @entity119 said the defendant fled the property barefoot and called his girlfriend , who took him to a friend ’s party where he continued to get drunk			1
he said : “ this is a tragic case			0

“ the incident which led to @entity8 ’s death occurred in the kitchen of the family home in @entity22 , where both their mother and father were present in the house			1
“ in a nutshell , it was @entity4 last year , both brothers had been drinking , shortly before 9pm an argument started between the two brothers			2
“ that argument appears to have turned into a tussle , punches may have been exchanged , at some point this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother @entity8			1
guilty : @entity7 ( left ) had denied killing @entity8 ( right ) deliberately , insisting he was acting in self - defence argument : the row escalated and @entity8 was left bleeding to death on the floor of the kitchen ( pictured ) “ having done so , the defendant fled the family home			1
he did n’t even stop to take the time to put on a pair of shoes before he left the house			2
“ he telephoned his girlfriend , who picked him up in her car and took him to a friend ’s house where a @entity4 was in full swing			2
“ the defendant turned off his mobile phone which meant that he could not be contacted by the police			0
fight : the pair chatted in a friendly way at this table but the talk became heated as the night wore on “ he stayed at that @entity4 until the police traced him to that address and he was arrested on suspicion of murder			2
by then he was very drunk			0
” mr @entity119 said that @entity7 inflicted a single stab wound to his brother ’s lower stomach which was about seven inches deep			1
he said the defendant told police he had acted in self - defence			2

mr @entity119 said a blood test showed that @entity8 had 230mg of alcohol in 80ml of blood - almost three times the drink - drive limit - and @entity7 told police he had drunk six cans of lager and two glasses of red wine before leaving the house			1
he also told police that he had a “ fiery relationship ” with his brother and drink could make him “ nasty ” and “ short - tempered ”			2
@entity7 insisted he acted only in self - defence , but yesterday the jury of nine men and three women took 16 hours to find him guilty of murder			1
he showed no emotion in the dock at @entity12 , where the verdict was met with a cry from the public gallery			0
