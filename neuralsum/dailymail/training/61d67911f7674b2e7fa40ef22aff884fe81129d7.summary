photoshopping an image may seem like a modern phenomenon , but the idea of making quick edits to images dates all the way back to the 1940s			0
created 68 years ago , a contraption known as @entity9 ’s @entity8 was the precursor to current photo - editing tools and involves a retouching pencil and a magnifying glass			1

the negative is placed on top of the green cloth in the centre of the device and pictures are backlit by a fluorescent tube inside the machine instead of uploading images to a computer , photographers would place their negative under the magnifying glass			1
blemishes in the picture could then be smoothed out by using the retouching pencil , assisted by gentle vibrations of the machine			2

mr @entity21 filed a patent for the device in march 1946 and it was awarded in june 1947			2
the filing said : ' this invention relates to a device for use in retouching photographs			0
' photographic retouching is done by highly skilled operators who work over the blemish spots on a negative with a retouching pencil			2
' [ this ] consists of a plurality of microscopic , overlapping check marks or loops which must be so small and so uniform that they will not become apparent on an enlarged print from the negative			0
' the principal object of this invention is to provide means for automatically forming these small , microscopic check marks so that retouching will require less skill and less time			0
' mr @entity64 said : ‘ the hardest part when restoring the machine was the amount of dirt and filth			0
‘ i spent a few hours just removing crud from all over			0
' although afterwards , it still looked like it had been in someone 's basement for 50 years			0
‘ the wiring was all really well done and fired up right away			0
' the only thing was the light was busted , and so i had to buy a new one			0
' mr @entity64 attempted to use the machine , but admitted he was unable to master the technique required to produce a picture perfect photo			0
after restoring the @entity9 's @entity20 , mr @entity64 sold the device ( pictured ) to a collector in @entity157 for an undisclosed fee @entity159 ( @entity160 app pictured ) is a software used to make edits and add filters to digital photographs ‘ only speciality retouchers had this machine , and photographers would often outsource this because the process could take up to six hours			1
‘ i am not sure how popular it was because only retouchers would have it , hence the lack of information that we have to this day			0
’ mr @entity64 attempted to use the machine , but admitted he was unable to master the technique required to produce a picture perfect photo			0
‘ i tried to use the machine myself but i just ended up ruining the negatives and scratching them			2
‘ i did not have the right pencil to do the job , plus my hands are n't steady enough for it , it seems like you have to be quite surgical with this machine			2
’ after restoring the @entity9 's @entity20 , mr @entity64 decided to sell the device , a a collector in @entity157 for an undisclosed fee			1
‘ everyone thought i was a bit crazy when i bought the device			0

' however , i am not sure what he used it for			0
