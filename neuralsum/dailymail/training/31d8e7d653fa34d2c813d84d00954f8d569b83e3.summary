there ca n't be many levels of excitement that can be greater than three - year - old @entity3 's when he hears the opening strains of @entity8 ' famous @entity7 theme			1
purist fans of @entity11 's films will be delighted little @entity3 ' dad @entity12 , 33 , is introducing his son to the legendary science - fiction franchise starting with @entity15 , the original 1977 release			1
' was there any other option ? ' he says			0
but not as pleased as @entity18 - based @entity12 is that his young man has such fine taste			2
' what 's this dad ? ' asks @entity3 as the movie begins			2
asked what he thinks it is , @entity3 thinks for a moment before saying enthusiastically , ' @entity27 , and the people ! ' he 's so close to storm troopers we all know what he means , and @entity12 says the only reason he gets it wrong is ' i have n't corrected him on that one yet '			1
it 's so cute , who can blame him ? as the famous tune kicks into gear , @entity3 ' reaction escalates apace with arm waving and jumping , no doubt influenced by his dad 's mutual appreciation of what 's to come			2
' i like it ! ' he says			0
the look on the face of @entity3 when he sees the start of @entity7 : a @entity15 is priceless ' @entity50 , ' @entity3 proclaims - he only does n't say @entity51 because dad @entity12 has n't told him to ' is it exciting ? ' @entity12 asks , and gets a repeated response in the affirmative			1
' there 's a space ship ! ' @entity3 says , becoming increasingly excited			2
incredibly , @entity3 has n't even seen the whole film yet			0
' this was the first time , ' @entity12 says			0
' he has seen clips and trailers on @entity62 and his sister @entity63 has seen @entity15 , so he has seen bits of it whilst she was watching			0
he has n't made it through the whole film yet as his attention span ca n't last that long			0
' @entity3 jumps around and laughs with great enthusiasm as @entity8 ' famous score plays @entity3 is also a massive fan of the @entity72 films @entity73 and @entity74 but @entity12 says ' nothing else gets such a reaction ' as @entity15 , the first of six @entity78 films by @entity11 featuring the @entity80 - led @entity79 in their attempt to destroy the @entity82			1
but while @entity3 enjoys the @entity51 - sorry , @entity83 - he 's yet to be fully introduced to their evil leader @entity84			1
' he does n't seem that fazed by @entity84 but again he has n't seen much of @entity84 's antics yet and i 'm conscious of his age not to spook him too soon , ' @entity12 says .			0

three - year - old @entity3 is already massive @entity7 fan
@entity12 played him @entity15 and his reaction is priceless
@entity3 calls @entity51 ' @entity50 ' but only because his father is yet to correct him on the *difference*
