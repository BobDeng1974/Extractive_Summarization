scientists from the @entity1 are designing ultra-durable condoms they claim could feel even better than nothing at all			1
the contraceptive is made with hydrogel , a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue			1
the groundbreaking design will eventually offer functions like self - lubrication , topical drug delivery , and even electric conductivity , dramatically changing the capacity of male contraception , reports @entity14			1
scientists from the @entity1 are designing ultra-durable condoms they claim could feel even better than nothing at all the contraceptive is made with hydrogel , a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue the @entity19 team behind the design , led by materials scientist @entity21 , won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013 , giving them access to us $ 100,000 to use on research			1
' our original idea was just to try to prove that an original material could replace latex , ' mr @entity21 said			2
' we were starting from scratch , we had an idea that these new materials would have the same properties as rubber with a nicer feel , but we were n't sure if they had the right properties for a condom			2
' ' the early indications are that the materials are strong enough and actually do prevent against the transfer of small biological molecules , ' he said			0
@entity21 , the leader of the research team responsible for the design , said : ' if you make them so pleasurable that people ca n't wait to put them on , then more people will use them ' the team won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013 , giving them access to us $ 100,000 to use on research @entity54 has been around for decades , but it has risen to prominence in recent years , after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels			1
the researchers now plan to partner with @entity62 in @entity63 to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material			2
' we 'll be able to look at brain activity to see whether it really feels better than latex , ' said @entity21			0
' if you make them so pleasurable that people ca n't wait to put them on , then more people will use them , and we can hopefully stop the spread of disease			0
it 's as simple as that			0
' @entity54 ( pictured ) has been around for decades , but it has risen to prominence in recent years , after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels the researchers plan to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material @entity21 is hoping to design the product to accommodate for the around the cultural and social needs for birth control			1
' it 's a branding exercise as much as a scientific one , ' said @entity21			0
' a material alone ca n't change the way we look at sex , but we believe it can definitely help			0

the design comes from scientists at the @entity1
they won a us $ 100,000 grant for a next generation condom in 2013
it 's made from a strong and flexible material called hydrogel
the groundbreaking design can offer functions like self - lubrication
the scientists will run biometric tests to *maximise* the pleasurability
