by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 admitted he cut his @entity4 party short in order to immediately focus on adding to his major haul and completing the career grand slam at the @entity9 next spring			1
the 25 - year - old @entity10 became the third youngest player - after @entity12 and @entity13 - to win three majors and celebrated his glorious triumph at @entity16 in a @entity18 nightclub , followed by a champagne - fuelled session in @entity20 with old friends the following evening			1
but with the @entity23 held at @entity24 in just the second week of august , the last thing @entity2 wants is a hangover and by wednesday he was already enduring an intense fitness session at the @entity27 in @entity28			1
' that ’s an immense thing to aim for and i still ca n’t believe i ’ll be going in at 25 with a chance , ' @entity2 , who turns 26 next may , told @entity50			2
' for me it ’ll always be all about the majors			0
in the @entity12 era , their importance has become massive			0
they ’re the storyline , they ’re the narrative : " how many majors have you won ? " not " how many tournaments have you won ? "			0
despite his already burgeoning major haul , @entity2 has had a mercurial and at times turbulent career , but since breaking off his engagement to tennis star @entity66 in may he has won both the prestigious @entity67 at @entity68 and now @entity4			1

' and since the @entity83 , i ’ve won three in 14 majors			0
as everybody knows i ’ve had some up and downs in that time , but i would have taken that return			0
@entity89 , would i ? that ’s nearly one a year – and i can add up , you know			0
' pictures have emerged from last sunday night in @entity18 that suggest a wild party - friends and family were shown filling the @entity36 with @entity37 - but @entity2 admitted clubbing with his parents was ' a bit surreal and weird			1
' fine company : @entity2 is bidding to join @entity13 and @entity12 as winners of golf 's grand slam monday 's bash was a wilder one , with many bottles of champagne filling the famous old trophy as it was passed round a big table of friends to swill from			1
@entity2 admits that was the night he truly ' let my hair down			2
' but @entity2 insists the party is over for now while he chases sporting immortality			2
only @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity13 and @entity12 have achieved the grand slam , but @entity2 is already three quarters of the way there			1
