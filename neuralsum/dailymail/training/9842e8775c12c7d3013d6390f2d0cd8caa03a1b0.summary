by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 01:40 est , 5 august 2013 my landline rang			1
it was a sunday morning and i was surprised because i ’d given the number to only three people as i tended to use my mobile phone instead			2
‘ hello mr @entity0 , @entity7 here			1
’ that was the line with which my nightmare started			2
the person on the other end of the phone — @entity14 — told me there had been a number of fraudulent transactions on my bank account since midnight , adding up to about £ 1,100			1
what kind of fool ? @entity21 as mr @entity22 looking like he 'd hand his @entity7 card over to just about anybody i ’d never heard of @entity7 before , but then i ’d never had money stolen like this before			1
maybe this is what happens			2
@entity14 then confirmed the last genuine withdrawal i ’d made — at a @entity30 cashpoint in @entity31 , opposite @entity33 & @entity34 station			2
he then gave me a reference number and told me to ring the number on the back of my bank card			1
i did just that , quoted the reference number and spoke to someone who knew all about the supposed fraud			2
these cunning tricksters had apparently cloned my card at the atm i ’d used and then treated themselves to a few things in the @entity48 on @entity49			1
something did n’t ring true about the whole thing : why , for starters , would someone with a stolen bank card spend only £ 400 in the @entity48 ? but i watch enough consumer tv to know these things happen			1
the person helping me , @entity56 in @entity58 ’s card protection department , had my full name , date of birth and , crucially , my address			1
he said a courier was on the way to collect my bank card for further examination			1
initially i flinched , but when he explained they needed to analyse the chip , it seemed to make sense			2
after all , i ’d called the bank myself : this had to be genuine			1
and that is probably the same reason i typed my pin into the keypad of my phone when he asked			2
i packaged the card as requested — wrapped in kitchen roll , packed into an envelope so it did n’t look like a bank card — and waited for the courier			1
@entity56 called back twice : once to say the car was five minutes away and again to say it was outside , quoting the car ’s number plate and describing the driver			2
he called again later that afternoon to say they ’d received the card and that i ’d have my money back in a few days			1
‘ great , ’ i thought			0
so taken in was i by the efficiency of it all that i went through exactly the same process the following day when @entity7 called to say there was now a problem with my credit card			1
the fraudsters had somehow hacked into my online account , got my credit card details and maxed it out			1
stalked : police said mr @entity0 was watched by the fraudsters as he withdrew cash , and they followed him home to find out his address			1
these were vital pieces of information in making him trust them precautions : after being conned out of £ 5,500 , @entity0 has signed up to fraud prevention services good old @entity56 told me this time there was a shred of hope the criminals would be arrested as they ’d made the mistake of buying @entity115 tickets to @entity116 on a specific train			1
the police would be waiting for them at @entity120			0
amazing news ! a few days went by and @entity56 stopped calling			0
by then i was about £ 4,000 out of pocket , so i called the bank , this time from my mobile			1
after explaining the situation to two or three people , i heard the most chilling phrase of all : ‘ but mr @entity0 , your cards have n’t been reported stolen			1
’ i ’ve never been speechless before			0
i ’ve never been able to feel the colour drain from my face either			0
but now i was , and i did			0
why had i given my card to a stranger ? why had i typed my pin into the phone ? how did they know my landline number ? how did they know my mother ’s maiden name ? how did they have my address ? the police still have n’t been able to establish the answers to these last three questions , but say that such criminals are remarkably adept at gleaning personal information from the internet and the electoral roll			1
and , most infuriating of all , why had n’t i checked my balance before i even called the bank that sunday morning ? when i did check , things were far worse than i ’d expected			1
the @entity48 story was all a lie			0
in fact , they had spent thousands in clothes shops and , best of all , treated themselves to a @entity161 each evening			0
to cap it all off , my rent payment had bounced			0
by then , i was panicking			0
what if i did n’t get a refund ? the security expert at the bank said this was a possibility			1
it would take me years to pay off debt like this			0
i called the police , who put me onto their dedicated fraud line			0
after explaining my idiocy once again — it ’s pretty humbling , repeatedly telling people you ’re the type of person who gives your bank card and pin to the first person who asks for them — they went through the likely series of events that led to this theft			1
in the end , the total taken from my account was about £ 5,500			1
it all started , said the police , on the saturday night when one of this gang will have watched me take money from the cashpoint			2
that ’s details of my last transaction taken care of			2
the police then believe that i was followed home , which is how they got my address			0
my name and landline number they doubtless obtained with a bit of research online			0
as for the call , well , it ’s pretty clever			0
only the person who initiates a landline call can cut it off			0
if the person who receives the call puts down the receiver , it does n’t hang up			0
so , when i went to find my bank card , the fraudsters were still on the other end , waiting for me to pick up the phone and call ‘ the bank ’			1
as i did this , they first played a dial tone down the line and then a ring tone			0
‘ @entity56 ’ will have been sitting next to ‘ @entity14 ’ , the first person who called me , no doubt both laughing their heads off at how stupid i ’d been			0
i was right to praise the bank ’s efficiency , though			2
they got me all my money back within ten days , though i did have to get new bank accounts and cards			1
it was a pretty lean spell and by the time i got my money back , i ’d spent my last 60p on a tin of beans			2
my family and friends offered money , but i did n’t have a bank account for them to pay money into and there was a chance i had the sharp end of six grand to pay back , so i did n’t need to owe another £ 50 on top of that			1
the feeling of total financial ruin , of utter helplessness , is n’t one i ’ll forget in a hurry			0
setting up new direct debits was an unholy pain and even now , five months on , i ’m still having problems			0
my credit rating has taken a serious knock , while getting the various bank departments to talk to one another and not try to charge me a few hundred quid in overdraft charges was no picnic			2
i ’ve since had to sign up to a number of other bank schemes and government services to protect myself			1
i get a monthly statement of credit checks in my name , for example , so i ’ll know if these people are using the information they have on me			0
it took a few weeks to stop worrying about the same people coming back to my house , too , though spending hours online researching the link between bank fraud and violent crime — virtually non-existent — helped with that			2
out of everything , accepting that it had happened at all probably took the longest			0
i ’m still coming to terms with it , but i think being a bit more suspicious is n’t a bad thing			0
being paranoid , though ? well , hopefully that will just wear off in time			0
i like to think i ’m a tech - savvy , culturally aware person			0
i read about internet security			0
i know about phishing : criminals masquerading as a friend or business to dupe you into revealing your passwords or bank details			1
yet all that knowledge left me when it counted			2
financial fraud is often deemed a victimless crime because , ultimately , it ’s only huge companies footing the bill , not individuals			0
having suffered the stress , upset and countless hours spent sorting it out , i know it ’s anything but victimless .			0

fraudsters pretended to be working for @entity7 services
they said the bank card was cloned at an atm and money had been withdrawn
after providing a *convincing* level of knowledge *including* passwords and account details , @entity0 handed his card over for *inspection*
they then took £ 5,500 from his account with his card which was *n't* stolen int he first place
