@entity0 named six academy products on their bench with an average age of just 18 for their @entity5 victory at @entity6			1
three of them - @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity10 - got on to the field for the @entity12			1
here , @entity13 takes a look at how the youngsters performed during tuesday night 's 4 - 1 victory ... @entity17 watches on as his half - volley flies towards the @entity6 goal during the first half @entity7 ( 17 , midfielder , @entity22 ) - played 45 minutes minutes played : 45 @entity23 passes : 44 ( 40 completed ) pass completion rate : 90.9 per cent accurate forward - half passes : 15 forward - half pass completion : 83.3 per cent recoveries : 4 fouls : 1 the young @entity22 's introduction to this match came somewhat under the radar after he replaced @entity32 just before the half - time interval			1
however , he showed some promising glimpses during the second half			0
he looked composed on the ball , tidy in possession , as well as strong and physical			0
it appears he could slot into the team seamlessly in defensive midfield - having completed 90.9 per cent of his 44 passes during the second half			0
on saying that , the 17 - year - old could not have asked for a better game to be introduced into with it already done and dusted at 3 - 0 by the time he arrived on to the field			1
@entity7 ( right ) holds off the challenge of @entity6 's @entity48 on tuesday night this was @entity7 's second appearance for the @entity12 , although his first in the @entity5 , having come on as a substitute during the @entity54 tie with @entity55 in january			1
he is a @entity22 under 17 international , as well as being a regular in the @entity57 21 and @entity58 19 sides			0
@entity7 could well find himself as a consistent replacement for @entity0 in a position they are severely lacking in			2
@entity0 boss @entity63 ( left ) talks to @entity7 in training ahead of the match @entity9 ( 17 , winger , @entity68 ) - played 45 minutes minutes played : 45 @entity23 passes : 29 ( 27 completed ) pass completion rate : 93.1 per cent accurate forward - half passes : 8 forward - half pass completion : 80 per cent tackles : 3 fouls : 1 @entity9 came on at half - time for @entity17 to make his full professional debut having been an unused substitute in the defeat at @entity78 - and in the process he became their second - youngest ever representative in the @entity5			1
aged 17 years and 102 days , only @entity82 ( aged 16 years and 239 days when he made his debut ) has appeared at a younger age in @entity85 for the @entity12			2
unfortunately for the youngster , @entity0 's fluidity and intensity slacked off in the second half as they eased off the gas			0
@entity91 , also 17 , came on for his competitive debut for @entity0 on tuesday night that said , he still looked extremely confident for one so young and did not look over-awed by the occasion			1
he completed a remarkable 93.1 per cent of his 29 attempted passes - including playing a couple of nice through - balls to release @entity98 as the game became stretched late on			0
@entity100 for a winger , but @entity9 also provided an important clearance from a dangerous @entity6 attack			0
he is renowned for his pace and crossing ability , but unfortunately had little - to - no opportunity to show it on tuesday night			0
the winger ( right ) and @entity108 ( left ) both challenge @entity109 of @entity6 for the ball @entity10 ( 17 , defender , @entity68 ) - played 13 minutes minutes played : 13 @entity23 passes : 7 ( 6 completed ) pass completion rate : 85.7 per cent accurate forward - half passes : 2 forward - half pass completion : 100 per cent clearances : 3 fouls : 0 the commanding centre back barely had an opportunity to prove how invaluable he could be to an @entity0 first team severely lacking in power and leadership			1
however , for the 13 minutes he was on the field after replacing @entity124 , @entity10 did not put a single foot wrong			0
in fact , the 17 - year - old made three clearances - including a vital one just before @entity48 was about to unleash a shot from the edge of the area - and contributed a few nice passes too			1
he is already a regular in @entity0 's under 21 team and has excelled in the @entity134			0
@entity10 has also been capped for @entity135 at @entity58 level and is seen by @entity0 as a real defensive prospect for the future			2
