by @entity0 published : 02:19 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 13 september 2013 @entity2 ’s fiercest @entity1 critic has suggested he should be ousted because his personal ratings are as bad as @entity5 ’s least successful leader @entity4			1
@entity6 warned the @entity1 could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election even if picks up slightly in the polls , adding : ‘ it ’s nothing personal , you ’ve got to look at the facts			1
’ and in a fresh blow for mr @entity2 , his party has slumped to just eight per cent in the polls with voters saying the animal he most resembles is a poodle			2
dog days : under fire : @entity1 leader @entity2 is accused of holding back his party with his own unpopularity , with 15 per cent of people saying he resembled a poodle the @entity27 survey for @entity28 put @entity5 on 38 per cent and the @entity29 34 per cent			1
@entity31 @entity30 is on 13 per cent			2
the survey found 21 per cent think the @entity1 are untrustworthy , and 44 per cent say the party has not contributed ' anything positive '			1
asked which animal he most resembles , 15 per cent said a poodle , 13 per cent a labrador , , sheep 13 per cent and 11 per cent a snake			2
lord @entity40 , a close ally of business secretary @entity41 , said next year ’s local and @entity43 elections would be ‘ crunch time ’ as the biggest test of public opinion since 2010			2
he said next may would be a ‘ last chance ’ for the @entity1 to change direction			1
@entity6 ’s intervention will exasperate mr @entity2 ’s allies , coming just days before the party gathers for its annual conference in @entity53			1
the deputy prime minister said yesterday that an economic ‘ dawn appears to be breaking ’ - something that he claimed would not have happened had it not been for the @entity1			1
he told @entity58 he was ‘ very proud ’ of sticking with the coalition and helping to ‘ pilot the economy through its darkest hour ’			0
‘ you should n’t be complacent but it is moving in the right direction and i do n’t think that would ’ve happened if we had n’t been there , ’ mr @entity2 said			0
cheers : @entity6 used the interview on the eve of the @entity1 conference to again call for mr @entity2 to resign there are growing tensions in the @entity1 between those who want to start distancing themselves from the @entity29 in the run up to the 2015 general election , and those who think they must stick the course and seek to claim equal credit for the government ’s achievements			1
senior @entity1 minister @entity84 this week insisted the coalition would continue ‘ up to the wire ’ before the election			1
but @entity6 , in a provocative interview with political magazine @entity89 , said that would lead to disaster and insisted the @entity1 should split from their @entity29 coalition partners as soon as may next year in an attempt to convince voters they have a clear policy agenda of their own			1
he said mr @entity2 ’s personal poll ratings were ‘ very poor ’ and the party would have to think about whether it would do better under another leader			1
‘ we need to face facts , there ’s quite a lot of complacency going on and self - delusion going on			0
we are likely to lose seats , ’ he said			0
‘ if we are on 15 per cent we would hold 30 seats , if we are on 17 per cent we would hold 40 seats - and if we are on 13 per cent we would hold 20 seats ...			0
it ’s very important to maximise our national share of the vote to give our mps the best chance			2
’ @entity6 , who revealed in the interview that he and his wife are worth £ 10 million , said the party ’s poll ratings were currently stuck between 8 per cent and 10 per cent with ‘ no sign of improvement ’			1
‘ let ’s be objective ; we have to accept that @entity2 ’s ratings are very poor and have been for a long time			0
you ’ve got to be frank that his ratings are down at levels which if you go back were only seen by @entity125 shortly before she left , and @entity4			0
it ’s nothing personal , you ’ve got to look at the facts , ’ he said			2
state of the parties @entity31 ’s most expensive homes should be hit with a ‘ super mansion tax ’ to help raise billions in tax revenues , according to a senior @entity1			1
the party already advocates a 1 per cent tax on homes worth more than £ 2million , but party president @entity134 said those worth more should face an even higher rate			2
he said yesterday : ‘ you could have various rates within the mansion tax			0
a £ 4million property , for example , paying a higher rate			0
’ a tax on expensive properties is also backed by the @entity5			1
mr @entity134 told the @entity147 he wanted to charge people who had properties and wealth at much more than £ 2million ' a higher proportion ' instead of lowering the threshold to catch more properties			0
he said : ' you could have various rates within the mansion tax - a property worth £ 4million , for example , paying at a higher rate , as well as a higher global sum , than those with smaller properties			0
’ there is a way of doing this without damaging people who are potentially in a more marginal position			0
' ‘ you do have to say “ where are our prospects at the next election if we do n’t have a major and clear change and detachment from the @entity173 ? ” and we ’ve got to think about the best way to get that message over			0
’ the peer pointed to polls last year which suggested the party could add about three or four points to its ratings under another leader , adding : ‘ these are things people have to think about given how sensitive the number of our seats will be			1
it ’s for the party to decide			2
‘ it ’s disastrous if we are seen as a tin can tied to the @entity29 ’ tail in 2015			1
we have to move on to developing our own very clear and distinctive @entity1 message for next time			1
‘ it will be very difficult to do that if we are still in @entity195 at the next election			0
i believe we should disengage well before the next election , sixth months to a year before			0
’ a senior @entity1 source said : ‘ nobody who has ever spoken to @entity199 will be surprised to learn that he does n’t like @entity2 and that he enjoys talking about how rich he is			1
‘ this is a predictable annual occurrence			2
he last called for @entity2 to resign at conference in 2012			1
you can set your calendar by it			0
having a dig at @entity2 gives @entity199 his occasional moment in the sun. ’ mr @entity41 said : ‘ @entity199 is an independent minded member of the @entity209 , with his own views			2
' he does not speak for me			0
his comments today were seriously unhelpful			0
’ @entity1 pensions minister @entity212 acknowledged that the party had ‘ a lot of hard work to do ’ and ‘ you ’d rather the polls were better than they are ’			1
but he added : ‘ i ’ve seen us recover from worse than this and incumbency is important			0
we ’ve got a lot of work to do and we know we ’ve got to get our message across and in coalition it ’s a unique challenge to be distinctive			0
