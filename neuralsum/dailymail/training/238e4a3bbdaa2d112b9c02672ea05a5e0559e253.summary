by @entity0 published : 20:30 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 02:48 est , 22 february 2013 public concern over the welfare - to - work programme erupted last year when it emerged @entity4 boss @entity3 had paid herself £ 8.6m in a year @entity7 ’s flagship back - to - work programme was branded a ‘ shocking ’ failure last night – as it emerged that none of the 18 private providers has met its contract targets			1
in a damning assessment , the powerful commons public accounts committee said the £ 5billion @entity14 had made an ‘ extremely poor ’ start since its launch in the summer of 2011			1
the scheme , personally championed by the prime minister , pays private sector firms such as @entity4 and @entity20 to find jobs for the long - term unemployed			1
but during its first 14 months only 3.6 per cent of claimants on the scheme moved off benefits into lasting jobs			0
spending on the programme during the period totalled £ 435million , with each long - term job costing more than £ 14,000			1
the figures for the first 12 months were even worse			0
of 785,360 people referred to the @entity14 , just 18,270 ( or 2.3 per cent ) were found a lasting job			0
officials had estimated that 5 per cent would find jobs on their own in the first year if the scheme did not exist			1
@entity36 , @entity37 chairman of the committee , said : ‘ @entity39 is absolutely crucial for helping people , especially the most vulnerable , get into and stay in work			2
however its performance so far has been extremely poor			1
‘ the programme is particularly failing young people and the hardest to help			2
' it is shocking that of the 9,500 former incapacity benefit claimants referred to providers , only 20 people have been placed in a job that has lasted three months , while the poorest performing provider did not manage to place a single person in the under - 25 category into a job lasting six months			0
' the department must hold failing providers to account			0
’ the committee said it shared concerns that providers are concentrating on creaming off job placement bonuses from the easiest cases , and sidelining clients who require more time and investment , a process known as ‘ creaming and parking ’			1

his flagship back - to - work programme was branded a ' shocking ' failure last night - as it emerged that none of the 18 private providers has met its contract targets under the @entity14 , providers can earn between £ 3,700 and £ 13,700 per client , depending how hard it is to help an individual , with an initial payment of between £ 400 and £ 600			1
the main payments are made only after someone has been in work for six months – the government ’s definition of sustained employment			0
individuals are placed on the programme for two years , meaning that a full assessment of the scheme will not be possible until this summer			2
ministers have written to seven of the 18 private providers warning them they could lose their contracts unless they improve performance			0
none of the providers has met its targets			0
public concern over the welfare - to - work programme erupted last year when it emerged @entity4 boss @entity3 had paid herself £ 8.6million in a year , despite claims that the firm ’s record in finding jobs for the unemployed was ‘ abysmal ’			1
the @entity101 last night said the report painted a ‘ skewed picture ’			2
a spokesman said : ‘ it is making a real difference to tens of thousands of the hardest - to - help jobseekers			2
we know the performance of our providers is improving			0
