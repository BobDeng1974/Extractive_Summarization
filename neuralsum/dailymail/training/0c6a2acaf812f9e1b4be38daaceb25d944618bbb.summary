by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent robust response : her majesty 's chief inspector of schools , sir @entity5 , is to look into the practicalities of allowing any school to be inspected without notice six schools accused of spreading @entity14 extremism will be placed into special measures in a bid to tackle fanatics , a report into the ' @entity11 ' controversy is expected to reveal today			1
@entity18 is also planning ‘ no notice ’ inspections dubbed ' dawn raids ' as part of a crackdown on teachers who undermine ‘ @entity25 values ’			1
@entity27 has personally intervened in the controversy to demand an end to @entity18 ’s practice of giving schools two days ’ notice of an inspection			1
his move is a direct response to claims that hardline @entity38 schools are taking advantage of the advance warnings to change lessons and give the impression they are promoting a multicultural society and not denigrating @entity45			0
tough new powers to be outlined separately today by education secretary @entity47 could also see teachers and governors who undermine ‘ fundamental @entity25 values ’ barred from every school in the country			0
he will address mps after the publication by @entity18 of reports into 21 @entity58 schools that have allegedly been infiltrated by @entity14 extremists			1
the @entity60 has learned that six of these will be placed in special measures after ' significant evidence ' that children were not being adequately protected from extremism			0
five of those schools - including @entity69 and @entity70 - were previously judged as good or outstanding by @entity18 , but have now been rated inadequate following an investigation sparked by the so - called @entity11 allegations			1
ministers say this is precisely why advance notice inspections must be stopped			2

intervention : @entity27 will meet senior ministers , including home secretary @entity81 ( left ) and education secretary @entity47 ( right ) to ensure progress is being made on tackling extremism in schools findings from the @entity94 suggest that notice periods were used in schools in @entity58 to put on hastily arranged shows of cultural inclusion			1
the prime minister said : ‘ protecting our children is one of the first duties of @entity104 and that is why the issue of alleged @entity38 extremism in @entity58 schools demands a robust response			1
‘ the education secretary will now ask sir @entity5 to look into allowing any school to be inspected at no notice , stopping schools having the opportunity to cover up activities which have no place in our society			1
’ mr @entity47 said : ‘ evidence uncovered in @entity58 clearly indicates that schools have used the notice they have been given of inspections to evade proper scrutiny			1
' our children need to be kept safe from the dangers of extremism and guaranteed a broad and balanced curriculum			0
’ allegations : @entity70 , which has allegedly been infiltrated by extremists , has been iven glowing reports and rated ' outstanding ' by @entity18 in recent years a leaked report speaks of alarm at language and teaching in @entity133 , @entity58 the @entity11 allegations came to light earlier this year after a letter emerged claiming existence of a plan for hard - line @entity139 to seize control of schools by installing friendly governors , then forcing out uncooperative headteachers			1
the letter is now regarded as a hoax , but prompted investigations by @entity18 and the @entity148 , under orders from @entity47 as well as @entity150			2
the controversy has left @entity27 's government in crisis after mr @entity47 was forced to make a grovelling apology to the prime minister for undermining home secretary @entity81 , whose spin doctor had to quit for attacking the @entity47			2
the punishments were meted out after a furious mr @entity27 was compelled to intervene to stop a vicious power struggle between home secretary mrs may and education secretary mr @entity47			0
mr @entity47 agreed to say sorry after private remarks he made criticising her and @entity165 counter-terrorism boss @entity164 at a lunch with @entity168 newspaper executives over the @entity165 ’s handling of extremism in schools appeared in the media			2
mrs may ’s spin doctor , @entity173 , was forced to quit for leaking a damaging private letter to mr @entity47 written by mrs may			0
many in the @entity176 have expressed anger over the investigations , with staff at one of the schools inspected branding the inquiries nothing short of ' a witch - hunt '			0
mr @entity27 also said he was calling a special meeting of the government ’s @entity185 to discuss the implications arising from the findings of the @entity18 review and the wider situation in @entity58			2
mr @entity47 is expected to say today that the five or more schools to be placed in special measures by @entity18 could have their governors and leadership teams removed			2
powers granted in february will allow him to impose an indefinite ban on anyone whose conduct has undermined ‘ fundamental @entity25 values ’ , including ‘ individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance or those with different faiths and beliefs ’			0
the @entity206 , a governor at @entity208 primary school , one of the 21 inspected , told @entity209 that allegations were made that were ' completely untrue ' after the departure of its head and deputy head teacher last year			0
' our school was named in a document which has become known as the @entity11 document , as being one where the head teacher and the deputy head teacher had been removed by an insurgency			0
those allegations we utterly rejected , ' he said			0
' i do think it is right that once criticisms or complaints are made about schools that we see them through and make sure we know that we have answers			0
' commenting on the wider inquiry , he said : ' there is a wide variety of allegations that have been made by a number of different groups and people and it is absolutely right that we get to the bottom of what is going on , so that people have confidence in saying that there is no extremism in @entity58 schools and that children are adequately protected from those risks			1
' but i think there is a genuine risk of making it seem as though @entity14 is the same as extremism , or @entity14 is the same as terrorism , those things are categorically not true			2
' it is very wise and very right that we should respect @entity14 communities in east @entity58 , it is very right that we should allow that to be reflected in the culture of our schools because those things are good and noble and we want things that are good and noble celebrated in our schools			1
' the @entity11 allegations came to light earlier this year after a letter emerged claiming existence of a plan for hard - line @entity139 to seize control of schools by installing friendly governors , then forcing out uncooperative headteachers			0
the letter is now regarded as a hoax , but prompted investigations by @entity18 and the @entity148 , under orders from @entity47 as well as @entity150			0
@entity70 , @entity283 and @entity284 are all expected to be given inadequate ratings and placed in special measures , with their governing boards replaced			0
