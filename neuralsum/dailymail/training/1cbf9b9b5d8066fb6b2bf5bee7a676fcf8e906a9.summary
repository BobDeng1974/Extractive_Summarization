after yesterday 's woeful performance in the 3 - 0 @entity4 defeat by @entity5 , @entity1 fans may be tempted to press the panic button before the season has even begun			1
but do n't worry too much , @entity1 fans , with your star names still to return and history on your side , this could yet transpire to be yet another glorious season for @entity16 's men ...			1
best players still to return @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 were all rested after their @entity36 exertions			1
other star names such as @entity38 and @entity39 only started on the bench			2
many of those players would walk into and transform @entity1 's starting line - up			2
do n't expect to see too much more of @entity44 and @entity45 in a @entity1 shirt this season			0
suited not booted : @entity28 , @entity30 , @entity33 , @entity48 and @entity29 of @entity1 watch the 3 - 0 loss to @entity5 in the @entity4 from a @entity23 executive box @entity52 chat : @entity30 talks to @entity5 manager @entity53 ahead of the match 2			1
city were slow starters last season the @entity58 lost four of their first 11 games last season and @entity16 's side were languishing in 8th position by the middle of november			1
they were even below @entity64 ' @entity63 by that stage			0
as with all the best title winners , they clicked into gear when it truly mattered , losing only two of their last 27 matches and winning their last five			0
there will be no panic at @entity1 , although clashes against @entity77 , @entity5 and @entity78 before the end of september will call for a vast improvement			0
slow starters : @entity16 's side took a little time to get going last season but ended up as champions video my team were n't ready - @entity16 just champion : @entity30 lifts the @entity87 trophy on the final day last season 3			1
@entity18 is set to arrive the @entity88 will add further pace and athleticism to the @entity1 rearguard and is expected to form an outstanding partnership with @entity30			2
it was a problem position for @entity16 for much of last season - although @entity31 did come good in the end - and the @entity94 will be relieved to now have two centre - backs of elite standing in his ranks			0
incoming : city are set to complete the signing of @entity101 's @entity18 to strengthen their defence 4			2
the @entity4 is not the best indicator come on , now , even @entity64 ' @entity63 won it last year			0
more pertinently , the last time @entity1 lost in the @entity4 - in the summer of 2011 - they went on to win the @entity87 title			1
when they won the @entity4 against @entity78 the following summer , they then surrendered their crown and lost to @entity107 in the @entity109 final			0
false dawn : @entity64 lifted the @entity4 this time last year but his tenure at @entity63 was a disaster 5			0
history suggests the @entity115 is on the last team to lose a @entity4 3 - 0 ? the @entity63 team that would go on to win the treble in 1999			1
on that summer 's day in 1998 , @entity63 were defeated by a @entity119 - inspired @entity5			0
so do n't worry too much @entity1 fans			0
oh , and some bad news for giddy @entity5 followers ... the @entity121 failed to win the @entity87 on the four previous occasions they lifted the charity or @entity4 ( 1998 - 1999 , 1999 - 2000 , 2002 - 2003 , 2004 - 05 )			2
no form guide : @entity5 won the 1998 @entity4 3 - 0 against @entity63 , but @entity129 's side went on to win a @entity115 of the @entity130 , @entity87 and @entity109 that season			1

@entity1 were well beaten 3 - 0 by @entity5 in the @entity4
but @entity16 's side were missing a number of star names
@entity30 , @entity34 , @entity29 , @entity28 , @entity32 and @entity33 are all still to return
city were slow starters last season but went on to win @entity87 title
@entity18 will arrive *imminently* from @entity101
@entity4 is *rarely* a *barometer* of how season will go
