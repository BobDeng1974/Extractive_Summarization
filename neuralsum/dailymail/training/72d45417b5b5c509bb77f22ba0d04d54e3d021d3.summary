@entity1 governor @entity0 said sunday that his state 's border with @entity4 is so porous that ' more than 20,000 ' illegal immigrants have crossed it since january 1			1
the startling claim comes as congressional @entity8 are pushing hard against president @entity11 's ' executive amnesty ' plan that would mainstream more than 5 million people who are in the @entity13 illegally			1
' we all saw what happened on the @entity1 border last summer , but we need to understand that the problem is not going away , ' @entity0 said on the @entity19 show ' @entity20			1
' ' already this calendar year , since january 1 , we have had more than 20,000 people come across the border , apprehended , unauthorized			0
and so we have an ongoing problem on the border that @entity26 must step up and solve			2
' astonishing : @entity1 gov. @entity0 said more than 20,000 illegal immigrants have poured across his state 's border with @entity4 since january 1 , and blames the @entity11 administration awkward : @entity0 was in the room along with 49 other state governors when president @entity11 addressed them on monday @entity11 's plan that he announced in november does n't apply to illegal immigrants who entered the @entity13 in the last five years			1
the president outlined his intentions four months ago and framed them as an effort to reprioritize scarce @entity40 resources in a way that focused more on new border - crossers and less on people the @entity44 sees as otherwise law - abiding residents			1
' if you plan to enter the @entity13 illegally , your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up , ' @entity11 said nov. 20			2
but that message has n't percolated into the communities of @entity4 and @entity50 who are desperate for what they believe is a free ticket to live in @entity13 without fear of deportation			0
that 's the deal @entity11 has offered to a larger but different group of people , including countless hundreds of thousands of adults who have had children after sneaking into the @entity13			2
he is also promising them work permits and @entity66 numbers , something the @entity8 fears will be impossible to roll back once it 's in place			1
a federal judge agreed last week , calling a halt to the entire process			1
at the same time , the @entity11 administration says it stopped 213,719 people from taking up residence in the @entity13 illegally last year			0
most , however , get through a loose net of border security that then - governor @entity79 augmented with his own armed @entity81 officers last year			0
@entity1 : federal border patrol agents have snagged hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants as they cross the border , but nearly a million live in @entity1 already @entity85 : @entity0 's predecessor @entity79 put hundreds of @entity87 troops on the front lines to stem the human tide , and hundreds more are coming @entity0 said he will up the ante with ' more than 500 more @entity81 officers , more @entity91 , more technology			1
we are coming out of our own pocket , @entity1 taxpayers ' pockets , to secure the border and doing the job that the federal government must do			2
' more than 800,000 ilegal immigrants currently live in @entity1 , though			0
' you do n't have enough buses to send them back to @entity4 , and i do n't expect you can put all of them in jail , ' @entity19 host @entity101 asked @entity0 on sunday			2
' what are you going to do with them ? ' ' well , two things , ' the governor said			0
' one is , the president himself said as these people were coming across the border that he would repatriate them as soon as possible			0
so , we need to see whether or not the president himself is going to live up to the commitment that he made			0
' the second part , he said , is up to federal lawmakers : ' we need @entity26 to have the latitude to fulfill its responsibility to solve the problem			0
' @entity44 @entity8 say they 've done thir part , passing a homeland security budget that strengthens border controls and zeroes out what they call @entity11 's ' executive amnesty			1
' house speaker @entity129 castigated @entity131 @entity130 this month for blocking the measure on the other side of the @entity134 , saying they need to ' get up off their a * * and do something			0

@entity1 is ground zero for the illegal immigration fight
gov. @entity0 says he will increase the number of his own state - based troops who will patrol the border *â€“* something the @entity44 wo n't do
president @entity11 announced a plan in 2014 to mainstream 5 million illegal immigrants by giving them work permits and @entity66 numbers
a federal judge put a freeze on that plan last week
the *unexpected* *development* came as @entity8 in @entity26 are trying to use the power of the purse to *defund* @entity11 's plan
