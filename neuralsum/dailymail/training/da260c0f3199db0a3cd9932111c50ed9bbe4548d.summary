by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:40 pm on 2nd august 2011 the eurozone faced fresh financial fears today as @entity4 and @entity5 edged closer to the spiralling abyss of debt engulfing the region			1
the two countries have both been crippled by painfully slow economic growth but so far managed to avoid the kind of handouts given to @entity13 and @entity14			0
but the stock indexes in the two countries plummeted today while the yields on their bonds soared to record highs , sparking a risk of them defaulting			1
concerns : @entity4 's prime minister @entity22 has cancelled his holiday to monitor the economic problems the yield for the @entity4 10 - year bond rose as far as 6.45 percent , the highest since the euro was created			1
the rate is near the levels seen in @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity30 before they were forced to ask for rescue loans , and prompted @entity4 prime minister @entity22 to delay his vacation to monitor the situation			2
@entity5 's equivalent bond yield jumped to 6.18 per cent , above where it was before july 21 , when the @entity37 announced its latest debt crisis plan , including a second @entity14 bailout , to calm and contain market jitters			1
@entity4 's main stock index was down 1.3 percent in late afternoon trading after plunging 3.2 per cent a day earlier , while @entity5 's fell another 1.4 per cent			1
on the defensive : @entity5 economy minister @entity44 the heightened market pressure bodes ill for @entity5 and @entity4 , the eurozone 's third - and fourth - largest economies , which are both too expensive to rescue for @entity49 's bailout fund			1
the turmoil is due to a toxic mix of market concerns about growth , not only in @entity49 but also the @entity54 , and the possibility that the debt crisis will continue spreading			2
over the past two weeks , markets have been roiled by worries that the @entity54 economy may be sliding back toward recession and have its credit rating cut			2
in times of trouble , investors ' knee - jerk reaction is to sell what they perceive as high - risk assets and buy into safer ones			0
that was evident by the fall in the yield for @entity73 bonds , which investors bought up as they sold so - called peripheral ones , those of countries with poor government finances			0
' there is increasing uncertainty in the market and all the peripheral markets , the ones which have weaker political contexts , will continue to suffer , ' said @entity84 , managing director of @entity85 , a @entity86 - based asset managment company			0
the rising borrowing rates sent shockwaves rippling through the two nations ' political leadership			0
@entity5 finance minister @entity44 called an emergency meeting in @entity86 to analyze the situation and arranged to meet @entity93 , the chairman of the @entity95 meetings of eurozone nations , on wednesday			2
tumble : the @entity97 starts the day at around 990 points but by 5pm it has fallen to below 930 @entity22 , meanwhile , delayed his vacation so he could ' follow more closely the evolution of economic indicators , ' his administration said in a statement			0
the move came just four days after he called early general elections for november - largely due to pressure on his administration from the financial crisis and because he wants a new government to manage the troubled @entity4 economy for all of next year instead of part of it			1
@entity37 officials sought to downplay the danger of @entity4 and @entity5 edging closer toward needing a bailout , but the @entity117 said it was monitoring the situation closely			1
' we are very confident in both the @entity4 and @entity5 authorities ' determination to get their economies back on track , ' said @entity124 , a spokeswoman for the @entity37 's executive			1
deal : @entity54 president @entity127 reached an agreement on the country 's debt but still faces economic problems she said that in the @entity117 's view , ' there is no factual evidence ( about the two countries ' economies ) that has changed in the last few days			0
' ' the question of a rescue plan ( for @entity4 ) is not on the table , it has n't been discussed , ' @entity124 said			2
@entity143 leaders agreed on july 21 to a second , 109 billion euros bailout for @entity14 and overhauled their rescue fund in hopes of keeping market turmoil from spreading to @entity4 and @entity5			1
but the deal gave only a temporary lift to @entity4 and @entity5 bonds			1
just days later , global markets were rocked by the possibility that the @entity54 may default on its debt by not raising its borrowing ceiling			2
it managed to clinch a deal just in time , but investor sentiment was shaken profoundly			0
at the same time , @entity54 indicators showed its economy was slowing sharply			0
the combination caused traders to move their cash into the safest investments - such as @entity73 bonds , @entity168 accounts , and gold			0
@entity171 collapse : @entity14 was forced to accept a second @entity37 bailout last month after facing mounting debt in that context , confidence in the @entity37 crisis plan 's ability to protect @entity4 and @entity5 from the market turmoil dropped rapidly			1
that is partly because the deal included asking bondholders to take losses on the value of their holdings by swapping them for longer - dated bonds with lower interest			0
losses for private investors - a first in the 21 - month debt crisis - has underlined the risks to banks , insurance companies and others who hold eurozone debt			0
elevated yields show the additional interest investors demand to hold the country 's debt , and underline how their financing costs could rise when they need to tap bond markets again			1
as fears of default increase , interest rates rise and make paying debt even harder in a vicious circle			0
@entity4 is struggling to recover from nearly two years of recession triggered in large part by the collapse of an overheated real estate sector			2
burdened by a swollen deficit , the country 's jobless rate stands at a eurozone high of nearly 21 per cent			0
@entity5 has debt of 120 per cent of economic output , but had been viewed for months with calm by bond markets			1
the country has low levels of private debt and has not had the real estate boom and bust that caused trouble for the @entity54 , @entity4 , and @entity13			2
but it suffers from chronically low growth and investors doubt the government 's willingness and ability to push through painful economic reforms .			0

government borrowing costs in @entity5 and @entity4 soar to record highs
