@entity0 hopes @entity3 's higher @entity2 seeding will prevent another ' group of death ' when the draw takes place in @entity8 on thursday			1
@entity3 's current @entity10 co-efficient will see @entity12 's side in the pot of eight second seeds in the draw , which should hand his club an easier group than in the last two seasons			2
@entity20 and @entity21 , should the @entity19 qualify , will be in the pot of eight top seeds , and @entity24 among the third seeds			0
@entity39 defender @entity0 said : ' we know we are @entity3 and have a strong squad to play against the best teams in @entity10 so we will see the draw and this time if we have a little bit more luck than the last few years			1
' we were in the group of death and it has always been tough for us in @entity2 - but it is a competition we are looking forward to and hopefully we can do better			2
' the rest of the teams see @entity3 as a tough team to have in the group and i think that is the most important thing for us			0
' groups : last year @entity3 faced then - champions @entity31 in the group stages the prospect of being drawn in as tough group as that is a worry for @entity24 - with the worse - case scenario seeing the @entity62 drawn with reigning champions @entity36 , big - spending @entity63 and @entity65 side @entity64			1
@entity20 and @entity21 , however , will be guaranteed to avoid the big @entity67 powers such as @entity36 , @entity68 , @entity31 or last season beaten finalists @entity70			2
the draw at the @entity73 in @entity8 will see 32 teams drawn into eight groups of four			0
the @entity77 clubs can not be drawn into the same group as each other			0
as in previous seasons , the top two in each group will qualify for the knock - out stages of the @entity2 and the third - placed side go into the knock - out stages of the @entity86			0
last 16 : because they were in a difficult group , @entity3 finished second , meaning they faced @entity68 afetrwards it ’s not too late to play @entity90 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			1

@entity3 will be seeded higher in this year 's @entity2
@entity0 hopes @entity3 can avoid a difficult group
@entity3 have faced @entity31 , @entity68 and @entity37 in recent years
