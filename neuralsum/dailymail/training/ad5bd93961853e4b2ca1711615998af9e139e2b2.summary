for nearly half a century , it has been the nerve - centre of some of the country ’s most high profile police investigations – including the @entity5 ’s mainland bombing campaign in the 1970s , the disappearance of @entity7 and the july 2005 terror attacks			1
with its famous revolving sign outside , @entity9 has also become one of @entity13 ’s most iconic buildings , a popular destination on the tourist trail and served as a backdrop to thousands of tv crime reports			1
but not for much longer , after it was announced today today that the office block has been sold to an investment company in @entity21 for £ 370million as part of a radical cost - cutting plan which will see the new hq located in a much smaller building a few miles away			1
the current @entity24 – known to many in the police simply as ‘ @entity27 ’ - has been home to the @entity29 since 1967 and today it is surrounded by concrete barriers to protect it from terrorist attack			1
but as these pictures from 47 years ago show , things were very different when the building was opened			0
an officer holding a metal food tray lines up for his lunch at @entity9 's self service canteen in 1967 pictured is the dining area of the canteen , where police officers and other staff members can be seen drinking tea and coffee the selective vertical document conveyor ( left ) carried files between floors , while right , dozens of people work the phone lines in @entity9 's information room officers work in @entity9 's state - of - the - art automatic teleprinter exchange room in 1967			1
at the time , teleprinters were used to send typed communications there were no need for bomb - proof barricades outside to protect police from enemy attack , no need for armed officers to patrol the perimeter of the building , let alone the deployment of dozens of cctv cameras			0
members of the public could simply walk into @entity9 off the street , with no need to go through airport style security to reach the reception area			0
in the z - cars , @entity75 era , things were radically different inside , too			0
with their starched blue shirts and short back and sides haircuts , the officers of 1967 seem a world away from the image of the modern day copper			0
it was a time when @entity87 @entity86 was on the run from @entity89 ; the @entity90 were running amok in the @entity91 ; and the @entity29 was still mourning the murder of three officers gunned down by career criminal @entity94 in @entity97 's @entity96 the previous year			2
seatbelts had just been introduced to cars ; in july , the police breathalyser arrived			0
in september , a ' new style ' uniform was unveiled for female officers			0
staff pictured as they painstakingly file hard - copy criminal records during the arduous move to their new headquarters in 1967 pictured is the briefing room - a university - style lecture hall where officers would detail their tactical plans prior to raids as they stored paper files , examined a giant map of @entity13 in the map room , and answered calls via a rudimentary switchboard , surely none of these officers could ever have imagined how 47 years later , officers would be bogged down by multi-million pound computer databases and call centres , target - obsessed politicians and politically correct diversity units			1
indeed the first police computer had been installed only four years earlier : its purpose was to manage the payroll and statistics , rather than track criminals			0
the @entity29 plans to move its head office to a smaller former police station which has been empty for the last three years			1
the @entity138 site on @entity139 along the @entity140 will become the force 's head office in 2016 and will be known simply as @entity9			1
the relocation is designed to help the force save six million pounds a year in running costs and avoid the £ 50million expense needed to refurbish the current head office , it said			0

right , two officers are pictured filing criminal records a group of men move a filing cabinet full of criminal records into the new building during the force 's move in 1967 @entity138 will have desk space for 1,000 officers , less than half the number in the current building , using mobile technology to enable officers to work more flexibly			1
the revolving triangle will be moved to the new site			1
originally bought from @entity168 in 2008 for £ 123million , the current @entity9 building was marketed as ‘ @entity169 ’ and had a guide price of £ 250million - well above initial estimates of £ 150million , thanks to soaring @entity13 property prices			2
the hq of the @entity29 has moved before – from @entity175 to @entity176 in 1875 , to the @entity178 building in 1890 and to the current building in 1967			2
this future move therefore marks a return to nearer its founding location , the force says			0
@entity13 mayor @entity184 said the @entity29 needs a home fit for the future , but police budgets are under real pressure			2
this section of the telecommunications department handled the switchboards for staff phone lines a woman places identifying marks on a huge wall size map of @entity13 , in a section of @entity9 known as the map room officers working in the information room , where they take tip offs and emergency calls from the public the @entity29 has sold its home since 1967 , pictured left , for £ 370 million to @entity21 investors			1
the iconic revolving sign , right , which has now become a tourist attraction , will move to the new building in 2016 he said today : ‘ the sale of this under - used and outdated building means we can now not only protect that rich heritage , but also fund the new hq and kit out bobbies with the latest mobile technology to secure the future of the force			1
‘ this landmark deal allows us to preserve the past whilst giving today 's @entity29 a vital cash boost so our officers can go on keeping @entity13 safe			2
’ but it is not only traditionalists who are mourning the imminent closure of news @entity9			0
pub landlords in the vicinity of the current hq – where pubs popular with thirsty officers include @entity230 , the @entity231 and the @entity232 - are expecting a significant drop in takings when the @entity29 moves home .			2

photos from @entity29 move in 1967 provide *fascinating* insight how force operated prior to the *digital* *revolution*
images show *crates* of *paperwork* detailing criminal records and what was once state - of - the - art policing technology
it was announced today @entity9 office block near @entity252 has been sold to @entity21 company
the met police headquarters , along with its famous revolving triangle sign , will shift to @entity139
