@entity0 wants to lure 2,300 of its doctors to leave the @entity3 and return home			1
@entity5 , the @entity0 ambassador to the @entity7 , revealed plans were being drawn up to persuade hundreds of health staff trained in @entity0 to return , declaring : ‘ we want them back			1
’ he also cast doubt on proposals by @entity7 to limit access to benefits for @entity16 migrants , insisting it will make little difference to the numbers of people who move to the @entity7 in search of work and a better life			1
@entity24 , the @entity0 ambassador to the @entity7 , said his country wants to attract more @entity0 doctors back home and dismissed the idea that benefit curbs would reduce the number of @entity16 migrants to @entity7 around a third of the 133,000 doctors in the @entity3 in @entity33 were trained outside the @entity7			1
mr @entity24 suggested hundreds were from @entity0 , and he wanted them to leave the @entity7 and return home			1
‘ of course we want them back , of course , ’ he told @entity37 ’s today programme			0
‘ we have lost - from what i know - 2,300 doctors in @entity7			2
of course they were educated in @entity0 for free so we want them , it is obvious			2
‘ we are doing our best to create conditions so that they could come back and work in @entity0			1
’ many in the health service argue it could not cope without the influx of qualified professionals from overseas			0
almost a third of doctors working in the @entity3 were trained outside the @entity7 , according to latest figures last month health secretary @entity52 announced dozens of extra foreign doctors had been drafted to bolster hospitals facing a winter crisis			2
however , @entity57 mp @entity56 suggested @entity7 did not need as many foreign workers and curbs should be introduced			0
‘ @entity60 has a very low birth rate , they need foreign workers			0
‘ it has been causing real problems in hospitals , schools , has contributed to shortage of housing , we need to be able to address this in our national interest – we respect theirs , they should respect ours			0
’ @entity75 last week announced it would ban migrants from claiming out of work benefits for two years and look to curb access to in - work benefits , like tax credits			2
@entity81 is expected to make a speech on immigration within days in which he will also pledge to impose limits on migrants ’ access to the welfare state			1
@entity81 is expected to announce a major crackdown on benefits for migrants within days , after @entity75 's @entity92 announced plans to ban claims for jobseekers allowance for two years and curb access to tax credits for those in work latest figures show that almost 65,000 people from the @entity16 were claiming jobseekers allowance in february this year latest figures show there are 64,830 @entity16 migrants claiming jobseekers allowance in the @entity7 , while are 252,000 working households from the @entity16 receive tax credits			1
mr @entity24 insisted that attempts to limit access to these benefits would not stop @entity0 moving to @entity7			1
‘ i would n’t say it would have an enormous effect … benefit tourism is only a small fraction of abuse of the system			0
‘ people do n’t come here for benefits they come here for work			2
’ he said that there are a lot of ‘ wrong assumptions ’ about the motivations people have for moving to the @entity7 ‘ one is people sit at home in @entity0 and start calculating how much they can lose and gain			1
’ ‘ we have several important reasons if we decide to emigrate to other countries to work			0
‘ i know very wealthy people who moved to @entity130 and other countries for better research laboratories			0
‘ the wrong assumption is the same as it was 20 years ago that we have low skilled labour , a lot of them are low skilled but a lot of them are not			0
‘ they are attracted because the wages are higher , not the benefits			0
