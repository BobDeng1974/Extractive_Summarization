@entity0 loves running around , playing outside and blowing kisses			1
but unlike any other children , she suffers from an extremely rare condition which means she has no nose			1
the 17 - month - old has complete congenital arhinia , which is so rare there are only around 40 cases reported in medical literature			1
and despite her difficulties , she always has a smile on her face , her mother @entity20 says			0
' at first i just could n't understand it , i did n't even know it was possible			0
' how did my little girl not have a nose ? was she going to live ? would anyone be able to help her ? ' but ever since we got her home she 's grown every day , smiled more and the more she shines the more her differences fade into the background			2
@entity0 with her parents @entity34 and @entity36			1
they decided to share her daughter 's story to raise awareness of the condition , which is thought to affect around 40 people ' @entity0 is so petite but she 's the most determined little girl i know , she adores her big brother and sister , copies everything they do and despite her " disabilities " is already a typical toddler who climbs the furniture and loves to dance			1
@entity52 is the absence of the nose and parts of the olfactory ( the sense of smell ) system			1
one type is congenital arhinia ( where the person is born with it ) , another is acquired arhinia ( loss of the nose to cancer , infection , or accident )			1
it can be total ( complete absence of the external nose and all / or parts of the olfactory ( the sense of smell ) system , the website widesmiles reports			1
or , it can be partial ( only parts of the external nose and olfactory system is missing )			2
' everyone who meets her instantly falls in love with her , we just want her to inspire other people like she inspires us			2
' just weeks after giving birth , while researching the condition on the internet , she came across a journal online which stated that babies born like @entity0 had poor mental and physical development			1
she claims it implied that parents should be given the option to terminate their pregnancy			0
mrs @entity0 , a full time carer from @entity98 , @entity99 , says her daughter proves that statement wrong			1
recalling the birth , she said : ' as soon as i saw her face i knew something was wrong			0
' i was in shock and i just froze			0
the midwife cut the cord before i could even say anything and whisked her away from me			0
' @entity0 's condition was detected during the 20 - week scan which showed an abnormally flat facial profile			1
her mother and father - @entity34 , 32 , a nightclub manager - were told to prepare to make difficult decisions but the follow up @entity115 and tests revealed @entity0 was perfectly healthy and everything was normal			1
but the birth was extremely traumatic			0
' doctors were able to stabilize her so she could breathe on her own and eventually i was allowed to hold her for a few seconds , ' recalls mrs @entity0			1
' i kissed her forehead and told her i loved her before they took her away			0
' @entity123 was also born with other problems related to her condition , including a tiny hole in her heart and problems with her sight ' i felt so lonely and helpless , i was supposed to protect my baby and be able to help but i could n't			2
there were tubes coming out of her tiny little body everywhere			0
' she spent her first five weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit which were undoubtedly the worst weeks of my life			0
' there are just 47 recorded cases in the @entity139 records of people with partial or full facial anomalies and mrs @entity0 admits she was worried about what people would think of her daughter 's face			1
' i found it a real struggle and was too scared of what people would think of her to even go outside at first , ' she said			2
but she found the confidence after seeking support from the charity ' @entity153 ' and cranio - facial charity ' headlines '			0
' wearing @entity0 in a sling gave me the confidence to first go out in public , since it gave me control over who could see her			2
' ' now when we 're out and about i 'm no longer afraid of what people might think			0
in fact i think she will help people see that ' different ' can be beautiful too			0
' @entity0 will shortly begin treatment at @entity165			1
the procedure will design a nose - shaped mould which can be inserted through an incision along her hairline and placed where her nose should be she added : ' @entity0 is no longer a silent baby thanks to a special speaking valve			1
she runs around , plays outside and can blow the most gorgeous kisses			0
' @entity0 will shortly begin treatment at @entity165			1
the procedure will design a nose - shaped mould which can be inserted through an incision along her hairline and placed where her nose should be			1
her ' nose ' will be replaced with a bigger one every couple of year as she grows			2
' we 've explored different options but we settled on the least invasive one which will have the least drastic effect on her appearance , ' said mrs @entity0			2
her mother @entity36 says using a sling gave her the confidence to first go out in public , as it gave her control over who could see @entity0 ' she is totally perfect to us the way she is , but we have to think about what will make life as normal as possible for her in the long run			2
it 's not been an easy decision			0
' @entity0 was also born with other problems related to her condition , including a tiny hole in her heart and problems with her sight			1
at just 11 weeks old she needed surgery to remove a cataract on her left eye but complications left her completely blind in that eye			0
she also needed a tracheostomy fitted to allow her to breathe while eating and sleeping			0
despite having a difficult start to life , @entity0 has always been healthy and met all her milestones , her mother says			2
she has decided to share her daughter 's story after learning about an @entity217 family who were inspired to adopt a little girl with @entity52 - called @entity219 - in @entity220 who was in an orphanage			0
' i hope @entity0 's story inspires other people and families , i never want any child to be unloved or left alone because of their differences and diagnosis ' ' i ca n't believe how much can change in a year			1
i was so worried about my little girl when she was born but she 's defied all the odds and i am so proud and grateful to be her mummy			0
' her husband @entity34 added : ' we know there are still challenges and multiple surgeries to come but when she flashes that cheeky grin of hers , it 's all worth it			0
' @entity0 's parents have set up a fund to help ease the financial strain that caring for @entity0 's complex medical needs brings			2
