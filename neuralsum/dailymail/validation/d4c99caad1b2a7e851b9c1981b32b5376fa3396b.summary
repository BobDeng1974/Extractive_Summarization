to kill a mockingbird author @entity1 rarely talks directly to journalists , so when a @entity4 reporter received a note from her telling him to ' go away ' , it was considered a major coup the blunt reply she gave to @entity27 has seemingly put these worries to bed			1
the writer concluded that this reply could only have come from someone who 's of sound mind			1
sheets wrote : ' it appears that @entity36 , as her friends call her , is very much with it , that she is still lucid and that her acerbic , press - averse side is fully intact			1
' @entity1 had mesmerizing success with her book @entity40 , released over half a century ago , and fans and writers were both delighted and taken aback to hear that @entity1 was releasing another novel			2
they were even more surprised to learn that it was a manuscript written 60 years ago and hidden away after an editor told the young novelist to recast the book into what would become @entity40			0
go set a @entity50 , finished in the mid- 1950s , features many of the same characters as @entity40 and was discovered last year among her papers by lawyer @entity54			2
but she was quoted by gossip blog @entity56 as saying last july that her client sometimes signed things ' she did not understand '			0
since publisher @entity13 stunned the literary world with news that @entity1 ( pictured in 2007 ) is publishing a second novel , controversy has raged about whether the reclusive , 88 - year - old novelist is of sound mind go set a watchman is already number one in the best - seller list at online bookstore @entity68 , where the 304 - page hardback is available for pre-order ahead of its july release			1
pictured right is @entity4 investigative journalist @entity27 who was lucky enough to receive a hand - written note from @entity1 could @entity1 , who had a stroke in 2007 and so often said she would never publish again , really be happy that a manuscript , long since discarded , was going to see the light of day ? mr @entity27 has n't been able to answer that question , but has confirmed that she seems to be mentally focussed and harboring a familiar contempt for journalists			1
it is well known that @entity1 has poor eye sight and is deaf			2
she has lived since 2007 in a nursing home in @entity86 , @entity87 , where all requests for visits reportedly go through her lawyer			0
mr @entity27 described how he made repeated attempts to talk to her , eventually writing a two - page letter to her on february 5			2
this week that letter arrived on his doormat , with four words scribbled at the bottom in black pen - ' go away ! @entity1 '			1
sheets said : ' she may have softened her language as she has advanced well into her golden years , but the thrust is the same : leave her alone			0
' @entity104 took on the role of @entity1 's gatekeeper after the author 's fiercely protective sister @entity109 died last summer			1
tongues started wagging and @entity104 has been on the defensive , telling the @entity112 that @entity1 is ' extremely hurt and humiliated ' by allegations that she has been manipulated			2
' she is a very strong , independent and wise woman who should be enjoying the discovery of her long lost novel , ' @entity104 told the newspaper through emails and text messages			0
' instead , she is having to defend her own credibility and decision - making			0
' in february @entity104 released an earlier statement telling fans that @entity1 is ' happy as hell ' about the new book			2
@entity4 media has fallen on the story , quoting alleged friends and associates of @entity1 as attesting to her excitement and lucidity , or raising doubts and speculation			1
@entity1 , who rarely speaks to the media , said via @entity13 that she was ' humbled and amazed ' the manuscript was to be published after so many years			0
go set a watchman is already number one in the best - seller list at online bookstore @entity68 , where the 304 - page hardback is available for pre-order ahead of its july release			0
@entity143 reported that @entity1 's friend , @entity144 , visited her the day before news of the book came out and said she was of sound mind			1
' does she understand what 's going on ? if you make her hear , she can understand what 's going on , ' he said on @entity143			0
' can she give informed consent ? absolutely , she can give informed consent			0
' to kill a @entity40 won the @entity156 for its tale of racial injustice in the @entity159 - era @entity160			0
published in 1960 , is has become standard reading in @entity4 classrooms and has been translated into more than 40 languages , as well as adapted into an @entity165 - winning film starring @entity166			1
@entity167 said that regardless of its merits , go set a watchman will be of important literary and scholarly value			0
' what 's in a writer 's mind is always interesting , ' she told @entity175			0
' anything that makes people read is good and anything that makes people talk about race in this country is good			0
