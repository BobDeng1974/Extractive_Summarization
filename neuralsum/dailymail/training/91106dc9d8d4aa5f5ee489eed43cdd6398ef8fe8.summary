chimpanzees learn kindness by watching and experiencing the compassion of others , a new study suggests			1
scientists claim it ’s the first evidence that both children and chimps share common traits of altruism that are learned from the sociable behaviour of peers			1
the study seems to offer fresh evidence of the evolutionary roots of kindness in humans and non-human primates			2
scientists claim it ’s the first evidence that both children and chimps share common traits of altruism that are learned from the sociable behaviour of peers researchers from the @entity33 and @entity34 in @entity35 , demonstrated that contrary to earlier findings , in certain conditions , primates display similar behaviour to humans			1
professor @entity41 explained : ‘ a regard for the welfare of others is seen as a cardinal human virtue			0
by contrast , several recent scientific studies have concluded that the same dispositions are lacking in our closest living primate relatives			0
‘ the results of our research provide the first evidence that both children and chimpanzees share common traits of altruism that are learned as a direct result of experiencing the kindness of others			1
’ his team studied and compared the ‘ prosocial ’ actions of children aged between four and eight years old , as well as those of adults , chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys , according to the study , published in @entity67 ’s @entity66			1
they came to their conclusion after conducting experiments with pairs of chimpanzees ( left ) , monkeys , children ( right ) and adults , which involved them rewarding each other with food in boxes			2
researchers were interested in whether participants provided rewards to others , as well as the quality of the rewards the researchers studied the ‘ prosocial ’ actions of children aged between four and eight years old , as well as those of adults , chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys			2
they defined it as voluntary actions that benefit individuals or society , such as helping , sharing and co-operating with others			0
such actions are considered essential for maintaining effective communities , offering immediate benefit and encouraging mutual exchange in the future			0
motivating factors for prosocial actions include empathy , which is recognised to have deep evolutionary roots , altruism , practical considerations and self - interest			0
the study revealed that like children , chimpanzees learn kindness – a prosocial behaviour - by watching and experiencing the compassion of others			1
they defined prosocial behaviour as voluntary actions that benefit individuals or society , such as helping , sharing and co-operating with others			2
such actions are considered essential for maintaining effective communities , offering immediate benefit and encouraging mutual exchange in the future			0
for the study , participants were paired within each species and the responses of individuals accessing food rewards were analysed			0
researchers were interested in whether participants provided rewards to others and the quality of the rewards			0
they discovered that that young children and capuchin monkeys did n’t display any prosocial traits in certain situations , but that human adults gave their partner a more preferred reward even when they could only receive the less preferred reward			1
some children and chimpanzees who did n’t show kindness were partnered with others who showed generous behaviour towards them			1
they were later found to act more kindly themselves and were more likely to reward others			0
professor @entity41 said : ‘ we believe our study is the first to demonstrate that the prosocial behaviour of humans and non-human primates is shaped by the everyday social actions of those around them			0
‘ @entity152 may thrive , evolve and inspire when helping , sharing or donating are part of the cultural experience			0
' the chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys were studied at the @entity157 and the @entity33 ’ research centre in @entity159			2
monkey see , monkey do n't : the study revealed that capuchin monkeys ( stock image shown ) and young children did n’t display any prosocial traits in certain situations			1
but some children who failed to display kindness , showed generous behaviour after watching other kinder children			1

researchers from the @entity33 and @entity34 in @entity35 , showed chimpanzees learn kindness by watching each other
claim it *'s* the first evidence children and chimps share traits of altruism
in the experiment , pairs of chimps , monkeys , children and adults chose whether or not to reward each other with treats
study found that adults did but monkeys and young children did n't
children and chimps learned kind behaviour off more generous individuals
