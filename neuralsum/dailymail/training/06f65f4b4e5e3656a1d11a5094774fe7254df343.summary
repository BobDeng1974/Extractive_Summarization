‘ the skeleton was very badly preserved , ’ @entity25 , who excavated the young woman 's skeleton in 2009 , told the @entity28			0
‘ but the teeth were in an anatomical position , with the molars , pre-molars , canines and incisors			0
then there was this piece of metal			0
my first reaction was : what is this ? ’ the woman was buried in a well - furnished chamber , dating to the third century @entity43 , near the graves of three other women			0

this is a @entity66 @entity6 culture named after the archaeological site of @entity68 on the north side of @entity70 in @entity71			2
the culture developed and flourished during the @entity6 from 450 @entity73 to the @entity75 conquest in the 1st century @entity73			2

scientists believe the iron spike was pounded into the pulp canal of nerves and blood vessels to make sure it stayed in place			1
the procedure would have been excruciating had the lady been alive when it was performed			1
@entity105 corrodes inside the body , and one theory is that the lack of sterile conditions may have led to an infection that ended the young lady ’s life			1
the grave was one of four female burials in an enclosure dating to the third century @entity43 that were discovered dt in the @entity119 region of @entity8 , northern @entity9 another possible scenario is that the dental implant was fitted after her death for aesthetic reasons			2
