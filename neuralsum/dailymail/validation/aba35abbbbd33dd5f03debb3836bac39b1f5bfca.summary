a win is always a win and @entity1 will go into next week ’s game against @entity3 with a fighting chance of winning the @entity5 but they will be annoyed with themselves for leaving so many points out there on the field			1
it ’s all going to come down to points difference , and its nip and tuck with @entity13 , but those points @entity1 left out there at @entity15 could cost them dear			1
the biggest positive i would draw out of the game is that there was plenty of creativity – @entity21 and @entity22 led the way – and at least @entity1 were making try - scoring opportunities			1
this was no sterile kicking performance and with a bit more experience i 'm hoping @entity1 will start putting good teams away comfortably			2
@entity21 breaks away to score @entity1 's second try on a nerve - wracking afternoon @entity22 gave @entity1 options with a display of much - needed creativity against an obdurate @entity34 @entity35 in particular was composed and was confident enough to slow the game down on occasions to allow play to come to him			1
he ’s got time on the ball and some of @entity1 ’s other exciting young backs must look to emulate that the first half was extraordinary in many ways and spelt out the absolute necessity of taking your chances in @entity49 because it almost invariably comes back to haunt you			1
@entity1 started at a good tempo - which they definitely needed to after going behind early on in their last three @entity5 games - but they failed to take full advantage and put away three or four gilt - edge chances			1
@entity56 made a strong break in the first minute which should have led to a try but he showed no composure			0
he neither slowed down to allow @entity61 to get to him on his right nor did he look for @entity22 steaming up on his inside			2
instead he just went to ground and even then @entity1 did n’t recycle very well			0
@entity1 did score a fine try during this period which saw them at their best with @entity35 taking the ball to the line and @entity70 again showing that brilliant footwork of his to beat @entity72 but then the sloppiness crept in again			2
@entity70 scored @entity1 's first try to give the hosts hope of a rout , but that did not materialise @entity79 had been hungry for work and made an excellent initial burst but failed to transfer the ball to two hands which immediately limited his choice			2
he had the perfect arrowhead , support players on his left and right , but with the ball in one arm went to ground ineffectively			0
@entity1 also looked odds on to score at a scrum five having completely dominated @entity34 in the previous scrum but then inexplicably gave a penalty away for coming in on the angle			2
another try went begging when @entity94 got dragged down by @entity72			0
there ’ s no disgrace in being caught by @entity72 who is a real speed merchant and i ’m pretty sure @entity94 had lost a boot as well , but would like to have seen more support on his shoulder			0
almost predictably @entity34 hit back an scored with their very first serious attack to level the scores and in many ways @entity1 were possibly lucky to only trail 13 - 10 at half - time			1
that was definitely a yellow card when @entity110 stepped into play the ball earlier at a ruck when @entity34 were camped on @entity1 ’s line ! @entity94 looked to have broken free but was hauled back by the pacy @entity72 @entity116 leads an @entity1 breakaway with team - mates sprinting to joining in with his foray forward half - time will have been interesting in the @entity1 changing room and @entity1 looked a different beast for most of the second half and regained control of the match with @entity35 's try but then again we saw that lack of composure			1
@entity116 made a terrific break immediately after coming on as a replacement picking a wonderful angle but then lost his head completely and flung the wildest of passes to nowhere			0
yet again if he had just slowed down for a second and picked his support runner there would probably have been a try			0
moments later @entity61 was nearly through but again went to ground without looking for his support and @entity94 slightly over-ran that pass form @entity142 the furnace of international rugby you must play it cool on occasions finally at the end they killed @entity34 off with a well taken try by @entity1 should look carefully of why it took so long			2
@entity34 attempt to clear their lines with @entity154 ( right ) trying to block during the edgy encounter @entity1 back - row @entity156 evades the tackles of two @entity159 opponents good show : @entity1 will have to taken heart from the attacking intent if not the finishing			1
@entity79 worked very hard and took his late try well and @entity70 again demonstrated how he can unpick the tightest defences with his footwork			0
youngs and @entity35 were really lively at half - back , @entity154 added physicality up front bad show : @entity1 have to recapture the coolness under pressure and ruthless streak they showed in the second half against @entity176 in @entity177			1
that is what wins you big rugby matches			0
they made life so difficult for themselves with their lack of precision and not building a score			0
@entity34 took heart and scavenged like they always did .			0

@entity1 go into next week 's game with @entity3 with a fighting chance of winning the @entity5
but it is nip and tuck and their *inability* to score more against the @entity193 could come back to haunt them
there was plenty of creativity , with @entity22 and @entity21 both in good form
@entity1 trailed 10 - 13 at half - time but looked a different beast for most of the second half and regained control of the match to win *25* - 13
