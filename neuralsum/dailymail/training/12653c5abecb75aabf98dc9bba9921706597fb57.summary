if @entity2 really are serious top - four contenders , sunday ’s game against @entity1 will determine just how far they can go			1
the @entity2 spent @entity4 in dreamland ; fourth in the @entity6 for the first time ever and their highest league position during the festive period since 1985 , when they memorably went on to finish third with @entity9 but on @entity11 they crash landed and dropped to fifth in the table behind @entity13 after champions - elect @entity14 cruised to a comfortable victory			1
@entity17 has said that the hectic festive fixtures will give a good indication of @entity2 's ability @entity17 competes for a headed ball with @entity24 's @entity23 attacking midfielder @entity22 @entity17 was missing at @entity25 with a slight hamstring problem			1
but the 25 - year - old is battling to be fit for the @entity29 derby at @entity30 , for what will be his 200th appearance for the club he has proudly played for since the age of eight			1
win against @entity1 and local @entity35 boy @entity17 insists the result will go a long way to underlining @entity2 ’s @entity39 credentials			1
yet if they lose , there ’s a danger they could fall by the wayside			0
‘ the league does n’t really lie and i think the performances that we ’ve put on against the top teams have been exceptional like against @entity50 and @entity51 , ’ he says			0
‘ but this @entity4 period is important and you ’re going to see some teams fall by the wayside			2
‘ that just goes to show how important the squad is , especially at this time of year because you will pick up injuries and suspensions			2
‘ i ’ve been here since i was eight - years - old and , in a way , it ’s like a dream because @entity2 are not really meant to be up there - or so some people say			1
but we ’ve got a very good team and we expect a lot from ourselves			0
we deserve to be there though			0
then again , i do n’t think we expected to be where are to be honest with you			0
@entity72 's @entity71 ( left ) talks to the 25 - year - old defender ahead of the @entity2 ' clash with @entity1 @entity17 celebrates with former @entity76 striker @entity75 after the latter scored against @entity24 ‘ the position of where we are in the league has been great			1
it ’s probably been the best in the league since i started playing here but also the performances			0
they ’ve been some of the best we ’ve played as a team and as individuals			0
‘ if we keep heading in the way that we are at the moment then obviously we need to have that ambition to push for @entity93			0
’ @entity39 football is not the only ambition for @entity17			2
he ’s desperate the play for @entity97 , completing an international journey that has seen him represent his country at every age level - and for @entity100 at the @entity103 - bar the senior squad			1
his form this season has been outstanding			2
he scored his first goal in over two years against @entity108 earlier this month and @entity97 boss @entity109 must now be an admirer			2
but @entity17 knows he must continue to help @entity2 perform above expectations in the league if he is to stand any chance			1
sunday ’s potential duel with @entity1 striker @entity115 represents the perfect opportunity for him			1
and as an aficionado of the beautiful game - he ’s an avid viewer of @entity119 and all things football - @entity17 is under no illusions about the task ahead			1
‘ it would be nice to one day get that call - up but one thing ’s for sure , you need to keep playing well for your club , ’ he says			1
the central defender scored his first goal in over two years against @entity108 in early december the 25 - year - old 's @entity2 team - mates gather round to congratulate him after his goal against the @entity108 ‘ i ’ve seen @entity1 play quite a lot this season and i like to watch @entity135 football so , i ’ve seen @entity115 play for @entity136 and know what he ’s about			1
he ’s a proven player but has come and shown that in this league , which is n’t always easy to do			0
‘ but you ca n’t just focus on one man ’s attributes because @entity1 have quality all over the team			2
we ’re fully aware of how they are and it ’s a matter of not worrying too much about them and focus on ourselves			0
you have to focus our your performances on the pitch and that ’s what we have done so far this season and the results have been unbelievable			0
‘ i ’m 25 now but i feel i am still learning , experience-wise			2
i feel that the more games i ’ve played , the better i ’m getting			0
i ’ve been having a good run in the team at the moment and it ’s been nice to get some momentum going into each game			0
’ fifth or fourth in the league , it still remains a major fillip for manager @entity162 who this time last year faced strong calls from supporters to be sacked			1
and in light of the criticism sunday ’s opposing manager @entity168 has endured this season , @entity17 is quick to identify @entity2 ’s incredible rise up the table as proof to why clubs must stand by their manager - although he is still keen to crank up the pressure			1
‘ @entity1 have conceded goals more than should be doing for a team of that calibre and that ’s where we can hurt them because we ’ve got goals in abundance			2
@entity162 faced heavy criticism at points last season but has won over the disgruntled supporters the full interview with @entity17 can be read in the matchday programme ( left ) , available online for £ 3.50 ‘ but sometimes you can see managers come and go too quickly			1
‘ there ’s been cases where there are two or three managers at some clubs in a year and that ’s far too many			0
they need time to settle in			0
‘ @entity1 fans , just like any other fans , expect a lot from their team and expect trophies and to win games			2
@entity168 ’s done a great job there and i do n’t think that will ever be forgotten			0
so it ’s nice to see a team put their faith into their manager			0
he ’s been the longest - serving manager in the @entity6			1
‘ when a manager ’s doing all that he can and it ’s up to the players on the pitch to show what they can do			0
‘ with the bigger clubs that can be difficult because the expectations are higher			0
with ourselves , it ’s nice that the owners showed their faith in the @entity222 , because look at what he ’s done and what we ’ve achieved so far this season			0
’ it ’s not over yet and @entity17 knows it			2
but if it has anything to do with him , @entity2 will be marching on a @entity39 tour next year			1

@entity162 's @entity2 are fifth in the @entity6 table
and @entity17 has been an important part of the @entity2 ' form
but the 25 - year - old missed the 2 - 0 defeat by @entity14 due to injury
@entity17 *admitted* he hoped to receive and @entity97 call - up in the future
