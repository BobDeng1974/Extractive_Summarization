by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 wasps are increasingly optimistic they will be able to keep hold of their ‘ crown jewel ’ , @entity8 lock @entity7 , in light of their fine victory over champions @entity12			1
the 23 - year - old is out of contract at the end of the season and other clubs are permitted to officially approach him from january 1 , if he has not agreed a new deal with his current employers by then			1
saracens are thought to be monitoring the situation and @entity3 will be wary of losing another leading light to their @entity25 rivals , who lured @entity27 away last year			1
@entity7 of @entity3 in action during the @entity30 match against @entity31 wasps director of @entity33 looks on at @entity34 on sunday afternoon such is @entity37 ’s rising status in the game , there is sure to be a transfer - market scramble for his services if he becomes available , but @entity3 director of rugby @entity43 is hopeful			1
‘ i am very confident that he will stay , ’ said the @entity45			2
‘ it will be sorted , one way or the other , in the next couple of months			0
‘ he is the crown jewel and it would be a massive loss for us if we lost @entity7			1
if we did , we would have to move on , like we did with @entity27			2
a lot of people thought it was the end of the world when we lost @entity27 but we unearthed @entity57 would be mega , mega disappointed if @entity7 did leave , but we will do everything in our power to keep hold of him			1
i am confident that @entity7 will stay , but if it gets to @entity62 , i guess that is when you start to feel that things may not be going your way			1
’ sunday ’s result in @entity68 , where @entity3 stunned the @entity31 to win 20 - 16 , could prove a factor in helping them to keep hold of @entity37			1
he has asked for assurances about the stability and ambition of the club , and although the search for a permanent ground goes on , the financial outlook is more settled and the team are reviving			0
‘ @entity7 is not far off world - class now and no world - class second row wants to be involved in relegation fights every year , ’ said @entity43			1
‘ no world - class second row wants to be involved in the lower tiers of competition			2
no world - class second row wants to worry about what squad the club has got , or whether it is going to be here in six months			2
’ @entity7 of @entity3 runs at @entity12 and @entity8 flanker @entity94 @entity27 of @entity21 is tackled by @entity95 of @entity96 on friday night asked if he was concerned about the danger of lightning striking twice — after @entity27 appeared keen to stay at @entity3 , but then chose to join his brother @entity99 at @entity21 — @entity43 added : ‘ with @entity27 , the situation was slightly different			1
off the field , the club had a lot of difficulties and he could see the unstable position we were in			0
‘ the external factors were huge with that — the family were pulling @entity27 towards @entity21			0
i do n’t really see that being a factor with @entity112			0
knowing @entity7 as i do , i do n’t think he ’ll just go to the highest bidder — that is n’t in his nature			1
he will be more worried about what is right for his rugby			0
’ @entity30 clubs are poised to ratify an increase in the salary cap on wednesday — to a maximum of £ 5.5million			0
in addition , each club will be allowed to recruit a second ‘ excluded ’ player — whose salary is not counted within the cap			0
they must be new to the league next season , or have not played in the competition for at least 12 months			0
this opens the door for clubs to sign the likes of @entity135 or @entity136 from @entity137			0
@entity138 received good news on monday as a scan revealed their @entity8 wing , @entity142 , did not sustain significant ankle damage in the win over @entity145 , as first feared			2
instead , he has a minor foot issue , but may even be fit in time to face @entity147 at @entity148 on saturday			0
