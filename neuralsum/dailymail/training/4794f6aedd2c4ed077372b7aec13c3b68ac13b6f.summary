the woman received hundreds of messages from the man , with some referring to domestic abuse and ms @entity11 's murder			1
other messages suggested she leave her husband to marry him and have his child			2
the woman , who is a household name but can not be named for legal reason , was subjected to a campaign of harassment over social media and email for more than a year during which the man , who also can not be named , claimed they were having a ' cyber affair '			1
the trial at @entity1 today heard how the harassment even saw the defendant visit the tv studios where the woman worked to deliver gifts			1
it culminated in him kissing her at a public event			2
@entity42 , prosecuting , said : ' this case concerns obsessive behaviour on the part of the defendant directed towards a television presenter			2
' this obsessive behaviour manifested itself in the defendant 's use of the social network site @entity51 , in email communications and attending at her workplace and written communication to her address			0
' that behaviour went far beyond the respectful enthusiasm of a fan			0
' he caused her significant alarm or distress that had a substantial effect on her day - to - day life			0
' the court heard how the defendant began contacting the celebrity about her programmes and she replied out of courtesy , although the messages then became increasingly personal			1
the presenter , who is in her 40s , made a statement to police in december last year , shortly before the man was arrested			2
mr @entity42 said : ' she recalled the first communication from him being a tweet sent in january 2012			0
' she had just been on television and the tweet was saying " you look lovely i simply have to say so "			2
' she began receiving emails to her work address , again replying to the messages out of respect for her fans			1
the messages took another turn in february 2012 , when the man began speaking about his personal issues and invited her to go the @entity90 exhibition at the @entity91 in @entity2			1
in the march of the same year , his messages took a sinister turn with an email referring to a segment on @entity96 , which was brought in to help victims of violent domestic abuse			2
he also attached the first chapters of his autobiography and his mobile number asking for her to call him			0
she stopped replying to the messages , but days later , on march 15 , he wrote to her again with the chilling reference to murdered presenter @entity11			2
mr @entity42 said : ' the email contained a transcript purporting to be a telephone call from someone called @entity110 and he referred to the discovery that @entity11 , the tv presenter , had been murdered			0
' the @entity113 presenter was shot dead , aged 37 , outside her home in @entity115 , west @entity2 , in april 1999			1
mr @entity42 continued : ' [ he wrote ] ' i hope that wa n't too freaky a start to the day , do n't let it be s * * * e , that 's like a one - in - a - million thing anyway			0
( sic ) ' the email was passed on to the station 's security and he was blocked from emailing any of its email address			0
@entity1 ( pictured ) heard how the woman was subjected to a campaign of harassment over social media and email for more than a year during which the man claimed they were having a ' cyber affair ' however , he continued to message her through third parties , the court heard			1
another email , sent in march 2012 , described his love for her and blamed a co-presenter for being blocked from the email system			0
mr @entity42 said : ' [ the email ] is a declaration of love and adoration for her and suggests that she divorces her husband , marries him and they could have a child together			0
' he carried on contacting the woman saying they were having a ' cyber affair ' and invited her to use an anonymous messaging system			0
the court heard that although the harassment began in early 2012 , he stands charged with the crimes from november that year , when stalking became a criminal offence			1
jurors were told the alleged stalker was not accused of threatening violence against the celebrity , although his obsessive communication caused her ' serious alarm or distress '			0
the court also heard how in december 2012 , he visited the tv studios where she worked to deliver hand - warmers and a @entity177 card and letter , but was turned away			1
the celebrity chose to go to the police after the defendant approached her at an event at the @entity183 and kissed her , jurors were told			1
mr @entity42 said : ' he thrust a copy of a programme into her hands and asked her for an autograph then , in her words , " landed a sloppy wet kiss on my cheek "			1
' she tried to shrug it off but over time decided to take it to the police			0
' that 's what prompted her to install further security measures and alter her activities			0
