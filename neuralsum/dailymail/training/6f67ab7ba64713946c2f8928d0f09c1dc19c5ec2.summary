the reptile , whose species is known to prey on rodents in the wild , had to be rushed to the vets in @entity21 , @entity22 , after swallowing the tiny toy dog whole			1
' the toy is @entity11 ’s favourite and he is so playful he flipped it up in the air hoping that @entity6 would join in and play with him			2
' @entity42 obviously saw it move quickly and @entity43 are used to catching food in the wild so he stretched up and grabbed it			0
' he swallowed it down no problem at all			0
he did n’t have any breathing problems but i knew he would be unable to pass it so we had to get to the vets as soon as possible			0
