the influx of migrants from @entity2 has fuelled a huge rise in the number of schoolchildren who do not speak @entity6 as a first language			1
in five years between 2008 and 2013 the number of @entity2 pupils who do n’t speak @entity6 at home almost tripled from just over 44,000 to more than 123,000			1
astonishingly , one in nine @entity6 schools now has a majority of pupils who do not speak @entity6 as a first language			1
the official figures lay bare the enormous strain mass migration has placed on our schools			0
top 10 languages poll the number of pupils who speak @entity23 as a first language has seen the steepest increase – rising 527 per cent in five years			1
the number using @entity27 at home has risen by 255 per cent			1
however , the @entity30 figures – obtained by the @entity31 under freedom of information laws – only cover the five years before labour market restrictions on both countries were lifted last month , meaning the trend looks set to continue			0
schools are already struggling to cope with the demand for places , with some having to teach pupils in temporary classrooms			2
official estimates suggest that more than one million extra places will be needed in @entity43 over the next decade , which will bring the total required to eight million by 2022 , the highest for 40 years			0
the government is already having to spend £ 5billion by 2015 on increasing the number of places to help ease the crisis			0

educating children who do not speak @entity6 as their mother tongue also puts a huge financial strain on schools			2
the cost of educating a non-native speaker has been estimated at up to £ 30,000 a year , compared to around £ 5,000 for other pupils , because of the need for intensive classroom assistance			0
@entity68 , of think - tank @entity69 , warned the strain on resources was damaging the education of both @entity6 children and those from recent migrant families			0
‘ in too many cases our schools are simply not set up to accommodate very high proportions of children who start school without fluent @entity6 , ’ she said			2
‘ those who lose out most in this scenario are these very pupils , as they do n’t receive adequate opportunities to develop their @entity6 language skills and are therefore at risk of going through the education system at a significant disadvantage			1
in turn , in an environment where teachers are struggling to cope because they are not given the time and facilities they need to strengthen language , those pupils for whom @entity6 is their first language can also suffer educationally and by default be neglected			1
’ @entity99 , chairman of the @entity100 @entity6 , said non-english speaking immigrant children ‘ often bring an excellent work ethic to the classroom ’			0
but he said : ‘ it means a lot of teacher time has to be spent addressing language issues			0
’ the total number of pupils whose second language is @entity6 went up by a fifth to 1.1million between january 2008 and january 2013			1
educating children who do not speak @entity6 as their mother tongue also puts a huge financial strain on schools nine of the ten fastest - growing foreign first languages are from @entity2 – the exception being the southern @entity120 language of @entity121			1
the second highest increase in pupils with @entity6 as a second language was among @entity125 , on 414 per cent , followed by @entity126 , with 359 per cent			1
in both cases exact numbers were not recorded initially as they were below 1,000 – suggesting the percentage increase could be even higher			0
rising demand for school places has been caused by a growing birthrate , immigration and the fact that ever fewer middle - class families can afford private education			0
but as well as the number of families migrating to @entity43 , further pressure is created by the high birthrate among those families once they have moved , the @entity137 has said			0
@entity23 women on average have 2.93 children here compared to 1.25 at home			0
@entity43 women average 1.84 children			0
