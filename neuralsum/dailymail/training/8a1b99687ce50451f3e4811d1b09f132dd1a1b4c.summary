in an interview for the campaign , @entity23 says she relies on ' lots of very fine pashminas , serious moisturisers , sturdy boots , four wheel drive and a cashmere coat ' when it 's cold outside			2

' i love the elements actually , ' she says			0
' i think we should embrace them rather than see them as a challenge , which could also be because i am really lazy ; mind you a good moisturiser is always handy			0
' she says that while she does n't follow fashion trends so much , she will be ' chanelling her inner rock chick ' this season			0
