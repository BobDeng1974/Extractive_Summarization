@entity0 left it late to stage a dramatic comeback against @entity3 and keep their @entity4 hopes on track			1
the @entity6 were heading for a shock loss after @entity8 opened the scoring for the hosts in the 71st minute but a @entity12 equaliser and a @entity14 strike completed the turnaround in the dying embers of the match			2
@entity18 was superb in goal for @entity21 's side as the third - choice goalkeeper made his @entity24 debut			1
here @entity26 's @entity25 gives his verdict on how the players performed			0
@entity0 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity29 superb night with no nerves and he kept @entity0 in the game			2
@entity18 had a sublime goal in for @entity0 - in only his third appearance for the club @entity35 - 6.5 bad night but provided a great cross for @entity12 ' equaliser			1
per @entity38 - 6.5 kept defence together in the first half but was less successful in second			0
@entity42 - 6 , satisfactory performance , given that he ’s out of position at centre - back			0
@entity12 - 7 at fault for goal , but what a finish for the equaliser ! @entity12 started @entity0 's dramatic comeback scoring a beautiful volley with minutes remaining @entity53 - 5.5 struggled in his first start back for the @entity6 from injury			1
@entity56 - 5.5 organised things as well he could but little impact otherwise on midfield			0
@entity60 - 5.5 passing awry , the midfield could n’t get a grip of the game			0
@entity64 was full of energy as the @entity6 clawed their way back into the match @entity64 - 6.5 always energetic , always showing : vital contribution for the winner			2
@entity70 - 6 started well but faded away , as @entity0 lost control of the game			0
@entity73 - 5.5 not his greatest night : peripheral , missed 64th minute chance			0
@entity73 was largely ineffectual for the @entity77 side against @entity3 on wednesday night substitutes @entity79 ( 76 , for @entity70 ) - 5.5 could n’t really make an impact on the game @entity14 ( 84 , for @entity60 ) - 8 superb			1
just when @entity0 needed him , he popped up @entity84 ( 76 for @entity56 ) - 7 eventually found those driving runs to trouble @entity3 @entity14 produced a stellar substitute appearance - scoring the @entity6 ' winner late on @entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity89 6 ; @entity90 6 , @entity91 7 , @entity92 6.5 , @entity93 6 ; @entity94 6.5 @entity95 6 ; @entity8 , @entity96 7.5 @entity97 6.5 ; @entity98 5.5 subs : @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106			1
