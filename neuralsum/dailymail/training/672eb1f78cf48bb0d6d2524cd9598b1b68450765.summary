the future of @entity2 was uncertain today after a federal court in @entity0 struck down tax subsidies for @entity5 who bought insurance through federally - funded exchanges			1
within hours the same policy was held up by another court , setting up a @entity12 showdown			1
the cases revolve around four words in the @entity2 , which says the tax credits are available to people who enroll through an exchange ' established by the state			2
' the rulings affect consumers who purchased their coverage through the federal insurance marketplace - or exchange - that serves 36 states			1
if the first ruling is upheld by the nation 's high court , more than half of the 8 million @entity5 who purchased taxpayer - subsidized insurance under the law could see premium increases			1
americans who are covered through the federal exchange will see no immediate changes to their policies , however , as the courts sort out the issue			0
' in the meantime , to be clear , people getting premium tax credits should know that nothing has changed			0
tax credits remain available , ' @entity44 spokeswoman @entity43 said in a statement after the first ruling			0
the majority opinion concluded that the law , as written , ' unambiguously ' restricts subsides to consumers in exchanges established by a state			1
that would invalidate an @entity80 regulation that tried to sort out confusing wording in the law by concluding that @entity83 intended for consumers in all 50 states to have subsidized coverage			1
the subsidies , in the form of tax credits , are available to people with annual incomes of up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level , or $ 94,200 for a family of four			1
causing further uncertainty is a decision by the 4th @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , that was handed down this afternoon			1
that court said in a unanimous ruling that tax subsidies are indeed available people who bought their insurance through the federal exchanges			1
the seemingly arcane issue is crucial to the success of the health law because most states have been unable or unwilling to set up their own exchanges			1
the small business owners who challenged the law through the @entity0 court say a literal reading of its language invalidates the @entity80 subsidy to people in the federal exchanges			1
the opponents say that people who would otherwise qualify for the tax credits should be denied that benefit if they buy insurance on a federally facilitated exchange			2
' it is implausible to believe that @entity83 gave the @entity80 discretion to authorize $ 150 billion per year in federal spending , particularly when @entity83 had directly spoken to this issue , ' the @entity125 court challengers said in a court filing			2
' major economic decisions like these - indeed , any decisions granting tax credits - must be made unambiguously by @entity83 itself			0
' the @entity51 administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the @entity2 say the challengers are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety			0
' it is pretty obvious what the congressional intent was here , ' @entity143 press secretary @entity142 said , which was for every qualified @entity5 to receive a subsidy ' regardless of whether it was state officials or federal officials running the marketplace			2
' @entity154 said the @entity0 ruling is ' at odds with the goal of the law			2
' ' we believe that this decision is incorrect , inconsistent with @entity83 intent , ' the @entity44 official said			0
the @entity51 administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the @entity2 say the challengers to the law are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety an appeals court filing by congressional and state legislative supporters of the @entity2 , similarly argues that ' @entity83 did not provide that the tax credits would only be available to citizens whose states set up their own exchanges			1
' congressional lawmakers and state legislators who are against the law hope that by limiting the subsidies to state exchanges , they can destabilize important aspects of the law , such as the individual mandate requiring most people to buy insurance			1
@entity189 , a senior circuit court judge serving on the @entity97 court , explained the court 's decision this way : ' if i ask for pizza from @entity196 for lunch but clarify that i would be fine with a pizza from @entity199 's , and i then specify that i want ham and pepperoni on my pizza from @entity196 , my friend who returns from @entity199 's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a literal construction of my lunch order			2
' @entity189 and his colleagues voted to uphold what the @entity51 administration says was the ' intent ' of law - subsidies for all qualified @entity5 , regardless of whether they signed up for coverage through the state or federal exchanges			1
' today ’s ruling highlights the ramifications of hastily passing legislation before fully knowing and understanding what it entails and how it will affect people , ' @entity218 chair @entity217 said in a statement after the @entity0 decision was handed down			2
' for months , people all across this country have seen firsthand the flawed and ineffective implementation of @entity2 – in their skyrocketing premiums , lost coverage , limited access , and regulatory inefficiencies			0
' and today ’s decision is only further evidence of the legislation ’s failure , ' the @entity235 leader said			0
' it ’s time to listen to the @entity5 people , enact real health care reforms , and start over			2
this law does not work			0
' @entity189 , a senior circuit court judge who wrote a concurring opinion on the @entity97 court 's decision , said he was not going to allow @entity248 advocates to use the court to deny ' millions of @entity5 desperately - needed health insurance			1
' @entity189 admitted that the federal law was ' tortured ' and it 's construction was ' nonsensical ' but it 's ' manifest purpose , as revealed by the wholeness and coherence of its text and structure , could not be more clear			0
' in an attempt to explain the law in lay terms , @entity189 offered up an equally tortured pizza - based analogy			0
' if i ask for pizza from @entity196 for lunch but clarify that i would be fine with a pizza from @entity199 's , and i then specify that i want ham and pepperoni on my pizza from @entity196 , my friend who returns from @entity199 's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a literal construction of my lunch order , ' he said			0
judges on the @entity0 case were @entity277 , an appointee of president @entity278 ; @entity279 , an appointee of @entity278 's father ; and @entity282 , an appointee of president @entity283 , who dissented			0
a lower court had ruled that the law 's text , structure , purpose , and legislative history make ' clear that @entity83 intended to make premium tax credits available on both state - run and federally - facilitated @entity292			2
' but the appeals court concluded the opposite - that the letter of the law ' unambiguously restricts ' the law 's subsidies to policies sold through exchanges established by the state			1
' an exchange established by the federal government can not possibly be " an exchange established by the @entity305 , " ' @entity279 wrote in a concurring opinion			0
' to hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion , not interpretation			0
' only further legislation could accomplish the expansion the government seeks			0
' in a statement celebrating the @entity0 court 's decision , @entity315 , general counsel for the @entity316 , one of the organization 's responsible for funding the lawsuit said , ' the court ’s decision puts an end to the power grab that the @entity80 rule represented			1
' and more importantly it reaffirms the fact that we are a nation of laws enacted by @entity83 rather than rules issued by agenda - driven agencies , ' @entity315 added			0
' despite all the political calls for the country to ' get with the program and support @entity2 , " it ’s the @entity335 who have the last word			0

the @entity0 , @entity0 court of appeals ruled that the law , as written , only allows insurance subsidies in states that have set up their own exchanges
an appeals court in @entity97 , @entity98 ruled unanimously that people who purchased coverage through the federal exchanges are also *eligible* for subsides
the cases could end up before the @entity5 @entity12
affected states include some of the most *populous* : @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 and @entity358
