by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:01 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 12:44 est , 26 march 2013 virgin trains are to continue running on the @entity4 mainline until 2017 , five years after sir @entity5 was supposed to lose the right to operate @entity8 ’s biggest stretch of track			1
ministers today admitted they have torn up the timetable for awarding a dozen lucrative franchises after unearthing systemic failures in the way multi-billion pound bidding competitions were handled			0
transport secretary @entity16 also revealed plans to put the @entity19 main line back into private hands , after it was nationalised by the @entity23 government in 2009			1
scroll down to watch the @entity25 speech more delays : in an attempt to finally get a grip on the multi-billion bidding process to run @entity8 's railways , it was announced @entity33 trains are to run the @entity4 line until 2017 unveiling an overhauled franchise process today , mr @entity16 confirmed a series of delays to stop a repeat of the debacle over the @entity4 line			1
the contest to run @entity42 services has been put back from april 2014 to june 2018 while the @entity44 franchise , run by @entity45 and due to end in october this year , will not start until july 2016			1
the @entity47 franchise , due to end in april 2014 , will not begin until february 2016			0
the first of the new franchises to start will be @entity50 , where the franchise ends in may this year and will begin in september 2014			0
details of the new franchise timetable reveal a string of delays transport secretary @entity16 put the brakes on the entire contracts process after discovering ' significant flaws ' the decision - making process about which firms run the nation ’s railways were plunged into chaos last summer when ministers announced that @entity33 had lost the @entity4 franchise			1
@entity45 was awarded the £ 13billion , 13 - year deal in august but @entity33 launched a legal challenge			0
as officials prepared for the @entity70 proceedings , ‘ significant technical flaws ’ in the contract competition were unearthed			0
in particular major mistakes were made in the use of inflation and passenger numbers , with different firms given different data			0
three civil servants were suspended and the deal was halted			0
with taxpayers facing a compensation bill of up to £ 100million , mr @entity16 initially asked sir @entity5 to continue running services until early 2014 but today the government admitted a new operator will not now take over until 2017			1
it was the chaos surrounding the @entity4 deal which triggered two independent reviews - one on the @entity4 fiasco and the other on the whole franchise process			1
rail minister @entity93 said he was confident the new contest would be ' cock - up free '			0
he told @entity95 : ' we have learnt the lessons of past mistakes with the @entity4 and so that we can move forward			2
' @entity100 chief executive @entity99 said : ' the time for passenger power has come			0
for too long passengers have been the passive recipients of major decisions made on their behalf behind closed doors			0
' the voice of the user - and main funder - of the railways should be radically boosted in a process that needs to be opened up to scrutiny			0
we are going to work with @entity114 to make this a reality			0
' today 's announcement is the direct result of the reviews and effectively sets the franchise process back on track			0
@entity122 , @entity23 ’s shadow transport secretary , said : ' the full scale of the chaos caused by the government ’s rail franchising fiasco has now been revealed with almost every contract delayed by up to a staggering fifty months			1
' ministers have still not come clean about the full extent of the losses facing taxpayers as a result of this scandal , despite many industry experts putting the likely cost at well over £ 100 million and a series of legal disputes yet to be settled			0
' the announcement is a fresh boost for sir @entity5 's virgin trains , just months after being told it had lost the bidding war in a statement to mps , mr @entity16 said : ‘ this programme is a major step in delivering tangible improvements to services , providing long - term certainty to the market and supporting our huge programme of rail investment			1
‘ above all , in future franchise competitions we are placing passengers in the driving seat by ensuring that their views and satisfaction levels are taken into account when deciding which companies run our railway services			2
the move to return the @entity19 mainline to private hands ends the modern experiment in the government running services for the first time since the privatisation of @entity168			1
in 2009 @entity169 walked away from the @entity19 franchise , and the @entity23 government took control of services			1
a new government - owned company , @entity174 , was created and has run the services ever since			2
it recorded a seven per cent rise in profits to £ 7.1 million in 2011 - 12			0
in the four weeks to august 19 , 93 per cent of @entity19 trains were on time up from 87 per cent on 2011			2
the four - hour @entity180 express service from @entity182 to @entity183 ( pictured ) was reinstated and extra services to @entity185 and @entity186 were introduced			2
the apparent success of the state - running of services caused the @entity191 transport union to call for the same to happen on the @entity4 line			1
@entity174 overhauled the @entity19 timetable , introducing almost 20 new weekday services			2
but ministers have now announced it will be run by a private company from february 2015			2
‘ franchising has been a force for good in the story of @entity8 's railways , transforming an industry that was in decline into one that today carries record numbers of passengers			0
’ in a surprise move , the government hopes to put the @entity19 line back in private hands in less than two years			1
the line - a key @entity183 to @entity212 route - has been run under the control of the @entity214 since november 2009 after transport company @entity169 pulled out			1
mr @entity16 announced the ‘ immediate start of the competition ’ for the @entity19 franchise with an expected start of service by the new operator in february 2015			1
rail unions reacted with dismay to the @entity19 news , pointing out that the private sector had twice given up the franchise , with @entity226 pulling out some years ago			1
they also highlighted the fact that the taxpayer is likely to have to foot a bill as high as £ 50 million over the botched @entity4 franchise			2
@entity191 general secretary @entity232 said : ‘ despite wasting hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money on the franchising circus , and instead of learning the lessons of the privatisation disasters on the @entity19 and @entity4 main lines and across the rest of the network , the government has this morning given the green light to a whole new wave of profiteering that will have the train companies laughing all the way to the bank			1
‘ the proposed reprivatisation of the @entity19 , after the public sector rescued the service following two private failures , proves conclusively that the political class have learnt absolutely nothing when it comes to our railways			2
‘ this is a politically - inspired wrecking move designed to flog off this publicly - owned intercity route before the next election regardless of the consequences			1
’ @entity261 , leader of the @entity263 rail union , said : ‘ the @entity264 are just like the @entity265 when it comes to rail - they ignore all the lessons of history			0
‘ the £ 50 million west coast line fiasco revealed that private franchises are a shambles			2
so they go and privatise the only successful publicly - owned franchise , the @entity19 line			1
‘ this is an act of political spite to reward their friends in the @entity279 and to tie the hands of an incoming @entity23 government in 2015			0
the most expensive rail network in @entity283 is about to get even more expensive			0
’ the @entity4 debacle pitted @entity285 against @entity45 against each other , with @entity33 emerging as the main beneficiary of the delays to awarding the £ 13boillion contract @entity291 general secretary @entity290 , who chairs the action for @entity168 campaign said : ' this decision defies all logic			1
since returning to public ownership the @entity19 has flourished with passenger numbers and customer satisfaction increasing and all profits re-invested back into improving the service			2
' the government , however , is not interested in evidence - based policy and is once again putting the interests of private companies and shareholders before those of commuters and taxpayers			0
' this is privatisation for privatisation ’s sake , as ministers steadfastly ignore what is best for the rail industry and the people who work on it and use it			0

decision on who will run @entity4 services delayed until 2017 , says transport secretary @entity16
@entity19 line returned to private hands after being nationalised in 2009
passenger groups hope end of *uncertainty* will finally secure much - needed and delayed investment
unions attack ' wrecking move ' of ending state - run services
