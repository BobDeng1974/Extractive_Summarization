by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:43 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 11:49 est , 25 january 2013 @entity3 boss @entity2 defended the idea of delaying bankers bonus payouts to avoid paying tax the head of @entity3 has defended an aborted plan to avoid millions of pounds in tax on bankers ’ bonuses , comparing it to shrewd house - selling			1
@entity2 risked a fresh public backlash by saying he stood by the move to delay huge payouts until after the top rate of tax was cut from 50p to 45p			1
the chief executive of the investment bank claimed opposition to the idea amounted to ‘ criminalising every right - thinking person who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way ’			0
two weeks ago @entity3 was forced to abandon its plan to delay paying out bonuses to help bankers avoid the 50p tax rate			1
@entity32 boss sir @entity31 branded the idea ' depressing ' and accused bankers of mis - judging public anger at the damage caused by the financial crash			1
the investment bank had considered waiting to award equity bonuses deferred from previous years , due to pay out this month , until after april 6			2
it would have meant tax on the payouts would have been paid at the 45p rate instead of the 50p rate for high earners			1
but at the eleventh how the bank 's @entity46 pulled the plug on the plan			2
unrepentant , mr @entity2 insisted people should not be subjected to opprobrium for responding to incentives in the tax system			2
a plan by @entity3 to delay the payouts of deferred bonuses until after april 6 was dropped two weeks ago ‘ we do n't go out of our way to put our businesses in the most expensive jurisdictions			2
do we go out of our way to put them in the least expensive ? no , we think of quality , we think of standard of life , being able to attract and recruit , ’ he told @entity58			0
‘ if all of a sudden , in addition to the rules that generate certainty for people , the signposts become so amorphous and so loose and so subject to second - guessing , you 're making everything uncertain and it 's very hard to organise your affairs in a sensible way			0
@entity32 chief sir @entity31 said bankers had to realise they ' ca n't just exist on their own ' ‘ i 'm not saying that you are exculpated from any pressure merely because you meet the rule of law - we 've never said that , we do n't live that life			1
‘ but i would say are you going to hold people up to public opprobrium because a house they could have sold in january instead they sell in may because there was a profit to be made on that house because the selling price was higher than the purchase price ? ‘ if you do that , you are going to criminalise every right - thinking person who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way			0
‘ we are a public entity , we live on the goodwill of the public , and so we adapted to what we perceived as criticism			0
we stand by our original idea and we stand by the revision of our plans			0
’ when news of the plan to delay bonuses first emerged , outgoing @entity32 government sir @entity31 launched a devastating attack on attitudes in the @entity111			1
he accused the super-rich of thinking it was ' exciting ' to use a loophole which could cost the taxpayer millions			0
' i find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think it 's even more exciting to kind of adjust the timing of it to get the benefit of a lower tax rate which they will benefit from in the long run to a very great extent , ' he told the @entity128			0
sir @entity31 , who will stand down as @entity32 governor in june , said @entity111 firms had to consider the reputational damage the move would cause			1
' i think it would be rather clumsy and rather lacking in care and attention to how other people might react and , in the long run , financial institutions , like all large institutions do depend on good will from the rest of society , they ca n’t just exist on their own			0

@entity2 said he stood by the idea of delaying bonuses until the 50p top rate of tax had been cut to 45p
after public backlash bank dropped the plan earlier this month
