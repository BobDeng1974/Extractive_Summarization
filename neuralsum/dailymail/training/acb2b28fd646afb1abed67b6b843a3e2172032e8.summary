by @entity1 reporter published : 11:11 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 11:18 est , 9 may 2012 @entity2 with mother @entity3 : the youngster had 13 operations on her oesophagus to widen it a three - year - old girl suffers from a rare digestive condition which means she ca n't gobble down her food - because it could kill her			1
@entity11 must carefully chew every mouthful because she is unable to swallow properly and is liable to choke			0
the condition means it takes her four minutes to eat a single strawberry			0
her mother @entity3 , 26 , first noticed something was wrong when she was breast feeding @entity2 and realised her daughter had turned purple and lifeless			1
doctors found a small pouch at the top of the youngster ’s oesophagus and which meant her baby milk was spilling into her trachea and lungs - causing pneumonia			1
then when she started eating solids it was impossible for @entity2 to have a mouthful without choking			1
now , after 13 life - changing operations to disconnect her trachea and oesophagus from each other , @entity2 is learning how to eat normally for the first time			1
medics have warned the youngster she must chew her food at least four times longer than a normal child or she would have to be rushed to hospital to have any blockages surgically removed			0
the rare condition , a combination of @entity46 ( @entity47 ) and @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , means it takes @entity2 four minutes to eat just one strawberry			1
while most youngsters are warned against drinking coke , @entity2 often relies on the fizzy drink to help her force the food down			1
she is also encouraged to eat chocolate and soft crisps , like @entity58 and @entity59 , because they are less likely to cause choking			0
meal times regularly take longer than an hour with @entity2 taking longer to finish each mouthful than her little brother @entity63 , one			1
the condition also means when @entity2 starts primary school in september she is likely to have no time left during her lunch hour to play outside with pals once she had finished eating			1
her family are already trying to arrange an extra dinner lady for the local primary school - just to watch over @entity2 while she eats			1
@entity3 held @entity2 for the first time when she was eight days old doctors have already told the family the condition will never disappear , which means - even as an adult - @entity2 will be forced to take toddler sized bites of her food			1
full - time mother @entity3 said : ' now @entity2 does enjoy eating , but sometimes it is difficult to keepher going as she has to chew for so long			1
' @entity3 added : ' when i first fed @entity2 i was shocked to see her go purple and lifeless			1
i did n’t know what was wrong with her			0
@entity2 can not eat carrots , mango , melon and rice in case they get stuck ' we feel that we have come a long way and @entity2 is stable			1
we worry less now as she is old enough to tell us if she has got something stuck			0
' chewing for @entity2 is a matter of life or death			2
if she gets something stuck she will cough and panic			0
it is very scary to watch			0
' we try to make it fun for @entity2 - we tell her ‘ @entity98 , chew , chew ’ so she remembers			2
she knows that she was ill as a baby - i think the more she knows the better			0
' @entity2 , who lives with her mother @entity3 , father @entity102 , 26 , a personal trainer and little brother @entity63 in @entity104 , @entity105 , was born by caesarean after a two - day labour			2
doctors diagnosed her with @entity47 and @entity49 when @entity2 was one day old and aged just two days old she underwent an eight - hour - long operation			2
surgeons at @entity111 carried out an oesophageal atresia to divide the tracheo - oesophageal fistula and performed a primary anastomosis to join the two ends of the oesophagus			0
@entity2 was allowed to go home from hospital 14 days after the operation , but she kept bringing milk up when @entity3 fed her			2
still concerned @entity3 took @entity2 to @entity111 where doctors discovered her oesophagus had in fact closed over and they had to gradually widen it over a number of weeks			1
@entity47 is a condition where the bottom end of a baby ’s oesophagus is joined to its trachea			2
without surgical intervention , this causes air to pass from the windpipe to the food - pipe and stomach and can also allow stomach acid to pass into the lungs			0
some babies like @entity2 also have oa a condition where a baby is born with a pouch at the top of its oesophagus which prevents food from reaching the stomach			1
this pouch can fill up with food and saliva and eventually overflow into the baby ’s trachea and enter the lungs and cause choking			0
@entity2 also developed pneumonia and other complications and had to be fed by a tube into her stomach for the first year of her life			2
so far she has had 13 operations on her oesophagus , which is smaller than an average child ’s - and will require further surgery throughout her life			1
her oesophagus is smaller in diameter where the two parts were surgically joined together so she has to chew her food carefully so it fits through the gap			0
@entity2 can not eat carrots , mango , melon , rice or slippery foods as they are difficult to pull out of her throat if they get stuck			1
when she was one - year - old @entity2 would choke more than 12 times every day , but now she had learnt to chew her food for longer and manage her condition			2
now on a bad week @entity2 will choke 20 times , but on a good week she may only choke once			2
when she chokes her mother @entity3 has to try and pull the food out of her throat			0
if the mouthful ca n’t be reached surgeons have warned her airways can only be unblocked by surgery to cut the blockage from her throat			0
@entity3 said : ' @entity2 ’s favourite food is lasagne			2
the best crisps for her to eat are @entity58 or @entity59 as they melt in her mouth - chocolate is good for that too			0
' the other day my mother drank some tea and it went down the wrong way and @entity2 told her ‘ you must chew ’ ' birthday parties are quite scary for us as parents as you never know what is going be in the party bags			0
' i am nervous about her going to school and i hope she will be able to eat her lunch			0
' @entity2 ’s family are raising money for the @entity199 who run @entity201 at @entity111 where they stayed for four months during her treatment			0
