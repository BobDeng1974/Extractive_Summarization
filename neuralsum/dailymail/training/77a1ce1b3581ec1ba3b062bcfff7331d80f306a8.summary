a powerful group of @entity2 fighters in @entity3 have released a professionally made video showing the training programme their fighters are going through at a ' @entity7			1
' the @entity9 video includes fighters abseiling down rock faces , descending on zip wires , and masked men clearing buildings in the style of @entity17 - trained special forces			2
the video , initially released by @entity20 speakers , suggests that the rebels are receiving training from an established military power – probably @entity24 – and have built what they call a ' @entity7			1
the men can be seen on marksmanship exercises , launching assaults from the back of an armoured personnel carrier and in a wood in full camouflage			2
they show off using nunchucks – a wooden handled weapon from the @entity69 - and demonstrate unarmed combat skills , and crawl along the ground as tanks pass over them			0
the video finishes with a shot of a bearded cameraman in a baseball cap , equipped with the latest digital camera , as he follows fighters on an exercise and words on the screen promise ' part 2 coming soon			2
' soldiers are seen rehearsing how to destroy a tank as it drives over the top of them ( tank pictured right ) recruits are seen taking part in @entity17 - style training exercises , such as abseiling down cliffs the video ends with the ominous message that ' part 2 ' will be coming soon the film is designed as a recruitment aid to show that the forces of a grouping called the @entity100 are better trained and equipped that their rivals in the @entity102 ( @entity102 )			1
according to @entity103 of the analysts @entity104 , the @entity100 could have as many as 45,000 fighters under its command			0
it was formed last november as an umbrella group for a number of @entity2 factions fighting in various cities in @entity3 including the @entity112 , based in @entity113 , and a fundamentalist group called @entity115			0
the video goes to great pains to show off the professional recording equipment being used by @entity35 , including @entity120 - style camera rigs the final shot of the video shows troops moving through the woods , before the shot comes to rest on a bearded man with a high - tech camera filming them @entity35 have made use of high quality footage before , such as the execution videos of @entity132 and @entity133 which drew international media attention initially the group pledged to work with the mainstream group the @entity136 , but they raided warehouses run by the @entity136 in @entity138 weeks after they were formed , seizing equipment supplied by the @entity140 and leading to a suspension of supplies to the @entity136 by @entity143 and others			1
they have since reconciled with the @entity136 and are considered by @entity146 powers to be an essential bulwark against the rise of the more fanatical group , @entity102			0
however , demonstrating the complex nature of the opposition groups , they seek to establish a state ruled by shariah law and at least one senior member has professed to links with @entity157 .			0
