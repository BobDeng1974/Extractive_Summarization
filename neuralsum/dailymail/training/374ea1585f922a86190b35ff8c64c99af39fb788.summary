a growing controversy surrounding the results of the ladies ’ free skate in @entity4 this week reached a fever pitch after images surfaced showing a @entity8 judge hugging her 17 - year - old compatriot just moments after her surprise victory			1
the stills were taken from thursday 's @entity13 coverage by the @entity15 tv channel @entity14			2
in the pictures , skating judge @entity16 is seen warmly embracing @entity18 , who skated to victory over reigning @entity13 champion @entity20 , of @entity15			1
the compromising images have caused an uproar among @entity15 on @entity47 and in local media			0
while the cuddle does not suggest in any way that miss @entity16 had judged the free skate unfairly , critics have said that rushing backstage to congratulate her compatriot in full view of cameras was a bad judgment call			1
beside her role as a long - time @entity32 judge , @entity16 is also the wife of general director of the @entity60			2
meanwhile , more than 1.9million people have signed a @entity63 petition demanding that an investigation into the judging decisions in thursday night 's women 's figure skating competition be opened			1

controversial win : @entity18 of @entity8 ( center ) , @entity20 of @entity15 ( left ) and @entity76 of @entity77 stand on the podium during the flower ceremony for the women 's free skate figure skating final at the @entity42 @entity20 would have been the third woman in history to defend her olympic gold medal after her landslide win at the @entity85 where she beat her closest rival by 23.06 points			1
however , that title eluded her when @entity18 was announced as the gold - medal winner with @entity20 in second and @entity77 @entity76 with bronze			2
the reaction was immediate and vocal , with more than 700,000 people signing the petition within six hours			0
many called for greater transparency in the judging panel , which was overwhelmingly made up of @entity97 nations			1
petition : this change.org petition has been signed almost 1.8 million times since thursday shock : many in the figure skating world expressed surprise that @entity20 did not win gold for her performance upstart : the young @entity8 dethroned the ' @entity107 ' @entity20 , to the chagrin of many one of the judges , whose votes were anonymous , was @entity111 of the @entity112 who was caught on camera trying to fix an event at the @entity116 in @entity117			1
another , @entity16 , is married to the head of the @entity8 figure skating federation , reports @entity121			1
critics pointed to another @entity8 skater in the competition , @entity123 , who fell more than once during her program yet still managed to beat @entity127 @entity126 , who came in seventh			1
' i feel gypped , ' @entity126 said at a news conference thursday			0
' people do n't want to watch a sport where you see people fall down and somehow score above someone who goes clean			0
' historical : @entity137 won @entity77 's first - ever @entity13 figure skating singles medal speaking to @entity140 , @entity126 said the results of the free skate have left her ‘ speechless			1
’ however , the 22 - year - old skater 's comments came as a surprise to @entity18 ’s coach , @entity146 , who told @entity8 reporters from @entity148 friday that @entity126 approached her rival backstage after the free skate and congratulated her , telling @entity18 that her victory was well - deserved			1
@entity146 also came to @entity16 ’s defense , insisting that her judging has always been objective			2
@entity18 herself has brushed off the brewing scandal and the petition			2
the 17 - year - old sounded defiant during a recent interview , stating in @entity8 that her goal is to win ' all the gold possible - and more than once			2
' even @entity160 , who coaches skater @entity123 – @entity18 ’s @entity8 rival - publicly said that the 17 - year - old deserved to be at the top of the podium			1
' in my opinion , it is not right at this time to discuss who is married to whom , ' @entity160 said , referring to @entity170			0
@entity160 went on to say that she had reviewed recordings of @entity18 and @entity20 's free skates , and came to a conclusion that the @entity8 's quality of skating and artistry were superior to @entity20 's performance thursday night			1
the current scoring system rates the technical elements of a skater 's routine , then the execution and presentation using a cumulative system			0
