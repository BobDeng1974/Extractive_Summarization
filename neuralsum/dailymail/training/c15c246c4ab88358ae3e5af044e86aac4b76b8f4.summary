by @entity0 last updated at 5:52 pm on 16th january 2012 under fire : @entity2 chairman @entity2 faces closer scrutiny from anti-trust politicians considering whether the company has a monopoly the @entity8 has expanded its probe into @entity10 to look at @entity10 's @entity11 , in an investigation into whether @entity10 ' cooks ' search results to favour its own products , a source said on friday			1
@entity16 , which was launched in june , is similar to @entity17 and @entity18			1
a new version of @entity10 search - called @entity21 - caused protests last week after it mixed photos and posts from @entity11 into @entity10 searches			1
it means , for instance , that if your search term included the name of your dog , then images of your dog from your social network sites would appear in your search results			1
however , the social networking aspect only applies to users of @entity16 , the company 's own social networking site , leaving the likes of @entity18 and @entity17 out in the cold			1
@entity18 described the move as ' warped '			0
@entity42 earlier on friday reported the expansion of the @entity10 probe , citing two people familiar with the situation			2
a @entity10 spokesman , however , said that the @entity8 had not asked about @entity16 or indicated it was looking into the new social network as of this week			1
' @entity10 is effectively using its popularity as a search engine provider to promote its social network by prioritizing @entity16 data , ' said @entity54 last week			1
' bundling one smaller service on the back of another much bigger one is what sparked @entity60 's trouble with antitrust regulators through the late 1990s and early 2000s when it included internet explorer with @entity63			0
' @entity10 claims the lack of results from companies such as @entity18 is due to their withdrawing from agreements about how @entity10 indexes their results			1
' we are a bit surprised by @entity18 's comments about @entity75 , because they chose not to renew their agreement with us last summer , ' says a company spokesperson			0
' the laws are designed to help consumers benefit from innovation , not to help competitors			0
we believe that our improvements to search will benefit consumers by better surfacing social content , and the great thing about the openness of the @entity88 is that if users do n’t like our service they can easily switch to another site , ' said a spokesperson			0
@entity10 new ' search plus your world ' feature has come under fire from @entity18 's general counsel for prioritising results from @entity10 's @entity11 social network the @entity8 , attorneys general in six states , and the @entity103 are looking into complaints alleging @entity10 has been unfairly exploiting its dominance in internet search to promote its other services while ignoring or downplaying pertinent information about its rivals			1
senators are trying to get an accurate reading of the power the @entity114 company wields over the search industry			0
and by promoting its own social networking site , @entity10 has pushed itself further into controversial territory			2
the new changes are ' exactly the kind of thing that the antitrust people are screaming about , ' said @entity122 , an industry expert who has been following @entity10 since the 1990s			0
' this is very un-google like			0
it 's unfair to other services and it 's unfair to people			0
' the move has been compared by industry commentators @entity60 's 1998 decision to bundle its own internet explorer with @entity63 , defeating @entity131 as the market leader of the day			0
@entity10 has used personal data in its search results to varying degrees since since 2005			1
@entity136 moment : @entity138 decided in 1998 to bundle its own internet explorer with @entity63 , defeating @entity131 as the market leader of the day but the ' next level ' changes , which were officially launched on tuesday , may already have had a sizeable effect on the number of people using @entity16 , which has lagged behind @entity17 and @entity18 since its inception			1
the internet analysis company @entity145 has reported that traffic to @entity10 's social networking site was up by 55 per cent in december , month - to - month			2
it is possible that the surge was simply caused by lots of gift - wrapped tablet computers running @entity10 applications , but @entity10 is clearly set on boosting its social network			2
@entity155 spokesman @entity154 said : ' search is simply better with your world in it , and we ’re just getting started			0
' you can connect with them on @entity16 , strike up meaningful conversations and discover entire communities in a way that simply was n’t possible before '			0
behind the scenes @entity10 argues that its terms of service prevent it from trawling other social networks - such as @entity17 and @entity18 - for information , which means that if the ' big two ' want to be included , they have to volunteer their content to @entity10			1
users can opt out out of the new personal services by changing their settings but the move has been slammed by @entity18 's general counsel for ' warping ' search results			1
@entity18 's @entity177 - an ex-employee of @entity10 - tweeted from his personal account : ' bad day for the @entity88			1
having been there , i can imagine the dissension at @entity10 to search being warped this way			2
' but the company issued a statement declaring the move will make it more difficult to find breaking news and other compelling information shared within the 250 million messages , or tweets , posted on its service each day			0
@entity10 plus your world : the move has been slammed by @entity18 , which claims it will be harder to find breaking news on the web it said : ' we ’re concerned that as a result of @entity10 ’s changes , finding this information will be much harder for everyone			2
we think that ’s bad for people , publishers , news organizations and @entity18 users			0
' in an interview with @entity208 , @entity10 's @entity2 denied that the company 's results were made to prioritise @entity11 over other social services			1
if the new formula works as @entity10 expects , the search results will include pertinent information culled from the requestor 's @entity11 account			1
for instance , a query about a football team might include links and comments made about the team by other people in one of the social circles on the user 's @entity11 account			2
the feature has been automatically turned on for all @entity230 - language searches made by users logged into @entity10			2
turning off the personal results permanently will require changing a setting in @entity10 's personal preferences			0
the personal results can also be excluded on a search - by - search basis by clicking on an icon of the globe on the results page ( the personal results will be denoted by a button featuring a human 's silhouette )			0
as part of tuesday 's expansion , the profile pictures of @entity11 account holders will appear in the drop - down suggestions on @entity10 's search box			1
so when typing in ' @entity251 , ' you may see those named @entity251 in your circle along with those @entity10 believes you 'd find interesting			0
searches on general topics such as ' music ' and ' sports , ' will generate suggestions on people and companies that have @entity11 accounts .			0

new opt - in ' @entity264 ' offers social results mixed in with search
only has results from @entity11 - not @entity17 or @entity18
@entity8 to investigate @entity11 , say sources
wider probe into whether @entity10 searches favour @entity10 products
