@entity15 said he was ‘ shocked ’ by his cousin ’s resignation from @entity10 and subsequent arrest , and insisted his cousin ‘ to date he is innocent ’			1
@entity3 was arrested almost three weeks ago after @entity10 called in the @entity21 to investigate a potential offence linked to child abuse images			1
detectives from the @entity21 searched no 10 and were given access to government offices and it systems , but the operation was kept secret until details were leaked to the @entity30 this week			1
mr @entity33 has said he was ‘ profoundly shocked ’ by the allegations against mr @entity3 , with whom he worked as @entity36 advisers in @entity38 ’s government			1
mr @entity3 has not spoken publicly about the allegations since his arrest			1
he has not been charged			2
his relative mr @entity15 said : ‘ i am shocked			0
i know my cousin and nothing i know of him has anything to do with this			0
to date he is innocent			0
there are no charges against him [ but ] nobody is defending him			0
‘ the fact that he chose to resign is a noble decision and shows that he is innocent			2
‘ men of power can have many enemies			0
it could have been jealousy , it could have been revenge			0
it could have been many things , ’ he told the @entity49			0
mr @entity15 , who lives in @entity56 , added : ‘ my cousin is n’t here			0
perhaps he is in @entity59 , perhaps he is in the @entity60			0
between february 13 and today we might have been in contact but since the scandal erupted i have had no news from him			0
’ as deputy head of the @entity10 policy unit , mr @entity3 was one of the most senior figures in mr @entity33 ’s inner circle			1
mr @entity3 , 62 and unmarried , lives in a £ 500,000 flat in @entity70 , @entity71			2
he was born in @entity72 in 1951 , a year after the marriage of his mother @entity74 and @entity76 - born father @entity75			0
his paternal grandmother was a @entity78 , from a noble @entity59 family that originated in @entity56 and boasts a coat of arms			0
prime minister @entity33 has said he is ' profoundly shocked ' by the arrest of his old friend as a teenager , mr @entity3 boarded at the elite @entity85 in @entity86 , winning a scholarship to @entity88 , @entity89 , where he studied history			1
after graduation he worked as @entity93 's political correspondence secretary in the then @entity10 and also as managing director of the @entity95			2
it is not clear when he shortened his name to plain @entity98 , but he used it while fighting the @entity101 election in 1979 , aged 28 , which he lost despite increasing the @entity36 vote			0
the government has faced mounting questions about why it took almost three weeks for the arrest to be made public , and only after a leak to the @entity30			1
number 10 says it first became aware of allegations against mr @entity3 on february 12 , when it called in the @entity21 and informed the prime minister			2
mr @entity3 later resigned and in the early hours of february 13 was arrested by the police			1
cabinet secretary sir @entity113 has defended @entity10 's decision not to make the arrest public officers then entered @entity10 and were given access to official computer systems			1
@entity120 is also demanding to know how much time elapsed between @entity10 being aware of a potential offence , mr @entity3 resigning and the police being called in			1
it comes amid suggestions that informing mr @entity3 of the alleged offence amounted to a ‘ tip - off ’ of his impending arrest			1
@entity128 , @entity120 ’s shadow cabinet office minister , called on the cabinet secretary sir @entity113 to investigate			0
he said there were legitimate concerns ‘ given that mr @entity3 had a senior role at the heart of @entity133 and was privy to the most sensitive information , and that he has had a very close working relationship with the prime minister over a number of years ’			2
mr @entity128 asked : ‘ when were mr @entity3 's colleagues in no. 10 informed that he had resigned , and why was the fact of his resignation not made public immediately ? ‘ what were officials in no. 10 and in other departments with which he had contact told about the reasons for mr @entity3 's absence from work ? ’ in response sir @entity113 said : ‘ @entity10 became aware of a potential offence relating to child abuse imagery on the evening of 12 february			1
i was immediately informed of the allegation and the prime minister was also briefed			0
‘ officials then contacted the @entity21 to seek advice on how to report suspected criminality			2
our subsequent actions were driven by the overriding importance of not jeopardising either their investigation or the possibility of a prosecution			0
‘ @entity3 resigned on the evening of 12 february			1
his resignation was not made public as we judged it was inappropriate to make an announcement while the @entity21 investigations were continuing			0
‘ a few hours later he was arrested			2
we also arranged for officers to come into @entity10 to have access to all it systems and offices they considered relevant			2
‘ there has been no contact from officials with mr @entity3 since his arrest			1

@entity3 resigned and was arrested nearly three weeks ago
but @entity10 only *confirmed* it after being questioned by the @entity30 on *monday*
it also *emerged* that he was accused of *sexual* *harassment* by a colleague
officials face quiz as to why @entity3 was allowed to resign before his arrest
