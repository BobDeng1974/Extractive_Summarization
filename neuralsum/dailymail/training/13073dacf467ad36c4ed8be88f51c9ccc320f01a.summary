by @entity0 published : 16:03 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 16:03 est , 28 may 2013 rare species perform unique roles in the way the world functions , claims new research , contradicting what was previously thought			1
a study from a team of researchers at the @entity11 in @entity12 has discovered that rare species perform tasks that more common species ca n't			1
using data from three different ecosystems - coral reefs , tropical forests and alpine meadows - the researchers found that these unique functions are essential for maintaining balance within current ecosystems			1
rare species , such as the giant moray eel found in coral reefs in the @entity26 , play a much more vital role in the balance of their ecosystems than was first thought coral reefs are underwater structures made from calcium carbonate released by corals			1
reefs grow best in warm , shallow , clear , sunny and agitated waters			0
often called ' rainforests of the sea ' , coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on @entity41			1
they take up less than 0.1 % of the world 's ocean surface , yet are home to 25 % of all marine species , including fish , mollusks , worms , crustaceans , echinoderms and sponges			0
the annual global economic value of coral reefs was estimated at us $ 375 billion in 2002			2
however , coral reefs are fragile ecosystems because they are very sensitive to water temperature			2
and if these rare species disappear , our ecosystems could fail - or struggle to rebuild in the event of a global disaster			2
lead researcher dr @entity63 said : ' these unique features are irreplaceable , as they could be important for the functioning of ecosystems if there is major environmental change			0
' as rare species and the biodiversity of these regions decline , the unique traits and features these animals bring to the areas are vulnerable to extinction because rare species are likely to disappear first			0
biodiverse environments are known by their large number of rare species			0
these rare species contribute to the diversity of an area but , up until now , their functional importance within these ecosystems has been largely unknown			2
because there are fewer rare species within a region , they were traditionally thought to have little bearing on how other species interact and how the ecosystem functions , compared with more common species			2
if rare species seen in places such as coral reefs and rainforests die out , the carefully balanced ecosystems of those regions could fail or be damaged			1
this is because rare species perform unique functions within these areas , say the researchers the rare pyramidal saxifrage , an alpine plant , is an important resource for pollinators in the mountain regions of @entity106 it was previously assumed that rare species play the same roles within an ecosystem as their common neighbours , yet have less impact because of their low numbers			1
this phenomenon is known as ‘ functional redundancy ’			0
the redundancy suggests that rare species merely serve as an ' insurance ' policy for the ecosystem , in the event of an ecological loss			0
to test this , the researchers analysed the extent to which rarer species in the three different ecosystems performed the same ecological functions as the most common ones			0
they examined biological and bio-geographical information from 846 reef fish , 2,979 alpine plants and 662 tropical trees and found that most of the unique and vulnerable functions , carried out via a combination of traits , were associated with rare species			1
examples of rare species that were found by the researchers to perform vulnerable functions include the giant moray , a predatory fish that hunts at night in the labyrinths of coral reefs and the pyramidal saxifrage , an alpine plant that is an important resource for pollinators			1
another was the @entity145 , a huge tree in the rainforest of @entity148 , which is particularly resilient to fire and drought			0
not only are these species rare , they also have few functional equivalents among the more common species in their respective ecosystems , according to the research published in the journal @entity156			0
the rainforest in @entity148 is a biodiverse environment because of the large number of species that live in relatively close proximity			0
researchers have found that rare species , including the @entity168 tree @entity166 maxima , are fundamental to maintaining balance in biodiverse ecosystems dr @entity63 said : ' our results suggest that the loss of these species could heavily impact upon the functioning of their ecosystems			1
' this calls into question many current conservation strategies			0
' the work emphasises the importance of the conservation of rare species , even in diverse ecosystems			2
dr @entity63 said rare species are more vulnerable and serve irreplaceable functions , the preservation of biodiversity as a whole - not just the most common species , but all those who perform vulnerable functions - appears to be crucial for the resilience of ecosystems			2
he added : ' rare species are not just an ecological insurance - they perform additional ecological functions that could be important during rapid transitions experienced by ecosystems			1
' the vulnerability of these functions , in particular biodiversity loss caused by climate change , highlights the underestimated role of rare species in the functioning and resilience of ecosystems			1
' our results call for new experiments to explicitly test the influence of species rarity and the uniqueness of combinations of traits on ecological processes			0

researchers from the @entity11 in @entity12 analysed the role rare species play within coral reefs , tropical forests and alpine meadows
the findings suggest that rare species play a more important part in maintaining ecosystems than was first thought
and this ' calls into question many current strategies '
