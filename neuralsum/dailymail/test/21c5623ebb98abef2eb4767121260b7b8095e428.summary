the shocking moment cyclists dodged the safety barriers at a level crossing to race through the path of a speeding train has been caught on camera			1
during the @entity9 - sir @entity8 ' last for @entity7 - competitors approached a crossing over a train track			1
but as the barriers came down to signal a train was passing through , the racers can be seen swerving to avoid them in a desperate attempt to gain seconds on their rivals - and putting their lives at risk			2
mere seconds later a @entity46 rushes along the train tracks			0
@entity49 sports commentator @entity48 said the competitors had had a close shave			0
' this could have ended in disaster			0
you could see riders nipping across but that train was n't slowing down ' , he said			0
around 85km into the race , the cyclists desperately try to cross the traintracks before the barriers descend sir @entity8 took part in the race - renowned for its demanding route - for the last time for @entity7 cyclists who did cross the rail - tracks could yet be disqualified from the race , as they are expressly banned from crossing a level crossing when the barriers are down			1
the one - day road race , which runs from @entity72 , 50 miles outside @entity73 , to the northern town of @entity26 , was won by @entity76 cyclist @entity75			0
the race is known for its challenging 254km route , which includes 27 cobbled sections and level crossings			0
it was the last time @entity83 @entity82 winner sir @entity8 would compete for @entity7 , and told their official site before the race it was a great way to finish			1
riding in his final race for @entity7 , the @entity89 and @entity91 time - trial champion failed to win the prestigious @entity93 one - day race ' it 's probably the only race other than the @entity82 where riders plug on to get to the finish			2
' even if i 've been dropped or crashed , i 'll ride on with a broken collarbone just to come into the velodrome as it 's my last race			0
no other race would be like that			0
' during the race his teammate @entity105 - who managed to avoid the level crossing incident - suffered a puncture			2
it was a fitting end for @entity111 , who was among the first riders to join @entity7 for its inaugural season in 2010 @entity114 shared the competition rules on @entity116 - stating that it is ' strictly forbidden ' for cyclists to cross level crossing			1
offending riders should be disqualified from the competition , the rules add ' riders plug on to get to the finish ' , sir @entity8 said before the race - where cyclists risked life and limb to cross a closed level crossing and beat the pack			1
this was his final race with @entity7 fans created a special sign for sir @entity8 , who in 2012 was the first @entity83 cyclist to win the @entity82 showing appreciation : fans hold a sign thanking @entity111 at the @entity26 at the end of the race			1

*ultra-competitive* racers risk life and limb to cross railway 85km into race
train races past seconds after policeman stops more cyclists crossing
last @entity7 road race for @entity82 winner sir @entity8
sir @entity8 - who was n't involved in level crossing problem - finished 18th
