sentencing him to three years ' imprisonment , judge @entity28 described him as a ‘ serial , sexual pervert ' and called for him to be removed from the country as soon as possible			1

the first attack took place on a @entity49 train going from @entity50 into central @entity6 , the court heard			1
prosecutor @entity51 said : ' the defendant got onto the train and sat down beside [ the first victim ] - even though there were plenty of empty double seats on the carriage			1
' the victim noticed mr @entity2 was rubbing his elbow up against her			1
she tried moving away but the defendant kept moving closer to her			2
he would look away whenever she tried to look at him			2
' at one point , after the defendant had got up and sat back down again , the victim felt him touching her stomach and looked down to find his hand under her top			1
' when she challenged him the defendant got up and moved			2
' the second assault , on a 15 - year - old girl , happened on a bus in mid-afternoon a few days later , the court was told			1
the teenager boarded the bus and immediately felt uncomfortable because @entity19 had been staring at her at the bus stop			2
' there were other double seats available yet the defendant chose to sit next to her , ' mr @entity51 said			2
' he was staring at her before moving his arm and touching her right leg with his hand			0
he then tried to get his hand under her top and on top of her leggings			0
' the third attack , which happened on another bus the same day , left the 16 - year - old victim ' paralysed with fear '			0
@entity19 sat next to her , before using his fingers to caress the girl 's stomach and moved his hand down to her shorts			1

@entity19 was arrested on september 17 after police used his oyster card to track him down			0
judge @entity28 said : ‘ i do n’t underestimate the impact this has had on the psychological wellbeing of the victims			0
' speaking about the first incident , the judge said : ' i have no doubt that you knew she knew you were touching her and indeed the thrill for you in part was the fright that you were causing to that woman			0
i have no doubt that that fed into your sexual satisfaction			0
‘ when subsequently interviewed you said that you could n’t remember the incident			0
you attempted to blame @entity11 as causing you to forget			0
as became plain during the course of the interview that was a lie - you did know what you had done			0
’ she said that the second victim , aged just 15 , was ' very uncomfortable ' , adding : ‘ i have no doubt you targeted her too and i have no doubt that part of the sexual thrill of your offending was the helplessness of the woman who was the subject of your sexual assault			0
‘ i say " woman " , but she was in fact a child			0
she got off the bus and burst into tears and rang her mother			0
but that was clearly not sexually satisfying enough for you because within 90 minutes you were assaulting another woman			0
’ in relation to the fourth attack , judge @entity28 said : ' you said you were sorry , and that you did not know what you were doing because you were fasting			1
' it ’s my fervent wish that you will be immediately deported from the @entity167			1
