by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 07:22 est , 28 november 2012 the founder of @entity2 has urged the government to block @entity5 's extradition of a @entity7 student on copyright charges in another attack on the ' dangerous ' treaty between the two countries			1
@entity12 , 45 , has spoken out in support of @entity14 , 24 , who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of charges relating to his website , @entity18 , which linked to other sites that streamed pirated television programmes			1
mr @entity12 , who has met mr @entity14 , today called on home secretary @entity21 to stop the extradition , which was approved by a district judge in january , calling the student ' the human face of the battle between the content industry and the interests of the general public			1
' ' @entity14 is not a @entity5 citizen , he ’s lived in the @entity7 all his life , his site was not hosted there , and most of his users were not from the @entity5 , ' mr @entity12 wrote in the @entity35			1
outspoken : @entity2 founder @entity12 , right , says the government should stop the extradition of student @entity14 , left , claiming he is unfairly caught up in a censorship battle ' the internet as a whole must not tolerate censorship in response to mere allegations of copyright infringement			1
as citizens we must stand up for our rights online			2
' given the thin case against him , it is an outrage that he is being extradited to the @entity5 to face felony charges for something that he is not being prosecuted for here			1
no @entity5 citizen has ever been brought to the @entity7 for alleged criminal activity that took place on @entity5 soil			1
' @entity7 's extradition treaty with the @entity5 has already been branded ‘ unbalanced ’ by mps who have called for it to be urgently reformed			1
the government is under huge pressure to renegotiate the @entity64 and the @entity65 has also launched its @entity66 to @entity7 justice campaign in support of @entity72 ’s sufferer @entity70 , who hacked into @entity5 military computers from the bedroom of his @entity75 flat			1
support : @entity70 , pictured , is also facing extradition to the @entity5 on computer hacking charges mr @entity12 ' plea is yet another call for it to be changed , with @entity14 ’s supporters arguing that as the site did not host material itself he should not face any charges and should therefore not be extradited			1
mr @entity12 , in a petition on the @entity89 website , said @entity90 was ' similar to a search engine '			1
' when i met @entity14 ( along with his mother ) , he struck me as a clean - cut , geeky kid			0
still a university student , he is precisely the kind of person one can imagine launching the next big thing on the internet , ' he said today			0
' @entity102 , with a sharp mind and a quick wit , he reminds me of many great entrepreneurs			0
he tried to follow the law , and i would argue that he very likely succeeded in doing so			0
' mr @entity12 argued that mr @entity14 , from @entity105 in @entity106 but studying in @entity107 , always did his best to play by the rules , saying that on the few occasions he received requests to remove content from copyright holders , he complied			1
' copyright is an important institution , serving a beneficial moral and economic purpose , ' he wrote			0
' but that does not mean that copyright can or should be unlimited			0
' it does not mean that we should abandon time - honoured moral and legal principles to allow endless encroachments on our civil liberties in the interests of the moguls of @entity126			0
' it is the latest move by mr @entity128 into a political arena			2
earlier this year @entity2 , the free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit , blacked out the @entity133 language version of its website in protest at anti-piracy laws being considered by the @entity5 government			1
supporters include the film and music industry , which often sees its products sold illegally			0
they say the legislation is needed to protect intellectual property and jobs			0
track record : in january mr @entity128 shut down @entity2 in a ' blackout ' he said was a protest against @entity5 copyright laws @entity149 , @entity14 ’s mother , said mr @entity128 ’s intervention was a huge boost to their campaign			1
' it is obviously quite significant to have @entity12 ’s support , ” she said			1
' he did n’t do that lightly			0
he spent a lot of time talking to @entity14			0
' it has concentrated efforts to get the message across to the government , because it is in their hands			0
' she said mr @entity14 was due to have an appeal heard at the @entity165 in october or november this year			2
mr @entity14 is one of several high - profile cases of @entity7 being extradited to the @entity5 under a treaty signed in 2003 , which critics say is unfairly biased against @entity7 citizens			1
he told @entity35 that he was coping ' quite well ' with the threat of extradition			2
' it does get in the way , it distracts you ... if you thought about extradition all day you ’d never get any work done			2
it ’d be a horrible mess , ' he said			0
' it ’s quite difficult but i think i ’m managing quite well			0
' i think about it sometimes during the day , but i try to think about other things that are more important			0
i do n’t let their extradition warrant ruin my life			2
' otherwise you ’d fail university , just sit in your room all day moaning			0
they ’d be winning if i let it do that			0
' a @entity194 spokesman said today : ' we have effective , fair and balanced extradition arrangements with the @entity5 and other international partners			1
' people who have committed serious offences such as murder , rape , other sex crimes and fraud , have been successfully extradited to the @entity7 and convicted			2
' it should also be noted that our courts have refused to extradite nine people requested by the @entity5 since 2004 , while @entity5 courts have not refused any of our extradition requests			1
” @entity209 , director of @entity210 , said : ' it is very significant that a giant of the internet has joined the campaign against @entity7 ’s dangerously unfair extradition laws			2
' the world - wide nature of the web leaves people incredibly vulnerable to being dragged across the world to face trial when they never left their bedrooms , let alone their country			2
' we need far more safeguards and judicial discretion if a great deal of injustice and suffering is to be prevented			0

' it is an outrage that he is being extradited to the @entity5 to face felony charges for something that he is not being prosecuted for here , ' he said
mr @entity12 says that home secretary @entity21 should intervene directly in this case and block @entity240 ' extradition
