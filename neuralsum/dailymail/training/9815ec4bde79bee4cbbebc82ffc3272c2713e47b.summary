@entity1 's trip to @entity2 might not be one to grab the headlines but , personally speaking , it certainly brings back memories			1
this is only the second time @entity1 have been to @entity6 but the first occasion we were there , on june 6 , 2007 for a @entity12 qualifier , i realised that i could no longer carry on representing my country			1
that was the match that pushed me into international retirement			0
a fortnight earlier , i had just played in my second @entity18 final in three years			0
that game against @entity20 came at the end of a season when my form had been consistently good , so i felt i had solid claims to be considered for a starting role for @entity1			2
@entity26 ( left ) was left on the bench as @entity1 beat @entity2 3 - 0 in a @entity12 qualifier in june , 2007 @entity29 ( centre ) was chosen to partner @entity31 ( right ) in the absence of the injured @entity33 midfielder @entity34 ( second from left ) is congratulated after scoring against @entity2 at the @entity35 on the friday before we headed out to @entity2 , @entity36 hosted its first @entity1 senior game since its redevelopment , against @entity40			1
@entity33 was injured and i thought i 'd take his place alongside @entity31 but i played right back and was n't overly thrilled with my performance			1
i had hoped it was just an experiment but @entity29 retained his place next to @entity31 for the game in the @entity35 , which @entity1 comfortably won 3 - 0			1
i stayed on the bench and when @entity47 made that decision , i knew the final nail had been put in the coffin for me , internationally			0
it was in @entity6 that i knew the time had come to concentrate solely on @entity53			2
@entity26 ( right ) had started at right back for @entity1 in a friendly with @entity40 at @entity36 five days earlier @entity40 forward @entity55 ( right ) tries to hold off a challenge from @entity26 during the 1 - 1 draw this week i 'm looking forward to … immersing myself in @entity61 's book i 've just got my copy of @entity64 and although i am only a couple of chapters into it , it has not disappointed			1
people have their own opinions of @entity61 and some would be fearful of him , given how outspoken he can be			2
i have always judged people how i find them and i can honestly say that i have never found a fault in him			0
during @entity73 , i worked with him on @entity75 as a pundit			0
as you can imagine , he was never afraid to say what he thought but , away from the cameras , he was always good company and he enjoys talking about football			0
this latest book has generated a lot of headlines but i do n't think it should be forgotten what a magnificent player @entity61 was			2
former @entity87 midfielder @entity61 poses at the launch of his new book at the @entity90 @entity26 ( second from right ) and @entity61 ( right ) worked together as @entity75 pundits during @entity73 i would have loved to have been on the same team as him and it must have been a joy for centre backs to have him standing in front , for the cover he would provide			1
do not underestimate , however , the skill he had			0
i noticed @entity101 said in a recent interview that he regarded @entity61 as the best passer of the ball he played with and i could see no reason to argue with that claim as his distribution was magnificent			0
he had a fabulous career and i know i ’m going to enjoy reading about it			0
@entity61 lifts the lid on his career at @entity87 in his latest autobiography @entity64			1

@entity1 last faced @entity2 in a @entity12 qualifier in june , 2007
