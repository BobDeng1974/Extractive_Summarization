police were last night urged to patrol in pairs for their own safety amid rising fears of a terrorist plot to murder an officer on @entity7 streets			1
the advice was issued by the nation 's counter-terrorism chief as it was revealed that hundreds of extra firearms officers will be deployed across @entity12			1
fears of an attack in @entity7 were raised after the atrocities in @entity16 that left 17 dead , among them three police officers			1
assistant commissioner @entity36 , the national police lead for counter-terrorism , has now advised force chiefs in @entity40 and @entity41 to ' review the safety and security of staff ' urgently – and to abandon lone patrols where necessary			1
in response , the country 's biggest force , the @entity48 , has adopted dual patrols as policy – something previously considered a luxury			1
with resources stretched , home secretary @entity54 had previously encouraged forces to let officers take to the streets alone			2
the reversal will be welcomed by @entity12 's frontline officers who have felt increasingly in danger , amid warnings from @entity63 that uniformed police or soldiers would be targets for terror attacks			1
some officers have spoken of concern that they have been subject to ' hostile reconnaissance ' in the vicinity of police stations when travelling to or from work			1
it led to calls for them to be allowed to carry protective equipment such as @entity78 spray and batons while off - duty			0
@entity36 , the national police lead for counter-terrorism , has now advised force chiefs in @entity40 and @entity41 to ' review the safety and security of staff ' urgently – and to abandon lone patrols where necessary mr @entity36 , who briefed chief constables at a meeting last thursday , has advised officers not to go to and from work in ' half - blue ' – wearing part of their uniform often hidden under a jacket – instead asking them to adopt purely civilian clothes while travelling			1
in october , a court heard that four men charged with a terror plot had allegedly sworn allegiance to @entity98 and planned to murder police or soldiers in a drive - by shooting on the streets of @entity12			2
it was claimed they carried out ' reconnaissance ' of @entity108 's @entity107 police station in @entity12 and a barracks in nearby @entity110			1
yesterday , as @entity112 remained on high alert , it was revealed that hundreds of extra firearms officers were being deployed across @entity12 , which already has 2,700 heavily - equipped officers authorised to carry guns			0
@entity117 is also likely to double the number of its officers carrying @entity121 from 2,500 to 5,000			0
officers have been given a four - page document with advice on safety measures			2
it urges caution , for instance , when using social media accounts			0
meanwhile , @entity7 's border forces have stepped up security checks to prevent automatic weapons , such as those used in @entity134 , from entering the country			1
security sources say the @entity16 cities of @entity138 and @entity139 have become a ' hotbed ' for high - powered assault rifles in recent years			2
' @entity16 in particular has seen a huge expansion in the number of weapons on the streets , and there is no guarantee they wo n't end up here , ' said a source			2
the @entity152 killers possessed an array of weaponry almost unthinkable on the streets of @entity7			0
it included a @entity159 - made @entity158 sub-machine gun , several @entity161 assault rifles , @entity163 pistols , an @entity165 grenade launcher and hand grenades			0
border checks at the @entity168 have so far kept @entity7 relatively free of such hardware , but security chiefs admit that there are now so many in @entity112 that they are more likely to be smuggled into the country			0
officials estimate there could be as many as 10 million weapons in illegal circulation across the @entity178 and say an assault rifle can be bought for under £ 1,000 on the black market and handguns for half that amount			0
many are understood to come from @entity112 and the former yugoslav republics as well as from the @entity184 and @entity185			0
