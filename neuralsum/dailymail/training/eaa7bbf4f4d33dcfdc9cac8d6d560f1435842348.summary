by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 05:44 est , 1 october 2013 reforms : @entity3 prime minister @entity2 during his speech in @entity5 where he announced a relaxation of a ban on headscarves @entity3 has taken the first step towards ending the country 's long - standing ban on headscarves for women sitting in @entity15 and working in the civil service			1
the reform of the rule on @entity20 dress , which dates back to the early days of the @entity3 , is potentially incendiary , pitching the government against the secular elite			1
it follows a summer of persistent , sometimes violent demonstrations in @entity3 's biggest towns and cities , involving protesters who have accused the country 's leaders of following an @entity31 agenda			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity2 unveiled the proposal on headscarves yesterday as part of a big package of long - delayed liberalising reforms			1
it will lift a ban preventing women in public offices from wearing @entity20 dress , except in those jobs that require uniforms such as the military and security services , and the courts			0
in the past the ban has kept many women from joining the public work force , contributing to a relatively low female employment rate which has been regarded as one of the @entity3 's economic weaknesses			0
but the issue has exacerbated tension between religious and secular elites , one of the major fault lines in @entity3 public life			2
@entity2 has already eased the ban on head scarves at universities and religious schools , drawing fierce criticism from secularists who see the government pushing an @entity20 agenda			1
tear gas enveloped @entity3 's streets in june and july in a fierce crackdown on mass demonstrations against mr @entity2 's @entity70 , which has been accused of creeping authoritarianism			0
proposals : the reform , announced in a major policy speech , will lift a ban on women in public offices wearing @entity20 dress , except in jobs that require uniforms such as the military and security services and the courts police used tear gas and rubber bullets at a string of protests which began in opposition to a planned @entity90 town centre development and grew amid widespread anger at economic reforms			1
many were also angry at mr @entity2 's moves to curtail the power of the military which , like its counterpart in @entity97 , has long been the guardian of the country 's secular values , toppling four governments in four decades			2
four people were killed and 7,500 wounded in last summer 's police crackdown , according to the @entity104			0
potentially incendiary : a protestor throws a tear gas canister back at riot police during mass demonstrations in @entity5 against the perceived increasing authoritarianism of mr @entity2 's @entity70 over the summer police fire tear gas at demonstrators during street fighting near @entity90 's @entity114 in june : protests began in opposition to a planned town centre development and grew amid widespread anger at economic reforms an anti-government protester in @entity90 in june : many were also angry at moves to curtail the power of the military which , like its counterpart in @entity97 , has long been the guardian of the country 's secular values a woman holds a large squirt gun to parody water cannons used by police : four people were killed and 7,500 wounded in last summer 's police crackdown , according to the @entity104 in a wide - ranging , major policy speech yesterday mr @entity2 also announced reforms designed to salvage a peace process aimed at ending a conflict with @entity139 insurgents			1
@entity3 's @entity139 , who make up around a fifth of the country 's 76million population , have for many years been denied political rights , leading to one of @entity145 's longest - running , and most under - reported ethnic conflicts			1
changes to the electoral system , a broadening of language rights and permission for villages to reinstate their original @entity139 names were all proposed in an effort to extend a hand to separatists			1
@entity3 's human rights record has been badly tarnished by its handling of the insurgency by the @entity160 ( @entity160 ) , which has crippled the economy in the mainly @entity139 south - east of the country			1
more than 40,000 people have been killed in fighting since 1984			1
other reforms include allowing election campaigns to be conducted in languages other than @entity3 and decriminalising the use of @entity139 letters not found in the @entity3 alphabet			1
all primary school students in state schools will now also no longer have to recite a deeply nationalistic vow at the start of each week , which begins with the words : ' i am a @entity179 '			0
people watch mr @entity2 's speech at a coffee shop in @entity90 yesterday : @entity3 's prime minister also announced reforms designed to salvage a peace process to end a 30 - year conflict with @entity139 insurgents mr @entity2 has invested much political capital in the peace initiative , which has drawn strong public support			1
but he is increasingly attracting fierce nationalist criticism over the perceived concessions to militants who are officially labelled terrorists			0
in his speech , mr @entity2 said parliament would debate whether to reduce the threshold for a political party to enter parliament to 5 per cent of the national vote , or even eliminate the barrier completely			0
the current 10 per cent threshold , among the highest in the world , has kept @entity205 parties out of parliament and has been one of the main grievances of the @entity139			2
mr @entity2 said his ' democratisation package ' would also allow for education in languages other than @entity3 at non-state schools , another long - held demand by @entity139 politicians			1
he told a news conference in @entity5 : ' today our country , our nation , is experiencing an historic moment			2
it is passing through a very important stage			0
' we are taking important steps to make @entity3 even greater			0
' he added : ' our people 's greatest wish is to strengthen our domestic peace , further our social cohesion and solidarity , and fortify our tranquillity			0
' insurgency : a child holds the flag of the outlawed @entity160 during a protest in @entity234 yesterday			2
@entity139 make up around a fifth of the @entity3 's 76million population but have few political rights @entity139 chant slogans and flash victory signs : changes to the electoral system , a broadening of language rights and permission for villages to reinstate their original @entity139 names were all proposed in @entity2 's speech oppression : @entity3 's human rights record has been badly tarnished by its handling of the @entity139 insurgency , which has killed 40,000 since 1984 and crippled the economy in the south - east of the country while mr @entity2 reiterated that the proposed reforms are not directly linked with efforts to end the 29 - year conflict with the outlawed @entity160 , the changes are largely viewed as an effort to advance the flagging peace process			1
but the @entity260 ( @entity261 ) said the proposals were not enough to satisfy @entity139 militants , who this month halted their withdrawal from @entity3 territory			2
@entity261 co-chairman @entity266 said : ' the democratisation package does not meet our expectations			0
the package does not have the capacity to overcome blockages in the peace process			0
' ms @entity266 criticised mr @entity2 's proposed reform on mother tongue instruction in schools as this would only apply to private fee - paying institutions			2
and she reiterated the @entity261 's demand to eliminate the vote threshold entirely , saying any lowering of the barrier would not justly represent the votes			0
jailed @entity160 leader @entity283 and @entity3 officials began peace talks almost a year ago , and in march rebels called a halt to hostilities			0
the ceasefire has largely held but earlier this month the @entity160 warned that hostilities could resume without concrete action by the government			0
the government accuses the militants of failing to live up to their side of a bargain , and mr @entity2 has previously said only 20 per cent of the @entity160 fighters had withdrawn from @entity3 .			0

potentially incendiary proposal pitches government against secular elite
it follows summer of protest against politicians ' perceived @entity31 agenda
@entity307 announced plan in wide - ranging policy speech in @entity5
also proposed were reforms aimed at stopping @entity139 insurgency
that three - decade conflict has led to 40,000 deaths since 1984
