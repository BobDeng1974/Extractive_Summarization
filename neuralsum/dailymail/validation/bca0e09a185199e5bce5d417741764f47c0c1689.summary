it is a job that would move the most mild - mannered soul to explode in a @entity3 burst of coarse cussing a dozen times a day			1
if you ca n’t deal with a steady stream of frustrations , do n’t ever move into coaching - it ’ll break your heart * and * send you halfway round the twist			1
take @entity14 ’s experiences yesterday			1
he ’s picked his xv to take on @entity16 at @entity17 , the toughest test of this exasperating @entity20 campaign			1
@entity14 has had a difficult time of things , with @entity23 picking up a late injury before saturday 's game coach @entity14 said the 24 - year - old centre @entity23 had played a key role in the @entity28 xv he ’s watching the boys run through their paces in the final training session before catching a lunchtime flight to @entity33 , when @entity23 – without another player within touching distance – changes direction and crumples to the turf			1
suddenly one of his key men , a wrecking ball in attack and a bear in defence , is out not just of tomorrow ’s @entity45 clash , but the rest of this season – possibly including the @entity48			1
@entity49 has to move from barking orders to comforting a young man facing up to a potential six months in rehab			1
if he did n’t believe in voodoo , hoodoos , juju and jinxes before he took the @entity28 gig … ‘ we ’re a team who do n’t get things easy , ’ said @entity14 , looking more than a little shaken by the turn of events			1
‘ it ’s another example of it			1
‘ it ’s the kind of thing that can happen any time , of course			1
i will give you an example			2
thursday training when i was in charge at @entity73 , we had finished , i ’d blown my whistle			2
@entity75 and @entity76 were running , laughing , @entity75 tackles @entity76 and breaks his leg			2
these are just the things that happen , unfortunately			2
’ @entity14 ’s declaration that the squad may be brought closer together by the sudden loss of @entity23 - his team - mates moved to win one for the @entity83 , so to speak - is understandable			1
it does no - one any good to start tearing cloth and weeping over the absence of one player , however influential			2
@entity88 has ability and form enough to deputise , definitely , while recalls for @entity90 at lock and @entity92 at @entity93 should help @entity28 in their bid to do something pretty ambitious – out - @entity16 the @entity98 big men			1
@entity23 , here showing his disappointment after @entity28 's loss to @entity101 , awaits results of scans on his knee how @entity16 and @entity28 will line up for saturday 's @entity45 clash ‘ @entity16 are a big physical team and they play a very percentage - orientated game , based on occupation , field position and a strong pack , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ they also have very good finishers in their team , strong runners , line breakers			2
so they are a team based around their power , their line - out and their scrum			2
‘ we ’ve been looking at trying to compete – and put them under pressure in what they consider to be their strong points			2
hopefully if we can contest there and keep the game as tight as possible for as long as possible , you never know			1
‘ @entity127 got on top of them around the rucks and i think they will be more aggressive in that area to get the go - forward they did n’t get against @entity127			2
@entity127 shut down their passing game and got them into an arm wrestle			1
‘ defensively , @entity127 played very well against them and did n’t let them put in several passes			2
they will have worked on how to counter those tactics			2
@entity141 and foremost , we look at our contact zone and our set piece			0
we have to be able to adapt			0
‘ we also need to be better in the air			0
we have known that since the start of the @entity20			0
we know that they use the ball in the air a fair bit			0
‘ @entity90 is there for his experience			0
he knows their players very well and i think he may be able to unsettle them with his individual knowledge			0
he is there to give us that solid base at scrum and lineout			0
’ @entity159 wins just his fifth cap on the right wing , given the chance partly due to a @entity164 injury but also because @entity14 likes ‘ his energy , enthusiasm , his kick - chase , ’ adding : ‘ he is a young player who is strong , creates line breaks and is a finisher as well			1
it was tight , but we think his energy , especially in the aerial game , will be important			1
’ @entity23 faces a race against time to be fit for the @entity48 after injuring his knee at training @entity14 spoke in the aftermath of the home defeat to @entity179 about the brutal honesty required in order to fix the problems so obviously exposed , although he plays down any notion that he ’s been tearing his players limb from metaphorical limb this week			1
instead , he says that suffering that late loss might even be of long - term benefit to his squad , pointing out : ‘ we were two minutes away from lauding the character of a young team for getting out of a tough situation with a scrum penalty			1
‘ in a lot of ways it has been a bit of a blessing because we can really look in depth at things that may have been ignored or smoothed over			0
we have had a good look at ourselves			0
the coaches , the players , everybody			0
’ addressing those promises of a bloody inquest into the worst performance of the campaign , he added : ‘ those things are always a little exaggerated			0
we were just very clear on what we want to see and what we expect			0
we need to learn from certain things			0
that was the theme behind this week ’s training			0
‘ this weekend , there is the @entity45 and the result two weeks ago			0
that means there has been more of an edge to training			0
it is always nice to have an objective			0
‘ we are two days away from playing for something that we could bring home			0
it has been a few years since @entity28 won at @entity17			1
no one is giving us much of a chance			0
but we will be measuring our improvements from two weeks ago and those things will help us develop our game and become more competitive			1
’ hardly a rousing @entity227 aimed at whipping his men into a frenzy			0
but , then , maybe he ’s saving all his fired - up frustrations for the pre-match address			0
as the @entity20 rolls on to the penultimate weekend of the campaign , @entity14 may have enough fuel left to strip the paint from the walls of @entity17 .			1

@entity14 *refuses* to feel sorry for himself after injury problems
@entity28 coach accepts freak injuries can be part of the game
but @entity23 will be huge loss for @entity28 against @entity16
