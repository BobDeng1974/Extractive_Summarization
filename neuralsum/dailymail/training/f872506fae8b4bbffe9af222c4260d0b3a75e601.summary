by @entity0 published : 20:46 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 20:50 est , 13 february 2013 angry : @entity2 's scathing criticism of the @entity4 's handling of the @entity6 scandal is to be removed from transcripts in a @entity4 inquiry scathing criticism by @entity2 about how the @entity4 dealt with the @entity11 crisis is to be removed from transcripts of evidence given to the corporation ’s inquiry into the affair			1
the @entity20 host ’s full , potentially explosive , opinions on his bosses ’ handling of the scandal have been ‘ redacted ’ for legal reasons amid fears they were potentially defamatory			2
in addition , evidence provided by the global news director @entity28 - responsible for the @entity29 - has also been removed for similar reasons			1
both men were said to have been very critical of how senior @entity34 bosses handled the investigation into @entity6 after his death in october 2011			0
their evidence is contained within thousands of witness statements , e-mails and text messages gathered by former head of @entity43 @entity42 last year			2
he published an interim review last december into why @entity20 dropped its probe into @entity6 ’s abuse of young girls in december 2011 , two months after his death and shortly before the corporation broadcast @entity52 specials about the @entity53 the devastating allegations for some of his victims ended up being screened by @entity58 last october and triggered an avalanche of claims from women that they , too , had been a victim of @entity11			0
next week mr @entity42 is due to publish more of the evidence in his final report			2
staff at the @entity4 have been given access to lawyers at the corporation ’s expense before final publication to check the material			1
this is because many of the witnesses did not realise that their evidence would end up being published			2
despite the decision to redact , some of mr @entity2 ’s embarrassing criticisms of the handling of the @entity6 case are already in the public domain			1
after @entity20 ’s then editor @entity81 wrote a blog last october explaining the @entity4 ’s handling of the story , @entity2 emailed him to say that the blog ‘ does n’t answer all of the accusations laid against us ’			1
he continued : ’ i have to say , i think we make a problem for ourselves by running away from this story			0
' removed : evidence provided by the global news director @entity28 ( left ) - responsible for the @entity29 - has also been removed after thousands of emails , witness statements and text messages were gathered by former head of @entity43 news @entity42 , right , last year he added ‘ it raises questions about the way in which the claims of child abuse victims are treated ’ and ‘ it raises serious questions about journalistic ethics – different burdens of proof for the living and the dead – which are slap - bang in our terrain			1
‘ the redaction has emerged as it was also disclosed that the @entity115 ’s most high - profile woman executive has accepted a new post just days before the release of the updated review into the @entity4 ’s handling of the @entity121 scandal			1
@entity122 , who is director of news , has accepted a new post as the corporation ’s radio chief			1
confirmation of her new role as director of audio and music follows months of speculation about her future and her ability to keep her job			2
scathing : both @entity2 and @entity135 are said to have been highly critical of the @entity4 's handling of an investigation into allegations against sir @entity6 ( pictured ) it was initially thought that if she left the @entity4 she would demand a huge compensation payment and she had engaged lawyers to help her answer mr @entity42 ’s questions			1
miss @entity122 has already been heavily criticised for failing to tackle the ‘ meltdown ’ that ensued in parts of the news department over the abandoned news story into @entity6 ’s abuse			0
the first @entity42 report was published in december			0
but the second - out next week - is expected to include not just testimonies but also emails and text messages			0
@entity4 insiders admit that some of the material is likely to be deeply embarrassing to a number of the corporation ’s senior executives			2
miss @entity122 is understood to have been told last week that incoming director general @entity159 would like her to make the switch to radio			0
at the height of the @entity11 crisis the @entity4 news chief temporarily ‘ stepped aside ’ from her £ 340,000 a year role , and it was later revealed she had at one point offered to resign			1
in his interim report in december , mr @entity42 said @entity169 ‘ should have taken greater responsibility ’			0
he said he was ‘ surprised ’ she did not take ‘ a more proactive role ’ particularly given that a ‘ significant part of the division she headed ’ was in ‘ virtual meltdown ’			0
an insider said last night of miss @entity122 ’s move : ‘ she has accepted			0
it is a done deal			0

lawyers fear that @entity2 's comments could be defamatory
his scathing *attack* will not be included in an inquiry 's evidence transcripts
evidence from @entity4 global news director @entity28 also to be removed
