inducing pregnant women once they reach 37 weeks can lower the chance of the baby dying or developing a serious health condition , a study has suggested			1
the research , which analysed 770,926 births over a 13 - year period , found the risk of neo-natal death went down from 1.9 to one per 1,000 births from 2000 to 2012			2
there was a drop in the rate of cerebral palsy by 26 per cent between 2002 and 2010 , according to the study of @entity17 babies			1
a quarter of women in @entity17 pregnant beyond 37 weeks have labour induced			1
risk factors such as smoking , increased maternal age and first - time motherhood were all taken into account			0

' another similar study we conducted recently also demonstrated a halving of stillbirths following the implementation of proactive labour induction practice			1
