by @entity0 and @entity1 constant danger : a @entity4 soldier on patrol in the village of @entity7 in @entity8			2
many soldiers serving there were deeply affected			2
( @entity12 image ) in a bleak corner of @entity8 , only twisted , rusting barbed wire , rubble and broken blocks of concrete remain of what were once the @entity4 checkpoints of @entity20 and @entity21			2
yet two years ago they were considered vital to @entity4 operations and security in the region – a buffer against the @entity27 , and during the summer of 2011 , home to the @entity29 of @entity30			1
they provided basic protection in a @entity27 stronghold area known as ‘ @entity35 ’ and through the long hot months of the 2011 ‘ fighting season ’ , clashes were so intense it was compared to the @entity38 wars			1
at its worst , it was a daily lottery for survival			2
at one point during the six - month ‘ tour to hell ’ , the body parts of @entity4 troops blown up by improvised explosive devices were hung in trees as trophies by @entity27 fighters to taunt the @entity29 as they patrolled			1
some @entity29 have said they were also so concerned about running out of ammunition that they collected @entity27 weapons and ammunition			1
indeed in the words of @entity55 – one of the three man tried for the @entity59 ’s murder : ‘ it is a s * * * place out there , it ’s not nice			1
it ’s just a dirty , s * * * * * war			2
’ @entity61 told the court martial that around 20 friends had been killed or maimed during the six - month tour , including a popular young officer and a @entity61 who had previously won a @entity66 for courage under fire			1
he was blown up while searching a mud - walled compound			2
@entity70 , a hardened veteran of previous @entity59 tours as well as @entity73 , said other comrades had suffered ‘ life changing ’ injuries in the blast and described the effect the deaths had on the commandos			2
he said they were not always able to recover the body parts of dead or maimed comrades			1
‘ it had quite a harsh affect			0
it ’s not a nice thing for the lads			0
' close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see			1
’ @entity95 said he had been under attack ‘ every single day ’ and there had been ten casualties in one 24 - hour period			0
‘ my friend ’s legs had been put in a tree , i picked up my mate ’s brains			0
i have no good memories of that tour			1
my way of coping with that was to put it away in a box at the back of my head			0
’ uncertainty haunted daily patrols along routes pitted with booby traps and expertly buried bombs that could be triggered by a footfall			0
ambushes were an all - too - frequent danger			0
locals who waved their greeting at one point would become an enemy to be feared the next – it was a common @entity27 tactic for an attacker in a field to take a shot at patrols and then hide his weapon , picking up a farm tool instead			1
‘ smiled in the back , ’ was how one tour veteran termed it			1
some of the insurgents were called ‘ ten dollar @entity27 ’			1
@entity70 explained : ‘ you find that fighting - age males would take part in the fighting season when the poppy season comes to an end and they are quite prepared to take ten dollars to fight			0
’ isolated : a @entity4 patrol base in the area			0
the key concerns of the @entity29 who testified at the trial yesterday were said to be their limited numbers , their lack of air support and a feeling of isolation			1
( @entity12 image ) a tipping point came in august 2011 , when a popular @entity61 , @entity155 , was badly wounded in an attack in which the @entity27 tried to overrun a commando base			1
@entity29 on patrol were horribly outnumbered			1
after a fierce battle they managed to get back to @entity20 but the emboldened and reinforced @entity27 attacked again and again			1
@entity160 , 23 , was hit by a grenade and seriously wounded			0
the patrol commander called in air support from @entity165 helicopter gunships and the enemy dispersed			0
a chinook helicopter flew @entity160 to @entity168 , but he died			0
colleagues are said to have been furious they had been left so close to being overrun			0
patrol : @entity61 told the court martial that many friends were killed or maimed during the six - month tour , including a popular young officer and a @entity61 who had won a @entity66 for courage			1
( @entity12 image ) dangerous work : uncertainty haunted daily patrols along routes pitted with booby traps and expertly buried bombs that could be triggered by a footfall			0
on other occasions , ambush was a frequent danger			0
( @entity12 image ) in the following weeks there were more attacks			0
the key concerns of the @entity29 were said to be their limited numbers , their lack of air support and overwhelmingly a feeling of isolation			1
@entity61 said when he left for @entity59 he was ‘ keen for action ’ but his attitude altered as the tour progressed			2
‘ it soon became apparent this was not a game , ’ he said			0
‘ i was drained , very stressed and constantly in fear , really			0
’ @entity70 said humour like that captured on the video clips by fellow @entity29 – including swearing at the expense of @entity59 nationals – could be seen as ‘ inappropriate ’ to those back in @entity4			1
‘ but when you are facing on a daily basis people trying to kill you , you inject humour as a coping mechanism as otherwise i would say things would be very dark			0
’ it was against this backdrop of exhaustion , fear and loathing that the murder took place , with the contempt felt by some summed up by @entity70 as he shot the fighter and said : ‘ shuffle off this mortal coil , you c * * *			2
it ’s nothing you would n’t do to us			0
