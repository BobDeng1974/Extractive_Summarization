by @entity0 foxes and hounds are supposed to be sworn enemies , divided by years of hunting history			0
but nobody told these two creatures , who have been getting on like a house on fire since they started living under the same roof			0
like a real - life version of the animals in @entity16 cartoon @entity12 , they became best of friends after both being adopted by a family in @entity20			1
a touch of rivalry might have been expected between the young fox and the family 's pet dog , @entity24 , but the pair have become the best of friends			1
mr @entity27 said : ' it really was love at first sight with them both			2
@entity24 is so gentle with him and they play for hours and hours			1
they are exhausting to watch			0
' both the animals were adopted by the family after being found seemingly abandoned , and , amazingly , both are missing their tails			1
mr @entity27 added : ' i think they might be kindred spirits - even without tails to wag you can tell they are happiest when they are together			0
' it ’s excellent news as @entity23 will never be able to go into the wild now			2
we plan to give him a home here at the farm with our other foxes			0
playmates : the unlikely friends spend hours together playing and scrapping in mr @entity27 's garden catch me if you can : @entity24 chases little @entity23 during one of the creatures ' games of chase ' the more time he spends with @entity24 and with us at home the easier it will be for him to fit in			1
' the fox cub 's lack of tail led staff at @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity20 , to give him his name , ' @entity89 '			0
commenting on hiow he was found , mr @entity27 added : ' he was in an awful state when they found him and it was touch and go for a long time			2
' a fox this young can go downhill very quickly , so he needed round the clock care			0
it ’s a bit like having a new born with night time feeds and constant attention			0
' the pair are now popular with visitors to the @entity102 an @entity104 resort , which runs wildlife activities for tourists			2
the story almost perfectly mirrors that of 1981 film @entity12 , in which a young fox is adopted by a family and befriends a neighbour 's dog			1
ouch : @entity23 - who like @entity24 was found missing his tail - nips at the much bigger dog as they play saved : @entity23 was found sitting in a puddle by a tourist and taken to a local vets , where he was looked after			1

@entity23 was found apparently abandoned in a puddle this year
he was adopted by a family , who have a pet dog named @entity24
the pair have become great friends and now love playing together
video *shows* them chasing each other and play fighting in family garden
