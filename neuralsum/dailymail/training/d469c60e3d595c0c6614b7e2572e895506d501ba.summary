by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 15:49 est , 7 march 2013 a puppy was doused with gasoline , set alight and left for dead in @entity3 - with shocking photographs of the dog revealing the pain inflicted on him by the unknown heartless thugs			1
the @entity9 , named @entity10 by rescuers and thought to be one to two years old , was discovered with second and third degree burns over half of his body			1
large sections of fur and skin on @entity10 's face and body were completely burned off with parts of both ears , an eye and one of his legs irreparably scolded			1
warning : @entity27 tortured : pier , a young @entity9 suffered second and third - degree burns over 45 % of his body including his face , pictured , after being covered in gasoline and set alight left for dead : the puppy was found after wandering the streets of @entity3 for a week with his horrendous injuries , pictured			1
he was unable to bark because of the extent of his injuries struggling to survive : vets were shocked that @entity10 was able to survive his injuries			2
he was unable to bark or make a noise due to the severity of his condition but was luckily discovered by an animal control officer near @entity47 in @entity3 and rushed to the @entity49 rescue shelter			1
co-director of @entity49 , @entity51 , said : ' this is probably one of the most difficult rescues we have done , emotionally and financially			1
' we 've seen a lot of bad stuff ; this is hands - down the worst			2
' ' if you ever met the dog , he 's so friendly , so nice , all he wants to do is come up and nuzzle you			2
i ca n't imagine why anyone would want to do something to a dog like that , ' she added to @entity69 @entity3			0
pier was discovered on february 20 - which vets believe was around a week after the attack			1
@entity75 patches of burnt fur and pink patches of exposed skin covered the black @entity9 's body and face including his heavily injured nose and back leg			1
shelter volunteers were unsure he 'd survive but immediately took him to the @entity87 where he is still being treated			1
' he 'd been out about five to seven days with open wounds and burns , ' @entity88 of @entity49 told the broadcaster			1
long recovery : the puppy is still in animal hospital			1
he has to be put under general anesthetic to have his bandages changes because the wounds are still so raw baby steps : pier is now able to move slowly and is regaining his appetite			2
vets hope his voice will return later this month getting better : pier is beginning to return to a normal puppy life , even playing with a tennis ball fundraising drive : @entity49 has been raising money to pay for @entity10 's treatment			1
thousands of supporters from across the globe have pledged their support ' @entity87 told us they thought it was a miracle that he did n't have any infections even though he 'd been out on the street for a week in that condition			2
' volunteers at the center were heartbroken by @entity10 's case and decided to launch a campaign to raise funds for his treatment			2
since posting the pictures on @entity127 they have been astounded by the response - with thousands of people from across the world writing to express their horror and offer their support for the pup			0
donations have flooded in and a t - shirt has even been designed to help raise much - needed funds for pier and other abuse cases			2
one donor @entity138 said : ' a piece of my soul died when i saw what this sweet soul has had to endure			0
thank you to all those that rescued him and got him to where he needs to be			0
' @entity149 added : ' i hope the sociopaths responsible for this are caught and dealt with to the fullest extent of the law which probably is n't enough '			0
@entity154 said : ' i am enraged at the silence of the people - that know about who did this			0
' @entity3 police agree the attack on @entity10 is a horrendous case of animal cruelty but say they have little hope of catching the culprits unless someone with information comes forward			0
looking up : when @entity10 is fully recovered he will go to a foster family in @entity3 an officer told @entity171 : ' we do n't have an active investigation			0
it is very hard to track down any information because he was found as a stray			0
' in the meantime , @entity10 is making huge strides forward in his recovery at a safe distance from his abusers			1
initially vets thought one of his legs was so badly burned it would need to be amputated along with damaged parts of his ears but they have been able to save it			0
he also has sight in both eyes despite one being burned and ulcerated in the attack			0
and bandaged pictures of the recovering pooch have however brought some relief to his rescuers and supporters			0
two weeks on he is now able to eat and move - and has even shown some interest in playing with a tennis ball			0
vets say he is expected to find his bark again later this month			0
although he will never fully recover - his burns are so bad he will have to have his back permanently covered - they hope he will soon begin a new happier life with a foster family			1
yesterday he was put under anesthetic to change all his bandages and have a tooth also broken in the attack			0
' he is one strong boy and looks like he is going to keep fighting on , ' a volunteer at the shelter said .			2

the small puppy was covered in gasoline by his abusers before being set alight
he received serious burns to 45 % of his body and was left without treatment for a week
thankfully he was saved by @entity49 rescue shelter which are now supporting his recovery
named pier he is doing well and even *remembering* how to play
