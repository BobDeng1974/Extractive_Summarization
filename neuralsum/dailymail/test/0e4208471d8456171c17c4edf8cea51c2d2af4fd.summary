' you 're getting the hang of this commentary lark , ' cooed @entity3 during @entity5 coverage of the @entity7 derby			1
@entity3 was , of course , one half of the commentary team that was once seen as being the best of the bunch			1
that other half back then being his old partner @entity14			0
nowadays , the man in the gantry alongside him is @entity17			2
and it was his zinger after @entity20 's fourth goal – ' @entity21 has scored			1
it 's a mauling for @entity23 ' – that got the veteran lip mic man reaching for the platitudes			1
and perhaps cementing the new best partnership in the process ? i 'm not sure if @entity17 actually carries his recently won @entity30 of the @entity32 award around with him ? he could probably just about squeeze the perspex trophy into his inside jacket pocket if he really fancied it , but i doubt he would because i think one thing you could never accuse @entity17 of being is one of the extroverts among the current batch of experts			2
@entity17 in the @entity5 studio after co-commentating with @entity3 for the @entity7 derby @entity21 is pictured scoring for @entity20 as @entity23 goalkeeper @entity43 sees it go in @entity20 defender @entity21 was an unlikely goalscorer against @entity23 and @entity17 had a zinger to match it @entity46 analysed the goal by saying : ' @entity21 has scored			1
it 's a mauling for @entity23 ' nevertheless , on his return to his old stamping ground with that new title attached , it was good to see him to turn it on even just a bit			1
and put in a performance that fitted both his newly anointed status and the magnitude of the occasion			0
@entity17 was all over this thrilling derby right from the get go			1
' we 've got a proper game of football here , ' he extolled early on , almost licking his lips at the prospect			0
he was also quick to point out what he saw as the ' graveyard ' of @entity23 's right - hand side as @entity20 punished them time and time again along the hosts ' attacking left			1
the razor - edged corner of tongue was saved not exclusively , but certainly frequently for @entity76 's performance			2
time and time again @entity17 found himself talking about the various patches of grass in which he felt @entity76 should be but very rarely was			2
and when co-commentator @entity3 did observe that he could see @entity76 finally picking up his man , @entity17 snorted his retort			1
' that 's nice of him			0
' he was in equally abrupt mood after the game when he joined @entity84 and @entity85 for what was a really sharp , incisive and no - holds - barred post-match discussion			0
time and time again @entity17 found himself analysing @entity76 's poor performance for @entity23 @entity76 could do little for @entity23 as they suffered a 4 - 2 defeat by their great rivals united at @entity90 @entity17 ( right ) and @entity92 's @entity91 form a dynamic @entity94 duo here @entity76 carried on getting it from @entity17 - who referred to the ' dereliction of duty ' in his performance before adding that @entity76 's recent form was : ' not a conundrum anymore			1
he can not do his job			0
' what 's more , he was equally gobsmacked by @entity76 's team - mates ' lack of urgency when @entity107 scored a late second			1
' i ca n't quite work out whether to get a little bit wound up by this ? i 'm looking at their reaction			0
is that right ? ' he asked			0
however , let 's not assume this criticism is all because @entity17 is simply red			1
on discussing @entity23 's immediate @entity119 - affected future , he made it quite clear where he stands			1
' i 'm a @entity20 fan , ' he pointed out , pointlessly			2
' but the last thing i want to see is @entity23 dip back down again to the second or third division because they ca n't challenge because there 's some restrictive rule in place			2
' we do n't want a @entity129			0
' @entity17 was damning in his analysis of @entity23 and freely admits he is a @entity20 fan after his years of service @entity17 was gobsmacked by the @entity23 players ' lack of urgency when @entity107 ( above ) scored a second this turned out to be not only the right moment , but also the right kind of game to make that point			1
early in the coverage , host @entity142 told us ' the eyes of the football world ' were watching			0
over shots of a touchline teeming with camera crews , he went on to inform us there were ' 22 broadcasters here ' and that the game was ' being beamed to over 100			0
' @entity5 then went on to present those broadcasters with exemplary game coverage coupled with some lovely vignettes of the occasion			0
as well as a close up of the deep set , brooding eyes of @entity159 that may haunt me for a fortnight			0
all in all , it was great coverage of a great game in a genuinely great league			0
as confirmed by a ton of countries , and @entity7 's own @entity17 .			2

@entity20 beat their rivals @entity23 4 - 2 at @entity90 on *sunday*
@entity17 was co-commentator with @entity3 for the derby
' @entity21 has scored . it 's a mauling for @entity23 , ' said @entity17 at one point
the former @entity20 defender 's commentary was fit for the occasion
