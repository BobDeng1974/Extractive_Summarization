dust from a comet has been discovered on the @entity3 's surface for the first time , locked inside the ancient ice sheet that covers @entity6			1
the discovery is expected to reveal new clues about how our solar system formed as scientists study the tiny comet particles more closely			2
researchers found the comet dust after drilling almost 58 feet ( 17 metres ) into the @entity6 snow at a place called @entity17 , around 10 miles north of the @entity19 @entity18			1
they were initially thought to be the remains of meteorites that have broken up in the @entity3 's atmosphere in the past			1
however , when scientists examined 40 of the particles more closely , they found they were identical to the kind of material that has been gathered from comets , known as chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles			1
the discovery is considered to be particularly surprising because the highly porous fragments are extremely fragile and were not thought to be able to survive @entity3 's weather			1
to find them on one of the harshest environments in the planet is perhaps even more surprising , but it was probably the extreme cold that helped to preserve them , trapping them in the ice			0
professor @entity60 , lead author of the study and a meteorite researcher at @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity19 , said : ' in this paper we report the discovery of more than 40 chondritic porous micrometeorites in the surface snow and blue ice of @entity6 , which are indistinguishable from chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles			1
' it is therefore considered that chondritic porous micrometeorites are chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles that have fallen to @entity3 and have survived the terrestrial environment			2
' comets are some of the oldest objects in the solar system and are thought to be made from the material left over from when our solar system first formed			0
composed of a combination of ice and rock , some scientists believe they may have been responsible for first bringing water and organic molecules to @entity3 that led to the formation of life			0
fragile comet particles were not thought to be able to survive the environment here on @entity3 but the cold temperatures in @entity6 locked them inside ancient ice , helping to protect them from the environment comets leave behind a distinctive tail of dust and gas , which is produced as they heat up and become unstable @entity100 passed close to the @entity101 in november 2013 and @entity103 scientists have been searching in @entity6 for dust particles that may be carried to @entity3 by the solar wind - the latest findings will raise hopes by studying them , researchers hope to gain an insight into how our solar system evolved and perhaps even unlock how life first began on our planet			1
until now scientists have only been able to obtain comet dust by flying missions high in the @entity3 's atmosphere , where tiny particles left behind from the tails of passing comets can be collected			1
however , this can be painstaking work , with several hours of flying yielding just one particle of dust			0
already the @entity125 scientists , whose work is published in the journal @entity3 and @entity128 , have found dozens of particles from comets and with thousands of others in their sample still to be identified , the haul could be huge			2
the dust in @entity6 is also cleaner as it can be filtered from the melted ice , while dust collected in the atmosphere becomes coated in oils used to trap the particles , making them difficult to study			2
recently @entity140 flew a mission to the comet wild 2 ( seen in the gif to the right ) where its @entity146 spacecraft collected samples of dust and returned them to @entity3			1
the @entity19 scientists found features in their comet dust samples from @entity6 that are almost identical to those seen in the dust collected by @entity146 and those collected in the atmosphere			1
they have yet to determine the age of the ice where the particles were found , which may help to reveal when they fell to earth			0
the particles they found were spherical and measured between 10 micrometres to just over 60 micrometres			0
these were composed of a glass like material with metal and sulphides embedded in them			0
they also featured whisker like crystals of the mineral enstatite			0
professor @entity60 said : ' they also contained low - iron – manganese - enriched and low - iron – chromium - enriched ferromagnesian silicates , kosmochlor - rich high - calcium pyroxene , roedderite and carbonaceous nanoglobules			2
' these components have previously been discovered in primitive solar system materials such as the cometary particles recovered from the @entity183 comet			0
' the most outstanding feature is the presence of kosmochlor - rich high - ca pyroxene and roedderite , which suggest that they have building blocks in common cometary dust particles			0
' the results have excited planetary scientists around the world as it offers a rich source of comet material for study and checking against the results from dust collected in the atmosphere			2
the comet dust was found among thousands of meteorite particles in ice 58 feet deep at @entity17 , where several glaciers meet 10 miles north of the @entity19 @entity18 in @entity6 the scientists found ' whiskers ' of the mineral enstatite ( shown above ) similar to those found in comet dust speaking to the journal @entity211 , dr @entity212 , from the @entity213 in @entity214 , said : ' it ’s very exciting for those of us who study these kinds of extraterrestrial materials , because it opens up a whole new way to get access to them			1
' they ’ve found a new source for something that ’s very interesting and very rare			0
” earlier this year @entity103 scientists announced they hoped to collect fresh dust particles in @entity6 from the @entity100 that may fall there after it lit up the sky in november 2013 when it had a close encounter with the @entity101 although they have still to announce any results , the latest findings will raise hopes that they will be able to survive the fall to @entity3			1
the @entity19 work builds on work by @entity237 scientists who reported finding unusual comet - like fragments in the snow in @entity6			1
dr @entity241 , a meteorite researcher from @entity242 in @entity243 who led that work , said : ' the study of these cometary particles will help shed more light on the material that served for planetary formation			0
' they are the best witnesses that we have of that period of time			0
' take a tour of the @entity255 in @entity6 as a researcher goes for a jog			0

@entity19 scientists discovered comet particles at @entity17 , @entity6
they found more than 40 spherical fragments which contained glass - like material , iron , magnesium , *potassium* , sulphur , calcium and nickel
dust is similar to comet fragments collected by @entity140 's *stardust* mission
comet particles were not thought to be able to survive on @entity3 's surface
