in the orthodox jewish community , where only men are allowed to file for divorce - one @entity5 rabbi became an advocate for the women by threatening and beating their husbands into submission			1
without a divorce paper called a ' get ' women who have separated from their husbands are unable to marry again , and have little resources to provide for themselves and their families , which can lead to desperate situations			1
rabbi @entity16 offered these women an alternative			1
charging thousands of dollars , he would allegedly torture his fellow @entity19 men into signing the gets and freeing their wives			2
but the 69 - year - old 's operation came crashing down in a sting carried out by the @entity23 last year			2
now , @entity24 is largely confined to his home in @entity26 , @entity27 as he waits a trial scheduled for early next year			1
if convicted on multiple counts of kidnapping , he could be sent behind bars for 25 years to life			2
ringleader : rabbi @entity16 ( pictured ) is the man accused of leading a group who tortured fellow @entity19 men into agreeing to divorce their wives			1
in the @entity19 community , only the husbands are allowed to file for divorce a recent article in @entity41 traces his work in the community where he is considered both a bully and a savior			1
for years , @entity24 's business obtaining ' gets ' was not a big secret among the @entity19 of @entity47 and @entity27 , who consider it blasphemous to report such crimes to secular law enforcement			1
but @entity24 had been on the @entity23 's radar since the early 1990s when a group of @entity19 men came forward to detail traumatic experiences in which they were beat up or threatened by men who forced them to agree to a divorce			1
victim : @entity60 ( pictured ) was beat up in october 2010 by a man named @entity62 who says he was working for @entity24 to obtain a ' get ' for @entity60 's wife in israel all of the men pointed to @entity24 as the man responsible , but there was n't enough evidence to pin him then			2
' for a long time , it was always his name that came up			0
he was beating guys up , he was giving them bloody noses , he was using cattle prods			0
he had a gang of thugs , and he had a van , and he 'd scoop you right off the street , ' says @entity47 therapist @entity80 told @entity41			0
@entity24 's organization started to unfurl though in october 2010 , when an @entity82 - national named @entity60 was beat up and forced to grant a ' get ' when he traveled to @entity83 after separating from his wife			0
@entity60 was going to the home of @entity62 in @entity26 one night that month , when he knocked on the door and was greeted with a punch in the nose			0
he was then blindfolded and beaten for some time as his captives warned the night would only end in ' a divorce or a funeral '			0
he says the men showed him a body bag so he could ' get used to the size ' , burned him with acid and threatened to take him to the @entity97 where he would be eaten alive by rats			0
fearing for his life , @entity60 agreed to the divorce and to wire his wife $ 100,000			0
surprisingly , @entity60 broke @entity19 code and reported the incident to police , recalling the horrors of the terrifying night			0
@entity62 pleaded guilty to kidnapping last may , but told the court he was only carrying out the crime on behalf of @entity24			2
when police searched @entity62 's house , they found an invoice from @entity110 for a $ 1,311.10 ' emergency carpet installation '			0
@entity62 pleaded guilty to charges of kidnapping last may , but says he was only working for @entity24			2
pictured above in @entity27 court in july 2011 prosecutors said @entity62 was part of @entity24 's syndicate which ' engaged in the business of kidnapping and torturing people , beating them up , tying them up , shocking them with @entity123 and stun guns until they got what they wanted '			1
that incident sparked the @entity23 to intervene , sending undercover agents pretending to be an @entity19 brother and sister to @entity24 's offices to request his services in august 2013			1
the two made up a story about the sister 's husband who was hiding out in @entity83 , refusing to grant a divorce , and @entity24 jumped at the opportunity to help them out - for about $ 50,000			2
the agents recorded the conversations they had with @entity24 , in which he spoke in detail about his fees and how he went about coercing his victims			0
@entity24 even talked about how they used electric cattle prods to torture men , since the tools leave behind no marks on the body as evidence of an attack			2
' if it can get a bull that weighs five tons to move ... ; you put it in certain parts of his body and in one minute the guy will know , ' @entity24 said			0
ouch : @entity24 and his cronies allegedly used a cattle prod to torture their victims into agreeing to a divorce two months later , @entity24 set up a trap for the alleged husband who was ' lured ' back to the @entity5 and set to be surprised by the rabbi and his cronies in a warehouse			1
instead , the warehouse was surrounded by @entity23 agents who stormed in and arrested all eight men			1
six of the eight men have pleaded guilty to charges of traveling in interstate commerce to commit extortion , while @entity24 and another man await trail early next year on multiple counts of kidnapping			1
@entity24 's lawyer @entity186 hopes to win the case on the grounds that the government wrongly interfered in the religious matter			0
' when all the facts and evidence come out , it will be apparent that the government is on the wrong side of a terrible social injustice , ' @entity186 said			0
' by inserting itself into a complicated religious issue , the government has interfered with the complex religious tenets of an @entity19 marriage and divorce process			0
rabbi @entity24 has helped scores of abused women for some thirty years equal the playing field in a male - dominated religious world			1

in the orthodox jewish community , only men may file for divorce
their wives are unable to marry again until their husbands sign a *document* called a ' get '
for years , a @entity27 rabbi @entity16 helped these wives by threatening and even torturing their husbands into signing a get
the @entity23 arrested @entity24 last year and he is currently awaiting trial for kidnapping scheduled for early next year .
