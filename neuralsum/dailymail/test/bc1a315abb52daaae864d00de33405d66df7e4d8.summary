from solar - powered models of the @entity2 to a £ 1,200 @entity4 bust of prince @entity5 , there 's no item of royal memorabilia too big or too small for royalist @entity8			1
the pensioner , 71 , has been collecting royal - themed knick - knacks for more than 40 years and now boasts a collection worth £ 10,000			1
but squeezing it all into her small terraced home has n't been easy and her gargantuan collection now fills four whole rooms , including one dedicated to princess @entity16 alone			1
' there 's loads of royal magazines that i read , so i get up at about 4.30am to keep up with it all , ' she reveals			2
' i 'm retired but i do n't think i 've actually ever worked so hard in my life			0
it takes a lot of work [ to maintain ] but it 's a labour of love			0
' as well as collecting royal memorabilia , mrs @entity8 , a retired charity worker , is also obsessed with meeting the real thing and says she spent six days outside the @entity39 at @entity40 in @entity41 when @entity42 was born			1
' i was there for six days , ' she beams			0
' [ my son ] @entity44 was born at @entity40 and i was only there for two days			0
' i just wanted to feel close to them [ @entity46 and @entity47 ] , i suppose			0
i spent the time meeting people , and @entity50 was convinced it was going to be a girl , but it was n't			0
' extensive : her collection includes china , a solar powered queen and thousands of photos got it ! a copy of the @entity47 's £ 450 @entity61 engagement dress is in the collection although mrs @entity8 , who considers the @entity64 and extension of her own , did n't shake hands with the @entity67 and @entity47 on that occasion , she has met a number of senior royals , among them the @entity2			1
' i 've met a lot of them , ' she reveals			0
' i 've met the @entity2 , i 've met prince @entity44 and prince @entity5 so i 've been very lucky			2
' but despite considering herself lucky to have met so many royals , it is collecting that is her real passion and she has amassed around 10,000 items over 40 years			1
these are stored in four rooms , each with a different royal theme			2
her drawing room is devoted to the @entity2 , while another , known as the @entity87 , has been turned into a £ 75 - a - night @entity88 for royal enthusiasts			2
her front room contains items created for every royal event in the past century , among them the 1953 @entity96 and the 2012 @entity97 , while another space , dubbed ' the @entity95 ' is devoted exclusively to princess @entity16			1
meeting : mrs @entity8 has met several members of the @entity64 including the @entity2 and prince @entity5 favourite : princess @entity16 remains one of mrs @entity8 's favourite royals and has an entire room to her name homage : mrs @entity8 in her princess diana room			1
her favourite painting is seen on the back wall ( centre ) inside are some of her most prized possessions , among them a @entity16 handbag , a set of @entity16 - themed matrioshka dolls and a stained glass window that mrs @entity8 commissioned in 1998 - a year after the princess ' death			1
the room also boasts a fresco of the late princess painted on the ceiling and a large oil painting of @entity16 with her sons @entity46 and @entity122			1
' i think that says it all about @entity16 , ' she says of the painting			2
' she was a mother first and foremost			0
' nevertheless , items devoted to @entity5 and the @entity128 also occupy a considerable amount of the floor - space , as do the @entity67 and @entity47			1
and while much of the collection might be made up of novelty items picked up at @entity41 markets , other items , such as a £ 450 @entity61 dress identical to the one worn by the @entity47 for her engagement announcement , did n't come cheap			2
despite the outlay and her rapidly diminishing space , mrs @entity8 says she will go on collecting royal memorabilia ' forever '			1
' enough is never enough , ' she beams			0
' it 's an ongoing story is n't it ? when @entity46 and @entity145 's baby is born , it will be the @entity2 's fifth great - grandchild			0
' it does n't stop dead			0
you ca n't pretend that life is n't going on for them			0
anyway , i just love it ! not even the dusting gets me down			0
