the endangered frogs have been given a new lease of life after the @entity8 and @entity9 successfully bred the frogs for the first time			2
the rescue project is raising nine healthy frogs from one mating pair and hundreds of tadpoles from another pair			0
cute ! this picture shows a tiny baby limosa harlequin frog , an endangered species native to @entity21 , sitting atop a @entity4 quarter coin			1
researchers have successfully bred the chevron - patterned variety for the first time ' the last hope for their species ' : the @entity8 and @entity9 is raising nine healthy frogs from one mating pair and hundreds of tadpoles from another pair threatened : habitat loss , climate change , pollution , and a virulent fungal disease called chytridiomycosis are all thought to have contributed to the loss of 94 of 120 frog species since as late as 1980 ' these frogs represent the last hope for their species , ' said @entity39 of the @entity40 , international coordinator for the conservation project , in a statement			1

' with nearly one - third of the world 's amphibian species at risk of extinction , the project aims to save frog species in @entity21 , one of the world 's last remaining strongholds for amphibian biodiversity			1

both kinds need highly oxygenated , gently flowing warm water between @entity91 and @entity92 for their tadpoles to survive			0
their natural food is algal film growing on submerged rocks , which researchers replicated by painting petri dishes with a solution of powdered spirulina algae and then allowing it to dry			0
it is hoped that one day the teams working for the project may develop methodologies to reduce the impact of the amphibian chytrid fungus so that one day their captive communities can be returned to the wild .			0
