hate crime : 16 - year - old @entity1 was beaten to death by a mob in @entity4 after they discovered the transgender teen was born a man @entity1 was relentlessly teased in high school for being effeminate until he dropped out			1
his father not only kicked him out of the house at the age of 14 but also helped jeering neighbors push the youngster from the rough @entity4 slum where he grew up			1
by age 16 , the teenager was dead - beaten , stabbed , shot and run over by a car when he showed up at a street party dressed as a woman			1
his mistake : confiding to a friend that he was attending a ' straight ' party as a girl for the first time in his life			2
' when i saw @entity1 's body , i started shaking and crying , ' said @entity29 , one of three transgendered friends who shared a derelict house with the teenager in the hills above the north coast city of @entity35			1
like most transgenders and gays in @entity4 , @entity29 would n't give a full name out of fear			1
it was so , so painful to see him like that			0
' international advocacy groups often portray this @entity46 island as the most hostile country in the @entity48 for gays and transgendered people			1
after two prominent gay rights activists were murdered , a researcher with the @entity53 - based @entity52 in 2006 called the environment in @entity4 for such groups ' the worst any of us has ever seen			1
' local activists have since disputed that label , but still say homophobia is pervasive			0
@entity1 's horrific july 22 murder has made headlines in newspapers on the island and stirred calls in some quarters for doing more to protect @entity4 's gay community , especially those who live on the streets and resort to sex work			1
advocates say much of the homophobia is fueled by a nearly 150 - year - old anti-sodomy law that bans anal sex as well as by dancehall reggae performers who flaunt anti-gay themes			0
the island 's main gay rights group estimated that two homosexual men were killed for their sexual orientation last year , and 36 were the victims of mob violence			2
for years , @entity4 's gay community has lived so far underground that their parties and church services were held in secret locations			1
most gays have stuck to a ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' policy of keeping their sexual orientation hidden to avoid scrutiny or protect loved ones			0
' judging by comments made on social media , most @entity4 think @entity1 brought his death on himself for wearing a dress and dancing in a society that has made it abundantly clear that homosexuals are neither to be seen nor heard , ' said @entity98 , a blogger and publications officer at @entity4 's campus of the @entity101			1
victims : @entity1 's roommate @entity103 , left , and @entity29 were also at the party			1
@entity29 was also beaten and nearly raped in the attack			2
she bares her injuries on the right some say the hostility partly stems from the legacy of slavery when black men were sometimes sodomized as punishment or humiliation			0
some historians believe that practice carried over into a general dread of homosexuality			0
but in recent years , emboldened young people such as @entity1 have helped bring the island 's gay and transgender community out of the shadows			1
a small group of gay runaways now rowdily congregates on the streets of @entity128 's financial district			0
prime minister @entity130 's government has also vowed to put the anti-sodomy law to a ' conscience vote ' in @entity133 , and she said during her 2011 campaign that only merit would decide who got a @entity138 position in her government			0
by contrast , former prime minister @entity140 said in 2008 that he would never allow homosexuals in his @entity138			0
@entity143 , executive director of the @entity144 , @entity145 , said there were increasing ' pockets of tolerance ' on the island			2
' we can say that we are becoming more tolerant			0
and thankfully that 's because of people like @entity1 who have helped push the envelope , ' said @entity143 , one of the few @entity4 gays who will publicly disclose his full name			1
yet rights groups still complain of the slow pace of the investigation into @entity1 ' murder , despite the justice minister calling for a full probe			1
@entity163 spokesman @entity162 said detectives working the case are struggling to overcome a chronic problem : a strong anti-informant culture that makes eyewitnesses to murders and other crimes too afraid or simply unwilling to come forward			0
even though some 300 people were at the dance party in the small riverside community of @entity175 , police have yet to make a single arrest in @entity1 's murder			1
hard life : @entity1 dropped out of school due to harassment and was kicked out of her house by age 14 police say witnesses have said they could n't see the attackers ' faces			1
@entity1 was the center of attraction shortly after arriving in a taxi at 2am with his two 23 - year - old housemates , @entity29 and @entity103			1
@entity1 's expert dance moves , long legs and high cheekbones quickly made him the one that all the guys were trying to get next to			1
like most @entity4 homosexuals , @entity1 was careful about confiding in others about his sexual orientation			1
but when he saw a girl he had known from church , he told her he was attending the party in drag			2
minutes later , according to @entity29 and @entity103 , the girl 's male friends gathered around @entity1 in the dimly - lit street asking : ' are you a woman or a man ? ' one man waved a lighter 's flame near @entity1 's sneakers , asking whether a girl could have such big feet			1
then , his friends said , another man grabbed a lantern from an outdoor bar and walked over to @entity1 , shining the bright light over him from head to toe			2
' it 's a man , ' he concluded , while the others hissed ' batty boy ' and other anti-gay epithets			0
@entity29 says she tried to steer him away from the crowd , whispering in @entity1 's ear : ' walk with me , walk with me			2
' but @entity1 pulled away , loudly insisting to partygoers that he was a girl			2
when someone behind him snapped his bra strap , the teen panicked and raced down the street			2
but he could n't run fast enough to escape the mob			0
the teenager was viciously assaulted and apparently half - conscious for some two hours before another sustained attack finished him off , according to @entity29 , who was also beaten and nearly raped			0
she hid in a nearby church and then the surrounding woods , unable to call for help because she did n't have her cellphone			0
dangerous party : the riverside bar where @entity4 teen @entity1 was targeted for being transgender @entity1 's father in the @entity35 slum of @entity249 did n't want to talk about his son 's life or death			1
the teen 's family would n't even claim the body , according to @entity1 's friends			1
they remembered him as a spirited boy with a contagious laugh who dreamt of becoming a performer like @entity262			0
he was also a street - smart hustler who resorted to sleeping in the bushes or on beaches when he became homeless			0
he won a local dancing competition during his time on the streets and was affectionately nicknamed ' @entity268			0
' ' he was the youngest of us but he was a diva , ' @entity29 said			0
' he was always very feisty and joking around			0
' inside their squatter house , @entity29 and @entity103 said , they still talk to their dead friend			0
' i 'll be cooking in the kitchen and i 'll say , " @entity1 , you hungry ? " or something like that , ' said @entity103 while sitting on the old mattress in her bedroom , flinching as neighborhood dogs barked outside			2
' we just miss him all the time			0
sometimes i think i see him			0
' but down the hall , @entity1 's room is empty except for pink window curtains decorated with roses , his favorite flower			2
empty room : @entity1 ' cleared out room in the squatter house she shared with @entity103 and @entity29			2

@entity1 , 16 , was beaten to death in @entity4 when the transgender teen showed up to a party dressed as a woman
international advocacy groups have called the island nation the most hostile country in the @entity48 for the @entity300
