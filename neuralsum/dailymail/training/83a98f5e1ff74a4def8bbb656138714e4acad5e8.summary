by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:05 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 3 september 2013 warning : chancellor @entity2 said families in @entity4 will be worse off if voters back independence next year people living in @entity4 would each be £ 2,000 better off if they vote against independence , @entity7 claimed today			1
the chancellor said incomes would rise by four per cent after 30 years , equivalent to £ 5billion in today ’s prices			2
but if voters choose to sever ties with the @entity13 in next year ; s independence referendum , @entity4 would have to make ‘ very substantial cuts ’ of up to £ 8billion in public spending , mr @entity2 suggested			1
a new @entity18 report published today says that incomes in @entity4 are likely to increase if the country chooses to stay in the @entity21 rather than vote for independence			0
it argues that ‘ remaining part of the borderless @entity13 could boost real incomes in @entity4 by as much as 4 per cent after 30 years , equivalent to £ 5 billion in 2012 prices or £ 2,000 per household ’			1
the report adds : ‘ @entity28 would fundamentally transform and fragment this relationship , ending the pooling of resources and risk - sharing between @entity4 and the rest of the @entity13 , and erecting a border where one does n’t currently exist			2
by contrast , the analysis suggests that exports from an independent @entity4 to the continuing @entity13 could be over 80 per cent lower after 30 years			1
mr @entity2 , who delivered a speech in @entity40 to the oil and gas industry , said it would take £ 8 billion out of the budget to divert revenue into a an oil fund after independence @entity4 can ‘ go it alone ’ , he said , but as part of the @entity13 it has a broader base to ‘ absorb ’ fluctuations in the revenue			1
he dismissed the idea that @entity4 could set up an oil fund , like in @entity54 , without making severe public spending cuts			1
‘ by our calculation you 'd have to make some very substantial cuts - £ 8 billion of cuts - to @entity4 public spending , ’ he told @entity58 @entity4 's @entity57 programme			0
‘ even if you were getting all the money from @entity4 oil , you 'd have to make big , big cuts – 5 per cent of the gdp - to your education budget , to your health budget , before you could even start putting money into an oil fund			1
’ however , the claims were dismissed by the @entity4 government			2
a spokesman for deputy first minister @entity76 said : ‘ with household budgets expected to fall by £ 1,800 in the next two years as part of the @entity13 – and at least another four years of cuts to @entity4 ’s budget – it is only a @entity82 vote in 2014 that can deliver real opportunities for @entity4			1
‘ @entity86 ’s economic policies have seen key industries close down , communities abandoned and generations of @entity4 let down			0
’ referendum : voters will have their say on independence on september 18 2014 @entity4 voters will have their say on leaving the @entity13 in a referendum on september 18 next year			0
most opinion polls have shown support for independence in the high twenties			0
but a surprise new @entity100 survey , commissioned by the @entity101 put the @entity82 campaign one point ahead on 44 per cent			1
the @entity18 analysis says that there would be two ‘ fundamental fiscal consequences ’ if @entity4 became an independent country			0
dispute : the @entity28 debate has been dominated by wrangling over the value and access to revenues from @entity4 's oil supplies firstly , @entity4 would need to rely on a narrower and more volatile tax base to fund spending on public services , according to the @entity18			0
secondly , independence would result in the break - up of the @entity13 tax system			0
a separate tax system would need to be implemented in @entity4 with potential implications for business , individuals and both governments			0
mr @entity2 will also unveil the final decommissioning deed - a contract which gives oil and gas companies certainty over the level of tax relief that they will receive for decommissioning			0
@entity4 finance secretary @entity135 said : ‘ @entity137 oil is a bonus , not the basis for @entity4 's economy and , with up to 24 billion barrels of oil left worth an estimated £ 1.5 trillion , it will continue to contribute to the wealth of @entity4 for a long time to come			2
‘ leaving decisions at @entity86 has cost @entity4 30 years of an oil fund and it was only the vociferous arguments of the industry and the @entity148 that prevented investment being set back by years			1
‘ the @entity148 has made clear commitments to the industry that demonstrate the benefits of decisions being made in @entity4 and that means a @entity82 vote next year will secure a strong future for @entity4 's oil industry			2

chancellor claims incomes will rise by 4 *%* if @entity4 stays in the @entity13
warns of £ *8bn* in cuts if independent @entity4 wants an oil fund
but @entity4 government *accuses* @entity86 of letting @entity4 down
surprise poll puts @entity82 campaign ahead for the first time
