by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 01:39 est , 10 may 2012 @entity2 president @entity1 was left red - faced last night after it emerged the star of her controversial @entity5 ad is set to miss the @entity7			1
hockey player @entity10 flew to the islands and worked out on a @entity13 war memorial ahead of the @entity15 games with the boast : " to compete on @entity18 soil , we are training on @entity2 soil			1
" the @entity2 government ignored international criticism to screen the ad repeatedly and use it to launch vitriolic attacks on @entity13			2
the ad starring him , condemned as ' tawdry and cowardly ' by @entity5 survivor @entity35 , was last night expected to be dropped from @entity2 tv screens			1
a source close to the ad agency behind the video admitted : " @entity10 missing the @entity7 would be a bit of an embarrassment			2
' he was picked because we thought he 'd be a dead cert for the event			0
' i suspect the ad will be quietly dropped now			0
' it 's difficult to see how you can make propaganda based on an @entity51 training on disputed territory when it turns out he 's not going to go to the @entity7			0
' another added : ' everyone involved in the project feels pretty silly at the moment			0
' what was trumpeted as a kick in the teeth for @entity13 has turned out to be a spectacular own goal			0
' there 's a little - bit of wound licking going on at the moment			0
' @entity1 never envisaged for one moment when she was making political capital out of the video that @entity10 would be left out of the @entity7			1
' @entity10 , expected to make the cut for what would have been his third @entity7 , has been virtually ruled out after being excluded from the 18 - man @entity2 hockey squad taking part in a 10 - day tournament in @entity73 from may 24			1
his surprise exclusion comes after he received threats on social networking sites for starring in the @entity5 ad			2
the 34 - year - old failed to attend a reception at the @entity80 in @entity81 last night / on tuesday night			0
opening scene : after a caption reading ' @entity5 ' , the @entity2 name for the @entity5 , hockey player @entity10 is seen stepping out early in the morning for a run obvious landmarks : as the advert progresses , @entity10 can be seen limbering up outside the @entity89 , a popular pub in @entity90 passing all the sights : as rousing music reaches its eventual peak , @entity10 jogs past the office of the @entity95 , which today ran quotes from @entity98 @entity97 criticising the advert several teammates accepted the invitation to the event , hosted by @entity13 ambassador to @entity2 @entity104			1
@entity10 's absence from @entity73 - and his expected absence from @entity15 - has been attributed to ' sporting reasons			2
' but it is bound to lead to speculation he has been dropped from the squad because of fears his presence at the @entity7 could cause his teammates problems			0
one critic wrote on @entity117 after the @entity5 ad was first screened : ' i 'm tempted to find out when the @entity2 hockey team is due to arrive in the @entity13 so i can throw eggs at @entity122			1
' another promised to jeer him when he played and dozens called for him to put on the first plane back to @entity81 when he flew in for the @entity127			0
@entity10 was one of three @entity2 athletes who filmed the ad in secret after flying to the @entity5 under the pretext they were running a marathon			1
he enraged locals and falklands war veterans after it emerged he did step - ups on the islands ' @entity138 honouring @entity13 sailors who died battling the @entity142 fleet in 1914			0
he was also filmed running past the office of @entity5 newspaper @entity95 and doing arm - raises outside @entity90 's @entity89			0
iconic @entity13 phone box : there 's little doubt over why the advert 's makers included this shot in the mix the @entity2 office of ad agency @entity153 sold it to @entity1 's office for an undisclosed sum after gifting her a copy			1
it was first screened on @entity2 tv stations last wednesday night , the 30th anniversary of the sinking of @entity2 warship @entity160 during the @entity5 conflict			1
sir @entity163 , chief exec of advertising giant @entity164 which owns @entity153 , later condemned the ad as " totally unacceptable			0
" and @entity13 's defence secretary @entity166 demanded the @entity2 government apologise for sullying the @entity7 ideal with the ad			1
@entity2 's foreign secretary @entity170 responded by accusing @entity13 of killing and maiming innocent civilians in a vitriolic rant at the weekend			2
and on monday @entity1 defended the ad , insisting it reflected @entity2 feelings			1
@entity176 , president of the @entity177 , last night sought to assuage fears his athletes would use the @entity127 to promote the @entity5 cause			2
he said : " @entity181 wants to make it clear that using the @entity7 to carry out political gestures of any kind is unacceptable			0
' we will behave with the correct @entity51 spirit in everything we do in @entity15 and anywhere else			0
' evocative and provocative : a close - up shot shows a hand , supposedly @entity10 's , meaningfully rolling sand through its fingers pointed message : with the rugged countryside in the background : ' to compete on @entity18 soil ' dramatic pause : the most incendiary comment reads : ' we are training on @entity2 soil ' final say : the screen fades to white with the message : ' tribute to the fallen and ex-combatants '			1

@entity10 will ' most certainly ' not compete in the games
the advertisement show the hockey player training on the @entity5 with the *tagline* ' to compete on @entity18 soil , we are training on @entity2 soil
the ad has been condemned by defence secretary @entity166 and @entity5 survivor @entity35 called it " tawdry and cowardly "
president @entity1 said ad ' reflected @entity2 feelings '
