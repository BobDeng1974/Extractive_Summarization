by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 21:15 est , 20 march 2013 the closed - circuit television footage showing a double - amputee marine going through a @entity5 checkpoint does not show him being forced to remove his prosthetic legs , the government agency claimed today , going directly against the complaint a congressman filed against the government agency earlier this week			1
on monday , @entity11 ( @entity12 ) wrote a terse letter to transportation security administrator @entity14 asking why @entity15 was forced to remove his prosthetic legs and later had to stand on them without the use of his wheelchair in what the congressman called a ‘ humiliating ’ experience			1
however , the @entity5 has fired back with their own account , saying that initial @entity24 footage shows @entity25 passing through the security checkpoint at @entity28 ’s @entity27 on march 13 without removing his prostheses			1
the @entity38 currently lives in @entity48 and serves in the @entity49 out of @entity50			2
he and other wounded @entity38 were flying back after a spring training fundraiser , according to @entity52			1
the @entity5 told the @entity53 in a statement : ‘ preliminary review of @entity24 indicates there was no removal of prosthetic limbs			1
’ they added that the two men who conducted the march 13 screening are veterans themselves – one , a @entity38 and the other , an 18 - year veteran of the @entity63			0
@entity64 , @entity65 ’s deputy chief of staff , spoke to @entity66 by phone from the congressman ’s headquarters in @entity70			1
he said that the @entity5 is trying to throw a red herring into the greater argument of how the war - wounded are treated at airport security			1
‘ here ’s the thing – @entity5 ’s going to make you think what they want you to think , ’ he said			0
it was the people who were escorting him			0
they felt disrespected , they felt mistreated			0
the problem here is the situational awareness in the tone and lack of awareness			0
‘ there has to be a part on @entity5 to acknowledge there is an issue – not the leg issue , but the bigger problem that he and other veterans and the war - wounded need extra help			2
that ’s what it ’s all about and that ’s what mr @entity11 was getting at , ’ he said			0
in transit : @entity25 and other wounded @entity38 were in @entity27 for a spring training event ; the alleged incident happened on march 13 when they were flying back to @entity48 he said that mr @entity11 , a combat veteran himself who served in @entity104 , is passionate about fighting for the rights of @entity107 military members and veterans			1
‘ he understands what ’s involved and there ’s nothing that bothers him more than seeing servicemen mistreated			0
’ the larger issue , mr @entity64 added , is the lack of respect and professional courtesies by @entity5 agents towards those who need extra assistance – something that is difficult to legislate			2
' the problem here is in the tone and lack of awareness			0
there has to be a part on @entity5 to acknowledge there is an issue , the bigger problem that he and other veterans and the war wounded need extra help			2
that ’s what it ’s all about			0
' - @entity138 , @entity11 's chief of staff ‘ as federal agents themselves , they ’re the ones who should know better , first and foremost , ’ he said			1
‘ hearing back from the @entity5 is going to be important , ’ he added , saying that he ’s heard no official response from the government agency since sending the letter via fax on monday , though he added that the process can sometimes take weeks			1
when asked if he could definitively say whether @entity25 was forced to remove his prostheses , mr @entity64 answered that the other veterans who were traveling with him would ‘ stand by it			0
‘ witnesses said he took off his legs , ’ mr @entity64 said			0
‘ at a bare minimum , he was at least asked to take off his legs			0
’ servicemen : @entity25 lost his legs after an explosion in @entity35 ; he is currently stationed in the ' @entity49 ' battalion out of @entity50 he concluded : ‘ all the problems with @entity5 is indicative of the bigger problems they refuse to address , ’ he said			1
fight : rep @entity11 has been vocal in his support of the rights of servicemen the @entity5 has not yet responded to @entity66 ’s request for comment			1
the government agency currently offers a ‘ @entity49 ’ program where injured service members are allowed to go through an expedited screening process , but said it would expand its screening options			0
neither @entity27 nor the @entity5 said they received a complaint from the alleged incident			0
in his original complaint , @entity65 wrote : ‘ these @entity38 had an unfortunate experience , which is worthy of your attention and any explanation you can provide			1
’ in his letter , he included two photographs of the @entity38 , saying they corroborated @entity25 ’s complaint			2
as the @entity181 notes , @entity25 and his fellow @entity38 were initially escorted to the wrong checkpoint			2
@entity65 wrote that no @entity5 officers offered to help him to the correct security checkpoint			1
‘ i would like to know what discretion a @entity5 officer has in this situation as well as the ability of @entity5 officers to assist and individual between screening locations , especially if that individual is unable to walk or move on his or her own , ’ he wrote			2
rep. @entity11 asked in his letter for more sensitivity and awareness when examining military workers			2
