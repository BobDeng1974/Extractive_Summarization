the three - month - old puppy , appropriately called @entity6 , was pinned up against the wall by his seven - year - old mother @entity8 after he became a bit too boisterous			1
his mother decided to step in to deal out the rough justice after @entity6 had been harassing his ten - year - old grandmother @entity12			2
ticking off : @entity6 the three - month - old @entity1 is ' told off ' by its mother wildlife photographer @entity15 captured the action while walking with a friend and their pets on holiday in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the telling - off did n't last too long however as they started to play together before carrying on with their walk			1
he said : ' the dogs were making the most of the sun and the little one was bothering its grandmother			0
' when @entity6 's playful nature got a bit boisterous , his mother stepped in and seemed to tell him off by pressing him against the wall			1
' but it was all in good fun as they had a play with each other before trotting on			0
' the pictures offer a revealing insight into the relationship dynamics between dogs and their parents			0
rough justice : @entity6 was given the stern telling - off after his mother became fed up of his boisterous behaviour sorry mum ! @entity6 appears a little sheepish after his telling off abashed : with his head bowed , @entity6 walks off with his mother after she told him off for being boisterous after the dog has been given its stern telling off he appeared a little crest - fallen , but quickly gather his wits before moving on			2
it should n't come as too much of a surprise the young dog needs keeping in line every now and again - @entity1 's are notorious for wanting to be the centre of attention			0
they also have masses of energy and will always try to challenge authority			0
no wonder @entity6 's mother was not willing to let him get away with his boisterous antics for too long			2
