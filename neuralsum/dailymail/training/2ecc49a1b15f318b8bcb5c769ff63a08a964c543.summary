the old adage of beauty coming from within has been borne out by a new study in which 10 out of 11 female volunteers experienced visible improvements to their skin after just four weeks of adding one bag of watercress a day to their diet			1
one woman even managed to reduce her facial wrinkles by an incredible 39 per cent			2
forget expensive creams , a recent study shows that adding one bag of watercress a day to your diet can improve your skin tone and reduce wrinkles the women , who ranged in age from 23 to 58 , began the trial by having their faces photographed using a @entity42 complexion analysis system which gives a subsurface reading of an individual ’s skin and focuses on wrinkles , texture ( the balance between oily and dry areas ) pores , @entity52 spots , brown spots , red areas ( any underlying redness , inflammation , sensitivity or thinner skin ) and porphyrins ( levels of bacteria on the skin )			1
10 out of 11 volunteers saw a positive improvement in their skin 7 out of 11 saw an improvement in their wrinkles 8 out of 11 saw an improvement in the texture * of their skin 9 out of 11 saw an improvement in their pores 5 out of 11 saw an improvement in their red areas 8 out of 11 saw an improvement in the levels of porphyrins 5 out of 11 saw an improvement in their brown spots 3 out of 11 saw an improvement in their uv spots after four weeks of eating 80g of watercress a day the volunteers had their skin reassessed by the @entity42 camera , and the results were extremely positive			1
the majority of women also reported increased energy levels			0
during the trial the volunteers made no other changes to their usual health and beauty regime			0
they were allowed to eat their daily quota of watercress in any way they chose – in salads , sandwiches , whizzed into smoothies or wilted into pasta , however it was not allowed to be cooked			0
one of the success stories of the study was @entity109 , 54 , a theatre training teacher from @entity110 who saw a 39 per cent improvement in her wrinkles , 13 per cent improvement in her skin texture , 5 per cent per cent reduction in brown spots and 18 per cent improvement in her levels of bacteria			1
she said : ' i ’m absolutely thrilled with the results of the trial and astounded at how my skin has improved in almost every aspect			2
' it feels smoother to touch , looks plumper and best of all my wrinkles have reduced ! i had a particularly stressful few weeks at work and thought it would have a negative effect on my skin so to see such an improvement really is impressive			1
' i have also felt more energised and generally healthier which has helped me deal with the stress			0
@entity7 will certainly be top of my shopping list from now onwards			1
' throughout history , eminent philosophers and doctors have revered the health boosting properties of watercress from the pharaohs in @entity142 and the ancient @entity143 , to the @entity144 and @entity145			0
now , sophisticated science techniques have confirmed folklore beliefs			0
philosophers and doctors have raved about the benefits of watercress for years dr @entity151 , a leading nutritionist and dietician who oversaw the study , said : ' watercress is a rich source of beta carotene needed to quench free radicals , which can cause damage to skin cells			1
' however , in order to work properly a high concentration of @entity162 is also needed to complete this process and watercress again has this in abundance			0
' in addition watercress contains @entity167 which is also important for skin health			2
it is this powerhouse of nutrients and the chain reaction in which they work together which is so important for maintaining good skin			2
' there are plenty of delicious ways that watercress can be incorporated into your diet @entity151 added : ' this study confirms that diet is an important aspect of beauty			0
eating plenty of plant foods including watercress can not only help to slow down the ageing of our skin , but may actually reverse some of the effects of damage			0
' @entity194 member dr. @entity193 , who holds a phd in watercress explained : ' there have been a whole host of scientific studies that have shown that @entity199 can help reduce the ageing of skin , so we were encouraged to carry out our own small pilot study using fresh watercress			2
' we were delighted with the results of the new pilot study which may now be used to secure funding for a larger scale university research programme , as the findings have proved so conclusive			0
' @entity210 for gram , watercress contains more vitamin c than oranges , four times more beta - carotene and vitamin a than apples , tomatoes and broccoli , more vitamin e than broccoli , more calcium than whole milk and more iron than spinach			1
it also contains lutein and zeaxanthin ( 45 times that of tomatoes and more than triple the amount in broccoli )			1
it is also the richest dietary source of @entity234 ( phenylethyl isothiocyanate ) which research suggests can fight cancer .			0
