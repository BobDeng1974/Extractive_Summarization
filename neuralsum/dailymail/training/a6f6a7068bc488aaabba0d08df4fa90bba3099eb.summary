by @entity0 a new oat cereal claims to reduce cholesterol levels as effectively as low doses of statins - but will cost around £ 1 per bowl			1
@entity6 has been shown to cut high cholesterol and blood sugar levels in scientific trials			1
it contains beta - glucan , a soluble fibre derived from oats which is known to positively impact on heart health			1
the @entity17 makers of the cereal claim that one serving a day can cut cholesterol by around 10 per cent and cut the chances of heart disease by 25 per cent			1
a new oat cereal claims to reduce cholesterol levels as effectively as a low dose of statins a bowl of @entity6 provides 3g of beta - glucan			1
most healthy oat cereals contain around a quarter of this amount and porridge just a third			2
@entity33 , which makes @entity6 , claims a daily bowl of the cereal for eight weeks or longer is the same as taking a 20mg dose of statins every day			1
the new cereal has received approval from the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) and has been welcomed by heart health charity @entity42			1
dr @entity44 , from @entity33 , said : ' statins are a powerful drug and are effective at reducing cholesterol but our product does not have the bad side effects			2
' the only side effects are positive			0
' typically the cereal can reduce cholesterol by around 10 per cent if eaten every day for more than eight weeks			1
this is the same as a low dose of statins			0
' if you are on a higher dose , you could have the option of reducing your dose of statins and therefore reducing the chance of side effects such as muscle pain			2
' up to seven million people in the @entity65 are on statins , costing the @entity66 around £ 450million a year			0
dr @entity44 added : ' the compliance rate for statins in the @entity65 is only 50 per cent so we know patients are concerned about the side effects			2
@entity6 provides 3g of beta - glucan , a soluble fibre derived from oats which is known to positively impact on heart health			1
@entity33 who make the cereal claim that one serving a day can cut cholesterol by around 10 per cent and cut the chances of heart disease by 25 per cent ' @entity6 is scientifically proven to reduce cholesterol which is a major risk factor in heart disease			1
' for those who wo n't take statins because of side effects , it 's an all - natural alternative			0
' it 's also a product that 's suitable for diabetics and anyone who wishes to control their blood sugar levels and is therefore at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease			1
beta - glucan works by dissolving in the stomach to form a gel that binds bile acids			1
as the liver produces new bile acid it ' draws ' cholesterol from the blood and carries these out of the body			2
beta - glucan also slows down the uptake of sugars so that insulin response is reduced after every meal			1
this means people stay fuller for longer and are more likely to stick to a healthy diet without the need for snacking between meals			0
@entity119 says it uses only oats which will produce high quality beta - glucan molecules and then uses a process to increase the concentration of these in production			1
@entity126 , dietitian at @entity65 , said : ' @entity6 is a cholesterol lowering product and cholesterol is a prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease			2
' it contains 3g of beta - glucan , which is great			1
porridge typically only contains 1g			0
' i would say this is for people on statins who want an additional cholesterol lowering effect or for people not on statins who want to lower their cholesterol as a preventative measure			0
' potentially you might be able to lower your dose of statins by eating it and taking positive lifestyle measures			0
' as you get older your cholesterol gets higher and if you are eating a product like this you may be able to avoid increasing your statins dose			0
' @entity154 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity156 , today agreed that positive dietary changes could be effective in lowering cholesterol			0
however she warned against patients abandoning statins without consulting with their gp			0
she said : ' it is possible for people to lower their cholesterol by changing their diet and being physically active			0
' however , statins are prescribed if someone is assessed to be at significant risk of having a heart attack or stroke			0
' they have been scientifically proven to reduce this risk and millions of people take them safely			0
' if a person wishes to stop taking their statin they are advised to discuss the risks of doing so with their gp			0
' @entity6 will be available in health stores and major pharmacists from september			2
@entity33 say it will cost around £ 1 per daily serving .			0
