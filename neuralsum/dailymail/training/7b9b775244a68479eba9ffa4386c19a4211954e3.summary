the retuning will start in 2019 – possibly earlier			1
meanwhile the companies that run the network of masts could face a bill of £ 470million to install equipment needed to cope with the change			2
this could be at least partly funded through the @entity31 licence fee			0
the radical overhaul has been challenged by a company called @entity34			0
the firm , which is owned by the @entity31 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 – who own and operate the transmitter network – warned that the move will be expensive and disruptive for viewers			2
