by @entity0 follow @ @ charliefscott @entity2 legend @entity1 thinks the 2002 @entity4 squad he was part of is better than every other @entity2 team ever – apart from the side that won the trophy in @entity9 in 1970			1
though many people believe the side that lost in the @entity13 final against @entity14 was one of @entity2 ’s best teams ever , the striker disagrees			1
‘ the 1998 team was n’t as solid [ as the 2002 side ] , ’ @entity1 told fourfourtwo			2
‘ i dare to say that team of 2002 was better than all the others @entity2 sent to a @entity4 , except for the 1970 team			2
world - beater : @entity1 peels away after scoring in the 2002 @entity4 final against @entity24 ‘ that 2002 team was very balanced : it had great defenders and great strikers			1
we could stop anyone and we could score at any time , against any team			0
there was jogo bonito and there was strategy			0
‘ it was n’t as brilliant in 1994			0
much less in 1998 , although we did pretty well before the final			0
the 2002 team earned @entity2 credibility , especially after our win over @entity39 in the round of sixteen			2
’ goodbye : @entity1 's final @entity4 game in 2006 dejection : the @entity45 looks devastated in 1998 the 2002 tournament was @entity1 ’s third @entity4 , though it was the first time he was able to show his best form in a final			1
he was called up to the 1994 @entity4 squad as a 17 - year - old , but did not play any part as @entity2 won the trophy for the fourth time in @entity54			1
four years later the stage looked set for the striker to lead his nation to victory in @entity14 , but he suffered convulsions and lost consciousness for several minutes before the final against the hosts			1
the initial team sheet did not include the forward because of the episode , though he did play as @entity2 were thrashed 3 - 0 , with @entity1 some way from his brilliant best			1
in 2002 , @entity1 was able to get redemption , winning the @entity68 and scoring twice in @entity2 ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity24 in the final			1
squad member : @entity1 ( number 20 ) celebrates on the sidelines after @entity75 scores in 1994 in his prime : a jubilant @entity1 celebrates scoring @entity2 's first against @entity77 in the 1998 semi-final snapshot : @entity1 slots the ball past @entity24 goalkeeper @entity81 in the 2002 final speaking of that win , he said : ‘ no one slept from take - off in @entity86 to landing in @entity2			1
‘ there is a connection in the middle and i ca n’t remember where exactly because the party was in full - flow by then			0
surprise ! @entity1 has guest - edited the latest fourfourtwo ‘ but we deserved it ! after we arrived in @entity2 , the celebrations went on for two more days			2
we were so worn out in the end			0
’ @entity1 started all five of @entity2 ’s games at the 2006 @entity4 in @entity24 , scoring three goals to become the leading all - time scorer in @entity4 tournaments			1
@entity2 lost to a @entity103 - inspired @entity14 in the quarter - finals , though @entity1 ’s goalscoring record has remained until this year			1
@entity106 equaled the @entity45 ’s tally of 15 during @entity24 ’s group matches , and could surpass the former @entity110 star with @entity24 into the quarter - finals after beating @entity112 in extra-time on monday			0
to celebrate its 20th birthday , football magazine fourfourtwo asked @entity1 to guest - edit a special edition			2
@entity1 worked with the fourfourtwo team to deliver the edition , which includes a special birthday photoshoot , as well as an in - depth feature on the great man ’s life			0
and he wrote about his role in an editor ’s letter at the front of the special edition			0
‘ it was no picnic			0
i had to do things i ’ve never done before , like suggest ideas for stories and get people for interviews ( @entity136 , you ’re my man ! )			0
‘ i can now say that scoring goals is easier than editing a magazine ! '			0
