by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:38 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 07:46 est , 16 january 2014 political heavyweights are to be ordered to measure their waistline in an attempt to get @entity6 to set an example to the nation			1
a letter backed by ministers is to be sent to every mp and peer urging them to check that their waist is less than half their height - a key indicator of having a healthy weight			1
former surgeon @entity18 of @entity19 is now stalking the corridors of power to put pressure on @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity25 members who accuses of ‘ eating too much of the gross national product ’			1
strain : it is claimed the green benches of the @entity31 and the red benches of the @entity33 are straining under the weight of gluttonous politicians the government has warned that @entity37 has even fallen behind the @entity38 in failing to deal with the obesity crisis			1
scientists say that by 2050 , half of women , almost two - thirds of men and a quarter of children will be obese			1
but earlier this week the @entity46 said these predictions were ‘ optimistic ’ and underestimated the ‘ true scale of the problem ’			0
lord @entity18 , a former professor and director of surgery at @entity51 , @entity52 , said that the rise in obesity is ‘ the worst epidemic for 90 years and the cure is free ’			1
lord @entity18 insists he ‘ easily ’ meets the target , and credits it to a former patient			1
as a surgeon in his forties he was on his way to a black tie event , wearing a second - hand - and rather tired - dinner suit when he was called to hospital			1
he was asked to see a patient with an inoperable tumour , who urged him to operate and promised to make him a new suit if it worked			0
‘ she survived another seven years and during that time she made me a black tie outfit so i have to stay in the same shape in tribute to her , ' he revealed			2

‘ they are eating too much of the gross national product			0
’ lord @entity18 said overweight politicians could not be seen lecturing the public on their eating habits			1
‘ i think the whole nation is at fault			0
we have got to get the whole nation moving on this			0
‘ it looks bad if politicians are telling the people what to do and they are not doing it themselves			2
’ the letter has been backed by health minister @entity112 , who said he supported ‘ any measure that encourages us all to improve our diet , to reduce physical inactivity and to be aware of what we need to do to keep our weight under control ’			1
@entity78 complain that they have piled on the pounds after being elected to the @entity31			0
communities secretary @entity120 , who has been the butt of many jokes about his size , once boasted that his secret to trying to lose weight was ‘ no cheese , no chips , no seconds ’			2
it came after @entity130 said mr @entity120 was the ‘ only cabinet ¬ minister who you can spot on @entity133 ’			0
most senior politicians face pressure to keep their weight under control			1
mr @entity130 claims to have lost a stone after taking up kick - boxing , after pictures of his paunch on holiday in @entity143 triggered headlines asking ' who ate all the paella ? ' @entity147 is often seen jogging in @entity148 and at @entity150 's questions revealed his wife @entity151 would strongly support him giving up a sweet treat for one day in a so - called ' war on sugar '			0
big beasts : communities secretary @entity120 ( left ) has suggested his secret diet involves ' no chips , no cheese , no seconds ' while @entity160 , when health secretary , admitted that based on @entity162 he was borderline obese @entity160 , when health secretary , admitted that he was overweight and borderline obese			0
speaking in may 2012 he said that at 6ft 1in and just over 15st , he had a @entity162 of 28			0
a ‘ healthy ’ @entity162 score – used by doctors as a height / weight ratio – falls between 18.5 and 25			1
but lord @entity18 argues that the waist - height ratio is a better gauge of unhealthy fat around the stomach			1
some find the struggle to shed the pounds so great they have signed up to @entity6 ’s very own slimming club			1
members the @entity175 group include former culture secretary dame @entity176 , former home office minister @entity177 , @entity23 mps @entity178 , @entity180 and @entity181 and several peers			0
the fifteen women and five men get free membership , saving them £ 235 - a - year each			0
former culture secretary @entity176 is a member of parliament 's @entity175 group and @entity189 prime minister @entity188 has spoken of his battle with bulimia former @entity23 chancellor @entity192 , father of tv chef @entity193 , wrote his own weight loss guide - the @entity195 - which helped him to shed five stone in a year			2

explaining his battle with bulimia , he revealed he would ' sup a whole tin of condensed milk ' , eat trifles ' forever ' and gorge at his local @entity214 restaurant before vomiting			0
experts claim the waist - to - height ratio is a better measurement of health health experts now believe that central obesity ( fat round the mid-section ) is increasing at a faster rate than general weight			1
so relying solely only on @entity162 ( @entity162 ) may provide inaccurate estimates of the childhood obesity epidemic , according to new research by @entity228 , published in public health journal			2
fat around the stomach is thought to be riskier than elsewhere on the body because it has a more direct effect on vital organs			2
yet @entity162 , which compares weight with height , does not take into account where on the body fat is found			1
tummy fat produces more dangerous chemicals , and it is also closer to the body ’s vital organs than flab on the bottom , hips and thighs			2
a staggering 60 per cent of teenage girls are obese by the time they reach 16 , according to research that measures waistlines rather than @entity162			0
the waist of the average 15 - year - old girl has expanded nearly 13cm ( 5in ) in the past two decades , according to a study which finds that many children are even fatter than previously thought .			2
