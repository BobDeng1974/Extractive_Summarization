astronomers have spotted a turbulent planet , 25,000 light - years away , that is four times as massive as @entity4			1
the exoplanet is part of a double - star system known as @entity8 around 19 times farther away from its parent star – the same distance as @entity4 and the sun. the alien @entity4 may help scientists explain solve the mystery about the origins of the ice giants in our solar system			1
astronomers have spotted a turbulent planet , 25,000 light - years away , that is four times as massive as @entity4 ( pictured )			1
the exoplanet is part of a double - star system known as @entity8 around 19 times farther away from its parent star – the same distance as @entity4 and the sun astronomers have discovered hundreds of planets around the @entity25 , including rocky planets similar to @entity27 and gas planets similar to @entity29			1
but there is a third type of planet in our solar system - part gas , part ice - and this is the first time anyone has spotted a twin for our so - called ' ice giant ' planets , @entity4 and @entity40			1
while @entity4 and @entity40 are mostly composed of hydrogen and helium , they both contain significant amounts of methane ice , which gives them their bluish appearance			1
given that the newly discovered planet is so far away , astronomers ca n't tell anything about its composition , but its distance from its star suggests that it 's an ice giant the astronomers spotted the planet due to a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing — when the gravity of a star focuses the light from a more distant star and magnifies it like a lens			1
the light curve of the @entity65 microlensing event is pictured pictured are storms on @entity4 captured august 5 huge storms have been erupting on @entity4 – and they are so enormous they can be easily seen using telescopes on @entity27			2
the swirling clouds and violent winds are being driven by massive bands of jet streams that can surround the entire planet			0
astronomers in @entity76 said they were ' surprised ' by the bright storms they observed this week , including one that they described as ' monstrous '			0
@entity4 boasts a thick atmosphere with winds blowing at 560 mph ( 900 km / h )			2
it has massive storms that could engulf continents on @entity27 , and temperatures in the -220 ° @entity86 ) range			0
scientists believe the planet 's strange tilt is the reason behind this bizarre weather system			2
the @entity27 has seasons because the axis tilts , and the hemisphere tilted towards the sun gets more light than that the region tilted away			0
but @entity4 has an axis that runs almost parallel to the plane			2
this causes 21 - year - long seasons and unusual cold weather			0
the newly discovered planet leads a turbulent existence : it orbits one star in a binary star system , with the other star close enough to disturb the planet 's orbit			1
the discovery was made by an international team led by @entity113 , a researcher at @entity114			0
' nobody knows for sure why @entity4 and @entity40 are located on the outskirts of our solar system , when our models suggest that they should have formed closer to the sun , ' said professor @entity121 at @entity122			1
' one idea is that they did form much closer , but were jostled around by @entity29 and @entity126 and knocked farther out			2
' ' maybe the existence of this @entity4 - like planet is connected to interference from the second star , ' he added			1
' maybe you need some kind of jostling to make planets like @entity4 and @entity40			1
' the binary star system lies in our @entity25 galaxy , in the direction of @entity139			2
the first star is about two thirds as massive as our sun , and the second star is about one sixth as massive			0
the astronomers spotted the planet due to a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing — when the gravity of a star focuses the light from a more distant star and magnifies it like a lens			0
very rarely , the signature of a planet orbiting the lens star appears within that magnified light signal			0
in this case , there were two separate microlensing events , one in 2008 that revealed the main star and suggested the presence of the planet , and one in 2010 that confirmed the presence of the planet and revealed the second star			0
' we were lucky to see the signal from the planet , its host star , and the companion star , ' said professor @entity113			0
' if the orientation had been different , we would have seen only the planet , and we probably would have called it a free - floating planet , ' he added			0
both observations were done with the 4.2ft ( 1.3 metre ) @entity176 at @entity177 in @entity178 as part of the @entity180			0
' nobody knows for sure why @entity4 and @entity40 are located on the outskirts of our solar system , when our models suggest that they should have formed closer to the sun , ' said professor @entity121 at @entity122			1

planet is part of a double - star system known as @entity194 - @entity193
it is first time a twin has been found for ' ice giants ' @entity4 and @entity40
nobody knows why the ice giants are located on solar system 's outskirts
one theory is they formed closer , but were jostled out by other planets
@entity211 scientists believe this *latest* planet could help solve that mystery
