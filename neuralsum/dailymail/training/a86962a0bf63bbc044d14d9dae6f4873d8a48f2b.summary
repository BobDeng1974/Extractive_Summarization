by @entity0 the ability to discern pitch and to hear the difference between similar - sounding words relies on specialised cells within the inner ear , which can be damaged			1
for the first time , scientists have discovered what controls the cells ’ development and pattering			1
they studied the development of these cells in chickens , which unlike humans , have the capacity to regrow sound - detecting cells after suffering hearing loss			1
scientists have discovered what controls the development and pattering of cells in the inner ear			1
they studies their development in chickens , which can regenerate damaged cells			1
a coloured microgram of the hair cells that detect pitch are pictured , with stereocilia ( hair - like microscopic protrusions ) in blue pitch detection occurs within the cochlea , which is a small spiral structure within the inner ear			2
inside the cochlea are specialised cells , known as hair cells , which are tuned to different sound pitches based in part , on their locations along the cochlea ’s spiral and the number and the length of their stereocilia , which are hair - like microscopic protrusions that give the cells their name			0
high - pitched sounds are detected by cells with shorter hair bundles , located closest to where sound enters the ear , while lower - pitched sounds are detected by cells with taller hair bundles located further in			2
this pattern progresses through the several thousand hair cells that are essential for hearing			0
not every single hair cell in the cochlea responds to sounds – only the ones that are sensitive to specific frequencies respond			0
a study by the @entity69 and the @entity70 on @entity71 and communication disorders says that if scientists understand what causes chickens ’ cells to redevelop they could one day replicate the process in humans to reverse hearing loss			1
@entity81 of the university said that if both a human and a hen were to be exposed to a sound loud enough to destroy the ability to hear a certain pitch , the outcomes would be very different			0
‘ we would lose the ability to hear that sound for the rest of our lives			0
' the bird also would lose the ability , but within 10 days , it would have its cells back – they would hook back up to the nerves and within a few weeks its hearing would be back and almost indistinguishable from before			0
’ ‘ eventually therapies [ for humans ] will come about from this regenerative approach and these new discoveries will be a critical component , ’ he said			0

egg - straordinary ! experts believe that if they can understand what causes chickens ' cells to redevelop , they could replicate the process in humans , which could potentially reverse hearing loss one day high - pitched sounds are detected by cells with shorter hair bundles , located closest to where sound enters the ear , while lower - pitched sounds are detected by cells with taller hair bundles located further in			1
this pattern progresses through the several thousand hair cells that are essential for hearing			0
@entity141 , lead author of the two papers , which are published in @entity143 , explained : ‘ when you hear different sounds , not every single hair cell in the cochlea is responding - only the ones that are sensitive to the specific sound frequencies			0
’ until now , scientists have not understood what orchestrates the formation of this pattern of individually distinct hair cells			0
but now they have solved that mystery , demonstrating that two specific molecules - @entity157 and retinoic acid - guide cells to acquire location - specific attributes			1
@entity157 starts the initial patterning process and retinoic acid regulates how the cells ’ hair bundles grow to different lengths			1
dr @entity141 found evidence that there are different levels of retinoic acid activity along the length of the cochlea , so he tried adding more retinoic acid in cells grown in a lab dish and found that they produced longer hair bundles			2
then he used a drug to block retinoic acid ’s activity and found that resulted in shorter bundles			2
he noted that when chickens regenerate damaged hair cells , the new cells develop with just the right characteristics for cells in those particular locations along the cochlea			2
‘ so the question is , are developmental signals like @entity157 and retinoic acid involved in re-establishing the pattern of hair cells and restoring hearing to the regenerating cochlea ? ’ he asked			1
he believes the creation of signals for reactivating regeneration of the molecules is a ‘ tantalising ’ path for developing new treatments for hearing loss .			1

scientists at the @entity69 have discovered what controls chickens ' inner ear cells ’ development and pattering
they studied *animal* *'s* capacity to regrow sound - detecting cells after suffering hearing loss
experts *pinpointed* two molecules – @entity157 and retinoic acid - that guide damaged cells to acquire special attributes and regenerate themselves
the *research* could one day help scientists reverse hearing loss in humans
