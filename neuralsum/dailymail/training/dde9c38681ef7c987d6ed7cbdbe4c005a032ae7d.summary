by @entity0 a coroner has today condemned the ' chaotic response ' of an ambulance service after a baby girl died when an emergency vehicle got lost and a second stopped for petrol			1
three - month - old @entity7 died at hospital after she suffered a fit and stopped breathing at her home in @entity11 , @entity12			1
paramedics took 26 minutes - more than three times longer than national targets dictate - to arrive and @entity12 coroner 's court @entity16 today said the delay was ' wholly indefensible '			1
' wholly indefensible ' : the coroner criticised the ' catalogue of catastrophes ' in reaching @entity22 ( pictured )			1
her mother @entity23 ( left ) is considering launching legal action against the ambulance service he concluded the baby girl died from congenital heart disease after delays in medical assistance reduced her chances of survival			1
the inquest at @entity34 heard how an emergency first response car struggled to find the new build house because its satnav was not up - to - date and ' there were too many blue doors '			2
an ambulance also diverted to the house following the emergency call at 11.09am on 3 march was delayed because it was low on fuel and stopped at a petrol station			2
controllers failed to tell the paramedics that an air ambulance had also been dispatched - if they had known they would not have needed to refuel			0
recording a narrative verdict , mr @entity16 criticised the delays			0
he said : ' by anyone 's standard this was a grave emergency - what happened here was a long , long way from the eight minute response target			0
' it is a fact that the prospect of a child surviving a cardiac arrest are low			0
notwithstanding that the chance of resuscitation are improved if attempted immediately			0
parental grief : @entity66 wipes the tears of her partner @entity68 as they left @entity7 's inquest distraught : the couple said they ' will always believe in our hearts ' that she was let down by the health service ' the delay in giving @entity7 the care that she needed was wholly indefensible			1
there was a catalogue of catastrophes and a chaotic response			1
' mr @entity16 described @entity7 as a ' star which will always shine ' adding : ' she will never grow up , she will never lose her innocence , she will always be loved			1
' after the inquest the @entity86 apologised for the delays and said steps had been taken to avoid future tragedies			0
but @entity7 's parents , @entity66 and @entity68 , said they were considering civil action against the trust			1
they said : ' we will always believe in our hearts that @entity7 was let down by the health services when she was at her most vulnerable and when she needed help the most			2
' @entity99 , who was travelling in the ambulance , said that she and her colleague , @entity102 , had not been told an air ambulance was also on its way			0
under fire : the @entity106 has apologised to the @entity7 family for the delays because of the mistake , they believed they would be required to take @entity7 to hospital rather than simply administer care at the scene			2
she added : ' if we had known the air ambulance had been sent , we would have got straight to the property			0
' the inquest heard that because of the problem with the trust 's mapping system , crews were regularly forced to ' zone ' to nearby areas and use local knowledge to find exact addresses			0
@entity127 , interim director of clinical quality at the @entity129 , said : ' i would like to express my condolences to the family			2
the trust 's response to @entity7 was delayed for a number of factors , primarily the difficulty in locating the address due to it being a new build			1
' as a result , a number of specific measures have now been put in place , and the trust has raised the problems of the delay in new buildings and developments appearing on maps and sat nav systems on a national level			0
' in addition , the trust is recruiting more frontline staff and getting more ambulances on the road in order to improve our service for patients			0
