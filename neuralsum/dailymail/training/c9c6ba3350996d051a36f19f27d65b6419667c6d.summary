the top - seeded @entity0 won the most points and wound up with 30 more winners - but also 24 more unforced errors - than @entity11			0
@entity0 is a 17 - time major champion who was facing a woman making her @entity14 debut but there was still a bit of shakiness from the 32 - year - old @entity18 as she served out the final game , losing four break points and needing five match points to close things			2
@entity0 saved all seven break points she faced in the match			0
she improved her record in the first - round matches of majors to 54 - 1			1

ruthless : @entity0 made light work of @entity5 in the opening game her @entity3 campaign victory : @entity0 celebrates her straight sets victory over @entity11 valiant : despite her best efforts @entity11 could do little to stop @entity0 ' powerful play @entity38 and @entity39 also eased into the second round of the @entity3 on the opening day			1
@entity42 's @entity39 , the third seed , won 6 - 3 6 - 0 after the first seven games against @entity45 went against serve			1
@entity46 , seeded eighth , beat the feisty @entity49 @entity48 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) 6 - 3 and then charmed the @entity51 crowd by conducting his on - court interview in @entity7			1
@entity39 set the ball rolling on the main @entity55 show court under overcast skies			2
forecasters warn that intermittent rain is expected over the early days of the tournament			0
wearing a floral print dress perhaps in anticipation of more springlike temperatures , @entity39 took a while to get into her rhythm against @entity45 and both women struggled badly with their service			1
but the @entity67 eventually held for 5 - 3 , after saving three break points , and then broke the @entity69 to take the set			1
the second set however , was a completely different story			0
quick : @entity39 breezed through her game against @entity45 in straight sets ' i think it was a very wet court			2
i think the courts are not always dry , it 's raining every day , so it makes the courts much slower , ' @entity39 said			0
' every two - set match is great in a two - week tournament			0
it 's important that i spent only one hour on court , ' added @entity39 , who played with a heavily strapped thigh			0
she was badly hampered by a knee injury when losing the @entity87 final to @entity88 in march			0
pain : @entity39 said that she could n't play for too long because of the strapping on her thigh @entity38 pushed @entity92 in the @entity94 semi-finals before losing in three sets to the eventual champion and he eased through the first set against @entity48			1
the eighth seed was broken midway through the second but recovered immediately , leaving his 19 - year - old opponent to hurl his racket to the court , shaking his head			0
the @entity49 got increasingly frustrated through the second - set tiebreak , berating himself repeatedly , before @entity38 took it 7 - 1			1
a finely executed forehand slice from the back of the court forced @entity48 to hit long , giving @entity38 a 2 - 0 lead in the third set			1
but it was soon @entity38 's turn to berate himself as a double fault gifted back the break of serve			0
another break in the sixth game put @entity38 on course for a three - set victory and he served out to win on his third match point			2
cool : whilst opponent @entity48 lost his calm @entity119 's @entity118 kept his composure during his victory			2

defending championing eased into a 6 - *2,6* - 1 victory over the wild card entry
the number one seed has 17 majors and is looking to *retain* her title
