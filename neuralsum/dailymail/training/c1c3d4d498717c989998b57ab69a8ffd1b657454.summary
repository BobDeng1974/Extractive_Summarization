by @entity0 one of golf 's most prestigious tournaments could be under threat after a group of travellers started living on the course where it will take place in a few weeks			1
seven caravans and a handful of vans were today parked at the entrance to the @entity13 , which is set to host july 's @entity14			1
the event will feature some of the sport 's biggest stars , including @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
camp : a group of travellers is parked at the @entity13 , where the @entity14 will take place however , one local councillor suggested that it might take months to move the travellers on , because the owners of the course must obtain a court order first			1
' they have pitched up on one of the most prestigious golf courses in the world and all because they know there 's nothing we can do about it , ' said councillor @entity37			0
' we are doing everything possible to attract the best tournaments and the best players to the north - east			0
' what message does this send to people when you see caravans at the front door ? the travellers are actually now laughing at us because they know we ca n't do anything to stop them			0
' travellers : the club has applied for a court order to move the trespassers on from its land venue : the @entity14 will be hosted by the venerable club in july police said they visited the site after the travellers first arrived yesterday morning , but they are unable to move them on because they are on private land			1
the golf club has applied for a court order to force the travellers to leave , but insists that the @entity14 will go ahead as planned			2
however golfer @entity63 , who has worked as a caddy during professional competitions at the club , expressed concerns that the camp could affect the club 's future			0
stars : @entity18 and @entity19 are among the golfers set to play at the @entity14 ' i think the @entity14 will go ahead but it 's not good for the area and there 's a possibility it could disrupt the event and put a downer on the golf , ' he said			2
' having travellers in the area has been terrible with lots of waste getting left all over the place very close to where i live			0
' i 'm massively excited for such a big event to be held in the area and if the traveller site prevents it from coming back it would such a shame			0
