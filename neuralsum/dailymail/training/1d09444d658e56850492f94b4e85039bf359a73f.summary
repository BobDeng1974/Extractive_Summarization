@entity0 today promised to be blasted with a water cannon to prove they are safe , after he ordered three to use on the streets of @entity4			1
the @entity4 mayor went ahead with the order without home secretary @entity7 sanctioning their use , fuelling tensions between the senior @entity11			1
challenged on the radio to face a cannon himself , mr @entity0 said : ' man or mouse			2
alright , you 've challenged me to this			0
i suppose i 'm going to have to do it now			0
' @entity0 , pictured on a visit to @entity22 this week , said he was prepared to face a water cannon to prove they are safe purchase : @entity0 has fuelled tensions at the top of the @entity27 after buying @entity29 's first water cannon for use by mainland police , similar to this @entity33 version mr @entity0 claimed that by spending £ 130,000 on buying , refitting and transporting three second - hand vehicles from @entity33 police now , before they are approved for use , he will save @entity38 £ 2.4 million in the long term			1
challenged on @entity40 by interviewer @entity41 to be filmed standing in front of the water cannon , mr @entity0 initially seemed reluctant , telling him : ' i 'm certainly prepared to do anything to show that they 're safe within reason			1
i 'm not quite sure whether i want to stand in front of a water cannon , i have n't done anything to deserve it			1
' but after a few moments ' consideration , he came round to the idea , telling @entity55 : ' ok			0
alright , you 've challenged me to this			0
i suppose i 'm going to have to do it now			0
' i 'm doing this unfortunately from off - base , so i can see all my poor press people are going to be tearing their hair out			0
never mind , it 's got to be done			0
thanks for that one , @entity55 ! ' mr @entity41 suggested that he and the mayor could stand in front of the cannon together , wearing bright yellow fishermen 's oilskin and sou'wester to protect them from the water			2
water cannon have been allowed in @entity75 since the @entity76 but can not be deployed in @entity77 and @entity78 without mrs may ’s approval			2
mr @entity0 and mrs may are seen as candidates to succeed @entity82 if he fails to achieve a majority at next year ’s @entity84 and stands aside			0
sources at mr @entity0 ’s @entity87 headquarters told @entity88 that the mayor was ‘ frustrated ’ at the lack of decision - making by the @entity92			2
one said : ‘ @entity0 is the mayor , policing in @entity4 is his responsibility , this is his money and he is of the view that this is what is needed			2
‘ the @entity98 have been asking for water cannon since the riots of august 2011			1
’ sources close to mr @entity0 also say that he largely ignores mrs may to the point ‘ he almost never mentions her ’			0
rivals : @entity7 has not yet sanctioned the use of water cannon and the action by the mayor of @entity4 will be seen as a challenge to her authority in the wake of the ' @entity114 ' row over @entity116 extremism in schools the police are allowed to use water cannons on the streets of @entity75 and have done so on several occasions a document from the @entity124 said : ‘ while it was the original intention to wait for the home secretary to take a decision to authorise the use of water cannon , this process is proving time consuming			1
’ mrs may , who has overtaken mr @entity0 in recent months as the clear favourite to succeed mr @entity82 , is known to regard the mayor as a ‘ faintly ridiculous ’ figure			0
mr @entity0 ’s apparent challenge follows claims that the recent spat between the mrs may and education secretary @entity135 was partly fuelled by rivalry for the @entity27 leadership			2
of the three water cannons , two will work in tandem while a third is held in reserve @entity0 , the mayor of @entity4 ( left ) , is in favour of water cannons while @entity147 member @entity146 ( right ) thinks that they are just ' big boys ' toys ' senior @entity98 officers want to buy three 23 - year - old @entity33 water cannon for around £ 30,435 each before the summer			1
the vehicles carry up to 2,000 gallons of water and can travel at speeds comparable to an hgv			1
up to £ 130,000 will need to be spent to convert the machines , buy additional equipment and train officers to work alongside them			0
water in the vehicles ’ tanks is heated to @entity160 ( @entity161 ) to prevent the ‘ onset of medical conditions associated with the shock of being exposed to cold water ’			1
they can be refilled from hydrants or open water and two machines must be used in tandem as a third is kept in reserve			0
a report revealed by the government ’s @entity174 found there was ‘ good evidence ’ that their use had led to serious injuries			0
baroness @entity146 , who sits on a body which scrutinises the @entity98 , said mr @entity0 may be ‘ over confident ’ in buying the machines			1
she said : ‘ it is a possible waste of taxpayers ’ money at a time when the @entity98 is struggling to keep officers on the frontline			2
‘ it is also ignoring the views of the vast majority of @entity38 who do n’t want water cannon , think they will suppress legitimate protest or are a distraction from the police ’s main role			1
‘ we ’ve heard that water cannon would have been useless in the riots , so what exactly will they be for ? it ’s just another big boy ’s toy that we ca n’t afford			1
’ earlier this year , mr @entity0 urged police to get ‘ medieval ’ on rioters as he threw his weight behind proposals to buy water cannon			1
he said police must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming violence like that seen during the 2011 riots			0
but he stressed the chances of the machines being used in the capital , or other mainland cities , remained ‘ vanishingly rare ’			0
police argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds			1
they said it could have helped protect firefighters and paramedics after shops were set ablaze as rioting spread to @entity236 in 2011 .			0
