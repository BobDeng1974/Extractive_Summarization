skin cancer prevention messages have started to become scare campaigns as people are hiding from the sun , increasing the risk of heart - related conditions , a @entity8 scientist claims			1
professor @entity9 says recent research shows that there are more positive benefits to moderate exposure to the sun than there are detrimental effects - despite skin cancer claiming the lives of 2,000 @entity19 every year			1
the clinical and experimental sciences professor , from the @entity21 , made the controversial statements at @entity24 and @entity23 in @entity25 this week			2
he added that there needs to be a greater balance of the negative and positive effects of the sun exposure referring to research published in the @entity41			0
' that may be very important for a high risk group but that high risk group are the minority of the population , ' he told the @entity47			1
' many others would probably very likely tolerate higher than currently recommended exposure levels , provided their skin gets gradually used to this , and their health would benefit from that			0
' however , @entity55 ceo professor @entity54 told @entity56 he disagreed that only a minority of people were at a high risk of danger from the sun. ' certainly fairer skinned people have more of a chance of burning than darker skinned people , ' he said			1
' but there 's a whole range of occupations where people get a lot of sun exposure			2
' ' and also going to the beach is a leisure activity which is very popular across the whole spectrum of society , so i do n't think we are talking about a small sub-group			0
' professor @entity9 claims people are too scared to expose themselves to natural sunlight professor @entity9 says skin cancer prevention campaigns were sending the wrong message to the public			1

' we are a unique country because you 've got a @entity124 population in a climate where they are not as protected naturally because they do n't have as much pigment in their skin so they are more likely to get burnt in intense sunlight , ' he said			2
' you do need some sunlight for things like vitamin d production - so we want them to get a balance			0
' professor @entity54 recommends people download the @entity140 phone app provides a @entity142 scale to show when the safest hours of each day to be outdoors			2
' it shows when it 's three and above in different geographic locations as it 's impossible to get the same message out to everyone because the sun is more intense in the north than in the south , ' he said			0
