sir @entity1 ’s attack on the leadership of the @entity3 has drawn a massive response from @entity5 on sunday readers , who say they feel ‘ betrayed ’ by an organisation they have backed for years			1
the @entity10 cricketing legend , who fronts you forgot @entity13 , a new grassroots campaign , wrote a devastating open letter to the charity in @entity5 last week			1
a small selection of the postbag received by this newspaper in response is reproduced below			1
one reader said that having joined the @entity3 as a founder member aged 16 , he was now resigning			2
another said she was also quitting because of the charity ’s decision to install a wind turbine near its reserve in @entity29			2
since the @entity5 ran the story , the you forgot the @entity13 website has attracted 25,000 hits			1
now a new front in the campaign has opened up following the @entity3 ’s decision to block measures designed to help one of country ’s rarest and most iconic birds – the hen harrier			1
since 1998 , the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) has been pushing for a compromise scheme that would protect both hen harriers and grouse – so allowing them , and the game bird industry on which many jobs depend , to co-exist			0
it is backed by landowners and other conservation groups			0
the idea is known as ‘ brood management ’			0
extra food would be provided on grouse moors for both species , and as harrier numbers recovered , the @entity3 would work with gamekeepers to remove harrier chicks from the moors			1
they would be raised in an aviary , then released back into the wild			0
but at a meeting involving all concerned parties last week , the @entity3 refused to endorse the removal of chicks , although it does support the provision of extra food			1
@entity77 , the @entity3 ’s conservation director , said the society opposed the scheme because the grouse moor industry could not be trusted			0
he said : ‘ the industry has to prove that it can deliver the recovery of hen harriers before we can even consider brood management			0
if chicks were taken from the wild , reared and released , we have little confidence that they would be allowed to fly free from harm			0
’ the @entity3 ’s opposition drew a withering response from sir @entity1			0
he said : ‘ the @entity3 has once again wilfully blocked the government ’s plan for the recovery of hen harriers			2
more and more people are realising that the hen harriers ’ biggest enemy is the @entity3 – not rogue gamekeepers			2
’ @entity101 , a spokesman for the @entity51 , said that industry bodies such as his ‘ utterly condemn any illegal killing , anywhere ’			0
