by @entity0 for @entity1 at 19 , @entity2 tipped the scales at an unhealthy 34st but managed to lose 13st following a @entity5 - funded gastric sleeve operation in 2006			1
but after ' stretching ' her stomach after being unable to regain control of portion sizes , she piled a third of the weight back on and currently weighs 26st			1
now the jobless 27 - year - old says she hopes to go under the knife for a second time - and says an anonymous benefactor has stepped forward with the £ 11,000 cost of a gastric band			1
her taste for sugary carbs such as pasta and cheese sandwiches made her weight problem worse and by the age of 19 , her eating had spiralled out of control			2
so overweight was miss @entity2 , she got breathless while working as a florist and was warned that she might not make it to 30 by doctors			2
by april 2006 , her weight problems had become so bad that she was forced to undergo a gastric sleeve operation to remove three quarters of her stomach			1
over two years , she shed 13st and dropped to a size 22			2
but as her appetite began to increase , the weight began to creep back on			0
' previously a yoghurt or piece of fruit used to fill me up but i started feeling more hungry so ate a little more than normal			0
' i soon began to eat bigger portions and before long , i was able to eat a small meal of pie and mash			0
' her eating escalated , with miss @entity2 rapidly adding chocolate and cheese sandwiches to her menu - despite warnings from doctors			2
now , eight years on from her original operation , she says going under the knife for a second time is the only way forward			0
' i hated clothes shopping and felt fat and frumpy , ' she adds			0
' i knew that the only way i could lose weight again was by having surgery because i could n't control my portion sizes			1
@entity68 gave me comfort and i could n't say no to it			0
' unhealthy : @entity20 , seen here with her mother @entity71 , weighed 30st by the time she was 13 weighty problem : @entity20 , now 27 , was told she would n't see 30 but still finds portion control a challenge but when she approached her gp , miss @entity2 was told that the @entity5 would n't fund any further surgery			1
help , however , came in the shape of an anonymous benefactor who came forward with the £ 11,000 cost of the operation after seeing her on a tv show			1
miss @entity2 , who says she hopes to become a photographer , was overjoyed and will have a gastric bypass and band fitted within the next few months			1
' i 'm struggling to get a job , ' she adds			0
' no - one says it 's because of my weight but i think it might be , so i hope this op will change things			0
' i 'd ideally like to get down to 20st and a size 18			1
i just want to have a happy , healthy life			0
