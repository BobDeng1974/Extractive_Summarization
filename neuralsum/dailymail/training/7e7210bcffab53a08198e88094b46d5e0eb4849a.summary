a woman has been ordered by a @entity2 court to pay $ 12,500 worth in damages to her estranged husband after it was found she had defamed him on @entity5			1
in december 2012 , a post appeared on @entity8 's social media page saying she had ' separated from @entity9 after 18 years of suffering domestic violence and abuse			1
now fighting the system to keep my children safe '			0
but @entity2 district court judge @entity15 ruled ms @entity8 was unable to prove she had been subjected to this behaviour , despite finding holes in mr @entity9 's case			1
@entity8 posted on her social media page that she had ' separated from @entity9 after 18 years of suffering domestic violence and abuse ' ' even applying the extended definition of the words " domestic violence and abuse " , as urged by ms @entity8 , she has failed to prove any essential or substantial truth to the stings of the defamation imputations , ' he said			2
the post on the @entity29 mother - of - two 's page was seen by mr @entity9 's brother as well as a woman he started dating in 2012			1
it was not removed until february 2013			0
during the trial , ms @entity8 maintained she was did not know how to use @entity5 and had only started using it just months before the december 2012 post went up			2
she said the post was ' a complete fabrication and part of a malicious and vindictive campaign ' against her carried out by mr @entity9 and other people			2
the only reference ms @entity8 was able to produce as evidence of the violence and abuse she claims to have suffered was a 2010 incident			0
mr @entity9 later penned a letter to apologise to his wife for his ' freak out ' and ' spoiling the holiday '			2
the letter was presented as evidence during the trial and read : ' i do n't deal with my panic attacks well â€¦ the panic and freak out period i had re holidays just showed that '			0
but mr @entity9 told the court this referred to ' his internal state of mind ' but judge @entity15 said this defence ' lacked credibility '			1
@entity2 district court judge @entity15 said he had ' no doubt ' ms @entity8 's post had caused mr @entity9 ' personal distress , humiliation and hurt and harm to his reputation ' however , the judge said this did not mean he accepted ms @entity8 's version of events			1
he believed she had a ' propensity to say whatever advances her cause ' and was ' not a credible witness '			0
judge @entity15 said he had ' no doubt ' ms @entity8 's post had caused mr @entity9 ' personal distress , humiliation and hurt and harm to his reputation '			1
' it did cause people to " look at him twice " and be more reserved about their contact with him , ' the judge said			0
during the civil trial , a number of witnesses said the post had altered their perception of the school teacher to the point where they questioned their association with him and his behaviour			0
as he was handing down his ruling , judge @entity15 said content on social media had a way of spreading quickly and damages would be awarded to mr @entity9 ' as reparation for the harm done to his personal and business reputation and for vindication to his reputation '			1
' defamatory publications on social media spread easily by the simple manipulation of computers , ' he said			0
' a public @entity5 page is able to be viewed worldwide by whoever clicks on that page			0

@entity8 posted the defamatory remark on her @entity5 in 2012
it was seen by *multiple* people , *including* @entity119 's brother
@entity2 district court judge said he found *inconsistencies* in both cases
but judge @entity15 ruled in the estranged husband 's *favour*
he believed the post had caused mr @entity9 ' distress ' and ' harm '
