@entity5 , 31 , and his sibling @entity7 , 26 , used confidential information passed on from a bank ' insider ' to steal elderly and vulnerable people 's life savings from 218 accounts			1
the criminals spent most of the cash from the 12 - month scam on luxury holidays , cars and designer clothes , including @entity22 flip flops ' to the tune of £ 1,000 a pair ' , @entity14 heard			1
the brothers also went on shopping sprees at @entity27 and @entity28 as well as drinking champagne at nightclubs in @entity32 's @entity31			1
con artists : brothers @entity7 ( left ) @entity5 ( righted ) grabbed £ 244,000 in a fraud that raided the accounts of hundreds of vulnerable and elderly people victims had been conned after the fraudsters telephoned them pretending to be from their bank			1
after speaking on the phone and getting vital details such as a pin number , a taxi was sent to the victim ’s house to pick up the bank card and deliver it to the gang			2
as well as dressing in @entity50 clothes , @entity48 enjoyed two sunshine trips to @entity52 at his victims ' expense , booking an ocean - room at the @entity56 on one of his lavish breaks			2
judge @entity59 , @entity60 , said the brothers had not shown a ' morsel of remorse ' as he jailed them			2
the judge said they had resorted to making ' sinister threats ' to persuade their elderly victims , aged in their 80s and 90s , from @entity70 , north @entity32 , to hand over bank cards and details			1
judge @entity59 told them : ' you clearly had some access to private and confidential bank information , because the information with which you were armed to incite this conspiracy could only have come from the confidential files in a bank			0
' the conspiracy lasted for about 12 months , involving about 220 different cases and the loss in the region of a quarter of a million pounds was occasioned			0
' taken back : @entity5 's flash blue @entity87 is seized by police after they smashed their racket spending : the @entity5 brother splurged their cash on these designer goods and perfumes recovered from the bedroom they shared in a @entity32 council house spending : one of the men bought a pair of @entity22 flip - flops like these , ' to the tune of £ 1,000 ' , the court heard they used their parents ' council home in @entity108 as the nerve centre of their fraud			1
@entity5 even set up a bogus 0845 number at their house from which at least 218 victims were called by men posing as bank staff			1
the targets were conned into handing over vital details such as pin numbers to the fraudsters			0
a taxi was then sent to the victims ' homes to pick up the card and deliver it to the gang			0
the cards were then used to either siphon cash out of the person 's account or open up a loan			0
police launched a string of raids on july 5 last year to smash the complex crime ring after carrying out a huge investigation			2
misdeed : @entity48 also enjoyed two sunshine trips to @entity52 at his victims ' expense , booking an ocean - room at the @entity56 ( pictured ) detectives found confidential bank documents stashed behind the steering wheel of a flash £ 7,500 @entity87 belonging to former bus driver @entity5			1
the complex fraud of the type carried out by the @entity145 has been troubling police for some time			0
conmen posing as bank staff , fraud investigators or even police telephone their elderly and vulnerable targets , convince them that their bank accounts have been compromised and persuade , and sometimes threaten , the victims into handing over sensitive information such as their pin			2
a courier , often an unwitting minicab driver , is sent round to the victims address to collect the card before the fraudsters plunder the target 's bank accounts for thousands of pounds			2
more than 100 people in @entity70 , @entity32 , have been stung so far to the tune of £ 1million and the fraud is still continuing			1
a @entity168 actor and @entity171 artist 's bank accounts have been raided and former @entity173 @entity172 had £ 1,000 stolen from his account late last year			1

he was jailed for six years			1
his younger brother @entity189 was jailed for four years and three months after he admitted one count of conspiracy to commit fraud			2
the scam , known as ' courier fraud ' , is still rife in @entity70 , with more than 100 cases reported to police every week			0
det @entity198 @entity197 , based in @entity70 , said after the brothers were jailed : ' these men committed a calculated and ruthless series of frauds to fund their lavish lifestyle			0
' they had absolutely no regard for their victims , demonstrated by the fact that they not only took their victims ' lifesavings without batting an eyelid but then even taunted and verbally abused some of them			0
' these sentences reflect the importance we , the police , and the criminal justice system attach to this cold - hearted crime , and our determination to bring the callous perpetrators to account			0
' i urge the public to remember this simple rule " the banks and the police will never ask for your pin or bank card , so do not give it to them			0
' det insp @entity229 , of @entity231 's @entity230 , said : ' this is a great result for the @entity70 officers who were quite rightly commended for their work by the trial judge			0
' hopefully , these are just the first of many such results as we seek to curb this truly distasteful crime			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
