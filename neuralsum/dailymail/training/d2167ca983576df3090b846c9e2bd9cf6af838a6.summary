by @entity0 published : 03:51 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 21 february 2013 top judges have expressed concern that criminal illegal immigrants could be blocking mental hospital beds because laws stop them being being deported or released into the community			1
the @entity7 urged a ' speedy ' review of the rules on mental patients who are not entitled to be in the @entity11 after hearing from a top forensic psychiatrist that scarce beds that could be used by other patients are being needlessly occupied			1
dr @entity16 told the court in @entity18 it has ' proved very difficult ' to discharge patients like @entity20 following successful treatment , as they are not legally entitled to post-release support in the community			1
the @entity7 was told it has ' proved very difficult ' to discharge patients following successful treatment , as they are not legally entitled to post-release support in the community the doctor made his comments as three of the country 's most senior judges reconsidered the sentence handed to the killer who throttled his landlady , 21 - year - old @entity33 , as her baby son sat nearby			1
in light of the problems he described , dr @entity16 urged the @entity7 to make an order which would see @entity20 returned to prison - from where he could be deported - once his mental illness has been effectively treated			1
but , saying they could not allow flaws in the system to influence their decision , the judges ordered @entity20 's release to be decided on by medical professionals			2
lord justice @entity48 said : ' if dr @entity16 is right about this - and we have no reason to suppose he is not - it is indeed a most unhappy state of affairs and the authorities must look at it speedily			0
' but we can not allow it to play a part in deciding the proper disposal in this case			2
' the court heard @entity20 , now 25 , was lodging with ms @entity33 and her partner at their home in @entity64 , @entity65 , when he killed her in front of her 15 - month - old son in december 2006			2
@entity7 judges fear criminal illegal immigrants could be blocking a mental hospital beds indefinitely however , he was so ill that he was found unfit to enter a plea and it was not until july 2011 that he admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
he was handed imprisonment for public protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - and ordered to serve at least five years and three months behind bars , although that minimum term was later cut to three years and three months on appeal			0
the court heard medical experts were of the view he was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the killing and therefore his responsibility was significantly diminished			0
by the time he was finally jailed in 2011 , he had already served 15 months in custody on remand and three - and - a - half years in a secure hospital			0
the @entity7 overturned @entity20 's indefinite jail term and replaced it with a hospital order so that his release date will be fixed by clinicians , subject to the home secretary 's final decision , rather than the @entity99			1
lord justice @entity48 said he accepted dr @entity16 's comments regarding the difficulties around his discharge , which could see him remain in a hospital bed and may be ' damaging to the appellant and to the wider public '			2
however , the judge refused to make an order which would see him returned to prison following his treatment			0
sitting with mr @entity111 and judge @entity112 , he added : ' we think that , in light of the circumstances , we do not feel it appropriate to impose a prison sentence as a form of punishment			0
' even less would it be appropriate to impose imprisonment for public protection , when it seems to us that , given the incident was caused by his mental disorder , there is no justification for detaining him once the medical authorities determine he can be released			0
' this is a decision which , in our view , should be left to the medical authorities , rather than the @entity99			0

@entity7 urges review of rules on patients not entitled to be in @entity11
it follows case of man who throttled landlady , 21 , in front of her baby
judges were told it has ' proved very difficult ' to discharge him
