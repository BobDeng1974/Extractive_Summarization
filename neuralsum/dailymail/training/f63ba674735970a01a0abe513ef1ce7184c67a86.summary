@entity0 , the broadcasting watchdog , has launched an investigation into a @entity4 docudrama which led to more than 6,500 complaints after it depicted people rioting in the streets following an imagined @entity9 election win			1
the broadcaster has been accused of election bias and scaremongering after it painted a country marred by race riots and mass unemployment under an imagined leadership by @entity18 in ' @entity9 : the @entity19 '			1
the watchdog confirmed it has launched an investigation to determine whether rules on impartiality and offensive material have been broken following the airing of the programme on february 16			1
the @entity19 has become the most complained about one - off programme in @entity42 this year , sparking 5,262 complaints to the watchdog			1
a further 1,300 complaints were received by @entity4			1
a spokesman for the communications watchdog said : ' @entity0 has carefully assessed a number of complaints about @entity9 : the first 100 days on @entity4			1
' we are opening an investigation into the programme as it may raise issues under our rules on offensive material , misleadingness and due impartiality			1
we are also considering fairness and privacy complaints about the programme			0
' investigations usually take around 50 days , but because of the election in may , @entity0 is not likely to publish its conclusions until after may 7			1
often an investigation ends in a formal notification to a broadcaster , which is seen as a ' black mark ' against their name			1
but in more extreme and rarer circumstances , often when there has been a repeat of the breach @entity0 can make a sanction			2
this is frequently in the form of a fine			0
fictional mp @entity77 the party 's only @entity79 mp , is left grappling with a difficult situation in @entity82 race riots were shown to break out throughout the country three months after the imagined @entity9 victory @entity18 criticised the show after other people said they felt it was biased and scaremongering the programme was broadcast last week and has become the most complained about one - off this year the 5,262 objections to @entity9 : the @entity19 make the docu - drama one of the most complained about in @entity0 's history			1
here are a few shows which beat the tally			0
celebrity @entity95 race row : 44,500 comments made by @entity98 to @entity99 in 2007 attracted the most complaints in the regulator 's history and forced @entity4 to issue a public apology			1
@entity104 : 8,860 the stage satire prompted outrage in 2005 after a tv version aired on the @entity108 , showing the chat show host in the bowels of hell and a troupe of dancing @entity114 members			0

the @entity4 docudrama lasted one hour and was watched by more than 1million people			2
it depicted rioting on the streets in the wake of a slim @entity9 general election victory in may and combined archive footage with imagined scenes			2
it shows the country teetering on the edge of destruction just three months after @entity9 are elected			2

the @entity4 show featured actress @entity159 playing the part of the party 's only @entity79 woman @entity163			1

the programme - which depicted riots between protesters for and against tough anti-immigration raids - was strongly condemned by party leader mr @entity18			0
' look like 100 days of @entity9 may well have backfired on @entity4			1
a biased , partisan depiction of the only party that believes in @entity42 , ' he wrote on his @entity178 feed			0
following confirmation that @entity0 would investigate the broadcaster a spokesman for @entity9 said : a spokesman said , ' @entity9 are not going to comment about the programme as we did not make a complaint , though we understand why others might have wished to do so			1
' audiences branded the show a ' hatchet job ' as a number voiced their criticisms on @entity178 , including comedian @entity192 who raised concerns about bias			2
one viewer said : ' this is so biased from a mainstream media [ organisation ] , it makes me furious - and i don ´ t even support @entity9			2
' mr @entity18 tweeted after the programme that it appeared the show ' may well have backfired on @entity4 ' the film combined acted scenes with actual news footage and showed race riots breaking out in @entity42 another wrote : ' i 'm no @entity9 fan , but this hatchet job @entity4 is doing on them is quite anti-democratic and quite outrageous			1
' @entity4 has said ' a lot of research ' went into the docudrama and that mr @entity18 had been invited to watch it before it was broadcast and then to do an interview afterwards but he declined			2
the broadcaster said it ordered the drama - which criticised @entity9 , its leaders and its supporters - as a way of engaging people in politics in the run - up to the may general election			1
@entity4 's head of documentaries @entity226 defended the controversial drama , saying it was fair and timing was not an issue			0
he said : ' our job is to reflect and explore contemporary @entity42 life			0
nothing represents what 's different and unique in @entity42 political life now more than the rise of @entity9			0
' this might be what you wake up to after may 7			0
' anger : the documentary featured a ' far - right ' demonstration in which the only banner was @entity247 's flag one scene that raised hackles was a far - right protest where the only visible banner was the flag of @entity247			0
@entity253 , digital managing editor of political magazine @entity254 , wrote : ' did @entity4 just show the flag of @entity247 to suggest a group of protesters are from the ' far right ' ? ! ' one @entity178 user , @entity257 , wrote : ' you had to show an @entity247 flag in the fascist demonstration			2
the criticism added to complaints that the documentary had used broad sweeping generalisations about the ideas of political left and right			0
though one user , @entity268 , wrote : ' i 've been to @entity271 counter-protests before and seen @entity271 supporters flying @entity247 's flag			0
' and it was later said the footage was in fact archive material from a real far - right protest in @entity278 last year			0
