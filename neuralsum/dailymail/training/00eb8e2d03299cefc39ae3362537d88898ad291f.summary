a new study has discovered that women walk two miles over a three hour period during twice weekly shopping trips			1
over a year , that equates to walking 208 miles and burning off 14,844 calories , or 67 bars of chocolate			1
finally an excuse ! over a lifetime we walk 12,000 miles just by hitting the stores , which is more than the distance from @entity21 to @entity22 during a lifetime , shoppers can expect to walk over 12,000 miles which is a little more than walking from @entity21 to @entity22 ( 10,557miles ) as the crow flies			1
the study was carried out with a group of shoppers who were asked to wear a pedometer when out shopping over a four week period to measure the distance they walked			0
small trips to buy everyday essentials were not included in the study which instead focused on the weekly supermarket shop and visits to shopping centres , the high street and city centre retailers			2
one of those who took part commented : ' i love to shop and can easily waste hours pottering around stores over the weekend			2
the shopping workout : shopping burns off 14,844 calories each year ' while i ’m out i do n’t give a lot of thought to how far i ’ve walked , but by the time i get home my feet are killing me so i know i ’ve gone some distance			1
' another added : ' i can easily walk from one end of town to the other a couple of times during a shopping trip			2
i always end up buying the first thing i saw which is inevitably at the opposite end of town to where i end up ! ' a female shopper said : ' it never crossed my mind i was exercising while out shopping – it ’s certainly more fun than going to the gym			0
there ’s the walking which is great cardio exercise , stretching by picking things off high shelves and racks , and a work out for the arms carrying all those heavy bags of goodies home			0
' a spokesperson for @entity75 , who conducted the study , said : ' most of us see popping to the shops as a leisurely pastime			0
however , over a three hour shopping trip you can easily cover off a couple of miles , more if you ’re striding out from one end of town to the other , so you get a bit of a workout as well as indulging yourself			0
' i think most of us would agree a trip to the shops beats the gym every time			0
