this latest funding brings the total investment in the firm to $ 123m			1

according to sources , mr @entity33 thinks the app ’s user numbers have lots of potential to grow and just two months ago , the company ’s usage had reportedly risen dramatically to 350 million messages a day , from 200 million in june			1

the social network reportedly tried to acquire @entity3 last year for $ 1 billion but raised its offer to $ 3 billion , which , if it was accepted , would be @entity30 ’s largest acquisition to date			1

while @entity56 - based @entity3 has no sales of business model , its smartphone app delivers millions of messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds , making it a truly instant service @entity172 , principal analyst at @entity171 believes this could include more personalised narrative content instead of banner adverts			0
‘ if you can create content , whether it is a photo or a video or a story , and get it onto one of these instant messaging apps , it has the potential to go viral so fast because the community of users is so big , ’ she said			0
while the app might have the potential to generate revenue from advertising , some analysts believe @entity3 runs the risk of becoming one of many similar services			0

‘ there are going to be a dozen companies that look something like this , and @entity30 ca n't buy them all , ’ he said			1
