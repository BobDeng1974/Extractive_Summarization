this is the moment a leaping spider that has menaced a family for five years was dramatically lured from its hole to catch a fake fly			1
the @entity6 family recorded the moment they confronted the green - fanged creature , which they say has been living in a hole behind their garage wall in @entity14 , @entity15 , since 2009			1
father - of - three @entity16 , 27 , is convinced the same spider - which he says is a @entity19 , more commonly known as a tube web spider - has been lurking above the door frame ever since			1
the family initially tried to provoke the spider with a stick			0
but when the plan failed , their four - year - old son @entity47 up with a better idea			0
he suggested to his parents that they could use one of his toys - which has a fake fly attached to a stick - to poke the spider 's hole			1
in the footage , the spider is seen charging out of its nest in a bid to snare the pretend insect , as mr @entity6 's father prods the hole			1
but , within a split - second , the speedy spider has scurried back up the wall and retreated back into its nest			1
mr @entity6 , a precision engineer , said : ' we first noticed the spider about five years ago			1
i 'm sure its the same one			0
the spider - dubbed ' mr @entity73 ' by the @entity6 children - scurried back up the wall and retreated back into its nest ' there are tonnes of spiders living in the garage but most of them are just average - this one has a really menacing look to it			1
' he lives in a little hole which is on the doorframe walking into the garage but comes out to peer down at his web			2
' my dad used the fly puppet to gently touch the web and the spider hurtled out			2
he moved really fast - before you knew it he was right back in his hole			2
' mr @entity6 and his three children - @entity47 , four , @entity100 , three and @entity101 , two - call the spider ' mr @entity104 ' because of its size			1
the @entity6 family , pictured , say they are sure it is the same spider because it has a really ' menacing look ' mr @entity6 , a precision engineer , first spotted the spider living in a hole behind their garage wall in @entity14 , @entity15 , in 2009 mr @entity6 said it lives in a little hole ( left ) which is on the door frame ( right ) walking into the garage - but comes out to peer down at his web they had previously tried to lure the creature using a normal stick , but did not have any luck			1
tube - web spiders are one of the largest spiders in @entity128 and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches , moths , bees and wasps			2
they sow distinctive tube - shaped webs in cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands			2
they first entered the @entity143 150 years ago from continental @entity128 , arriving on ships docking in ports			0
the females tend to be larger than males and can reach a body length of up to 22mm			0
if left undisturbed , domestic house spiders can live as long as seven years in the same web in places like attics , basements , and garages			0
one of the tube web spiders that have invaded the outside walls and garden of mr @entity160 's home @entity19 is the largest @entity128 spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm			1
originally from the @entity165 , they can be found as far east as @entity166 but are also commonly spotted in @entity143 - particularly in the later half of the year			2
they have a black or dark brown body , often with a green shine on their fangs			0
while their bite has no long lasting effects , it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours			0
they are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it			1
sightings of the spider in @entity143 have in the past been confused with the deadly @entity192 funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique			1
@entity195 , a naturalist and former @entity197 radio presenter , said the tube web spider might look scary but says it ’s not dangerous to humans			1
he said : ‘ it bites in defence so if you pick one up , or it gets caught in your clothing , you are likely to be nipped			0
but no @entity143 spider delivers a fatal bite or even one dangerous to humans			0
‘ it seems this spider was accidentally introduced into @entity143 from its native @entity165 and @entity210			0
‘ it sits at the mouth of its tunnel in old brickwork or behind loose bark or any other suitable hole , waiting for a hapless insect to stumble across the spokes - tripwires that alert the spider to its victim			2
‘ once detected , the spider moves like lightning			0
i defy anybody not to jump when this happens as it is such a surprise even if you are expecting it			0
‘ the prey is dragged back into the narrow tube and eventually the spider ’s venom overcomes the prey			2
’ @entity234 , from the @entity235 at the @entity236 , said : ‘ they can fall , or plunge if they are on a wall , but you would n’t really describe it as jumping			0
' equally if you came across a male out of his silk tube and provoked him by poking him he could probably just about raise a hop , but they are certainly not considered jumping spiders			0
