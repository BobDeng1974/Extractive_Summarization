detectives working to find missing @entity1 have given their counterparts in @entity3 a new list of potential suspects and have urged them to investigate them more than 20 new suspects in the @entity1 investigation have been identified by @entity9 police			1
a @entity12 review of the bungled @entity3 inquiry into the three - year - old ’s disappearance in 2007 has uncovered dozens of fresh leads , it emerged yesterday			1
they include ‘ forensic opportunities ’ and several ‘ people of interest ’ , including @entity9 , who have not been eliminated from the case			0
@entity24 ’s parents , @entity25 and @entity26 , are said to be ‘ greatly encouraged ’ by the developments			1
but the @entity28 has learned that behind the scenes , a major diplomatic row is brewing because the @entity3 authorities are adamant they will not reopen the inquiry			2
officials in @entity34 have told their @entity9 counterparts that under @entity3 laws , they can reopen the case only if there is new evidence			1
but @entity12 chiefs – who want the @entity3 to agree to a joint investigation – say their new leads could , if properly explored , result in new evidence and possibly the @entity44 mystery being solved			2
one well - placed source described the deadlock as ‘ a @entity48 stand - off ’			0
‘ it ’s a chicken - and - egg situation			0
significant new evidence can be found if the leads uncovered by the @entity12 are investigated			0
there are two major obstacles to a joint investigation : the money to fund it in @entity3 and the loss of face they would suffer from having to agree to such an inquiry			2
’ it is understood high - level discussions have taken place in the @entity9 about the possibility of @entity12 launching its own investigation			0
@entity9 police do not have jurisdiction in @entity3 , but they have the right to investigate and prosecute any @entity9 suspects linked to @entity24 ’s disappearance			1
still hopeful : mrs @entity70 returned to @entity3 this month with her mother , @entity71 , six years on this picture shows @entity25 and @entity26 marking the fifth anniversary of their daughter 's disappearance with an ' aged ' photo of how she might look - on the sixth anniversary this year they said they 'd not given up should the @entity82 decide to launch its own investigation , it is likely to send a formal letter of request to the @entity3 authorities – seeking its assistance in its inquiries			1
last night a @entity12 spokesman confirmed a high - level delegation of officers travelled to @entity3 in march , but he refused to comment on what discussions took place			2
the senior detective who has overseen the @entity82 ’s two - year review of the case yesterday confirmed his officers had drawn up a list of people who they say are ‘ of interest ’			1
detective chief superintendent @entity100 , the head of @entity12 ’s @entity101 , said there were a ‘ good number ’ of individuals who should be questioned			1
he would not disclose the precise number but sources told the @entity28 that at least 20 potential suspects – including a number of @entity9 who were in the @entity110 at the time of @entity24 ’s disappearance six years ago – had not been properly eliminated			1
mr @entity100 urged the @entity3 authorities to investigate the new leads			1
he said : ‘ there are a lot of people of interest			0
there are people who could be properly explored further , if only to be eliminated			0
’ @entity24 went missing from her family ’s holiday apartment in @entity122 in @entity3 in 2007 as her parents dined with friends nearby			1
the shambolic @entity3 inquiry was shelved in 2008 but @entity12 launched a @entity127 - funded review of the case in 2011 following the intervention of @entity130			2
last year the officer in day - to - day charge of the review , detective chief inspector @entity131 , said his team had identified 195 potential leads after examining a huge bundle of material			2
mr @entity100 said it was ‘ perfectly probable ’ that information which could identify the suspect responsible for @entity24 ’s disappearance was already in the @entity3 files			1
he reiterated a claim that @entity24 could still be alive			0
he said : ‘ you only have to look at the case in @entity147 , @entity148 , and the @entity150 cases			0
of course there is a possibility she is alive			0
‘ but the key is to investigate the case and , alive or dead , we should be able to try and discern what happened			0
’ the @entity157 , of @entity158 , @entity159 , have been kept closely informed of @entity12 ’s review – codenamed @entity161 – over the past two years			0
a spokesman for the couple said : ‘ they have been encouraged from the moment the review started and are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry			2
’ a source close to the couple said : ‘ while they do n’t want to raise their hopes too much , they are buoyed up by these revelations			0
’ a @entity127 source said : ‘ clearly not all the 20 potential suspects identified by the @entity82 could be responsible for @entity24 ’s disappearance			1
but the @entity12 are adamant that if they were running the inquiry here , these people would have been properly eliminated			0
’ the @entity184 resort in @entity122 in the @entity110 from where @entity1 was abducted in may 2007 @entity1 as she looked when she went missing , left , and how she would look now , right @entity186 , who retired today as head of the @entity82 's @entity101 , urged @entity3 police to act on the new list of potential suspects in the @entity1 case			1

@entity82 police have named ' a good number ' of potential suspects to speak to
@entity197 @entity100 says his officers have done ' *fantastic* ' case review
he urged his @entity3 counterparts to investigate their fresh leads
@entity25 and @entity26 are ' very , very *pleased* ' about the new list of names
@entity24 went missing in may 2007 during a family holiday in @entity122
