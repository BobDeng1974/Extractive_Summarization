@entity64 crocodile researcher @entity63 said although it was an obvious shame that the well - loved crocodile had to be shot - it was the appropriate action to take			2

the third fatal crocodile attack this year in the @entity81 has prompted the government to consider crocodile culling , safari hunting and a renewed safety campaign the man was standing on the bank of the river east of @entity44 trying to retrieve a fishing hook when he was taken by the crocodile			1
signs near where the man was attacked show warnings about fishing near crocodiles dr @entity63 said territorians are becoming complacent , and deaths are not the way people should be reminded about crocodile safety			2
' this man almost certainly would have known there were crocodiles in the river , and he probably even knew the croc that took him , ' he said			2

' the @entity34 is well known for its jumping croc tours , where boats travel the river and crocodiles jump for meat attached to hooks			1
