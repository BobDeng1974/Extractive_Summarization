a bead of sweat drips down the side of @entity4 's face			1
for 70 minutes of this clash he 's had his ankles kicked and hacked at by @entity8			0
but now there 's a gap he can run into			0
@entity12 spots his ghost - like movement and fires a low ball towards the space			0
with a dip of one shoulder @entity4 leaves @entity19 for dead and now he can see the whites of @entity23 's eyes			1
he pulls the trigger and the ball beats the goalkeeper , arrowing towards the far post			0
99,000 people at the @entity28 hold their breath			1
millions more are frozen , transfixed , eyes glued to their tv sets			0
the biggest game in world football has just got bigger			1
when @entity36 play @entity37 , the planet stands still			1
they are always superlative affairs , featuring the sport 's finest players			0
tests not only of physical and technical ability , but also tremendous mental strength			0
and amid the galaxy of stars that will be on display , one of football 's brightest has been plucked from the @entity49 and neatly placed into a vacant position on the right - hand side of @entity37 's attack			1
legends : @entity37 versus @entity36 is traditionally the biggest game in world football raising the stakes : @entity4 's arrival at @entity37 means that the @entity57 will be even bigger next season trident : @entity4 is likely to line up alongside @entity12 and @entity60 in a fearsome three - pronged attack @entity4 's move from @entity63 to @entity37 has long been in the pipeline , but only now it has been officially declared does the terrifying reality of what it means in footballing terms become clear			1
@entity4 will fit in alongside @entity12 and @entity60 in what could prove to be the finest front - line in football history			1
except , in the @entity74 capital , @entity4 's acquisition is only viewed as the latest aggressive step in a never - ending arms race			1
@entity36 are closing in on the signing of @entity78 , @entity80 's @entity79 star			1
he has spent the last few months recovering from a knee - injury , but when fit he is arguably the most lethal striker in the game			1
@entity84 : @entity36 want to add @entity80 striker @entity78 to their attack in time for next season the end : @entity78 's arrival could force @entity89 to leave the @entity90 in search of first - team football anything you can do : @entity95 and @entity96 make up two parts of @entity36 's attacking options while @entity89 's overall game has improved under @entity100 , he does n't offer the brutal and clinical edge that @entity78 wields with such impunity			1
as well as @entity78 , @entity36 are close to adding @entity105 midfield diamond @entity103 to their armoury , which is already bursting at the seams			1
when @entity37 play @entity36 for the first time in the coming season , you will be able to construct a side from the two benches that would be able to challenge for the title itself			1
@entity74 league fixture scheduling is stacked			0
@entity116 rarely take place too early in the season , because @entity119 want the game to have some significance with regards to the standings in the table			2
and , with @entity4 banned for four months , we may be holding our breath for a @entity57 until the end of october			1
as @entity119 's star signing this summer , the idea that @entity37 will be allowed to play @entity36 without him is almost ludicrous			1
so when the two teams meet , the players will have had time to get up to speed			0
these are the two sides that could be facing each other at the @entity28 , or @entity137			2
@entity138 : @entity139 and @entity105 midfielder @entity103 is wanted by @entity36 tough task : @entity141 is the man charged with returning @entity37 to the top instant success : @entity100 won the @entity144 in his first season at @entity36 @entity146 : @entity147 is likely to return to a midfield role for @entity37 next season the match is a mouthwatering proposition			1
@entity141 has already suggested that @entity147 will be moved from defence into midfield			0
given his fantastic performances in @entity156 there at this @entity157 , it would be no surprise if he follows through with this plan			0
that would pit him up against @entity103 , the man he will be trying shackle on sunday night in the @entity157 final			2
however , even if that battle could dictate the ebb and flow of the game , all eyes will be on the two diamond - encrusted attacks			2
despite @entity12 and @entity95 being the sole @entity170 victors for the past few years , it is @entity4 who will be in the spotlight , the first time these two teams meet			2
formidable : @entity174 and @entity8 are @entity36 's defensive partnership no nonsense : they bring a physical approach to defending bring it on : @entity4 's battle with @entity19 and @entity8 is likely to be a full - blooded one with little room for shirking @entity8 and @entity19 are provocative defenders , who love nothing more than getting stuck into their opponents			1
just look at their treatment of @entity189 last season			0
and as fiery as the now - @entity193 striker is , @entity4 resides on a different level of snark			1
it would be no surprise if @entity37 insisted the @entity198 undertake a psychology course before the game , to ensure the red mist that has plagued him does n't descend again			1
in the heat of the action , @entity4 has bitten three opponents			2
he has racially abused another			0
when he was 15 he was accused of headbutting a referee			0
neither the referee , @entity207 , @entity208 or @entity209 have a patch on @entity8 when it comes to getting under a rival 's skin			0
speaking in pure footballing terms , @entity4 has the beating of @entity36 's defence			1
but , as we know , @entity116 are rarely just about who is better with the ball at their feet			0
@entity60 will be hungry to prove himself after his @entity157 campaign was ended early by @entity225 's brutal challenge			0
@entity95 too , after his summer barely even began because of injury			2
@entity95 will turn 30 this season and it could be his last at the top of his game			2
he will make it count			0
@entity96 is eager to build on his last - gasp @entity232 winning wonder - goal against @entity37			2
last season @entity96 found it hard to make an impact in the biggest games , but ended up scoring that goal at the @entity238 , as well as crucially nodding home against @entity240 in the @entity144 final			2
@entity96 will now be expected to do more in these matches , as well as continuing to produce decisive moments			0
we were given an incredible @entity57 at the @entity90 in march , with @entity12 scoring a hat - trick as @entity37 won 4 - 3			2
if the defences could n't control the forwards back then , how can they cope with @entity4 and @entity78 thrown into the mix ? when @entity37 and @entity36 take to the field next season , we could well be watching the six best attacking players in the world go at it hammer and tongs			1
injuries - and suspension - apart			0
and it 's impossible to decide who will win - apart from anybody lucky enough to get a ticket			0
making his mark : @entity96 scored 15 goals and assisted 12 in his first season in @entity119 the best : last season @entity12 scored 28 goals in 29 @entity119 games and set up a further 11 improvement needed : @entity60 scored nine goals and assisted eight during his first season in @entity119 prolific : last season @entity95 scored 31 goals in 31 @entity119 games and set up a further nine for his team - mates			0
