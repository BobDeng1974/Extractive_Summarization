there have been 3d - printed buildings , dresses , hats , jewellery and even parts of the anatomy			0
and now the world has been introduced to @entity8 , a 3d - printed car which was created using direct digital manufacturing techniques			1
the car is composed of 40 parts - a significantly smaller number than that of a conventional vehicle which has more than 20,000 components			2
the @entity17 is made of only 40 parts , unlike conventional vehicles which have more than 20,000 components conceived of by the @entity23 - based @entity22 , the printing and assembly process took 44 hours to complete and took place during the six - day @entity25 2014 in @entity26			1
made of one solid piece , the @entity17 will have a top speed of 40mph and a battery range of between 120 to 150 miles			2
the chassis and the body of the car are printed using a giant 3d printer but the tires , seats , wheels , battery , wiring , suspension , electric motor and window shield were made using conventional methods			1
local @entity22 hopes to offer 3d - printed cars for sale for between £ 11,000 to £ 18,000 ( $ 18k to $ 30k ) each the car was made using a giant 3d printer which can process parts as large as 3ft by 5ft by 10ft the battery - powered , two - passenger car is made of layers of black plastic and reinforced with carbon fiber			1
local @entity22 ceo @entity52 told the @entity53 : ' we are the first company to make a 3d - printed car using carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic			1
' the seats , body , chassis , dash , center console and hood will all be 3d printed			0
' experts hope the less expensive manufacturing process will bring innovations to the market more swiftly the company hopes to offer 3d - printed cars for between £ 11,000 to £ 18,000 ( $ 18,000 to $ 30,000 ) each , depending on the types of optional features buyers will want			2
a machine tool maker , @entity73 , supplied the huge printer , much larger than the usual 3d printers , which are usually 10ins by 10ins			0
this particular printer is able to process parts as large as 3ft by 5ft by 10ft			0
local @entity22 wants to launch ' 3d printed vehicles that will be available to the general public ' local @entity22 has been producing motorcycles , motorised skateboards and other vehicles since 2007 , using the same method			0
mr @entity52 hopes that this less expensive manufacturing process will bring innovations to the market more swiftly than the usual methods of production			0
on their website , @entity22 says that it is planning to launch ' production - level @entity90 printed vehicles that will be available to the general public for purchase in the months following the show ' .			1

@entity8 was conceived of by @entity23 - based innovators @entity22
created on a giant printer using digital manufacturing techniques
the battery - powered , two - passenger car is made from carbon fiber
