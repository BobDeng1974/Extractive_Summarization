by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:08 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 15:32 est , 27 september 2013 house speaker @entity2 has been pushing a hard line on a stalemate in order to win a one - year delay on @entity7 , an aide to one of his colleagues told @entity11 exclusively @entity12 in the @entity13 have been demanding a complete defunding of the @entity7 law in order to set up the @entity17 for a one - year implementation delay and a 2014 electoral showdown , an aide to a senior @entity12 congressman has told @entity11			1
the @entity22 passed its first major procedural hurdle with ease on friday , with a 79 - 19 vote to end debate , in which more than half of @entity12 joined with @entity28			1
two more votes , both strictly along party lines , amended a @entity13 budget resolution to strip language defunding @entity7 , and then to approve the resolution itself			1
the @entity12 's political calculations are clear : forcing @entity28 to delay the @entity7 's enforcement for 12 months would shift the current national anxieties about health insurance to this time next year – just weeks before the crucial 2014 congressional elections			1
' look , ' said the @entity13 aide , speaking on condition of anonymity , ' you have to understand that we 've been working for the delay from the beginning			2
there 's no way the @entity17 was going to agree to killing the funding , but if we led with a demand for a one - year " time out , " we could n't have gotten that			1
' ' it 's like every negotiation in business , in politics , in sports salary arbitration : you make an unreasonable demand because you really want something more reasonable			2
' ' this is what the conference meetings have really been about			0
' senate majority leader @entity65 called a 12:30 p.m. vote on an amendment to the @entity13 's budget resolution , stripping the language that killed funding for the president 's national health insurance overhaul			1
@entity28 easily passed their first a procedural hurdle , collecting 79 votes for a motion to close debate on the measure			2
no negotiations : @entity17 press secretary @entity80 and president @entity81 have both said that they 're unwilling to bend on @entity7 's funding , but the @entity12 is banking on a middle ground @entity22 majority leader @entity65 ( @entity84 ) and senator @entity85 are raising fears about a government shutdown that would n't affect the military , social security , or other essential services now that the @entity22 resolution has officially passed , the @entity13 will have the ball in its court with precious few days left to act until the oct. 1 beginning of the government 's next fiscal year			1
that 's when negotiations will start			0
@entity17 communications director @entity98 compared @entity12 to mobsters and arsonists , insisting that holding the budget ' hostage ' wo n't meet with success house speaker @entity2 told reporters after a @entity106 meeting on thursday that his chamber wo n't vote on the bill again if the @entity22 sends it back with the @entity7 funding restored			1
and , he said , a short - term spending resolution that takes the health care issue temporarily off the table also is n't in the cards			2
' i do not see that happening , ' @entity2 said			0
@entity13 majority leader @entity116 insisted , meanwhile , that @entity28 should be willing to negotiation , and perhaps meet the @entity12 halfway			1
' we call on the president to sit down with us – @entity65 to sit down with us – and let ’s resolve this problem , ' he said			0
republicans , said the @entity125 aide who spoke with @entity11 , will try to convince the @entity81 administration that a one - year delay is in everyone 's interests since it would give the @entity17 time to work out the kinks in @entity7 's implementation			1
but the @entity12 would also gain political leverage , denying @entity81 's team the change to fix those problems in time to demonstrate to a wary public before the 2014 midterm elections that all is well			2
@entity12 ' short - term leverage is the threat of a government shutdown if a budget deal is n't reached by midnight as monday turns to tuesday			1
but the @entity17 has projected a defiant image , sending advisers out to insist that there will be no room for a bargain			0
@entity98 , the @entity17 communications director , told @entity150 's @entity149 on thursday that the administration is not in favor of ' negotiating with people with a bomb strapped to their chest			0
we 're not going to do that			0
' ' republicans are not asking for a negotiation , " he said			0
' it 's a negotiation if i 'm trying to sell you my house , and we are debating the price of it			0
it 's not a negotiation if i show up at your house and say , " give me everything inside or i 'm going to burn it down			0
" ' sen. @entity171 claimed that ' we are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now , every bit as dangerous as the break - up of the @entity177 before the @entity178 ' a tea party - led backlash against @entity7 's encroachment on freedom of choice in the health care marketplace has catapulted @entity81 's signature legislative achievement back into the headlines spokespersons for the @entity17 and @entity13 speaker @entity2 did not respond to requests for comment			1
but @entity81 hinted on sept. 24 during a @entity28 fundraiser in @entity191 that the 2014 elections are a critical piece of the puzzle for a @entity17 that misses the monopoly it held in 2009 and 2010 when @entity28 controlled the @entity13			2
@entity81 told party faithful that he is ' going to be working as hard as i can to make sure that we have a @entity199 that is able in my last two years as president to get as much done as we got done in our first two years			0
' @entity202 @entity28 sen. @entity171 complained friday morning on the @entity22 floor that tea party - linked @entity12 have turned @entity199 into an unusually acrimonious bunch , blaming ' a small group of willful men and women who have a certain ideology			1
' ' since they ca n't get their way , they 're going to create this confusion and discourse , ' he said , ' and hope that the public will be so mixed up in who is to blame for this , that they 'll blame both sides			2
' ' it 's very dangerous , ' @entity171 insisted			0
' i believe ... we are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now			0
every bit as dangerous as the break - up of the @entity177 before the @entity178			0

the @entity22 passed a ' *cloture* ' motion and then approved a single amendment to a @entity13 budget resolution along strict party lines , fending off tea *partiers* who sought to defund @entity7
the @entity13 will now have a ' clean ' funding bill to consider , hoping that it wo n't be the one *kneeling* on the *football* when the clock expires
the government faces a partial shutdown monday at midnight if @entity28 and @entity12 ca n't agree on a budget ' *continuing* resolution '
a @entity13 source says the game ' from the beginning ' has been to angle for a one - year delay in @entity7 's implementation
moving everything back 12 months will force @entity28 to defend the health caer law leading up to the next congressional elections
several @entity12 senators who face *re-election* in 2014 joined @entity28 to vote for a measure moving the @entity28 ' preferred approach forward
