from @entity1 and @entity2 sitting on the @entity4 sofa to @entity5 doing a @entity6 in @entity7 , these are some of the best memes posted in reference to the leaders ’ debate			1
other images show @entity14 leader @entity13 posing with a rather sceptical face , and mr @entity5 superimposed over @entity18 rapper @entity16 , issuing a call to ‘ come at me bruv ’			1
this is thought to reference how the @entity22 leader posed a direct message to the prime minister , saying : ' @entity1 , if you think this election is about leadership , then debate me one - on - one			0
' @entity22 leader : mr @entity5 is superimposed over @entity18 rapper @entity16 , issuing a call to ' come at me bruv ' watching at home : prime minister @entity1 and his deputy @entity2 were superimposed over @entity34 and @entity35 , two men from @entity37 who appear on @entity39 series @entity4 alluring pose ? mr @entity5 was accompanied in one photo by the caption ' debate me like one of your @entity45 girls ' - a reference to when @entity48 asks @entity49 in the 1997 film @entity7 to ' draw me like one of your @entity45 girls ' ' fight me , b * * * * ' : the @entity22 leader posed a direct message to the prime minister , saying : ' @entity1 , if you think this election is about leadership , then debate me one - on - one ' odd one out : the five party leaders who took part in the debate were put in the places of the @entity63 in another image - although mr @entity65 was hidden behind the @entity66 , @entity67 the images were inspired by a debate that saw mr @entity5 warned he would not get into power without lurching left , as miss @entity13 told him he is ‘ not strong enough ’ to win power on his own			1
he took a high - risk choice to appear with the @entity14 leader , @entity74 's @entity65 , @entity76 leader @entity75 and @entity78 's @entity77 - but @entity1 and @entity2 stayed away			2
the prime minister and his deputy were therefore superimposed over @entity34 and @entity35 , two men from @entity37 who commentate on tv in the @entity39 series @entity4			0
' did ye , aye ? ' : @entity14 leader @entity13 poses with a sceptical face in this meme gone missing : this mock - up of mr @entity1 and mr @entity2 - superimposed on a clip from 2014 film @entity89 was among the images posted under the hashtag # @entity92 @entity93 : it was also suggested that mr @entity1 and mr @entity2 could be partying with stockbrokers preparing for battle : mr @entity5 pictured as @entity97 in the famous meat - punching scene from the 1976 film on his own : four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but mr @entity65 ( right ) was left alone debate participants : ( from left ) @entity22 leader @entity107 , @entity108 leader @entity77 , @entity110 leader @entity75 , @entity14 leader @entity13 and @entity74 's @entity65 and the five party leaders who did take part were put in the places of the @entity63 in another image - although mr @entity65 was hidden behind the @entity66 , @entity67			2
this was after the @entity74 leader referred to a ' total lack of comprehension on this panel ' , and was shunned by most of the other politicians at the end of the debate , who did not shake hands with him			0
meanwhile mr @entity5 was captioned with the phrase ‘ debate me like one of your @entity45 girls ’ - a reference to when @entity48 asks @entity49 in the 1997 film @entity7 to ‘ draw me like one of your @entity45 girls ’ .			0
