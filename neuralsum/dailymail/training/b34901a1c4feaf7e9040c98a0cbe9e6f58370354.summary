so , @entity1 ’s plan was to wipe the floor with @entity3 before next week ’s second leg in @entity5			1
if only this @entity7 lark was so easy			0
working out what to do next in the @entity9 , against a team sitting fourth in @entity11 , is part of @entity1 ’s coaching education			1
@entity15 ’s manager learned some valuable lessons here			1
it is a cardinal sin to concede at home in the first leg of @entity7 knockout football and @entity15 must score in @entity21 now to stand any chance of progressing to the round of 16			1
@entity24 , left , opened the scoring for @entity15 with a stunning volley to give @entity15 an early lead against @entity3 @entity15 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity28 6 ; @entity29 6 , @entity30 6 , @entity31 6.5 , @entity32 6 ; @entity33 6 , @entity34 6.5 ( @entity35 84min ) ; @entity36 7 ( @entity37 65 , 6 ) , @entity38 6 , @entity39 7.5 ( @entity40 72 , 5.5 ) ; @entity24 7			1
subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity35			0
@entity3 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity46 7 ; @entity47 5.5 , @entity48 4.5 , @entity49 6.5 ; @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 7 , @entity53 6.5 ( @entity54 78 ) , @entity55 5 ( @entity56 65 ) ; @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6.5			2
subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64			0
booked : @entity48 , @entity47			0
man of the match : @entity67			0
referee : @entity69 ( @entity70 )			0
ratings by @entity73 - @entity72 @entity1 needs a strategy because his side will play in three competitions — @entity77 , @entity9 and @entity78 — in an eight - day period			1
each has its own selling point			0
buying into the idea that @entity15 can win all three seems unwise because they allowed @entity3 back into this first leg at @entity84 following @entity24 ’s dreamy opener			1
little wonder @entity3 coach @entity86 thanked his coaching staff at the final whistle			0
the @entity90 are the only football nation who seem to prefer draws to wins			0
@entity7 football is a different discipline , requiring tactical nous and improvisation , adjusting to the needs and demands of the tie as the clock runs down			2
what a shame for @entity15 , because until @entity104 ’s cruel , 36th - minute equaliser , they had been much the better team			1
even without @entity37 , strangely left on the substitutes ’ bench after a nine - day rest since his last outing against @entity110 , they played with conviction in the first half			1
‘ they played a high - tempo pressing game as we expected , but they could not keep it up , ’ said @entity86 , justifiably			2
it was still a joy to watch @entity24 get on the scoresheet with just over five minutes gone , steering his volley beyond @entity121 direct from @entity34 ’s corner			1
he puffed out his chest after that , finding the encouragement he needed to attempt an outrageous overhead kick from @entity38 ’s 18th - minute cross			2
@entity15 striker @entity24 ( right ) has scored 10 of his last 11 goals at @entity84 @entity24 and team - mate @entity129 show their delight after securing an early lead against @entity3 @entity3 defender @entity104 scored the equaliser in the 36th minute against @entity15 @entity104 stabbed the ball home after goalkeeper @entity28 failed to deal with @entity137 ' fierce free kick @entity15 ’s energy was infectious , with @entity67 like a @entity140 bunny as he shuttled up and down the right wing			1
everyone is plugged into @entity1 ’s ideas			2
@entity67 ’s cushioned back - flick into the path of @entity34 , haring down the line at the midway point of the first half , was delicious			1
eventually townsend tired , and was replaced by @entity40 late in the second half when his legs could no longer give him the advantage over left back @entity55			0
by then @entity3 had the upper hand , closing this first leg down in a way only an @entity90 team can			0
they are masters at this stuff			0
@entity3 ’s goal punished @entity24 ’s reckless foul , for which he was inevitably booked , on the edge of @entity15 ’s penalty area			1
it is hard to apportion blame for the goal because keeper @entity28 did a mighty fine job in getting across his line when @entity137 smashed the free - kick towards his near post @entity67 will have forced his way into the thoughts of @entity171 with lung - bursting runs down the right wing @entity3 defender @entity48 was forced to take drastic action to stop the lively @entity67 @entity1 's side started strongly but lost their way after @entity3 equalised before half - time @entity1 sent on in - form striker @entity37 as a second - half substitute as @entity15 went in search of a second goal @entity1 faces a selection headache for second leg because the match is just three days before the @entity78 final the botched clearance , if it deserves to be called that , fell to @entity187 for the @entity3 defender to stab beyond the @entity189 no 1			1
spurs failed to respond , unable to find any rhythm after this setback			0
it happens in @entity7 , but dealing with it is everything			0
they eventually had 13 shots on goal , with an effort from @entity36 hitting the bar as the home side searched for a goal that would have given them room for manoeuvre in @entity21			2
‘ we were better in the first half , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ we created a lot of chances and we did n’t run out of energy			0
’ when @entity38 spooned another effort into the stands , he slapped the side of his head twice in the style of @entity216			2
he knew as well as anybody , it is advantage @entity3			0
@entity15 and @entity3 players compete for a corner during the @entity9 round of 32 match former @entity225 defender @entity224 was all smiles on the @entity3 bench even though he failed to make an appearance @entity15 striker @entity24 ( right ) heads past @entity3 's @entity48 on thursday night			1

@entity15 striker @entity24 showed wonderful *skill* and *composure* to volley home a @entity34 corner
@entity24 then *foolishly* gave away a free kick and @entity104 fired home during a penalty box melee
the @entity9 tie was the first of six vital *fixtures* for @entity1 's side over 17 - day period
