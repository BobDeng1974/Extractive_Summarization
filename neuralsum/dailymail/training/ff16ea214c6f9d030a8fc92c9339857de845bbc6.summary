by @entity0 for @entity1 incredible footage has emerged showing @entity5 's @entity4 air defence system simultaneously shooting down 15 rockets fired by @entity8 militants			1
the video clip , which was uploaded to @entity10 by the @entity11 ' , was filmed in an unknown location close to the @entity5 border with @entity14			0
it is believed that the militants who fired the rockets were attempting to beat the @entity4 by launching multiple missiles in one short burst in the hope that at least one may make it through			0
@entity4 has been regularly called into use during the recent seven - week - long @entity5 - @entity8 conflict , intercepting roughly 90 per cent of the hundreds of rockets fired by @entity14 - based militants - the vast majority of them aimed at densely populated areas of southern @entity5			1
the video clip , which was uploaded to @entity10 by the @entity11 ' , was filmed in an unknown location close to the @entity5 border with @entity14 the video clip begins with a scene of panic as @entity5 citizens run for shelter while the terrifying sound of air raid sirens rings out in the air			0
several seconds later the familiar sight of multiple @entity41 rockets emerge on the skyline - fired from inside @entity14 by @entity8 militants affiliated with the @entity59 organisation @entity58			1
as the rockets enter air space directly above the amateur filmmaker - who appears to have used a mobile phone to shoot the footage - the explosive sound of reactive @entity4 interceptor missiles being launched can be heard			0
within seconds all 15 of the potentially deadly @entity41 rockets are seen breaking up in mid-air as they are struck by missiles fired by the high - tech @entity5 air defence system			1
fear : the video clip begins with a scene of panic as @entity5 citizens run for shelter while the terrifying sound of air raid sirens rings out in the air strike : as the rockets enter air space directly above the amateur filmmaker the sound of reactive @entity4 interceptor missiles being launched can be heard			0
the deadly rockets are destroyed within seconds , breaking up into white puffs of smoke mid-air up close : the @entity89 ( pictured ) fired by @entity14 - based fighters are basic steel artillery shells developed and deployed in 2001 by the @entity91 - the military arm of @entity58 the @entity4 has been used by @entity5 since 2011 , having originally been developed to protect @entity5 from rockets fired by @entity96 's @entity95 group			1
during the 2006 @entity98 , approximately 4,000 @entity95 - fired rockets landed in northern @entity5 - including on @entity99 , the country 's third largest city			2
these rockets killed 44 @entity5 citizens and forced a further 250,000 to flee their homes			0
partly funded by the @entity105 , @entity4 was finally declared operational and initially deployed on 27 march 2011 near @entity106			0
within days the system was forced to contend with the first rockets fired from within the @entity14 by @entity58 - affiliated militants			1
designed to shoot down short range rockets and artillery shells from the air from distances of 2.5 to 43 miles , the @entity4 has since had to contend with thousands of rockets fired from the @entity8 territory , with the @entity5 military estimating a success rate of roughly 90 per cent			1
destroyed : although the @entity4 intercepts about 90 per cent of the rockets , those that do penetrate the system often strike densely populated areas , causing extensive property damage direct hit : militants typically fire several missiles in quick succession , in the hope that the barrage will confuse or overload the @entity4 and at least one rocket will make it through and strike an @entity5 property the @entity41 rockets fired by @entity14 - based fighters are basic steel artillery shells developed and deployed in 2001 by the @entity91 - the military arm of @entity58			1
in contrast to the highly expensive weapons used by many armed groups , the materials used in a @entity41 rocket rarely cost more than Â£ 500 - allowing them to be produced and deployed quickly			0
during the recent @entity5 - @entity8 conflict it is been estimated that rockets have been fired from @entity14 into southern @entity5 roughly every hour			2
militants typically fire several missiles in quick succession , in the hope that the barrage will confuse or overload the @entity4 and at least one rocket will make it through			2
although the @entity4 intercepts about 90 per cent of the rockets , those that do penetrate the system often strike densely populated areas , causing extensive property damage .			2

@entity155 fired by @entity58 - linked militants in @entity14 were blasted out the sky
defence system destroyed all 15 deadly rockets within seconds of launch
militants likely to have been trying to confuse @entity4 with quick barrage
@entity5 's @entity4 intercepts roughly 90 *%* of rockets fired from within @entity14
