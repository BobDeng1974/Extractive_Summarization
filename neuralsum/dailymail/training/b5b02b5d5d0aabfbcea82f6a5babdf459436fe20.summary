these stunning lunar wildlife shots are sure to eclipse all others			0
they show a range of creatures juxtaposed against a beautiful night sky and , remarkably , they were created without any editing software			1
@entity8 , 43 , was over the moon with the results after spending several months waiting for the perfect conditions for each picture			1
slime me to the moon : a snail peers up at @entity17 's natural satellite , or at least appears to do so in these cleverly shot montage pictures which used no photo - editing software and instead rely on a single long exposure moon worship : a conehead mantis appears to be gearing up to take on the moon in a fight			1
@entity8 cleverly used natural light to shoot the moon and artificial lighting to capture the image of the animal to create the remarkable images mr @entity8 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , used a special technique involving two lenses and one camera body			1
he set a long exposure while pointing his camera at the moon before removing the first lens and replacing it with a second to take a picture of the animal - all without stopping the exposure			1
mr @entity8 cleverly used natural lighting to shoot the moon and artificial lighting to capture the image of the animal			1
nocturnal : a wood mouse sits in what appears to be a window frame			0
mr @entity8 used nocturnal animals for the series and studied their habits ' on the internet you can find many similar pictures but they are made by computer programs , ' he told @entity57			1
' my challenge was to get capture in one shoot the moon and the animal without using any type of software			1
' i have always had a fascination with the moon and i wanted to include it in my images of wildlife			2
' this type of photography is really very difficult because there are so many factors to consider			0
the most important thing is to make sure all the conditions are optimal			0
' you need to consider the position of the animal , the phase of the moon , the weather conditions and the lighting			0
' i had to wait until the moon was at the desired phase and i also had to wait for a clear night so i could get a sharp image			0
' mr @entity8 used wild animals for the shots after studying the creatures closely to get an idea of their movements			1
but the musician admitted the project took a lot of patience			2
' i chose these particular animals because they all have nocturnal habits and live under the moonlight , ' he said			0
' the animals pictured are completely wild			0
they live in different habitats including woods , lakes , mountains			0
' after watching them for many years you start to learn how they behave which makes it easier to get images , although sessions are still often unsuccessful			2
what shall we do tonight brain ? two wood mice appear to plot world domination under the moonlight what a hoot ! a little owl peers back into the lens against a background of a fantastically golden moon ' in general the patience is the best trait of a wildlife photographer			2
' you have to spend a lot of time in the countryside waiting for the right conditions to get images like these			2
' it is very difficult to get all factors in the same time			0
in my opinion that is what makes these images so special			1

@entity8 created the images with no photo - editing software
he used a special technique involving a two lenses and a very long exposure
patience is *key* , he says , and he spent many months creating the pictures
