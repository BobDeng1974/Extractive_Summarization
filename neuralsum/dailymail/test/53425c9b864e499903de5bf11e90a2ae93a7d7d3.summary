@entity0 fears the threat from @entity2 in this weekend 's @entity3 , describing their pace as ' dangerous ' and ' worrying '			1
following friday practice , in particular the evening session under the lights at the @entity10 , @entity6 appeared comfortable			1
@entity0 topped the timesheet with a lap of one minute 34.647secs , finishing 0.115secs quicker than team - mate @entity14 after the reigning champion locked up in the second sector , costing him four tenths of a second			1
@entity0 has admitted he 's wary of the threat rivals @entity2 pose ahead of sunday 's @entity3 the @entity6 driver was complimentary of @entity2 and described their pace as ' dangerous ' and ' worrying ' @entity2 duo @entity21 and @entity22 finished third and fourth quickest , just over half a second adrift of @entity0			1
yet the 29 - year - old @entity24 , who trails @entity14 by 17 points in the drivers ' standings , is deeply concerned by @entity2 from what he witnessed over the course of the two 90 - minute sessions			1
' we are very quick on one lap again , and @entity2 are very dangerous on the long run , ' said @entity0			2
' they have serious pace , which is very worrying			2
it looks like they are a genuine threat			0
' in qualifying we are much quicker , but in the race they are quick			0
' @entity44 wise , it is pretty straightforward , with both tyres ( the soft and medium - compound pirellis ) quite robust			0
it is just the absolute pace which is important			0
' @entity0 ( left ) trails team - mate @entity14 by 17 points in the drivers ' standings ahead of sunday 's race barring mistakes it appears another @entity6 front - row lock - out is likely , with the @entity2 's occupying the second row , and from there a battle with strategy and pace			1
@entity14 has also expressed concerns about @entity2 as he said : ' they are going to be very close			2
they look very good , from what i can see , in the long run			0
' the crucial part is we know we have speed in a qualifying lap , so it 's more the speed on the race runs			0
' that 's an area we 're really trying to work on , but other than that the car has been feeling very good , i 'm really happy with it			0
' but the 29 - year - old topped the timesheet with a lap of one minute 34.647secs during friday practice @entity22 , 13 points adrift of @entity14 , endured a disruptive day as a loss of power compromised @entity83 , whilst a collision with @entity85 in his @entity87 hampered @entity86			1
@entity89 's @entity88 also suffered a wretched day with technical issues in both sessions , resulting in a lack of running that left him down in 19th position , 4.5 seconds behind @entity0 and sandwiched between @entity96 duo @entity95 and @entity97			2
saturday could be problematic for all , though , as a sandstorm has been forecast to hit the area at some point during the day .			0
