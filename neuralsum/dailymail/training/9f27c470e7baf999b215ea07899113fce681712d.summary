one balmy evening in @entity1 , in the summer of 2010 , a television camera followed @entity2 from a football pitch			1
@entity4 had just stumbled through a sterile draw with @entity6 and their @entity8 progress was under threat			1
the @entity4 followers started to protest at the abject display and suddenly @entity2 became aware of their jeers			1
briefly , he paused to sneer at the camera : ‘ @entity15 to see your own fans booing you , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s what loyal support is			2
’ the remark was caught by a pitch - side microphone and the subsequent outcry led the television news			2
@entity2 has matured into a leader as captain for @entity27 ( season ) and @entity4 this season at the @entity29 , @entity2 ( centre ) was attacked for condemning @entity4 fans after a 0 - 0 draw vs @entity6 the team ’s performance had been truly inept			1
high in the grandstand of the @entity36 , i tried to recall a more abject @entity38 result			2
‘ 1066 ? ’ offered a helpful neighbour			2
but somehow , @entity2 ’s reaction had made a wretched situation far worse			1
he seemed to be suggesting that the fans had no right to criticise @entity4 ’s miserable display			1
their function was to applaud , to approve , to spend their money and to offer ‘ loyal support ’			2
anything less smacked of treachery			2
for the rest of their ill - starred tournament - i.e. two more matches - @entity4 players were pilloried for a whole range of perceived offences , from arrogant entitlement to lofty indifference to undeserved affluence			1
the cliched cry of ‘ pampered prima donnas ’ rang out across the land			0
and the kid from @entity66 , whose shoulders had carried @entity4 ’s highest hopes , was no longer an idol , but a target			1
in the words of @entity4 ’s manager @entity71 : ‘ at the moment , @entity2 is n’t @entity2			1
’ @entity2 ( left ) was one of many @entity4 players to have an uninspiring match against @entity6 four years ago after being booed off by @entity4 fans , @entity2 suggested they had no right to criticise their performance monday evening at @entity79 , @entity2 will lead out a @entity27 side who seek to impose pressure on @entity83 and @entity84 at the summit of the @entity86			1
most of his colleagues have been acquired at huge expense from around the world , yet @entity2 remains the soul and the spirit of his team			1
he works harder , covers more ground , expends more energy and scores more goals than the rest			0
and he has embraced the responsibility of captaincy ; pleading , scolding , encouraging team - mates by effort and example			2
as with @entity27 , so with @entity4			1
from time to time , there have been tentative calls for @entity2 to be ‘ rested ’			1
@entity71 came under heavy pressure to bite the bullet and so , at times , has @entity110			0
both resisted and both were right to stand by their judgment			0
true , @entity2 did not always appear to justify their faith			1
there were days when the ball would bounce off his shins , when his intensity seemed reduced and the play seemed to be happening around him			0
@entity2 has been passed fit to play against @entity79 on monday after recovering from a knee injury many of us believed his physique would eventually betray him , that his heavy body would impair both endurance and acceleration , and the subsequent frustration would truncate his career			1
he has taken pleasure in proving us wrong			0
in truth , @entity2 will never be the player we dreamed he might become when @entity133 put him in their first team at 16 years old , or when @entity4 capped him a year later			1
those were the days when starry - eyed comparisons were made with @entity137 , another free spirit and perhaps the @entity38 game ’s purest talent since @entity141			2
@entity137 was the pitiful victim of alcoholism and of the cynical exploitation of those who should have protected him			0
@entity2 was never blessed with @entity137 ’s instinctive genius , but his foundations were firmer , he was fortunate in having a manager like sir @entity149 to steer him through the critical stages of his career and , in @entity151 , married a woman who shares his background and appreciates his pressures			1
he gave a fascinating interview on the occasion of his 100th cap , when he spoke of the problem of trying to prolong his @entity4 career into his thirties while still spending time with @entity151 and his sons			1
@entity2 ( left ) has had the weight of the nation 's shoulders on him since he made his @entity133 debut at 16 ‘ i actually spoke to my wife about it , ’ recalled @entity2			1
‘ i said it ’s mad how all the players are retiring			0
when you get to a certain age , you almost feel like you have to do it to extend your club career			2
she was the one who said to me , “ it ’s a short career , you have plenty of time to have your time off with us as a family when you finish playing			0
you ’ll regret it if you do			0
” ‘ i thought , “ yes , i would			0
football is what i love doing			0
playing for my country i love , i ’d regret it			2
i do n’t think i would ever walk away ”			0
’ it was the measured response of one who had given his situation some thought			0
and here , perhaps , we see the essential change in @entity2			1
at 29 , he has achieved a pleasing measure of maturity			2
we see it both in his play and in his answers to questions			0
he gives them earnest thought , considers the options and arrives at a serious conclusion			0
the trite , all - purpose cliches supplied by media advisers have been jettisoned			2
instead , we sense we are listening to a man who has discovered his own mind			0
@entity2 ( centre ) scored twice in @entity4 3 - 1 friendly win at @entity207 in november at @entity208 he will never completely abandon the old instincts			1
no matter how many more goals he may score or caps he may win , he will always be just a single calamitous tackle away from uproar			0
but @entity2 has achieved something remarkable ; he has grown up , while remaining the best kid in the playground			1
those of us who recall that sad evening in @entity1 will rejoice in the transformation			0
the 29 - year - old ( centre ) was also on target in @entity27 's 3 - 0 home win against @entity224 in the league on november 29 @entity226 , former owner of @entity227 , claims a new @entity229 documentary shamefully misrepresents his old club			1
the film paints an ugly picture of fights , physical intimidation , bullying and loutishness			0
‘ the programme portrayed the group as violent thugs , as if that was all they had to them , ’ he says			0
not having seen it , i can not usefully comment			0
but i did witness some of the repellent excesses of @entity227 ’s ‘ @entity244 ’ in the 80s and 90s			0
and i suspect the programme makers have done a pretty accurate job .			0

@entity2 condemned @entity4 fans for their support during their 2010 @entity8 clash against @entity6
the @entity4 drew the match 0 - 0 and were booed off by the supporters
@entity27 travel to @entity79 in monday 's @entity86 tie
@entity2 will lead the @entity259 at @entity260 's as they look to climb the table
29 - year - old was appointed both captain for club and country this season
