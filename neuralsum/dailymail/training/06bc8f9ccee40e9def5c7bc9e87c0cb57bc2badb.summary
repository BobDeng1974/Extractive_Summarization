would n't pay : @entity0 , did not want to give money to an organisation ' funding the practice of terrorism ' a 49 - year - old man refused to pay his tv licence because he believed the @entity8 covered up facts about the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
@entity0 , who represented himself today at @entity1 ’ court in @entity12 , said he did not want to give money to an organisation ' funding the practice of terrorism '			1
@entity0 , who admitted owning a tv and watching it without a licence , was found guilty of using an unlicensed set , given a six - month conditional discharge and told to pay £ 200 costs			1
he was visited in may 2012 by an inspector after withdrawing his licence in march , but said he was withholding the funds under the @entity24			1
section 15 of the @entity26 states that it is an offence for someone to invite another to provide money , intending that it should be used , or having reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used , for terrorism purposes			1
' i am withholding all funds from the @entity8 , the @entity34 and subsidiaries under @entity25 of the @entity24 , ’ he told the inspector			1
he added that he had already lodged a complaint with the @entity8			2
@entity0 told the court : ' i believe the @entity8 , who are directly funded by the licence fee , are furthering the purposes of terrorism and i have incontrovertible evidence to this effect			1
i do not use this word lightly given where i am			0
' he was not allowed to show his pre-prepared video evidence in court because the @entity49 said it was not relevant to the trial			0
but the major point @entity0 said he relied upon was that the @entity8 allegedly reported that @entity53 7 had fallen 20 minutes before it did			1
fan base : around 100 supporters of @entity0 arrived at @entity1 in @entity12 to watch the court case - although only 40 could pack into the public gallery he also made reference to a theory about the way the skyscraper was said to have fallen in on itself , which some people believe showed signs of a controlled demolition			1
mr @entity0 said : ' the @entity8 reported it 20 minutes before it fell			1
they knew about it beforehand			0
last time i was here i asked you ( the judge ) : “ were you aware of @entity53 7 ” ? happy : speaking outside court , @entity0 said he was ' pleased ' with the outcome , ' all things considered ' ‘ you said you had heard of it			1
ten years later you should have more than heard of it			0
it 's the @entity8 's job to inform the public			2
especially of miracles of science and when laws of physics become suspended			0
‘ they have made programmes making fools of and ridiculing those of us who believe in the laws of gravity			0
@entity92 reports have shown that the fall was nothing but a controlled demolition			0
‘ i am not looking at who demolished it - that is impossible - but the @entity8 actively tried to hide this from the public			2
' not paying a tv licence under @entity102 of the @entity103 is a strict liability offence , said @entity105 , prosecuting			2
he asked @entity0 why he continued to watch the @entity8 with no licence			1
@entity0 said : ' ignorance is not an excuse - i need to know what these people are saying			2
' he later added : ' you are asking me to commit a crime if you are asking me to pay			0
' around 100 supporters arrived at @entity1 ’ court today to watch the court case - although only 40 could pack into the public gallery			2
the court called in back - up from @entity119 with two officers standing at the door to the court and several more outside			0
there was cheering and applause as @entity0 put his case forward in court			2
flashback : this is a grab from @entity130 's breaking news coverage of the september 11 attacks in 2001 district judge @entity132 said : ' this is not a public inquiry into 9/11			0
this is an offence under section 363 of the @entity103			0
' he said he had difficulty sitting in the magistrates ’ court as he ' did not believe he had the power to rule under the terrorism act '			0
' i believe the @entity8 , who are directly funded by the licence fee , are furthering the purposes of terrorism and i have incontrovertible evidence to this effect			1
i do not use this word lightly given where i am ' @entity0 he said : ' even if i accept the evidence you say , this court has no power to create a defence in the manner which you put forward			0
' sentencing , judge @entity132 said : ' mr @entity0 puts the basis of his defence under @entity25 of the @entity24 , effectively asking the court to find the @entity8 is a terrorist organisation and that if he continues to pay them he himself is committing a criminal offence			1
' i have explained to mr @entity0 even if i were to accept his evidence i would be unable to find a defence			0
' speaking outside court , @entity0 said he was ' pleased ' with the outcome , ' all things considered ' .			0

@entity0 represented himself at @entity1 in @entity170
told inspector on visit in may 2012 that he would not be paying licence fee
@entity0 said he was withholding fee under @entity177
this states it 's an offence for someone to provide funds used for terrorism
he said he did n't want to give money to an organisation ' funding terrorism '
@entity0 said @entity8 *claimed* @entity53 7 fell 20 minutes before it did
but judge made @entity0 pay £ 200 costs and gave him conditional discharge
