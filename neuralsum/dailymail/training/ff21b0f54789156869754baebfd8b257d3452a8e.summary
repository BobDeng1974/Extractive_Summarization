by @entity0 @entity1 has warned @entity2 to expect a @entity4 baptism of fire should he agree to step into the @entity6 hotseat			1
@entity7 , @entity6 ’s largest shareholder , has held ‘ informal talks ’ with the former @entity11 captain concerning the @entity13 job vacated by @entity14			1
the @entity16 champions insisted last night @entity2 has not been offered the job and released a statement claiming they are still talking to ‘ a number ’ of candidates			1
mentor : ex-celtic boss @entity1 has told @entity2 to expect @entity24 baptism of fire boyhood dream : @entity2 played for @entity6 for a few months during the twilight of his career and @entity1 made it clear he wants his right - hand man to stay			1
indeed , with just eight weeks until a crucial @entity4 qualifier at @entity31 , he urged @entity2 to consider the implications of stepping into a high - pressure situation			2
‘ @entity6 are back so early because they ’re involved in those big ( @entity35 ) games , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ so it is a case of that being only a matter of days away rather than weeks - and i ’m sure that ’s something to consider			0
‘ it was only brought home to me the other day when @entity41 was mentioning he would not be coming with us to @entity43 because he would have had no break because @entity6 are back training very , very quickly because he ’s had no break whatsoever			2
‘ if @entity2 is actually offered the job then he ’ll have things to consider			1
the very obvious thing to consider is the speed at which he would go into a big football club and have big , big games right on his doorstep			0
’ a @entity6 manager for five years , @entity1 remains an iconic figure at @entity13 and will advise his right - hand man carefully			1
he admitted : ‘ i have spoken to him			0
i had a call the other day from @entity7 wanting to speak to @entity2 if it was at all possible , and i mentioned it to @entity2 , of course			1
‘ i am sure he was wanting to have chat anyway because a club like @entity6 might not come around too often			2
‘ it was just a really informal chat , i think , but if you are asking me would i be really disappointed ? of course if @entity2 was to leave us			1
‘ but i kind of felt that when i took him on in the first place , that over the course of the next 18 months to two years , that this thing was likely to happen			0
‘ he was coming right back into high profile again			0
perhaps i did n’t expect it to happen so quickly , but @entity6 is one - he has had a number of offers too from other football clubs as well - so he has obviously a lot to consider			1
’ informal chat : @entity77 boss @entity1 says @entity2 has spoken with @entity6 owner @entity7 new job : @entity2 , the @entity77 assistant manager , is set to be named as the new @entity6 boss still got it : keane on the ball during an @entity83 training session ahead of saturday friendly with @entity84 in @entity85 @entity2 endured mixed fortunes in charge of @entity88 and @entity89 and @entity6 fans have reacted coolly to news of the talks			1
he has been out of frontline management since being sacked by @entity89 in january last year			0
insisting the @entity95 stint - brokered by @entity7 and funded by his billionaire business crony @entity96 - has rehabilitated the former midfielder , however , @entity1 said : ‘ @entity2 has been great for me , i ’ve genuinely enjoyed working with him , he ’s sometimes a totally different character to the one you see in front of the tv camera			1
‘ he ’s been excellent , the players have enjoyed him immensely			0
‘ i can only say that naturally i ’d be disappointed if he left because i really think he ’s been terrific			0
‘ i ’ve often said here that he ’ll be a manager again himself			0
i just did n’t expect it that quickly			0
again , it was only an informal discussion he was having			2
i do n’t know the ins and outs of it , i do n’t know , i think they do have a list of people they ’re speaking to and , you never know , they might speak to someone else ‘ i just reiterate he would n’t take it lightly			0
he loves it here , genuinely loves it here			0
it ’s been great for him			0
’ discussion : @entity2 talks to manager @entity1 as coaches @entity123 and @entity125 watch on pundits : @entity2 and @entity1 on air for @entity128 during coverage of a @entity4 tie last season the statement from @entity6 last night made it clear @entity2 is but one of the candidates they are looking at			1
it read : ‘ following speculation concerning the manager ’s position at @entity6 the club can confirm that it is currently continuing its discussions with a number of excellent candidates			1
’ but last night @entity144 backed @entity2 to show the right stuff as @entity6 manager and said : ‘ i ’m sure he ’d be a good man for the job			1
‘ as a player i think the club needs a big character and he definitely fits the bill			0
‘ he ’s a strong character and probably the type of guy that would be good for the job			2
‘ of course , we want a manager as soon as possible because it gets us prepared for the @entity4 qualifiers			0
‘ but i ’m sure the club will take its time to get the right man			2
as long as it ’s a big character			0
i ’m sure the club will look into it and find the right man for the job			2
’ one player who may not be around to see @entity2 ’s potential takeover is goalkeeper @entity169 with @entity170 placing him on a list of potential replacements for @entity173 .			2
