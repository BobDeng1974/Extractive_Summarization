@entity0 is that type of male who has a peculiar effect on the opposite sex			1
even the most reserved young ladies are provoked into throwing themselves at him			0
the fact that he does nothing to encourage such attention ( he seems almost bemused by it ) simply spurs on the girls even more			0
he is absurdly handsome , ridiculously tall ( 6 ft 4 in ) , a brilliant sportsman — dashing on the polo field and an accomplished off - piste skier — clever , charming and well - read			1
his mother , @entity24 , is the @entity25 , having acquired the title upon her second marriage to @entity0 ’s stepfather , the @entity29			1
his father is @entity31 , a debonair @entity32			1
indeed , if @entity0 were n’t such a nice chap , it might seem unfair that he has been bestowed with so many advantages in life			1
for the eminently eligible @entity18 is ‘ the other @entity0 ’ — the @entity0 who was photographed holding hands with @entity20 , prince @entity0 ’s former girlfriend , on @entity21 ’s night			1
@entity20 ’s two - year romance with the @entity0 ended last april			1
now , there is every indication she has moved on with another @entity0			1
but all is not quite what it seems , for @entity20 ’s new man was actually on the romance scene first — and , as we will see , never really went away			1
@entity50 , who turned 26 last week , had a serious relationship with @entity0 when they were both students at @entity52			1
the couple were known to their crowd — for reasons that are n’t entirely clear — as ‘ @entity57 ’			0
friends say she was heartbroken when he took off for a gap year to @entity62 in 2011 after graduating , and the romance petered out			0
indeed , @entity20 was n’t quite over @entity0 when another @entity64 — prince @entity0 himself — began pursuing her in the summer of 2012 and a romance began			1
there were concerts , rugby matches , skiing trips and cosy nights in at @entity73			0
for a time , they were happy			0
if not forgotten , the other @entity0 was relegated to the back of her mind			1
but just months into her new relationship , @entity0 returned from @entity62			1
it seems he was keen to pick up with @entity20 exactly where he had left off			1
according to a friend , he had been smitten by a girl in @entity83 , but it had come to nothing			0
soon , there were reports @entity88 was trying to win back @entity20 while prince @entity0 was on a tour of duty in @entity90			1
we do n’t know whether that was correct or not , but the following summer , @entity20 and @entity88 were seen ‘ flirting ’ in a bar			1
prince @entity0 and @entity20 are seen here , before they split , leaving the @entity95 , @entity96 in october 2013 cracks soon began to appear in @entity20 ’s romance with the @entity0			1
@entity50 , who enjoys the limelight to a degree ( she ’s a fledgling actress , after all ) was disturbed to find herself photographed by strangers on their phones in the street			0
but she was keen on the @entity0 and wanted a serious relationship with a degree of commitment			1
they split last april — the final straw for @entity20 apparently being the @entity0 ’s refusal to pay her £ 650 air fare to attend his friend @entity112 ’s wedding in @entity114			1
in the meantime , it seems the other @entity0 was playing a waiting game			1
their recent date suggests a rekindling of the romance			0
‘ @entity20 was dotty about @entity0 at university and , when he went off to @entity62 , she was heartbroken , ’ says a friend			1
‘ then the antidote came along in the form of @entity0			1
now that ’s all over , it ’s not surprising that she and @entity88 are gravitating towards one another again			0
‘ they ’ve stayed close since the split , and he has always been a threat to @entity0			1
’ @entity0 ( left ) is seen here with his mother @entity134 ( right ) at the @entity136 charity polo match and dinner at @entity138 it is n’t clear whether @entity0 and @entity20 are officially an item yet , but appearances suggest they are			1
his admirers will be devastated			0
‘ @entity0 has girls swooning over him , but he is a level - headed young man and deals with it all with a grin and good grace , ’ says the friend			1
‘ he has invitations pouring in night after night , but he avoids the limelight			0
he prefers weekends in country houses , riding , walking his dogs and swimming			0
mr @entity31 , 26 , is not the idle trust - fund aristo of popular stereotype			2
he is training to become a surveyor with @entity158 and lives in a relatively modest flat in @entity160			0
on the surface , he appears to have led a charmed life and , for most of his childhood , that was so			0
he inherited his looks from his mother , @entity24 , a beauty who remains stunning at 54			2
there was a brother , @entity171 , four years his senior , and younger sister @entity173			0
when @entity0 was a child , his mother and father divorced			1
in 1997 , @entity24 married @entity177 , @entity29 , a cousin of the @entity179 , himself divorced with two children			2
@entity20 , pictured at the @entity181 , 2015 , is said to have had a serious relationship with @entity0 when they were both students at @entity52 the family settled at @entity185 , an estate set in 1,000 acres in the @entity187			1
for a time , life was perfect			0
@entity24 stayed on good terms with her former husband , @entity190 , who went on to marry @entity193 beauty @entity191 , with whom he had three more children			0
shortly before christmas 2006 , the @entity29 and @entity25 and their children went to stay with @entity31 and his wife in @entity197			2
@entity171 , @entity0 ’s elder brother , was recovering from a relatively minor procedure			2
the operation was a success , but @entity171 had become very anxious in the days that followed			0
one evening , the family were gathered in the house when they heard a shot fired			0
they rushed outside to find @entity171 lying dead			0
the family was shattered by the tragedy			0
@entity0 ( left ) pictured with his father , lord @entity209 ( right ) , at @entity210 at @entity211 in 2012 @entity24 was floored by her son ’s suicide			1
touchingly , it was @entity0 , then 17 , who helped her through it			2
she said in an interview 18 months after @entity171 ’ death : ‘ for the sake of the other children , you have to set an example			0
if you are strong , it gives them permission to be strong			0
if you fall to bits , they will			0
‘ the day after @entity171 died , his brother @entity0 said his biggest fear was that it would destroy me , and that would destroy everything else			2
it suddenly made me feel how important i was			0
’ @entity0 had to grow up quickly			2
‘ he was an absolute rock to his mother , ’ says a friend			2
‘ after @entity171 died , he became much more grown - up			0
’ prince @entity0 ’s life , too , has been overshadowed by the tragic death of his mother , @entity237 , in the car crash in @entity239 in 1997			1
but the two @entity240 appear to have coped with the hand they have been dealt in different ways			0
while @entity0 has become mature and grounded , prince @entity0 , at times , can seem like a lost soul			2
@entity20 , pictured in january this year , received favourable reviews for her appearance in the play there ’s a monster in @entity251 , and was described as a ‘ fantastic ’ actress by movie mogul @entity253 ‘ he ’s a bit of a @entity256 in a way , ’ says another source			2
‘ he ca n’t quite grow up			0
he wants happiness and security , but when there ’s a possibility of finding it , he sabotages it			0
’ what he thinks of reports of @entity20 ’s @entity267 ’s date is n’t clear			2
according to one friend , however , he sent @entity20 a text wishing her a happy birthday			2
‘ they are still friends — there was n’t a dramatic falling out , ’ says the source			0
according to the source , @entity50 ’s mother , four - times - married @entity274 , was saddened when they split and had hoped there might be a reconciliation			2
another of her daughters , @entity281 , had a flirtation with prince @entity283 when he split temporarily from @entity284 before their marriage			0
she went on to marry @entity286 , sir @entity287 ’s son			0
‘ there is a sense that one of her girls slipped through the net , and she was keen for it not to happen with @entity20 , ’ says the source			2
‘ she adored the fact @entity50 was prince @entity0 ’s girlfriend			2
’ whether prince @entity0 will now be spurred into trying to win back @entity20 remains to be seen			1
since splitting from @entity0 , @entity20 ’s profile has not dimmed			1
she received favourable reviews for her appearance in the play there ’s a monster in @entity251 , and has a small part in forthcoming film @entity304 , which also stars @entity306			0
last month , movie mogul @entity253 , the film ’s producer , described @entity50 , as a ‘ fantastic ’ actress			0
asked about her relationship with mr @entity0 , @entity20 ’s representatives said ‘ no comment ’			1
@entity0 ’s mother , @entity313 , said she ‘ did n’t get involved in that area of @entity0 ’s life and could n’t comment ’			1
‘ @entity0 was @entity50 ’s first real love and he has blossomed into a good - looking , fun - loving , but caring chap , ’ says a friend			1
‘ he has all the right connections , without the royal blood and hang - ups			0
’ both @entity240 are undoubtedly a catch , but mr @entity0 looks like the best long - term bet			1
and if it does n’t work out with @entity20 , he can be consoled that there is a long queue behind her .			2
