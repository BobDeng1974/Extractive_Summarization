by @entity0 @entity1 is a class act i could watch @entity1 all day			1
he might not get the same hype that @entity5 does , but @entity1 is a maestro in midfield			1
he could have even more success in that no 10 role but it ’s tough to displace @entity5			1
the @entity10 scored twice on saturday - one with his left foot , one with his right - and he is the best two - footed player in the league			2
he ’s so good that sometimes it ’s hard to know which is his stronger foot			2
he makes the ball talk and he ’s got a football brain the size of a planet			2
strike it lucky : @entity1 scored both goals as @entity21 beat @entity22 @entity23 man : @entity1 was @entity21 's match winner on saturday he sees the whole picture and has a fantastic understanding of the game			1
what i like about him is he does n’t look like your standard footballer			2
he ’s got an odd body shape and 10 or 15 years ago not many clubs would have gone near him			2
but he ’s an artist and brings a real joy to the fans			2
if you like that kind of player , there ’s nobody better to watch			0
@entity42 's tripple threat @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 were magnificent against @entity46			1
they complemented each other so well and caused problems , particularly in the first half			0
@entity43 gave @entity51 a torrid time , working hard and pressing him into errors , @entity45 led the line brilliantly and @entity44 was so dangerous on the break with his pace			1
but over the last three seasons , @entity42 have finished on average just five points above the drop zone , which is not good enough			1
they have the quality and @entity42 fans will now be asking why they ca n’t play this way every week			1
three wise men : @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 celebrate the first goal @entity45 's back @entity45 scored his second goal in two games on saturday , but he showed how valuable his all - round game is			1
he hit the joint most passes of any player at @entity71 ( 57 ) , which is unusual for a striker			0
and as the map below shows , they came all over the pitch			0
all over : @entity45 made 37 passes during the game the power of @entity79 four clean sheets kept by @entity82 under @entity83			1
@entity83 has rejuvenated @entity82 and the way the @entity86 fans saluted him tells you the kind of impact he can have			1
since taking over , @entity82 have won four matches and escaped the bottom three			1
they ’ve still scored the fewest goals in the league ( 14 ) , but only @entity21 ( six ) have more clean sheets since @entity83 took over			1
making a difference : @entity83 has guided @entity82 out of the bottom three another @entity98 classic i have talked about @entity98 many times in this column but i ’m not ashamed to mention him again			1
against @entity102 he produced yet another superb performance			0
his all - round game was just too much for them			0
he plays with the @entity106 on his back but he ’s no sitting midfielder			0
he roams around the pitch and gets involved everywhere , as his pitch map shows			0
special player : @entity98 celebrates his goal against @entity102 running the show : the heat map shows how @entity98 got around the pitch @entity115 will want the transfer window to shut because @entity98 gives @entity118 ’s midfield an extra dimension and he now has to be worth at least £ 20million			2
i do n’t think @entity21 , @entity121 or @entity122 would be in the market for him , but he could be a real target for @entity126 , particularly with their problems in midfield			1
united need players who are better than what they have got and , though he ’s not world class , @entity98 would fit the bill			0
@entity133 crowns his king @entity134 @entity135 took the defensive midfield role to a new level			1
he offered a shield in front of @entity140 and @entity141 , denying @entity142 and @entity143 any room to breathe			0
but at times he was so deep it was more like watching a back five than a back four			0
i ’ve never seen a midfielder head the ball more - @entity140 and @entity141 barely had to go up for any of @entity150 ’s goal kicks			0
making it his own : @entity135 impressed in his role as a defensive midfielder i was at the game and it was clearly something @entity122 had worked on			1
you could see @entity160 barking orders at him to hold that line			0
@entity160 clearly thought : ‘ @entity135 is going to be my base , now it ’s up to my front players to go out and win it			1
’ with a comfortable lead @entity160 , ever the pragmatist , ended up with seven defensive players on the pitch			2
@entity172 's company six points separate the top three championship teams and it might be up to three forwards to fire their sides to promotion			2
@entity179 at @entity180 , @entity182 ’s @entity181 and @entity183 at @entity184 could well be the difference			0
football must stick to the facts if we needed more proof that a fifth official and video replays wo n’t work in football , it came this weekend			1
the @entity195 penalty debate has raged on with plenty of disagreement			0
people say a fifth official would solve the problem			0
how can they be expected to make the correct decision each time when people ca n’t even agree ? i was in the tv studio on saturday with @entity208 , who is @entity42 through and through			1
we both thought it was a penalty			0
if @entity212 does not come rushing out , there is no penalty but a lot of people will disagree			0
going down : @entity195 is fouled by @entity42 goalkeeper @entity212 on his way down : @entity195 falls down after a foul by @entity212 if calls like this went upstairs , you would end up waiting around and any decision would still be questioned			2
goal - line technology has been fantastic			0
but debates are part of the reason we love football and with incidents like this , it proves they are a matter of opinion , not fact .			0

@entity1 *outshines* @entity5 as @entity21 stay top
@entity42 need to see more from @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45
@entity83 is the king of the @entity82
@entity135 has made the defensive midfield role his own
and why video replays should not be brought in to help officials
