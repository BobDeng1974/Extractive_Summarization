by @entity0 the solar powered plane that is set to try and fly around the world without using fuel next year has been unveiled			1
pilots @entity4 and @entity6 said the @entity7 2 improves dramatically upon the single - seater prototype that first took flight five years ago			1
they say the technology has advanced so much the new design could remain in the air indefinitely			1
the @entity38 team planning to complete the first round - the - world solar flight next year have already demonstrated that a solar - powered plane can fly through the night , between two continents and across the @entity46			1
at 72 meters ( 236 feets ) its wingspan is eight meters longer than the first prototype - longer even than the wings of a @entity21 jumbo jet - but still only weights 2.3 metric tons ( 2.54 tons ) , about as much as a large car			1
the materials in the updated plane are also lighter than before , it has more efficient electric motors , and a ' good business class seat , ' @entity6 said			1
because while the journey will be broken up into several stages , the aircraft 's slow speed means it will have to stay in the air for several days in a row during the long transoceanic legs			2
80 companies contributed cutting - edge technologies to the plane , which is meant to showcase the possibility of using cleaner energy sources			2
@entity6 said the trip next year would take about 20 flying days , spread over several months			2
how it works : the developers worked with over 80 hi - tech firms to develop the craft @entity7 is the product of an alliance between two men to fulfill a project deemed impossible by industry experts			2
while @entity4 , a psychiatrist and explorer , sourced partners to finance the project and promoted the cause for clean technologies ( subsequently endorsed by many political authorities ) , engineer and entrepreneur @entity6 brought together and led a technical team of 80			2
it has taken 12 years of calculations , simulations , construction and testing to arrive at today ’s launch of @entity91 – the most revolutionary aircraft of out of time , set to fly around the world			2
the round the world trip , planned for next year would take about 20 flying days , spread over several months			0
the attempt to make the first round - the - world solar - powered flight is scheduled to start in march 2015 from @entity102 area			1
@entity7 will fly , in order , over the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , the @entity108 , the @entity46 , the @entity109 and @entity110 or @entity111 before closing the loop by returning to the departure point			0
landings will be made every few days to change pilots and organize public events for governments , schools and universities			0
' a vision counts for nothing unless it is backed up by action , ' said @entity4 , founder and chairman of @entity7			0
' with 8 world records for @entity7 1 , the first solar aircraft capable of flying during the night , crossing two continents and flying over the @entity46 , we have shown that clean technologies and renewable energies can accomplish the impossible , ' ' now we need to go even further , ' added @entity6 , co-founder and ceo			1
' @entity91 will have virtually unlimited autonomy , and now we need to make sure the pilot is as sustainable as his aircraft			0
' this is why the round - the - world flight will be as much a human as a technological feat. ' to complete the round - the - world flight , @entity91 will have to accomplish what no other aircraft has achieved before : flying without fuel with only one pilot for 5 consecutive days and nights over oceans from one continent to another			0
this is the challenge for which the aircraft has been built			0
there is a 3.8 m3 cockpit , every detail of which has been designed for a pilot to live there for a week			0
h however , for the sake of maximum energy efficiency , the cabin is not pressurized or heated – a further endurance challenge for the pilot			0
test flights are due to take place in may , followed by training flights over @entity38			0
people look at the second @entity7 experimental solar - powered plane , the @entity164 , to be used for a round - the - world voyage next year , during its presentation in @entity37 on april 9 , 2014			1
the pilots admitted on improvement since the prototypes was a ' business class ' seat for the pilots			0
the huge aircraft carries just two people , but has a larger wingspan than a @entity21			1

7,200 solar cells cover its massive wings
at 72 meters ( 236 feets ) its wingspan is longer even than the wings of a @entity21 jumbo jet
