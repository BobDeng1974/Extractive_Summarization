by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 in just three days as manager of @entity5 , @entity3 re-signed @entity6 , settled his differences with @entity8 and told forgotten front man @entity9 he would lead the line at @entity11			1
on saturday , all three scored			2
until last wednesday , @entity3 , at 65 , was a semi-retired radio presenter			1
it certainly did n’t take long to hit the right frequency on his return to the @entity5 dugout — 31 seconds , in fact			1
that was the time of @entity9 ’s goal , but it was @entity22 ’s strike some 95 minutes later that salvaged a point			1
a £ 15million misfit at @entity26 — the club he joined from @entity5 last summer — the winger had been written off , his attitude questioned and his confidence shattered			1
talent : @entity5 described @entity6 as a phenomenal talent after his equaliser against @entity11 in just 24 hours @entity3 changed that , a season - long loan deal having been completed only on friday			1
‘ it ’s difficult for such a young lad at such a massive club , where you can easily get swallowed up , ’ said the new boss			2
‘ maybe at that top level they wonder if they can rely on him but he just needs to be given that bit of freedom			2
he needs to enjoy himself			2
‘ there were four or five clubs after him but he ’s come back to a club he knows			2
i do n’t know where it comes from all this about @entity57 ’s attitude being poor			2
i think it might be because he slows play right down and he can look a little arrogant on the pitch and he wears those lilac - pink boots			2
@entity60 : @entity3 has had an immediate impact since returning to @entity5 for a second spell ‘ i do n’t think he was given too much of a chance at @entity26 , but he can really enjoy this season			1
’ like @entity22 , @entity66 failed to make the grade at @entity68 but he is in no doubt as to the ability of his 21 - year - old team - mate			2
‘ he ’s a phenomenal talent , ’ said @entity66			1
‘ maybe being closer to where he grew up will suit him			0
what you need to do is give him the ball and let him run at people			0
that ’s what he ’s brilliant at			0
’ @entity8 volleyed @entity5 ’s second after @entity83 had levelled			1
@entity8 was fined £ 15,000 last season for derogatory comments posted on @entity86 about @entity3 in response to criticism of a penalty miss at @entity90 but @entity3 said : ‘ it was n’t hard not to bear a grudge			1
there ’s too many turnovers in football			0
@entity95 : both @entity22 and @entity8 scored in the @entity5 ' 3 - 3 draw against @entity11 ‘ will he take the next penalty ? you ’ll just have to wait and see on that one			1
but his goal was incredible from that angle			0
it was a great finish			0
’ @entity3 was denied victory by @entity11 ’s livewire winger @entity102 injecting life — and goals — into a previously predictable home effort following his second - half introduction			1
trailing 2 - 1 , the 18 - year - old ’s header — his first senior goal — brought the contest level before he set up @entity111 for what should have been the winner two minutes from time			0
@entity22 , though , had the last word when he pounced after @entity11 failed to clear from a free - kick			1
it was a happy ending for @entity3 , whose dog had died earlier in the day			1
‘ my wife rang me when i got off the plane , it was unexpected , ’ he said			0
‘ but @entity121 had been to the vet , he had cancer			0
he was a lovely dog			0
when you live in @entity126 it ’s a great place to walk dogs in the peace and quiet			0
’ peace and quiet are a thing of the past for @entity3 now — but he ’ll certainly be hoping the likes of @entity22 can make a big noise this season			1
super stat : @entity5 have conceded injury - time goals in their last two visits to @entity11			1
this time it was their turn , @entity22 scoring the latest goal of the @entity141 season so far			0
@entity11 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity142 5.5 ; @entity83 7 ( @entity143 79min ) , @entity144 6 , @entity111 6.5 , @entity145 6 ; @entity146 6.5 , @entity147 5.5 ; @entity148 5 , @entity149 5 ( @entity150 79 ) , @entity151 4.5 ( @entity102 67 , 8 ) ; @entity152 5			2
