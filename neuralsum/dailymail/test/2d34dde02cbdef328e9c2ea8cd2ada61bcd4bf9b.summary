@entity0 signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges			1
abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the @entity6 if he was too frail to be brought before court			1
the @entity8 has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that @entity0 would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has alzheimer ’s disease			1
but now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an april 9 note to @entity6 authorities			1
his signature has been redacted for privacy reasons the former @entity28 mp , 86 , claimed more than £ 100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009			0
he has not attended the @entity6 since detectives raided his @entity34 home in december 2013			1
last october he took a formal leave of absence from @entity37 , allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months ’ notice			0
new rules which came into effect last may provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks			0
but @entity0 requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior @entity6 official 12 days ago			1
a @entity6 spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself , but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his			1
@entity55 , the @entity28 politician who exposed the late @entity27 mp @entity57 ’s horrific abuse of boys , said it was not right for @entity0 to stay in the @entity6 yet avoid court			1
‘ if you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator , then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law , ’ he said			2
‘ if he has got a leave of absence from the @entity6 , that implies that he may get well			1
why is n’t he retiring ? it makes a mockery of it all			0
he is bringing the @entity6 into disrepute almost single - handedly			1
’ the @entity8 faced widespread criticism after announcing that @entity0 ( pictured ) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has @entity75 ’s disease @entity76 , chief executive of the @entity77 in @entity78 , added : ‘ he could n’t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis			1
‘ but if he is n’t compos mentis , there ’s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature			0
how can they say he ’s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting @entity93 war criminals ? ‘ it stinks of the @entity96 covering up and ensuring he does n’t have to take the stand in public			0
this is a cover - up , there can be no question about it			0
’ @entity0 ’s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former @entity105 constituency			2
he was suspended by @entity28 after the @entity8 ruled last thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988			1
but director of public prosecutions @entity110 said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction			0
allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of @entity118 , a manager of @entity121 children ’s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys			2
after @entity118 was jailed , many other politicians spoke out in support of @entity0 in a @entity126 debate led by @entity129 @entity128 mp @entity127			2
mr @entity127 , 74 , who stood down from @entity37 in 1997 after being caught up in the @entity132 government ’s sleaze scandals , appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday			2
‘ of course i did n’t know anything at the time , ’ he said from his home in @entity136			0
‘ the man has dementia and should be left alone			0
’ director of public prosecutions @entity110 said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the @entity0 's @entity144 son prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the @entity0 case			1
director of public prosecutions @entity110 said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the @entity28 peer ’s @entity144 son			2
@entity154 , who was based at the 23 @entity156 chambers where @entity157 works , was consulted by mrs @entity110 before she concluded not to prosecute			0
senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about mr @entity154 ’s involvement in the decision - making process			0
but a spokesman for the @entity164 ’s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that mr @entity154 informed her of the connection before any discussions took place			0
she said mr @entity154 was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to mr @entity0 for two years			2
the potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for mrs @entity110 as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision			0
last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge @entity0			1
@entity177 recommended a ‘ trial of the facts ’ in the defendant ’s absence to ‘ get to the bottom of the allegations ’			0
a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ it is the @entity110 ’s job to make these extremely difficult decisions , and that is what the @entity110 has done			2

@entity0 told the @entity6 he wanted to remain a peer earlier this month
a week later the @entity8 ruled that he was unfit to face child sex charges
@entity0 escaped prosecution over allegations because he has @entity75 's
but he was apparently well enough to sign his name in a note to the @entity6
