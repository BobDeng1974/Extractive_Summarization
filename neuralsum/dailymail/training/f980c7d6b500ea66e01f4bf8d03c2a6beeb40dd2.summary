by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 02:14 est , 19 april 2013 if you , like millions of others , are seduced by @entity4 deals when shopping for that shiny new kitchen appliance or camera , beware			1
it turns out that some of those tempting savings are not quite as good as advertised			1
the world ’s largest online retailer and rivals @entity10 and @entity14 have been accused of making bogus claims of bargains on kitchen appliances and other electrical goods			1
cheap : but @entity4 is accused of exaggerating the savings it offers on many electrical appliances all three boasted of big discounts on washing machines , cameras and irons – coaxing shoppers with savings on ‘ original ’ prices – but which actually offered little or no real saving			1
the @entity32 had already put retailers on notice , threatening legal action and fines over attempts to fool shoppers with fake price cuts			0
now research by which ? has found a series of examples in which retailers apparently failed to play straight with families seeking value for money			0
the consumer champion tracked prices for more than five months at the three retailers , the @entity50 ’s biggest sellers of electrical and white goods			0
bargain ? a @entity54 camera similar to this one was said to be £ 130 cheaper than its @entity56 on @entity4 , but in fact was just £ 30 less than normal deals : a @entity61 steam iron , left , and @entity63 washing machine , right , were also involved it found some of the original prices they used as the benchmark for price - cut claims were long out of date			1
some also used what they claimed was a recommended retail price for a kitchen appliance as the basis for the claim of a big price reduction			0
however , which ? found the true manufacturer ’s recommended price was often lower – with the result the saving was less than claimed			0
for example , @entity4 advertised a @entity54 camera for £ 198.86 , which it claimed was a saving of £ 130.14 against the @entity56 of £ 329			1
in fact the manufacturer was selling the camera for £ 229 , which meant the saving was a more modest £ 30.14			1
misleading : @entity14 promised to investigate the anomalies unearthed by which ? magazine sale : @entity10 claimed an iron was on offer , but it was available from the manufacturer for the same price @entity54 camera ( @entity99 ) - @entity100 : sale price of £ 198.86 - save £ 130.14 on the @entity56 of £ 329reality : saving of £ 30.14 on the @entity103 price of £ 229 @entity105 camera ( s9300 ) - @entity106 : sale price of £ 179.99 - £ 201.03 - save £ 98.96 - £ 120 on the @entity56 of £ 299.99reality : @entity56 was £ 50 less at £ 249.99 @entity63 washing machine ( @entity108 ) - @entity109 : save £ 88.99reality : original higher benchmark price had been charged more than a year earlier in 2011 @entity61 eco steam iron ( 40625 ) - @entity10 claim : sale price of £ 29.99 - save £ 10reality : no saving on the £ 29.99 charged by @entity61 @entity10 sold a @entity61 steam iron for £ 29.99 , which it claimed was a price cut of £ 10			1
but this ‘ offer price ’ was actually the same as the manufacturer ’s own retail price			0
which ? executive director @entity120 said : ‘ when household budgets are squeezed it is unacceptable that shoppers are confused into thinking that they ’re getting a good deal when that might not be the case			0
’ @entity4 said it has updated the @entity56 prices on the two cameras highlighted by which ? , and said it liaises with manufacturers to provide the most up to date information to shoppers			2
@entity14 thanked which ? and promised to investigate the price anomalies it highlighted			2
@entity10 said it ‘ strongly refuted any suggestion that its deals are not genuine ’			2
the firm said its offers fully comply with official guidance			0
@entity32 chief executive @entity139 said : ‘ shoppers should be able to trust that special offers and promotions really are bargains			2

@entity4 , @entity10 and @entity14 advertised *massive* savings on appliances
but they are accused of *inflating* @entity149 to make them look like bargains
@entity103 camera said to be £ 130 cheaper than usual but it was actually £ 30
