by @entity0 it might look like a giant whale in the sky , but this super-size plane is in fact @entity7 ’s answer to shipping spacecraft components around the world			0
dubbed the @entity11 , the aircraft is able to swallow other planes whole and has played a vital role in missions including @entity15 and @entity16			1
the @entity11 was first created in 1962 as a successor to the aptly - named @entity19 cargo aircraft			2
dubbed the @entity11 , the aircraft is able to swallow other planes whole and has played a vital role in missions including @entity15 and @entity16 pregnant @entity19 helped achieve president @entity24 's goal of getting to the moon by the end of the 1960s			1
without @entity19 , the only other way to get the @entity30 rocket stages from @entity31 to @entity32 was on a slow boat through the @entity34			0
the @entity19 was so successful that @entity35 built a second larger @entity11 for larger , heavier loads			0
there have been five @entity38 built today , helping move spacecraft parts and fuel to vital locations , according to a report in @entity43			0
the @entity11 is more than 20ft ( 7 metres ) longer than an @entity44 and has a wingspan of 156 ft 3 inches ( 47.6 metres ) compared to an @entity44 wingspan of 117 ft 5 inches ( 35.8 metres ) two retired @entity48 - 38 trainers mounted on a transport pallet atop a mobile transporter are positioned for loading aboard @entity7 's @entity11 there have been five @entity38 built today , helping move spacecraft parts and fuel to vital locations equipment and fuel is loaded and unloaded via a hinged nose at the front of the huge plane , according to @entity7 crew : four length : 143 ft 10 in ( 43.84 m ) @entity62 : 156 ft 3 in ( 47.625 m ) height : 48 ft 6 in ( 14.78 m ) wing area : 1,964.6 ft² ( 182.51 m² ) empty weight : 101,500 lb ( 46,039 kg ) useful load : 54,500 lb ( 24,720 kg ) @entity68 takeoff weight : 170,000 lb ( 77,110 kg ) maximum speed : 250 knots ( 288 mph , 463 km / h ) @entity71 speed : 220 knots ( 253 mph , 407 km / h range : 1,986 miles ( 3,219 km ) @entity7 describes the craft , which looks like it should n’t be able to fly , as ‘ an innovative composite rocket fuel tank			1
’ equipment and fuel is loaded and unloaded via a hinged nose at the front of the huge plane			0
the original @entity11 measured 141 ft ( 43m ) long by 25 ft wide ( 8m ) and could carry 54,000lbs ( 24500kg ) of cargo at a cruising speed of 300 mph			1
the later @entity82 has a 156 ft ( 48m ) wingspan , is143 ft ( 44m ) long and 37 ft ( 11m ) tall			1
it can carry a payload over 52,500 lbs ( 24,000kg ) at 290 mph up to 564 miles			1
the most important difference between it and its predecessor was an upgrade to more reliable and readily available @entity91 turboprops			0
@entity92 commissioned and operated four @entity93 transport aircraft to ferry large @entity95 fuselage sections throughout @entity96 during the last three decades of the 20th century			0
when @entity44 retired its fleet to museums in 1997 , @entity7 was able to acquire the number four aircraft to replace its aging @entity101 @entity11 under an @entity103 barter agreement with the @entity104			2
the @entity106 @entity105 has also tapped the @entity11 's capabilities to move aircraft and large components around the continent , including t - 38s for the @entity112 and v - 22s for the @entity114			2
