the cake was iced , the sandwiches made and the balloons blown up and hanging from the ceiling			2
all that was needed was the guests and with @entity6 the birthday boy , they were never going to be ordinary			1
the most important guest was his great - grandmother , the @entity8 , who could be seen perched in the back seat of her car as she was driven through the gates of @entity13 in @entity14 , and spent 50 minutes with her great - grandson			2
looking summery in a floral patterned dress and her trademark pearls with bright red lipsick , the @entity8 looked delighted to be attending - and even got her car to slow down as it drove past the cheering crowds that lined the route to the palace			0
arriving at around 11am , they spent an hour at the @entity8 ’s official residence and as they were inside the band of the @entity45 played a tuneful rendition of @entity47 in honour of @entity6 ’s big day			0
the little prince ’s doting grandfather @entity49 , who also missed prince @entity52 ’s first birthday as he and his then wife , princess @entity53 , were on tour in @entity55 , was also away , this time in @entity56 on official duties			2
but he looked delighted after being given a large cuddly toy red squirrel to take home to his grandson as he visited a @entity63 estate			0
the first guests to arrive were @entity30 ’s parents , @entity65 and @entity66 , who drove in through the palace gates shortly after 3pm in matching @entity68			1
doting : the @entity8 might have been left with a nanny on her first birthday but she made sure she saw her great - grandson not once but twice on his big day favourite cousin : the @entity73 were followed by @entity74 , reportedly @entity52 and @entity75 's favourite cousin , who arrived with her husband @entity76 and daughter @entity77 family : @entity74 was driven through the gates of @entity13 by her husband @entity80 and represented a rare day off from her stellar eventing career party time : as well as his uncle @entity75 , @entity6 's first birthday guest list also included his maternal uncle , @entity86 , who arrived wearing a pair of @entity88 it 's @entity90 ! @entity94 , herself a fan of a themed birthday bash , also arrived at @entity13 for @entity6 's first birthday party despite being thought to have organised the party , there was no hint as to whether @entity65 had brought along a few bits and bobs from @entity100 , her online partyware store , to make the afternoon go with a swing			1
shortly afterwards another of the godparents , @entity103 , arrived on foot clutching a large rectangular - shaped present , wrapped in brightly coloured paper			0
@entity108 , as he is known in royal circles , is one of @entity52 ’s most trusted and long - serving aides			0
although he recently retired from his role as principal private secretary to @entity52 , @entity30 and @entity75 , the former army officer was immediately re-appointed as @entity52 ’s ‘ @entity113 ’ , so trusted is his counsel			2
other godparents to arrive included @entity116 , one of @entity30 ’s closest friends from her days at @entity119 , and @entity120 , a childhood friend of the prince			1
@entity122 , a confidante of @entity52 ’s late mother , @entity53 , @entity53 , and another of @entity6 ’s god - parents , was also driven in by car			0
the brains of the operation : @entity129 , wearing a typically elegant polka dot tea dress , drives into the palace for the party she organised @entity132 's here : @entity66 arrived in a separate car from his wife			1
@entity6 spent his first few months at the @entity66 home in @entity137 heads turned as @entity30 ’s heavily - bearded brother , @entity86 , zipped in driving a £ 60,000 convertible f - type @entity140 , while @entity90 was dropped off in a black taxi			1
the @entity8 ’s grand - daughter and @entity52 ’s cousin , @entity145 , fresh from competing in an equestrian event on the continent , was among the last to arrive and drove in with her husband , @entity80			0
@entity74 laughed and smiled at the waiting crowds as they roared past			0
although she could not be seen , it is believed the couple ’s own baby daughter , @entity77 , was in the back of their car			0
according to palace sources , @entity156 prince @entity75 – sure to be the life and soul of even a children ’s tea party – strolled over from his cottage in the palace grounds to join in the fun			0
birthday visit : @entity166 of @entity167 was photographed driving @entity6 to @entity33 to visit the @entity8 this morning birthday : @entity6 has spent his first birthday with his parents , the @entity171 and @entity30 , and his great - grandmother , the @entity8 well - wishers left flags and balloons at the gates to @entity13			1
inside @entity6 , his parents , aunt and uncles were celebrating along with his @entity66 grandparents and his great - grandmother , the @entity8			1
in one of two new photographs issued , @entity6 can be seen pointing and gazing intently at the delicate creature which has landed on his father 's hand present for @entity6 : although @entity6 's grandparents @entity49 and the @entity189 were in @entity56 , @entity49 did pick up a toy squirrel for his grandson @entity166 of @entity167 and @entity6 watch princes @entity52 and @entity75 play polo at @entity193 , @entity194 , in june @entity166 of @entity167 holds her son ( left ) close while they watch prince william play polo and ( right ) at the @entity198 at @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 @entity166 of @entity167 holds @entity6 alongside prince @entity52 while meeting a @entity202 called @entity6 at @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 , in april doting : the family visited @entity199 in @entity200 in april during a state visit to @entity201 which was deemed a huge success @entity206 : @entity6 plays with toys during his visit to a nursery in @entity211 during the family 's state visit in april this year on his first public engagement in @entity211 back in april , @entity6 unwittingly managed to make a female playmate cry by snatching her toy from her @entity6 attend an event for @entity219 nurses and parents with their young children at @entity222 , as part of their tour of @entity211 and @entity201 eight - month - old @entity6 at his first official engagement at @entity222 , in @entity226 , @entity211 where he was given a teddy bear			1
