it has long been thought that , broadly speaking , there are two types of planet in the universe - terrestrial , rocky worlds like @entity6 , and gas giants like @entity8			1
but now remarkable research has , for the first time , suggested that some gas giants can transform into rocky worlds later in their lives - and it may even be possible for them to become habitable			1
if true , it would suggest our theories of habitable planet formation may need to be rewritten , and life may have even more of a chance of forming in the universe than we thought			2
researchers at the @entity23 studied mini-neptunes			1
they say some of the planets can migrate closer to their host star and become habitable ( illustration shown )			1
moving closer would subject them to more x-rays and radiation , in turn ejecting their gaseous atmosphere into space the research was carried out by @entity23 doctoral student @entity37 and research assistant professor dr @entity38			1
they focused on a particular type of gas giant known as a @entity42 , similar to other gas giants but only about 10 times @entity6 's mass. in particular , they considered those around @entity47 - stars which are smaller and dimmer than the sun , with close - in habitable zones			1
earlier this week scientists revealed a solar system with five @entity6 - sized planets has been discovered , which is so ancient it was born not long after the dawn of time			2
the system 's parent star , named @entity59 , is 117 light years from @entity6 and 11.2 billion years old			2
when the sun - like star was formed out of a primordial cloud of gas and dust , the universe was just a fifth of its current age			2
astronomers have shown that it hosts five planets with diameters ranging between those of @entity72 and @entity73			0
that makes them roughly the same size , or slightly smaller than @entity6			0
‘ we now know that @entity6 - sized planets have formed throughout most of the universe 's 13.8 billion year history , which could provide scope for the existence of ancient life in the @entity86 , ’ said dr @entity76 , from the @entity78 's @entity77			2
astronomers expect to find many @entity6 - like and ' super-earth ' planets in the habitable zones of these stars in coming years , so it ’s important to know if they might indeed support life			2
in these systems , @entity93 often form far from their host star , with ice molecules joining with hydrogen and helium gases in great quantities to form icy , rocky cores surrounded by massive gaseous atmospheres			1
' they are initially freezing cold , inhospitable worlds , ' mr @entity37 said			0
' but planets need not always remain in place			0
' the researchers say that tidal forces from the planet 's star could cause the planet to migrate closer to the centre of its planetary system			1
in the process , this can bring mini-neptunes into their host star 's habitable zone , where they are exposed to much higher levels of x-ray and ultraviolet radiation			1
what follows is a rapid loss of the atmospheric gases to space , possibly leaving behind a hydrogen - free , rocky world			1
the co-authors call such planets ' habitable evaporated cores			0
' ' such a planet is likely to have abundant surface water , since its core is rich in water ice , ' mr @entity37 said			0
he added that ' once in the habitable zone , this ice can melt and form oceans , ' perhaps leading to the formation of life			0
shown here is an illustration of the gas giants in the solar system			0
they are all thought to have a core of rock and ice at their centres			0
if the surrounding atmosphere was ejected , like in the @entity42 scenario described in this latest research , it could leave behind a terrestrial , habitable world the research focused on a particular type of gas giant known as a @entity42 , a type of planet that is similar to other gas giants but only about 10 times @entity6 's mass. it 's unknown if the resultant planet would be like @entity6 , left , or a super-earth , illustrated right dr @entity38 and mr @entity37 note that many other conditions would have to be met for such planets to be habitable			1
one is the development of an atmosphere right for creating and recycling nutrients globally			0
if hydrogen and helium loss is too slow while a planet is forming , a gaseous envelope would prevail and a rocky , terrestrial world may not form			1
if the world loses hydrogen too quickly , a runaway greenhouse state could result , with all water lost to space			0
' the bottom line is that this process - the transformation of a @entity42 into an earthlike world - could be a pathway to the formation of habitable worlds around m dwarf stars , ' mr @entity37 said			1
will they truly be habitable ? that remains for future research to learn , mr @entity37 added			0
most of the planets outside our solar system discovered to data have been found by @entity202 's @entity201 telescope , illustrated here			0
it was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets , and was recently repurposed for the new ' @entity208 ' mission after one of its reaction wheels failed			0

researchers at the @entity23 studied @entity93
they say some of the planets can migrate closer to their host star
this would would subject them to more x-rays and radiation
in turn this could eject their gaseous atmosphere into space
behind it would leave a rocky world - and the melting of the gas giant 's ices could make oceans on it abundant
the researchers say these types of planet could even become habitable
