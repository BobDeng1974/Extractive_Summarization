by @entity0 published : 23:01 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 02:39 est , 3 october 2012 whether you feel fat , thin , average or you simply do n't care may have nothing to do with the chocolate cake you ate yesterday			1
it may instead be down to the genes you inherited from your parents			2
a woman 's body image and desire to be thin stems chiefly from her genetic make - up , according to new research carried out at @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
mothers pass on their ' thin idealisation ' to their daughters , so @entity16 is likely to inherit @entity16 's fondness for the skinny leg , left , and @entity19 may enjoy working out like her mother @entity20 , right			2
scientists found that nearly half of the reason why some women feel more pressure to be slim is down to their ' genetic programming '			0
scientists found that nearly half of the reason why some women feel more pressure to be slim is down to their ' genetic programming ' , which causes some women to be more susceptible to body image issues and eating disorders			0
@entity34 , left , will probably have the same attitudes towards body shape as her mother , @entity38			0
so @entity16 is likely to inherit @entity16 's prediction for a tiny waist ; @entity34 could take after her mother @entity38 when it comes to staying toned and slim ; and @entity43 will probably follow her mother @entity20 into the gym			0
the research challenges the popular notion that young women are pressured into idolising thinness due to their environments , which are replete with airbrushed photos of celebrities and ' size zero ' models			0
scientists carried out the study by examining differing attitudes between identical and fraternal twins			1
lead researcher at @entity58 said : ' we 're all bombarded daily with messages extolling the virtues of being thin , yet intriguingly only some women develop what we term ' thin ideal internalisation			1
' this suggests that genetic factors may make some women more susceptible to this pressure than others			0
' the study - which is being published in the @entity71 - assessed more than 300 female twins from the @entity73 between the ages of 12 and 22			1
researchers measured how much the twins wanted to look like people from films , television and magazines			2
once the levels of their ' thin idealisation ' were assessed , identical twins ( who share 100 per cent of their genes ) were compared with fraternal twins ( who share 50 per cent , just like standard brothers and sisters )			1
identical twins @entity86 and @entity87 , left , would be likely to have the same ' thin idealisation ' because they share exactly the same genes , but it would probably differ to that of their younger sister @entity92 , right			1
the results showed that identical twins have closer levels of thin idealisation than fraternal twins - suggesting a ' significant ' role for genetics			1
this means that identical twins such as @entity86 and @entity87 are more likely to have the same attitudes towards body image and eating as each other , but will not necessarily share these attitudes with their younger sister , actress @entity92			2
further research put this figure at 43 per cent , meaning half of the reasons women differ in their idealisation of thinness can be explained by their genetic make - up			0
results did showed that environmental influences are also important , especially experiences not shared between twins			2
non-shared factors include one twin being involved in a weight - focused sport like dance , one twin observing more media that promotes thinness , or one twin having friends who place importance on weight			0
a woman 's unique dna dictates how she feels about her body - more so than environmental factors such as diet and the media			0
ms @entity58 added : ' we were surprised to find that shared environmental factors - such as exposure to the same media - did not have as big an impact as expected			0
' instead , non-shared factors that make co-twins different from each other had the greatest impact			0
' the broad cultural risk factors that we thought were most influential in the development of thin - ideal internalisation are not as important as genetic risk and environmental risk factors that are specific and unique to each twin			1
' @entity149 , professor of psychology at @entity12 and co-author of the study , said a broad range of factors can contribute to the development of eating disorders			2
she said : ' this study reveals the need to take a similar approach to the ways in which women buy in to pressure to be thin , by considering how both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of thin - ideal internalisation			1
