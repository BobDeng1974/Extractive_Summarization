a flickering rainbow of colours came with the march solar storm that made the @entity3 even more remarkable than usual , and @entity5 photographer @entity4 was in @entity6 to capture them in all their glory			1
@entity4 , 42 , who is based in @entity10 , led a group of her students to @entity13 and @entity14 in the south of @entity6 where they were fortunate enough to be blown away by what is said to have been the strongest geomagnetic storm in the current solar cycle			1
while @entity4 takes and edits all manner of photographs , she has a particular affinity with the night sky - and not just the spectacular @entity24 but locations in her own country too			1
' you can find amazing nightscapes almost everywhere , i started collecting night scenes near my home town and went always further and further trying to capture iconic places all around the world			2
' the @entity3 were one of my dreams , so i went some weeks ago to @entity6 hoping to be lucky enough to get one ! ' i have to say i have been so much more than just lucky , since i got one the most powerful solar storm in the last three years that made an incredibly @entity49 visible in @entity50 too ! ' @entity4 , the daughter of two artists , teaches photography and post-production in seminars all around @entity5 and is also the editor and founder of the photo community www.maxartis.i			1
not a bad view for the residents of this home near @entity14 where the @entity3 shone even brighter than usual last month @entity4 shot this stunning image of a man ( right ) admiring the sky over @entity64 in the @entity65 , @entity5 , and this pair ( right ) in @entity6 a man shines a torch but his light his overshadowed by the stars above @entity71 in @entity10 , @entity5 these stunning night skies were immortalised from @entity73 near in @entity74 in the @entity76 region of @entity5 @entity4 , the daughter of two artists , teaches photography and post-production in seminars all around @entity5 a keen photographer since she was six spending time in her father 's dark room , she still considers developing films and printing a form of ' magic ' to this day			1
but you are in control of some elements of the craft and there are ways to maximise your chances to capture something as wonderful as these examples , and a lot of it comes down to the location			2
' scouting places in your own country is definitely simpler than when you are abroad , ' she says			0
' in any case it is important to scout them during day time			0
it is extremely difficult discover a good place during night time , so usually i come back just before darkness in order to be able to frame the picture and studying the right composition			0
' another stunning shot from @entity71 in @entity10 , which @entity4 scouted out in daylight before returning before sundown to set - up a keen photographer since she was six spending time in her father 's dark room , she still considers photography a form of ' magic ' and patience is a virtue that can not be underestimated			1
' night photography is always tricky and full of issues to overcome ! it is difficult managing your gear in complete darkness and often you are in very lonely places where it is not so safe to stay			2
you can find dangerous wildlife or even people with bad intentions			0
you have to pay a lot of attention and be prepared to stay many hours at very low temperatures			0
' ' you need to scout a location with clear sky during a night rather with no moon			0
try to use a fast lenses ( f / 2.8 is better ) , a shutter speed between 8 and 15 sec ( it depends how fast the aurora moves ) and @entity146 between 1600 and 2500			0
