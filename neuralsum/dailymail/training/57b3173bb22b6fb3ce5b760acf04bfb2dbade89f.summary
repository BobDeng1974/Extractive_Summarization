by @entity1 reporter published : 01:58 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 03:47 est , 16 december 2013 a @entity3 family of evangelical @entity4 who came to the @entity5 in order to legally homeschool their children has appealed a ruling to deport them			1
@entity11 and @entity12 are the parents of six children who they wish to home school according their religious beliefs			1
home schooling is against the law in @entity3 , where all children must attend school			2
@entity21 ... denied : the @entity12 family , pictured here in front of @entity26 courthouse , fled @entity3 in order to continue homeschooling their children and were denied asylum in the @entity5 today the @entity30 fled @entity3 in 1998 after a @entity3 judge threatened legal action if they did n't send their children to school			1
they arrived in @entity34 and were initially granted asylum but the government sought to deport the family and an appeals court agreed that the freedom to determine the education of one 's children is not a fundamental human right			1
the administration also agreed with the @entity3 court 's finding that banning homeschooling teaches tolerance of diverse views			1
now the family has appealed that decision and is being represented by the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) in the @entity52			1
' we are pleased by the @entity52 's interest in the issues we have presented in our petition , ' @entity51 chairman @entity53 wrote in an email to @entity51 supporters , according to @entity60			2
' @entity61 gives the @entity52 an opportunity to address important religious freedom and human rights issues			2
we hope that after due consideration of the government 's brief they will agree to hear our case			2
' the @entity5 @entity52 has ordered the @entity71 administration to respond to the petition from the @entity51 but there is no guarantee the court will hear the @entity77 6th @entity76 earlier ruled that @entity5 immigration laws do not grant a safe haven to people everywhere who face restrictions that would be prohibited under the @entity82 and said said @entity11 and @entity12 and family do not qualify as ' persecuted , ' a prerequisite for asylum			1
school day : the @entity30 have six children and another on the way			2
they are seen here demonstrating how homeschooling works in their @entity90 , @entity34 home many @entity5 home - school families and evangelical christians have taken up the family 's cause			1
a group called the @entity51 helped the family 's petition to the @entity99 gain over 100,000 signatures in under 30 days			2
in 2008 , the @entity101 moved from @entity102 an der @entity104 in the state of @entity106 to @entity90 in eastern @entity34 and applied for asylum			0
they faced fines and the threat of losing custody of their children because they refused to comply with @entity3 's compulsory school attendance law			2
that request was initially granted by an immigration judge in 2010			0
but the @entity117 overturned that ruling and the @entity30 appealed to the @entity119			1
' the question is not whether @entity3 's policy violates the @entity82 , whether it violates the parameters of an international treaty or whether @entity3 's law is a good idea			2
it is whether the @entity101 have established the prerequisites of an asylum claim - a well - founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground , ' the court wrote			0
' in this case , that protected ground is religious freedom			0
' but the court found that the @entity3 government treats all truants the same , regardless of their reasons for not attending school			1
prior to fleeing the country for @entity5 , the @entity30 had accrued $ 9,000 in fines for not having their children in a required school			1
criminal charges also await them if and when they are deported to @entity3			0
the @entity51 , which represented the @entity30 in court , has made a short video posted to its website that shows the @entity30 ' six children studying together at a big table and chasing chickens in the yard			1
danger : their native @entity3 does not allow children to be home - schooled and allows the revocation of custody in some cases focus on the @entity101 : the family appeared on @entity162 's @entity161			1
they became a favorite cause of may conservatives in recent weeks @entity166 , director of international relations for the association , said the @entity30 planned to appeal			0
' the court ignored the evidence that @entity3 targets people for religious or philosophical reasons , ' @entity166 said , referring to a 2003 @entity3 @entity52 decision that found the compulsory attendance law served a legitimate government interest of counteracting the development of parallel societies			1
the @entity119 considered this argument but dismissed it , stating , ' any compulsory - attendance law could be said to have this effect			0
' in an april statement , @entity51 called the @entity71 administration hypocritical for its denial of asylum for the @entity30			0
' the public expects the @entity186 to explain the inexplicable , ' said the @entity51 's @entity53			0
' in a season where the @entity189 has expressed leniency for millions of undocumented immigrants , we are baffled by the extreme attitudes toward this one @entity3 family			2
' witchcraft : @entity195 , 9 , left			0
and @entity196 , 10 , right , are taught by father @entity11			0
part of why @entity11 wants his children out of school is that he believes they teach children witchcraft spooky : @entity12 , described an incident in her seventh grade class where the school taught witchcraft in ' an excercise that involved pushing chairs and glasses around , and dangling a pendulum ' in the petition filed by @entity51 , the organization argued ' every state in the @entity5 recognizes the right to homeschool and the @entity5 has the world â€™s largest and most vibrant homeschool community			1
regrettably , this family faces deportation in spite of the persecution they will suffer in @entity3			1
' professor @entity222 of the @entity223 played the devil 's advocate last month on @entity161 when he argued that homeschooling is n't a basic human right , and that the @entity12 family is n't entitled to stay in the @entity5			1
' @entity229 may be a good idea			0
it may be a bad idea			0
it 's a public policy question , ' @entity222 said			0
' not having homeschooling is not being persecuted			0
' ' they are not getting something they would like , ' he insisted			0
' that 's true for people everywhere , and that 's why we have legislatures			0
' popular : claiming persecution in @entity3 , the @entity30 petitioned the @entity186 and received over 100,000 online signatures , but that did n't sway the circuit court 's interpretation of asylum law not persecuted : professor @entity222 from the @entity223 ( @entity252 ) agreed that family is n't entitled to political asylum just because the @entity3 government has criminalized homeschooling the @entity5 government said in court documents the @entity30 did not belong to any particular @entity260 denomination and described the parents ' objections to the government - approved schools as vague			1
for instance , @entity265 claimed a textbook ' featured a story suggesting that " the devil can help you if you ask the devil , but @entity272 would not help you , " ' the government said			2
but he could not recall the title of the story or its author			0
@entity12 also claimed the schools taught witchcraft based on a game played by classmates of his wife when she was in the seventh grade ' that involved pushing chairs and glasses around , and dangling a pendulum			1
' fighting : @entity12 supervises one of her daughters during a home - schooling session			0
the @entity30 are say they plan to appeal today 's @entity76 decision to deny them asylum			0

the government sought to deport @entity11 and @entity12 and their six children
the family wants to stay in the @entity5 because homeschooling is not legal in @entity3
an appeals court agreed with the government that they are not facing persecution
the @entity30 have appealed the ruling to deport them
the @entity52 has ordered the government to respond to the petition but there is no guarantee the case will be heard
@entity265 believes public schools teach ' witchcraft '
