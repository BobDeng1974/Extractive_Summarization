by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 11:42 est , 4 september 2012 at first glance , they look uncannily like a gallery of moody , hipster black and white pictures uploaded to the retro photo sharing site instagram			0
in fact , they are a collection of ' raw ' images from @entity11 's @entity10 on the surface of @entity13			1
the unprocessed images have a grainy quality , due to the ' hidden ' colour information within them - which is not revealed until they are processed by @entity11			1
a ' raw ' image from the @entity13 surface taken by the mastcam , a 2 megapixel camera on curiosity 's mast			1
it may look like a mono image , but in fact has colour information encoded within it , giving it a grainy quality rather like an instagram picture the same image , but processed to reveal the colour			2
online enthusiasts were able to extract the colour information from the raw image			1
the image can then be processed to alter its colour and make it look more presentable			0
here , a final image has been created showing the martian landscape in colour			2
each @entity42 uses a filtered camera sensor to capture images			0
known as a @entity46 , it provides nearly true color views - that is , similar to what the human eye would see on @entity13			0
using this approach eliminates the usual need for planetary spacecraft cameras to take 3 separate images - one through a red filter , one through a green filter , and one through a blue filter			2
the ccd captures the image using the pattern below : while @entity11 only generally publicises ' hero ' images that show off stunning new features or amazing colour panoramas , it has also quietly been publishing every single image from the rover 's multiple cameras online , giving a far more accurate view of the red planet - which , it seems , it actually a rather dull place - until the colour information is extracted			1
although @entity11 does not publish details of how it encodes the images , online enthusiasts at @entity77 have worked it out , and are busy decoding images			2
these images are taken by @entity80 , and are usually used by engineers and drivers on @entity83 to check the rover is going in the right direction			0
@entity86 of the @entity87 explains that many of the images we see from @entity13 use false colours to highlight key areas			0
' true colour images are fairly rare , and as anyone who has looked at @entity13 through a telescope knows , it is an orangey red colour , ' he said			0
' however , there really is n't a huge diversity of colour there - and it really resembles a barren desert , and a very harsh environment ' they are also used to look for potential sites for the rover to investigate			1
one of the two @entity42 camera systems has a moderate - resolution lens , while the other camera system has a high - resolution lens in order to study the landscape far from the rover			0
in fact , even @entity10 's high resolution camera is poor compared to modern cameras and even phones			1
a two megapixel unit , it was chosen to permit @entity10 to store and transmit images in good time			2
curiosity sends data to two satellites currently orbiting @entity13 -- the former @entity125 and @entity126 orbiters -- which then transmit data back to @entity83			0
but at a speed of only @entity131 , it 's still quite slow in modern terms - and explains the grainy , retro pictures sent back			0
as well as the retro images , @entity10 also sends back small ' thumbnail ' images , often in basic , unencoded colour , which show engineers what the camera is focused on before they decide whether to take a higher resolution photo			2
a thumbnail images showing a closeup of a rock on @entity13 the low res images ( shown here at their full size ) are used to check camera positions images uploaded today show the camera focusing on nearby rocks			0
hipsters on @entity13 : @entity10 's latest images may lack the high resolution of its pr shots , but they give the red planet a decidedly retro feel			1
the images also reveal fascinating rocks on the martian surface , including this triangular one dubbed ' shark rock ' the images , all taken from @entity10 's mastcam , are used by engineers to study the rover 's surroundings as it moves around the red planet			1
@entity11 provides no information about images , but does claim to publish every single picture from the red planet of a special curiosity images feed			1
the low resolution pictures have a grainy quality probably caused by martian dust , and slight distortion at the edges due to the relatively low quality lenses on the rover			0
the images reveal the sweeping beauty of the @entity13 surface , but also help controllers look for possible areas for @entity10 to go and visit .			1

images are from @entity11 's ' live feed ' of every raw image taken by @entity10
taken using its mast cameras , the images reveal a landscape likened to a ' barren desert '
