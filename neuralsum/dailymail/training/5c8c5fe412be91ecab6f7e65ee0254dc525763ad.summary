by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 believes future generations of @entity6 players could benefit from pursuing their club careers abroad			1
@entity9 's @entity8 agreed a season - long loan with @entity12 side @entity11 this week and @entity3 is convinced it is in the interests of more young stars to consider a future on the continent			2
@entity3 told thefa.com : ' we are going to have to accept that some young players - who i think are good enough and can win games for @entity6 - will not always be first choice for their teams in @entity6			1
most of our players , although they do n't all play regularly - play at very good clubs at a very high level			0
' he added : ' if you are asking me would it be better for some of our players to be playing in good teams abroad rather than warming the bench , then of course as a national team manager i would like to see that			0
' the then @entity47 goalkeeper @entity46 was the only member of @entity6 's final 23 - man squad for the @entity49 to be based outside the @entity50			1
previously , @entity51 and @entity52 - who were based at @entity53 and @entity54 respectively - were picked for the 2006 squad from abroad			0
loan : @entity9 's @entity8 has moved to @entity12 side @entity11 on loan for the season @entity49 : in 2006 both @entity51 and @entity52 were playing abroad and in @entity6 's squad but @entity3 is hopeful that the move by @entity26 midfielder @entity8 could be the start of a trend which sees young prospects pick regular first team football abroad over often bit - part roles at home			1
@entity3 added : ' it is not my job to tell players what to do but i would think that , if the opening was there for players to go abroad , then a lot of them would take it			2
' @entity9 have a lot of young players and they send them to @entity11			0
@entity80 have a lot of farm clubs			0
' but @entity3 appeared to concede that the introduction of some kind of quota system which restricts the number of foreign players available to each top - flight club is likely to be a non-starter			0
@entity3 added : ' national team managers would welcome anything that would protect their players from foreign player invasion but whether the @entity50 or the @entity94 will bring in rules that restrict foreigners then i 'm not sure			2
' abroad : in @entity6 's @entity49 squad @entity3 only had one foreign - based player - @entity47 's @entity46 it ’s not too late to play @entity101 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			1

@entity3 believes young players could benefit from moving abroad
@entity6 's @entity49 squad only had one non @entity50 player
@entity3 says playing abroad *preferable* to being a sub in @entity50
