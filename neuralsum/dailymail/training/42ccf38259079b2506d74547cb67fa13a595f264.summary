by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the fighter for whom @entity3 was so unceremoniously dumped by @entity4 believes his elevation to next month ’s money fight has spared the boxing public a night of expensive tedium			1
@entity9 , not content with having gate - crashed @entity3 ’s party , has added insult to the @entity13 ’s wounded pride by saying : ‘ if @entity3 had got this fight it would have been very boring			1
’ since the one thing @entity3 has never been accused of is being unexciting , that requires explanation			1
when pressed @entity9 adds : ‘ both he and @entity4 are pure boxers			1
so , unlike me , neither of them would go on the attack			2
he is talking styles and says : ‘ @entity3 was one of the biggest fights of my career and also one of the toughest in my life			1
he ’s a very good boxer			2
’ so good that four years ago in @entity32 he staved off @entity9 ’s challenge for the world light welterweight title he held at the time despite being caught by one of the massive punches which have given the @entity35 31 knockouts in his 35 wins			1
despite his reputation for having a suspect chin , @entity3 survived that blow and several more big shots in that late round to take a unanimous decision			1
now he has lost to @entity9 his may 3 date in @entity32 with @entity4			1
not only that , he has to accept appearing on the undercard at the @entity64 in a non-title fight against the awkward former champion @entity66			2
not that @entity9 is bothered about that , even though he admitted he was surprised to be a late choice for @entity4 , saying : ‘ like everyone else i thought @entity3 had it			1
’ as we talked , hours before @entity72 ’s brilliant righting of that wrong decision against @entity74 , his concern was with how to deal with the no 1 pound - for - pound boxer in the world			1
where @entity3 is lightning fast , the perceived wisdom is that @entity9 is not quick enough to seriously trouble @entity4			1
to which he says : ‘ we ’re working on speed every day and i ’m getting quicker			1
but it ’s not all about that			2
i ’m also training harder than ever before so i can keep the pressure on @entity4			1
i have that one - punch ko power in both hands but i wo n’t only be going for the head			2
‘ most of @entity4 ’s opponents have done that but his defence is so good			1
i will be putting some of my power into a lot more body shots than he usually gets			0
’ putting his money where his mouth is : @entity4 chose to face @entity9 rather than @entity3 on may 3 also , as the underdog , he will ignore the ridicule he expects to come his way from the @entity4 camp , saying : ‘ i ’m prepared to put up with them laughing at us			1
as we did before beating @entity104			0
’ it was that upset victory over @entity104 which enabled @entity4 to deny @entity3 his promised opportunity and bring in the more orthodox @entity9			1
but the man called @entity109 recalls how @entity4 took more punches from @entity111 in their recent fight and says : ‘ it looked as if at his age ( 37 ) @entity4 might be slowing just a little			1
@entity111 caught him a lot and i have more power than him			0
i ’ll be throwing a lot of punches , like against @entity104			0
i will catch @entity4 at some point and when i do i will finish him			2
’ is he oblivious to the 10 - 1 odds currently against him the casinos on the @entity32 ? ‘ i like being the underdog , ’ he says			0
‘ i know it will be a very difficult fight but i enjoy to give surprises			0
’ he is also fighting for his nation			0
much of the conversation revolved around @entity127 , the greatest of all @entity35 fighters , @entity129 and @entity130			2
national heroes : boxer @entity127 and footballers @entity130 ( below left ) and @entity129 ( below right ) are revered in @entity35 @entity9 says : ‘ they are all great heroes in my country			1
people talk about them all the time , me included			0
‘ but now i ’m fighting for the pride of @entity35 and when i beat @entity4 it will be an historic victory for my country			1
’ for the moment , at least , that is an opportunity being denied @entity3			2
even in the hardest game there is room for humour			0
@entity74 , shortly before saturday ’s thrilling re-match with @entity72 , declared that his mobility had been restricted by foot injuries in their first fight in which he was given that controversial decision			2
and he blamed it on not wearing socks			2
socks symbol : @entity74 in training before his defeat by @entity72 at the weekend @entity157 , the @entity72 ’s fabled trainer , could not @entity156 sent @entity74 a box of socks and a letter which , including the deliberate misspellings , read : ‘ is it really your feetal position that these injuries occurred because you did not wear socks ? ‘ though many members of the media think this excuse sounds like a hose job , i for one do believe you			1
to me you are boxing ’s no 1 sox symbol			0
‘ think of me as your sole supporter			0
i hope the enclosed gift helps with the heeling process			0
’ @entity74 , gentleman that he is , took in good part			2
heeling process : @entity157 sent this light - hearted letter to @entity74 after the @entity26 's complaints saturday brings @entity181 ’s chance to reclaim some of the super-bantamweight limelight , following @entity185 ’s ko victory in a world title eliminator			1
@entity181 , already the @entity187 ‘ regular ’ world champion , defends that title against @entity191 title holder @entity189			0
once both he and @entity185 have alpha - belts around their waists , the stage will surely be set for another @entity195			0
@entity181 v @entity189 will be live on @entity196 on saturday night			0
@entity197 continues to defy the laws of nature			0
on saturday night , at the age of 49 and already the oldest world champion , he hopes to break the age record for unifying titles			0
@entity197 , the @entity204 light - heayweight champion , takes on @entity206 ’s @entity205 , the @entity187 belt holder in @entity208			0
@entity209 back the years : @entity197 in training as he tries to become the oldest fighter to unify titles a 55th victory in 62 fights will propel him on beyond 50 to even bigger fights			0
as he says : ‘ i ’m always making history now			0
’ in truth he has never been the most exciting fighter to watch – but catch him while you can			0
@entity220 will be live on @entity221 on saturday night .			0
