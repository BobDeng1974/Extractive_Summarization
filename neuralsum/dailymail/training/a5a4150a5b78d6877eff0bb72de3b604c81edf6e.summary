one very lucky cat is getting a new lease on life thanks to the kind folks at a local hospital			2
@entity5 , a 37 - pound cat whose owner wanted to have him euthanized , has been adopted by the doctors at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , who are now focusing on getting the cat healthy once again			1
a normal cat , she explained , weighs around 12 pounds			0
@entity5 's former owner was frequently working and , not wanting her precious feline to want for anything while she was away , she overfed the cat , leading to @entity5 's current obesity problem			2
the cat has trouble breathing , is constipated and , even worse , does not purr or meow , which is a sign of stress			1
he is also in so much pain he requires painkillers			0
nursing him back to health : the staff if hoping that with exercise and a diet high in protein , @entity5 can get healthy backed up : as seen in this x-ray , the cat is also extremely constipated that being said , dr. @entity19 says the cat moves remarkably well given his weight issues and , with a new diet that is heavy on protein and some serious exercise , she is hoping to save @entity5 's life			1
it will however be an uphill battle , as most cats who weigh over 30 pounds are never able to bounce back			0
here 's hoping @entity5 can prove them all wrong .			0
