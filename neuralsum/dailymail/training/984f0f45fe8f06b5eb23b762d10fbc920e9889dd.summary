@entity2 's under pressure power grid could struggle to cope if growing numbers of electric car owners all recharge their batteries when they sit down for dinner , the industry said today			1
the warning comes after @entity2 car - maker @entity8 launched its long - awaited electric car @entity10 this month at a price on a par with petrol models , making it the first electric vehicle with mass - market potential			1
the government , meanwhile , has been encouraging the technology with generous subsidies			1
but this comes in a country with a power grid that is already extremely sensitive to spikes in demand because of its high reliance on electric heating			1
power bosses have warned of the effect of an increasing number of people using electric cars after the @entity10 , the first with mass market potential , was launched though the prospect of a fleet of hundreds of thousands of electric cars remains some distance off , @entity2 needs to consider how it will cope when cold winter evenings prompt households to turn on the heaters , lights and electric gadgets at the same time			1
@entity41 , head of r&d at @entity2 power grid @entity43 , said : ' if it 's badly managed , it could prompt power surges , which would cost a lot in peak production , co2 emissions and would also necessitate the construction of relatively costly infrastructure			1
' @entity41 said that under the ' ambitious ' scenario of a fleet of two million electric vehicles by 2020 , total @entity2 annual electricity consumption would rise by 1 to 3 per cent			1
' it 's not huge in terms of energy , ' @entity41 said			0
' but if all these vehicles charge at peak times , even with slow car chargers , it could add between 3 and 6 gigawatts ( @entity63 ) of peak demand , which would be felt if it comes at the wrong moment			2
' data last year from @entity70 eco-town @entity68 , in @entity66 , showed that owners of electric cars typically plugged in their vehicles when home electricity use spiked , causing potential problems for the grid			1
the heavy reliance on electrical heating in @entity2 was instigated by successive governments to absorb surplus nuclear power			1
its 19 nuclear power plants make @entity2 @entity84 's biggest electricity exporter and ensure generally steady power supplies			2
however , it lacks flexible capacity - usually generated by gas , coal or oil - fired plants - to meet peak evening demand during cold snaps			2
under pressure : electric pylons which are part of the grid in @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity2 @entity8 's decision not to provide chargers compatible with home sockets , thereby requiring @entity10 owners to buy ' @entity104 ' chargers , could soften the impact			1
peak demand has hit record highs in each of the past 10 winters			2
in february last year demand at one point hit more than 102 @entity63 and pushed the network to its limits , obliging @entity2 to import a record 9 @entity63			1
@entity43 and other state agencies identified the problem in a 2011 report and recommended car chargers that take up to eight hours to recharge a vehicle			0
though quick chargers do the job in about 30 minutes , these draw more energy than a dozen electric hot - water heaters			0
there is also the problem of a geographical concentration of cars drawing power from quick chargers ; at supermarkets , motorway service stations or business districts , for instance			0
' the issue is not the total number of vehicles , it 's how they will spread - and we think they will spread in clusters , ' said @entity139 , @entity140 vice-president at @entity2 engineering company @entity141			2
' you can have only 1,000 cars , ( but ) if 500 of these are connected to the same building , you 'll have a problem with this building and the neighbourhood around it , ' he said			0
' the issue is not the total number of vehicles , it 's how they will spread - and we think they will spread in clusters			0
' @entity141 's vice-president the key could be off - peak charging via ' smart grids ' able to communicate with chargers that can then be operated remotely			0
' there could be a problem , if we 're not careful , in terms of peak capacity , ' said @entity164 , in charge of the electric vehicle programme at @entity167 , the electric distribution arm of state - owned utility @entity167			0
' that 's why smart charging is necessary			0
' @entity2 industry minister @entity172 , the first @entity8 client to be handed the keys of a @entity10 , has appointed a committee to advise on the expansion of the charger network			1
@entity8 's decision not to provide chargers compatible with home sockets , thereby requiring @entity10 owners to buy ' @entity104 ' chargers , could soften the impact			2
in @entity183 , @entity8 will subsidise the cost when the car is launched there in june			1
the partly state - owned carmaker says owners could also use smartphone apps to set charging times depending on power prices			0
' if it is developed well , in a coordinated way , it is n't a problem and could even help to rebalance a network , especially by integrating more renewable energy , ' @entity43 's @entity41 said			0
electric cars ' batteries could smooth the variability of wind and solar energy by storing wind power produced at night and injecting it back to the grid when it needs help , he said			2
such vehicle - to - grid systems are already being tested in the @entity70 and @entity207			0
@entity141 's @entity139 said @entity2 has domestic industrial players in each of the necessary fields of expertise , but the government needs a strong hand to ensure an integrated approach			1
' you do n't need to work with 10,000 players , but five or 10 who are leaders in their field			0
however , that raises the issue of the big players ' egos , ' @entity139 said .			0

warning comes after @entity8 launched electric car with mass potential
government has been encouraging technology with generous subsidies
