with the trademark curly hair and giant personality , it is difficult for @entity3 to blend into the background			1
the uninformed supporter still stops the @entity7 prop in the street to commiserate with him on his country ’s latest defeat , unaware that he is no longer in the squad			2
@entity3 has been a household feature in @entity14 teams over the last decade and is one of the most recognisable and popular figures to wear the dragon red jersey			1
the 33 - year - old has experienced some tough autumn evenings at the @entity20 , but none quite as difficult as this november , having been left out of the squad for the first time in his career			1
@entity27 ( left ) , @entity3 ( centre ) and @entity26 sing the @entity7 national anthem @entity14 coach @entity29 has opted for young prop @entity30 over veteran tighhead @entity3 @entity3 ( right ) moved to the @entity31 from the @entity32 during the summer the frontrower admits it has been ‘ tough ’ and ‘ odd ’ as an outsider looking in , but has still not given up hope of making next year ’s @entity37 squad , even if it is just to avoid those awkward moments in the supermarket			1
‘ someone ’s wife came up to me in @entity43 and said “ unlucky at the weekend , you almost beat ‘ em " , ' said @entity3			1
‘ then the bloke nudged her and said “ he was n’t playing , he was n’t picked ! ” it ’s happened a couple of times ; people assume i was there because i ’ve been involved for such a long time			2
i guess i ’m quite recognisable with the hair and that			2
that ’s been the hardest bit			2
i always had a good rapport but i have n’t given up on the dream quite yet			0
’ a summer move from the @entity32 to @entity31 has given the forward renewed hope			1
@entity3 was caught in the crossfire of the funding row between the @entity62 and the @entity63 , which has now been resolved , and found himself unemployed and without a club when he returned from the summer tour to @entity66			1
@entity3 ( left ) and @entity14 captain @entity67 catch a breather against @entity69 in @entity70 in february 2013 he turned to his first club @entity71 , who he joined in 2000 as a part - time labourer making patio slabs			1
they invited the @entity76 to join their pre-season training and , after coming close to hanging up his boots , @entity3 was offered an alluring opportunity with the @entity31			1
‘ i ’d be lying if i said i did n’t fancy knocking it on the head and saying , “ f * * * it , i ’ll just go to university or something ” , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i missed the day - to - day camaraderie of being in a team ; all the chopping and the p * * * taking			2
you become pretty used to something when you ’ve been doing it for 14 or so years			0
‘ not having an income was a bit of a ball ache too , but i ’d been pretty thrifty so i always had a bit saved up			0
it dragged on for months but i was always thought in the back of my head that i still had something to offer			0
then @entity70 came in on the sunday and it was all done by tuesday			0
the whole thing made me realise how important rugby was to me			0
i ’d have been pretty dumb to pack it all in			0
’ @entity3 and fellow front row veteran @entity102 ( left ) celebrate with the 2013 @entity104 title a lack of fitness was @entity29 ’s reason for substituting @entity3 32 minutes into his milestone 100th test against @entity66 at @entity109 in june			1
@entity3 was left out of the squad for the second test altogether and he has not played for his country since			1
it harked back to 2003 , when @entity3 became known as the ’ 30 - minute man ’ after he was hauled off by @entity115 early in the @entity37 quarter - final in @entity117 against @entity118 , but the latest episode was more painful			1
for a player who was being courted for interviews all week ahead of the @entity123 in @entity124 , it was a huge crash down to earth			0
‘ it was my 100th test match so to go from such a high to getting hauled off was n’t nice , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i ’m not going to lie , the last week out there was hard work			0
i ’m not sure how i would have coped without @entity26 [ the veteran second row ]			0
i ’m probably still bitter about it now but it ’s happened			0
@entity3 , speaking to the media during the 2013 @entity134 tour of @entity135 , has always been a popular figure ‘ it was harder this time than in 2003 , because i ’m so much further down the line			2
i ’ve got to a certain standing and achieved things , so it hurt more			0
when i was younger it happened and i just had to suck it and see			0
but i understand that @entity144 and these guys get paid to make these big decisions and they have to do what works for them			0
’ @entity29 turned to 21 year - old @entity30 , who is regarded as @entity3 ’ long - term successor			1
the @entity151 prop has started every test since @entity3 was ousted and has the seal of approval from the man himself			2
‘ @entity30 is excellent , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ he ’s been phenomenal for his club and i think we ’ve got a little gem there			0
guys like him and @entity161 will be around for the next 10 years now and i think @entity30 will be a shoo in for the @entity134			2
he ’s a tough little f * * * * * and does n’t give a s * * * about reputations			0
he ’s someone we can build our team around over the next 10 years			0
’ @entity30 may be the future , but @entity3 is not ready to consign himself to the past			1
