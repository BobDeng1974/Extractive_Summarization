the 18 - year - old student 's body was found in marshland three months later			1
an inquest at @entity17 heard that she might have fallen from a bridge into the @entity20			1
@entity6 vanished from her parents ' house in @entity9 , @entity10 , last december after an argument over ' cultural differences ' @entity6 's disappearance sparked a nationwide search with her sister @entity26 ( left ) and mother @entity26 ( right ) issuing an appeal for information however , with no confirmed sightings after she disappeared and a post-mortem examination revealing no sign of injuries , and the circumstances surrounding her death remain a mystery			1
the coroner heard how @entity38 - born miss @entity6 had been a ' straight grade a student ' who wanted to go to university			1
but because her family 's asylum claim had been turned down - and they would not be able to afford her tuition fees - her degree dreams lay in tatters			1
father @entity45 was in the front room with his grandson on december 28 last year when his daughter suddenly got up and walked out at around 7.10pm			2
in a statement read aloud at the hearing , he said : ' there was a disagreement over cultural matters that evening			0
' @entity6 was sat downstairs with me and her nephew when suddenly without warning she got up and left the room			2
' as she was not wearing winter clothes or any footwear i thought she must have gone to put something in the bin outside			0
@entity6 's father @entity45 told the inquest there was a ' disagreement over cultural matters ' on the night of her disappearance ' but when she did not return i became anxious			1
' mortorised wheelchair user mr @entity45 , who sat through the inquest with his young grandson on his lap , then called up to miss @entity6 's sister and brother to go and look for their sibling			2
after his family had searched nearby streets for an hour , he went to @entity77 police station as well as the @entity78 in the hope of tracing her - but to no avail			2
' i have had no contact with my daughter since she left the house on december 28 , ' he said			2
' i can not explain why she left the house			2
the family disagreement would not have been the reason			0
' earlier in the year she had been upset over her inability to pursue her chosen education at university			0
' her disappearance is a complete mystery			0
' but despite several emotional public appeals for @entity97 to return home , nothing was seen of her until march 27 - when a group of litter - pickers discovered a badly decomposed body on marshland four miles away from @entity103			2
the coroner heard how @entity38 - born @entity97 ( pictured ) had been a ' straight grade a student ' who wanted to go to university it was later identified by dental records as being miss @entity6			1
detective constable @entity110 said that , despite numerous appeals for information , no credible sightings of the teenager were ever made			0
he added that her disappearance had also been ' totally out of character '			0
following the discovery of miss @entity6 's body , rivers and tidal expert dr @entity116 helped police with their investigation			1
the inquest heard that , on the night of ms @entity6 's disappearance , the @entity20 had been placed on flood alert - and the nearest access point from @entity103 was @entity127			1
he said : ' it is not possible to determine when , where or how miss @entity6 's body ended up in the water			1
' it is possible however to conclude that entry occurred into the @entity20 from the vicinity of the @entity127			0
' the natural forces of wind , wave and tides all would have been sufficient to transport the body from start to finish			0
' miss @entity6 's claim for asylum was turned down , the inquest heard , meaning they would not be able to afford her tuition fees leaving her degree dreams in tatters @entity151 dr @entity150 said his post-mortem examination into miss @entity6 's death had been ' hampered by decomposition '			1
however , he found no evidence of any injuries to her body nor anything which suggested she had been tied up or suffered a fall from a height			0
he said : ' it is not possible from the pathology to say how miss @entity6 died , but i have found no evidence to suggest she had been assaulted prior to her death			2
' but i am not able to ascertain the medical cause of of @entity6 's death			1
' recording an open verdict , coroner @entity168 said : ' police investigations failed to find any evidence as to when , how or in what manner @entity97 ’s body entered the river			0
' how this happened is pure speculation			0
and this inquest is not concerned with speculation , it is concerned with the facts			0
' @entity97 ’s father described his daughter ’s disappearance as a mystery			0
from the evidence that i have heard i am satisfied never has such a description been more appropriate			0
