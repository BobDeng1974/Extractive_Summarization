last week , singer @entity0 , 52 , revealed she was diagnosed with @entity1 's a year ago when @entity3 's children were young , she longed to join in the chats with other mothers at toddler group coffee mornings , but always felt like an outsider			1
' i desperately wanted to be part of the group , but i never seemed to say the right thing and i 'd get funny looks from people , ' says @entity3 , 42 , a school cleaner who lives in @entity16 , @entity17 , with her son @entity18 , 15 , and daughter @entity19 , 14			1
' i just do n't pick up on social niceties at all , ' she adds			2
@entity3 has often been criticised for being rude or blunt , although she never intends to be , and the criticism upsets her greatly			1
' when i was a teenager i remember a friend asking me what i thought of her new make - up			2
she obviously thought she looked great , but i said she looked like she 'd upset a paint box all over her face			2
everyone else just stared at me in disbelief			0
' @entity3 had friends ' but found the reality of having to make conversation stressful , and i 'd long to go home and be alone '			1
meanwhile , teachers would scold her for not making eye contact			0
' i could mask my personality traits by copying the behaviour of others , but i just did n't pick up the cues for what was appropriate ; it required huge effort , ' recalls @entity3			1
as well as her lack of social skills , @entity3 's hobbies set her apart			1
while most of her friends plastered their walls with pop star posters , she was obsessed with maps , and stuck her collection of 30 or so all around her bed			0
then , five years ago in her late 30s , @entity3 discovered the cause of her quirky behaviour traits			1
she has @entity1 's syndrome , sometimes referred to as a ' mild ' form of autism			1
autism is a spectrum disorder affecting how a person makes sense of the world , processes information and relates to other people			0
at one end of the spectrum , some with @entity1 's can often hold down jobs , marry and - on the surface , at least - live a normal life			1
but their symptoms can still cause a lot of distress , with problems in relationships and at school and work			0
there are around 700,000 people on the autism spectrum in @entity79 , according to @entity80 , with more being diagnosed			2
@entity1 's is much more common in men , although experts are beginning to wonder if this is simply because the symptoms are harder to recognise in women			1
@entity86 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , has also been diagnosed with @entity1 's syndrome last week , singer @entity0 , 52 , revealed she was diagnosed with @entity1 's a year ago			1
for years she 'd thought her difficulties - she was nicknamed ' @entity89 ' at school - had been caused by complications at birth			1
she 'd also suffered from anxiety around strangers and struggled with eye contact , making her feel ' different ' and ' an outsider ' throughout her childhood			0
in fact , these were signs of @entity1 's			1
' many people with @entity1 's want to be sociable , but have difficulties making friends and struggle to maintain them , ' explains dr @entity104 , of the @entity80			1
' they do n't understand the unwritten social rules and can appear aloof or behave inappropriately			0
this can make them depressed and cause them to withdraw			0
' the condition is ' particularly difficult ' to diagnose in females because they are much better at masking their symptoms than males , says dr @entity104			0
' they know they are different , but still want to fit in and make friends , and so will learn how to " act " in social situations			0
men can do this , too , but they do n't care as much about fitting in and do n't tend to need to be as sociable as women			2
' girls also tend to be more passive than boys with @entity1 's , who are usually more aggressive			1
consequently , it 's easier to detect it in boys			2
' the strain of trying to work out how to behave and interact can make women anxious , and this can often be misdiagnosed as depression or they will develop an eating disorder			0
they may obsess about counting every calorie , for example , or how much exercise they can do			0
' developing obsessional interests is another common @entity1 's trait			1
' girls might , for instance , develop an obsession with a celebrity , a soap opera , horses or @entity147 dolls , ' says dr @entity104			0
' what will stand out , though , is the intensity of that interest or the rituals of how their collections will be displayed			0
perfectionism is another common trait			0
and a love of strict routines			0
' what causes it is not clear , though research using @entity163 brain scans has shown differences in specific areas of the brains of children who have @entity1 's , including the frontal lobe which controls our ability to control and moderate our behaviour			1
the condition is ' more difficult ' to diagnose in females because they are much better at masking symptoms @entity1 's was formally recognised by the @entity176 as a distinct condition only in 1994			1
therefore , many adults , such as @entity0 and @entity3 , are only just now getting a diagnosis			1
' there are various red flags that an experienced clinician will pick up on , such as a lack of interest in people in childhood , ' says dr @entity104			0
most of those with @entity1 's have average or above - average intelligence			1
but typically , girls with @entity1 's will underachieve at school unless a teacher nurtures them , says dr @entity104			1
' they have intelligence , but not social intelligence : they do n't pick up on the whole picture			0
' many will go on to struggle in a work situation because , although they can focus on the job , they ca n't do the social chit - chat which can help them fit in and get on			0
' after leaving school @entity3 worked at a care home , and although she loved the routine , she found getting on with her colleagues difficult			1
' it baffled me - i just did n't know what i was doing wrong , ' she says			0
' i knew i was different , but i just thought it was my fault and that i was n't the popular type			0
' in her 20s @entity3 met her husband @entity208 , a firefighter , now 44 ( the couple have since separated )			1
' he carried me in social situations			0
i felt safe with him , ' says @entity3			1
' i still struggled with female friendships , though			2
' then , when their son @entity18 was three - and - a - half years old , he was diagnosed with @entity1 's			1
' luckily , i never had a problem bonding with the children , ' says @entity3			2
' but before @entity18 's diagnosis , i had wondered if his behaviour was my fault			2
i even went to parenting classes			0
' after their daughter @entity19 's diagnosis at the age of nine , @entity3 wondered if she herself had it , too , as @entity19 's behaviour was so similar to her own			1
' i started doing more research and took an online diagnosis test for @entity1 's and scored quite high , ' says @entity3			1
' it was a wake - up call			0
' my gp said there was no point getting a diagnosis , but i knew through my experience with my children that the right support can make a difference			0
i was eventually diagnosed in 2011 , but only after being referred to a psychiatrist for depression by my gp			2
' it was a great relief to finally find out why i 'd always felt like an outsider			0
' @entity242 , head of campaigns at the @entity80 , says the problem is that the condition is often not spotted			0
he adds : ' only 63 of 152 local authorities have a diagnostic pathway in place - a set route for @entity249 to refer on to a specialist so people with suspected @entity1 can be assessed			2
' once the condition is diagnosed , the charity runs courses on social skills , a befriending scheme as well as providing information on employment and other training			2
since @entity3 's diagnosis , she has completed a maths qualification , taken a cognitive behavioural therapy course to help with her anxiety and now works as a volunteer mentor in a school			1
' my confidence has improved and i can finally explain to people why i might come across the way i do , ' explains @entity3			2
' i 'd love to work in education - and i think with support i could study for qualifications			0
' all we " @entity1 " need is some extra help with our social skills			2
