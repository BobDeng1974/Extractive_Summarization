by @entity0 published : 03:09 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 09:22 est , 30 july 2013 its boot may be smaller than the average suitcase , but this baby - faced @entity4 took up every inch of its baggage allowance to take a trip aboard a @entity9 passenger airliner			2
the new £ 30,000 city runaround , named the @entity11 by the luxury motor brand , was flown by special command on an @entity15 aircraft from @entity16 to @entity17 in time for the birthday celebrations of a wealthy customer			1
most of us wince when we find out our baggage is a few kilograms over the airline 's allowance , but for this customer , the additional charge would have come to almost £ 10,000			2
however , they went through @entity27 because it was the cheapest and quickest way to get the car transported and was charged based on the airline 's cargo rates			2
tight squeeze : this was the first time a car had been squeezed into the hold of an @entity27 plane leaving @entity16 the vehicle weighs 988kg , according to the @entity4 website			1
so at £ 10 per every extra kilogram for checked in baggage over and above the 30kg limit , the client would have forked out £ 9,580 to put this large piece of luggage in the @entity15 hold			1
the lavishly appointed supermini – which bears the car company ’s famous winged badge – was carefully strapped onto an @entity27 plate and was the first car to have been transported in the hold of one of the airline ’s twice - daily 777 jets flying out of @entity16			1
like a scene almost from a @entity59 movie , the car , believed to be a gift , was carefully manoeuvred into place in the baggage hold of the passenger jet before setting off for @entity64 last week before travelling on to @entity17			0
it eventually arrived safely at its destination 48 hours after take - off			0
@entity68 , @entity69 cargo manager for @entity27 , said yesterday : ‘ the @entity11 certainly stood out from the other plates at our @entity72 warehouse , especially as it is the first time a car has flown on our @entity16 flight			1
’ the shipper of the @entity4 , @entity78 of motor retailer @entity79 , said his company had been concerned that completing the shipment on time would have proved too tall an order , until he contacted @entity27			0
the brand new £ 30,000 city runaround , named the @entity11 by the luxury motor brand , is taxied out to its flight the lavish cargo , complete with flight document details on its windscreen , was first strapped down onto a metal pallet it was then positioned next to the enormous @entity94 ready to be raised up into the hold mr @entity78 added : ‘ without them , this shipment could not have been delivered on time			1
‘ @entity15 promised to deliver it in a matter of days and were the only ones who could do so			0
flying it out of @entity16 also saved us the time and inconvenience of further land transport			0
‘ the @entity11 is a fantastic little car and @entity15 have transported her efficiently and with great care			2
’ regarded as one of the funkiest city cars in production , the @entity11 is identical to the £ 13,000 @entity114 , but has a deluxe interior and a premium £ 30,995 price tag			0
@entity4 has also remade every body panel except the roof			0
the @entity11 shares the distinctive bright aluminium grille of the £ 1million one - 77 model and the leather interior is all hand - stitched			2
and while the 777 which transported her was belching out @entity126 , the supermini was developed to cut the @entity4 car fleet ’s average co2 emissions below the 130g/km level where it would have incurred hefty @entity132 fines			0
the lavish miniature @entity4 just about fitted into the plane 's cargo compartment and was delivered to its customer in @entity17 within 48 hours despite the price tag and its ‘ jet - set ’ associations , the @entity11 is by far the smallest and slowest car in the @entity4 range			1
it shares the same 1.33 - litre engine , chassis and gearbox as its @entity114 parent , achieving a top speed of 107mph and 0 - 62mph in 11.6 seconds			0
however , it can boast far better fuel economy than the thirsty grown - up cousins favoured by @entity59 , returning 54.3mpg and relatively healthy co2 emissions of 116 g / km. the @entity151 was able to swiftly transport the special gift to its customer last leg : it took just 48 hours for the brand new vehicle to be transported from @entity16 to its final destination in @entity17 , via @entity64 , for a special gift			1

the miniature @entity11 model just squeezed into an @entity27 plane
the lavish car was flown from @entity16 to @entity17 for a special customer
the @entity11 was 958kg over the 30kg allowance on an @entity15 flight
at £ 10 per extra kg , the client would have paid £ 9,580 to check in the car
but the car was shipped as part of @entity27 *service* so would have had a flat - rate *fee*
