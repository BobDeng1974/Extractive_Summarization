@entity0 @entity1 - 5 captained pretty well in the first innings , appearing to have learned the lessons from @entity4			1
in the second innings , he was too reactionary			1
was unlucky to be bowled round his legs and dropping @entity9 reflected a scrambled mind			1
@entity11 - 7 an old - fashioned opener and judging by the way he batted after such a long stint in the field , he appears to be mentallytough			2
there is still a concern when the ball is full around off stump			2
@entity22 - 7 was very composed in the first innings — just what you need from your @entity26			2
still susceptible to the inswinger , but if he keeps going like this @entity0 will have found a decent replacement for @entity30			1
drop in form : @entity0 captain @entity1 looks on after drawing the first test against @entity33 @entity34 - 6 got to be careful he does not go back to the @entity34 of old — the maker of pretty but infuriating 20s and 30s			1
that is especially important now that @entity30 and @entity38 are no longer there and @entity1 is struggling			2
fielding getting better with age			2
@entity41 - 9.5 he was brilliant on a surface that did not suit his back - foot tendencies			1
the tempo of his 154 was helped by the aggression of @entity46 , but he shepherded the last few wickets superbly			2
after his 200 against @entity49 , it ’s all very encouraging			2
i also like his feistiness			2
stunning : @entity0 batsman @entity41 is congratulated by @entity52 after reaching his century at @entity54 saluting the fans : @entity41 leaves the field at @entity54 after scoring 154 not out in the first test @entity58 - 5 will be disappointed with his first - innings dismissal			1
he should have known that this was a surface where you stand up and ride the bounce , not turn your back on it			2
@entity68 improved , and took some vital wickets , including both @entity33 ’s openers in the second innings			2
@entity72 - 4 his keeping reflected where his body is at : he took a good one to his left on the first morning , then dropped three to his right as the game progressed			1
he needs a good series , because @entity80 is breathing down his neck			1
@entity82 - 5 looks low in confidence with the bat , but has knack of taking wickets			0
not sure @entity0 have worked him out			1
if he is a batting all - rounder , he can go in at @entity89 and @entity0 can play a frontline spinner			1
if he is a bowling all - rounder , he is vulnerable if they do draft in @entity93			0
one of @entity0 's better performers : @entity46 emerged with credit from the @entity96 @entity46 - 9 just a fantastic player , with a great cricket brain			1
if i was captaining against him , i would always be doubly switched on			0
@entity101 - 5 he showed with that second - innings dismissal of @entity9 that he does not just have to be a bang - it - in bowler			0
i did wonder why he kept trying bouncers and i just hope he gets a surface later on in this series where he can show he is not one - dimensional			0
@entity52 - 9 the world ’s gone mad : i ca n’t believe i ’m giving @entity52 nine out of 10 mainly for his batting			0
his 81 on saturday really lifted the country after what has happened these last eight months			0
and the way he kept running in was a reminder of his excellent levels of fitness			0
impressive innings : @entity52 scores some runs during his stand of 81 on saturday at @entity54 @entity33 @entity122 - 4 two soft dismissals — and he will always be vulnerable if he keeps staying leg side of the swinging ball			0
@entity127 - 9.5 did brilliantly to score more than 200 runs			1
yes , the pitch suited him , but if @entity33 can find another superstar batsman they are going to take some series bowling out			1
@entity134 batsman : @entity127 scored more than 200 runs for @entity33 , although the pitch did favour his style @entity138 puts @entity33 in control @entity140 - 6 both his dismissals were a bit lame but he looks organised and loves to just bat and bat			1
@entity146 score just around the corner			0
@entity148 - 4 he likes to feel bat on ball and that strong bottom hand can get him into trouble in this series			0
@entity154 - 5 unlucky dismissal in the first innings but enough to suggest he will get runs			0
looks organised and well - balanced			0
@entity9 - 8 captained well , apart from when he lost the plot during the last - wicket stand between @entity41 and @entity52			1
vulnerable when there is a bit of bounce			0
run out : @entity33 captain @entity9 was run out by a direct throw in the first test against @entity0 @entity167 - 6 struggles outside off with the ball going across him and played an ugly flash in the first innings to one that was too close to cut			1
@entity173 - 6 showed yesterday why he was in the side but had a bit of a shocker before			0
out for a duck and virtually ignored by his captain			0
@entity180 - 9 looks a really good player and could trouble @entity1 if the ball swings			0
quicker than he looks and a very handy , gutsy no 9			0
bowled over : @entity0 's @entity72 walks back to the pavilion after being bowled by @entity180 @entity187 - 8 possibly the most dangerous bowler on either side , especially bowling a fuller length , but still struggling with no - balls			1
@entity192 - 6 batted well in that last - wicket stand with @entity180 , but i was a bit disappointed with his bowling .			0

former @entity0 batsman gives his *verdict* on the *performances* in first test
he thinks @entity41 was @entity0 's standout performer , while @entity127 also impressed for the *visitors*
@entity207 says @entity72 needs to up his game with @entity80 waiting in the wings to replace him
