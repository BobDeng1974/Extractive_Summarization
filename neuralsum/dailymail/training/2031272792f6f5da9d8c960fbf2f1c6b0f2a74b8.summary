the communities secretary said it had taken @entity15 ten years to ‘ destroy ’ the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it			2
he revealed the @entity3 are now looking at setting down ‘ minimum standards ’ , making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections			1
councils should also be forced to publicise when long - running contracts with waste firms are up for renewal , giving voters a chance to demand a return to a weekly service , he said			2
admitting his frustration at the lack of progress so far , mr @entity2 told the @entity30 : ‘ if people get impatient with me , so be it			2
they are n’t as impatient as i am			0
’ the minister , who argues weekly rubbish collections are a ‘ fundamental right ’ , has been under increasing pressure over his repeated pledges before the election to reverse the trend towards a fortnightly service that began under @entity15			1
but the proportion of councils operating black bag collections every other week has increased from 57 per cent in 2010 to 69 per cent last year			0
most councils have shunned a £ 250million fund set up by mr @entity2 to pay for the reintroduction of weekly services			1
instead , the cash has been used to support the retention of weekly services in areas which still offer them			0
mr @entity2 ’ @entity53 only has authority over councils in @entity56 , where it says its efforts have slowed down the movement towards fortnightly bin collections			1
mr @entity2 insisted the @entity11 had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in @entity56			1
file picture in parts of @entity65 and @entity66 , where the department has no say , some councils are even considering collecting black bag rubbish only once every three weeks			0
mr @entity2 insisted the @entity11 had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in @entity56 , with four million more still getting them from councils outside the scheme			1
he said he had also abolished plans for new bin taxes and changed the law to scrap unfair fines for people who do not put rubbish out correctly			0
‘ if we had n’t done what we have , we would have virtually no weekly collections			2
we ’ve certainly saved six million , but it ’s a process , ’ the minister said			0
‘ it was always going to be very difficult to take on the bin barons , take on the industry and stand up for what ordinary punters want			0
’ mr @entity2 said he wanted to amend @entity15 ’s @entity86 to include the minimum standards			0
‘ it would make it more difficult to do fortnightly collections and set out the type of collection that had to be made weekly , ’ he added .			1

*conservatives* want to make it difficult to provide fortnightly collections
@entity2 says weekly collections are a ' fundamental right ' of *homeowners*
but he says it may take 10 years to get all councils back to weekly pick - ups
