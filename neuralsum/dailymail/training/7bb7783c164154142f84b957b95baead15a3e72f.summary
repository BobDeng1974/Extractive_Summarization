professor @entity8 , deputy chief executive of the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , said that people who use too many painkillers to treat tension headaches could actually be causing themselves further pain			1
she told the @entity14 : ‘ it is important for people to understand that different headaches require different treatments , so a correct diagnosis is vital			1
‘ people may not know that overusing some types of medication for treating tension - type headaches or migraines can actually make things worse , causing further pain			1
’ as a result , @entity9 is releasing new guidelines to help doctors treat people suffering from headaches			1
they hope that the guidelines will ensure patients receive the correct treatment			1
@entity35 , a neurologist who has worked with @entity9 to draw up guidelines for the treatment of headaches , told the @entity14 : ‘ the effective management of headaches depends on making a correct diagnosis and agreeing on an appropriate treatment plan			1
medication overuse headaches are a common problem			2
’ @entity46 - @entity45 , director of @entity47 , said that the new standard is ‘ essential ’ in ensuring there continues to be progress in recognising the impact headaches can have on an individual , as well as on society			2
it is believed that ten million people in the @entity56 experience frequent headaches and that they cause 25 million lost working days every year			2
an estimated 500,000 women and 100,000 men in the @entity56 suffer daily headaches caused by the overuse of painkillers			2
research suggests the frequent use of drugs such as codeine , paracetamol , ibuprofen and aspirin can often be the main reason people suffer from repeated headaches - and has shown that between a quarter and two - thirds of headache sufferers overuse painkillers			1
they are not overdosing on their medication ; they are simply taking the pills for long periods of time			0
but the more a painkiller is taken , the more resistant the body becomes to it			0
so the sufferer has then to resort to a stronger painkiller			0
when the medication wears off , they can get a withdrawal reaction - known as a ' rebound ' headache - prompting them to take more medication			0
professor @entity8 , deputy chief executive of the @entity9 , said that people who use too many painkillers to treat tension headaches could be causing themselves further pain by this point , it is the absence of the medication that is actually causing the headache			1
the reason rebound headaches happen is not entirely clear , although it 's thought that painkiller overuse affects the flow of pain messages to the nerves			0
the problem is more common among women			0
this is largely because women are five times more likely to be affected by migraines than men			0
dr @entity113 , director of clinical research at the @entity115 , explains : ‘ medication overuse will lead to you waking up with a headache because your pain threshold is at its lowest - the painkillers will have worn off during the night			2
‘ using painkillers no more than two to three times a week is fine			0
it 's when they 're taken more frequently that the problems start			0
’ ' the only solution for rebound headaches is to stop taking the medication causing them .			0

professor @entity8 said using too many painkillers causes more pain
she said correct diagnosis and treatment is vital to avoid the problem
@entity9 is releasing new guidelines to help doctors treat people suffering from headaches - they aim to ensure people receive the right treatment
