protecting moored ships from terrorists has proved a heavy load on the mind of naval commanders over the last decade			2
now scientists may have found the answer - a robotic jet ski that can see underwater and travel at speeds of up to 40mph			1
the @entity11 craft is 10ft - long and can either be remote - controlled from a distance of up to one kilometre away or travel on pre-programmed routes			1
navy ships are particularly vulnerable to small boats and swimmers and it is this @entity34 that scientists at @entity38 defence contractor @entity36 hope the @entity11 will protect			2
@entity39 , a spokesman for @entity40 , told @entity41 : ' in both domestic and foreign ports , there ’s great concern about swimmers approaching the boats underwater			0
' the @entity46 has been working on the problem for some time			0
' engineers constructed the @entity11 by sawing the top half off a jet ski and equipping it with a video camera , underwater sonar and a surface radar - and possibly weapons sometime soon			1
the @entity11 is designed to prevent a suicide attack similar to @entity25 's 2000 offensive on the @entity26 while it was docked in @entity27 , an assault that claimed 17 lives more problematic was redesigning the jet ski so that it can travel at a slow speed			1
mr @entity39 said : ' it ’s a jet ski , it goes fast			0
human swimmers only go two knots			0
' we solved the problem by adding bow thrusters , so you can turn off the main propulsion and track at low speeds			0
' the @entity11 is also powered by a hydro - jet and not a propeller , so in the unlikely event of a collision with an innocent swimmer , injuries should be kept to a minimum			1
perhaps the greatest innovation is the pre-programmed patrol routes the @entity11 can be sent on based on a gps navigation system			1
using a robotic jet ski to carry out the boring and dangerous duty of protecting the immediate waters around navy frigates saves both time , and possibly even lives			0
