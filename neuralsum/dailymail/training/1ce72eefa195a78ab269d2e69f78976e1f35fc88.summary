by @entity0 hospital staff missed three vital opportunities to save a toddler with chicken pox and he would be alive today if they had acted , a coroner said yesterday			1
@entity7 was seen by doctors three times in three days after his mother became convinced his condition was deteriorating rapidly			2
but on each occasion she was given painkillers to make her son more comfortable and sent home			0
grieving : @entity7 ' mother @entity16 holds her son in a hospital ward			1
she told an inquest that she ' wished doctors had listened to her ' on the morning after the final hospital visit , 12 - month - old @entity7 , who had developed a bacterial infection , was found dead in his bed			1
@entity25 coroner @entity24 said @entity7 would have almost certainly have survived the infection had staff ‘ heeded ’ the warning signs , carried out routine tests and treated him			1
she added : ‘ a number of nurses and doctors were involved in @entity7 ’s care over a short period of time but nobody looked at the entire picture			1
‘ ultimately this led to @entity7 ’s death			2
had appropriate treatment been given on each of those three occasions it is likely @entity7 would have survived			2
’ his symptoms and his clinical progress over the three days ‘ were not properly heeded and acted upon ’ , she concluded			0
the coroner recorded a narrative verdict which said @entity7 died from pneumonia , likely to have been caused by the chicken pox			1
@entity7 ’s parents , @entity16 and @entity51 , wept as she delivered the verdict and spoke of the ‘ soul destroying ’ moment they realised more could have been done to save their son			2
miss @entity16 had provided a ‘ clear and comprehensive ’ account of @entity7 ’ symptoms at the walk - in centre but significant information was not noted by the nurse and it was not passed on			1
‘ given the significant change in @entity7 ’ condition i consider this was the first sign of the bacterial infection and there was a missed opportunity for investigations and a possible diagnosis at that time , ’ she added			1
‘ in my view he was displaying sufficient symptoms to warrant further investigation			0
’ his symptoms and his clinical progress over the three days ‘ were not properly heeded and acted upon ’ , she concluded			0
tragic : one - year - old @entity7 plays in a baby walker			2
he died after contracting chicken pox and doctors missed a bacterial infection three times delivering a narrative verdict the coroner said @entity7 died from pneumonia which was likely to have been caused by the chicken pox			1
miss @entity16 and @entity7 ’s father , @entity51 , 32 , wept as she delivered the verdict and spoke of the ‘ soul - destroying ’ moment they realised more could have been done to save their son			2
‘ i still ca n’t believe that @entity7 is no longer with us , ’ said miss @entity16			2
‘ he was such a content baby , a real happy chappie			0
‘ his big sister keeps telling me she misses her little brother			0
it has hit both myself and @entity51 very hard			0
‘ hearing that treatment given to @entity7 could have been different and could have saved his life was completely soul destroying			1
‘ i just hope that changes can be made and more notice taken of parents ’ concerns to try and prevent them from having to go through the same heartache			0
‘ i knew something was wrong but the doctors kept reassuring me			0
’ miss @entity16 is now calling for a national immunisation programme for chicken pox			1
vaccination is routinely available in the @entity109 and @entity110 , but it is not offered to children in the @entity112			0
miss @entity16 , from @entity113 , said her son had enjoyed normal health until falling ill with chickenpox after his four - year - old sister , @entity117 , caught it			0
he came out in blisters on his face , was running a temperature , had breathing problems and shaking episodes			0
his face swelled like he had been in the ring with boxer @entity124 , she told the inquest			0
she rushed her son to @entity25 ’s @entity127 walk - in centre on wednesday , march 30 last year and was told he had infected chickenpox			0
but a questionnaire filled in by a nurse , which detailed @entity7 ’s pain , rash , high temperature , shaking episodes and breathing problems , was not passed to the gp who later saw him			1
as a result the @entity137 thought he was treating him for chickenpox and nothing more			0
@entity7 returned to hospital the following day and then the third , but on each occasion the chance to intervene with appropriate treatment was missed and he died on april 2			1
following @entity7 ’ death , @entity147 now gives antibiotics to all children they see with chickenpox			2
they are also physically examined by a registrar and if needed by a senior doctor within four hours of admission .			1

coroner says @entity7 was failed by hospital : ' nobody looked at the entire picture '
toddler was given *anti-virals* for chicken pox but *simple* antibiotics would have saved his life , says *expert*
form warning about symptoms was not passed to doctor , who missed the *secondary* bacterial infection
senior doctor said tot was a ' very happy *smiling* child ' as killer infection became worse
discharged a third time with painkillers and found *lifeless* the next day
