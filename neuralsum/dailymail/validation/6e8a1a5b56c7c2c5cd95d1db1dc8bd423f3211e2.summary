the @entity1 family had never been on holiday to @entity3 before , nor had we previously experienced an all inclusive package			1
so as my wife @entity9 , nine - year - old daughter @entity7 and i arrived at the @entity12 resort on the @entity14 coast , the place was facing a tough test			1
the reception area was plush and polished , with acres of wood , glass and marble			2
@entity22 with his wife @entity9 and nine - year - old daughter @entity7 at the @entity12 resort in @entity3 to @entity7 's delight , plenty of kids were lounging around on giant sofas availing themselves of free wi - fi and watching giant tvs			1
as the adults sipped cocktails at the lobby bar , the hotel appeared bustling but by no means overcrowded - probably because @entity12 is a huge , rambling resort with seemingly endless facilities			1
all 551 rooms were taken when we stayed , housing around 1,100 adults and 500 children			2
but there was never any sense we were competing for space			2
this may well be because the site is set in 100 acres , has seven pools , water slides , beaches , an amphitheatre , five bars and seven restaurants			1
@entity7 quickly made friends with other @entity56 children and more or less disappeared for the fortnight			2
this is a resort completely geared towards family satisfaction and we were totally happy for the children to play in the pools , visit the various restaurants and go to the arcade unsupervised			1
that said , i suspect the amount of vegetables consumed at their private lunches was in inverse proportion to the volume of ice - cream eaten			0
if that was the case they were missing out , as the food was tremendous - endless buffets of fresh fish , salads , grilled meats - and 20 desserts			0
for a small supplement , guests can also choose from à la carte restaurants			1
@entity12 is in the @entity84 region , which is dominated by the towering presence of @entity86 , the highest peak in southern @entity3			1
it demands a visit so we took the cable car to the 7,757ft summit			0
at € 210 ( around £ 150 ) for the three of us , it was n't cheap but it was worth it to experience the glorious panorama			0
the pool complex at @entity12 was a hit with the @entity102 family in true @entity104 , this was our only excursion from the resort as we were more than happy to luxuriate on the beach or by the pool			1
the only other added extra we chose to invest in was one of the £ 100 - a - day pavilions on the pristine beach			0
these private retreats came equipped with robes , sofas , sunbeds and a fridge			0
and if you could n't be bothered to open the fridge door yourself , a waiter would bring over drinks and snacks			0
we could have taken part in all sorts of activities , from aqua - aerobics to archery , dancing and poolside it 's a knockout - style games			2
the beach party was a riot of noise , while the nightly entertainment included amazing @entity134 acrobats			0
the @entity136 production of @entity137 had @entity9 and i doing the full @entity139 and @entity141 routine ... much to @entity7 's utter horror			2
for a more peaceful break you can simply retreat to the calm of the rolling gardens			0
@entity12 really did offer a fabulous holiday experience for the whole family			1
@entity7 was happy - and if children are happy , contentment for all will surely follow			0
getting there @entity152 ( thomson.co.uk , 0871 230 2555 ) offers seven - night holidays at the @entity154 on a half - board basis from £ 499pp , including return flights from @entity157 and transfers .			0
