by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 16:43 est , 14 december 2013 @entity3 : 16:45 est , 14 december 2013 the latest documents from the @entity5 leaked by @entity6 show that government spies are capable of listening in on mobile phone calls that use a common form of encryption			1
the @entity11 on published confidential government documents provided by @entity6 that show that the @entity5 can ' process ' cellular phone calls on gsm networks , even if they are encrypted			1
observers have long known that military and law enforcement officials are capable of hacking into a suspect ’s mobile phone			2
@entity21 , which stands for @entity21 , is the world 's most widely used cellphone technology — though several large networks , notably @entity25 and @entity26 , rely on an older network technology called @entity28			0
the cellphone encryption technology used most widely across the world can be easily defeated by the @entity5 giving the agency the means to decode most of the billions of calls and texts that travel over public airwaves every day watching and listening : the agency ’s ability to crack encryption used by the majority of cellphones in the world offers it wide - ranging powers to listen in on private conversations			1
they 're listening : @entity47 law prohibits the @entity5 from collecting the content of conversations between @entity47 without a court order			2
if the @entity5 has the capacity to easily decode encrypted cellphone conversations , then other nations likely can do the same calls that have been encrypted according to a common standard called @entity56 / 1 — which was developed in 1987			1
the vulnerability comes into play on @entity60 networks , which modern cellphones may resort to it when @entity64 networks are not available or too congested			0
more modern networks like @entity64 and @entity66 , found throughout the @entity47 and other wealthy nations , are more difficult to decode			0
the @entity11 found that more than 80 percent of cell phones used in the world use outdated and vulnerable technology			0
@entity71 , a computer scientist at the @entity72 , said that type of encryption ' was designed 30 years ago , and you would n’t expect a 30 - year - old car to have the latest safety mechanisms			2
' experts suggest that while it takes longer for analysts to decode and examine messages sent on higher systems , it is indeed possible			0
some carriers are already making the change to the newer @entity56 / 3 method of encryption , however , it does n't matter how strong strong their encryption , the calls are automatically decoded upon reaching the carrier 's internal network			0
the @entity5 has repeatedly stated that it only snoops on conversations involving foreign citizens , as it has no legal basis by which to conduct such surveillance on @entity47			1
hq : the @entity5 has been secretly collecting the phone call records of millions of @entity47 , using data provided by telecom firms @entity102 and @entity25 for years statement : @entity6 had previously insisted that every phone call and internet transaction made in @entity47 is logged current @entity47 law makes it illegal for the @entity5 to monitor phone conversations between @entity47 citizens without a court order , yet these documents reveal that the agency is capable of overriding encryption and listening in on international citizens			1
the @entity11 warned that the intelligence agencies of other nations likely have the same technology , and may even listen in on @entity47 phone calls			1
this method of surveillance has made headlines recently because of the reported @entity5 tap on world leaders , including @entity125 chancellor @entity124			2
' the scale of foreign surveillance has become so vast , the amount of information about @entity47 ' incidentally ' captured may itself be approaching mass surveillance levels , '' said @entity132 of the @entity135 's @entity134 and @entity133			0
' the government should be targeting its surveillance at those suspected of wrongdoing , not assembling massive associational databases that by their very nature record the movements of a huge number of innocent people , ' said @entity145 , a staff attorney for the @entity146 .			0

*snowden* documents and officials reveal agency is able to listen into phone calls even if they are encrypted
@entity5 has repeatedly stated that it only snoops on conversations involving foreign citizens
the code has been cracked for years
@entity5 says its collection is lawful
