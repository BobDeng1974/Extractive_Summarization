but after seeing off @entity17 , courtesy of @entity20 's goal just after the hour in rainy conditions at the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity1 says they will now be looking to win against the competition favourites			1
winners : @entity20 celebrates @entity2 's only goal and now their manager says they want to beat @entity7 the 1 - 0 win was the very least the @entity9 deserved for an enterprising display in which @entity32 controversially had two first - half goals ruled out for offside			1
@entity2 face their biggest challenge next as they travel to @entity38 to face the hosts in their second group a game next tuesday			2
after the win @entity1 said : ' the team did great work			2

we will go out to win the next game , we are more excited than ever			0
' we will concentrate on what we have to do			0

bring on @entity7 : the @entity9 have had their confidence boosted after starting their campaign with three points he said : ' they disallowed two goals that were valid , but we knew it could be like that			1
' the important thing is that we picked ourselves up , we looked for the result and we got it			0
' @entity17 , who have won just one match at the @entity11 finals since 1990 , were underwhelming after a week of turmoil following a row between players and the national federation over bonuses			0
outspoken : @entity1 has a word with referee @entity87 after growing frustrated with his decisions close : @entity90 striker @entity89 came off the bench and was unlucky not to double the lead coach @entity93 , however , remained optimistic			2
