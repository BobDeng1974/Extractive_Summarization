by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 29 august 2013 the @entity2 mall is dying as an increasing number of super-sized shopping centers are closed or torn down and replaced with office buildings			2
the malls built during the 60s , 70s and 80s are most at risk , and analysis firm @entity10 forecasts that 10per cent of them will close within the next 10 years			1
but ceos say the rate may actually be much higher , @entity13 reports - and the final nail in the coffin could be the rise of smaller , open air ' anti malls '			1
@entity22 snapshot : at @entity24 , the @entity23 is empty the massive enclosed malls epitomized by 1980s teen movies @entity27 and @entity28 were built by the @entity29 as part of @entity32 suburbia			1
many of their children came of age inside the shopping centers , and had their first dates over a piece of @entity40 followed by movie or video game			2
but since the early 00s , as young workers leave the suburbs for urban centers , old - school malls have been in decline			1
the giant structures seem out of place in the pedestrianized areas , because the blank walls and limited doors make them awkward to access			2
the @entity54 has also hit malls hard			1
online retail saw a 14per cent increase this year , according to @entity58 , and is growing around 10 times faster than brick - and - mortar stores			1
abandoned stores : @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 is crumbling deserted hallways : at @entity66 , customers can not throw lucky pennies into the fountain , because it has no water there are many blogs and sites devoted to mall death watches			0
@entity75 memorializes more than 400 shuttered shopping destinations , and more are always being added			0
even the iconic @entity77 that was the setting for @entity27 and @entity28 closed down in the mid- 1990s			0
like many other shopping centers , it sat vacant for several years before being re-opened as a much smaller open - air plaza			1
indeed , shoppers are also flocking to hybrid destinations like @entity84 , with outdoor streets and a farmer 's marked next door that give it a small - town feel			0
each year the complex attracts more than 18 million shoppers , and huge crowds turn out for its special events			0
that was then : during the 1980s the malls were a popular teen hangout , as shown in the movie @entity98 at @entity27 this is now : shoppers come in droves to @entity84 in @entity102 , a pedestrianized open - air collection of shops and restaurants with a farmer 's market next door experts also say that @entity111 customers want a smaller , more personalized shopping experience - and stores are scrambling to provide it			1
@entity116 magazine mentions @entity117 , which has been transformed from decaying industrial strip to chic shopping destination , as a suburban center that has gotten a successful makeover			0
some experts argue that mall death stories are premature , because the provide @entity2 with communal space			0
shopping centers have been around at least since @entity126 brought a six - story complex of shops and offices to @entity130 in 107 ad			0
bazaars and souks flourished in @entity133 and @entity135 countries for thousands of years , and covered arcades were all the rage in 18th and 19th century @entity138			2
the environment may change , but @entity2 will always love to shop .			0

at least 10per cent of large malls will close within the next 10 years , according to @entity10
