@entity1 's daughter : @entity2 believed she had ' lost in ego ' syndrome and would die a ' lonely death ' a college lecturer jumped 50ft to her death from the top of a building just hours after hospital staff put her severe suicidal depression down to ‘ sleep deprivation ’ , an inquest has heard			1
@entity2 , of @entity14 , @entity15 - who believed she had ‘ lost in ego ’ syndrome and would die a ‘ lonely death ’ - had urged her mother to take her to the euthanasia clinic @entity22 after a long - term romance had ended			1
despite being referred three times for urgent treatment due to concerns about her mental health , the vicar ’s daughter was sent home by a psychiatric nurse at @entity31			1

miss @entity2 was taken to hospital by ambulance but later died from multiple internal injuries			1
it later emerged that waiting lists in @entity15 for long - term psychotherapy treatment spanned from at least 12 weeks to nine months , which led to miss @entity2 becoming more anxious due to the lack of support she deemed necessary			1

her father , reverend @entity65 , 85 , said : ‘ our daughter ’s untimely death is obviously related to the adequacy of mental health services			2
‘ in our opinion mental health services are underfunded in relation to other forms of illness and they ’re obviously very complicated due to the number of referrals that need to be made for treatment			2
‘ it ’s much more difficult to assess the need to hospitalise someone who is mentally ill than someone who has had physical injury			2
it ’s very difficult for any person to make that decision			2
for us @entity2 ’s deterioration happened so quickly			1
the last six months were very rapid			2

’ following the tragedy a report by dr @entity237 of the @entity238 said there were concerns about access to therapy and long waiting lists			1
‘ long waiting lists are unsatisfactory but they are generally the same across the country , ’ she said			2
