a celebrated set of church bells have been silenced after market traders operating in the area complained that the three hours of deafening chiming lost them valuable business			1
the ten bells at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , were chiming in a rare full peal as a gesture of goodwill to the local community			1
but the relentless noise was not appreciated by workers at @entity16 - which has been a permanent fixture in the church 's vicinity every friday and saturday since the 16th century			2
@entity7 in @entity8 , @entity20 , has received a letter of complaint after its bells chimed for three hours on saturday @entity24 , of the @entity27 fruit and vegetable stall which backs on to the church 's gates , said : ' it went on for more than three hours			2
' apart from us not being able to think , there was a definite line in the market where people were not going			0
' they just would n't go in to that space because of the noise			0
' mr @entity24 complained to the church after saturday 's three - hour bombardment but claims he is yet to receive a response			0
local traders at @entity16 , which lies in the grand church 's shadow , ( the steeple can be seen in top left of picture ) said their customers were being driven away by the deafening sound of continuous ringing the @entity16 in @entity8 , @entity9 , features rows of outdoor stalls lined along @entity16 - the road which leads up to the church he added : ' i am not against bell ringing or the church but this did go on for quite a long time and it affected trade			1
' i hope some compromise can be found			0
' the next big peal was scheduled for november with a visiting bell - ringing team set to do the honours			1
a peal is the name given to a specific type of performance of change ringing , the art of ringing a set of tuned bells in a series of mathematical patterns			0
for a performance to be recognised as a peal it must consist of at least 5040 changes on up to seven working bells			0
the event has now been cancelled to the dismay of @entity7 's regular church - goers			1
@entity85 , who runs the indoor market in @entity87 , said he was not affected			2
he said : ' we could not really hear it inside			0
i heard that some market stall holders outside had written to the church because it got on their nerves a bit			2
' team rector , reverend @entity98 and church wardens @entity95 and @entity99 issued a statement in response			0
' @entity87 has 10 bells - there are not many local churches with that number and of course the bells become popular for visiting bell ringers , ' the statement read			1
' on the morning of september 27 a visiting bellringer team managed to ring a full peal - quite an achievement in itself - which lasted for three hours and five minutes			1
' this is the first time a full peel has been rung on a saturday morning for quite a while			0
' we understand that certain outside market stall holders found it difficult to hear for the length of time the peal was rung			2
' it is a fact that church bells are of a certain volume so that they can be heard ! ' as a goodwill gesture we have cancelled a peal that was to be rung by another visiting bellringer team on a saturday morning in november			1
' any future peals for commemorations of events or ringing before or after religious services will take place as normal			0
' the market has been running on fridays and saturdays in the small @entity9 town since the 16th century the next full peal of bells were scheduled for november but have now been cancelled out of consideration of the market traders			1

ten bells were rung in full peal at @entity87 , @entity9
rare event featuring guest bell - ringers was meant as a gesture of goodwill
but market traders say the deafening chiming lost them valuable business
they have written to the church - and the next full peal is now cancelled
