the 21 - year - old man who underwent the world 's first successful penis transplant has been able to resume a sexual relationship with this girlfriend just five weeks after the transplant			1
professor @entity6 , who took part in the nine - hour surgery on the @entity10 man , said : ' he gets good quality erections , ejaculates and has frequent sex with his partner			1
' he said doctors are now also appealing for donors to enable more men to have the operation			1
just five weeks after the transplant was carried out by surgeons from @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity10 , the 21 - year - old patient was able to have sex with his partner the operation was carried out by surgeons from @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity10 , using a donated penis			1
the man , who has not been named , lost all but a 1cm stump of his penis three years ago following a botched circumcision			2
he received the donated organ harvested from a man who was declared brain dead			1
professor @entity6 said the recipient had accepted the new organ as ' his own ' – and added the skin tone of the donor penis is similar to that of the patient			1
as part of the procedure , doctors transplanted a new penis , donated by a deceased man			1
the pictures , left and right , show the veins and blood vessels they connected ' it will never be 100 per cent similar , because even when the individuals have the same skin colour , complexions differ , ' the doctor added			1
ten years ago , a man in @entity56 received a transplant , but asked surgeons to remove the donated penis two weeks after the operation			1
professor @entity61 , who led the operation on december 11 last year , had spent years experimenting on cadavers to see which nerves , blood vessels and other elements had to be joined to guarantee full functioning			1
the procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical @entity10 hospital			1
the planning and preparation for the study started back in 2010			0
after extensive research professor van @entity61 and his surgical team decided to use techniques developed for the first facial transplant			0
' there are a number of men who would benefit from this operation but the issue is a lack of donors and also a lack of funding , ' he told @entity91 last week			2
a follow - up operation enabled the young man to urinate normally , without the aid of a catheter , and the doctors said his overall confidence had risen considerably since the procedure			2
the man has made a full recovery - a result which the doctors did not expect to occur until about december 2016			2
after the nine hour operation , the man recovered rapidly			1
the procedure has allowed him to become sexually active again			0
the picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man 's genital region professor van @entity61 said they were surprised by the patient 's rapid recovery			1
he said : ' our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery			1
' the recipient had sought medical help after being left with a non-functioning stump following a bungled procedure by an inept traditional ' surgeon '			0
as many as 250 men are estimated to lose their penises each year in a secret and brutal initiation ceremony conducted by the @entity126 tribe in @entity10			2
during the month of june , which marks the start of a new harvest , thousands of boys are sent naked into remote areas to survive with little more than a blanket and meagre rations			0
the ritual is known as ukwaluka and has been practiced for generations			0
the ultimate test of the rite of passage is the process of ukwaluka - the cutting of the penis foreskin that is done by an incibi - a traditional surgeon - which symbolises the beginning of manhood			0
however , infections and other complications are coming causing the death of scores of teenagers			0
each year , there are repeated calls for the ritual to be stopped			0
prof @entity153 said the success of the procedure meant it could eventually also be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer or as a last - resort treatment for severe erectile dysfunction due to the side effects from medication			0

this was the first successful operation of its kind , as a previous attempt did not lead to long - term recovery while full statistics are not available on the number of non medical circumcisions carried out in @entity179 and @entity180 , reports from the @entity175 show it is as low as 2 per cent in parts of @entity10 and up to 35 % per cent in @entity185 , @entity184 reports			1
professor @entity186 said : ' the heroes in all of this for me are the donor , and his family			2
they saved the lives of many people because they donated the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver , skin , corneas , and then the penis			2
' professor @entity6 said : ' it 's a massive breakthrough			0
we 've proved that it can be done – we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had			0
' ' it was a privilege to be part of this first successful penis transplant in the world			0
' nine more patients will now receive penile transplants			0
the @entity216 praised the surgeons who performed the operation			2
dr @entity219 , head of @entity220 , said : ' we are very proud to be part of this ground - breaking scientific achievement			0
' it is good to know that a young man 's life has been significantly changed with this very complex surgical feat. ' from experience we know that penile dysfunction and disfigurement has a major adverse psychological effect on people			0
