at the height of her fame she would n’t get out of bed for less than $ 10,000 a day			0
but now @entity4 is facing rather more prosaic money issues after getting embroiled in a row over who 's going to pay a $ 1.5 million ( £ 980,000 ) bill to repair the roof of her luxury @entity11 penthouse			2
the @entity15 model and other occupiers of the top - floor units at the @entity18 in @entity19 are suing the owners of the apartment block over the demand they pay the full cost of the work			1
@entity4 is in a dispute with the owners of the building in which she has her @entity11 penthouse over a $ 1.5 million bill to replace its roof the @entity18 , where penthouse residents including @entity33 want the cost of replacing the roof to be shared by all residents			1
it is in an area of @entity19 where some apartments go for as much as £ 5 million in a lawsuit filed on monday , @entity33 and other fellow top floor residents charge that the owners of the building at 525 w. 22nd @entity44 intend to violate the condominium ’s bylaws by landing them with the entire seven - figure cost			1
they argue the expense is supposed to be covered by the owners of all 30 units in the luxury loft complex in a wealthy neighbourhood where apartments cost as much as £ 5 million			0
the lawsuit says the owners got a legal opinion in 2011 that only those with private rooftop terraces on the sixth floor had to contribute anything towards the ongoing cost of maintaining the roof , but that residents of the entire building would be expected to put money towards a full replacement instead of carrying out the replacement then , the board started charging unit owners extra monthly fees to build up a fund to pay for it at later date , the lawsuit alleges			1
@entity15 @entity33 , 49 , was one of the original supermodels who ruled the catwalk in the 1990s but the board reportedly decided last month to go back to the original plan and replace the roof but with penthouse residents only now expected to pay the entire cost , including financing			1
a formal vote on the proposals by the board is scheduled for thursday night , but @entity33 and other plaintiffs are seeking to postpone it			0
they want more information about the extent of the work needed so the penthouse owners can properly resolve the issue of who should pay for it			0
the group argue it is unacceptable how one of the penthouse owners was told he would have to cough up $ 177,000 ( £ 116,000 ) , minus $ 12,000 he had already paid into the roof maintenance fund			2
@entity33 , 49 , who was born in @entity15 , was one of the group of supermodels who became famous in the 1990s for ruling the catwalk			2
she supposedly coined the phrase : ‘ we do n’t get out of bed for less than $ 10,000 a day ’ which came to symbolise the high money , high fashion world they lived in			0
