@entity0 humiliated @entity1 yesterday by defying his second request for an apology for making unwanted advances to female party activists			1
as the women who complained about the @entity9 peer ’s behaviour claimed they had been ‘ branded liars ’ , party leader mr @entity1 again tried and failed to wring a statement of regret from him			1
the complainants are now considering taking legal action for having their ‘ reputations trashed ’ after the party let its former chief executive escape punishment			0
unrepentant : @entity9 peer @entity0 has humiliated @entity1 they accused @entity0 of sexually inappropriate touching when he was the @entity9 ’ chief executive and also involved in candidate selection			1
on wednesday , a review of the case found their claims were ‘ credible ’ and that he should apologise for ‘ violating their space ’			0
but the @entity30 appointed to investigate , @entity31 , said the claims did not pass the tough , burden of proof threshold set in criminal cases			0
as a result there were no grounds on which to expel him from the party but both mr @entity31 and mr @entity1 said @entity0 should say sorry			1
the peer refused to do so and retains his position on a key party policy board			0
he is also likely to have the @entity9 whip reinstated at a @entity45 meeting on monday			0
yesterday mr @entity1 tried again when he told @entity46 that @entity0 should now ‘ do the decent thing ’			1
‘ he should apologise , ’ said mr @entity1			1
‘ i think it is a matter of very real regret – to put it mildly – that , so far at least , he has n’t chosen to apologise			0
’ @entity1 last night risked civil war in his party as he insisted @entity0 should not rejoin the @entity9 group in the @entity45 unless he apologises over sexual harassment allegations but the women involved are so furious at the leaderships ’ impotence they have rebuffed mr @entity1 ’s attempts to speak to them			1
one @entity9 activist said last night : ‘ it is infuriating to think that we are effectively being branded liars			0
’ and one complainant said she wanted to think ‘ very seriously ’ once the ‘ heat ’ had died down whether she and others should take legal action			0
their anger intensified after @entity69 , a senior @entity30 , said his friend @entity0 had ‘ nothing to apologise for ’			2
‘ astonishingly the @entity9 , our party , which has committed against secret justice has refused to allow either @entity0 or i as his legal representative ever to see @entity31 ’s report			1
what kind of justice system is that ? ’ he told @entity72 ’s today			0
mr @entity1 was also pressed on his @entity46 radio show on whether he had failed to deal with the complaints about @entity0			1
current and former @entity9 activists took to @entity86 to condemn the ruling that @entity0 will face no further action he admitted that ‘ the buck stops with me ’ and added : ‘ the party as a whole , and myself as leader , we ’ve got to take responsibility , [ we ] failed to respond to the concerns first raised			1
’ @entity95 , a @entity9 campaigner , waived her anonymity last night to claim she too had been a victim of @entity0			2
revealing that mr @entity1 had phoned her to apologise , she told @entity97 : ‘ he needs to be firm			2
' we should not be calling for women to resign , we should be calling for @entity0 ’s resignation			2
[ and ] he has not been found not guilty , either			0
' someone needs to man up here and do something about this			0
’ another alleged victim , @entity106 , said : ‘ the investigation has no credibility with either side and the party needs to start again from scratch , this time with transparency			0
’ @entity113 of @entity114 also angered victims by appearing to blame their ‘ reluctance ’ to come forward years ago for the lack of action			0
he added in an article for the @entity121 website : ‘ justice works both ways , however difficult that may be to take			0
’ @entity0 did not respond to calls from the @entity126			2
by @entity127 @entity1 sought to limit the damage over accusations of a cover - up yesterday by insisting that @entity0 will not be given any meaningful public role in the party			1
it was a hollow claim			0
not only will @entity0 be back in his usual place on the party ’s benches in the @entity45 as early as monday , he will also be at the next meeting of the party ’s influential @entity139 later this month			1
far from being exiled to its outer reaches , the party ’s former chief executive will be a key figure helping the policy committee to devise the @entity9 ’ 2015 election manifesto			1
@entity0 said he now plans to return to his roles in the party after the conclusion of the last report into his behaviour ‘ @entity156 ( @entity0 ) is a member of that committee , whatever the leadership may want , ’ said one of the disgraced peer ’s friends last night , ‘ and he will give it the benefit of all his experience			1
’ to the dismay of mr @entity1 and his supporters , who hoped he might quietly drift behind the scenes , @entity0 is also planning to stand for re-election to the policy committee in october ( elections happen every two years )			1
buoyed by the 100 letters of support submitted to the internal inquiry by senior party members , @entity0 is confident he will be re-elected			1
and if , as expected , he wins the support of the majority of the party ’s 43,000 activists , his victory will be announced during the @entity9 autumn conference in @entity179 , guaranteeing even more damaging headlines			2
a @entity9 spokesman said last night : ‘ it ’s true we ca n’t stop @entity0 attending the @entity139 meetings , nor can we stop him running for re-election to the committee if he wants to			2
’ it is a statement that underlines the deep divisions in the party over the @entity0 affair and the sense of anger and frustration in the @entity1 camp at the outcome of the investigation by the leading @entity196			1
the impotence of the party leadership is underlined by the fact that mr @entity1 ’s call for a public apology from @entity0 has been summarily rejected			1
‘ they wanted to hang @entity156 out to dry and failed , ’ said another senior @entity9 ‘ this is the worst of all worlds for us , as @entity156 is wounded but not fatally			0
’ @entity0 ’s friends have mocked the inquiry for its secrecy and ineffectiveness			2
@entity9 president @entity211 said @entity0 should apologise under @entity9 rules , mr @entity31 was not allowed to speak to any of the ten women who made the sexual harassment allegations against @entity0 , and they were allowed only to submit written statements			1
and this is a party that prides itself on equality and transparency ! @entity0 ’s critics say there are two main reasons he has escaped without sanction			1
first , the @entity9 party is inherently chauvinistic			0
an investigation last year by @entity227 fund manager @entity226 after the @entity0 affair first broke , found the party failed to live up to its ideals of equality and liberty , and that there was a culture of ‘ low - level sexism ’ with reports of widespread ‘ sexism and misogyny ’			1
second , no individual has ever wielded more power and influence or instilled more fear within the @entity9 than the overweight , balding and bespectacled @entity0			2
he is nicknamed @entity242 , after the mystic who mesmerised the @entity246 @entity245 under the last @entity247 , and he still has immense influence			0
a former party agent , he rose to become director of campaigns and elections between 1989 and 2002 and chief executive until 2009			0
when @entity1 became party leader , he made clear he wanted get rid of @entity0 – who had masterminded general election campaigns for @entity257 and @entity258 – and put his own man in the job			1
‘ @entity156 was regarded as too close to @entity262 and @entity258 and therefore too left wing and too liberal			0
having served two leaders , he was also seen by @entity1 ’s people as too powerful , too set in his ways , ’ explained a source			2
when @entity0 eventually quit as chief executive in 2009 the official explanation was ‘ health reasons ’			2
the truth was he went because the @entity9 leadership realised the growing number of sex - pest allegations against their married chief executive meant his position was unsustainable			0
mr @entity1 , who was glad to see the back of @entity0 , was confident the allegations would never see the light of day , which explains why no action was taken			1
it was a bad miscalculation and , given the fury of @entity0 ’s alleged victims over the ‘ whitewash ’ , the row can now only escalate			2
to try to draw a line under the controversy , the party leadership has told mps not to go on the airwaves			0
but not everyone is listening			0
@entity211 , the ambitious party president , has been quick to speak out , for example			0
‘ while this process has not found to a criminal standard of proof that @entity0 acted with indecent intent , ’ he said , ‘ it is clear that he did not behave in the way that a chief executive should behave			1
@entity0 must reflect on his actions and apologise to the women involved			0
’ mr @entity211 , who is no fan of @entity1 , hopes to be the next @entity9 leader			0
and the more mud that sticks to @entity1 over the @entity0 affair , the more likely that is to happen .			1

report by @entity196 says lord @entity309 ' *invaded* *personal* space '
but allegations could not prove he brought the party into *disrepute*
@entity1 made clear @entity0 will play no part in the 2015 election
but female activists and candidates say they are ' *ashamed* ' at the ruling
