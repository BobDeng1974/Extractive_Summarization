by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 24 may 2013 we have all heard of the @entity2			0
but in certain circles , it is the @entity5 touch that is really gaining traction in common parlance			0
for every item worn by sisters @entity10 and @entity11 become major hits for the stores or labels concerned - and the peach dress worn by @entity5 to the @entity17 summer party earlier this week is no exception			2
the £ 285 dress is the work of @entity22 designer @entity21 and was being sold exclusively via luxury retail site my - wardrobe.com - until the @entity5 sister stepped out wearing it on wednesday and a flurry of @entity11 fans rushed to bag their own version			1
flower power : @entity11 wore the peach @entity21 dress at the @entity17 party earlier this week the cap - sleeved @entity35 dress is billed on the site as being designed ' to fit perfectly for summer events , summer weddings or parties ' - so it looks like @entity11 applied the dress to the appropriate occasion too			1
well done her ! @entity21 , the @entity22 talent behind the dress , has already seen great success with her eponymous label , which she has been focusing on full - time after folding @entity49 , the label she ran along with @entity52			0
it is not a bad item for @entity11 to spark a run on either , given that it was created with goodwill in mind			0
for each dress sold , 30 per cent of the proceeds go to charity , meaning that for each one , £ 85.50 will be donated to @entity62 , one of the major campaigns run by @entity65			1
the site will be accepting pre-orders for the second drop now , so if you 're keen to polish up like @entity11 while helping a good cause , visit my - wardrobe.com now			1
sellout ! no joy here - the dress has sold out in every size - but pre-orders for a second drop are being taken			2

@entity11 wore the @entity79 dress on wednesday evening
dress sold out on my - wardrobe.com soon after @entity11 was seen
pre-orders of a second drop are being taken now
£ 85.50 from the sale of each dress to benefit @entity62
