' email started simply as a way to send digital notes around the office , ' said @entity1 's @entity20			2
' but fast - forward 30 years and with just the phone in your pocket , you can use email to contact virtually anyone in the world … from your best friend to the owner of that bagel shop you discovered last week			1
' the new inbox will address the rpboem of getting too much email			2
' with this evolution comes new challenges : we get more email now than ever , important information is buried inside messages , and our most important tasks can slip through the cracks — especially when we ’re working on our phones			1
' for many of us , dealing with email has become a daily chore that distracts from what we really need to do — rather than helping us get those things done			2
' for now the new service is being provided alongside @entity48 , which was launched in 2004			0

' @entity30 is by the same people who brought you @entity48 , but it 's not @entity48 : it 's a completely different type of inbox , designed to focus on what really matters , ' the company said in a blog post			1
@entity1 said @entity30 displays real - time updates to emails - for example , showing the delivery status of items bought online			1
@entity30 highlights the key information from important messages , such as flight itineraries , event information , and photos and documents emailed to you by friends and family			1
it will even display useful information from the web that was n’t in the original email , such as the real - time status of your flights and package deliveries			1
it lets you add your own reminders , from picking up the dry cleaning to giving your parents a call and can show the relevant numbers alongside tasks			0
it also shows reminders in a more accessible way that allows users to more easily keep track of chores and appointments			0
