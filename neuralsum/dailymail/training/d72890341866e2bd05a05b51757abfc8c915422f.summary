by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's one of autumn / winter 's biggest sartorial trends but the humble knitted jumper was n't always so stylish			0
now a new exhibition is to chart the history of the knit , from lowly beginnings as undergarments and utilitarian gowns to its current high fashion incarnation			1
knitwear @entity13 to @entity14 opens at the @entity15 in @entity16 next month and will include 150 rare pieces , including @entity13 cardigan suits , crocheted 1930s dresses and vibrant knits by @entity21 and @entity22			1
‘ decade by decade , this incredible collection charts over 100 years of knitwear history , ' says @entity44 , head of the @entity15			2
' it is the first exhibition of its kind to explore not only key designers but also technical innovations in hand , machine and industrial knitting			0
' but as the exhibition makes clear , knitwear was n't always so glamorous with knitting and crocheting long associated with functional fashion and undergarments			1
that all changed when @entity59 broke out and wool , one of the first textiles to become scarce thanks to its use in army uniforms , became a luxury			1
by the 1920s , the flexible nature of wool and increasing demand for sportier pieces resulted in knitwear becoming truly fashionable for the first time , helped along by @entity31			1
key to the knit 's new look was @entity13 's championing of jersey , a wool - based machine woven textile , which was traditionally used to make men 's pants			1
@entity13 , however , had other ideas and reworked the material into easy - wearing twinsets and chic frocks - an innovation considered incredibly daring in the heady days of the 1920s			0
later , the material was used to make evening dresses , as was crochet , all enlivened by metallic yarns , deco colouring and exotic details			1
by the time the @entity96 arrived , the jumper was a firm fixture in the fashion firmament but clothing restrictions meant that once more , women had to invent creative ways to wear it			2
many were unravelled and recycled when they became too tatty to bear , with multicoloured jumpers becoming a staple thanks to the reuse of wool taken from other garments			1
@entity109 : a 1920s knitted coat ( left ) and an elegant grey ensemble photographed by @entity38 in 1947 @entity112 : multi-coloured designs such as these 1930s jumpers became popular during the war years that , however , was the final time that the jumper played a purely practical part in women 's wardrobes and almost as soon as ve day arrived , the knit began a trajectory that took it into the heart of the fashion world			1
the late 40s and early 50s saw the ' cocktail sweater ' reign supreme in wardrobes around the world , thanks in no small part to the influence of @entity137 stars who wore theirs nipped in at the waist and embellished with embroidery and beading			0
later , the crocheted cocktail dress became popular , with hems shortening exponentially as the 1960s approached and throughout the decade			0
with @entity13 gone , @entity145 and @entity146 led the charge to champion knitwear , embracing wool and jersey fabrics in their futuristic designs			1
and it was n't just designers who embraced the trend			0
easier to make than the cocktail knit , short dresses became a favourite of young women all over the @entity159 , who knitted their own using patterns published in magazines such as @entity29 and @entity163			2
luxurious : an elegant @entity165 top made from jersey shot through with gold yarn circa 1970 beautiful : a silk jersey duster coat circa 1919 ( left ) and a @entity172 creation dating from the 1970s ( right ) the novelty knit first seen during the war years reappeared in the 70s , this time featuring bright colours and kitsch motifs , popularised by @entity178 and @entity179			1
the 1970s were also a fertile era of fashion design , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 for @entity185 , @entity22 and @entity186 all championing knitwear			2
but it was n't until the 1980s that knitwear in its current incarnation really took off , with @entity14 , @entity191 for @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 all creating sophisticated collections based on the formerly humble jumper			0
by the time the 1990s and the noughties rolled around , knitwear was an established part of fashion although it has n't completely lost its ability to astound			2
from @entity203 to @entity204 and @entity205 , the jumper continues to inspire fashion 's hottest names - and those who buy them			0
' knitwear in fashion is often taken for granted , ' comments @entity44 , ' but this exhibition is an opportunity to celebrate knitwear centre stage and to inspire future design directions			2
' curator @entity215 added : ‘ knitwear is imbued with narrative and memory			0
this exhibition is a way of accessing other people ’s stories			0
' knitwear @entity13 to @entity14 opens on the 19th september at the @entity223 and @entity224 in @entity16			0
