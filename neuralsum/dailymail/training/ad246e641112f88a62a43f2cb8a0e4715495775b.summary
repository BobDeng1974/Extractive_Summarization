by @entity0 i could n’t believe my luck when i was recently asked to be on the cover of @entity4			1
for anyone who has n’t worked in the city , the luxury monthly mag is the @entity8 for all the city boys ( and girls ) – it ’s all about the movers and shakers of the financial world as well as all things fashion , styling , and dining			0
so it came as a bit of shock to be asked to appear on the cover , as well as a great privilege – the previous cover star was @entity24 for his @entity26 launch , so clearly they must have had a quiet month in order to choose me for the march issue			1
many city firms have first day initiations for their new apprentices to go through and @entity34 editor @entity48 made me reveal mine			1
i was pretty much the only posh bloke in a room full of @entity51 wide - boys			0
there were four guys starting on the same day and we were made to undertake a gruelling lunch challenge			1
it was four @entity57 , four large chocolate muffins , four cans of lager , and one conference room			0
we were all sat down in from of this haul of food and drink and the whole office put money in a jar and bet on who could consume the lot in the fastest time			2
before filming made in @entity38 , @entity0 used to turn up at his desk job at 5:45am every morning only one guy in a office of about a hundred people bet on me			1
my plan for the @entity75 challenge was to go slow and steady , i figured that anyone who flew out of the traps too quickly would suffer difficulty later down the line			2
and that ’s exactly what happened , one took the lead very quickly but then went green and had to retire from the race			0
the other two raced ahead but i caught them both up in the final lap and managed the lot in under 25 minutes			0
@entity0 chats to @entity88 , @entity48 @entity0 on the set of his cover shoot for @entity91 i realise that it was a totally juvenile and stupid game but you might as well win it if you can			1
so the prize pot was left to me and the only guy who backed me , @entity96 , who is still a good friend to this day			2
( btw - i would not advise anyone to attempt to beat this record at home , it ’s not big or clever			0
) for a time i was trying to juggle a job in the city and filming made in @entity38 , i was at my desk at work for 5.45am ( the hours are definitely the worst thing about working in the city ) finished at 6pm then onto a taxi - bike across town to @entity38 to film for the show till about 11pm			1
inevitably there would be a few drinks afterwards and what with weekend shoots and quite a bit of partying , i found myself burnt out and also quite overweight – watch series 1 and 2 of @entity0 and it ’s hard to miss. the constant snacking at work was the worst thing but i ’ve now got that under control by using @entity123 in the mornings and afternoons			2
@entity0 says he plans to work on his fitness levels in order to be beach ready this summer i also get deliveries from @entity130 right to my door every day which gives me nutritious low carb meals , and i ’m working out a lot at @entity136 gym with my trainer , @entity139 world champion @entity138			2
i totally admit i ’ve let myself slip a bit since getting in @entity142 cover shape at the end of last year so i ’m making a big push to be beach ready for summer now and i ’m planning a trip to no 1 @entity147 in @entity148 to take off any rough edges			0
one thing i certainly wo n’t be doing is having four @entity57 for lunch any time soon			0
the full article on @entity0 is in @entity153 of @entity34 out now			1
