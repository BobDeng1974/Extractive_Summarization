from the shedding of skin to smelling with their tongues , snakes fascinate humans for many reasons			2
but one reticulated python has given us a new reason to be amazed , because she has produced six babies - without mating			1
@entity15 the snake 's virgin birth , through a process known as parthenogenesis , is the first to be documented in the world ’s longest snake species			1
a reticulated python called @entity15 has produced six offspring , without the help of a male			1
the virgin birth , or parthenogenesis , is the first to be documented in the world 's longest snake @entity28 is fatherless reproduction in animals that usually requires two parents to produce offspring			1
the 11 - year - old reticulated python produced her young in june 2012 at the @entity36 in @entity37 and new research has revealed how the feat was achieved			1
@entity15 lives with another female python called @entity41 and has not had any male company for years			1
the 20ft , ( six metre ) snake , which weighs 200lbs ( 91kg ) laid a clutch of 61 eggs in the summer of 2012			2
the 11 - year - old reticulated python produced her young in june 2012 at the @entity36 in @entity37			1
her offspring are half clones			1
three of them have retained her exact colouring , while the others ( one of which is pictured ) have bright yellow and black patternation known as ' super tiger ' markings a virgin birth is also called parthenogenesis			0
@entity28 is fatherless reproduction in animals that usually require two parents to produce offspring			0
this is the first time that it 's been been documented in the world ’s largest snake , although it 's been observed in other snake species and birds and sharks			1
it ’s caused when cells known as polar bodies – which are produced with an animal ’s egg and usually die , behave like sperm and fuse with the egg , triggering cell division			1
this process is known as terminal fusion automixis			0
the eggs were covered and brooded by the coiled female for two weeks before being removed by zookeepers for examination			0
‘ it is not uncommon for a snake to lay infertile eggs , so the staff was surprised when the eggs appeared to be full and healthy instead of shrunken and discolored shells - typical of infertile reptile eggs , ’ said @entity87 , curator of @entity88 at the zoo			2
a decision was made to artificially incubate some of the eggs to ascertain whether they were fertile			2
on september 12 , 2012 , the first of six healthy reticulate pythons hatched with an average individual weight of 5.23 ounces ( 148.3 grams )			0
dr @entity87 said : it is a very exciting thing to be able to witness something like that first hand , especially something that has never been documented before in this species			0
’ to confirm whether @entity15 's offspring were born via parthenogenesis , shed skins from her and her offspring were sent to the @entity112 ’s molecular ecology laboratory in @entity113			1
genetic testing revealed that the snakelets were produced by the mother ( pictured ) alone , without sperm from a male snake			1
parthenogenesis is caused when cells known as polar bodies – which are produced with an animal ’s egg and usually die , behave like sperm and fuse with the egg , triggering cell division python retiulatus is the world 's longest snake and can measure up to 22.8ft ( 6.95metres ) long			1
they live in @entity132 and like all pythons , are nonvenenmous constrictors and good swimmers			0
the snakes eat mammals ( from rats to pigs ) and birds and can swallow prey up to a quarter of their own length and as heavy as themselves			2
they are ambush hunters and wait until prey wanders within strike range , before seizing it in their coils and squeexing it to death			0
while they are strong enough to kill a grown man , this is very rare			0
females usually lay between 15 and 80 eggs per clutch , which take an avearge of 88 days to hatch			0
hatchlings are typically at least two feet ( 61cm ) long when they are born			0
‘ we did n't know what we were seeing			0
we had attributed it to stored sperm			0
i guess sometimes truth is stranger than fiction , ’ he told @entity158			0
genetic testing revealed that the offspring were produced by the mother alone , without sperm from a male snake			1
it ’s caused when cells known as polar bodies – which are produced with an animal ’s egg and usually die , behave like sperm and fuse with the egg , triggering cell division			1
this process is known as terminal fusion automixis , according to the study published in the @entity181			0
interestingly , despite not having a father , the snakelets are half clones of the mother , with three retaining her pattern , with the others displaying striped of brighter yellow			2
virgin births have been seen in other reptiles before , including other snake species , according to @entity193 , a professor of herpetology at @entity195 in @entity196			0
it is being documented in more and more species , including birds and sharks , mainly due to research by @entity202 at the @entity112			2
he thinks that the discovery in pythons will help scientists learn more about snakes ’ evolutionary family tree and thinks that while no - one knows what causes parthenogenesis , it may have something to do with females being kept in captivity far away from males .			2

the 11 - year old reticulated python lives at @entity36 in @entity37
@entity15 had no *contact* with male snakes but produced fertile eggs
this is down to parthenogenesis , a new genetic study has revealed
it ’s caused when cells known as polar bodies - which usually die - behave like sperm and fuse with the egg , triggering cell division
parthenogenesis has been observed in other snakes , birds and sharks , but this is the first time its been seen in the world 's longest snake
@entity15 produced six offspring that are half clones of herself
