by @entity0 published : 04:30 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 07:27 est , 8 december 2012 two friends died while cooking a pie in a killer oven which is still being used in 7,000 @entity5 kitchens , an inquest heard			1
housemates @entity8 , 30 , and @entity9 , 34 , were killed by lethal carbon monoxide within minutes of turning on the grill made by manufacturer @entity12 , who have previously been criticised for selling fridges freezers which catch fire			1
mr @entity8 's father @entity16 said the tragedy had left a ' huge gaps in our hearts ' and he hoped the pair would be the last victims of faulty equipment			1
@entity9 , pictured left , and @entity8 , right , were killed almost instantly by lethal gases as they cooked a pie in their @entity29 oven at their home in @entity31 @entity12 recalled the product as the cooker has a complete seal around the oven which means if the grill is used with the door shut it can be deadly			1
the @entity40 50 grill begins to produce lethal carbon monoxide because the seal does n't allow any oxygen to get inside			1
the pair were cooking a pie when the oven began releasing the odourless fumes which filled the house in minutes and killed them both			2
at least six other people in the @entity5 have fallen victim to several faulty models of @entity53 , the inquest in @entity49 , @entity31 , heard			1
the @entity29 oven , pictured , which killed mr @entity8 and mr @entity9 has been recalled by the company but it is believed that 7,000 are still in use in the @entity5 @entity12 recalled the ovens , 21,000 of which were sold , but only managed to contact 80 per cent of customers , it was said			1
trading standards officers and @entity12 admit there are still around 7,000 being used in the @entity5			1
mr @entity8 , an administrative officer for the @entity65 , and mr @entity9 , a ground worker , were found dead in their home in @entity68 , @entity31 , in december 2010			1
the inquest heard the cooker was purchased by mr @entity9 's parents from @entity73 's cooperative in @entity74 , @entity75 , in 2008			2
floral tributes were left for the friends outside their home in @entity68 , @entity31 , after they were killed by the lethal gases in 2010 mr @entity8 's father , @entity16 , told the inquest : ' @entity8 and @entity9 had the rest of their lives ahead of them			1
' but their lives were tragically ended by something as simple as a grill door on a cooker			0
' @entity9 and @entity8 have left huge gaps in our hearts and for everyone who knew them we will miss them for everyday of our lives			1
' testing of household appliances is not adequate			0
more time and money must be spent on making sure they are safe			0
' @entity8 and @entity9 are not the first to lose their lives in this way but hopefully they will be the last			1
' in the two months before their @entity29 oven was installed five others had died using its grill in the same way			0
@entity108 engineer @entity107 , who investigated the accident , told the inquest the grill became dangerous if used with the door closed			0
the oven , pictured , started leaking carbon monoxide - a colourless , odourless gas - as the two men tried to cook a pie he said cooker grills should not be operated with the door shut as this limits oxygen and can cause carbon monoxide to be produced			1
some ovens have a safety cut - out to stop that happening and others have an air gap around the door , he explained			2
but the @entity40 50 grill had a door fitted with a complete seal which was a manufacturer 's defect			0
mr @entity107 said it was possible there ' could still be people out there with cookers in a dangerous condition '			0
the tragedy takes to eight the number of @entity5 deaths linked to defective @entity29 cookers all made in the companies @entity144 factory			2
@entity146 officer @entity145 told the inquest that @entity5 oven testing standards have been modified to include tests on grills with the door closed			0
he said the @entity12 appliance could be made safe by a simple modification which involves removing part of the seal			2
@entity12 have also recently been criticised after a faulty brand of its fridge freezer was linked to a series of house fires leaving 15 people injured and one person dead			1
a spokesman for @entity12 said : ' this is a great tragedy and our deepest condolences go to the family and friends of mr. @entity9 and mr @entity8			1
' in november 2008 , @entity12 became aware of a safety risk pertaining to certain models of the @entity29 gas cookers			2
this risk can be eliminated by a simple modification , carried out by our service engineers free of charge			0
' since we became aware of the issue in november 2008 , we immediately launched a corrective action program			0
' that included sending letters to all customers on its database , door - knocking campaigns and advertising in the national and local press			0
they claim that the oven met all testing standards when it was first released			0
he added : ' @entity12 have successfully lobbied to change the testing standards at the @entity192 level to make the testing regime more rigorous			2
' as a result of this extensive activity , a majority of affected models have been located and modified			0
however , 6998 affected units remain untraced in the @entity5			0
' a verdict of accidental death for both men was recorded by a jury at @entity203			0
mr @entity9 's mother @entity204 said : ' @entity9 was a person who loved life			2
