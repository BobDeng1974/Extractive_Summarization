@entity0 has revealed it hopes computers sewn into clothing could help take on @entity6 ’s @entity4 and @entity5 ’s much - rumoured @entity3			1
the electronics giant said it is ‘ investing heavily ’ in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health			2
‘ eventually you wo n’t even know you ’re wearing the device , it could be the fabric in your clothing , your glasses or your watch , ’ @entity0 ’s chief strategy officer , @entity14 , told the @entity16 conference in @entity17			0
the official @entity24 looks similar to this 2009 concept of a @entity0 smart watch , designed by @entity27			0
the firm 's mobile bosses confirmed in march it was working on a watch and the company 's executive vice president confirmed the @entity24 name in august ‘ it will monitor your health , connect to the cloud , identify you , pay for things and replace credit cards			1
’ the firm is currently believed to be developing a range of wearable computers , including a watch			1
‘ in three or four years , the number of people wearing computers will increase dramatically , ’ mr @entity44 said			0
he believes that by 2020 the technology will be widely available			0
@entity0 has previously admitted it is developing a watch and a recent trademark filing suggested that @entity0 's version would be called ' gear '			2
@entity0 will battle @entity5 ’s much - rumoured @entity53 , and @entity6 ’s @entity4 wearable computer			1
developers say the technology is beginning to become acceptable			0
‘ i think we 're starting to see devices that people actually want to wear , and we ’ve seen a dramatic shift in how much sensors costs , ’ said @entity57 of @entity58 , a firm developing a computer watch			0
@entity5 is believed to have 100 people working on its @entity3 , according to recent rumours , but is hiring new members because the existing team have been unable to solve issues with the design and engineering			2
here is @entity76 's mock - up of what the @entity3 could look like @entity0 confirmed it was developing a watch to take on @entity5 's rumoured @entity3 in march			1
the @entity80 giant let its plans slip during an interview - setting the scene for the arch - rivals to do battle in yet another market			0
experts believe both technology giant 's watches will link to mobile phones and offer largely similar functions , such as the ability to show emails and download mini apps			1
' we ’ve been preparing the watch product for so long , ' @entity95 , executive vice president of @entity0 ’s mobile business , told @entity99 during an interview in @entity101			1
' we are working very hard to get ready for it			0
' we are preparing products for the future , and the watch is definitely one of them			2
' the issue here is who will first commercialize it so consumers can use it meaningfully , ' the @entity0 device will perform many of the tasks of a smartphone , a source told @entity118 earlier this year , without giving further details			0
the source declined to be identified because @entity0 did not want to reveal to the public any information about its new product line at this time			0
@entity0 announced earlier this year it was ' investing heavily ' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health			1
another of @entity0 's watch concepts , pictured , shows a solid wooden band , and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running however , an earlier concept developed by by designer @entity27 shows a watch than can be removed from its wristband when running or to answer a call , for example			2
shares in both @entity0 and @entity5 have taken a hit as the world 's top two mobile device manufacturers keep underwhelming consumers with their latest smartphone models			1
@entity0 shares dropped nearly 5 percent , or around $ 10 billion , in just two trading sessions after it launched its @entity147 smartphone in march , partly hit by concerns that its flagship product lacks the ' wow factor ' and may not live up to expectations			0
the @entity152 , unwrapped to much fanfare in @entity154 to challenge @entity5 's @entity155 on its home turf , offered some incremental evolutionary improvements , but media reports have since suggested these features may not be sufficient to excite buyers in an industry that lives and dies by innovation			0
the global watch industry is expected to generate more than $ 60 billion in sales this year , and rather like the mobile phone market , firms are expected to try and ' lock ' consumers into their own ecosystem of apps and other downloads			1
@entity0 's watch concept can even be taken out of its strap to answer a call ' the race is on to redesign the mobile phone into something that you wear , ' said @entity179 , an analyst at @entity180 in @entity181 , @entity154			1
' we ’re going to see formidable competition coming from many different directions -- from device makers , accessory makers , even fashion designers			0
' @entity0 became the world ’s largest smartphone maker last year , overtaking @entity5			2
@entity0 had 29 percent of global smartphone unit shipments in the fourth quarter , compared with 21 percent for @entity5			2
experts believe the new watches could kickstart the mobile phone market , in the same way that the tablet market exploded when @entity5 introduced the @entity196 .			1

@entity0 said it is working on wearable computers but did not confirm the existence of its rumoured watch
@entity5 and @entity0 are believed to be preparing products to go on sale within months
watches will link to an owner 's mobile phone and offer email and app downloads
