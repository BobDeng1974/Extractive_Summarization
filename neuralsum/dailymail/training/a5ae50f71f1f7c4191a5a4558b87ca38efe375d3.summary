on the day of the accident in april 2011 miss @entity34 said she could only get inside by holding a fence before she saw the trench with material piled alongside it			2
' i saw a young boy digging in the trench close to a small digger , ' she told the hearing			0
' it was up to his shoulders			0
i would say it was up to five feet			0
' i thought to myself , " that looks dodgy "			2

' killed : @entity9 with his girlfriend @entity61 , who was eight months pregnant when he died pictured : police at the site			1
council building inspector @entity34 told the inquest : ' i saw a young boy digging in the trench close to a small digger			1
it was up to his shoulders ... i thought to myself " that looks dodgy " ' the trench on the site , which was run by the @entity11 - based firm @entity75 , was being dug to connect utility pipes from two new bungalows to the mains			1
the labourer from nearby @entity35 , whose girlfriend was eight months pregnant , was self - employed and had been working for the company laying pipes for just two days			0
