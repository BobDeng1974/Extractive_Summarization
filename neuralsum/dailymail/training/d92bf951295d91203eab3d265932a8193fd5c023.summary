by @entity0 the elderly alpha male of the only brown bear colony in the @entity3 is facing castration after officials discover he has been breeding with his own offspring for the past two decades			1
pyros the bear 's ' sexual domination ' of the colony of 30 - odd bears living near @entity11 , @entity12 , has seen him end up the father , grandfather and great - grandfather to every cub born in the colony for the past 20 years			1
@entity12 officials are now facing the difficult decision of either castrating or capturing 26 - year - old @entity20 in order to stop the dangerous level of inbreeding which is risking the species ' survival in the @entity27 mountain range			2
still going strong : pyros the alpha is risking castration after officials discover he has fathered all the cubs born in the @entity3 brown bear colony in the past 20 years ( file photo ) the bear ’s sexual dominance came to light after @entity12 officials discovered that @entity20 was both father and grandfather to a recent cub			1
at 26 , @entity39 ’ ‘ vigour ’ should have slowed down in his late teens , however , @entity20 remains as active as ever , resulting in dangerous levels of inbreeding in the colony			0
the colony of 30 - odd bears include four other males , but only one is not an offspring of @entity39 ’ and none of them have fathered any cubs , officials found			0
as a result , @entity12 officials say they have to choose between castrating @entity20 and segregating him from the group in order to secure the species ’ survival in the @entity3			1
inbreeding : @entity20 ' sexual appetite and dominance in the group has to be stopped as the limited gene pool is risking the survival of the bear population of the @entity3 ‘ if he keeps up this sexual vigour and dominant attitude for a few more years , the other males in the mountains have no chance of mating with any of the females , ’ @entity64 environmental councillor @entity63 , told @entity65 , according to @entity66			1
if @entity20 is not castrated he would have to be moved , however , due to his old age , sedating and moving him to a new area – wild or in captivity – could cause fatal stress and other risks to his health			2
a representative from the @entity81 regional government told the paper that even if @entity20 is sterilised and left with the colony , his dominant sexual behaviour could continue , making it difficult for the other males to mate with the females of the group			0
mr @entity63 said he hopes that the introduction of a new bear to the colony could help , but it is also possible that @entity20 ’ family jewels can be saved if his biological clock finally begins to tick and he starts to act his age			0
local authorities have long fought to save the brown bear population of the @entity3 by transferring brown bears over from @entity98			0
the last indigenous female brown bear in the mountain range , which forms the natural border between @entity103 and @entity12 , was shot by a hunter in 2004 .			0

pyros the alpha bear may have to be castrated to save the species
despite his old age , his sexual dominance in the @entity3 is not *fading*
@entity20 is father , grandfather and great - grandfather to nearly all cubs
