anti-mosquito apps emit ultrasonic frequencies designed to mimic predators and frighten mosquitoes the muggy weather is creating a ‘ perfect storm ’ for mosquitoes to descend on our gardens			1
but the latest high - tech weapon in the battle against the bloodsuckers does n’t come in the form or a spray or clip , instead it ’s a free app on your smartphone			2
anti-mosquito apps emit ultrasonic frequencies designed to frighten the mosquitoes away			1
they do this by either mimicking the sounds of mosquito predators , such as dragonflies and bats , or by using the sound made by the wings of male insects			1
once a female mosquito has mated , she is said to actively avoid contact with males , so by playing this sound , the females stay away			1
the most popular app is called the @entity33			0
its developers claim that the pitch of the sound it produces is so high , most humans do n’t notice it			1
it also comes with various frequencies in order to target different mosquito species within specific locations			1
although , the app does not guarantee 100 per cent protection , because ‘ there are more than 3,500 known mosquito species in the world and they all react slightly different to the repellent ’			2
other apps that play ‘ mosquito sounds ’ are designed to annoy people , rather than repel mosquitoes but have been found to serve that purpose by accident			1
the official name for such apps , and other similar technologies , is electronic mosquito repellents , or @entity61			1
experts have expressed concern about using these apps as a standalone repellent , however			2
research from the @entity67 found ‘ no evidence of an effect of @entity61 on landing rates			1

' @entity79 is pictured @entity80 , which is among the diseases carried by mosquitoes , kills more than 600,000 people a year and 90 per cent of them live in @entity84			0
@entity85 recently shared an infographic to highlight the world 's 15 deadliest animals , based on the number of humans who die from coming into contact with them every year			0
it revealed the mosquito - @entity94 for ' little fly ' - kills more people than all the other animals listed put together			0
' thus there is no evidence that these @entity61 could potentially be useful in preventing malaria in humans			0
’ there is also said to be little evidence female mosquitoes avoid males after they ’ve mated			1
the @entity67 researchers added that ‘ male mosquitoes are actually the ones attracted by the female flight sound , and females normally have a very weak sensitivity for sound compared with the males			1
’ @entity113 , associate research professor in @entity114 at @entity115 added mosquitoes are also not know to leave areas hunted by dragonflies			1
reviews of the app additionally state that the sound is audible and ‘ annoying ’			0

footage , filmed by @entity141 scientists earlier this year under a microscope , revealed how a malarial mosquito bites and sucks blood from an anaesthetised mouse			0
it seems that when a mosquito bites , it does n’t just draw blood , but in fact probes around under the skin to find a blood vessel , usually for several minutes at a time			2
the video , captured by a team at the @entity156 in @entity157 , reveals the incredibly flexible mouthparts of a mosquito that can bend at right angles .			0

anti-mosquito apps emit frequencies designed to frighten mosquitoes
some mimic the sounds of mosquito predators , such as dragonflies
others use the sound made by the wings of male insects , which females avoid once they ’ve mated
experts have *warned* the apps do n’t effect landing rates
@entity114 added there is no evidence females avoid males after mating
