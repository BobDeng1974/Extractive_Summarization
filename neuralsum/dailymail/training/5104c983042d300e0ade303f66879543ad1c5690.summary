@entity2 eventually moved to @entity18 as part of a £ 5million deal which led to @entity49 going the other way			2
revelations ( in his own autobiography ) of @entity2 's wage demands also did not help his perception among ordinary football fans			1
the passage in his book about his agent 's contract negotiations with @entity1 chairman @entity60 , was savaged by supporters and the media			1

this animosity led to him being booed by @entity8 fans during a match at @entity103 against @entity104 , as well as being a poster boy for everything that was wrong with the game ( although it should be pointed out , for balance , that he was named @entity8 fans ' player of the year for 2010 )			1
he was seen as mocking the @entity114 's @entity113 campaign in 2008 when he deliberately turned his back on @entity116 in an act of dissent as the referee was trying to caution him			0

@entity148 and @entity149 may also be interested			0
his lunch partner in @entity152 , @entity7 , might find it a bit more difficult to find a new club			2
