students the world over have always fought with each other , but when the dust - ups appear on social media it just makes for bad pr for the school involved			2
this is why @entity9 in @entity10 is trying to shut down a @entity12 page created by their students dedicated to showing fights at their school			1
however , @entity12 has shown they ’re also up for a scrap and have refused to bow to pressure from the college to shut down the page			1
@entity21 reported that the principal and parents at the @entity10 high school have demanded that the @entity12 posting showing the playground brawls be taken down			1
a concerned parent contacted @entity12 asking for the page to be removed because of its brutal content but they were adamant that the page did not breach its standards			2
in one video on the @entity44 page on tuesday , two year nine students from @entity41 are shown punching and kicking each other			1
they 're being cheered on by other students who can be heard in the background encouraging the fighters on by shouting : “ go … fight , fight , fight ”			0
both students in the latest video were suspended			0
one student gets knocked back by a punch during the brawl at the @entity10 high school in an interview with the @entity57 , @entity55 condemned the school - yard attack and requested @entity12 take it down			1

' from our point of view the issue ’s been dealt with appropriately			0

' we have approached @entity12 and we initially received a negative response from @entity12 saying what 's on the page was within the guidelines of their operating system , ' he explained			0
parents of students were furious that the fights could be viewed on facebook ' however early this morning i have received information the @entity12 page is still up , but the information has been taken down			1
' despite this though , a replacement ' fight ' page has already been put up by students			1
all of which calls into question exactly how much parents know about what their children are uploading onto the likes of @entity12 , and whether it is appropriate			0

our students are clearly more advanced ... with this sort of technology , ' mr @entity55 told the @entity57			0
the stunned student tries to get to his feet after coming off second best in the fight at @entity9 ' part of it is monitoring ... and sitting and talking with students about the types of things going on social media			2
