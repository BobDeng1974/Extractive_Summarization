a landlord is asking for £ 780 a month for a ' studio flat ' so tiny occupants need to stand on top of a fridge and climb a ladder to get into bed			2
and once they mount the platform to where - to quote so many @entity9 episodes - ' the magic happens ' any bedroom gymnastics would have to involve a significant amount of contortionism			2
there is less than two feet of space between the top of the mattress and the ceiling			1
yet the appearance of this young professionals ' rabbit hutch on the market - and others like it , or smaller - is raising questions about whether such properties are fit for human habitation			2
the @entity23 studio , which includes an ensuite @entity41 , is converted from a single room in a terraced house			1
its main room measures a not - so - ample 9ft by 8ft , slightly larger than the average 6ft by 8ft prison cell			1
the @entity48 viewed the property , and its reporter , @entity50 , says it boasts an inspiring view of a brick wall			1
nevertheless , lettings agent @entity53 told her it had received 50 to 60 enquiries from hopeful tenants			2
it is just one of thousands of studio flats advertised for rent in the capital , where an apparently runaway housing market is reaching fever pitch , apparently detached from the situation across the rest of @entity67			0
@entity68 provided courtesy of @entity70 the flat consists of a a bed jammed into a single room alongside a five square - foot kitchen there is now a gap of more than £ 200,000 between a property in the @entity67 ’s largest city and elsewhere – where the average price of a home is just £ 185,478 - after a record 25.8 per cent price increase in just a year			1
rents , which link more closely to wages , have not even increased half as much - 10 per cent in a year , the @entity48 says			2
but the @entity23 property shows where things are going : less for more			1
authorities have stepped in to stem some of the worst abuses			0
last month , @entity91 reported how a tiny @entity24 flat advertised at more than £ 730 - a - month was taken off the market after @entity93 stepped in			1
it consisted of a a bed jammed into a single room alongside a five square - foot kitchen			1
announcing the ban , cllr @entity98 , the @entity99 's executive member for housing , told @entity102 : ' this place is a shoebox , not a flat			0
' cramped : the floorplan shows how small the property is , at just 8ft by 8ft tenants desperate for a home in a central location had been undeterred			0
the flat in a former council property had been successfully let out for £ 737 - a - month days before the ruling			2
yet the law has virtually no provision to stop flats being let out because they are too small - the @entity99 flat was found to have breached planning laws			0
@entity119 , a property litigation partner at @entity122 law firm , told the @entity48 : ' under the @entity123 1985 , any property let by a landlord on an assured shorthold tenancy must be " habitable "			0
' that means it must be sanitary , clean and a fit place to live - but there 's no requirement about space			1
' the street in @entity23			1
it is just one of thousands of studio flats advertised for rent in the capital , where an apparently runaway housing market is reaching fever pitch @entity67 now has the smallest new flats in western @entity142 , according to the @entity143			0
it launched a campaign last year calling for an end to ' rabbit hutch @entity67 ' and saying the average new one - bedroom flat is now smaller than a @entity150 carriage			0
but as a carriage on the jubilee line is a princely 495 square feet , most of those pictured in this article are likely to be far smaller than that			0
and that size is still 100 square feet larger than the minimum size of a one - bed flat recommended by the @entity160			1
@entity162 presenter @entity161 fronted the campaign , saying : ' this is n't rocket science			0
we all instinctively respond to the opportunity for a view , a connection with the outdoors , fresh air , light and space			1
' a return to minimum space standards is crucial for the health and wellbeing of the people who will be living in new build homes			0
' but mr @entity161 's comments , almost a year ago , came before yet another surge in @entity24 house prices			2
the @entity183 said a typical home in the capital is worth £ 459,000 , 24.8 per cent more than in january 2008			0
it is not only flats that are up for grabs			0
in april a ramshackle building next to an industrial estate in south @entity24 , whose most prominent use was to park the mayor of @entity195 's car , sold at auction for £ 550,000 after a bidding war - three times its estimate			1
parking spaces have also boomed in price , with a single space offered in a car park under the @entity203 in @entity204 , west @entity24 , for £ 400,000			1
speaking about the surge in expensive studio flats to let across the capital , @entity205 , campaigns director for the homeless charity shelter , told @entity210 last month : ' the huge cost of private rents in the capital and tough competition for homes means that many renters have no choice but to take the first place they can afford , whether they are in poor condition or far too small for them and their families			0
' the mayor needs to get serious about building the affordable homes we desperately need , or times will keep getting tougher for generation rent			0

two - room dwelling near @entity23 , @entity24 , includes an en - suite @entity41
but there is just two feet of head space above its ' *mezzanine* ' bed
and the view from its *window* takes in a brick wall
still , letting agents say they have had dozens of enquiries about it
