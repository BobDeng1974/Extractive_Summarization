@entity1 manager @entity0 was at his most hyperactive as last season 's @entity3 finalists were given a major shock in @entity6			1
@entity10 's 57th minute strike was the least the @entity11 deserved in a fiery encounter that saw arm - waving @entity0 argue with the fourth official , former @entity8 man @entity7 sent off and 10 yellow cards			1
@entity1 sub @entity15 was also booked late on after becoming involved in a scuffle in which he shoved @entity19 - @entity18 @entity21 's sensational strike earned @entity6 a 1 - 0 win in the first leg of the last - 16 clash against @entity1 the 21 - year - old @entity26 forward ( left ) celebrates with team - mate @entity27 ( right ) after making it 1 - 0 @entity6 keeper @entity29 ( centre right ) makes an impressive save from @entity1 's @entity32 ( centre left ) @entity15 - who came on as a 64th minute substitute - ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity6 's @entity36 @entity6 : @entity29 , @entity37 , @entity27 , @entity38 , @entity36 , @entity39 ( @entity40 68 ) , @entity41 , @entity21 ( @entity42 87 ) , son , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 80 )			1

red card : @entity7 75 referee : @entity74 it was n't a good night overall for the @entity76			0
emir @entity27 hit the @entity1 crossbar and @entity1 striker @entity78 forced to clear off the line as the @entity81 champions looked a pale shadow of the side who came within seconds of @entity86 glory last season before losing in extra-time to neighbours @entity89			2
with @entity92 target @entity39 pulling the strings for @entity6 , the home side dominated in their all - red strip roared on by a vociferous capacity crowd of 30,000			2
the arm - waving @entity0 bellowed at his defenders when @entity27 hit the woodwork from 25 yards and then complained to delegates when his skipper @entity61 was taken out by two @entity11 defenders			0
tempers were frayed on both sides with @entity6 defender @entity38 booked for jostling referee @entity74 after being penalised for a foul			2
@entity6 were rewarded when a clever back - heel by @entity44 set up @entity21 who lashed his finish into the roof of the net from 10 yards			1
@entity0 responded by sending on @entity1 's prodigal son @entity15 for his first @entity3 action for 10 months			1
@entity15 had a 75th minute header ruled out because @entity1 's corner had gone out of play and then @entity7 picked up a second yellow for a crude lunge at @entity115			1
@entity1 , third in @entity81 , turned up at the @entity117 as favourites but were immediately pinned back by a red tide			2
they knew @entity6 were up for it when holding midfielder @entity39 made a rare venture forward and though he sent his shot wide , an excitable @entity0 came to the edge of his technical area to wave his arms furiously at his defenders			0
the experienced striker ( left ) challenges for the ball with @entity6 utility man @entity37 ( right ) @entity1 boss @entity0 looks on during the first half of his side 's @entity3 clash at the @entity131 @entity0 ( right ) - as well as his coaching staff - clashed with @entity6 boss @entity133 during a fiery encounter the 44 - year - old looks on frustrated during the second half of his side 's narrow defeat against @entity6 @entity15 ( right ) and his @entity1 team - mates are incensed after the @entity140 's headed goal was disallowed with 15 minutes remaining @entity15 continues his protests as he asks the official behind the line exactly why his goal was ruled out it did n't have any immediate effect			1
in @entity6 's next attack after 12 minutes , @entity36 's strike was goalbound until centre - forward @entity65 produced a timely hoof off the line			1
@entity1 were seconds away from completing a @entity81 - @entity3 double last may , conceding a late equaliser in the @entity86 final to @entity154 went on to win 4 - 1 in extra-time			1
top scorer @entity156 has since departed even though @entity15 is back and was among the subs last night , their usual intensity was more than matched by their @entity11 opponents			0
leverkusen are sixth in the @entity161 and with skipper @entity39 marshalling the side in front of the back - four , they were the better side			0
after 25 minutes , the @entity1 crossbar was left shaking by @entity27 's piledriver that had goalkeeper @entity55 beaten			1
as the @entity76 grew increasingly rattled , @entity7 – a former @entity8 man - was booked for a cynical trip in midfield which did nothing to restrain @entity0 's routine on the touchline complete with oustretched arm gestures and exasperated shouts			0
it was n't just him though – @entity6 were so frustrated at not making their supremacy count , five of them angrily surrounded mr @entity178 for awarding a foul against @entity38			0
@entity7 ( left ) is given his marching orders from the referee after receiving his second booking of the evening @entity44 ( middle ) consists a decision with referee @entity74 during the game on wednesday evening @entity1 striker @entity65 reacts after receiving a blow to his face during the first half of the encounter the former @entity8 striker applauds the travelling support after a disappointing night for him and @entity1 @entity192 ( left ) hugs match - winner @entity21 after the game as the hosts secured a shock win over @entity1 the @entity198 defender was so incensed he appeared ready to push the official over until a yellow card waved in his face forced him to back off			1
@entity1 's first proper chance arrived after 39 minutes when keeper @entity29 had to claw the ball away as @entity204 international @entity32 was set to head in @entity62 's cross			2
and just before half - time , he made an even better save from @entity7 with his left hand that had @entity1 's @entity208 international still holding his head as he walked off for half - time			2
they were rare forays though			0
the irony is that @entity6 were less dominant in the second half but that is when they scored with @entity215 almost breaking the back of the net with his finish			0
@entity219 almost added a second and the bad blood lasted until the final whistle when @entity15 was chopped by @entity27 and sought retribution by shoving @entity223 when he got up			0
it looked like @entity15 had got the wrong man but was booked for his trouble .			0

@entity6 will take a lead into the second leg of their last - 16 @entity3 tie against @entity1
@entity21 's stunning strike 12 minutes after the break earned the hosts a *crucial* first - leg lead
@entity1 conceded their first goal in six @entity3 matches as a result
@entity15 had a goal disallowed with 15 minutes to go , although the call from the official was *debatable*
the two sides meet at the @entity245 for the decisive leg on march 17
