the five former staffers said they hold no ill will toward the @entity10 congresswoman , but they could not continue working for her because the national campaign team had been ' rude , unprofessional , dishonest , and at times cruel ' to them			2

the letter went on to tell how they had all been full - time , paid employees until september 11 , when they were asked to temporarily go ' off payroll ' due to financial concerns			2
mrs @entity4 's @entity3 campaign manager , @entity30 , voluntarily took himself off payroll at the beginning of september until the end of the campaign because funds were so poor			1

they want to call names , that 's their prerogative			1
we wish them the best			0
' ' it is disheartening when members of the staff or volunteers or people who are working with the team decide to communicate with the media as opposed with the campaign , ' ms @entity44 continued			0
' we have n't heard anything from these people			0
it is unfortunate they chose to make it in such a public way			0
' however , the staffers made clear they tried to inform people within the national operation of their concerns well before they issued the press release			0
mrs @entity4 's campaign manager , @entity91 , sought to discredit the authenticity of the people behind the letter			1
' the unauthorized news release was sent by a person who does n't even work for the campaign and has never had authority to speak on behalf of the campaign , ' he said			0
' we are not responding to comments made by a person who was not even a staff member in @entity3			0
' ms @entity44 said that while the @entity3 operation was important , winning @entity48 was the primary focus for mrs @entity4 and her campaign			2
' first and foremost , we have to get through the important first caucus state , ' ms @entity44 told @entity62			0
' that 's what she 's focused on			0

earlier this month , seasoned @entity128 pollster @entity133 , who served as an adviser to mrs @entity4 , and senior policy adviser @entity135 left her 2012 campaign			2
since winning the @entity48 straw poll in august , mrs @entity4 's poll numbers have been on the slide and according to the latest @entity141 poll , constucted between october 3 - 7 , she has just five per cent support for the nomination			2
@entity145 words : the press release which accuses mrs @entity4 's national team of rudeness @entity116 , on 20 per cent , @entity149 , 18 per cent , and @entity115 , 15 per cent , are out in front			1
