too much , too soon ? according to a group of teachers and academics , these children should n't be starting school until the age of six or seven and not at four or five as the system currently requires children should not start primary school until they are six or seven - years - old , according to a coalition of education experts who warn of the damaging pressure to perform in class at a young age			1
a letter written by 130 teachers , academics and authors said the @entity18 should follow the @entity20 model and put off formal lessons for two years			1
under the @entity18 ’s current system , children start full - time schooling at the age of four or five			1
experts say this is causing ‘ profound damage ’ in a generation which is not encouraged to learn through play			1
but the call was last night dismissed by as ‘ misguided ’ by a spokesman for the education secretary @entity33			1
children in the @entity18 are obliged by law to be in school aged five , which the lobby group said is creating a ‘ too much , too soon ’ culture			0
the warning singled out recent government proposals which mean five year olds could be formally tested from the beginning of their schooling			2
under the current system , children are first assessed at the age of seven			1
but under deputy prime minister @entity49 ’s proposals , a ‘ baseline ’ test could be introduced in the first year of primary school			0
the group of experts warned that monitoring a pupil ’s progress from such a young age promotes stress and fear around learning			0
the letter said : ‘ the continued focus on an early start to formal learning is likely to cause profound damage to the self - image and learning dispositions of a generation of children ’			1
a spokesman for education secretary @entity33 said the group who wrote to the @entity70 are promoting ‘ bogus pop - psychology			2
’ overwhelming : according to the group , starting formal lessons too early creates a fear of learning and puts too much pressure on younger children these people represent the powerful and badly misguided lobby who are responsible for the devaluation of exams and the culture of low expectations in state schools , ’ the spokesman said			2
sir @entity87 , former children ’s commissioner and one of those to sign the letter , said countries where children start school later , see better results			0
he said : ‘ if you look at a country like @entity99 , children do n’t start formal , full - scale education until they are seven			0
dismissive : a spokesman for education secretary @entity33 's ( left ) office described the calls as ' misguided ' , while @entity49 ( right ) has suggested ' baseline ' tests for children in the first year of primary school ‘ these extra few years , in my view , provide a crucial opportunity , when supported by well trained , well paid and highly educated staff , for children to be children ’			1
other signatories of the letter include @entity113 , director of the @entity115 at the @entity116 , dr @entity117 , senior lecturer in psychology of education at @entity120 , and @entity121 , director of @entity122			0
the @entity70 said the letter was circulated by the @entity123 , which will launch its @entity124 tomorrow			0
it will reportedly call for reforms including play - based schooling for children between three and @entity129 , the founding director of the movement , told the newspaper : ' despite the fact that 90 per cent of countries in the world prioritise social and emotional learning and start formal schooling at six or seven , in @entity122 we seem grimly determined to cling on to the erroneous belief that starting sooner means better results later			2
' there is nothing wrong with seeking high educational standards and accountability , but there is surely something very wrong indeed if this comes at the cost of natural development			0
' outspoken : former children 's commissioner professor @entity87 was one of those to sign the letter			0
