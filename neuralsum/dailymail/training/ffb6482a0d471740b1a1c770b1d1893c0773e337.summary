the scientists were investigating the effects of non-heme iron , which is the type typically found in plant foods			1
they found over a 10 year period the women who consumed the most of this mineral in their diets had the lowest chance of developing @entity16			2
women who eat plenty of leafy green vegetables could cut their risk of pre-menstrual syndrome by up to 40 per cent the team based at the @entity21 and at @entity22 , believe this is because the iron is involved in the production of serotonin , a chemical that helps to regulate mood			1
@entity16 is the name given to the various symptoms that can occur in the two weeks before a woman 's monthly period			2
these include fluid retention , breast tenderness , mood swings , feeling irritable and loss of interest in sex			0
the study , which is one of the first to evaluate whether mineral intake is associated with @entity16 development , looked at 3,000 women			2
all of the women who took part were free from @entity16 symptoms at the start of the study			0
they completed food frequency questionnaires throughout the 10 year trial at the end of which 1,057 women were diagnosed with @entity16 while 1,968 remained symptom free			0
the researchers , who published their findings in the @entity55 , found that the women who ate the most non-heme iron were much less likely to develop the condition			1

however , women at risk of @entity16 should make sure they are meeting the @entity75 for non-heme iron and zinc			1
‘ the level of iron intake at which we saw a lower risk of @entity16 , roughly greater than 20mg per day , is higher than the current recommended daily allowance for iron for premenopausal women , which is 18 mg per day			1
‘ however , as high iron intake may have adverse health consequences , women should avoid consuming more than the tolerable upper intake level of 45mg per day unless otherwise recommended by a physician			0
’ excessive consumption of iron can , in some people , cause hemochromatosis which occurs when , over many years , iron builds up in organ tissue			0
in its most serious form the condition can cause diabetes , liver cancer , arthritis and heart failure .			0

eating foods high in non-heme iron could cut @entity16 risk by 40 per cent , according to @entity107 researchers
this could be because iron is involved in serotonin production and serotonin regulates mood
eating too much iron can be very *harmful*
