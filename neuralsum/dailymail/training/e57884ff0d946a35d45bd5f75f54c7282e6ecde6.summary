@entity0 , 57 , has a hernia the size of a football which makes it hard for him to walk and causes ' awful ' pain a man with a hernia the size of a football says he was accidentally wiped from the surgery waiting list - and has now been told there 's no funding to treat him			1
@entity0 , 57 , has seen the 30cm by 30cm hernia continue to grow during his eight - month ‘ nightmare ’ and says he can barely walk			1
mr @entity0 , from @entity17 , says he is in ‘ awful ’ pain - and the delay in his treatment has meant the hernia is now too big for standard hernia surgery to be appropriate			1
as a result , he needs a £ 12,000 more complex operation , but has been told funding is not available as the surgery is ‘ not essential ’			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s been a nightmare			2
they ca n’t leave me like this , it ’s just too painful			0
in the morning i can sort of walk about but as the day progresses it gets heavier and by the end i can hardly walk			0
‘ the hernia was painful to start with but i could get about			2
now it is five times bigger and really heavy			0
‘ if i drop something on the floor i ca n't get down to pick it up and i ’m in constant pain			0
‘ the stabbing pain stops me in my tracks and it ’s so sore			0
after 4.30pm every day i spend the rest of the day sitting down because of it			0
’ mr @entity0 , who works for an engineering firm , was first admitted to @entity45 , near @entity46 , with a burst abscess in his bowel in april 2013			1
he credits staff for saving his life during an operation to fit a colostomy bag , but he developed a small hernia as a result			1
surgery to correct it was postponed in november as doctors were n’t happy with the results of an @entity58 – a test used to detect heart problems			2
then in january , the hospital revealed mr @entity0 had accidentally been removed from the waiting list altogether			1
by now , the hernia had got worse , ballooning from around three to four inches to the size of a football			0
and rather than standard hernia treatment , he needs a four to five hour operation to fit a mesh to hold the hernia back			1
he said the doctors appealed to the local clinical commissioning group for a grant to cover the £ 12,000 cost but were only offered £ 5,000 , leaving a £ 7,000 shortfall			1
@entity45 accidentally wiped mr @entity0 from its hernia surgery waiting list			1
the hernia is now so big he has been told standard hernia surgery will not be sufficient and he needs a £ 12,000 operation for which no funding is currently available as it is deemed ' non-essential ' mr @entity0 has hit out at the administration errors that have caused him to fall through the cracks			1
he is particularly concerned as untreated hernias can cause dangerous complications such as a bowel obstruction or interruption to the herniated tissue 's blood supply			0
in a letter to mp @entity90 , he said : ‘ the sheer negligence and incompetence shown to me in the last eight months is quite unbelievable			0
‘ no one seems to care anymore			0
not once have i been asked about this whole situation and how i feel about it			0
’ the hospital trust has apologised for the delay and launched an investigation			0
a statement from the hospital said : ‘ @entity101 and @entity102 would like to apologise to mr @entity0 for the delay in his treatment			2
‘ the trust is conducting a thorough investigation into all aspects of mr @entity0 ’s care and is in contact with him to ensure he is aware of the outcomes of this investigation			2

@entity0 had surgery after suffering a burst abscess in his bowel in 2013
the surgery saved his life but caused him to develop a small hernia
he was put on a waiting list for hernia surgery at @entity45
the hospital then accidentally wiped him from the surgery waiting list
hernia has now grown so big that standard surgery is not appropriate
needs more complex £ 12,000 operation but the @entity130 will only provide £ 5,000
