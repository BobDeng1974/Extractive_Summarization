click here to read @entity2 's full match report from the @entity3 @entity5 midfielder @entity4 is confident @entity6 and @entity7 can fill the void created by injury to star striker @entity10			1
city look like being without the prolific @entity10 for a spell after the @entity13 suffered a knee ligament injury in saturday 's laboured but vital win over @entity16			1
@entity10 , who has scored 19 goals this season , left the field in tears after falling awkwardly following a challenge from @entity22 in the second minute at the @entity3			1
@entity10 was left in tears after suffering ligament damage in @entity11 's win against @entity16 @entity26 international @entity4 ( left ) fires a shot during the @entity29 clash @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) will be asked to fill the void left by @entity10 's injury city are still to learn the extent of the damage , and the 26 - year - old will be assessed in the coming days , but he is highly unlikely to feature in wednesday 's crucial @entity36 clash at @entity37			1
that leaves @entity6 and @entity7 , both of whom have also had fitness issues recently , as the chief men to spearhead the attack			1
@entity6 only returned to action after four games out with a calf injury as a second - half substitute against @entity16 while @entity7 missed the game as a precaution because of a hamstring problem			1
@entity4 said : ' @entity10 has been absolutely outstanding , so he is going to be a massive miss for us			1
hopefully he is back soon			0
' but it is good timing that @entity6 is coming back			2
he is fantastic goalscorer and hopefully @entity7 will be available for midweek as well , so we have got plenty of players			2
' they are not easy shoes to fill , @entity10 's , but with the ability the other players have , i 'm sure they 'll fill his shoes no problem			2
' the @entity5 talisman fell awkwardly after a challenge from @entity22 ( right ) team - mates surround @entity10 as the extent of his injury becomes clear at the @entity3 @entity10 leaves the field and is not expected to be available for the @entity36 clash with @entity37 aside from the @entity37 clash - which will determine whether @entity11 progress to the @entity36 last 16 or not - the upcoming fixtures do not look too daunting			1
@entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , the remaining opponents in december , are all at the bottom end of the @entity29			0
the victory over @entity16 , which came courtesy of a dubiously - awarded @entity83 penalty in the 24th minute , maintained @entity11 's recent momentum and cut @entity86 's lead at the top to three points			1
@entity11 have now won five in succession in all competitions , a marked return to form after a sticky run in october and november			0
@entity4 said : ' it has been pleasing , the momentum we have built since the last international break			2
hopefully we can keep that going for the @entity36 and take that momentum into the @entity96 period coming up			2
' we probably did n't play as well on saturday but it was a different kind of performance			0
we ground it out and you need to do that to be successful			0
' obviously after the ( @entity86 ) result , we knew we wanted to get in touching distance and get them looking over their shoulder			0
' @entity83 strokes home the winning goal from the penalty spot in the 1 - 0 victory @entity11 face @entity37 in the @entity36 on tuesday after drawing 1 - 1 with the @entity109 in the first game the injury to @entity10 dampened the atmosphere and the game never really sparked into life			1
@entity11 went ahead after @entity115 was harshly judged to have fouled @entity4 in the box but the goal did not improve the spectacle			2
@entity10 's replacement @entity119 , a highly - rated @entity121 teenager , almost added a second after fine work from @entity4 but @entity124 somehow saved his goalbound shot with his feet			1
@entity11 generally had the better of the few other chances created but it needed a fine save from @entity129 late on to keep out a well - struck volley from @entity131			0
@entity4 , 28 , said : ' we have played better but you need to win those sort of games if you are going to win the title and we managed to scrap it out			0
' it was all about the win			0
it was massively important to keep the momentum going , especially before @entity37			0
' youngster @entity119 ( left ) impressed after coming on to replace @entity10 at the weekend momentum is something @entity16 do not have after just one win from their last six @entity29 games			1
defender @entity146 told @entity147 : ' i think we gave them a tough game but for me it was a soft penalty			0
' i think if the referee had n't given that penalty it would have been a different game , but you never know			0
' it is part of football , you have to accept it , but it is difficult to get over it			0
