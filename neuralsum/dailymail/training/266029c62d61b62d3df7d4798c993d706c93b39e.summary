when the police come knocking at a suspected drug den , you would n't necessarily expect them to leave a polite calling card			2
but that is exactly what happened when officers left a light - hearted note informing the occupant of a property they had raided that they had ' no cannabis left ' after 72 plants were discovered			1
officers from @entity14 kicked down the door of the house in @entity17 , @entity18 , during the raid , but found nobody was in the property			1
they then altered a printed note saying ' unfortunately you were not at home ' , to leave the polite message			1
police officers left this light - hearted note at a house following a drugs raid in which 72 cannabis plants were discovered a photo of the note was then posted on the @entity32 feed along with the message : ' we ’ve kicked in a door in @entity17 , got 72 cannabis plants , nobody home			1
@entity14 , keeping you in the loop			2
' the tweet proved popular among @entity32 users who had by this morning re-tweeted it 759 times			0
the force , including @entity44 , has an active social media presence , but it has not always been as well - received as yesterday 's post			0
last month , an officer behind the feed got into hot water by advising people being ‘ harassed ’ on @entity51 to close their accounts			0
officers found more than 72 cannabis plants during the raid at the house in @entity17 , @entity18 ( file picture ) it caused a storm among some tweeters , who said it appeared to blame victims for bullying and harassment			1
the tweet was later deleted and an apology - which said that ‘ bullying and harassment is , of course , serious ’ - was posted			0
officers who control the feed were spoken to by @entity14 bosses about their use of social media following the mishap			2
another controversial tweet on the feed , posted in january , said : ' do you live in @entity78 or @entity79 ? hate the @entity14 ? want to brag & rub our noses in it ? rt ( retweet ) if you have drugs & have n’t been caught			0
' it was retweeted around 500 times .			0
