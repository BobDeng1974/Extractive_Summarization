an art collector at the centre of a row over £ 1billion of masterpieces believed to be stolen by @entity5 's during @entity6 is the son of a dealer who pillaged remorselessly on behalf of @entity8 , it has been revealed			1
customs officials in @entity10 seized the paintings from @entity12 , 80 , from his flat in @entity14 but he is fighting to get them back saying they were collected legitimately			1
it has now been revealed that his father @entity16 was involved in the systematic looting of @entity18 across the @entity5 , according to @entity19			1
paintings were seized from the home of @entity12 , 80 , pictured left			1
it is alleged his father @entity24 , pictured right , was involved in the systematic looting of @entity18 a vast portion of this loot was discovered by the ' @entity31 ' section of the @entity32 , tasked with finding the stolen art of @entity34 and restoring it to its rightful owners			1
the @entity31 moved into the @entity38 village of @entity39 in @entity38 in april 1945 and arrested the local @entity5 party leader baron @entity40 who lived in the local castle along with art dealer @entity42 and @entity24 whose house in @entity44 had been destroyed in the @entity46 bombing in february of that year			1
a note from a @entity31 team member found in an archive detailed the astonishing artworks found in the castle : ' rooms containing paintings , tapestries , statues , valuable furniture and documents from the belongings of two notorious @entity10 art dealers were found in the castle			1
' another reads : ' a large room on the upper floor with 34 boxes , two packages containing carpets , eight packages of books … one room on the ground floor containing an additional 13 boxes owned by mr @entity12			1
' most of these boxes contained pictures and drawings			0
pictured : the @entity14 apartment where officials discovered the hidden paintings which could be worth £ 1bn @entity12 , they wrote , was ' an art collector from @entity79 with connections within high - level @entity5 circles			1
he acted on behalf of other @entity5 officials and made many trips to @entity84 , from where he brought home art collections			1
there is reason to believe that these private art collections consist of looted art from other countries			0
' @entity12 was described as an ' art dealer to the @entity93			1
' @entity12 , who would go on to inherit many of these treasures , was 12 at the time and living in the castle with his father			1
@entity16 was quizzed by the @entity98 in june 1945 and they noted he seemed ' extremely nervous ' as if he was not telling them the truth			2
' @entity100 ' by @entity101 and a formerly unknown painting of @entity84 artist @entity103 were both discovered among the £ 1bn artwork that is believed to have been plundered from @entity18 during @entity6			2
' it was during those days that @entity12 , the ' art dealer to the @entity93 , ' reinvented himself : as a victim of the @entity107 , a man who had saved precious artworks from destruction and someone who had never done anything malicious , ' said @entity19			2
@entity12 said : ' i had to decide between the war and the work for museums			2
i never bought a picture that was n't offered to me voluntarily			0
as i heard , laws were also enacted in @entity84 so that @entity18 art collections could be confiscated			2
but i never saw it with my own eyes			0
' loot : @entity98 soldiers are pictured discovering one of @entity125 's enormous art stash during the war			0
although they suspected him of dealing in @entity5 art , they let him go among the paintings that the @entity98 returned to @entity125 in 1950 and which have turned up in the @entity14 trove are @entity132 's two riders @entity131 ( above ) the @entity98 were more interested in @entity133			1
he later complained that they had underestimated @entity12 's role during the @entity5 period			1
in a 1949 letter to a government official , he wrote : ' i was able to prove everything , including , for example , that i was not the main supplier for @entity143 , whereas mr @entity146 , during his short term in office , bought about 3,000 artworks and took over confiscated collections together with his main buyer , dr @entity24			0
' @entity143 was to the be the city where @entity8 intended to build the world 's biggest art museum after the war			0
@entity146 , a museum director from @entity154 , ran the art - buying programme for the @entity143 project from 1943 onward			0
@entity12 worked for @entity8 through @entity146 , who served as a middleman			2
one painting he bought at a rocket bottom price was by the @entity161 painter @entity160 called ' @entity162 of the @entity163			0
' in fact , @entity12 bought the @entity160 in 1935 for 600 @entity165 , much less than it was worth , from a @entity18 called @entity167 , who would later commit suicide			1
after originally confiscating it the @entity98 gave it back to @entity171 in 1950			0
under @entity8 , @entity12 was tasked to sell modern art - ' @entity173 ' it was called by @entity8 - abroad to bring in hard currency for the regime			2
one man he fleeced out of drawings by @entity178 was @entity179 , a @entity18 doctor in @entity79			2
control : @entity8 only liked classical art and held exhibitions of modern ' dissident ' pieces to show @entity10 people what not to like			2
many of those paintings that appeared in those shows have been found in @entity12 's collection @entity19 also discovered @entity12 senior struck up a relationship with @entity193 , a @entity5 in @entity194 , now @entity195 , appointed to appraise the collections of persecuted @entity18 to sell on the open market			1
' it was also @entity193 who obtained the @entity132 painting ' two @entity201 ' for @entity12			0

in 1950 , @entity12 's art was restored to him and he also made off with treasures he had hidden in an old water mill. @entity19 said of him : ' there are many examples of works that @entity12 acquired under questionable circumstances			0
there are also a number of pictures hanging in @entity10 museums today , from @entity236 to @entity154 , that were bought from @entity12			1
there are even pictures that @entity12 bought for @entity8 's museum in @entity143 , which , because of their unclear origins , became the property of the state			0
