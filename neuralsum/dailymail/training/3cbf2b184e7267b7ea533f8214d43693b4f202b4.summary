@entity3 need the money but @entity2 is out of contract in the summer and ready to leave after enduring a strained relationship with the club			1
@entity0 ideally want younger players but , if @entity3 can be tempted with a bid of around £ 3million , they may be able to reach an agreement			1
manager @entity43 also remains keen to bring in another defensive midfielder on loan from abroad			0
he had designs on @entity47 from @entity3 but they are not prepared to deal with @entity34 ’s pending move and @entity49 considering @entity50 as an alternative to other plans			2
@entity53 are looking at a diverse set of targets as they look to replace @entity56			1
chief scout @entity57 watched @entity58 against @entity59 at the weekend and was at @entity60 against @entity61 on tuesday night			1
in demand : @entity53 and @entity63 are among the clubs interested in @entity65 @entity65 is understood to be the object of his attention on saturday while @entity60 ’s @entity68 was the target at @entity70			1
they have made an enquiry for @entity74 ’s 29 - year - old forward @entity73 but , as @entity75 found out earlier this month , he will struggle to gain a work permit as he does not have a dual passport and has not played the necessary games for @entity79			2
@entity53 have also asked about @entity81 ’s @entity80 , as have @entity59 , while @entity84 target @entity82 of @entity85 has been offered on loan , as has former @entity88 striker @entity87 , now 30 and at @entity89			2
@entity82 was in the stands at @entity91 on tuesday night			0

offers have been made from @entity107 sides for @entity108 but @entity109 sees the @entity110 as someone who can help get his message across to the other players and he will stay			0
midfielder @entity114 is likely to join @entity115 on loan later on wednesday			0
@entity75 have been criticised by the sporting director of @entity119 club @entity118 over the proposed transfer of @entity121 that failed to materialise last week			1
the @entity75 had moved to sign the @entity123 defensive midfielder but backed out at the last minute after becoming aware that they could definitely sign @entity125 from @entity126			2
it left 24 - year - old @entity121 ‘ sorely disappointed ’			2
@entity128 said : ‘ i can not understand how a club at that level can negotiate and work in a two - faced way like that			0
@entity121 had a bad saturday night			0
’ @entity75 believe it was more misleading information from the agents involved but there will be a few more upset players like that this week as clubs and agents adopt an almost scatter - gun approach across @entity140			0
new arrivals : @entity75 boss @entity142 with @entity143 ( left ) and @entity125 @entity144 fear they will miss out on @entity146 ’s @entity145 as @entity147 seem to be in pole position			1
@entity59 are also lurking with @entity157 poised to bid again for the injured @entity158 but @entity146 manager @entity159 said : ‘ i would expect @entity145 to go			1
we have accepted a bid from @entity147 , we have accepted a bid from @entity144 and we have accepted a bid from @entity152 , so i would expect him by friday to take up one of those options			1
’ with that in mind , @entity144 have considered @entity165 target @entity163 as a loan from @entity53 but are now leaning towards a move for former @entity169 defender @entity168			1

he remains keen on bringing in @entity181 from @entity61 which may entail @entity182 going the other way			1
swap deal : @entity181 ( left ) could join @entity63 from @entity61 with @entity182 going the other way losing @entity65 would be a blow to @entity58 and manager @entity186			1
@entity75 are unlikely now to make a renewed bid but @entity53 have watched him too			1
@entity186 fears the 27 - year - old may be sold as @entity58 ’ prospective new owners continue to jostle for position			0
the @entity192 consortium led by @entity194 ’s @entity193 were not seen at @entity195 on tuesday night despite being expected			0
