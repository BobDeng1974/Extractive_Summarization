@entity0 is billed as the most romantic of the year			0
and for most couples , it means pulling out all the stops to show their partners just how much they care			0
however , one girlfriend used the special day to break up with her boyfriend - with a cold - hearted message on a petrol station 's advertising board			2
' @entity11 ' paid to display the message at an @entity14 garage in @entity15 because she knew her boyfriend went there every day for his lunch so he would see it			1
cruel : the break - up message was posted on an ad space at an @entity14 garage in @entity15 by ' @entity11 ' not only did she announce that she was breaking up with her partner , she also informed him that she was leaving him for another man			1
the cowardly message reads : ' i ’m leaving you for @entity27			2
your clothes are at your mum ’s			0
i ’ve change the locks			0
' sorry to do this on @entity0			0
' the ad , which has become a social media hit , was spotted by @entity35 who posted it on @entity37 with the caption : ' this has to be the meanest dump ever			2
' not such a great @entity40 ’s day for the man in question here			0
' to get dumped is bad enough , but the humiliation of seeing it displayed at your local petrol station is just one step too far			2
' eagle eye : twitter user @entity35 spotted the break - up message and posted it on the social media site with it quickly becoming an online hit the @entity54 board , upon which the cruel message was displayed , usually advertises snack deals			1
but could this @entity40 's break - up just be an elaborate hoax ? it transpires that @entity60 is a company that specialises in selling advertising space on digital signage screens and is run by none other than entrepreneur lord @entity65 and his son @entity66			1
that 's clever ! @entity69 , who runs the company , and his father sir @entity65 , who is chairman , both tweeted about the message lord @entity65 tweeted a snap of the ad out to his 2.7m followers with the caption : ' have a look at the advert someone took out on one of our screens today … poor bloke ! # @entity84 # @entity54 ' his son @entity66 then added : ' the world 's media seemed to have loved @entity11 's ad			1
you can rent out a screen via ... ' mr @entity35 , who first posted the photo spurring the internet frenzy , is a digital account manager at @entity95			0
spreading the word : the @entity65 men tweeted about the break - up message , which has gone viral and even reached press in the @entity100 and @entity101 after posting the photo , @entity35 added : ' it seems the # amscreen pic has reached @entity101 judging by the recent rt 's ... ' and it appears that the break - up message did n't set ' @entity11 ' back too much - the ad space can be hired out for £ 100 a month .			1

' @entity11 ' posed the message to ' @entity111 ' at an @entity14 station in @entity15
the @entity54 ad usually promotes snack deals and can be rented for £ 100 a month
but could this all just be an elaborate hoax ?
sir @entity65 is chairman @entity60 - the advertising company 's board that the message was posted on
