@entity0 geared up for saturday 's @entity2 qualifier against @entity3 without @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 in tuesday 's training session at @entity10			1
the quintet all sat out of the morning session as a precautionary measure but should all be available to face @entity3			1
they were not the only notable absentees from the training session at @entity10 with @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 all taking part in a modified session due to their @entity25 excursions on sunday			1
those who attended training on tuesday observed a two minutes silence in memory of the 100th anniversary of @entity59 alongside members of the armed forces			1
@entity30 , who is set to earn his 100th cap in saturday 's match at @entity39 , took part in the full session as the @entity0 look to maintain their 100 per cent start in qualifying for the 2016 finals to be held in @entity68			1
the 29 - year - old took over the @entity0 armband following the retirement of @entity72 after the @entity73 this summer , and was elected to lead @entity74 under new manager @entity75 this season			2
while @entity77 accepts such expectation can sit heavy on some shoulders , he is confident @entity30 will continue to rise to the challenge for a few campaigns yet and could challenge goalkeeper @entity84 's landmark @entity0 appearance target at 125			1
@entity85 ( centre ) could make his first start for @entity0 since telling @entity77 he was ' too tired ' to line - up against @entity89 @entity85 started last month 's qualifier on the bench , as a result , but came on to win the decisive free - kick for @entity30 's winner @entity95 ( front left ) will be hoping to earn his first @entity0 cap after being selected in the 26 - man squad by @entity77 ' i think @entity30 is in a very good place at the moment , and he has been a very good player over the past couple of years , ' said @entity77			1
' i made an effort to meet him before i was officially appointed in that two weeks spell where i was doubling up as @entity105 manager			2
' i was interested in what am i going to meet here ? will it be someone who is burning to play ? or someone who will take it as ' well , i will do you a favour for a bit longer if it suits me '			2
i met the man who was burning to play , and that is the way he has been all along			0
' since he has been made captain , i think he has taken an even further step , both at @entity74 and with us			0
' the big question is , of course , as one of the few seniors left in the team , absolutely guaranteed if you like a place in the team , the same at @entity74 , i worry the sense of responsibility is going to weigh him down			0
' we do all we can , myself and the coaching staff , to make sure that will not happen with us , but of course when you take something seriously , it is all very well telling someone to leave your problems behind and do n't worry about them , to get on with your life , it is easy to say , but very hard to do sometimes			0
' @entity0 players observed a two minutes silence during the session on the 100th anniversary of @entity59 the @entity0 squad lined - up alongside members of the armed forces as they observed the two minutes silence @entity30 and @entity77 walked out onto the pitch with members of the @entity152 before observing the two minutes silence @entity77 added : ' that is the danger - sometimes when players take on responsibility , they take on too much and it is to the detriment of their own game			1
' we have seen @entity72 do that on occasions in the past - he cares so much for @entity0 , for @entity164 , sometimes they take it all on their shoulders			2
i think that is very unfair			0
' i do n't care whether you are a captain or @entity170 or ( @entity171 ) @entity171 , i do n't think you can be expected to take all the responsibility on your shoulders			0
' what you should be doing is doing your bit and being as good as you are and inspiring the other players in the team			0
' at the moment @entity30 is coping with it well , but we will have to keep an eye on the situation , as will @entity181 , to make sure it does not weigh him down			2
' but until that time comes we have just got to get on with it and be glad that he is doing the job that we as coaching staff want him to do , and ensure that the other players know there job so well that they are not relying on him to get them out of trouble			0
' @entity85 ( right ) signed autographs to fans who watched @entity0 train ahead of saturday 's clash against @entity3 @entity77 believes @entity30 ( right ) can break @entity84 's record of 125 @entity0 international apperances @entity30 certainly seems to have enough left in the tank to push on through to the 2018 @entity73 in @entity198 , by which time he could well have overtaken sir @entity200 's 49 - goal international record			1
' he is just 29 , so to be honest players can play so much longer than in the past if they look after themselves , ' said @entity77			0
' if we are generous and give him another five years , which is not beyond the bounds of possibility , he should beat @entity84 's record			0
