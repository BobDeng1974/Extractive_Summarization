@entity0 lost the match but did enough to remind why he has won @entity2 in the past and might yet do so again in the future			1
at 1.17am , before the unruly remnants of the @entity7 crowd , he finally succumbed to the barrage of @entity9 in their @entity10 quarter final , going down 7 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 in three hours and 31 minutes			1
by the end @entity0 's spirit was willing but the legs had weakened , as he paid the price for taking three and a half hours longer to get to this match than his opponent			1
@entity0 said afterwards : ' he was definitely physically fresher , the pace of my serve slowed down towards the end			2
my back towards the end stiffened up , it is physically extremely demanding to play him			0
i tried to hang in at the end but was a little bit disappointed how my body reacted , i have trained hard			0
' there was some good stuff in the first two sets , i was down in them but i fought back , i just did n’t play a good first tiebreak			0
' @entity9 added : ' we both gave our best			2
at times the tennis was not that nice , we made a lot of unforced errors , but it was due to the very physical battle in the opening two and a half sets			0
' i did n't expect any less knowing i was going to face @entity0			2
the last five times we played , it was always over three or four hours			0
i 'm very glad to get through to another semi-final			0
' neither player was flawless but there were plenty of magnificent exchanges which frequently pushed the @entity70 to his limits			0
@entity9 , who now plays @entity72 , will surely win this event now			1
there were ample unforced errors and both players went through sporadic lapses and , especially in @entity0 ’s case , the return much outshone the serve			2
there was also much to admire			0
the @entity83 ’s forehand was particularly potent , and he will contemplate what might have happened if he had avoided one of those lapses in the opening tiebreak			0
@entity0 fought hard into the early hours			2
ultimately , however , @entity9 with his seven breaks of serve bossed proceedings and from the second tiebreak never looked like losing			2
@entity0 at least knows he has created something to build on			0
shock and awe : @entity0 was appeared to be having trouble with his eyes during the game tunnel vision : @entity0 was seen struggling with his sight during the game on the move : @entity100 1 @entity9 seemed the fitter of the two players back to his best ? @entity0 proved he is still a major force at @entity2 at full stretch : @entity9 's showed his full range of athletic ability during the contest fine lines : @entity0 at times was just inches short of matching @entity9 too strong : @entity9 is will now face a semi-final test against @entity112 's @entity72 disappointment : @entity0 showed glimpses of his best form but could not sustain it for the entire game unstoppable : @entity0 reacts after @entity9 slams down another serve gracious : @entity0 congratulates @entity9 on his win after the match had finished two years after their epic final in 2012 , the former junior rivals were reunited on the same court at the @entity122 , this time with one of them ranked as the world ’s top player and the other the no 8 seed			1
@entity0 's lower than normal seed being the reason why they were now meeting in the last eight			1
that is not by accident , @entity0 is taking small steps on his way back from surgery while @entity9 has rediscovered the art of winning @entity2 after a period of near misses			1
on a balmy night , the @entity138 was packed to the gunwales and the 27 - year - old @entity83 made the perfect start when his piercing returns resulted in an opening break			0
he was always likely to make inroads on the @entity9 serve but protecting his own was going to be the problem			2
he had dropped it thirteen times coming into this match and the fourteenth was not far behind as @entity9 immediately levelled			1
the inability to gain free points against someone who returns even better than he does saw him go 1 - 4 down - but the damage was swiftly repaired			1
the @entity70 , ever the rolled up ball of @entity155 anger , started ranting at himself in the seventh game and was pressured into several errors to allow @entity0 back in			0
the @entity83 ’s big chance came when be forced a break point at 4 - 4 , but a finely angled serve meant he could only just lay a racket on it			1
breather : @entity0 looked to be feeling the pace during parts of the match on wednesday plenty to ponder : @entity168 and @entity169 watch on as @entity0 crashes out support : @entity0 's girlfriend @entity171 was in attendance and roaring her man on by the time the tiebreak came around they had won 45 points each , but @entity0 could not recover from a dismal start - he hit a double fault followed by a pedestrian 77 mph second serve that got the full treatment			1
the tiebreak was over in a blink of an eye , with the @entity70 taking it 7 - 1 , and @entity9 looked to be in full control when a run of 12 out of 14 points saw him go 3 - 1 up , with @entity0 's net play notably more hesitant than in previous rounds			1
but again @entity0 ’s superb returns meant he was not finished and after breaking back for 4 - 4 - the top seed rightly being given a time violation - he forced a set point at 6 - 5			1
but he could not get enough on the return , was forced back and his attempted lob was put away			0
the tiebreak was the inverse of the first , @entity0 far more purposeful and @entity9 ended up slapping errors in frustration by the end as he went down 7 - 1			1
eyes on the prize : but @entity0 ultimately fell short and crashed out of the tournament hand it to him : @entity9 gestures to the umpire as a point goes against him full crowd : the @entity34 stadium was nearly full as spectators stayed up for the main game while there were frequent mistakes on both sides , @entity9 stayed strong to stem any momentum and broke for 3 - 1 in the third before holding off two break points when his opponent pulled the trigger too early in draining exchanges			1
there was a devil - may - care attitude about @entity0 for the rest of the set as he focussed on energy conservation			2
@entity0 began this tournament cramping against @entity226 and ended it in a similar state , his body creaking at the end as he sought to hold in the fourth			0
he had a break point at the start but the body language sagged and he could not seriously threaten after that			0
the break of serve to seal it came entirely on cue .			0

@entity0 loses 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 to world no 1 *djokovic*
@entity0 admits he was disappointed his fitness faded late in the match
@entity9 took control of the match breaking @entity0 's serve seven times
@entity9 will now face @entity112 's @entity72 in semi-finals
