@entity0 has implored @entity2 fans to show respect while supporting his team , as the @entity5 continue to investigate allegations that referee @entity7 was subjected to homophobic abuse at @entity9 last saturday			1
the union ’s disciplinary officer , @entity10 , was thought to be in contact with a spectator , @entity13 , who has complained about comments made by fans sitting near him — aimed at @entity17 official @entity7 , who is gay			1
in a letter , mr @entity13 referred to ‘ nasty , foul - mouthed , racist , homophobic abuse ’ during @entity2 ’s match against @entity21 , while adding the ‘ vitriol ’ left him feeling ‘ ashamed ’			1
@entity7 , who has been known to joke about his sexuality during matches , responded to the allegations by urging the @entity5 to ban for life anyone found guilty of such abuse , saying : ‘ they need to be told that some behaviour is not acceptable , that crossing the line of what is humour and banter is a fine line , but if you cross it then you have to put up with the consequences			1
’ @entity0 has urged @entity2 supporters to show respect while supporting his side at @entity9 referee @entity7 was allegedly subjected to homophobic abuse at @entity9 last saturday another sell - out crowd will be at hq tomorrow for @entity2 ’s second @entity45 , against @entity46 , and national coach @entity0 yesterday found himself dealing with the alleged misconduct of @entity2 supporters			1
he has made a concerted effort to generate greater noise and fervour in the @entity9 stands , but urged those in attendance to moderate their behaviour towards officials and visiting players			1
‘ generally you want a crowd that is behind the team but respecting the core values of the sport , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ that balance should easily be able to be achieved			2
that is what we feel the crowd give us			2
they give us a huge amount of energy			2
‘ i go back to the core values of what we are about			0
one of those is respect			0
i think we need to show that as a team and as a country to all opposition players , coaches , referees and opposition spectators as well			2
’ @entity80 ( left ) takes a pass from @entity2 number eight @entity82 at @entity83 the @entity2 squad are all smiles as they gear up for their clash with the @entity46 on saturday @entity2 and @entity89 fly - half @entity87 fires out a pass as @entity92 lock @entity91 watches on in reference to the claims @entity7 was abused by @entity2 fans , @entity0 added : ‘ i met @entity7 on friday before the game			1
we had a great conversation about the game and about how we were going to approach the game and i think we all , as international coaches , understand the pressure referees are under			0
we are all under pressure			0
every decision gets analysed — every decision a player makes , every decision a coach makes and every decision a referee makes			0
‘ we have to understand the pressures people are under and be supportive			0
certainly that is all we want to do and achieve with the referees			0
having met @entity7 on friday , we want him to have an enjoyable experience coming to @entity2 and it is a shame if he feels that memory has been tarnished			1

we applaud the stance the @entity5 are taking and the investigation			1
we ’ve worked hard in rugby to get the core values of the sport ingrained in the team and in rugby in general , so there is no place for this whatsoever			1
respecting the kicker , respecting the opposition and all those things you see are important			0
’ @entity5 chief @entity190 endorsed @entity0 ’s view on thursday night , saying : ‘ the @entity5 condemns all discrimination			1
we aim to ensure everyone has the opportunity to enjoy rugby in an environment free from all prejudices			2
we take allegations of abuse very seriously and are investigating			1
if we find sufficient evidence we will take action			0
’ one factor which possibly contributed to the ill - will towards @entity7 in the game was marginal refereeing decisions repeatedly being shown on the big screen			1
a particularly close call , which led to a try for @entity21 ’s @entity207 , prompted sustained anger among home fans after footage was shown several times			1
following the game , @entity21 coach @entity211 decried what he suggested was the scourge of tv producers dictating the officiating process , in favour of the hosts , by screening contentious moments until there is a referral to the @entity221			0
in this case , the live feed at @entity9 was supplied by @entity170			1
@entity80 gets through a warm - up exercise with his @entity226 and @entity2 team - mate @entity225 ( left ) @entity129 ( left ) leads his fellow @entity2 team - mates through a speed drill at the team 's training base in @entity231 @entity0 was at pains to emphasise this is not a matter of @entity236 propaganda at work , but a global issue			1
‘ generally there are more screens in stadiums now and more decisions that get replayed , ’ he said			0
‘ in the @entity46 v @entity21 game ( during the @entity245 ) there was an incident which was constantly replayed and @entity248 ’s attention was drawn to it			2
‘ he went back to look at it and it was a penalty			0
it is more for debate at a higher level about the rights and wrongs of that			0
‘ it is not exclusive to @entity9			2
i do n’t have any input at the moment ( into what is shown on the big screen )			0
it is all new technology and it is more a decision for the people who run the sport and the @entity221 debate has to be discussed as technological advances come in			0
‘ a lot of countries have high - definition screens and you can see replays from different angles			0
in football they do n’t allow it at all			0
so it is not for me to decide or get involved in it in the middle of this series			0
’ another disruption in the build - up to tomorrow ’s encounter with the @entity46 is the news that @entity288 ’s players have considered boycotting their match at @entity9 a week tomorrow , due to unrest over pay and alleged managerial incompetence			1
however , @entity0 played down the threat , saying : ‘ i was aware of it a couple of weeks ago as something that was potentially an issue , but my understanding is it has all been resolved			2
