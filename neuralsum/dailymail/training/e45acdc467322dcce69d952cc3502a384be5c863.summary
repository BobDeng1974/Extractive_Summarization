by @entity0 @entity5 ’s @entity1 - an enormous tempest raging on the side of the planet - was expected to dissipate rapidly , but hundreds of years on , it is still one of the solar system ’s most recognisable and mysterious features			1
scientists were unsure why the giant spot has prevailed , but now a team of @entity14 researchers believe they have solved the mystery , using computer models			0
they think the vertical motion of the gases holds the key to the @entity1 ’s persistence by restoring part of its lost energy			1
the giant storm on the surface of @entity5 ( pictured ) should have disappeared centuries ago , based on scientists ' understanding of fluid dynamics			2
the turbulence and waves in the @entity1 sap the energy of its winds and it loses more energy by radiating heat the giant storm on the surface of the gaseous planet should have disappeared centuries ago , based on scientists ’ understanding of fluid dynamics			2
@entity40 , a postdoctoral fellow at @entity41 , said a number of processes combine to dissipate vortices like the @entity1			1
the turbulence and waves in the violent storm sap the energy of its winds and it loses more energy by radiating heat , which should have caused the spot to fade away , @entity45 reported			0
the spot sits between two strong jet streams that flow in opposite directions and slow down the spot ’s spinning , he explained			0
the duo believe vertical motion is critical to explaining why the @entity1 still exists			1
they said that as the vortex loses energy , the vertical flow draws in hot gases from above and cold gases from below to its centre , which replenishes part of its lost energy			0
this image was taken by @entity70 's @entity69 probe dr @entity40 said : ‘ based on current theories , the @entity71 should have disappeared after several decades			2
instead , it has been there for hundreds of years			0
’ together with @entity74 , a professor of fluid dynamics at the @entity76 , he built a computer model to examine forces that previous models ruled out , such as vertical flows and vortices			2
unlike previous models , their model was also three dimensional and in high resolution			0
‘ in the past , researchers either ignored the vertical flow because they thought it was not important , or they used simpler equations because it was so difficult to model , ’ he said			0
however , they believe vertical motion is critical to explaining why the @entity1 still exists			1
they said that as the vortex loses energy , the vertical flow draws in hot gases from above and cold gases from below to its centre , which replenishes part of its lost energy			0
some scientists have previously claimed the @entity71 gets its energy by absorbing smaller vortices , but some computer models have shown that this does not happen enough to explain the @entity1 ’s endurance			1
dr @entity40 and professor @entity74 think their research could also explain oceanic vortices ( pictured ) on @entity105 , which can last for years , as well as those that contribute to star and planet formation			1
this waterspout was photographed above the @entity109 in the northern @entity110 , in 2007 dr @entity40 and professor @entity74 said that while their model does not completely explain the mystery of @entity5 ’s @entity71 , they assume that the absorption of occasional smaller vortices also plays a role in its endurance			2
they think their research could also explain oceanic vortices on @entity105 , which can last for years , as well as those that contribute to star and planet formation			1
they will present their findings at the annual meeting of the @entity124 's @entity123 on november 25 .			0

scientists from the *universities* of @entity41 and @entity76 believe vertical motion is critical to explaining why the @entity1 still exists
the @entity71 was expected to dissipate rapidly but its storm is still raging hundreds of years on
the research could help to explain oceanic vortices on @entity105 , which can last for years , as well as those that contribute to star and planet formation
