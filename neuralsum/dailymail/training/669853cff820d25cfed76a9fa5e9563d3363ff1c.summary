as she stepped on stage at the finals of the @entity4 pageant last weekend , few would have guessed that winner @entity5 , 21 , lacked confidence			1
but miss @entity5 , who describes herself as ' painfully shy ' , says she not only had to overcome a lack of confidence , she also had to deal with the legacy of being bullied at school			1
according to the glamorous 21 - year - old , from @entity13 in @entity14 , cruel school bullies taunted her about her shyness and left her feeling less confident than ever			2
then 15 , the shy youngster was persuaded to enter the @entity30 beauty pageant - and was amazed when she came second			2
miss @entity5 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , says that was enough to turn the tables on her tormentors and begin the journey to her miss @entity4 crown			1
' i was painfully shy when i was younger and used to get bullied until one day i decided that i was n't going to put up with it any more and decided to prove the bullies wrong , ' she explains			2
'' i never used to stand up for myself but now i would not allow it any more because i 'm a lot stronger			0
' the 21 - year - old was spotted when out one day with her mother and says modelling and competing in pageants has help rebuild her confidence @entity5 , here competing in miss @entity4 as miss @entity46 before she won , has not always been so self confident the model originally wanted to become a @entity51 diver and joined her local team on the same day as future @entity54 hero @entity53			1
as a child she suffered a collapsed lung and needed emergency surgery , before turning to diving in a bid to boost her recovery			0
miss @entity5 , who now lives in @entity61 , also modelled part time for fashion student friends and squeezed in assignments at weekends			2
eventually , she decided to move to @entity61 to pursue modelling full - time but even then , her mother @entity66 , 50 , says she was still inexplicably shy			0
' it was to do with her confidence again because she 's quite a perfectionist and never thought she was good enough so she would stress over it , ' she explains			0
' after a bad night out when she came home upset , i said to her that everyone was always saying that she should go to @entity61 and do some modelling and why did n't she give it a go			0
@entity5 , third from right , was crowned miss @entity4 2014 at a glittering award ceremony this weekend ' so she moved to @entity61 , worked full time and started doing the modelling on weekends			1
it was really difficult at first because she was up there on her own and it 's a big place			0
' but the blonde has never looked back and has since won miss @entity4 and @entity84 , as well as completing modelling assignments for men 's magazines			1
miss @entity5 has also appeared on @entity88 , has starred in several tv ads and has been signed up with two modelling agencies			1
now dating @entity92 footballer @entity91 , a delighted @entity93 added : ' if you know what you want to do you 've just got to go chase it and even though it 's hard work and sometimes takes a long time to get there , you can do it			0
' i 've worked so hard and sometimes things have n't worked out but i do n't let it get me down , i just carry on to the next thing and keep going			0
