by @entity1 reporter published : 16:34 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 04:18 est , 24 september 2013 @entity2 ? : families are opting for holidays rather than banking their money for retirement workers are more likely to save for a holiday than for their retirement , according to a study			1
researchers found that 36 per cent of us are putting money aside for a trip away , but only 26 per cent are making provision for old age			1
and one in five admits to having no savings at all			0
the survey , conducted by lending service @entity21 , discovered that while two thirds of us consider ourselves good with money , most are not making any long - term financial plans			0
and of those who do have savings , 59 per cent keep them in accounts where the interest rate is below inflation â€“ some as low as 0.66 per cent			1
with the current rate of inflation at 2.8 per cent , these savings are effectively losing value			2
many also end up losing out when banks ' introductory bonus rates expire and leave them on worse rates - a practice the @entity41 has pledged to investigate			0
according to the survey , the top ten savings goals are : holiday ; rainy day emergency fund ; retirement ; children ; buying a property ; new car ; future repairs ; grandchildren ; down payment for a house ; and starting a family			1
the research found eight in ten of us have little or no trust in our savings provider			0
yet less than half ( 43 per cent ) actually review their savings once a year , and 51 per cent do n't know the current rate of interest on their savings accounts			1
independent financial analyst , @entity67 @entity66 said : ' @entity68 need to bulk up their savings to get them working as hard as they do , even more so when money is tight			2
' to ensure your savings are fighting fit , it 's important to know where to cut the fat when looking at savings options			0
priorities : only 26 per cent of us are putting money away for old age			1
retirement is third on our priorities list ' peer - to - peer lending offers a real alternative to banks with higher rates for savers to help your money grow			2
' if you do n't like bankers , why give them your savings ? ' when asked what brits are saving for , retirement came in third and saving for a house deposit came ninth on the list			0
while over two thirds ( 69 per cent ) of 18 to 54 year olds believe they are good with money , just 21 per cent of this group are actively saving for retirement			2
this is despite 81 per cent admitting they need to save in order to have a comfortable retirement and avoid a retirement crisis .			0

just 26 per cent of us are putting money away for old age
holidays and an emergency fund come first for most @entity68
most of those who are saving have accounts with interest rates below inflation
