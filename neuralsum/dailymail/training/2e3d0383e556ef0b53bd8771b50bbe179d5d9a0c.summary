' there 's three that are about that size , and the other three are a fraction smaller , ' he said			0

they will remain in the area to confirm it does n't come into the shallows again			0
' experts believe that there could be many explanations as to why the whales got into trouble			0
one such theory is that one of the whales was sick and went into shallow water , when it felt better it may have called for help from the rest of the pod			0
another explanation may be that the pod were chasing food and got caught in the low tide			0
