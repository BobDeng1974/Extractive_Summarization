@entity0 must have hoped that between @entity1 being sent off and @entity3 's poor defending , eyes would be off him for @entity4 - but his blatant dive at @entity6 was clear to see for everyone , including the referee			1
the @entity4 youngster now has five yellow cards for diving compared to four goals , and added to the embarrassment for @entity15 's side in their @entity17 defeat by @entity18 with his blatant simulation attempt in the 87th minute on monday night as the 10 - man home side chased the lead			1
making it into the penalty area ahead of @entity25 , the @entity22 went to ground in search of a late penalty but instead the only reaction @entity29 gave him was to dish out a yellow card			2
@entity0 breaks into the penalty area in the 87th minute of the @entity17 quarter - final at @entity6 the @entity22 midfielder was being closely tracked by @entity25 , who had earlier scored for @entity18 well clear of the defender , @entity0 bends his ankle as he begins to head for the deck in the 2 - 1 defeat @entity39 falls but referee @entity29 was having none of it and issued him with a yellow card for simulation the referee got an earful from the @entity45 faithful and @entity4 captain @entity47 but was right to caution @entity0 , who made it into the all - time @entity50 top two for simulation bookings in his first full season in @entity4 's first team			1
@entity55 's @entity54 agreed with @entity29 's decision and was impressed with his performance , saying : ' @entity29 was brave and correct again when @entity0 clearly dived in front of the @entity45 â€“ some players never learn			0
' @entity60 had already been booked for diving by @entity29 , moments before he earned a second yellow card for inexplicably grabbing the official			2
and between him and @entity0 , the home side were left even more embarrassed at @entity6 while @entity18 fans rejoiced in the stands - and that was already after two defensive errors was their final hope of a trophy extinguished			0
a bad night for @entity73 's men			0
@entity0 ( centre ) appeals to @entity29 while @entity4 's players hold their heads in disappointment at @entity6 @entity47 tries to make his opinions known as captain of @entity4 but was unsuccessful			0

@entity1 was sent off for @entity4 in their @entity17 exit
and @entity0 was also booked for simulation in the 89th minute
he has five yellow cards for diving and four goals for @entity4
@entity22 midfielder went down under pressure from @entity25
he was rightly shown the yellow card by referee @entity29
