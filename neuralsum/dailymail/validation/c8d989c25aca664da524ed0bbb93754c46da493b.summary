at first their mother put it down to coincidence : one of her twins was performing tasks with her right hand , the other using her left			2
but when @entity11 and @entity13 ’s baby teeth started falling out on opposite sides of their mouths , their mother @entity9 made a surprise discover - her girls were mirror twins			1
the rare condition , which is thought to occur in around 25 per cent of identical twins , refers to twins who are mirror images of one another			1
when they eat , @entity11 uses her cutlery the traditional way , while @entity13 ’s knife and fork are held in reverse			1
and their hair naturally parts on opposite sides of their heads – @entity13 ’s on the left , @entity11 ’s on the right			1
yesterday the 19 - year - olds , from @entity47 , who are currently competing in @entity50 talent show @entity51 , opened up about their unusual situation			1
@entity11 said : ‘ our mum noticed quite early on that we were doing things with the opposite hands			1
she would say raise the hand you use to draw and i 'd raise one and @entity13 would raise the other			1
' then mum mentioned it at one of our check - ups and that 's when they said about mirror twins			1
i do n’t think many people know what it is			0
' ‘ there were other things like i use my knife and fork the wrong way round , ’ @entity13 added , ‘ our baby teeth fell out on different sides as well , one of mine would fall out and then within a few days @entity11 lost the same tooth on the other side			1
also our partings are naturally opposite , although we sometimes wear it the same			1
’ @entity13 ( left ) and @entity11 are starring in the @entity81 show @entity51 bundles of delight : although identical , tiny tots @entity13 and @entity11 are known as mirror twins the twins , pictured @entity11 , left , and @entity13 , aged two in other respects , @entity13 and @entity11 are remarkably similar , made even more so by the fact they like dressing alike			1
they share a bedroom – and wardrobe – and they do their make - up in the same way			2
when they made it through the blind auditions round of @entity51 as singing duo @entity100 , they wore matching white dresses to perform @entity103 by @entity104			1
@entity13 said : ‘ we like dressing the same , but not always			1
it 's part of our performing act			0
what 's good is that i can ask her to try something on so i can see what it looks like			0
and we always talk about what suits “ us ” not what suits “ me ”			0
’ ‘ we started off as half a person , ’ @entity11 joked			1
the pair often finish each other ’s sentences , have never spent more than a few hours apart and claim to know what the other is thinking – ‘ if someone ’s being annoying we can share it with each other with a look , ’ @entity11 said			1
speaking about their close bond , @entity13 said : ‘ we rely on each other a lot , we ’re very protective of each other			1
at school we had a bad experience , we were teased quite a lot for being different to the other children , because we were twins			0
people would try to tell us apart by being like " oh you 're the one with the fatter face " and " you 're the one with the longer face " , so we were very shy			0
’ so much alike : the girls have different hair partings and one is left handed and the other right handed talented : the girls ' mother , @entity9 , discovered her daughters were different from an early age however they left that school for an arts - based sixth form college where they developed their singing act , performing at local community events and weddings			1
and tonight the @entity152 twins , who live with their mother @entity9 , 50 , and father @entity150 , 48 , will perform on @entity51 on @entity154			1
when they first appeared on the programme they divided opinion on @entity157 , with dozens of viewers writing mean spirited remarks about the twins			0
some likened them to the ghostly twins in horror film @entity164			0
however , last night @entity11 said their past experience of being teased at school meant they did n’t take the messages to heart			2
she said : ‘ i think sometimes it is a bit difficult for people because we are different , as twins , and sometimes people do n’t know how to take that , so there was the odd slightly mean comment , like about @entity164 , but the vast majority were lovely			0
close sisters : @entity13 ( left ) and @entity11 , pictured aged eight , are appearing on @entity154 's @entity51 ' also i think because of our past experiences we ’ve become really strong people and those sorts of comments do n’t really affect us anymore			1
' i think a lot of the time people do n’t realise what they ’re saying could be hurtful , like with the comments about @entity164 – they are twins , we are twins , it ’s a fact			0
' we would always say to people just be careful what you write online , you might mean it harmlessly but it could be taken differently			0
but even those comments we just have to laugh at them really			0
we looked up the film because we ’d never seen it before and it did n’t actually offend us			0
’ she added : ‘ we feel really , really thankful for the response on social media			0
it ’s been so lovely			0
such a high percentage of the comments have been so positive and even the slightly negative ones , they were n’t aimed at our singing at all			0
’ mirror twins , though rare are not unheard of and occur when a fertilised egg splits late			2
the girls enjoy slicing the cake - holding the knife in different hands to each other normally , eggs split around two or three days after fertilisation happens , causing identical twins			2
however , if the split does n’t occur until day seven , it can lead to mirror twins			2
later splits – at around day 12 – cause conjoined twins			0
around a quarter of identical twins are thought to be mirror twins			2
yesterday @entity223 , director of the @entity224 , said that investigating mirror twins was difficult			2
‘ it is difficult to research this because it happens in utero so you ca n’t observe it outside the body , ' she said			0
but we think it happens in about 25 per cent of monozygotic ( identical ) twins			0
it ’s usually the right hand in one , the left hand in the other , sometimes it ’s the hair wall , the crown of the head , which way round it goes			2
‘ research indicates that in identical twins it is usual for the teeth to grow in the same place in the mouth , within a day or two of each other			0
' but with mirror twins you may find that it will be on the other side of the mouth in one child , but in the same sort of pattern			2

@entity11 and @entity13 are mirror images of each other
one is right handed , the other left handed and hair partings also opposite
