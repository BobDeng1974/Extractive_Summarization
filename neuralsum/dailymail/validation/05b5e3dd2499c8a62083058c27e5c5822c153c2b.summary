with injuries piling up ahead of @entity4 ’s final @entity3 match against @entity5 , @entity0 has identified a solution to his selection problem			1
‘ we will play the under - 20s against them , ’ said the @entity4 head coach in his laconic , deadpan style			1
‘ we had eight players injured against @entity14			1
how many are doubts for the @entity5 match ? all of them			1
’ @entity19 , seen here tackling @entity14 's @entity18 , is one of five doubts for the @entity5 game such was the despondent air hanging over the @entity4 head coach as he spoke in the bowels of @entity25 on saturday evening , he could be forgiven for thinking the worst at the time			1
thankfully , a @entity28 medical bulletin issued on sunday suggested it was five players — not eight — who will require further treatment ahead of the match at @entity32			2
second row @entity19 , who had to come off for a time after being concussed in the first half , then had to be replaced following a back spasm , is the biggest doubt to face @entity5			1
@entity37 suffered a ‘ dead leg ’ with bad bruising and now faces a race against time to be ready			2
@entity42 has a leg injury he picked up in a tackle , winger @entity45 an elbow problem and flanker @entity47 a calf strain			2
the walking wounded will be excused training on monday , with an @entity28 spokesman saying the medical team will be working with them over the next few days to try to ensure they can put some work in before the final @entity3 match			2
@entity0 was downbeat after the defeat , which came with a heavy price in terms of personell others who @entity0 thought were more seriously hurt , such as @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , should be fit			1
‘ we have been unlucky with injuries , which has n’t helped us , ’ said @entity0 , who lost @entity65 in the build - up to the @entity68 encounter			1
‘ everybody has to be patient			0
we can turn the corner , come back strong and do well against @entity5			2
‘ right now , we have to take that defeat to @entity14 on the chin and keep working , analysing what went wrong , what went right and moving forward			1
‘ i thought there were some real positive aspects for us in our game at @entity25 but we have @entity5 next week and they beat @entity14 — so it will be very tough test			1
’ @entity0 continues to insist his side are ‘ heading in the right direction ’ despite a fourth @entity3 defeat and a likely wooden spoon			1
@entity4 captain @entity87 takes a heavy hit as he brings down @entity89 during the narrow defeat @entity91 : @entity14 v @entity4 match review he praised his players for battling back against @entity14 after losing a fourth - minute converted try from @entity96			1
‘ @entity14 based their strategy on starting well and they did just that , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ what i saw from our team after that pleased me			0
they did n’t panic , got themselves back into the match and i got a message down to them to say do n’t worry about it			0
‘ they also showed they could change tactics when needed , which is a great thing			0
‘ on top of that , i thought our line - out defence and our scrum , after the first one , was very good			0
‘ if i thought we were being dominated from start to finish i might worry but i do n’t think we are			0
there is more to come from this team , no question			0
’ captain @entity87 was instrumental in dragging @entity4 back in the face of @entity14 ’s early onslaught			1
he inspired those around him with his leadership qualities			0
@entity87 admitted @entity4 needed to be more intelligent with the ball , but praised his team 's spirit he gave the backs quick ball and put over two penalties and a conversion in a top - class display			2
‘ @entity14 came flying out the blocks but , once that happened , we had to deal with it			2
‘ the response i got from the guys was calm and controlled			0
‘ from then on , we played some magnificent rugby until half - time			0
in the second half , a couple of times there was a bounce of the ball that maybe went against us and the game just went away from us a little bit			0
we should know when to offload and when to hold the ball			0
‘ when we did get into their half , we put little kicks through when we should have held the ball			0
we need to learn that test - match rugby is won by small margins			0

@entity160 lost eight men during defeat to @entity14 on saturday
five of those are doubtful for @entity5 clash next weekend
@entity4 have lost all four games so far , but @entity0 calls for patience
