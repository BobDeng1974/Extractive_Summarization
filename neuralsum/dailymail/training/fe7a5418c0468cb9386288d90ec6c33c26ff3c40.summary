by @entity0 when it comes to bells , nothing 's been going right for @entity5 organisers today			1
there was confusion - even for over-excited @entity8 - this morning when @entity9 chimed at the bizarre time of 8.12am			1
and as puzzled onlookers struggled to fathom the timing , culture secretary @entity11 almost took out spectators at another event when a bell he was ringing flew off its handle			1
the farcical scenes unfolded as the capital prepared to begin the ' greatest show on earth ' tonight by welcoming in the @entity22			1
ding - dong ! scroll down to watch the video careful ! culture secretary @entity11 rings his bell a little too enthusiastically this morning , sending the entire brass body of the instrument flying into the crowds an @entity5 official looks on as the bell flies towards her			1
mr @entity11 is unaware at this moment of the potential disaster his ringing could cause yikes ! @entity35 grimaces as he realises that his bell has broken			1
luckily , nobody was injured after the accident the @entity11 was ringing his bell in his right hand on the deck of @entity40 when the brass became detached from its wooden handle and shot through the air above the deck of the @entity46 cruiser			2
he watched helplessly as the bell disappeared among a group of @entity5 fans , his face betraying the fear and horror that a bystander maybe seriously hurt			0
but fortunately the bell missed hitting anyone , with a clearly relieved mr @entity11 caught on a @entity57 camera saying : ' oh , oh dear ! are you all right ? health and safety ! are you ok ? there we are , disaster averted			0
' the @entity40 is permanently moored on the @entity64 near @entity66 's @entity65 , with mr @entity11 aboard as part of the all the @entity68 as people across the country rang bells to mark the start of the @entity73			1
health and safety ! mr @entity11 , @entity11 joins more than 300 bell ringers at the @entity40 today ... before his accident the @entity78 minister later made light of the near - miss , comparing it with a scene from the @entity82 comedy @entity83			2
he wrote on @entity84 : ' oops bell broke taking part in @entity88 's ringing in of the @entity73 ... no one hurt but classic # twentytwelve moment			1
' mr @entity11 later told the @entity82 : ' i was ringing a bell in a very excited way and it collapsed in my hand and went flying off			1
i had my very own 2012 moment			0
' the first of today 's celebration began with @entity9 chiming non stop for three minutes from 8.12am while hundreds of churches and people across the nation rang their bells to greet the official start of @entity22			1
the hour bell of the landmark @entity106 pealed 40 times over the following three minutes			2
special permission had to be gained for the hour bell at the @entity106 to be allowed to toll out of its regular sequence			0
but the actual timing of the event baffled many , as well as the @entity66 mayor , who could not understand why it was ringing at that particular minute and so far in advance			0
@entity66 mayor @entity8 was puzzled when the bells rang out at 8.12am for three minutes on the public 's growing enthusiasm about the @entity5 : ' a benign sort of virus passing from individual to individual '			1
on describing his role in the opening ceremony : ' just part of the politburo sitting there on the platform looking out rapturously '			0
on the growing excitement about the @entity73 : ' the @entity132 counter of @entity133 is quivering towards the red zone ... ' on the @entity136 : ' i think people are going to well up with hot tears of patriotic pride when they see this '			1
on the @entity82 radio 4 today programme , presenter @entity141 explained the idea , before revealing that the excitable mr @entity8 was just learning about it too			2
he said : ' it is being rung at 8.12am because it 's 12 hours until the 24 hour clock will reach 2012			1
' slightly complicated but you get the point			0
that was @entity8 on the phone , who obviously did n't know that coming on the line			2
' to which mr @entity8 said : ' yes , i was a bit mystified about that			1
' many have questioned why the bells are being rung 12 hours before the clock reaches 20:12 , and not just wait until tonight			1
@entity84 users posted their confusion about their idea , saying the timing made no sense			0
@entity166 tweeted : ' why were the bells at 8:12am ? that makes absolutely no sense with the 24 hour clock if they were going for 20:12			2
' another , called @entity173 , posted : ' would it not make more sense to ring @entity9 at 20:12 tonight ? ' the celebrations are believed to be the first time that the strike of @entity9 has been rung outside its normal schedule since february 15 1952 , when it tolled every minute for 56 strokes for the funeral of @entity183			1
the bells at the @entity186 , @entity187 in @entity188 and the @entity189 also rang so that all four @entity190 chimed in unison at 8.12am , @entity5 chiefs said			2
town crier @entity192 at @entity193 gets into the @entity22 spirit by ringing his bell ring in the @entity73 ! @entity198 communications rating @entity196 , rings @entity200 's ship bell in @entity201 as part of the national all the @entity204 event to celebrate the start of the @entity22 the cacophony of sound is for the @entity209 event , the brainchild of @entity212 - winning artist and musician @entity88 who is encouraging everyone in the @entity215 to ring a bell			1
the piece of conceptual art , which has the official title @entity220 1197 : all the bells in a country rung as quickly and as loudly as possible for three minutes , was devised as part of the @entity224			2
confusion aside , thousands threw themselves into the spirit of the event , with church bells , bicycle bells and even mast bells being rung all over the country as excitement swept the nation			1
speaking on the today programme , mr @entity8 said the games had swept aside even the most cynical of sceptics and he hoped they would ' bring the whole country together '			2
he said all expectations of the success of the @entity239 had been surpassed as excitement about the games passed from person to person like a ' benign sort of virus '			1
he said : ' it 's unbelievable to watch people who are normally sceptical types to be caught up with the @entity239 spirit			2
' the red - faced blunder for @entity251 at @entity252 was the latest of several slip - ups by organisers before the @entity136			0
on wednesday , video producers sparked a diplomatic row by mistakenly displaying a @entity258 flag during the warm - up of @entity261 's women 's football match at @entity262			0
the incident saw @entity261 's players walk off the pitch in protest , before the glitch was fixed an hour later			0
it is thought a video producer in @entity66 - who has since offered to resign - was at fault for the gaffe			0
and just yesterday , @entity239 programme producers referred to @entity275 footballer @entity274 as being @entity276			0
organisers had anticipated about 1.5million people coming out to see the @entity239 , but figures suggested it was closer to 3.9 million			0
and the mayor , who won re-election ahead of the @entity73 in may , said the palpable public enthusiasm for the @entity5 was a huge opportunity for @entity66			2
' it is our chance to show the world what we are all about , our chance to throw a great party			0
' there are very , very important economic reasons for trying to get the best out of the @entity73 ... i want to see great economic benefits from these games			1
' we have so many things going for us and the games is a chance ... for us to show those things off and that is not unimportant			0
' mr @entity8 said he would be watching as much sport as he could during meetings and events he attends in his capacity as @entity66 mayor			2
and he said tonight 's @entity136 would be a brilliant set - piece to launch the 16 days of competition			0
he said : ' it 's a long time since i saw @entity311 's rushes and i ca n't reveal , for those who do n't know what 's going to happen , the details			0
' it was an absolutely brilliant piece of theatrical organisation			0
i think people are going to well up with hot tears of patriotic pride when they see this			0
' as part of the celebrations , the bell on board the royal @entity321 also pealed for three minutes as it processed down the @entity64 , carrying the @entity239 flame and a ceremonial cauldron			0
@entity40 fired its canons in a countdown to 8.12am as 300 children , sea cadets , brownies and @entity333 gather on board to ring an assortment of bells			1
others taking part include the @entity198 and the @entity339 , the @entity340 , the @entity341 , the @entity342 , the @entity343 , the @entity344 and @entity345 of @entity333 , the @entity346 and the @entity347			0
@entity348 , one of six @entity5 host boroughs , rang in the changes as one of its councillors joins a @entity355 of @entity356 for a ding - dong at the historic @entity358			0
the traditional @entity360 welcome with councillor @entity361 was witnessed by the @entity362 , who is new at the church			0
the @entity365 , carrying the @entity239 flame , moves off from a barge containing giant @entity239 rings , and right , the boat passes by @entity9 the @entity355 's row barge ' @entity365 ' carries the @entity239 flame along the river @entity64 from @entity372 to @entity373 today , the last stage of its journey to the @entity376 the full three - minute chime was broadcast on @entity378 , @entity379 and every @entity82 local radio station across the @entity215 , with a potential live audience of more than 10 million people			1
bells rang everywhere from @entity215 ’s northernmost inhabited house in @entity385 in the @entity386 , to the @entity215 ’s most westerly church in @entity388 in the @entity389			0
it aims to set a world record for the largest number of bells to be rung simultaneously and can include any from children with handbells , through people ringing bicycle bells and doorbells , to experienced change ringing experts of tower bells and church bells			1
