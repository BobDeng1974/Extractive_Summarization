three decades after it started gaining attention in @entity3 curry houses , the great @entity0 has been put forward for official recognition			1
if the @entity6 grants the dish @entity8 status , it would mean anyone in the world cooking the distinctive curry must refer to it as the @entity0			1
it would then join @entity14 , @entity16 parmesan cheese and @entity17 , which already have the legal protection			1
the @entity0 has been put forward for @entity20 status , three years after it started growing in popularity in @entity3 curry houses the @entity0 was developed by cooks from northern @entity23 when they came to @entity3 in the 1970s and 1980s			1
altering ancestral recipes to incorporate @entity3 ingredients and the @entity3 palate , they came up with a dish cooked in a steel pan over a high flame			2
using meat cooked off the bone , the cooks started using vegetable oil instead of the ghee they had used in @entity23			0

‘ let ’s hope the popular @entity0 recipe follows in the footsteps of our other iconic foods like the @entity69 pasty and @entity71 celery			2
it would be a wonderful boost for this great city ’s world famous @entity74			0
‘ legally protecting food names creates new jobs and attracts more tourists to the area			0
we hope other producers are encouraged to do the same and unlock the full potential that their original recipes can bring			0
’ @entity85 , adviser to the @entity86 said : ‘ we look forward to the day when it joins the hallowed ranks of @entity89 and @entity90 as a protected food			1
