@entity0 has warned @entity1 she will trigger a second @entity3 independence referendum if he tries to take @entity4 to the @entity6 exit door			1
the steely first minister , in her first interview with the @entity8 on the day of her election manifesto launch , said for the first time that she would regard an ' out ' vote in the @entity14 ' proposed poll on @entity6 membership as justification to reopen the question of breaking up the @entity4			1
she also revealed that she intends to be in @entity18 on may 8 - the day after the general election - to personally lead the @entity21 's negotiating team in the event of another hung @entity24			2
' if there are negotiations to be had i 'll be there , ' she said			0
in a wide - ranging interview , the first minister , riding high on polls suggesting the @entity21 is on the brink of a landslide unprecedented in modern @entity4 politics : miss @entity0 also revealed that she - not her predecessor @entity30 - would take charge of any talks , even though she is not running for a @entity34 seat and he is the @entity3 first minister addressed supporters at an @entity21 rally at a indoor mountain climbing centre in @entity50 miss @entity0 's manifesto included proposals to seek to thwart the @entity14 ' planned in / out @entity6 referendum by 2017 , the first time voters would have had a say on our place in @entity58 for 40 years			1
she said @entity21 mps would seek to amend an @entity6 referendum @entity61 to insist on a ' double majority ' - meaning that unless @entity63 , @entity3 , @entity64 and @entity65 each vote to leave the @entity6 , the @entity4 would remain a member state			1
the first minister , who has previously said merely that ' something substantial ' would have to change before the @entity21 held a second independence referendum , said a @entity14 government seeking to take @entity3 out of the @entity6 against its will would be a trigger			1
the @entity74 lost last year 's independence referendum by 55 per cent to 45 per cent , having previously suggested it was a ' once in a generation ' event			0
@entity1 speaks to supporters during a @entity80 rally in @entity81 , @entity82 miss @entity0 told the @entity8 that an @entity6 exit would be ' something substantive ... change in circumstances ' that would mean a second @entity3 independence referendum was necessary			1
' it 's if there was a vote that ended up taking @entity3 out against our will			2
that 's the only concrete example , ' she said			0
' i 'm quite clear : a vote for the @entity21 at this election , i 'm not taking that as a mandate for another referendum			2
so it would have to be something like the @entity6 situation			0
' it 's if there was an out vote across the @entity4 and @entity3 wants to stay in			1
i suspect if we were in those circumstances there would be a clamour of people across @entity3 to look again at the independence question , whether i 'm proposing it or not			0
' but what i 'm talking about with a change of circumstances , it 's not me trying to pluck out the conditions out of thin air			0
i do mean it - there will have to be a change in circumstances and we have n't even started the process of the 2016 manifesto [ for @entity24 elections ] yet			0
' if i put a commitment to a referendum in any future @entity21 manifesto , people have to vote for that manifesto so i ca n't do that lightly			2
i have to be sure that there is a change of circumstances that has led to people by majority opinion wanting another referendum			0
' miss @entity0 , who received a rock star welcome from party faithful as she launched her blueprint for power near @entity50 yesterday , was scathing about @entity142 's economic plans			1
' @entity142 like to talk the langauge of anti austerity but the substance of the proposals is not anti austerity , ' she said			0
' this is not all about conversations between me and @entity150			0
i know for a fact there are plenty of folk in the @entity142 ranks that agree with me on austerity more than they agree with @entity150			2
' there will be support			0
one of @entity150 's shadow ministers has said he would never vote for the renwal of @entity161			2
yes , people focus on talks between the leaders but what i 'm saying is that we 'll try to forge alliances across the @entity168			0
the prime minister today warned that @entity170 would hold the @entity4 to ' ransom ' if the @entity21 holds the balance of power in may the @entity21 have vowed never to strike a deal to keep @entity1 in @entity174 - whatever the result of the election ' we will prevail on some things , we wo n't prevail on others			1
we would like to build those alliances with people of like mind across different parties			0
' the first minister said she had been ' surprised ' by messages of support from people in @entity63 and @entity64 who said they wished they could vote @entity21			1
' after the first leaders ' debate it pleasantly surprised me			0
as a proportion of everyone in @entity63 it was a tiny proportion but it was a lot - i still get a lot of emails saying " we wish we could vote @entity21 "			1
there are people in @entity63 saying " i wish @entity142 was saying these things			2
i wish we had a progressive alternative			0
" ' that 's why i do think @entity1 is making a mistake trying to base so much of his campaign on the assumption that people are afraid of the @entity21			2
this is borne out in the polls			0
there is not a clear enough big enough decision and divide between the two main parties			0
' @entity150 insisted he would not be held to ransom by the @entity21 asked about voters ' fears in the rest of the @entity4 at the prospect of a separatist party wielding power , which led to the @entity8 dubbing her ' @entity220 in @entity4 ' , she joked : ' i thought it was possibly one of the nicest things the @entity8 had ever said about me			1
' brandishing a picture in her manifesto of her hugging a small child on the campaign trail , she asked : ' do i look like one of the most dangerous women in @entity4 ? come on ! i do n't think that 's how people in @entity63 see the @entity21			1
' that 's not to say they agree with us on independence - many do , but many do n't - but i do n't think many people in @entity63 see the @entity21 as this big bogeyman threat			1
' if there are some people that do , i take my responsibility seriously to persuade them that they are wrong and i do accept that i have a big responsibility in how i conduct the campaign and how i speak to people both in and outside @entity3 to persuade people that there 's not anything to be scared of from having the @entity21 in big numbers both inside and outside @entity3			1
' she insisted that she - not mr @entity30 or the @entity21 's @entity34 leader @entity251 - would lead hung @entity24 negotiations if , as polls predict , the party takes as many as 50 seats and holds the balance of power at @entity34			1
' i 'll be there , ' she said			0
' i 'm the leader of the @entity21 , i 'll be in charge of any decisions and negoaitions and anything that happens after may 7			0
' miss @entity0 denied that a hung parliament , led by a minority @entity142 government propped up vote - by - vote by the @entity21 , would be a recipe for chaos which would further undermine voters ' trust in @entity24			1
' my experience of being in a minority government - and it 's a very direct experience of being deputy leader in a minority government for four years ... it can , contrary to what you are saying about reducing trust in politics , can have the opposite effect because the public see politicians having to win arguments rather than votes by sheer force of numbers			1
the experience of minority government in @entity3 was stable - clearly , because it lasted for four years			1
' so based on that experience i have a different view of what a minority government situation and i do n't think it has to be unstable or ineffective			2
' miss @entity0 said the coalition 's fixed term parliaments legislation would strengthen the @entity21 's hand			1
it means general elections are held on a fixed timetable every five years , and makes it much harder for an election to happen at other times			0
two - thirds of mps now have to back an earlier election , and governments can lose votes on budgets , @entity307 's speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election			1
' the @entity312 does make it possible to change a government 's position without threatening the existence of that government ... including a budget , though i must say i 'm not going into this trying to block a budget			2
that 's not the mindset we are taking into this			0
' but the @entity312 , in a @entity325 context , has made the prospect of a minority government a much more viable one			2
' miss @entity0 said she had been surprised to be told that the prime minister was not prepared to sit alongside her at the end of their separate interviews on sunday 's @entity332 , as guests traditionally do			1
' i would have been quite happy to sit next to him , ' she said .			0

@entity21 leader said the @entity4 could not pull out of @entity6 without @entity3 's say so
ms @entity0 said an ' out ' vote would justify a new independence poll
@entity1 has *pledged* to hold an in - out @entity6 referendum by 2017
*laughed* off her title as " @entity220 in @entity4 " in a recent @entity8 front page , asking : ' do i look dangerous ? '
said many @entity142 voters in @entity63 and @entity64 - and significant numbers of its @entity353 - *preferred* her *vision* to that of @entity150
claimed @entity1 *refused* to sit next to her on @entity332 's sofa when they both appeared on his @entity361 tv show at the *weekend*
said new rules on fixed term parliaments meant the @entity353 could seek to block key pieces of legislation , including budgets , without bringing down a minority government
insisted governments dependent on smaller parties for support would increase trust in politics because leaders would have to ' win the argument ' not rely on mps as lobby *fodder*
