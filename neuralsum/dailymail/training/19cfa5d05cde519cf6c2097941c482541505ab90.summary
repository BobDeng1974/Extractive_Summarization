however , there are signs that a wet @entity71 is in store these scenes are a world away from the wind and rain of last week , and the blustery weather to come tomorrow blustery : fierce winds are said to be on their way , because of the position of the @entity82 deserted : @entity5 's beaches were packed last bank holiday monday , but the weather has since taken a turn for the worse @entity18 forecaster @entity87 said : ' unsettled weather ahead is due to the jet stream being further south than normal , allowing low pressure systems to track across the @entity5 rather than further north			1
