by @entity0 plans are being drawn up for a new high - speed orbital railway connecting @entity5 's zone three suburbs in a bid to keep the capital 's soaring population moving over the next few decades			1
@entity5 mayor @entity9 revealed the scheme in his @entity12 plan and predicted the capital would see a population shift to the east with @entity16 possibly becoming the next @entity17 within 100 years time			1
he said about £ 200bn of spending on transport infrastructure alone would be needed in the capital by 2050 to keep suburbs like @entity16 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 up to speed and connected with the heart of the city			1
but where @entity46 largely connects zone two , the orbital railway will link suburbs in zones three and four including @entity54 and @entity16 - and even @entity55 in zone five			1
as @entity5 's population grows over the next few decades , demand for rail transport is expected to increase by 80 per cent			1
mr @entity9 was in the east @entity5 borough to launch his plan , which he described as ‘ a real wake - up call to the stark needs that face @entity5 over the next half century ’			1
he said : ‘ without a long - term plan for investment and the political will to implement it , this city will falter			0
@entity68 need to know they will get the homes , water , energy , schools , transport , digital connectivity and better quality of life that they expect			2
’ the @entity46 mainly covers @entity5 areas in zone two but the new orbital railway would extend from zone three right through to the outskirts encompassing some zone five areas like @entity55 @entity9 's plans for a new metro - style train link in @entity5 are based on the success of the @entity46 ( pictured ) which has brought prosperity to the suburbs @entity16 was historically a fishing settlement on the @entity90 in the county of @entity92			1
but when the railway arrived in 1854 the 5,000 strong population was given access to other forms of work in the centre of @entity5			1
and when the tube arrived in 1908 , the population swelled to around 37,000 , taking advantage of the suburb 's transport links			2
@entity16 is nine miles from central @entity5 with a current population of 187,000 , the majority of which are within the @entity108 estate the major has earmarked the area for further regeneration and the former industrial lands to the south are being redeveloped as @entity114 , with plans to build more than 10,000 homes			1
office suites , shops and restaurants will also be built in a bid to bring more jobs to the area			0
but planning permission has been granted for only a fraction of that until the new rail links arrive			2
it is hoped the new orbital railway will bring prosperity to areas in the east that have been earmarked for new homes			2
@entity114 , a piece of former industrial land sandwiched between the @entity134 and the @entity135 , has been marked for almost 11,000 new homes but planning permission has been granted for only a fraction of that until new rail links arrive			0
mr @entity9 toured the new area after launching his new plans for the capital ’s infrastructure			2
he said : ‘ this will be @entity17 here in 100 years ' time			0
‘ transport infrastructure makes all the difference to the prospects of a community			0
’ and he reckons 50,000 new homes will need to be built in the capital to meet the needs of @entity68			0
he said : ‘ population growth is unstoppable			0
you 've got to go with the grain of how people want to live their lives			0
' if they want to live in the greatest city in the world , there 's no point in trying to fight them off with a pitchfork			0
’ but he ruled out building on the green belt , explaining that green infrastructure is just as important as the city ’s other utilities and called for an extra 9000 hectares to be provided .			0
