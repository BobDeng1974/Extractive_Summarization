he added : ' the answer to that , according to you , was that @entity2 is dead			2
' the witness replied : ' but was i not telling the truth , i was covering up for my parents			2
' questioned about why ms @entity2 suggested to police that @entity2 may have been with a male friend , the barrister said : ' the wicked and cruellest thing you could do in those circumstances , knowing someone is dead , is to lay suspicion on a wholly innocent individual			1
' ms @entity2 responded : ' i did n’t put suspicion on someone else and i think it is wicked and cruel you are saying it yourself			1
' family home : the @entity83 lived in this house in @entity29 , @entity4 last week , @entity13 described how her parents pushed @entity2 onto the settee in their house and she heard her mother say ' just finish it here ' as they forced a plastic bag into the teenager ’s mouth and suffocated her in front of their other children			1

he said she was expecting the jury to believe what she was telling them about her parents , but that ' time and time again ' she had been telling lies			2

i have been very kind to them			0
' on trial : @entity43 , left , and @entity2 , right , are said to have killed their 17 - year - old daughter because she refused to obey them ' i have been fair in everything i have said , ' ms @entity2 said , adding she told the police that the murder was not about @entity2 being forced into an arranged marriage			1

tragic : @entity2 had been a keen student at her school in @entity29 , @entity4 , and enjoyed trips to shopping centres and wearing @entity151 clothes the jury was told how she paid £ 1,500 for a @entity154 bag as well as ' renting ' a grey @entity156 for £ 400 a week			2
