you missed it ! for the love of ¿ ! ¿ the @entity10 has made a humiliating u-turn after breaking its own editorial guidelines in the marketing of a satnav system voiced by @entity15 host @entity3			1
bosses at @entity17 , the @entity19 ’s commercial arm , were so keen to rush out the gadget in time for @entity21 that they forgot to check their own rules , which dictate that the programme must not promote or endorse any motoring products			1
@entity25 had signed a deal with the @entity10 and satnav specialist @entity27 to stock the product , which costs £ 180			1
some 54,000 are already on the shelves , but once the existing devices have sold out , no more will be produced			1
@entity17 will now donate the proceeds to @entity33			1
in true @entity3 style , the sat nav features the presenter barking : ‘ turn right			2
you missed it ! for the love of … ! ’ he told @entity41 : ‘ it is mostly about the tone of voice i use			2
‘ there ’s a tone of voice i use when ordering people to do things , so , “ i said left , left , i said left ” , you know , that kind of thing			2
‘ it ’s not a gentle sat nav voice , put it like that			2
’ putting the brakes on : @entity27 had already produced 54,000 sat navs featuring @entity3 's voice before the deal had to be scrapped actor @entity60 is one of the latest celebrities to lend his voice to sat navs following a @entity64 campaign			1
@entity27 will also let you download @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity69 characters @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			2
comedian @entity73 has recorded directions in his trademark rambling style , and gravel - voiced @entity77 admitted he was considering following suit , before concluding : ‘ i always end up at one place — on @entity81			0
’ according to the @entity10 ’s conflict of interest rules , presenters ‘ must take particular care not to endorse any product or service which could be covered in the programmes on which they work '			0
@entity3 , who was not involved in setting up the deal , will not receive any money from the sales			0
a @entity17 spokesman confirmed the u-turn , and said additional charitable donations would be made by @entity27			0
he added : ' launch plans were too advanced to prevent the physical product going on sale in retail outlets ' , by the time the problem was identified			1
a source said the costs in terms of compensation to @entity27 incurred by @entity17 had been ' negligible '			0
it is understood the electronics firm will talk to @entity17 about further voice deals			0
@entity25 has exclusive rights to sell the product which was launched last week			0
a spokesman said : ' we are disappointed with the decision by the @entity10 on behalf of our customers who told us they loved the product			0
it was proving hugely popular			0
' while we have plenty of stock at the moment we will not be able to replace them when they are gone , so the strident tones of voice of mr @entity3 will be appearing in @entity25 for a limited time only and after that he will be silenced , at least on a sat nav			1
' the @entity124 edition had a @entity126 mode , which rendered the device instantly silent , @entity3 's direction and selected points of interest including race tracks and locations relating to the series .			0

ruling too late as 54,000 @entity135 go on sale in time for @entity21
