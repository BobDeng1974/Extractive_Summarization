by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:15 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 20:52 est , 18 march 2013 chancellor @entity2 is under pressure to act to cut the cost of living , as new figures show the economic downturn left middle income households £ 3,000 - a - year worse off the disposable income of an average family is twice what it was in the late 1970s , official figures showed yesterday			1
but the report reveals that the rise is not down to significant tax cuts , as the taxman ’s share of middle - class incomes has hardly changed over the past 35 years			2
the disposable income after taxes and benefits of a middle - earning and working age household is currently £ 29,900 , according to the analysis from the @entity23			2
this is a fall from a peak of £ 31,100 in 2007 , before the recession eroded the earnings of middle @entity28			1
but back in 1977 , the era of union barons and near national bankruptcy , the average disposable income was half this level when calculated at today ’s prices – £ 15,500			2
the proportion the @entity36 takes from the average income in tax has hardly changed			0
instead the state has continued to demand virtually the same share of middle incomes – around a third			2
this means that , in real cash terms , governments have taken increasing amounts from families			0
the @entity23 report says that , at current prices , the taxman was grabbing a little over £ 8,000 a year from an average income family in 1977 , but £ 14,464 out of their income in 2007 , and £ 12,654 now			1
it comes as chancellor @entity2 faces growing calls to act to tackle the rising cost of living in wednesday 's budget			1
he is expected to scrap planned rises in fuel duty , offer more help to homebuyers and tax breaks to help working families with the cost of childcare			2
there will also be the promise of a flat rate £ 155 - a - week pension and a cap of £ 73,000 on the costs of social care which an individual will have to find before the state will help			0
the statistics watchdog examined the effects of the downturn on the crucial ‘ middle fifth ’ of the income distribution range to see how the middle classes were hit			0
average incomes for all families rose steadily since the 1970s , until the financial crash in 2007 before tax and cash benefits are taken into account , the average income for non-retired households in the middle fifth stood at £ 36,400 in 2007 - 08 but by 2010 - 11 it had fallen by 8.8 per cent to £ 33,200			1
the @entity23 said : ‘ this was largely due to income from wages and salaries falling for this group since the start of the economic downturn			0
‘ however , the effect of falling earnings was partly offset by an increase in the average amount these households received in cash benefits and a fall in the proportion of gross income paid in direct taxes			2
’ after tax , disposable incomes also fell during the double dip recession but not as steeply			0
between 2007 - 08 and 2010 - 11 , after adjusting for inflation , the average disposable income the ‘ middle fifth ’ fell by 3.8 per cent , from £ 31,100 a year to £ 29,900			1
should this budget be @entity2 's last chance to turn around @entity28 's economy ? however , researchers found that over the longer - term , @entity28 are still much better off than in the 1970s when , allowing for inflation , the average middle income household had a disposable income of £ 15,500 in 1977			1
for all households from the richest to the poorest , the median disposable income in 2010 - 11 was £ 22,590 , wiping out rises since 2005 - 06			1
incomes have also been hit by the coalition 's decision to increase vat from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent in 2010			2
but at 2010 - 11 prices , disposable incomes are still much higher than the £ 10,708 enjoyed by a family in 1977			1
the revelation that ' squeezed middle ' families were left £ 3,200 - a - year worse off by the recession coincides with a survey by consumer watchdog which ? suggested families have curbed their spending by more than £ 3,000 a year since the economic downturn			1
as @entity138 feel the squeeze they are scaling back on buying non-essential items in an attempt to save money , according to consumer watchdog which ?			0
this frugal attitude has created a £ 136billion hole in the economy , which is already limping under the strain of austerity measures			0
the research found that even despite the 2007 financial crash , the middle classes had seen their incomes double in real terms since the 1970s , when economic turmoil and industrial strife saw rubbish piled up in the streets , including in an official rubbish dump in @entity160 's @entity159 in 1977 , the middle fifth of non-retired households paid 16.3 per cent of their gross income in indirect taxes			1
by 2010/11 , this had fallen to 15 per cent , the @entity23 said the @entity23 said there was a close link between average family incomes and the state of the wider economy			0
incomes rose during periods of economic growth and fell after the recessions of the early 1980s , early 1990s and late 2000s			0
for 30 years form 1977 , the proportion of income paid in direct taxes remained relatively stable at around 21 to 23 per cent			0
but since the downturn , the level has fallen to 19.2 per cent , largely as a result of the relative decrease in the amount of income tax paid			0
@entity186 general secretary @entity185 said : ' these figures show the real cost of the @entity28 ’s living standards crisis for middle @entity28 , with households thousands of pounds poorer today than five years ago			1
' but rather than helping families , the government ’s real - terms cut in welfare support next month will make them ever poorer			0
' the chancellor can start putting right this damage in his budget on wednesday by cutting @entity125 , which will save households hundreds of pounds a year			1
@entity186 research shows this is the most effective way to help low and middle - income households			2
' cutting vat and reversing welfare cuts , rather than reducing corporation tax or raising the personal allowance again , would show that the chancellor is prioritising the living standards of middle @entity28 over big business and rich households			1
' the figures show non-retired households have seen sharper rises and bigger falls in their incomes increases in the personal tax allowance has contributed to a reduction in the amount the middle fifth now pay in tax , which for direct taxes ( income tax , council tax ) stood at 19.2 per cent of gross income in 2010/11 , compared to 23.5 per cent in 1977			1
indirect taxes , such as vat and fuel duty , have also fallen from 16.3 per cent to 15 per cent , reflecting the reduction in consumer spending during the financial crisis , but has started to rise again since the vat rate rose to 20 per cent in january 2011			0
but the figures do show the toll that the credit crunch has taken on households that were previously financially comfortable			0
the average disposable income of those in the middle who have not yet retired stood at £ 29,900 in 2010/11 , but this has fallen by around 3.8 per cent from the £ 31,000 it was before the financial crisis hit			0
the number of non-retired households relying more on the state has also increased , with cash benefits in the middle fifth increasing by 26 per cent since the downturn began - thanks in the main to more retired people receiving the state pension .			1

from 2007 to 2011 , the ' middle fifth ' of households saw incomes fall by £ 3,200 - a - year
but gross incomes for middle fifth of non-retired households has *soared* from £ *20,300* in 1977 to £ *37,000* in 2010 - 11
