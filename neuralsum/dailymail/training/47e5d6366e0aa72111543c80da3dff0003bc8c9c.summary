on the eve of a fundraising breakfast being attended by the president at the home of @entity15 ceo @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity0 went over things she could discuss with @entity7 while at the event in october 2013			1
' should i ask him if he liked @entity22 ? ' @entity16 asks @entity0 , a reference to the 2012 @entity25 film @entity26 that dealt with the subject of slavery in the @entity29			1
the pair then keep going , listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name , including @entity54 and two @entity56 movies , @entity57			1
' i bet he likes @entity56 , ' says @entity0 at one point			2
this all come just one day after @entity0 called @entity62 ' a minimally talented spoiled brat ' in emails discussing who would direct her upcoming remake of the classic film flop @entity68			1
@entity16 and @entity3 have refused to comment on the leaked emails , though @entity0 did give a statement to the @entity71			1
' this is not about salacious emails being batted around by @entity75 and @entity76 , ' the disgraced producer said on wednesday			2
' it ’s about a criminal act , and the people behind it should be treated as nothing more nor less than criminals			2
' @entity84 comments : @entity16 asks @entity0 if she should talk with president @entity7 about the 2012 slavery film @entity26 ( above ) racist response : @entity0 suggests that @entity16 maybe talk with the president about 12 years a slave ( above ) not good : the email exchange also finds @entity0 commenting that president @entity7 ' likes @entity56 ' in other leaked emails , these having to do with @entity0 's upcoming @entity93 biopic @entity93 , screenwriter @entity91 has some not so kind words for the man now set to star in the film , @entity98			1
' i do n't know who @entity98 is and the rest of the world is n't going to care , ' @entity91 tells @entity16 when informed of the studio 's desire to cast the actor , who also starred in 12 years a slave			1
cyber attackers breached @entity3 's computer network on november 24			0
@entity110 has denied any involvement in the attack , despite their anger over @entity3 's planned movie ' @entity114 '			0
hackers released online several upcoming @entity3 movies including the family hit @entity118			2
the personal details of thousands of employees were also released			0
hackers also revealed the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity			0
dozens of highly embarrassing emails were released - including one which described @entity62 as a ' minimally talented spoiled brat '			1
another email claimed ' nobody ' knows the identity of @entity1 star @entity98 , though one man does praise the size of his genitalia			2
one man who is clearly a fan of @entity98 however is producer @entity137 , who says of the @entity139 actor in one email , ' he just makes you feel bad to have normal - sized genitalia			1
' on a more innocuous note , another email exchange released on tuesday involving @entity145 president @entity144 revealed that @entity148 star @entity147 was trying to get a discount on an $ 8,000 @entity3 television shortly after his show @entity148 was originally cancelled by the studio after five seasons on the air			1
according to a report on @entity157 the emails formed part of the november 24 cyber attack on @entity3			0
as for the fundraising event , which took place last november , president @entity7 did indeed talk about the film industry , saying : ' believe it or not , entertainment is part of our @entity50 diplomacy			2
' if they ’re watching an old movie — @entity171 , the @entity172 , or @entity173 and @entity174 — they ’ve had a front - row seat to our march towards progress			0
even if their own nations have n’t made that progress yet			0
' according to public records , @entity16 donated $ 5,000 to president @entity7 's re-election campaign and gave a further $ 30,800 to the @entity183			1
@entity7 made no mention of the films @entity26 , 12 years a slave , @entity54 , @entity187 in his speech at the event			1
@entity190 , pictured , described @entity56 as a ' whore ' after the star wanted more money actor @entity56 , was branded ' a whore ' by a senior @entity195 after the star asked for more money to promote a new movie			0
. the email exchange between @entity3 studio executive @entity190 and @entity3 co-chair @entity2 and @entity201 chief executive officer @entity200 , was leaked following a major cyber attack on the company			1
according to @entity75 : ' i 'm not saying he 's a whore , but he 's a whore			0
' the email continued : ' it 's not as if we paid him @entity209 and @entity210 respectively for his last 2 films thinking he might be nominated			2
we paid for his ability to open a film which included his social media savvy			0
' i feel like this is something that should be negotiated going into the film as opposed to after the fact			0
it feels tantamount to buying a car and then upon picking it up being told that the engine will cost extra			0
i 'm tempted to suggest we call his bluff			0
' if he does n't do his normal routine , his film will not open as well and his brand will appear diminished and he will - in fact - be f * * * * * * himself because we have his next 2 immediate films			0
and then there 's the social media precedent we 're setting ... especially in light of the fact that @entity237 is at the same agency			0
