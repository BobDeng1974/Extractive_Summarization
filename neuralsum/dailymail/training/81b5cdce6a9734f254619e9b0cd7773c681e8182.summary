day one : @entity5 sign @entity3 , one of the world ’s most potent centre - forwards , in a deal worth so many millions nobody seems quite sure exactly how many , but everyone agrees he will play up front			1
day two : @entity12 and @entity5 defender @entity13 pipes up in an online blog to brand him “ awful ” , criticise the size of his salary and demand he is dropped , while @entity17 reject and @entity19 defender @entity18 calls him “ chubby ” in an interview on @entity22 tv			1
day three : @entity23 his first game as the official captain of the team with a dour and low - key friendly against @entity19 in front of the smallest crowd ever to witness an @entity12 international at the new @entity31			1
he punched the air with the sort of ferocity he might have reserved for @entity13 or @entity18 and that was that			2
off he went , hopeful that here was a goal to end the idea that the captain ’s armband has carried with it a mild curse since @entity56 passed on the responsibility			2
there was @entity60 ’s miscued header in @entity61 , @entity63 ’s knee injury in @entity64 and @entity65 ’s … well , there was @entity65			1
if week two starts in the same way for @entity33 in @entity69 , @entity12 will be in real trouble			1
@entity32 can not contemplate defeat in @entity72 on monday			2
not because it will ruin their chances of qualification			2
there ’s no way @entity12 can fail to reach the finals in @entity81 in 2016 , but this team is in desperate need of signs of encouragement to be sure they are to rebuild with any confidence after the @entity88 debacle and the new skipper is to achieve the place in history he craves			2
predecessor : @entity94 with @entity60 after handing him the captain 's armband in 2004 unlucky : the captain ’s armband has carried with it a curse since @entity56 passed on the responsibility off the field , @entity33 had performed his captaincy duties well			1
he stood at the front of the line , sang the anthem , swapped the mini-flags without trouble and witnessed the coin tossing ceremony			0
he had been relaxed and good humoured as he joined @entity32 for a press conference on the eve of the game , wise - cracking about the manager ’s physical condition			2
@entity33 resisted the urge to respond to @entity18 ’s remarks like @entity117 once did , with a four - letter message to the people of @entity19			1
@entity18 , a @entity17 reject , who signed for the @entity17 and returned across the @entity121 without appearing for a single second , would no doubt have his comeuppance on the pitch			0
on the field , it all seemed a little more arduous			0
this remember is @entity33 ’s natural habitat			1
he is a playground player			0
all the pomp and ceremony is not his cup of tea , but let him loose with a ball and watch him go			0
early on , he misplaced passes and his touch was heavy , while his partnership with @entity138 has still to click			0
some strikers seem to have a telepathic connection			0
although that is not necessarily @entity33 ’s fault			1
leading from the front : @entity33 emerges from the dressing room with his team - mates ahead of kick off frustration : @entity12 were held for much of the game and struggled to break through @entity150 's defence the chemistry between them best summed up when @entity138 , looking to take a free - kick quickly having been fouled in the centre of the pitch , thought he had seen a @entity33 run and clipped a pass over the @entity19 defence			1
the trouble was there was no run			0
it was more of the maddening frustration witnessed in the @entity88			0
@entity33 ’s best work came when he dropped deeper , turning on the ball in midfield and launching long passes			1
he appreciates the angles of the game when tucks into those areas			0
he tried to make things happen in a game which threatened to seize up at times			0
he remains a good player , but he is less often these days one who can inspire			0
@entity12 had the best of the early chances but it was @entity178 , dashing inside from the left who lifted the supporters from their slumber			2
backwards step : @entity33 ’s best work came when he dropped deeper towards midfield in @entity69 , @entity12 could find themselves over-run if they go there with two zippy wingers and two strikers			1
@entity33 ’s role is the one which will have to be refined			1
there was a goal , there was a win but there was no end to the concern			0
it 's not too late to play @entity198 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity33 new @entity12 captain after @entity60 *retirement*
striker *netted* 68th minute spot - kick to give @entity207 the lead
@entity5 frontman still has to prove captaincy *credentials*
@entity33 ’s best work came when he dropped deeper towards midfield
