by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 04:15 est , 31 may 2013 if you saw yesterday 's @entity4 story about the horned hats and live goldfish handbags on display at the @entity9 's graduate fashion show and thought the latest styles could n't get any more bizarre , think again			1
the graduates at @entity13 's @entity12 trumped their peers with their latest catwalk collections			1
some of the most unusual styles came from menswear designer @entity17 who accessorised her models with gold mouthpieces that hung from their mouths exposing their teeth			1
suffering for their art : the models showcasing @entity17 's collection wore painful - looking gold mouthpieces the fashion statement is a no - no for anyone self - conscious about their gnashers or anyone with a fear of the dentist - given it looks like a painful implement that you might expect to endure when sat in the chair for treatment			1
when it came to their clothing , some of @entity17 's male models wore diamante skull caps , while for footwear they all wore trainers			1
the young designer hinted that she wants to make double denim ( or even triple denim ) an acceptable trend with one of her styles involving a man wearing a denim skirt over denim trousers with a shirt of the same fabric			2
layered look : @entity17 's menswear range was heavy on denim , left , and multiple garments worn at once remember me : branded tops ensure everyone knows the name of the graduate designer behind the gold accessories another of her models took layering to a new extreme wearing multiple garments topped off with a large white quilted jacket			2
not to be out done on the catwalk , another of the student fashion designers had some eye - catching styles on display in her collection			1
@entity81 designer @entity80 had an array of spiky headwear on show that looked like it had been inspired by nature			2
some of her pieces were reminiscent of a hedgehog while another looked like a furry caterpillar wrapped around a model 's head			2
inspired by nature ? one of @entity94 's hats is reminiscent of a furry caterpillar sticking out : meanwhile this hat is certainly eye - catching bewildering : can the model see where she 's going in this unusual creation ? the designer said her aim is to ' create an experience of wonder and bewilderment for the adorned ' futuristic : her prickly designs also extend to clothing @entity80 writes on her website that her aim is to ' create an experience of wonder and bewilderment for the adorned			0
' and her hats seem to do the trick as it appears the wearer can not see where they are going thanks to some of spiky styles covering their whole face			0
and one might wonder who would actually wear them			0
the designer carried the spiky theme into her clothing range and this did seem more wearable with one style covering the shoulders like a futuristic fur stole			0
monochrome overload : @entity131 's menwears range focused on geometric black and white designs @entity134 - style platforms complete the unusual look another menswear collection that made a statement was @entity131 's monochrome range			0
he mixed black and white stripes and checks in over-sized coats and leggings with platform shoes the @entity134 would have been proud of in their heyday			0
meanwhile , @entity146 's womenwear collection stood out thanks to her use of bright colours , quirky hats and feathered textures creating a range that looked wearable as well as unique			0
the catwalk show for the press and trade featured 33 collections by students specialising in menswear , womenswear , knitwear and millinery			1
the day is an opportunity for the students to show off their imaginative flair and in the competitive world of fashion , it 's no surprise they often go for outlandish designs to try and capture of the attention of industry bigwigs			1
colourful : @entity146 's womenswear collection was bright and striking			0
