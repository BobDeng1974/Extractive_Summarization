after swimming for five hours and climbed over rocks at the shoreline in the pitch black to reach help for his family who was still out at sea			1
off the coast , his sister tried to keep her family alive as they clung to their boat that had capsized			1
@entity19 , 43 , of @entity20 was fishing off the coast of @entity22 , @entity23 when her brother , @entity2 , her 70 - year old father , 9 - year - old niece and 3 - year - old son , were caught up in a thunder storm			1
their boat was only 16 feet long and @entity2 and her brother immediately knew they were in trouble			1
hero : 46 - year - old @entity33 , of @entity34 , swam five hours against strong waves in the middle of a storm for help ' it was sundown			1
the water suddenly became very choppy and a wave crashed into the boat , filling the boat with water , ' ms @entity19 told @entity46			1
' @entity2 started to bucket the water out and i grabbed life jackets and made sure everybody had one , but then there was another wave			1
in a second our boat was upside down in the water , ' ms. @entity19 said			1
when their boat capsized , @entity2 ' brother and father swam under to get lifejackets			1
' my father wears a pacemaker , and we had very young children with us , so we made sure everybody stayed near the boat , ' said ms. @entity19			1
rescued : @entity63 , 9 , was among those saved from a capsized boat ' i had my son between me and the siding			1
@entity2 did the same thing for my niece , ' @entity2 continued			2
' the children took turns sitting on the boat			1
' the family clung to the boat for an hour and a half in cold water infested by jellyfish and sea nettles			1
@entity19 said the boat capsized about two miles from shore , and drifted about five miles in a parallel direction when the tide turned			1
@entity33 ' father , whose name also is @entity33 , is a 70 - year - old retired commercial waterman from @entity34 , @entity23 , who organized the fishing trip			1

man on a mission : @entity33 swam for five and a half hours to shore to raise the alarm and get help ' there was only a little bit of light left , and the storm was still in the distance			1
we could see the lightening hit the water and we knew there would not be another boat that late in the evening , ' @entity2 explained			1
' it was so cold			0
my son was shivering and shivering and shivering against me			0
he kept repeating ' i do n't like this , ' ' i do n't like this , ' ' this is no fun ' , ' she remembered			0
@entity2 knew that nobody was going to start looking for them until the next day , so she and @entity2 decided they had to act			0
' our family was n't expecting us back until tomorrow , and we did n't think we 'd be able to make it that long , ' @entity2 said			2
' @entity2 and i looked at each other and he said , ' should i try it ? ' i knew he was talking about swimming to shore			0
so i told him to try it			0
but we had no idea if he would make it to shore , ' she added			0
the sun had set by the time @entity135 's brother left his father , niece , nephew , and sister on the capsized boat			2
he swam for almost five hours , reaching shore around 1 a.m. near tragedy : the boat overturned two miles from short			2
after calling 911 , @entity33 went on a rescue boat with volunteer firefighters to find his family in the pitch black ' @entity2 made it to the beach but he was so tired , he could not walk			1
so he crawled to the nearest house he saw			0
luckily they had dogs , which woke the family up			2
and even luckier for us , that family had the personal number for the fire chief , ' @entity2 said			2
meanwhile , ms. @entity19 and her family had been clinging to their rocking boat for almost eight hours			1
' it was absolutely horrible , ' @entity2 recalled			0
' our legs were getting stung over and over again by the jellyfish			0
we had cuts and bruises			0
waves kept crashing over our heads			0
' @entity2 started to worry about her father			0
' he had been in the water the longest			2
and i realized that if anything happened to him , i 'd have to choose between helping him and leaving the kids and staying with the kids			0
it was such a hard choice to make peace with			0
' but ms. @entity19 found ways to keep everybody 's spirits up			1
' i kept saying , ' they 're coming for us , we 're going to get rescued , do n't worry , '' she said			0
' we talked about stupid things like eating ice cream and watching movies			0
' back on dry land : on the boat were @entity2 ¿ 70 - year - old father , a 9 - year - old niece , @entity192 sister , @entity19 , and her 3 - year - old son it was as they were talking that she noticed lights in the horizon			1
' suddenly we could see the boats and a helicopter and we just started screaming and waving			0
' ' there were a few storms in the area , and the boat turned upside down , ' said sgt. @entity205 at the @entity206			2
' mr. @entity2 swam to shore			0
these people are very lucky			0
' a @entity211 helicopter hovered above the 16 - foot @entity212 as firefighters from @entity22 , @entity214 and @entity215 in @entity216 and @entity217 in @entity218 pulled alongside			2
the @entity219 also was on the scene , mr @entity205 said			1
volunteer firefighters pulled @entity2 and her family onto a boat but it was only until they were taken to a second boat that she was reunited with her brother			1
' it was the most amazing feeling			0
i ran up to @entity2 and said you are my hero			0
' the family is safely back on shore , with no significant injuries			2
perhaps someone would have located the fishing party , eventually , even if @entity2 had not swam for help			1
what is certain is that wearing life jackets saved their lives , mr @entity205 said			0
' it is lucky they put life jackets on , ' he said			0
' the life jackets are what saved their lives			0
' ms. @entity19 ' 9 - year - old niece , @entity244 , called her uncle a ' real hero			1
' ' everybody is fine			0
but really , there were some very beautiful moments in the water			2
we were terrified , but the sky had never been clearer and we could see all the stars in the @entity254			0
there was no light pollution , ' ms @entity19 said			1
' the water was glowing blue with the fluorescent jelly fish			2
' ' i 'm so grateful to the first responders that came and helped us out			2
i was so happy to see them and i love all of them			0
and i am so proud of my family , especially my brother			2
' friends and family are taking care of the survivors			2
' everybody has just been great , ' ms @entity19 said			1
' my friends have been cooking for us , ' she said , ' they said i should n't have to worry about dinner after all of this			0
and i think they 're right			0
