@entity2 's @entity1 ceiling , @entity4 ’s @entity3 ... now we have @entity8 ’s @entity7 mural			1
the 79 - year - old nun has followed in the footsteps of the masters by completing a stunning 26ft by 18ft art work depicting monks rebuilding the abbey in @entity16			1
over three years , and in between bouts of hip surgery , mother @entity8 worked tirelessly , painting for six hours a day , every day – apart from sundays , of course			1
mother @entity8 's beautiful mural at the @entity7 in @entity16 - which she worked on six days a week the artwork , commissioned for the building 's millennium , depicts monks working to rebuild the @entity7 another scene in @entity8 's mural - showing monks loading blocks onto a horse - drawn cart the result is a spectacular arch - shaped mural made up of 20 wooden panels			1
mother @entity8 , who trained as a mural painter at the @entity35 in the 1950s before becoming a nun , was commissioned to create the piece as part of the celebrations for the abbey ’s millennium in 2018			1
although she is based at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , the monks at @entity7 found out about her talents through the @entity48 order which encompasses both communities			2
mother @entity8 , 79 , trained at the @entity35 in the 1950s in mural painting an outside view of the @entity7 in @entity16 - which will celebrate its millennium in 2018 this is a stupendous work : accomplished , confident , beautifully planned and executed			1
it fits with distinction into the great tradition of mural painting that has been a feature of @entity59 art over the last 100 years in the hands of @entity61 and @entity62			2
there are great precedents , such as @entity65 , the @entity66 master who painted devotional images on the walls of the cells of fellow monks			0
working within a great tradition , the artist cleverly adopts from the modern movement just what she required			0
and so this remarkable mural is just what such a work ought to be : truly timeless			2
by @entity78 , editor of the @entity59 @entity79 in 2011 she took possession of the panels , which she laid out on the floor of the village hall in @entity44 – the only space available for a project so ambitious			0
mother @entity8 painted the work in acrylic , often using a palette knife instead of a brush			1
as she progressed , she was forced to pause for three operations and turned to friend sister @entity91 , 83 , herself an artist and a former art teacher , for help with practical tasks , such as mixing paint			0
together they made the deadline at the end of last year			0
yesterday mother @entity8 said : ‘ it has pushed me to the limit both physically and mentally but there has been a lot of enjoyment in it as well			2
it really has got to be the project of my life			0
’ the mural , in @entity112 ’s 360 - seat @entity111 restaurant , is due to be unveiled next month			0
@entity115 @entity114 , who commissioned the work , said : ‘ it is a monumental effort			0
