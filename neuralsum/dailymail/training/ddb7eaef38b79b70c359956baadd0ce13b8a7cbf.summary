a doctor who quarantined herself for three weeks after treating dozens of ebola patients in @entity1 has vowed to return to disease ravaged @entity4 to help more victims			1
dr @entity6 , from @entity7 , has today spoken of her ordeal for the first time , revealing of the 100 patients she helped , just three survived			1
the 32 - year - old spent a fortnight in @entity4 with relief organisation @entity13 , treating victims of the epidemic			1
during that time she watched as two colleagues , @entity19 dr @entity18 and aid worker @entity20 fell ill with the deadly virus , helping nurse them before they were flown home for treatment			1
the 32 - year - old is back at work at @entity34 in @entity35 after health officials gave her the all - clear dr @entity6 , pictured in her protective clothing , right , worked for the organisation @entity13 in the @entity4 capital of @entity42 , at the same treatment clinic as @entity19 victims of the deadly virus dr @entity18 and @entity20 after returning to her home in @entity7 , dr @entity6 said she decided to confine herself to her flat for three weeks , fearing she could have contracted the disease			1
following advice from @entity49 , she only kept in touch with friends and family via @entity53 , even becoming a virtual guest at a wedding			0
but the 32 - year - old has now been given the all - clear and has rejoined colleagues at the @entity35 - based @entity34			1
she said : ' before i went out there it was apparent to me that there was an epidemic that was spiralling out of control			0
' when i got out there with @entity13 i felt like we were sitting on a timebomb waiting to explode			2
' and it was very apparent that there were increasing numbers of ebola cases and there were not enough staff to look after them and they were struggling to get on top of everything			2
' it was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of my life			2
' at her treatment centre in the capital , @entity42 , there was a 90 per cent mortality rate among the roughly 100 patients she dealt with			1
' it was very challenging to manage so many patients and see so few survive , ' she said			0
' @entity89 is a horrible disease and the way it causes people to die is unpleasant			0
' and the trauma to the families is terrible - knowing that their loves ones had ebola and the likelihood they would n't survive was very difficult to manage as well			2
' dr @entity6 took over the day - to - day running of the centre when dr @entity18 , 33 , and 59 - year - old ms @entity20 were isolated after developing the potentially fatal condition			1
both were flown back to the @entity19 for treatment and have since been cured , with dr @entity18 describing his return to health as ' miraculous '			1
when the 32 - year - old returned home to @entity7 she voluntarily put herself in quarantine , not leaving her flat for 21 days , only contacting her family and friends via @entity53 dr @entity6 , said : ' when i got out there with @entity13 i felt like we were sitting on a timebomb waiting to explode			1
it was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of my life ' dr @entity6 said : ' when we heard @entity18 and @entity20 had contracted ebola it was a scary time			1
' but i did n't have a lot of time to worry about it as we were so busy			0
' @entity123 had isolated himself as soon as he had a fever and i helped to look after him - along with the rest of the team - before he was flown back to the @entity19 ' as well as a friend and a colleague he was the medical director of our unit and after he left i took over the day - to - day running of the unit			2
' it was extremely stressful so i did n't have a lot of time to think about it			0
' it was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of my life ' - dr @entity6 ' the most worrying thing was how he and @entity20 had become infected			1
we all had personal protective equipment and very tight protocols which had not been broken			0
' dr @entity6 said while beds were in short supply the unit had plenty of iv drips , antibiotics , anti-malaria drugs , painkillers and other medical equipment			2
but without a specific treatment for @entity89 she knew most of her patients would die			0
of the roughly 100 patients she helped cared for , just three survived			1
' it 's hard for a doctor to know that they wo n't be able to save the vast majority of their patients but i already knew that when i went to @entity4 , ' she said			2
' i knew many local health care workers were frightened of their patients and the care they gave them was inconsistent			0
' there can be nothing worse than to die alone in pain and frightened so i went there to help prevent some of this suffering - to care for them , to manage their pain , to pray with them and to comfort them			0
' she said one of the most memorable days she spent in @entity4 was when a boy of 12 , called @entity177 , recovered and was able to be reunited with his family			2
mrs @entity20 and dr @entity18 were flown back to the @entity19 in specially designed isolation pods and treated using the experimental ebola drug , @entity182			1
both have since made a full recovery she added : ' we were so delighted when he got better and we were feeding him lots of biscuits			0
it was a great day in a very hard period of time			0
' two of her other patients also survived ebola but dr @entity6 was back in @entity49 when she was told they had been given the all - clear			1
dr @entity6 , who wants to specialise in paediatric infectious diseases , said she would not hesitate to go back to @entity4			1
she added : ' there is so much work to be done and if i could get leave i would definitely go out there and help again			0
' they need healthcare staff to not only care for patients but help to contain the spread of infection			0
' @entity89 is a severe viral illness often characterised by the sudden onset of fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat			0
in its early stages its symptoms can often be confused with a cold or flu			0
with @entity89 , however , other symptoms emerge which include vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding .			0

dr @entity6 confined herself to her @entity7 flat for three weeks after arriving home from a two - week stint treating ebola victims in @entity4
32 - year - old has since been given the all - clear and is back at work
she worked at the same @entity13 clinic in @entity42 as @entity19 victims dr @entity18 and @entity20
when dr @entity18 fell ill she took over the running of the centre
of the roughly 100 patients she saw , only three survived
she said : ' it was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life '
but dr @entity6 has vowed to return to help more victims of the disease
