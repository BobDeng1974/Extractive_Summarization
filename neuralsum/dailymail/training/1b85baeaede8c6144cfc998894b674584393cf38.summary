by @entity1 reporter published : 23:55 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 07:26 est , 17 october 2013 @entity3 mayor @entity2 has been elected as the new senator for @entity5 after winning a special election wednesday night			1
the win now gives the rising @entity9 star a bigger political stage after beating conservative @entity11 , a former small - town mayor			0
with nearly all precincts reporting , @entity2 had 55 per cent of the vote to @entity11 's 44 per cent			2
' in a speech later to supporters in @entity3 , @entity2 spoke , as he often does , of the unity of the @entity29 people			1
' that 's why i 'm going to @entity16 - to take back that sense of pride			0
not to play shallow politics that 's used to attack and divide but to engage in the kind of hard , humble service that reaches out to others , ' he said			0
@entity2 also told of how his father , who died last week at 76 , taught him about love and hard work , values he says he 'll carry to the @entity40			1
@entity2 , 44 , will become the first black senator from @entity5 and heads to @entity16 with an unusual political resume			1
he was raised in suburban @entity44 as the son of two of the first black @entity48 executives , and graduated from @entity49 and law school at @entity51 with a stint in between as a @entity53 before moving to one of @entity3 's toughest neighborhoods with the intent of doing good			2
big win : @entity2 , seen here with his mother @entity59 , mentioned his father in his acceptance speech following his death last week moving on up : @entity2 is seen as a rising star in the @entity9 party and this win will propel him to a more national stage after raising his profile within @entity5 after working as the mayor of @entity3 he 's been an unconventional politician , a vegetarian with a @entity21 following of 1.4 million - or five times the population of the city he governs			1
with dwindling state funding , he has used private fundraising , including a $ 100million pledge from @entity76 founder @entity75 , to run programs in @entity3 , a strategy that has brought his city resources and him both fame and criticism			1
@entity2 was elected to complete the 15 months remaining on the term of @entity83 , whose death in june at age 89 gave rise to an unusual and abbreviated campaign			1
if he wants to keep the seat for a full six - year term - and all indications are that he does - @entity2 will be on the ballot again in november 2014			1
wide margin : he got 55 per cent of the vote compared to his competitor 's 44 per cent governor @entity95 , a @entity96 with a national following of his own , appointed his attorney general , @entity98 , to the @entity40 temporarily and scheduled a special election for a wednesday just 20 days before @entity95 himself is on the ballot seeking re-election			1
@entity95 said he wanted to give voters a say as soon as legally possible			0
@entity9 challenged the timing , saying @entity95 was afraid of appearing on the same ballot as the popular @entity2 but the courts upheld the governor 's election schedule			1
@entity2 had a running start on the election			2
before @entity83 died , @entity2 passed up a chance to run against @entity95 this year , saying he was eyeing @entity83 's seat in 2014 , in part so he could complete a full term as mayor - something he wo n't do now that he 's heading to @entity16			1
he won an august primary against an experienced @entity9 field including two members of @entity119 and the speaker of the @entity121 in a campaign that was largely about ideas			0
the general election was about deeper contrasts , both ideological and personal			0
@entity11 stepped down as @entity5 director of the anti-tax , pro-business @entity127 to run			0
@entity11 , who is legally blind , got national attention as mayor of the town of @entity132 when he tried to get @entity133 made its official language			0
after two runs in @entity96 gubernatorial primaries and as the leader of successful campaigns against ballot measures to raise a state sales tax and fund stem - cell research , @entity11 was a favorite of @entity5 's relatively small right wing			0
gathered with supporters wednesday evening in @entity145 , he said , ' unfortunately for whatever reason the message we delivered together ... did not win the day			0
' @entity9 influencers : state senator @entity150 ( left ) is running against current governor @entity95 in his bid to get re-elected @entity11 , who has twice sought his party 's nomination for governor , told @entity154 he has no plans to challenge @entity2 again next year or seek any elected office again			1
@entity2 does not expect to be sworn in until close to the end of the month , an aide said , noting the results still need to be certified by the state			2
when he steps down as mayor of @entity5 's largest city , the council will be able to appoint an interim mayor			0
the two candidates had portrayed each other as too extreme for the job			0
throughout the campaign , @entity11 was aggressive , criticizing @entity2 during a string of homicides in @entity3 , holding a red carpet event in rally to mock the time @entity2 spent fundraising in @entity173 and declaring that ' @entity5 needs a leader , not a tweeter			1
' @entity11 also criticized @entity2 when a @entity176 , @entity178 stripper revealed a series of not - so - salacious @entity21 messages she 'd exchanged with @entity2 , who 's single			2
looking nationally : @entity95 , seen here at a debate against @entity150 , is also a popular @entity5 politician who has publicly expressed higher aspirations and is seen as a possible presidential candidate in 2016 the topic resurfaced last week when @entity11 fired a key adviser after a profane interview in which the adviser suggested @entity2 's words were ' like what a gay guy would say to a stripper			2
' @entity11 had called it ' strange ' that @entity2 wo n't say whether he 's gay			2
@entity2 , for his part , has said his sexuality should not matter to voters and has been elusive on the subject			2
at a debate this month , @entity11 responded to @entity2 's comments about the need for environmental regulations to clean a river through @entity3			1
' you may not be able to swim in that river , ' he said			0
' but it 's probably , i think , because of all the bodies floating around of shooting victims in your city			0
' @entity2 seemed stunned at the remark , and his campaign has criticized @entity11 for it .			0

the popular mayor of @entity3 is now a member of the @entity40
a special election was held to replace the spot left open after senator @entity83 died
if he wants to serve for a full term , @entity2 will have to run again in november 2014
