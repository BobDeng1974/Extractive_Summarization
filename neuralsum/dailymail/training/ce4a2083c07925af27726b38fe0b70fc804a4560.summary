@entity0 had barely digested his first breakfast under the new world order when he waded into an online debate with those who thought @entity5 should simply try to copy the way @entity7 produce footballers			1
those people are either ‘ oblivious to the obstacle ’ or they ‘ believe in magic wands ’ , rapped @entity0 on @entity12			1
‘ you might as well say @entity5 needs weather like @entity15			0
’ he claimed @entity7 ’s ‘ holistic approach ’ could not be transported across the @entity17 and added : ‘ we are going to have to find our way of doing it because the system we have does n’t allow us to adopt the @entity24 route in its entirety			1
it is not simply the bitter football rivalry but the painful proof that @entity5 are being left behind as others accelerate and are losing the ability to convert our raw materials into footballers of genuine world - class ability			1
at the heart of @entity7 ’s victory in @entity45 is the fact that six of those selected by @entity49 for the final before @entity52 ’s injury in the warm - up – had started in the final of the @entity55 in 2009 , when the @entity24 had beaten @entity5 4 - 0 in @entity56			1
success stories : @entity58 ( left ) and @entity59 ( centre ) played for @entity5 in the @entity55 in 2009 from the @entity5 team that day , only @entity58 made it to @entity45 , although @entity59 is another who would have played for the @entity64 five years ago had he not been banned and @entity65 would have been at the @entity28 but for injury			1
but it goes a little deeper			0
all but one of those who started for @entity7 in @entity56 went on to play senior international football , including some who switched flags			2
@entity72 played for the @entity73 at the @entity28 and @entity74 played for @entity75 in the qualifiers			0
@entity77 , who missed the final against @entity5 through suspension , was in @entity45 with @entity80			1
switching sides : @entity77 played for @entity7 's youth sides before declaring for @entity80 rising star : @entity84 is on the brink of a move to @entity87 then there was @entity84 , the poster boy for the @entity89 in 2009 ; a prolific young striker from @entity90 who was injured and unable to take part in the tournament			2
@entity7 got by without him , and @entity84 developed into a midfielder , now on the brink of a move to @entity87			0
it was indeed an exceptional crop but , still , it goes deeper			0
@entity7 made the decision to deliberately restructure its youth development programme at the start of this century and these are the results coming to fruition			1
' other young players are coming , ' warned @entity101 , president of the @entity102 ( @entity102 )			0
eyes on the prize : @entity24 chief @entity105 is hoping for a years of domination it ’s true , in the same year that @entity7 ’s @entity110 were winning in @entity56 , their @entity107 were winning the @entity112 title with a team featuring a certain @entity114 , scorer of the only goal in the @entity28 final			1
this could be an era of domination , as @entity49 said , born out of a disappointing display ( by their own standards ) in @entity123 , when they lost to @entity125 ’s @entity5 and the old foes were out together , after the group stage			0
@entity5 crossed their fingers and hoped players like @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 would continue to progress at their clubs , while @entity7 went home and overhauled their @entity138 system to make sure the next generation was much better			2
rock bottom : @entity7 started from scratch after their @entity123 exit the advantage they had was that the @entity102 and the @entity146 were almost one entity at the time and the governing body had power to force change upon its clubs			2
strict regulations were imposed in youth development from 2001			1
he did n’t spell it out but this is probably @entity0 ’s ' obstacle '			2
the relationship between the power brokers inside the @entity160 game is complicated by the rich history and the community roots of a 92 - club pyramid			1
one of its biggest strengths has been its biggest weakness when it comes to international football			0
dejected : @entity170 and @entity132 reflect on @entity5 's @entity28 exit as @entity7 sorted itself out , the @entity102 did next to nothing and things conspired against them			0
they took an age to build @entity175 and neglected coach education while clubs routinely denied young players release to play for their country at @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity89 level and , in some cases , the players were happy to be denied it			0
at the same time , clubs made it harder for these young players to get into the first team by signing more foreign players and the development process stalled			1
the argument is well - worn and still everyone points fingers of blame at each other			0
the @entity102 does one thing , the @entity198 another and the world hurtles towards another season and the qualifying campaign for @entity203			0
@entity204 for @entity5 - @entity130 ' i ’m confident the mountain is starting to move , but it ’s a slow shift and results will take time , ' said @entity0 , who perhaps understands ( or represents ) the confused forces as well as anyone in his dual role as @entity5 coach and @entity215 analyst			1
as he tweeted away about @entity7 and @entity5 , @entity215 were confirming the matches being shunted around for live broadcast and issuing a press release in which @entity0 was quoted saying : ' i ca n’t wait for the new season and i ca n’t wait for @entity215 ’s live matches			2
i ca n’t wait to get back into the studio			0
' really ? others ca n’t wait for a major tournament when it ’s not quite so embarrassing to be @entity160 , but , failing that , sure , bring on the @entity198			2
it will be great entertainment as ever and we can all do with the distraction .			0

three @entity230 coach says @entity160 club system restricts youth development
@entity0 says progress is being made but will take time for results
@entity24 hoping to dominate world football for years after @entity45 triumph
