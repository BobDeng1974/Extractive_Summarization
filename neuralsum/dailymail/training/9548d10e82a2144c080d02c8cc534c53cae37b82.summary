@entity0 and @entity1 are not the only royals with news of a new arrival - keepers of @entity6 's only breeding colony of king penguins are celebrating the appearance of the first chick to be hatched there in five years			1
the wrinkly , grey chick may not look like much , but staff at @entity13 are heralding its arrival as a breakthrough in breeding at the park in @entity17 , @entity18			1
it is the first of three king penguin eggs to hatch this year			0
the park had previously not welcomed new king penguin chicks into the world since 2009			2
they feed it using a bottle full of fish that has been liquidised in a blender to replicate the food it would be given by its parents in the wild			1
and despite being native to freezing @entity46 climes , the vulnerable chick has not yet developed feathers so it is kept in an incubator to keep it warm while it grows			0
cuddly companion : keepers have placed a toy penguin in the chick 's box so that it becomes used to other birds staff have even put a toy penguin in its box so it can get used to the look of other penguins			1
@entity63 , the park 's manager , said : ' the birth of our new arrival is quite something			2
' we are part of a @entity71 breeding programme for king penguins and have the @entity6 's only breeding colony , but our penguins had n't laid fertile eggs for five years up until now			1
' this year they laid six eggs , three of which were fertile			0
' one egg has already hatched and the penguin chick is doing very well indeed			0
growing up fast : staff at the park measure the little king penguin who they say is ' getting stronger by the day ' ' so far everything has been going to plan - we have to hand - rear the chick and have been feeding it a diet of liquidised fish with a few fish fillets			1
' it is getting stronger by the day			0
' it is very hard to tell the sex of a penguin before it reaches maturity			0
once it gets to about eight weeks old we will take a small sample of its feathers and run some dna tests to find out if it is male or female			2
boy or girl ? @entity107 will have to be taken and tested in order to tell the bird 's sex - only then will it get a name ugly duckling : the baby bird has yet to grow its distinctive feathers that help to protect it in its native @entity46 @entity117 size : the king penguins are the second largest species of penguin and can grow as tall as three feet ' there have been plenty of suggestions for names but we will have to hold off giving it a name until that point			1
' king penguins - @entity131 in @entity132 - are the second largest species of penguin , growing as tall as three feet and weighing up to 2.5 stones			1
they are distinguishable by their orange - tinted breasts , cheeks and beaks			0
in the wild they live off small fish and squid and are native to the islands of northern @entity46			2
@entity145 is famously home to sir @entity147 , a king penguin which in 1972 was appointed colonel - in - chief of the @entity150 .			0

@entity152 hatches at the only breeding colony of king penguins in @entity6
park keepers at @entity13 in @entity18 will have to rear it by hand
new arrival to be fed liquidised fish from bottle to *mimic* its diet in the wild
@entity167 not given a name as staff do n't yet know whether it 's male or female
