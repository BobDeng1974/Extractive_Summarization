the pursuit of perfection runs in families and is determined by your genes , claim scientists			1
a study suggests that rather than becoming perfectionists , people are born to it			1
runs in the family : @entity15 has said she is a perfectionist , just like her actress mother @entity17 researchers at @entity19 made the link by studying the twin registry and comparing the personalities of identical and non-identical female twins aged 12 to 22			1
identical twins have the same genetic make - up so if a personality trait is determined by nurture alone , they should be just as likely as non-identical twins to share it			1
however , one study in the @entity31 journal , found identical twins had much closer scores on measures of perfectionism and anxiety than non-identical twins			1
this indicated that perfectionism is determined more by nature than nurture and can be attributed to a person ’s parents			1
@entity15 is one famous actress who has confessed to being a perfectionist			2
she said : ‘ one of my most negative qualities is the perfectionism that i have			1
i think that i unconsciously project that because it comes from self - doubt and insecurity and that ’s the ironic part			1
‘ i ’m so deeply flawed			2
i ’m just a normal mother with the same struggles as any other mother who ’s trying to do everything at once and trying to be a wife and maintain a relationship			2
’ her parents @entity57 , a television and film producer , and @entity17 , an actress , are also likely to have been perfectionists judging by their success			1
@entity62 : actress @entity63 does not do things by half @entity63 , a successful actress who also did well academically , admitted she was a ‘ perfectionist ’ - a trait no doubt shared by her successful lawyer parents			1
she said : ‘ i ’m not a worrier , but i ’m a perfectionist			2
the thing is feeling like i did n’t do the best job i could have			0
‘ i will always be able to find something wrong , something i can do better			0
my parents say i ’m always looking ahead , thinking about what ’s in front of me			0
’ @entity77 , a judge on @entity78 and a bestselling writer of more than 70 cookery books , said that her daughter had inherited her perfectionism			2
‘ i strive for excellence in the @entity78 without any doubt , ’ she said			0
‘ i think i used to be even more of a perfectionist			0
but if i ’m laying a table , even for supper , i want it to look special			0
‘ i feel i ’ve done my job properly if it is done well			0
if i open a kitchen drawer , i want everything to be methodical and tidy			0
’ she said her daughter @entity94 , with whom she launched a range of sauces and dressings in 1994 , had inherited her pursuit of perfection			0
@entity100 , winner of two @entity102 cycling gold medals , often describes herself as a perfectionist like her father @entity104 , a former national grass track cycling champion			0
@entity107 ’s dedication to perfection , which helped him win the @entity109 and an @entity110 , is comparable to his mother @entity111 ’s determination			0
mrs @entity113 , a former professional player and coach , still irons her son ’s shirts and once jumped on a plane to take him the correct shoes			0
no mistakes : tennis star @entity107 's mother @entity111 famously jumped on a plane to get him the correct shoes dr @entity122 , who led the study , said : ‘ we found there is a strong genetic component to perfectionism and the association between perfectionism and anxiety			1
‘ there is also a significant contribution from the unique environment of the individual outside the home			0
‘ but we did n’t find evidence that the shared home environment had much to do with perfectionism			2
’ the study showed that a lack of perfectionism - being slapdash or impulsive - also has a strong genetic component			1
a second study of 340 twins , published in the @entity145 , looked at the extent to which girls and women accepted the idea that thin bodies were more attractive			0
it found that identical twins were more alike than non-identical twins in how much they idolised the bodies of skinny celebrities - a sign that they are also more likely to be perfectionists .			1

perfectionists are born - not made - scientists claim
a link between genes and perfectionism has been found by researchers at the @entity19
