by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 is not a great lover of statistics			0
‘ i prefer the naked eye , ’ he admitted ahead of @entity5 ’s 2 - 1 defeat against @entity6			1
it will not matter a jot to @entity5 ’s head coach that @entity11 , the outstanding player on the field , had 117 touches of the ball and completed 100 passes in the @entity16			1
his team - mate @entity17 , stationed in his familiar central midfield role , had 114 touches			0
he was the second best player on the night			0
intricate : @entity20 ( left ) @entity17 were key to @entity6 's passing game off the park : @entity23 star @entity11 ( right ) made 41 more accurate passes than @entity25 the best teams in the world , @entity6 among them , are trying to tell @entity5 something and yet this country continues to ignore it at almost every level of the game			1
instead we are told that the national team ’s philosophy is to play a hybrid of traditional @entity39 guts with some glamour touches for a few key players			0
pick the bones out of @entity5 ’s 2 - 1 defeat in the @entity16 and this was yet another lesson in possession			1
@entity48 , at right back , had more touches ( 82 ) than any other @entity5 player			1
@entity25 , with 78 on the night , was miles off the standard set by the world ’s best players in midfield			1
people were crowing about @entity5 ’s 93 per cent passing success rate in @entity57 ; what they did n’t mention was that @entity25 ( 67 ) was the highest in the @entity5 team			1
@entity11 ( 108 attempted passes ) and @entity17 ( 105 ) were operating at another level			1
until this country is dragged kicking and screaming into the modern era and the possession game , @entity5 will never stand a chance of winning a major football tournament			1
it just is n’t possible			0
second fiddle : @entity25 ( right ) had a pass accuracy of 92.5 per cent , but only completed 62 passes learning curve : @entity71 ( left ) had a good game but could n't match the @entity74 's ball possession when @entity76 beat @entity5 on november 11 last year , @entity75 had 125 touches of the ball in our own backyard			1
in @entity83 ’s @entity82 tie at the @entity84 , @entity75 had 175 touches			0
it was a masterful performance			0
watch @entity76 on monday night in their opening group game and two or three players in midfield areas will have more than 100 touches each			0
@entity5 rarely get anywhere near it			2
@entity93 mastered it at @entity94 , the @entity95 two years later and again at @entity96			2
when they were beaten 5 - 1 by @entity98 in their opening group game in @entity100 , many celebrated the demise of @entity103 ’s team			0
in the past eight years @entity93 have won more trophies than @entity5 have in their entire history and there is still much to learn from them			2
those who are stuck in the dark ages will argue that it ’s all down to what you do with the ball when the players are in possession			0
true , but no - one has ever lost a football match when the ball is in circulation			2
until @entity5 learn to keep control of a game , they will never compete at the very highest level .			2
