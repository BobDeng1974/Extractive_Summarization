@entity8 was hauled before the @entity25 for misconduct in 2010 , but was given just a four - year caution and freed to continue treating patients			1
however , after the latest incident , @entity8 has now quit as a paramedic			1
@entity8 avoided a second disciplinary hearing this week , choosing instead to remove himself from the register of approved medical professionals and effectively end his own career			0
@entity45 panel chair @entity44 said a full hearing was not in the public interest , and would risk upsetting relatives of mrs @entity9			0
' the balance falls in favour of permitting the voluntary removal , particularly as there is an unequivocal admission of the allegations and it will be known that mr @entity8 will no longer be on the paramedic part of the @entity45 register and will no longer be able to practise as a paramedic ' , she said			2
ms @entity44 also noted that parts of the hearing would have been restricted to discuss @entity8 's health problems			2

parents @entity72 and @entity74 were both arrested on suspicion of murder , but when the injuries were investigated , the attention swung on to @entity8			0
ms @entity72 had noticed a small cut on her son 's head and dialled 999 for help , telling the operator @entity83 had ' gone floppy '			0
@entity8 saw the boy for just 15 minutes at their @entity70 home but missed the injury and failed to advice the couple to check on their son at regular intervals during the night			2
the disciplinary hearing in 2010 was told by @entity8 's representative , @entity93 , that he was ' a very very valuable asset to the community '			2
' this is a good paramedic sitting next to me , ' mr @entity93 claimed			0
@entity98 , for the @entity25 , had said : ' there 's overwhelming evidence that mr @entity8 had the competence to perform the task but simply chose not to do so			2
' the @entity20 paramedic was given a four - year caution to mark the ' serious ' failings , but was allowed to continue working without restrictions with the @entity107			1
he admitted a string of failings prior to the latest hearing and wrote to the panel asking to be struck off the register			0
he admitted failing to provide adequate care to ms @entity9 , including failing to perform an @entity114 , failing to enquire about her past medical history and leaving her with junior staff despite her critical condition			1
he further admitted leaving the scene before the ambulance had gone to hospital , failing to travel with the patient to hospital and failing to provide an adequate handover to the attending crew			0
