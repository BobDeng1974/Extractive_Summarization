by @entity0 and @entity1 closed : @entity3 's mother , @entity2 , took her two - year - old son to @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , which lost its @entity9 unit last month a two - year - old boy has died after his desperate family rushed him to hospital – only to discover that its @entity9 department had recently been closed down			1
the mother of @entity15 frantically tried to raise the alarm after she arrived at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , at 3am last wednesday and found the doors locked			1
after banging on the doors and then finding an emergency phone outside the unit , she managed to contact a nurse , who rang for an ambulance and immediately tried to resuscitate the boy			1
but after being ferried five miles to the @entity24 at @entity25 – the nearest casualty department – @entity3 , as he was known , was pronounced dead			1
friends said the half - hour delay caused by first going to @entity5 may have cost the boy his life			1
the tragedy also highlights concerns about the dangers of closing @entity9 units and replacing them with so - called @entity36			2
despite paramedics and doctors working to resuscitate the boy for 45 minutes , @entity3 was pronounced dead at 4am			1
last night a family friend said he thought @entity3 might have survived if the @entity9 department at @entity5 had still been open			1
a full investigation has now been launched into the death by the @entity45 trust that runs @entity46 , which lost its @entity9 last month			1
@entity47 , conservative mp for @entity48 , said the closure had left a ‘ confusing mish - mash ’ of emergency services at the site			2
calling on ministers to review dozens of planned closures across the country urgently , he said downgrades resulted in people being forced to make complicated decisions about where to go , in the most ‘ distressing ’ of circumstances			2
@entity3 ’s mother , @entity2 , 27 , decided to take him to hospital after he woke up in the night , listless and running a high temperature			1
his father @entity64 was working so the boy ’s uncle drove them			0
@entity68 said : ‘ he thought it was better to drive themselves to @entity5 rather than calling an ambulance			1
so they drove to the hospital but when they got there @entity9 was closed			0
’ the 24 - hour department shut on december 9 and was replaced with a doctor - run @entity76 , which is open from 9am to 9pm			0
it is not staffed or equipped to deal with patients in life - threatening situations			0
at night , emergency cover is provided by an on - site gp			0
patients can use an emergency phone which is situated at the entrance door			0
when @entity3 ’s mother found the phone , it was answered by a senior nurse			1
she came down to help , rang for an ambulance at 3.12am , and started resuscitation			2
the ambulance arrived at 3.20am and it got to the @entity24 at 3.37am			2
@entity3 was pronounced dead at 4am			1
mr @entity68 said : ‘ if doctors had been able to treat him at @entity5 it might have made all the difference			1
’ but he said @entity3 ’s parents , who were too distraught to speak last night , accepted what had happened was @entity98 ’s will			0
mr @entity68 described @entity3 as a ‘ very lively boy ’ with no known medical history			0
mr @entity47 , who campaigned against the @entity9 closure for years , said : ‘ my deepest sympathies go to the parents and family for the tragic and shocking loss of their son			0
‘ they went to @entity5 in good faith under the most distressing circumstances , thinking that this was the right place to go in the middle of the night			1
’ he continued : ‘ it is not fair to expect people to distinguish between urgent care and life - threatening conditions when they are at their most vulnerable , but that ’s what they are expected to do now that a&es are being downgraded across the country to @entity36			0
‘ with @entity46 ’s @entity36 only open 12 hours a days but with the promise of 24 - hour doctor cover , it is not surprising that what is available can appear to be a confusing mish - mash of emergency services			1
’ frantic : the family banged on the doors until a nurse emerged and called an ambulance to transport them he also called on ministers to review all @entity9 closure plans across the country			1
those behind the closure said the @entity9 had to shut because it could not be properly staffed around the clock , which was dangerous			0
but campaigners said the decision – which they believed was to save the @entity45 money – would put people ’s lives at risk			1
in @entity145 , @entity144 vowed to save @entity46 from an ‘ unjustified ’ top - down reorganisation , and promised a ‘ bare - knuckle fight ’ over the closure of local hospital services			2
in october 2007 he and fellow @entity151 @entity150 even joined campaigners outside the hospital in a protest			0
but in september 2011 mr @entity150 , as health secretary , approved the @entity9 closure			0
a spokesman for @entity158 and @entity159 said : ‘ we would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the family on the loss of their son			0
‘ the new @entity76 at @entity5 is open from 9am to 9pm seven days a week			2
there is an emergency phone at the entrance for patients who arrive outside these hours			0
' the trust can confirm that an ambulance was called immediately by trust staff			2
the child was attended to onsite where resuscitation was initiated			0
‘ the child was placed in the care of the @entity177 who continued to resuscitate him during the transfer to @entity181			0
’ a @entity177 spokesman said : ‘ extensive efforts were made by staff to resuscitate the boy and he was taken as a priority to @entity24			0
