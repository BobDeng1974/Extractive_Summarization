a young @entity1 activist who met with president @entity2 at the @entity3 this week is blasting the prospect of a presidential visit to the @entity7 , @entity8 , suburb as ' too little , too late ' and ' bulls * * * symbolism			1
' on a conference call with reporters last night @entity12 co-founder @entity11 said she and the other young , civil rights activists who met with @entity2 on monday did not request that he visit @entity1 because they were focused on getting him to take more substantive actions			1
her comments set of a firestorm on @entity20 , in which she participated , sending out a string of tweets ridiculing the media and anyone else she perceived as suggesting a photo op with the president would solve @entity1 's race relations problems			1
@entity33 said yesterday that she and other young civil rights leaders who met with the president did not ask him to visit the @entity8 town , calling it ' too little , too late ' @entity33 , a 29 - year - old @entity7 resident , helped found @entity12 after the death of 18 - year - old @entity1 resident @entity40			1
@entity40 , who is black , was shot and killed by local police officer @entity41 , who is white			1
after being acquitted last week of criminal charges by a grand jury , @entity41 resigned his position			0
he still faces the possibility of being charged by federal prosecutors for alleged civil rights violations			0
the grand jury 's decision to let @entity41 walk sparked protests anew in @entity1 and led to renewed focus in the @entity3 on the division between law enforcement officers in communities of color and the public			2
on monday the @entity3 announced that a task force would review a @entity60 program that provides excess equipment to police departments amid concerns over the militarization of law enforcement			1
it also disclosed a $ 263 million adjustment to its 2015 budget request to fund up to 50,000 body cameras for police officers			2
@entity2 also held @entity1 - related meetings throughout the day at the @entity3 with members of his cabinet , civil rights leaders of all ages , elected officials , academics , faith leaders and law enforcement officers			1
however , the president 's spokesman said that afternoon that @entity2 had no plans of traveling to the @entity8 town to try to soothe racial tensions while vaguely acknowledging that the president could change his mind and make the trip after all			1
the @entity3 flack would n't say why @entity2 wo n't visit @entity1 now or what it would take for him to make the journey			1
the side - step did n't seem to bother the president 's guests , as the young civil rights leaders revealed on tuesday that they did n't press the president on the issue			2
calling an @entity2 visit ' too little , too late , ' @entity33 told reporters , ' what we need him to do now is him use the power of his position , the power of the highest office of the land to enact some real change			1
' we have been on the ground making the changes that we can in our community , but these are high - level changes that we need to see , ' she said , according to the @entity111			2
' these are systemic issues and we need systemic solutions for them			0
we need the backing of our black president to say that this is a racial issue and that he stands behind us			2
' we do n't need him to come and put boots to the ground			1
he should have done that 100 days ago			1
' in this picture posted to @entity33 ' twitter , she stands outside the @entity3 on monday with other young activists , waiting to be let in for their meeting with @entity2			1
@entity33 said tuesday that she did n't press him to come to @entity1 because ' we do n't need him to come and put boots to the ground			1
he should have done that 100 days ago ' @entity33 ' comments set off a firestorm on @entity20			1
she fueled the fire by sending out a series of tweets explaining her reasoning after her remarks elicited negative reactions from some of her peers , @entity33 defended herself on twitter and slammed her detractors for buying into the narrative that an @entity2 visit is all - important			1
' the media continues to push this bulls * * * vision of @entity2 coming to @entity1 and rebuilding it with his bare hands & you fell for it , ' she told her followers			1
' so folks want to get mad at me for rejecting that bulls * * * " fairytale "			1
let me say it again : there 's nothing cute about this police state , ' she added			0
' so while you all are focused on @entity164 , you are missing out on the real			0
they want our ask to be some bulls * * * symbolism , ' she said in another tweet			1
continuing , a flabbergasted @entity33 pointed out that @entity2 is perhaps the most powerful man in the world ' and the demand you want met is for him to come shake hands ? ! for what ? ' ' we do n't need him to come to the terror zone as so many of you have			1
& he does n't need to come			2
he is well aware of what we 've experienced , ' she said			0
' an @entity2 visit to @entity1 is small potatoes			1
i 'm trying to feed my folks steak			0
stop jumping after every bone			0
' @entity33 said on @entity20 that given that @entity2 is arguably the most powerful man in the world , she 's shocked that ' the demand you want met is for him to come shake hands ? ! for what ? ' in an appearance on progressive news program @entity192 on tuesday @entity33 revealed that in her meeting with the president she made a personal appeal for federal action in the name of her young cousin			1
' i looked the president right in his eye , and said that i do this work because i want to make sure that unlike @entity205 , and unlike @entity206 and unlike @entity207 , my little cousin can make it home safely , ' she said			0
describing the meeting with @entity2 as a ' frank conversation , ' she said the president was ' very receptive and was open and willing to hear our experiences and really get that viewpoint from the other side			2
' according to advocacy website @entity216 , @entity33 and other young leaders in the meeting , which included three other @entity8 natives as well as three advocates from other states , demanded federal prosecution of police officers who ' kill or abuse people			2
' they also requested independent prosecution of police officers who commit violent acts , taking the burden off of local district attorneys with whom they may be acquainted , and the creation of community review boards that have the power to make recommendations for action against police misconduct			2
also on their list was the defunding of police departments that ' use excessive force or racially profile , the demilitarization of police and new investments in alternatives to incarceration			1
' there is no reason that our local law enforcement should have military weapons , and especially in the way in which they 've been using them , ' @entity33 told @entity192 on tuesday while advocating for the federal program to be abolished			1
' they were given those weapons in order to fight terrorism , but they are the ones enacting terrorism upon our communities , ' she said , and using military weapons to ' oppress @entity268 citizens			0
' the @entity3 said on monday that while it believed the program needed better oversight , a recent review , conducted in the wake of the @entity1 protests , found that it had many benefits , as well			2
furthermore , a ' majority ' of the purchases made through the program by local police were not for military - grade weapons , they were for office supplies , @entity3 press secretary @entity275 said			1
while at the @entity283 instead advocated that the federal government abolish a @entity60 program that gives excess military equipment to police @entity33 , right , also posted this selfie of the vice president and the young activists in the meeting to her @entity20 account @entity33 also threw cold water on tuesday on the @entity3 's funding request for body cameras for cops			1
' @entity297 did n't save @entity205			0
cameras did n't save @entity299			0
they did n't make sure that @entity299 saw justice , ' she argued			0
the root cause of the division in @entity1 and elsewhere , she said , ' is racism in @entity268 , the anti-black sentiment			2
' @entity40 's shooter , @entity41 , should not have been allowed to resign , she said , he should have been fired			0
instead , he 's now a ' much richer man ' than he was before because of campaigns started by supporters to pay his legal bills			0
' it is profitable to kill a black boy			0
not only is it profitable , but you get away scot - free , ' she said			0
in comments on her twitter after her visit to the @entity283 said the fact that she was invited there shows that progress is being made , however			0
' meeting the @entity325 is only an affirmation to me that we are on the right path			0
this movement is shifting the nation , we elicited a response , ' she wrote			0
still the fact that a few activists ' got to walk into a room called the @entity337 today after 115 days of active resistance			0
that 's not enough , ' she opined			0
' think about how @entity340 of us can walk into freedom by keeping it up			0
this movement is just beginning			0
this @entity268 does n't work			0
shut it down , ' she added , repeating a catch phrase of @entity1 protesters related to their @entity350 boycotts			2
' without shutting it down , we would have never been able to walk in that building today			0
a building my ancestors built , ' @entity33 stated .			2

' we do n't need him to come and put boots to the ground . he should have done that 100 days ago , ' activist @entity11 said
comments set of a firestorm on @entity20 , during which she ridiculed her peers for believing a photo op with the president would be helpful
' the media continues to push this bulls * * * vision of @entity2 coming to @entity1 and rebuilding it with his bare hands & you fell for it , ' she said
@entity33 would rather see @entity2 abolish a @entity60 program that provides excess military equipment to local police departments
