@entity1 's famed academy continues to produce young players of @entity4 quality and on saturday they gave a full debut to another 18 - year - old			1
@entity7 came on against @entity8 last monday for his top - flight bow and sufficiently impressed @entity11 manager @entity10 to be given a starting spot against @entity13 on saturday			1
unfortunately for @entity7 his full debut lasted only 32 minutes as he came off injured after a strong tackle from @entity15			1
that being said , however , there are high hopes for the attacking midfielder at @entity20 's			0
here , @entity21 tells you all you need to know about @entity1 's latest young star			2
@entity7 made his first start in the @entity4 as @entity1 faced @entity13 at the weekend but teenager @entity7 sustained an injury during his side 's 1 - 0 defeat and was forced off after 32 minutes @entity7 , pictured with @entity28 , came on for the last 20 minutes against @entity8 last week why does his name sound familiar ? @entity7 scored a brilliant goal - reminiscent of @entity32 's famous 1993 strike against @entity33 - in @entity1 's 7 - 0 @entity35 thumping of @entity36 last december			1
@entity7 , who scored twice and set up another two in the rout , chips the ball over @entity40 's head before lashing it home			2
he was an unused substitute against @entity42 and @entity43 before finally getting his chance against @entity8			2
@entity1 youngster @entity7 scored a goal reminiscent of @entity32 's against @entity33 the teenager flicked the ball over a defender 's head before curling it into the net @entity7 wheels away in celebration after scoring in his side 's 7 - 0 @entity35 win against rivals @entity36 so , what kind of player is he ? ' he is used to playing between the lines , he 's fast , he 's left , right - footed and a player with a future , ' said @entity10 after the @entity8 game , adding : ' he 's doing well , he 's a talent			1
' he is a no 10 similar in style to former @entity66 @entity65 , with an ability to find a pass and run at defenders			0
@entity7 also has an eye for goal , finishing top scorer for the @entity73 with 13 last season			2
@entity75 youngster @entity7 has similar qualities to former @entity1 star @entity65 ( below ) @entity65 , trying to get away from @entity8 's @entity77 , signed for @entity78 in the summer @entity80 superstar @entity79 , @entity78 's @entity65 and @entity82 duo @entity81 and @entity83 are just some of the names who have progressed through @entity1 's academy			1
@entity11 left back @entity87 sealed a £ 30million move to @entity8 in june after impressing at @entity20 's , while @entity89 joined @entity82 for £ 12m			2
so , will we see more of him this season ? @entity7 's performances for @entity11 ' youth teams last season saw him voted @entity96 , which was previously won by @entity97 , who has gone on to establish himself as a first - team regular			0
he was also rewarded with a three - year contract in may - a sign of the club 's faith in him			0
@entity7 is expected to miss his the @entity104 clash at @entity105 but could feature at the weekend against @entity106			0
@entity10 certainly seems to be a fan and is committed to @entity1 's policy of giving young players a chance			1
@entity111 will return from injury in the next few weeks and @entity113 some time next year , but until then - injury permitting - @entity7 should continue in the first team			1
@entity1 manager @entity10 appears to be a big fan of young @entity7 so , what type of personality is he ? @entity7 is said to be a determined , focused young man – who is n’t letting his rapid rise go to his head			1
‘ at the start of the year i was playing youth football and now i 've made my debut against @entity8 in the @entity4 , ’ @entity7 told the @entity121			1
‘ when the season started my main goal was to cement a place in the @entity128			0
i did that , then got a few sessions with the first team			0
it 's gone quite quick			0
i 'm really proud , it has n't sunk in yet			0
’ and what about @entity75 ? @entity7 was called up to train with @entity75 's @entity132 in january but is yet to make his debut for his country at any level			0
considering recent events , however , that may well change in the new year .			0
