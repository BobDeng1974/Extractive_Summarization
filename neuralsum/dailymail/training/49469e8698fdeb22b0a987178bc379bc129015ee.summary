@entity0 has hit out at an @entity2 bias after once again jumping to the defence of @entity4 and @entity5 over accusations of diving			1
@entity0 was angry last week that @entity4 , @entity8 and @entity5 were singled out in the win over @entity10 for alleged diving , and insisted on saturday that a new system of video replays to clamp down on the offence would simply favour @entity16 ’s rivals			1
the @entity16 manager said the focus should instead be on the reckless challenge made by @entity20 on @entity21 , which earned the @entity10 midfielder a red card			1
@entity0 has turned the heat up on the referee ahead of @entity16 's clash with @entity28 midfielder @entity5 was one of @entity16 's players accused of diving during their game against @entity10 @entity16 defender @entity4 was another who was singled out for diving during their 3 - 0 victory @entity0 said : ‘ you speak one week about a dive that was not even a dive and you do n’t speak about @entity21 who could be this moment in hospital with big surgery on his knee or leg			1
’ ahead of monday night ’s trip to @entity28 , @entity0 has again risked incurring the @entity45 ’s wrath by demanding referee @entity46 ‘ does his job ’ at the @entity49			1
under @entity45 rules , managers are not allowed to discuss referees or anything to do with officiating ahead of a game , a move designed to stop the top bosses from piling pressure on officials			2
but @entity0 has placed @entity46 firmly in the spotlight after he was chosen to take charge of the match against a @entity28 side who are regularly criticised for being overly physical			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i like these matches			1
it ’s no problem — with a good referee that can understand what is aggressivity , or when aggressivity finishes and when the rules of the game start			2
‘ we need a good , experienced referee who can understand exactly that , because what happens in both boxes in this kind of matches and we need important decisions : what is aggressivity and what goes beyond the rules of the game			2
‘ i know that it is difficult for every team to play this kind of match but again i ’m not worried			2
the referee is there exactly to judge what is aggressivity			0
and aggressivity i always welcome — it makes the game much more beautiful and difficult			0
‘ but one thing is aggressivity and one thing is to go beyond the rules			0
’ @entity8 was another who was singled out for diving during @entity16 's win at @entity98 @entity10 midfielder @entity20 was sent off for a challenge on @entity16 defender @entity21 @entity0 has placed referee @entity46 firmly in the spotlight ahead of their clash with @entity28 @entity16 lost 3 - 2 at @entity28 last season but @entity0 had no issues with the referee in that game or with @entity28 ’s approach			1
but he will prepare @entity109 goalkeeper @entity108 for the physical strength @entity28 are likely to show in challenging him in the box , as well as @entity8 for the battle he will have with @entity114 , both of whom are travelling to the @entity49 for the first time			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i will speak with @entity108 and we prepare him but the referee is there and the referee has to know what is allowed and what is not allowed according to the rules of the game and the rules of the game are the same everywhere so it should be no problem			1
’ on @entity8 ’s duel with @entity114 , @entity0 said : ‘ one is trying to score goals and one is trying to stop			1
it depends on the way he tries to stop			0
‘ if he stops in clean way and is successful , maybe i will be waiting in the tunnel to congratulate him			0
if he goes beyond what the rules allow , i hope the referee does his job			0
‘ we are physical , too , so it should be no problem for us			0
but we want to play football — and i hope the referee does his job			0
‘ we have our identity			0
we want to play football , we play beautiful football and that ’s what we want to do — but we can cope with physicality , that ’s no problem for us			0
but the referee is there and i ’m not worried because he is there			0
’ @entity0 says he will prepare @entity108 ahead of their visit to @entity28 @entity28 defender @entity114 ( left ) will be the man tasked with stopping @entity8 on monday @entity0 , though , is still nursing a grievance over the @entity156 ’s application of rules , which the @entity16 manager thinks is biased and disproportionate			1
there is a panel of former referees who decide on which players to punish after matches on the basis of video evidence			2
last season @entity168 ’s @entity167 appeared to kick out at @entity170 while the @entity172 player was on the ground , but the panel ruled he did not have a case to answer			0
asked whether video analysis could cut out diving , @entity0 said : ‘ the independent panels do n’t do that job well in any case			1
when you go through to analyse and suspend players by video evidence , it ’s a disaster			2
i remember last season — and i do n’t want to say the names of the clubs or the name of the players — you had players and clubs punished by panels and you had players and clubs protected by panels			2
‘ i saw someone kick someone on the floor in the back — no suspension			0
i saw others with minor things — suspended			0
‘ players are punished for silly comments on @entity204 and @entity205 and players are not punished for other things			2
‘ so independent panels are the same ones that last season analysed my situation against @entity212 and i was punished and suspended			0
’ an @entity156 disciplinary panel fined @entity0 £ 8,000 last season for improper conduct for going on the pitch at @entity212 after @entity217 was sent off and a melee ensued .			1
