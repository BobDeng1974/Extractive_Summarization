half of a power station which supplies electricity to a million homes will remain out of action indefinitely following a major blaze â€“ prompting blackout fears			1
the devastating blaze at the @entity9 b site in @entity10 comes days before @entity11 sets out its winter outlook , amid worries over how it will keep the lights on if there is an ' energy crunch '			2
it is expected to put further pressure on the @entity21 's squeezed electricity network and could result in supply failing to keep up with demand			1
there are no reports of any injuries , according to officials energy secretary @entity35 said @entity11 had assured him that there was no risk to energy supplies but a spokesman for the grid said details of the potential impact on capacity over the winter would not be set out until it publishes its seasonal outlook on october 28 at least 25 fire engines and around 100 firefighters raced battle the flames which ripped through four cooling towers , leaving the plant operating at 50 per cent capacity			1
fire officers are currently investigating the cause of the blaze , but they have ruled out arson and terrorism			1
this is the latest blaze to hit @entity21 's power capacity , with @entity60 and @entity61 crippled by fires earlier this year			1
energy supply has also been hit by plans to close a site at @entity66 in east @entity67			0
at least 25 fire engines and around 100 firefighters battled the flames which ripped through a cooling tower a spokeswoman at @entity71 confirmed investigating officers will visit the scene this morning , and said they are likely to remain there throughout the day it also emerged that four @entity77 nuclear power reactors , which shut down after a defect was discovered , will be operating at three - quarters capacity by the end of this year			1
officials at the @entity83 owned site - who carry out regular safety drills - managed to shut down the @entity9 site quickly to stop the incident turning into an inferno			0
a spokesman for @entity83 said : ' the affected part of the site will remain non-operational until an investigation and repairs can take place			2
it is too early to give any definitive estimate of how long this will be			0
' @entity98 said the plant was only producing half as much power as it normally would for the @entity11 , but that all 70 of its staff who work there were at the station today			1
@entity106 , energy analyst at @entity107 , said the long term impact of the fire on the @entity21 's power supply could be ' significant ' if the damage takes some time to repair the @entity112 opened in july 1997			1
the @entity113 , a combined coal and oil plant , shut last year the company said it will begin its own assessment of the damage once the fire service has left			1
an @entity98 spokesman said : ' one bank of cooling towers has been unaffected which means the station can still operate but it could take a week or two before the plant is fully operational			2
' the assessment of the damage and repair costs wo n't start until the fire service has left			2
' there were no reports of casualties , but @entity132 were advising local residents to keep windows and doors closed because of clouds of billowing smoke			2
energy secretary @entity35 said : ' first , i want to thank the emergency services who are at @entity9 working to tackle the blaze			2
a total of four cooling towers were affected by the blaze and two of those were completely destroyed @entity132 are were advising local residents to keep windows and doors closed because of clouds of billowing smoke the @entity9 incident is the latest blaze to hit @entity21 's power capacity , with @entity60 and @entity61 crippled by fires earlier this year @entity154 : dozens of firemen from across @entity10 and @entity157 were fighting the fire officials at the @entity83 owned site managed to shut down the site quickly to stop the incident turning into an inferno ' i 've been reassured by @entity11 that there is no risk to electricity supplies			1
' i will be keeping in touch with the relevant authorities throughout			0
my priority is to understand the cause of the fire and get the affected unit back generating electricity as soon as it 's safe to do so			2
' but a spokesman for the @entity11 said details of the potential impact on capacity over the winter would not be set out until it publishes its seasonal outlook on october 28			0
the latest outage appears to bring closer a ' last resort ' scenario described by mr @entity35 earlier this year to keep the lights on			0
this would see factories paid to shut down in peak times and mothballed power stations being fired up to supply reserve power			2
@entity98 has said the damaged part of @entity29 will remain non-operational until an insepection and repairs can take place rising : there were no reports of casualties but @entity132 were advising local residents to keep windows and doors closed because of clouds of billowing smoke the @entity21 is facing an energy crunch over the next two winters when the capacity margin - how much its total generating capacity outstrips expected peak demand - is expected to shrink to as little as 2 per cent			1
a spokesman for the @entity210 said : ' the lights will not go out this winter			0
' up and down the country there are power stations on standby that can start pumping out power when needed , and the government has given @entity11 the extra powers it needs to ensure there is enough electricity to keep the lights			2
' there have been some unexpected closures over the past few months and @entity11 is buying some extra energy supply to make up for any shortfall			0
' the government will continue to work with @entity11 and energy providers to make sure the system remains secure over the coming months			0
' fire crews spray water on to the @entity230 , which generates electricity using natural gas a spokesman for @entity83 said : ' we can confirm that no one is injured which is clearly the most important thing and also that the fire is now under control ' energy secretary @entity35 said : ' first , i want to thank the emergency services who are at @entity9 working to tackle the blaze ' it is not clear how the @entity9 fire started , but officials have ruled out arson or terrorism			1
@entity10 's assistant chief fire officer , @entity248 , said the blaze began in one of @entity29 power station 's cooling towers and spread to three other towers			1
mr @entity248 said : ' we responded to the scene and worked well to extinguish the fire			0
' we work closely in partnership with the power station to ensure we have plans in place should an incident of this nature actually happen			1
' the fire itself was extinguished quickly - there are no reports of injuries , which of course is pleasing			2
' we have three fire engines on - scene still , dampening down hot spots and we will continue to have a presence there for at least the next 24 hours			1
' an investigation has begun in conjunction with other agencies regarding the cause of the fire			0
' i expect that it will take some time to determine the reasons behind what actually happened			0
' power station has dominated @entity10 skyline since building work started on the @entity113 in the 1960s around 12 fire crews attended the power station at around 9pm , but that number doubled as flames took hold it is not clear how the fire started , but fire service officials have ruled out arson or terrorism the charred remains of the cooling towers are seen at the plant , which is around 70 miles west of @entity67 resident @entity300 said : ' i looked across at the power station and there was this bright light			1
i got my camera and zoomed in and realised one of the towers was alight ' local resident @entity309 tweeted : ' it was well alight			0
lots of fire brigade , police and helicopters ... ' fellow @entity9 local @entity315 said : ' it still looked very bad even after an hour			0
' @entity300 told the @entity318 newspaper : ' i live on @entity319 and i looked across at the power station and there was this bright light			1
' i got my camera and zoomed in and realised one of the towers was alight			0
' it burnt so fiercely that it spread to the next one			0

the @entity113 , a combined coal and oil plant , shut last year			0
its three giant cooling towers were demolished in july			0
hundreds watched as the blast , using more than 400lb of explosives , flattened 36,000 tons of material in seconds			0
a spokesman for the @entity210 has said there will be no blackouts this winter an 2012 image of the the power station , which was built in the 1960s , before three of the cooling towers were demolished the @entity230 's three giant cooling towers were demolished in july using more than 400lb of explosives			1

around 25 fire engines and 100 firefighters battled flames at @entity29 plant
half of the power station will remain out of action indefinitely *due* to damage
expected to put further pressure on the @entity21 's squeezed electricity network
fire officers are investigating cause of blaze , ruled out arson and terrorism
there were no injuries , but residents have been told to keep windows closed
