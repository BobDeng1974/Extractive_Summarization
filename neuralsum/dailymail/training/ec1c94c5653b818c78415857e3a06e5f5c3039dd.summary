by @entity0 published : 21:37 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 04:15 est , 20 june 2012 members of @entity3 invested £ 26million in a scheme that @entity5 believes is designed to avoid tax , it was claimed last night			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and their manager , @entity10 , are among 1,000 people who contributed £ 480million to 62 partnerships in music industry investment schemes that act as tax shelters for wealthy individuals , according to @entity16			1
@entity5 is attempting to shut down the partnerships , run by a company called @entity19 , at a tax tribunal in november			1
@entity7 – who was recently made an @entity21 – and company could face paying back millions of pounds if it is successful			1
' seeking haven ' : fellow @entity3 stars @entity9 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) are also said to have invested in the scheme , which @entity5 is attempting to shut down a spokesman for @entity5 said : ‘ we do not accept that the @entity19 tax schemes have the tax effects their promoters claim			1
’ they said one @entity19 scheme had already been successfully challenged			0
@entity33 denied that its partnerships were designed to avoid tax			2
it said they were intended to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘ creative and artistic material and [ creating ] taxable profits ’			1
' taking shelter ' : take that member and x factor judge @entity7 ( pictured ) is one of 1,000 people who have contributed £ 480million in partnerships in investment schemes designed to avoid tax , it has been claimed @entity54 records show that the three @entity3 members and their manager joined two icebreaker partnerships in march 2010 and september 2011			1
in the first , they put in £ 5.2million of their own cash and borrowed another £ 20.8million			1
the partnership registered a loss in the year to april 2010 of £ 25.2million , which accounts show as ‘ available for discretionary division among members ’			0
according to @entity16 , @entity67 , working on behalf of @entity33 , told an undercover reporter that the men had also invested in a second partnership , which has not yet filed accounts			0
lawyers representing @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and mr @entity10 said the men had paid significant amounts of tax			1
they confirmed that their clients were investors in the two partnerships , but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax - avoidance schemes			2
there is no suggestion that other members of @entity3 were investors – and it is not known whether those that did were aware of the tax benefits when they invested in the partnerships			0
but the revelation comes after it emerged that comedian @entity88 is one of thousands using a legal off - shore scheme to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax			0
@entity88 , who has publicly mocked tax avoidance schemes , is believed to be the largest beneficiary of a @entity94 - based accountancy arrangement said to shelter £ 168million a year from the taxman			2
he puts away £ 3.3million a year via the @entity98 tax scheme , which is used by more than 1,000 tax avoiders , it was claimed			1
@entity98 works by transferring salaries into a @entity94 - based trust , which lends investors back the money			0
because the loan can technically be recalled , it is not subject to income tax			0
a typical @entity19 partnership collects around £ 10million from about a dozen investors and uses the funds to buy music rights in upcoming and established artists			2
@entity33 can help investors to save more in tax than they put into the scheme with losses being offset by a wealthy investor against other income earned during the previous three years			0
investors can bump up this tax relief by taking out offshore loans arranged by @entity33			0
for a minimum investment of £ 40,000 into an @entity33 partnership , boosted by an offshore loan of £ 160,000 , a member can generate £ 77,520 of tax relief			2
a person who invests £ 200,000 in cash can earn £ 1million tax free .			0
