by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 12:40 est , 13 november 2012 holidays are coming ! and with them comes the dreaded @entity3 - the pounds the average woman gains over the festive season			1
but apparently we no longer have to simply sit back ( by a crackling fire , with an eggnog and mince pie in hand , of course ) and watch this happen			1
glamour model @entity13 has staged a pre-emptive strike against @entity16 's bulge , treating herself to a round of liposuction to blast her muffin tops before @entity20			1
and celebrity @entity30 contestant hopes to ensure that once 2013 rolls around she 's already back to the size she is now			1
research shows that the average woman gails 5lb over the @entity20 and @entity36 holiday thanks to an excess of brandy butter , potatoes roasted in goose fat , candy canes and alcohol			1
but rather than waiting until january to shed that extra flab , stars worried about their figures - including @entity46 of once - defunct boy band @entity47 , and former @entity49 @entity48 - are getting the lipo lasers out in november			2
one @entity25 clinic has seen a 33 per cent rise in bookings for its non-invasive liposuction procedure in the run - up to @entity20			1
feel the love ( handles ) : @entity59 model @entity58 pinches her muffin tops before the non-invasive operation the 32 - year - old mother - of - two , who is married to @entity64 footballer @entity63 , had the @entity24 treatment on @entity26 's @entity25 at the @entity67 clinic			1
she said : ' we all need a bit of help shifting those stubborn areas of fat - even if , like me , you eat well and exercise regularly			2
' i decided to have the treatment now because i know with two hungry young boys and a footballer husband , there is going to be so much pigging out at @entity20			2
' if i get working on my muffin tops now i â€™ll have a bit of a " get out of jail free " card and wo n't be so guilty if i put on a few pounds at @entity20			2
' i know that if i do put on a few pounds my muffin tops will only go back to the old shape because @entity24 has made them much smaller			0
i guess you could call it my little " insurance policy "			0
' @entity16 's little helper : @entity13 , pictured with @entity20 , left , and on @entity88 's i 'm a celebrity ...			0
in 2008 , hopes her round of pre-emptive liposuction will allow her to indulge at the festive dinner table @entity24 is a new technique which has become increasingly popular with both men and women who want a quick beauty fix but and do n't want to go under the knife			1
it can help stubborn areas like muffin tops and bingo wings in one 60 - minute session by using a cyrongenic machine which works by first gently heating and then rapidly cooling the target area			0
this causes the fat cells to crystallise and , as a result , fatty deposits are permanently destroyed			0
the body then naturally eliminates them as waste tissue over the next few weeks			0
@entity111 , co-founder of @entity67 , said : ' we have found that november and december have become really busy periods			0
' lots of women know that they are going to put on a few pounds over @entity20 and they want to take action now rather wait till the @entity36			0
they know if they look fantastic before @entity20 it is an incentive to go easy on the turkey and the pigs - in - blankets			0
