as the election race hots up , @entity1 leader @entity0 is getting a small taste of what it might be like to be a member of @entity7			1
a group of female fans , who 've dubbed themselves the ' @entity10 ' , are rallying support for the opposition leader on social media using the @entity15 hashtag # milifandom			1
the largely teenage fanbase have spent the days running up to the may 7th election posting tweets of affection for the politician			0
led by @entity15 user @ twcuddleston , an as levels student by the name of @entity27 , the unlikely fan club has prompted hundreds of tweets from fellow users who share their admiration for the @entity1 leader			1
my heart belongs to @entity0 ! the @entity34 ( pictured in @entity35 yesterday ) has been the subject of a social media storm in recent days as a group of fans , mainly teenagers , have posted their affection for him under the # milifandom hashtag behind the @entity45 hashtag is @ twcuddleston , an @entity47 student who appears to be a genuine @entity1 supporter			1
her tweets in support of @entity0 have led to lots of other women posting tweets of affection for him fearing a gaffe , the @entity1 leader has remained tight - lipped on what he makes of the @entity57 but did tweet back the teen behind it , @ twcuddleston in her @entity15 profile , she describes herself as ' leader of the @entity63 , a movement against the distorted media portrayal of @entity66 ' and even she is amazed at just how the hashtag has taken off , saying ' there are those in the milifandom , those who find the milifandom funny , and those who wonder how the hell @entity0 has a fandom			1
' perhaps fearing a gaffe , the @entity1 leader has remained tight - lipped on what he makes of the @entity57 but did tweet the teen behind it , @ twcuddleston , saying ' @entity27 - delighted that you 've joined @entity1 - welcome			1
' while @entity27 seems to be a genuine @entity1 supporter and a level - headed teen - she 's declined giving interviews in favour of revising for her upcoming exams , others seem to be more preoccupied with @entity0 's physical appearance than his abilities to run the country			1
one user @ @entity94 defended criticism of @entity0 , saying he 's ' not " mouldy " , he 's hot ! ' another , @ helenamelia_xox , said ' if i ever met ed miliband i actually would cry he 's so hot			2
' admirer , @entity99 , also chimed in : ' this all started out as a joke but now i think i legitimately fancy @entity0			0
' one user @ @entity94 defended criticism of @entity0 , saying he 's ' not " mouldy " , he 's hot ! ' another , @ helenamelia_xox , said ' if i ever met ed miliband i actually would cry he 's so hot ' maybe one day : @entity1 fan @ @entity104 dreams that @entity0 will visit her in the @entity105 teen angst : @ theurbanangel described her crush on @entity0 as ' painful ' internet jokers have also got in on the act , posting mocked - up images of @entity0 as various heartthrobs			1
@ @entity113 seems particularly adept at it and has morphed the opposition leader 's face onto a series of scenes from @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 amongst others			0
@ @entity123 admitted to @entity124 that he felt a little guilty about his @entity126 satire , saying : ' i 'm actually feeling quite guilty about jumping on the # milifandom thing			2
' i 've been doing satirical political photoshops for a couple of years now and had a load of @entity0 ones already on file			0
' unlikely heartthrob : images of the opposition leader looking sultry for a newspaper article have been shared by @entity15 users in an attempt to make the @entity1 leader look cool , @entity15 users have begun editing his face on to the body of famous men , including @entity144 as @entity145 in movie @entity146 @entity148 : dressed in a suave grey suit , the @entity1 leader is superimposed on yet another photograph of secret agent , @entity145 @entity152 : while tv viewers swooned over @entity154 's @entity119 , @entity0 has consistently polled low in popularity ratings not buying it : the drastic reworking of @entity0 comes after he gained a reputation for appearing in awkward pictures , including eating a bacon sandwich ( pictured here on the body of @entity163 , from @entity164 ) he continues : ' this morning i saw a tweet by the young woman who i think originated # milifandom and it seems she was doing it because she supports @entity1 and does n't like the way @entity0 is portrayed			1
' the @entity15 mischief - maker , who declined to reveal his real identity , said he 'd had over 1000 retweets of his images yesterday			2
while @entity0 may be revelling in a very different type of attention to what he 's used to , he 's keeping schtum on the subject so far although he has tweeted @ twcuddleston to thank her for her support of the @entity1			2
fellow @entity1 members have noticed the hysteria though , with shadow justice secretary @entity186 tweeting ' and i thought i was an @entity188 fan … # milifandom			2
' such adoration is a feeling that @entity0 may not have expected but now might be getting used to			0
@entity0 was mobbed by a screaming hen party – and even let the bride on his tour bus for a private ' selfie ' the bride - to - be 's sister , @entity195 , posted a picture of @entity198 and @entity0 on the campaign bus just last week , the @entity1 leader was mobbed by a screaming hen party - and even let the bride on his tour bus for a ' selfie '			1
@entity0 was jokingly referred to as the stripper after his battle bus was gatecrashed by bride - to - be @entity207 and her friends			0
one of the group from @entity210 spotted the leader 's bus when she popped outside the @entity213 for a cigarette and quickly alerted the bride			0
after brief negotiations with his spin doctors , the solicitor was allowed on the bus and emerged grinning after a few minutes in a white and blue dress , saying : ' i got a full on picture with him '			0
she was met by whoops and cheers from the raucous group of hens , all wearing black dresses and pink sashes , who started yelling for him to come and meet them			0
the @entity1 leader then appeared and high - fived a few of the women before they started chanting ' @entity233 ! selfie ! @entity233 ! ' and turned their backs on him for a group shot			2
one of the women was heard saying : ' @entity239 ' and the group erupted into giggles before mr @entity0 made his excuses and waved goodbye			0
