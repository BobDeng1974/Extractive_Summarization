dr @entity2 , 62 , was employed to cut waiting lists at @entity8 in @entity9 by carrying out cataract operations at weekends			1
his employers compensated four of his patients after botched operations prompted legal claims			1
three lost their remaining sight in the eye while the fourth was ‘ severely visually impaired ’			0
but the consultant ophthalmic surgeon was allowed to continue working in @entity18 after a @entity20 panel stopped short of imposing a ban in 2007 and said that conditions were enough to protect the public			0
three years later a review panel extended the conditions , which were due to expire next month , but the doctor has been struck off at the @entity27 in @entity28			2
the panel decided the doctor , who has not worked in the @entity18 since 2003 , had not shown enough insight into his actions or any evidence that his skills had improved			0
chair @entity34 said : ‘ the panel considers dr @entity2 to have demonstrated a persistent lack of insight into the seriousness of the consequences of both his deficient performance and lack of commitment to remediation			1
‘ the panel has concluded that these departures from good medical practice pose a serious risk to patients and to the public interest , and are therefore so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with continued registration			0
’ eye surgeon : @entity2 was employed to cut waiting lists at @entity8 ( pictured ) in @entity9 she added : ‘ accordingly , the panel has determined that , in order to protect patients , to maintain public confidence in the profession and to declare and uphold proper standards , erasure is a necessary and proportionate sanction in this case			1
‘ the panel recognises that this removes dr @entity2 ’s ability to practise medicine in the @entity18 but considers that , in all the circumstances , this is an appropriate response to the risks posed by his lack of insight and apparent unwillingness to engage in remediation			1
‘ the panel has therefore determined to erase dr @entity2 ’s name from the medical register			1
’ during the 2007 hearing , @entity2 claimed the cases were ‘ more complicated ’ than the ones he dealt with in @entity5			2
the surgeon was recruited through @entity78 , a @entity5 company which sources doctors to provide services in @entity18			0
within months of taking up the post his bosses became worried about his rising rate of post-operative complications			0
an audit of 50 patients found 26 per cent had pre-operative problems compared with the national average of just 7 per cent			0
and 40 per cent had post-op complications - almost double the expected rate			0
it emerged that 20 of @entity2 ’s 69 patients had experienced significant problems following surgery			2
in one test @entity2 correctly answered 49 out of 135 questions			0
the minimum for a pass is 90			0
@entity2 was not present or represented at his final hearing , but has previously stated in emails to the @entity20 that he had no intention of returning to @entity18			2
ms @entity34 said : ‘ there is no evidence before the panel to indicate that dr @entity2 has remedied any of the deficiencies in his performance in any way in the three - year period since the last review was undertaken			1
' dr @entity2 ’s professional practice remains deficient ' @entity34 , @entity27 panel chair ‘ further , whilst the doctor has given brief details of his work in @entity5 there is no independent verification of the standard of his practice			1
‘ in the absence of any independent evidence that dr @entity2 ’s practice no longer poses a risk to patients , the panel has concluded that dr @entity2 ’s professional practice remains deficient			1
’ she added : ‘ dr @entity2 ’s lack of engagement and insight casts significant doubt upon his willingness to respond positively to the retraining that is required to address his deficiencies			1
‘ he has failed to appreciate and act upon the findings about his unacceptable performance , which might give rise to harm to patients and to the reputation of the profession			0
‘ further , the doctor ’s disregard for his obligations in respect of his professional regulator , regardless of the fact that it is , for him , in an overseas jurisdiction , could seriously damage the reputation of the medical profession and undermine public confidence in doctors			0
’ @entity2 will be struck off the medical register 28 days after he receives notification of the decision , subject to appeal .			2
