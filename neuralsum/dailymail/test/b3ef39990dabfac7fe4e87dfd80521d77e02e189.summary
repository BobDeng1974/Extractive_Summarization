the @entity0 will continue to accept donations from foreign governments despite the risk of a conflict of interest now that its founder is running for the @entity6			2
the charity announced on wednesday that it has decided to continue to look abroad for millions of dollars while limiting donor nations to a select group of six			0
the change in policy comes as former board member @entity12 undertakes her presidential campaign			1
the foundation 's reliance on funding from several @entity18 governments that suppress dissent and women 's rights — concerns that the @entity22 focused on during her stint as secretary of state — sparked criticism and gave @entity27 a new offensive against the leading @entity29			1
@entity30 resigned from the foundation 's board last week			1
she resigned from the board of the @entity30 foundation last week the @entity42 , @entity12 and @entity43 's board said on wednesday night that future donations will only be allowed from the governments of @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , the @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity51 — all nations that previously supported the charity 's health , poverty and climate change programs			1
longtime @entity59 allies , the six maintain relatively uncontroversial ties to the @entity59 while direct contributions from other governments would be halted , those nations could continue participating in the @entity64 , a subsidiary program that encourages donors to match contributions from others to tackle international problems without direct donations to the charity			0
donations greater that $ 25million @entity72 @entity73 ( @entity47 ) @entity74 @entity75 , the @entity76 @entity77 @entity78 @entity79 donations $ 10 - $ 25million @entity81 @entity82 @entity83 @entity84 government of @entity50 the @entity86 * @entity87 * the @entity88 @entity89 and @entity90 & the @entity91 * the @entity92 @entity93 however , the foundation will stop holding @entity64 meetings abroad — a final session is scheduled for @entity97 in may — and most foreign governments will no longer be allowed to sponsor programs			1
@entity0 donations between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $ 55 million and $ 130 million			0
in addition to the six nations that will be allowed to continue donating , the others were @entity87 , @entity109 , @entity110 , the @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and the @entity117			0
the foundation also will begin disclosing its donors every quarter instead of annually — an answer to long - standing criticism that the foundation 's once - a - year lists made it difficult to view shifts and trends in the charity 's funding			1
former president @entity30 and other foundation officials have long defended the charity 's transparency , but the new move signaled sensitivity to those concerns , particularly as his wife begins her race for the @entity6			0
@entity12 's campaign referred questions about the board 's action to the foundation			2
last month , while she was still a board member , @entity30 defended the family charity to questions about its reliance on donations from foreign governments , saying the foundation had ' hundreds of thousands of donors			1
' foundation spokesman @entity150 said that under the new disclosure policy , ' the @entity0 is reinforcing its commitment to accountability while protecting programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around the world '			0
but he also insisted that the old annual disclosure policy went ' above and beyond what 's required by voluntarily disclosing our more than 300,000 donors on our website for anyone to see '			0
@entity12 had previously agreed with the @entity165 administration to limit new foreign donations to the foundation while she served as secretary of state , but at least six nations that previously contributed still donated to the charity during her four - year stint			2
@entity42 and @entity12 address the audience during a @entity64 event last september in @entity174			0
donations to their foundation between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $ 55 million and $ 130 million @entity30 in @entity87 for the @entity181 in 2011			2
@entity87 has been a generous donor to the @entity0 - but will not be allowed to donate while @entity12 makes her bid for the @entity6 due to criticism over @entity18 governments which suppress dissent and women 's rights in one case , the foundation failed to notify the @entity22 about a donation from the government of @entity112			1
@entity0 officials had hinted in recent weeks that the organization was considering new limits on foreign government donations after several media accounts this year raised questions about the foundation 's reliance on those practices			1
the foundation 's board began discussions over the past two days about altering some of the charity 's procedures in an effort that officials said was aimed at improving transparency without harming fundraising for critical programs			1
potential problems may exist among some of the six governments that will be allowed to continue providing direct donations to the foundation			2
for examples , the @entity47 @entity216 , which has already given the foundation between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 , has pushed for the approval of the @entity220			2
the project is a domestic flashpoint in the climate change debate as well as a contentious issue regarding its impact on jobs and oil supplies			0
president @entity165 has yet to decide whether to approve the pipeline , which would span several @entity59 states , but he has already vetoed one bill aimed at swiftly approving the plan			0
foundation officials said the charity is not involved in the @entity220 issue and has a ' strong program ' aimed at curbing reducing carbon emissions .			0

future donations will only be allowed from the governments of @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , the @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity51
the change in policy comes as former board member @entity12 hits the presidential campaign trail
