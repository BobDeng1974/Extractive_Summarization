failure : the unmanned mission went awry when the engine on the third stage of the @entity5 booster rocket failed 100 miles up a @entity7 rocket ferrying one of @entity10 's most powerful satellites into space has exploded in the earth 's atmosphere , setting the former @entity16 state 's commercial space program back ' three to four years '			1
@entity7 's workhorse @entity5 was carrying the $ 275 - million express @entity19 satellite when it failed and burned up this morning , destroying the telecommunications module intended to bring high - speed internet to remote parts of the country			1
it was the second failure for the @entity5 in less than a year , and the second time that it had failed to deliver such a @entity10 satellite , after the last one crashed shortly after launch in 2011			2
friday 's unmanned mission went awry when the engine on the third stage of the @entity5 booster rocket failed , @entity30 , head of the @entity31 @entity31 , told @entity7 news agencies			2
he said the precise cause was unknown			0
the failure occurred at an altitude of 160 km ( 100 miles ) , about nine minutes after the early - morning lift - off from the @entity7 - leased @entity38 facility in @entity39			1
the state - run @entity40 quoted @entity30 as saying that the rocket and all debris had burned up in the atmosphere : ' we can say with certainty that nothing reached @entity48			2
' however , @entity7 media said some debris may have fallen into the @entity51 or been scattered over @entity52 and @entity7 's @entity53			1
no casualties or damage were reported on the ground			0
the lost @entity19 satellite , worth more than 200 million euros ( $ 275 million ) , was described by its maker @entity58 , a unit of the @entity10 aerospace group @entity59 , as one of the most powerful satellites built in @entity10			1
its loss delays a number of commercial projects by three to four years			1
' it 's a heavy blow , of course			0
and the thing is that our workhorse rocket - our most powerful and the most - used rocket - has such a bad record , ' @entity69 , head of the @entity7 - based @entity70 think tank , told @entity75			2
trouble in the sky : a @entity5 rocket carrying the @entity80 @entity79 telecommunication satellite blasts off at @entity81 2007			0
but it has suffered a series of mishaps since embarrassing : in september 2007 , the @entity5 's booster rocket crashed destroying the @entity88 @entity87 communications satellite on board			0
pictured is the crash site near @entity92 , in @entity39 he said the rocket had a 7 percent failure rate , and its unreliability was making it harder for @entity7 to compete in the multibillion - dollar global satellite launch industry , giving a boost to its @entity10 rival @entity100 and the @entity102 newcomer @entity103			1
' it 's a very unsuccessful picture on the whole and , if you compare it with our main competitors , with @entity10 , their last accident was 12 years ago , ' @entity69 said			0
last july , three navigation satellites worth about $ 200 million were lost when the @entity5 rocket crashed near the launch pad shortly after take - off			1
that accident strained relations between @entity39 and @entity7 and led @entity39 to temporarily ban @entity5 launches from @entity38			0
state - run @entity117 television said all launches had been suspended from @entity39 after friday 's failure .			0

it 's 2nd failure for @entity7 's workhorse @entity5 rocket in less than a year
the failure occurred at an altitude of 100 miles , nine minutes after lift - off
@entity7 says all debris had burned up in the atmosphere , none fell to @entity48
but @entity7 media says debris may have fallen into @entity51 or on @entity52
the lost @entity19 satellite , worth $ 275m , was @entity10 's most powerful
its loss delays a number of commercial projects by three to four years
