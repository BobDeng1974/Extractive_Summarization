by @entity0 despite now being located on the opposite sides of the globe , southern @entity1 and the @entity2 used to be neighbours			2
that 's what a study of @entity9 's oldest rocks has revealed			1
minerals present in rocks in the island state 's north , dating from an ocean more than 1.3 billion years ago , contain traces of other minerals - monazite and zircon			1
minerals present in rocks in the island state 's north , and dating from an ocean more than 1.3 billion years ago , contain traces of minerals monazite ( pictured left ) and zircon ( right )			1
experts believe the samples prove that @entity9 and the @entity25 were once neighbours the minerals were extracted from sedimentary rocks from the @entity29 in @entity9 , where they were once deposited in an ancient ocean between 1.45 and 1.33 billion years ago – making them the oldest rocks in @entity9			1
researchers from the @entity34 dated the minerals and found a pattern common to sedimentary rocks from the @entity25 states of @entity38 and @entity39 , as well as parts of @entity42 province @entity41			1
according to the study , published in the journal @entity45 , the result was ‘ a strong genetic fingerprint and evidence ’ that @entity9 's @entity47 was geographically close about 1.4 billion years ago to a basin that stretches through parts of @entity42 and the @entity25 the minerals were extracted from sedimentary rocks from the @entity29 ( pictured ) in north west @entity9 , where they were once deposited in an ancient ocean between 1.45 and 1.33 billion years ago - making them the oldest rocks in @entity9 lead researcher @entity55 explained : ‘ at this time , both @entity9 and @entity56 were part of a supercontinent called @entity59			1
‘ as plate tectonics and the supercontinent cycle started to rift @entity59 apart , a large sedimentary basin formed that included the @entity29 and @entity65 rocks			2
’ the continued breakup of @entity59 eventually dispersed parts of this ancient sedimentary basin to opposite sides of the @entity70			1
dr @entity72 , also at the university , said that the new mineral dates also provide an age constraint for the @entity76 fossils that were recently discovered in the @entity29			0
these ‘ string of beads ’ fossils have also previously been found in the @entity78 rocks			1
fossils visible to the naked eye are exceedingly rare from rocks older than 635 million years			2
horodyskia from the @entity29 and the @entity87 are nearly twice this age , ’ he said			2
how @entity89 could have ruled the world : this image shows how the @entity70 might have looked if @entity92 had been split in two			0
the move would have left a huge ocean south of today 's @entity96 desert , creating a @entity97 and a @entity96 @entity97 researchers have revealed a fascinating glimpse of how the world could have looked - if a shift in the @entity70 's tectonic plates had taken a slightly different turn			2
@entity1 researchers said in march that the break - up of the supercontinent @entity106 about 130 million years ago could have lead to a completely different shape of the @entity110 and @entity89 continent			1
they explained that the move would have left a huge ocean south of today ’s @entity96 desert , creating a @entity97 and a @entity113			0
geoscientists from the @entity115 and the @entity116 used sophisticated plate tectonic and three - dimensional numerical modelling to recreate the shift - but with a different twist			0
the researchers said that the shift that left @entity92 it its present location was almost very different			0
' extension along the @entity97 and @entity110 rift systems was about to split the @entity110 - @entity89 part of @entity127 into nearly equal halves , generating a @entity97 and a @entity113 ' , geoscientist @entity123 said			0
' in a dramatic plate tectonic twist , however , a competing rift along the present - day @entity131 @entity97 margins , won over the @entity110 rift , causing it to become extinct , avoiding the break - up of the @entity110 continent and the formation of a @entity136			0
' the team believe that their study highlights the importance of rift orientation relative to extension direction as key factor deciding whether an ocean basin opens or an aborted rift basin forms in the continental interior			0
for hundreds of millions of years , the southern continents of @entity89 , @entity92 , @entity147 , @entity1 , and @entity148 were united in the supercontinent @entity106			0
while the causes for @entity106 's fragmentation are still debated , it is clear that the supercontinent first split along the @entity154 coast in a western and eastern part before separation of @entity89 from @entity92 took place .			0

rocks in @entity9 's north contain traces of minerals monazite and zircon
they were deposited in an ocean between 1.45 and 1.33 billion years ago
@entity34 researchers found a pattern common to sedimentary rocks from the @entity25 states of @entity38 and @entity39 and @entity41
' minerals are a strong genetic fingerprint and evidence ’ that @entity9 and parts of @entity42 and the @entity25 are *prehistoric* neighbours
