goal : sergeant @entity7 hopes to become the first double - amputee to walk to the @entity27 high hopes : sergeant @entity7 is one of six injured @entity20 soldiers hoping to take part in @entity32 tough : they are currently training in @entity13 where temperatures drop to minus @entity35 and winds reach 50mph sergeant @entity7 was told by doctors he would never walk again after his vehicle was blown up by a @entity40 roadside bomb when he was serving with the @entity41			1
but the 34 - year - old has now learned to ski and is aiming to become a record - breaker by being the first double amputee to ski to the @entity6			1
' i volunteered to do this to show what amputees can do , " he said after spending five days and nights on @entity47 in @entity13			2
' it would be great to see more and more amputees reach the pole			0
' hopefully i wo n't be the last , and if i get there and find out an easier way of doing it , then other people can follow in my footsteps and do it as well			0
' determined : sergeant @entity7 was told by doctors he would never walk again after his vehicle was blown up by a roadside bomb a member of the walking with the wounded team falls during training on the @entity67 in @entity13 competition : three teams are getting ready to take on the @entity70 sergeant @entity7 has been in @entity13 with other wounded men and women from the @entity20 , @entity23 , @entity74 and @entity75 to familiarise himself with the conditions the teams will face in @entity78			1
they have camped out on the glacial ice , melted snow for water each morning and night and eaten freeze - dried rations			2
sgt @entity7 said the conditions have been a strain , but he has learned to adapt			2
' it 's had its challenges to be honest , ' he said			0
' it 's not easy learning to ski and then go out for four days covering quite a lot of mileage			0
but it 's been a great learning curve			0
' asked if he has a particular technique , he added : ' it is a little bit ad hoc , but you 've got to find your way of doing it and find a rhythm , but once you do that , it 's amazing how much distance you can cover in a day			0
heavy luggage : the wounded servicemen and women from the @entity20 , @entity23 , @entity74 and @entity75 trekked for more than 15 miles each day dragging sledges , known as pulks , weighing 130lb varied : each team has members with injuries ranging from post traumatic stress disorder ( @entity112 ) to total blindness and gunshot wounds ' you 've got to be quite hot on your personal administration			0
you 've got to really look after your stumps			0
' the last things you want to do is get any rubs , and blisters , or indeed in these temperatures , any frostbite or injuries like that on them			0
' with temperatures in @entity13 dropping to minus @entity35 and winds reaching 50mph , the wounded servicemen and women from the @entity20 , @entity23 , @entity74 and @entity75 trekked for more than 15 miles each day dragging sledges , known as pulks , weighing 130lb			1
they camped out on the ice , melted ice inside their tents and ate freeze - dried rations - exactly what they will do to survive the treacherous @entity78 plateau			0
each team has members with injuries ranging from double leg amputations to post traumatic stress disorder ( @entity112 ) , and total blindness to gunshot wounds			0
no easy feat : the challenge involves a 200 - mile walk across the southern wilderness team work : some of the soldiers who have been training in @entity13 for the last week they will face huge challenges on the 200 - mile walk in the southern wilderness , which is extremely hazardous even for people without profound physical and mental injury			1
the walking with @entity156 charity successfully reached the @entity27 in 2011 in an expedition which prince @entity158 joined for five days , and last year an attempt to reach the summit of @entity161 was called off because conditions on the mountain were too dangerous			1
three teams of four for the @entity6 expedition will be picked in the coming weeks			1
@entity166 , who now lives in @entity167 in @entity168 , will then find out if he has been selected for @entity169 , the @entity20 team for the walking with the @entity171			2
