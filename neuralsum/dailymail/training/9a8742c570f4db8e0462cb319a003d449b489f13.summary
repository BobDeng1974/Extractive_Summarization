pace on the pitch and patience among the paying public			2
will that be enough to see off the proven winners in hot pursuit ? a nation awaits the answer			2
the lunchtime clash between the top two in @entity10 ’s second tier is of interest far beyond the core supports of either @entity13 or @entity14 ; events in @entity16 will provide a focal point , taking point and – almost certainly – starting point for arguments and opinions the length and breadth of the country			1
@entity29 , the debate surrounding the respective merits of the @entity28 challengers has already started			1
and it does rather feel as if the weight of opinion is veering strongly towards the home side at @entity34			2
@entity13 , who are currently six points clear at the top of the @entity28 , face @entity14 on saturday shortly after seeing both protagonists up close , @entity38 made a snap judgment to declare @entity13 the more dominant and potent force			1
he qualifies that a little now , pointing out that his @entity43 team had faced the @entity44 in @entity45 while @entity14 had toughed it out in the dreich surroundings of @entity47			1
for all his talk of the quality available to @entity14 , though , @entity38 still seems to be leaning towards a home win – for reasons beyond touch , technique and tactics			1
the former @entity14 and @entity56 player , who likens the fixture to the winner - takes - all @entity59 ‘ title deciders ’ of old , told @entity61 : ‘ the pace of @entity13 is really something			1
‘ but i ’ll tell you another factor			0
do you know , we were drawing one each with @entity13 at half - time , @entity43 against a team flying high , a team expected to batter us – and they were n’t booed off the pitch at half - time			1
‘ out of all the games that we ’ve played , that ’s the one that stuck with me			0
the @entity13 fans would n’t even think of booing their team at 1 - 1 at half - time against @entity43 , bottom of the league with one point			1
‘ @entity84 were booed when we went 2 - 1 up with half an hour to go			0
so i think it ’s a massive thing that the @entity13 supporters are sticking with them , irrespective of how the game is going			1
‘ it ’s because they ’re young bucks , they ’re playing with enthusiasm			0
the fans are just saying : “ away you go , give it everything – we ’re right behind you ”			0
@entity97 's side drew their last game but won eight consecutive matches before that ‘ supporters are entitled to boo			2
@entity13 fans would have every right to boo their team off at 1 - 1 against us			1
but they did n’t do it			0
‘ i think that ’ll be a major plus for the @entity13 players because , as the season goes on , there will be nervous and anxious times , fighting to be top of the league			1
the fact that those fans seem willing to stick with them is a great thing for the players			0
’ all the understanding in the world , of course , is n’t worth more than a goal - scoring striker or a solid defence			0
in pure football terms , it would be utterly daft to write off a @entity14 team who had put together an eight - game winning run before last weekend ’s slip - up at home to @entity131			1
‘ out on the park , @entity13 have the pace to hurt you - they do have more pace than @entity14 , ’ said @entity38			1
‘ but you know it takes different ways to win a football match			0
people say : “ oh , @entity14 do n’t have the pace of @entity13 ”			1
yeah but they still went on that long winning run and they could still be only three points behind after this weekend			0
‘ it does n’t matter , we ’ve all got different styles , different players and different types			0
do @entity13 give you more problems than @entity14 do ? yes			1
but they ’re different problems			0
’ @entity13 boss @entity155 's ( left ) side have only lost one @entity28 game all season two men previously prolific in a @entity14 shirt were recruited in the summer to help provide the goals required to win promotion			1
while @entity162 ( four ) and @entity163 ( two ) have yet to set the @entity28 alight following their returns to @entity165 , @entity38 insists the duo are still playing their part for @entity97 ’s men			1
‘ @entity14 have @entity163 and @entity162 , and a good way of using them , ’ he continued			1
‘ @entity13 have good players with pace – it ’s two different styles			1
‘ for me , i know @entity163 and @entity162 are n’t the way they used to be			0
but the threat is always there			0
‘ can you deal with that ? you try – but you ca n’t take away from their quality			0
give them half a yard and they ’ll finish			0
‘ it ’s ok to say they ’re maybe not the players they were			0
you ca n’t avoid the fact that they ’ll punish any lapse in concentration			0
it ’s also hard to score goals against @entity14			1
‘ @entity14 were on an unbeaten run of eight games before they drew at home to @entity131 , which was a surprise to everybody			2
‘ @entity13 look like they ’re going to drop points at home to the likes of us or some of the other boys ? you would say no. ‘ but then you would have expected @entity14 to beat @entity131 , having been in great form			1
’ @entity163 ( left ) and @entity162 have both returned to @entity14 but are not the players they once were with six points between the clubs currently , a victory for either on saturday would be significant			1
hearts have the momentum after last weekend but @entity38 is aware that such things can be fleeting			2
‘ @entity14 could win on saturday and that changes everything , ’ he said			1
‘ the boys asked me after @entity14 beat us 3 - 0 at our place , what did i think ( about who the better was )			2
i had to say @entity13 , because they were the most convincing winners against us			2
‘ we were still in the game with @entity14 at half - time , we scored an own goal in the second half and then they made it three			2
but we were in it			0
‘ @entity13 beat us 5 - 1 and really dominated us			2
from the three of them , including @entity84 , @entity13 have been the most convincing			2
‘ but what i have said , and will say again , is that @entity13 have n’t been to @entity43 yet ! seriously , it ’s ok them beating us 5 - 1 at their place			1
i can make a better assessment after both teams have been to us			0
‘ i would like to assess the two of them properly after they ’ve been to @entity43 , because we know it ’s a difficult place for away teams			2
@entity236 celebrates one of his side 's goals during their 5 - 1 win against @entity241 ‘ if they are as convincing as they were in the second half at @entity34 , then i would say @entity13 are definitely the top team			1
‘ the wee boy @entity242 came off the bench for @entity13 in the second half against us			2
off the bench ! and he scored two against us			0
’ arguments over who is the better side at least have the potential to be settled – if only temporarily – at a stroke tomorrow			2
as for what the result means to the title race , well , there is a strong argument to say that @entity14 , having lost at home to @entity13 early in the season , ca n’t afford to surrender more ground to their rivals			1
‘ i look at this championship and say it ’s like when @entity14 and @entity261 were in the @entity262 , ’ said @entity38			1
‘ if the two of them were there , one of them was always going to win it			0
‘ that ’s why the big emphasis was on the results between them			0
ok , they would drop points during the season to the like of @entity271 and @entity272 , both teams did that , but the title would be settled on the results between each other			0
‘ now , @entity13 have already beaten @entity14			1
and they ’ve beaten them at @entity165			0
does that mean they ’ll go on to win the league ? ‘ i think it ’s going to be between the two of them , which means the results between the sides will be vital			0
‘ that makes this weekend really important , especially if @entity14 go nine points behind			2
that ’s a lot to catch up			0
‘ it ’s definitely @entity10 ’s game of the day , no doubt			0
that was going to happen this season , was n’t it ? it ’ll be great			0

@entity13 and @entity14 face each other in the on saturday
they occupy the top two spots in the @entity28
@entity43 boss @entity38 believes @entity13 are the better side
