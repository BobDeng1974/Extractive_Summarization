the @entity0 sparked fury today after launching an unprecedented inquiry into @entity4 ’s treatment of the disabled			1
the @entity6 launched a formal probe into whether this country has committed ‘ grave or systemic violations ’ of the rights of disabled people			1
@entity13 @entity12 tonight branded the investigation ‘ politically motivated ’ and said @entity4 ’s record on help for disabled people was among the best in the world			1
its members include @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35			0
the investigation is the latest in a series of interventions into @entity4 domestic policy by the @entity0 , which have provoked fury among ministers			1
earlier this year a group of @entity0 poverty ‘ ambassadors ’ attacked @entity46 welfare reforms , and last year the @entity0 ’s controversial @entity51 housing ‘ rapporteur ’ @entity47 , a former @entity48 dubbed the ‘ @entity49 ’ , criticised cuts to housing benefit			1
@entity13 mp @entity55 said : ‘ this politically motivated loony left decision brings the @entity0 organisation in to disrepute			1
‘ at a time when there are grave international crises around the world and when in dozens of countries around the world there are no benefits available , this absurd decision is made to attack our country which rightly does more than almost any other to protect the rights of disadvantaged people from all walks of life			2
’ @entity51 @entity0 poverty ambassador @entity47 criticised the @entity4 government 's ' bedroom tax ' earlier this year - sparking anger among @entity13 mps fellow conservative @entity79 said : ‘ these people at the @entity0 are idiots , frankly			1
there ’s no other way to describe them			0
‘ this country has led the way in the support and rights that we give to disabled people – such as through the @entity89 which was passed by a @entity13 government in 1995			1
‘ if the @entity0 drew up a list of countries in the world showing how much they gave to disabled people they would find the @entity4 was the highest in the world			1
‘ they are exposing the @entity0 for the completely useless organisation that it is			2
’ the investigation is officially confidential , but a former member of the committee confirmed its existence in a video posted on the internet			0
professor @entity104 told a conference in @entity106 , @entity107 : ‘ where the issue has been raised and the government did not really make effective actions to fix the situation … it is a very high threshold thing , the violations should be grave and very systemic			2
’ the existence of the inquiry , which was reported by @entity115			0
the committee did not respond to requests by the @entity118 for comment , but @entity120 , the committee ’s secretary , told @entity115 : ‘ inquiry proceedings … of the @entity123 to the @entity0 @entity124 , are confidential			0
’ miss @entity47 sparked a furious reaction from work and pensions secretary @entity22 after she criticised the so - called ‘ @entity126 ’			0
she also signed a letter from a group of poverty ‘ ambassadors ’ criticising other welfare reforms designed to cut @entity4 ’s huge benefits bill and encourage unemployed people back in to work			1
another @entity0 inspector , @entity136 feminist academic @entity135 , was crticised after she claimed @entity4 had a culture of sexism worse than any other country in the world			2
the @entity141 also refused to comment on the inquiry , but pointed out the @entity4 spends around £ 50billion a year on disabled people			1
a spokesman said : ‘ all @entity0 inquiry processes are confidential			0
must ' this government is committed to supporting disabled people and we continue to spend around £ 50bn a year on disabled people and their services			2
’ for those aged between 16 and 64 , the disability living allowance ( @entity151 ) - benefits given to disabled people to help them with daily activities and moving around - has now been replaced by the personal independence payment ( @entity156 )			2
unlike the previous payment , @entity156 includes a face - to - face consultation with a heath worker to assess people 's ability at tasks such as washing and cooking , before scoring their abilities on a chart			0
this chart is then used to work out how much money they can receive , and regular check - ups are scheduled to ensure this is kept at the right level			0
in 2012 , there were over 3 million @entity151 claimants in the @entity4 , but the government estimates 600,000 fewer disabled people will qualify for @entity156 by 2018			1
the @entity177 was also introduced for those claiming @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 on the grounds of illness or disability			0
this meant that almost two million people were assessed by health workers to see what sort of jobs they could perform and whether they were fit to work			0
those ruled unfit for work were then moved on to the new @entity191 and were given another exam , again using a points - based system , to decide how much support they qualified for .			0

@entity0 @entity6 has opened probe
will check if there has been ' grave violations ' of rights of disabled people
mps tonight branded the investigation ' politically motivated '
