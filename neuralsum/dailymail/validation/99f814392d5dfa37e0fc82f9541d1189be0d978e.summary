sir @entity0 , nicknamed ' sir @entity1 ' has overseen a move that will ban civil servants from speaking to journalists without prior approval a ban on civil servants talking to journalists without prior ministerial approval will ‘ intimidate ’ them into silence , critics said last night			1
the @entity13 has been revised , with the threat that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister			0
a line has been added to the code , saying : ‘ ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media			1
’ as well as raising concerns about the transparency of government , there are fears the revision could dissuade whistleblowers from coming forward – meaning scandals could go undetected			0
the move , which follows a similar clampdown on members of the armed forces talking to the media , has been overseen by cabinet secretary sir @entity0 , the @entity36			1
he has been nicknamed ‘ sir @entity1 ’ for preventing the @entity38 inquiry into the @entity39 from seeing letters and records of phone calls between @entity43 and @entity44			1
his influence is such that @entity46 is said to have once joked : ‘ remind me , @entity0 , do you work for me or do i work for you ? ’ a source at the @entity50 – which is in charge of the @entity52 – insisted the move was an attempt to increase ministers ’ accountability of civil servants in their department			1
@entity59 , cabinet office minister , promised to ensure that the right of whistleblowers would be maintained			0
but @entity62 of the @entity64 union , which represents @entity66 officials , said the move was an ‘ unnecessary , unworkable and unjustified restriction ’			0
‘ the public has a right to open and transparent public services , yet this change now requires ministerial authorisation before a civil servant can respond or make any contact with the media – from a prosecutor being asked for comment outside of court , to a job centre manager dealing with a local news story , ’ he added			1
‘ guidance to regulate contact between civil servants and the media is already in place and we can see no justification for this sudden , drastic change , other than intimidating civil servants into silence … this knee - jerk decision seems to have only been made to sate unfounded and misguided ministerial mistrust			2
’ @entity94 , of the @entity95 , said the ban was an attempt to ‘ prevent public servants from telling the truth about government policy , by a minister who has already admitted he wants to do as much damage as possible before he steps down by making his reforms “ irreversible ” ’			0
@entity59 , cabinet office minister , promised that the right of whistleblowers would be maintained the extension to the @entity13 means the government has effectively ordered more than 400,000 people not to talk to reporters without its approval			2
a spokesman for the @entity50 said the rule ‘ clarifies ’ an existing requirement that civil servants must ‘ clear material for publication in advance ’			2
he added : ‘ there is no change to the important rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation which is protected by statute			0
’ in a letter to the @entity64 union , mr @entity59 said he proposes to include ‘ a footnote referencing the whistleblowing legislation within the revised code ’ .			0

critics warned this will ' intimidate ' them into silence and is ' unnecessary '
line added to @entity13 says must have ' ministerial authorisation '
move was overseen by sir @entity0 , @entity142
