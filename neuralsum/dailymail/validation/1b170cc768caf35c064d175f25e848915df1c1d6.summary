and police and security services ? we 've not had any answers yet			0
' mr @entity25 pointed the finger at intelligence services for failing to discover who was ' radicalising our children ' , and claimed he and his wife had simply given their daughter freedoms afforded in any ' normal ' family			1
he also criticised @entity50 police for not doing more to ' save our daughter ' when she initially made the journey			0
his comments come after the families of the three @entity5 schoolgirls appeared before appeared before the @entity192 home affairs committee this week			1
and the country ’s top police officer was forced to apologise to their families over a misplaced letter relating to a fourth girl ’s disappearance , who was identified this week as @entity122			0
the report will air on @entity12 at 6.30pm and ten and can be found online at itv.com / news @entity208 's cousin @entity207 ( left ) , @entity17 's sister @entity204 ( centre ) and @entity19 's father @entity206 ( right ) , appeared before the @entity192 home affairs committee this week @entity16 student @entity17 , 15 , sent an open message to @entity7 , 20 , who had fled to @entity6 from @entity9 to be a ' jihadi bride ' in 2013 , asking her to open a private line of communication			1

the family 's statement in full : ' the family of @entity7 are full of horror and anger that their daughter may have had a role to play in the recruitment of these young girls to @entity246			1
they are not sure how much more misery that @entity129 can inflict on her own family but the fact that she is now accused of destroying other families is beyond the pale			2
however the @entity254 have serious questions to answer - @entity129 's social media has been monitored since she disappeared over a year ago , yet despite alleged contact between the girls and @entity129 , they failed to stop them from leaving the @entity50 to @entity104 a staging post for @entity6			1
sadly despite all the government 's rhetoric on @entity246 , if they ca n't even take basic steps to stop children leaving to join @entity246 , what is the point of any new laws ? as for @entity129 - you are a disgrace to your family and the people of @entity2 , your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of @entity273			2
you are killing your family every day with your actions , they are begging you stop if you ever loved them			0

@entity7 left @entity9 in november 2013 and married an @entity278 militant
20 - year - old is believed to have lured three @entity5 schoolgirls to @entity6
but her father @entity283 says she contacted family to deny any involvement
