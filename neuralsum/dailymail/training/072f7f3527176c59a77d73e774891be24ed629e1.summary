by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 21 january 2013 trauma : @entity2 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , woke up during an operation but could not communicate with the surgeons to let them know a mother has described the agony of feeling a surgeon cutting into her stomach when she woke up during an operation			1
@entity2 lay paralysed on the operating table as she listened to doctors speaking above her and felt every incision they made			1
unable to move or scream , she resorted to counting each stitch and staple that was used to sew her wounds while she waited for the ordeal to end			0
the 32 - year - old spent 40 minutes trapped within her body , awake due to misjudged anaesthetic but paralysed by muscle relaxants , as unwitting doctors continued to operate			1
when the medication finally wore off , 20 minutes after the operation had finished , she was so traumatised that she became hysterical			0
@entity26 in @entity26 has paid miss @entity2 £ 30,000 in compensation after admitting a doctor ‘ switched off the anaesthetic too early ’			1
while the operation took place more than a year and a half ago , it has taken miss @entity2 until now to build up the courage to speak about her ordeal			1
the mother - of - two was diagnosed in 2004 with inter-cranial hypertension , a brain condition which causes severe headaches and could lead to blindness			2
while she takes medication daily , doctors suggested she should have an operation to drain fluid from her brain to her stomach , which was completed in september 2010			1
she was then booked in for another four - hour procedure on her spine and stomach in april 2011 in the hope it would further relieve the pressure on her brain			1
the last thing miss @entity2 remembers is having a tube fitted in her hand and then ‘ going black ’ , before becoming aware of the most excruciating pain			1
‘ there are no words to describe what it felt like , ’ she said			1
‘ i could feel them cutting across			2
it was them cutting my stomach open			2
i was unsure whether i was dreaming			0
the mother - of - two was diagnosed in 2004 with inter-cranial hypertension , a brain condition which causes severe headaches and could lead to blindness			2
pictured above , before she was ill ‘ i could hear them talking but i could n’t move at all			2
i was trying to scream			0
' i tried to wiggle my toes desperately hard but i could n’t move anything			0
i tried to raise my heartbeat to make them notice but they could n’t notice			0
i could n’t blink or anything			0
‘ the feeling of being trapped was worse than the pain			2
i have never experienced pure panic like it ever before			0
i really believed i was going to die			0
it felt as if i was being tortured but was powerless to stop it			0
’ eventually , miss @entity2 remembered that the stages of her operation had been explained to her by doctors before surgery , with the stomach being opened last , so she recognised they were towards the end of the procedure			1
‘ the only thing i could do was concentrate on what they were physically doing , ’ she said			1
‘ i just had to get to the end of it			2
i could feel every stitch going in			0
i counted all the stitches			0
it ’s infinite counting now in my nightmares			0
@entity26 in @entity26 ( above ) has paid miss @entity2 £ 30,000 in compensation after admitting a doctor ' switched off the anaesthetic too early ' ‘ and then the staples afterwards			1
i was able to tell them afterwards exactly how many they had done			0
’ in total , miss @entity2 remembers 40 minutes of surgery , although it felt ‘ like hours ’			1
in recovery , she screamed uncontrollably			0
a nurse ran to get the anaesthetist and miss @entity2 was able to recount to him the conversations he had been having during surgery			1
‘ the first thing i said was : “ i was awake			1
he kept saying : “ i ’m sorry , i should n’t have done it			0
” miss @entity2 ’s consultant anaesthetist had decided that day to change his usual routine , which he had used treating more than 1,000 previous patients			1
he decided to switch off the anaesthetic before surgery was finished so that miss @entity2 might become alert faster after the operation			1
he immediately accepted his error and while he kept his job , the hospital never contested miss @entity2 ’s complaint			2
the doctor was said to feel ‘ deep regret ’ over what happened			1
soon after the operation , miss @entity2 was diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress , suffering from anxiety attacks and becoming so agoraphobic that she did not leave the house for six months			2
she had to have four more urgent operations but refused to go to hospital , so was taken in by ambulance and given gas			0
she will not be given further surgery because she is not emotionally strong enough			0
miss @entity2 , from @entity3 in @entity4 , now takes morphine every day and has only recently built up the courage to start leaving her home			2
she is particularly upset that her children , @entity137 , eight , and @entity138 , five , have also suffered , adding : ‘ i ’m still angry – with the hospital , with the anaesthetist			0
i want them to face what happened			0
’ @entity143 , of @entity26 and @entity144 , said : ‘ on behalf of the trust i apologise profusely to miss @entity2 for her pain and distress			1
