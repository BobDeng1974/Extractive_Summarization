a shameless prisoner has sparked outrage after smuggling a phone in to jail and posing for a selfie which he then uploaded on to @entity6			1
@entity7 took the picture with another inmate , who was also snapped staring down the camera in @entity11 in @entity12			1
the 29 - year - old then posted it on @entity6 with the caption : ' selfie in my cellfie haha get on it			1
' a friend asked him to send him his number and asked if he had credit , referring to him as a # legend			1
@entity7 is currently serving time following a recall for prison , in which he breached the conditions of his licence			2
his original offence was for attempted grievous bodily harm			2
@entity7 ( left ) , with another inmate , in the snap he put on @entity6 with the caption ' selfie in my cellfie ' a @entity37 spokesman said an investigation was ongoing and could not give a comment about the prisoner			1
she said : ' we have made clear that it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites or instruct others to do so on their behalf			0
' no prisoner should be in any doubt that if they break the rules they will be stripped of their privileges and may be reported to the police for further action			2
' we have an agreement with @entity6 to close down accounts being updated by or on behalf of serving prisoners			2
' @entity7 is currently serving time in @entity11 prison , near @entity59 in @entity12 , following a recall for prison , in which he breached the conditions of his licence			1
his original offence was for attempted grievous bodily harm the prison holds 1,100 prisoners - use of a mobile behind bars is punishable with up to two more years inside the selfie comes in the wake of new legislation proposed in @entity72 to cut prisoners off from their mobile phones			1
phone networks will be forced to block mobile phones and sim cards if they are being used in prison as a suggested amendment to the @entity80			0
it is hoped the new legislation will take advantage of cutting - edge detection equipment to allow prisons to identify unauthorised phones			0
prison guards seize around 130 mobiles every week which are frequently used to run rackets inside from drug smuggling to contract killings or to harass their former victims or witnesses , use of a mobile behind bars is already punishable with a sentence of up to two more years in jail and an unlimited fine , but around 7,000 criminals still use them inside			1
the most recent figures available show that a total of 7,451 illicit mobile phones were seized in prisons in @entity105 and @entity106 in 2013			0
@entity108 , from the @entity107 , told @entity109 : ' there 's nothing unusual about this			0
it 's another example of prisoners abusing the system			0
' i think the @entity117 have shown some form of action but it has not been done quick enough			0
it is too little too late			0
' the only thing they can do is to put blockers on mobile phones in prisons			0
' what the @entity117 should do now is to fine the prisoner who has posted this selfie and give him an additional prison sentence to send a message out			1
' as far as i 'm aware , that has never been used yet but they should now prosecute to show it is being taken seriously			0
