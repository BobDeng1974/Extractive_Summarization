change of opinion : @entity1 once claimed that climate change would kill billions , but the environmentalist now says green movement theories are meaningless drivel he was once a guru to environmentalists , claiming climate change would kill billions of humans by the end of this century			1
but it seems @entity1 has had a change of heart			1
on the eve of a major environmental summit , he has attacked the modern green movement – declaring its theories ' meaningless drivel '			1
almost half a century after he revealed his @entity20 theory , which inspired a generation of activists , the former @entity18 scientists said he believed that rising sea levels were not a problem and that wind turbines were ' useless '			1
the 92 - year - old described the modern green movement as a ' religion ' , which used guilt to gain support			1
speaking about climate change , he said : ' i 'm not worried about sea - level rises			1
' he added : ' at worst , i think it will be 2ft a century			2
' slamming environmentalists , he said : ' it just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the @entity38 religion			2
' i do n't think people have noticed that , but it 's got all the sort of terms that religions use			2
you ca n't win people round by saying they are guilty for putting co2 in the air			2
' mr @entity1 said he was a firm supporter of nuclear power and even voiced his support for fracking – the controversial process of extracting gas from rock deep underground , opposed by the green movement			2
he said : ' gas is almost a giveaway in the @entity60 at the moment			2
they 've gone for fracking in a big way			2
' let 's be pragmatic and sensible and get @entity65 to switch everything to methane			0
we should be going mad on it			0
' in an interview , mr @entity1 described existing theories of ' sustainable development ' – a key topic for discussion at the upcoming summit – as ' drivel '			0
he suggested that humans should instead use air conditioning to deal with climate change in cities , citing @entity81 as an example			1
he said : ' if we all move into cities , they become the equivalent of a nest			0
then another thought comes immediately from that : if that 's the way the flow is going , do n't stop it , let 's encourage it			0
' instead of trying to save the planet by geo - engineering or whatever , you merely have to air - condition the cities			0
' speaking about @entity81 he said : ' you could not have chosen a worse climate in which to build a city			1
it 's a swamp with temperatures in the 90s every day , and very humid			0
turnaround : almost half a century after he revealed his @entity20 theory , which inspired a generation of activists , the former @entity18 scientists said he believed that rising sea levels were not a problem and that wind turbines were ' useless ' ' but it is one of the most successful cities in the world			1
it 's so much cheaper to air - condition the cities and let @entity20 take care of the world			0
it 's a much better route to go than so - called “ sustainable development ” , which is meaningless drivel			0
mr @entity1 , who has conducted research at @entity121 and @entity122 universities , has been a respected member of the academic community for decades			0
he discovered the presence of harmful chemicals – cfcs – in the atmosphere in the 1960s			0
he developed the @entity20 theory while working with @entity18			1
it claims that the @entity131 has a self - regulating system which has automatically controlled global temperature , atmospheric content , oxygen , ocean salinity , and other factors			0
but last month , the scientist admitted that he had been ' alarmist ' and ' extrapolated too far ' with his doomsday - like predictions on the effects of climate change			1
his latest comments came just a week before the @entity143 , a major conference on climate change , to mark the anniversary of the landmark @entity148 in 1992			1
new theory : mr @entity1 said he was a firm supporter of nuclear power and even voiced his support for fracking ¿ the controversial process of extracting gas from rock deep underground , opposed by the green movement			0

former @entity18 scientist said wind turbines were ' useless '
