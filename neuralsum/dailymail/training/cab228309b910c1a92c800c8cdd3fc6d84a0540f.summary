price comparison website trivago.co.uk , which recorded the figures , confirmed that a surge in bookings is normally seen at the same time each year as families and students rush to plan a last - minute summer break			1
but the significant drop in interest this year could be due to families being put off by @entity5 's diminishing reputation , according to trivago			1
