by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 09:55 est , 20 june 2013 this bunny dressed as a sailor may look like an advert for a cartoon but it was in fact part of a serious medical campaign - against sexual transmitted diseases			1
many of these vintage posters come across as crude , sexist and even threatening			1
however , in an age without tv and internet they were the first line of defence against diseases like tuberculosis and gonorrhoea			2
this poster featuring a rabbit dressed as a sailor was issued in 1946 by the @entity25 government to warn navy personnel against unprotected sex			2
the ' pro ' sign is thought to refer to prophylactics a grotesque line - up of dictators @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 carrying hypodermic needles was used to alarm soldiers over the possibility of catching venereal disease during the @entity39 the threat of the ' @entity42 ' powers of @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 during the @entity39 was equated with venereal disease in 1940 as the @entity47 believed it would make their soldiers too weak to fight aimed at soldiers returning from the @entity53 , keeping venereal disease under control was the next big challenge facing the government the @entity57 government warned its soldiers that ' innocent looks ' may be ' booby traps ' the collection , which come from across the world , often used sultry women to flag the dangers of venereal diseases and the @entity67 to symbolise serious ailments			1
the devastating effects of polio on children , for example , was represented by @entity73 holding a little girl 's legs			0
the majority of the campaigns come from the early 1900s when infectious diseases like cholera , influenza and tuberculosis were the great scourges of society			2
governments during the @entity39 feared their soldiers would succumb to sexually transmitted diseases as they played away from home health posters often featuring sultry women in provocative poses , such as this one published in 1943 by the @entity25 government there were also two world wars which caused massive upheaval and resulted in unsanitary conditions where disease flourished			1
soldiers on the frontline were often the focus of these campaigns			2
one @entity53 poster depicts trench foot as being as much a danger as the enemy troops in the opposing trenches			0
the @entity25 government was frightened that all the socialising between locals and soldiers would create an epidemic the @entity57 government also frightened its citizens with the list of symptoms of venereal disease , including sterility and blindness the @entity118 @entity117 was fearful in 1930 of syphilis , telling the public : defend yourself against syphilis cholera is a deadly bacteria , causing death from dehydration , so this @entity128 poster from 1967 urged citizens to get themselves vaccinated before the grim reaper struck a frightening campaign from 1943 , showed death holding a girl 's legs was intended to raise awareness of @entity136 , or infantile paralysis			1
polio epidemics in the early 20th century left thousands paralysed until vaccines were developed in the 1950s and 1960s venereal disease was also a major concern and during the @entity53 an estimated 18,000 @entity25 soldiers were treated for sex diseases every day			1
only the great influenza pandemic of 1918 - 19 accounted for more soldiers taken out of the front line			0
so in the early days of the @entity39 , the @entity25 @entity148 embarked on a massive propaganda campaign			0
this trench foot warning for @entity25 soldiers in the @entity39 was a reaction to the drastic problems from the @entity53 in which affected feet would have to be amputated if untreated a stern warning to ' obey the rules of health ' between 1936 and 1941to avoid @entity157 , which could be avoided with a proper diet and adequate sleep and sunshine exposure this poster appeared in the @entity25 in 1918 appealing for help for @entity163			0
the country had been devastated by the @entity53 , leaving ideal conditions for a cholera epidemic			0
this health warning poster used between 1941 and 1945 issued by the @entity25 government 's @entity168 was particularly graphic this poster was used from 1941 to 1944 as part of the @entity25 war effort			0
although discovered in 1928 in the @entity174 , penicillin was not mass - produced until 1944 , when the @entity25 produced 2.3 million doses in time for the @entity177 invasion it was principally aimed at preventing @entity179 among its millions of male soldiers			0
this resulted in a series of bizarre health posters often featuring sultry women in provocative poses accompanied by phrases such as ' she may look clean - but ... ' however , this ' golden age ' of medical posters soon came to an end with the development of antibiotics and vaccines which made infectious diseases more controllable .			1

governments *desperate* to stop the *spread* of contagious diseases used alarming posters to drive their *message* home
men often warned to *beware* *seductive* women who may carry diseases
@entity57 government warned soldiers ' innocent looks ' may be ' booby traps '
