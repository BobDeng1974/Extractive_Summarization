four in 10 voters think @entity1 poses a ’ danger to @entity3 ’ after he heaped praise on @entity6 president @entity5 , an exclusive poll for @entity8 reveals today			1
the survey reveals the @entity11 leader is also seen as ’ a bit sleazy ’ while his @entity14 rival @entity13 is out of his depth and less likely to tell the truth			1
the @entity18 poll comes as the two men prepare to go head - to - head tomorrow night in the second live tv debate on @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity23			1
after the two men clashed in the first debate last week , a snap poll suggested mr @entity1 won by a margin of 2 - 1			1
ahead of the @entity33 debate tomorrow night , pollsters @entity18 asked voters to consider several statements and say whether they applied more to mr @entity1 or mr @entity13			1
the results reveal weaknesses in both camps			0
in the poll , 38 per cent of people said mr @entity1 ’ is a danger to @entity3 ’ , compared to just 23 per cent who said the same of mr @entity13			1
despite @entity11 drawing much of its support from older voters , 44 per cent of people aged 55 - 64 said mr @entity1 posed a threat to the @entity3			1
half of people working in the public sector , and 44 per cent of people in @entity51 and the @entity52 also agreed mr @entity1 was a danger to the country			0
@entity11 leader @entity1 came out top in a snap poll after his first tv debate on the @entity23 with @entity14 @entity13 last week mr @entity1 has faced criticism for his recent claims that he ’ admires ’ @entity6 president @entity59 , and said claiming the @entity23 was to blame for deaths on the streets of @entity62			1
defending the comments yesterday , mr @entity1 insisted : ’ i said i do n't like him , i would n't trust him , would n't want to live in his country			0
’ but compared with the kids who run foreign policy in this country i have got more respect for him than our lot			0
’ asked in the @entity75 interview which current world leader he admired most , mr @entity1 replied : ’ as an operator , but not as a human being , i would say @entity5			1
the way he played the whole @entity80 thing			0
’ he was also accused of being ' extreme ' by mr @entity13 after claiming the @entity23 has ' blood on its hands ' over the conflict in @entity85			1
both leaders had hoped that their appearance in the tv debates would make them appear more statesmanlike			0
but after their first encounter on @entity91 and @entity92 , only 18 per cent of voters thought either of them would make a good prime minister			2
it is particularly galling for mr @entity13 who has spent four years at the heart of the coalition government			0
last week ’s debate was dominated by rows over the use of statistics , with mr @entity1 claiming 75 per cent of @entity3 ’s laws come from @entity103 and mr @entity13 insisting the figure was more like 7 per cent			1
however , just 18 per cent of people said mr @entity13 ' tells the truth ’ while 25 per cent said the same of mr @entity1			1
damningly , just 8 per cent of voters in @entity108 think mr @entity13 tells the truth			1

just 23 per cent of people said mr @entity13 knew what he is talking about			0
@entity123 , head of political polling at @entity18 , said : ' while there is little good news for either leader here , @entity13 should be the more worried			1
' after nearly four years as deputy prime minister he has failed to convince the @entity3 public he is more @entity131 than a leader of a party with no mps			0
however there is also a warning for @entity1 that many see him as a danger to @entity3			0
' one of the most striking difference came when voters were asked which of the two leaders they most considered to be ’ a bit sleazy ’			0
overall , 40 per cent named mr @entity1 , double the 21 per cent who named mr @entity13			2
half of people in the public sector and the better off ( @entity147 social grade ) said mr @entity1 was sleazy			0
however mr @entity1 ’s fortunes were reversed when the survey asked which of the two leaders is ’ out of his depth ’			1
some 42 per cent named mr @entity13 , to just 26 per cent who lambasted mr @entity1			2
much of mr @entity1 ’s appeal has been based on his apparently insatiable appetite for a drink in a pub. as he left last week ’s debate he was asked if he was going to the pub , and he replied : ’ well i ’m not going to church			2
’ complaining about the three - day window before postal votes were sent out in a by - election campaign last month , he said : ’ i have been in benders for longer than the opening of the nominations and the start of postal ballots			0
’ overall , a third ( 33 per cent ) of people said they thought mr @entity1 would be good to have a pint with			2
among men the figure rose to 44 per cent , falling to just 22 per cent among women			0
mr @entity13 was marginally more of a hit with the ladies - 14 per cent of female voters wanted a pint with him , over 13 per cent of men			2
however , fewer than one in 10 housewives and househusband would venture out for a pint with mr @entity13			0
similarly 13 per cent of women thought mr @entity13 would ' make a good date ' , compared to just 8 per cent for mr @entity1			1
however , mr @entity1 was a more popular choice for a date among men - 12 per cent to mr @entity13 ’s 10			1
on several measures there was little to divide the two men			0
just over a third said both men were ' annoying ' - 35 per cent for mr @entity13 and 34 per cent for mr @entity1			2
older people and people in the @entity193 were more likely to find mr @entity13 annoying , while mr @entity1 irritated the better - off , people with a private pension and @entity51 .			2
