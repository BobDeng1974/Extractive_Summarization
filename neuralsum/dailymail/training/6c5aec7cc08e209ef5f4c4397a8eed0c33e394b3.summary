by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 03:33 est , 12 december 2012 the police are n't renowned for their sense of humour , but someone at @entity5 clearly had an attack of the funnies this morning when they took to @entity8			1
in an effort to warn motorists of the icy conditions , a flurry of tweets from the station 's official @entity8 feed , were sent out in the style of rap star @entity18 's 1990 hit ' @entity19 '			1
the first tweet , sent out around 7am this morning read : ' @entity21			0
alright stop , collaborate and listen , @entity22 is back and these roads are glistening			0
' the police giving a rap on @entity8 , not the knuckles : @entity5 shows it has n't lost its cool by rapping about road safety ice cool : @entity18 displays awards he won at @entity30 in @entity31 in 1991 shortly followed by : ' slowly , cuz the streets are freezin ' , do n't forget to clear off the windscreen			1
' and finally : ' if ice is a problem , yo , you can solve it , check out this link while my @entity38 revolves it			0
' the link referred to in the final tweet sent readers through to a @entity43 website , offering advice on driving in wintery conditions			0
the image on the website is of a mangled car , leading some on @entity8 to take offence at the police 's lighthearted approach to a serious matter			2
@entity5 defended its decision to treat a serious matter with a touch of humour			1
a police spokesman said : ' the # @entity59 tweets were a light - hearted way of getting across a serious message about road safety during the cold weather this morning and we hope it raised a smile amongst our followers			1
' we 've had more than 2,000 re-tweets so far and if it gets more people thinking about how they drive in icy conditions then that 's a great result			2
' certain followers of the police 's twitter feed were n't convinced however			2
@entity76 tweeted : ' mixed feelings about the use of @entity5 's official twitter feed			1
appropriateness : ummm ' others criticised @entity5 for being out of touch in the choosing of a song that is 22 years out of date			1
not so funny : the link following the rap - style weather warnings led readers to this page on road safety			2
some @entity8 users felt the picture of the mangled wreck sat awkwardly alongside the jokey police tweets # unsure : @entity76 expressed uncertainty about the @entity5 's use of humour when advising drivers how to stay safe on the roads one said : ' this was a hit 22 years ago , so why the police think it 's relevant to @entity8 users today shows they are a bit out of touch '			1
the general consensus on @entity8 , however , was positive , with tweets congratulating @entity5 on its novel approach to policing			1
one user referred to the use of police humour to broadcast a serious message as ' genius ' , while another said it ' casts the police in a new light '			2
# youfunnylot : three of many tweets congratulating @entity5 on their use of humour to broadcast their road safety message sadly , not all of the country 's police forces are so tolerant of their officers showing their funny side on @entity8			1
popular police officer @entity130 , 38 , from @entity131 , was stopped from using his force 's social networking account this week after being accused of posting too many humourous and bizarre comments			0
after being given responsibilty to write his messages on the social networking site , dubbed ' @entity139 ' , to encourage more locals to report crime , his bosses intervened when he started to stray beyond the realms of policing			0
among his random postings were song lyrics , commentary on the @entity147 and gags about former pop stars			0
the officer also used the account to highlight the inflated price of confectionery alongside the hashtag Â£ crimeupdate , including posts saying ' @entity156 78p ! ! ? maltesers 80p ! ! ! ' @entity157 would give regular weather reports and affectionately referred to his beat of @entity161 , near @entity162 , @entity163 , as ' @entity164 ' community outreach : @entity157 's tweets often featured song recommendations and weather updates despite followers referring to him as ' a legend ' and his random tweets as ' brilliant ' , he was relieved of the duty when he inadvertently posted a lighthearted tweet just hours after a fatal police pursuit in @entity177			1
@entity178 , 22 , and @entity179 , 23 , died after their @entity180 crashed as they were fleeing a police patrol on sunday morning			0
later that day , the message ' i will find			0
i will hunt you down ' was posted on the @entity161 account			0
the message , however , was in response to another @entity8 user and unrelated to the tragedy			0
senior officers are thought to have spoken to @entity157 and he agreed to hand over his tweeting duties to colleague .			0
