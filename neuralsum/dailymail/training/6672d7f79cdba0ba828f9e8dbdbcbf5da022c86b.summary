it may have been touted as the steamiest thing in @entity2 - but movie critics rounded on @entity4 for being too light on the sex			1
in a barrage of reviews published on tuesday night , most of those who sat down with the raunchy adaptation ahead of its 13 february release date lamented its ' run - of - the - mill ' lovemaking			1
one critic pointed out that sex only makes up 15 minutes of the two - hour runtime			1
another pointed out that there are no visible genitals , no orgasms - and not that much nudity			1
writing in @entity42 , critic @entity41 said bluntly : ' those looking for hot , kinky sex will be disappointed			2
fewer than 15 of the movie 's 125 minutes feature sex scenes			1
' discussion of contracts and objections over line items outweigh erotica			2
even the graphic nudity grows numbing			2
' in @entity53 , freelance critic @entity52 particularly noted @entity55 's lack of on - screen exposure			2
' nobody in the movie has visible genitals ' , she said			2
' @entity60 in particular seems to do a whole lot of stuff in the playroom with his shirt off but his pants on , which can not be comfortable for such an active young man			1
' but even more frustrating to voyeurs , nobody sweats , nobody strains , nobody loses control or even fakes losing control by simulating an orgasm			2
' more sweat , please : writers seemed put out that the levels of nudity and sexual interaction on - screen did not match the steamy books by @entity40 and , while the trappings and devices of kinky sex do exist in the film , another writer pointed out that they are not put to especially shocking use			1
the @entity88 's @entity87 said : '			2
. anyone hoping the movie would really push the @entity92 envelope may find @entity60 's tastefully shot toy room a little … vanilla			1
' we see a whip here , a handcuff there , but nothing that would shock even newcomers to the series			2
' the @entity102 describe @entity29 's performance as ' adequate , ' and reveal that the highly anticipated sex scenes only really serve to push the plot forward			1
@entity106 says : ' the sex scenes in @entity4 are numerous , lengthy and frank , but they are n’t smutty			0
' only occasionally does it dip into @entity110 - territory			0
by and large , these key scenes really are there to advance the plot , and only the most buttoned - up prude will be scandalised			0
' ' vanilla ' : though whips , handcuffs and other bdsm paraphernalia are present in the film , it was implied they are not made much use of disappointment ? only 15 minutes of the two - hour - plus film are said to be sex @entity124 from @entity125 described the film as medicore : ' just how sexually explicit is “ @entity4 ? ” it ’s mild			1
' sure there ’s plenty of nudity , but more salacious material is shown every day on cable			0
it ’s not even close to late - night @entity134			0
you ’ll find more disturbing images in “ @entity137 ” or “ @entity138			0
” ' the mediocre plot , bland characters and tepid tone do n’t do any favors			0
director @entity143 treats the movie as serious as a cadaver , which is truly a major disappointment			0
' a writer for the @entity147 coyly noted ' there is more scintillating material in a premium @entity151 show '			0
@entity152 said @entity4 was ' run of the mill ' - drawing the comparison with sex - laden cable shows like @entity138 , or @entity156 , which is notoriously graphic and unsentimental when it comes to copulation			1
@entity159 at @entity160 said : ' it 's just kind of an above - average and brooding " love " story , not campy or clumsy enough to be so - bad - it 's - good , not quite stylish or sizzling or steamy enough to overcome its atrocious source material			0
' starting his review of the film by echoing many of the other critics sentiments : ' here 's a criticism of @entity4 you probably were n't expecting : there 's not nearly enough sex in it			1
there was supposed to be a lot more			0
' love story : some critics have praised the romance of the film which sees @entity4 fall for @entity60 however , while critics mainly said the film failed to perform sexually , praise was doled out for the film 's storytelling and dialogue , which was characterized as more subtle and elegant than @entity40 's novels			1
@entity191 @entity193 writer @entity192 said : ' substituting heartache for handcuffs , @entity4 is the rare studio romance in which the characters actually try to understand one another			0
' as this is the first installment of an epic trilogy , how much there is beneath the surface remains to be seen , but @entity143 seems genuinely interested in finding out			0
fifty shades may not make you come , but you ’ll still be glad you went			0
' whilst @entity204 of the @entity205 revealed : ' it ’s a slow build to the smutty bits , and one that ’s disappointingly devoid of tension			0
' even so , the movie is , by definition , a stronger proposition than the book because it strips away the oodles of cringe - inducing descriptions and internal monologue that tip the text heavily toward self - parody			0
' things grow more compelling once @entity4 whips out his nondisclosure agreement – along with a nice @entity222 , naturally – and shows @entity4 his ' playroom ' , expertly outfitted with state - of - the - art @entity92 gear			0
' similarly the @entity225 praised the film for stripping away the fat of the book transforming it into a sleek and watchable movie			2
film critic @entity230 says : ' @entity30 ’s timing and verve are terrific , and manage to upend the more distasteful indignities of the book in gold - spun - from - straw ways			1
' it ’s her rebellion , not just her submission , that this version of @entity60 finds attractive , which gives @entity29 something more interesting , human , and contradictory to play as well			1
' if @entity143 and @entity40 bitterly tussled for control over this material , it 's a relief and even a bit of a thrill that the director came out on top			1

critics said tame feature film , out on february 13 , was ' run of the mill '
one pointed out that lead @entity29 mostly keeps his pants on
bdsm props *deployed* on @entity30 were also termed ' vanilla '
it was often remarked that @entity40 novels were far more explicit
