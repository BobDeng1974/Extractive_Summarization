@entity1 fans may need to wait a little longer to get their hands , or wrists , on the tech giant 's upcoming smartwatch			2
a ' source close to @entity1 ' told @entity7 that the firm ' would be lucky to ship [ the watch ] before @entity10 '			2
@entity1 is said to be unhappy with the watch 's battery life , and the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year			1
@entity1 is said to be unhappy with the watch 's battery life , and the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year and @entity7 also reported that @entity1 partners and employees expected the watch to launch this year			1
@entity1 's chief executive @entity26 unveiled the watch at a launch event earlier this month			1
but despite the range of impressive features unveiled by mr @entity26 , there was something he failed to mention : battery life			1
the telling omission , suggests the watch ’s battery life will be the @entity36 of the device when it sold in early 2015			1
most existing smartwatches on the market , such as @entity40 and @entity41 , tend to last up to a week on a single charge			0
the closest @entity26 came to talking about the battery life for the watch was saying that users would ‘ charge it at night			1
’ the watch has a completely new user interface , different from the @entity49 , and the ' crown ' on the @entity19 is a dial called the ' digital crown			2
' users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map , or scroll a list			0
the crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen			0
different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes , and force touches			0
the @entity64 feature shows info users would like to see , similar to @entity66 , and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom			0
music can also be controlled on an @entity49 through the @entity19			0
built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications			0
it understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers , and messages can be dictated to the @entity49			0
users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply , or have it transcribed to them			0
there is no keyboard on the watch , and messages can only be sent through dictation , or emoji			0
@entity91 also is built into the @entity19			0
during an interview in @entity94 , @entity1 's senior vice president of operations @entity92 said : ' we want to make the best product in the world			2
' one of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt , but nobody is wearing them			0
' the company 's chief executive added that the @entity19 ‘ can be worn all day , for any occasion , ’ but hourly figures were notably absent			0
a source said that @entity1 is unhappy with the watch 's battery life , according to @entity109			1
another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘ is about a day now			2
’ @entity1 's chief executive @entity26 ( pictured ) unveiled the watch at a launch event earlier this month			1
although he did n't reveal battery life details , mr @entity26 did spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity1 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging the watch has a completely new user interface ( left ) , different from the @entity49 , and the ' crown ' on the @entity19 is a dial called the ' digital crown ' ( right ) presented by chief executive @entity26 the company 's chief executive added that the @entity19 ‘ can be worn all day , for any occasion , ’ but hourly figures were notably absent			1
the product costs $ 349 ( £ 216 ) and is now not expected to launch until at least february next year a spokesperson for @entity1 declined to provide battery details to @entity131 and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year			1
like many of @entity1 ’s other products , the @entity19 appears to have a sealed back , which means the battery can not be replaced			2
this suggests that the entire $ 349 ( £ 216 ) device will have to be replaced , once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use			1
another concern is the launch of the health and activity - tracking apps on the @entity19 , which will rely on adequate battery life for round - the - clock monitoring			1
built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a vibrations users feel on their wrist			0
it understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers , and messages can be dictated to the @entity49 companies like @entity157 and @entity158 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0
however , if the watch has to be charged at night , vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which @entity1 says will ‘ motivate people to be more active and more healthy			2
’ @entity1 did , however , spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity1 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging			1
the long lead time before the product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released , since app developers have more time to create apps specifically for the watch			1
@entity1 ’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature			1
the success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time .			0

the @entity19 was unveiled at an event in @entity185 earlier this month
