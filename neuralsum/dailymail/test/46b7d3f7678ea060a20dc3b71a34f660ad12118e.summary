a man who has two failed marriages with @entity3 women is hoping it will be third time lucky now that he is engaged to another woman he met in the country that he now calls home			1
@entity9 , 58 , was left devastated after the marriage to his first @entity3 wife broke down shortly after he brought her to the @entity13			1
he then remarried , but his second wife , also from @entity3 , turned out to be a serial bigamist who conned him out of £ 24,000 of his retirement money and left him close to bankruptcy			1
@entity9 with his fiancee @entity21 determined not to let the experiences put him off , @entity9 is now dating a third @entity3 woman and is convinced his latest lady will prove to be third time lucky			1
the former van driver said : ' i know people reading this might think i 'm the most gullible man in @entity13 but i 'm not bothered			2
' i may have been left with nothing from the last @entity3 woman i fell in love with , but my new girlfriend is different			1
' she is wonderful and i feel blessed			0
it may be stupid but i always follow my heart			0
' @entity9 with his last wide @entity35 , who was a bigamist after divorcing his @entity13 wife of seven years in 1992 , the father - of - two never imagined he would find love again			1
with the help of his sons from his first marriage , @entity9 slowly overcame the heartbreak and put his life back together			1
it was n't until 1998 when he visited @entity3 on holiday that he fell in love with @entity47			1
converting to @entity48 and marrying her that year , @entity9 brought his beautiful new wife back to the @entity13 but five years later their marriage ended and the pair divorced			1
@entity9 said : ' @entity47 was too young for me and eventually the cultural differences tore us apart			1
' we split amicably but looking back now , she could have been after me for a @entity13 passport			0
i would never bring another @entity3 woman over to the @entity13 because of that			1
' @entity9 swore off women but 15 years later , everything changed when he joined a friend on another holiday to the @entity65 country			1
just a few days into his stay , @entity9 met @entity35 , then 22 , a waitress who could speak good @entity67			2
@entity35 in the town centre close to her home in @entity3 the pair started talking and after she explained she was recovering from @entity71 and had lost her job in the restaurant , he offered to help			2
@entity9 started sending her £ 50 a week and even paid a cafe owner to give his new love a job , bank rolling her wages of £ 30 a week , unbeknownst to @entity35			1
finally in june 2011 @entity9 had saved up enough money from his job as a van driver to fly back out to @entity3 to be with his love			1
he said : ' i booked another two - week holiday and packed my suitcase full of clothes and jewellery for @entity35			2
' i could n't wait to start our relationship and when i got there and she met me at the airport , it was more than i had ever dreamed of			0
' leaving her to go back to the @entity13 was heart breaking , i was already counting down the days until i could come back and see her			0
' in october 2012 , 16 months later , @entity9 flew out to @entity97 in @entity3 with yet another suitcase of expensive gifts for his girlfriend			1
as well as securing a date for their wedding , @entity9 rented a flat out for her so they would have somewhere to stay whenever he returned to the country			2
in june 2013 , the pair wed at @entity108 in front of @entity35 's sister and uncle - sadly none of @entity9 's family made the trip for the wedding			1
@entity9 with @entity35 , who became pregnant with another man while they were married returning to see his wife as often as he could afford , @entity9 planned to stay living in the @entity13 until he retired from his job as a newspaper delivery driver			1
in february 2014 , @entity35 asked him if he could pay the £ 60 a month lease on a fashion shop she planned to open , which he agreed to do			0
even though she became pregnant with another man 's baby , @entity9 agreed to care for the child as if it were his won on top of this , @entity9 paid £ 2,000 up front on clothes stock and began working overtime to pay for everything			1
but in october 2014 , he received a worrying text message from an unknown number which read : ' your wife has married a @entity3 man , is pregnant by him and living in his family compound in the town of @entity97			1
' @entity9 said : ' i was devastated			2
through tears she admitted she had cheated on me while i was back in @entity142			0
' she said she was now four months pregnant with his @entity143 was heart breaking but at the end of the day , she was my wife			2
i agreed to raise the baby as my own			2
' @entity9 bought maternity clothes and baby bits for @entity150 and in november 2014 he moved to @entity3 to live with his wife , but his happiness was short lived			1
later that month he received another anonymous text saying : ' your wife has three husbands , two white and one black			2
' in the final moments of their relationship , suspicious @entity9 hired a private investigator to unearth the truth about his beloved wife who kept disappearing for weeks on end			1
within 48 hours they had tracked @entity35 down and discovered she was living in a compound with an illegitimate husband and his family			0
@entity9 added : ' words can not explain how distraught i was			2
i could n't believe she would do this to me , after everything i had done for her			0
my trust was completely shattered			0
' in january this year @entity9 contacted the police and @entity35 was arrested and charged with bigamy and fraud			1
@entity9 with @entity35 on the day of their wedding she was fined 15000 @entity178 - ten years ' salary - and will face two years in prison if she fails to pay by the end of april			1
betrayed , @entity9 is now desperate to recover the £ 24,000 he spent on @entity35 over the last four years			2
he said : ' i refuse to divorce her until she pays me back every last penny			0
i have been left with nothing - no home in @entity142 , no pension , no savings , just £ 45 a week to live on			2
' i ca n't even move back to the @entity13 because i ca n't afford it			0
' as they say , love is blind			0
after all those years i finally found love , and it totally backfired			0
' our whole relationship was a lie , and i had no idea			0
the fact that she so willingly took my money as well is just heartless			0
the text @entity9 received telling him that his wife was pregnant with another man 's baby ' looking back now , i should have seen the signs but i was a fool			1
a fair few people tried to warn me but i was having none of it			0
@entity208 does n't even cover it			0
' despite everything he 's been through , @entity9 is now dating @entity21 , 30 , a cafe owner who he met when @entity21 was working in a cafe with @entity35			1
as @entity21 's @entity13 husband had just left her , the pair bonded over their misfortune and although the relationship is still in the early stages , he says marriage ' is n't off the cards			2
' he said : ' she is different to @entity35 and i can only hope it works this time			0
she seems trustworthy and never asks me for anything			0
' she has her own business , home and is beautiful			0
above everything , she makes me laugh and has brought a smile to my face while i 've been dealing with everything			0
' she is very special to me			0
' not bothered by warnings from family and friends , @entity9 is hoping to prove them wrong with his third @entity3 lover			1
he said : ' my loved ones who know what has happened are absolutely disgusted that she would treat me like this			0
' they think i 'm mad for dating another @entity65 lady but at the end of the day , they want me to be happy			0
' although i 'm still angry and full of hatred for @entity35 , i just feel so lucky that i can finally have my happy ending			0
