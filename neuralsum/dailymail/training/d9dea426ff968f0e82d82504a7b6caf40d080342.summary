' on my first day i was told to wait outside a staff member ’s door , as he would want to speak to me , so i waited and leaned against the wall			0
' when the member of staff saw that , he punched me in the stomach and shouted " when i talk to you , you stand to attention "			0
' i refused to apologise and he dragged me in , tore my clothes off and caned me from the back of my neck to the bottom of my feet			2
sir @entity81 , left , and @entity3 , right , were both regular visitors to the children 's home ' they did n’t bring in a doctor			1
everything was in - house , kept in secret within the walls of the home			1
' they would do searches after a visit , where they ’d check you everywhere			0
it made me hate visits from my family			0
it was very invasive - they would check your penis and your bum			2
' they said it was because people could smuggle stuff in , but why did n’t they just search the visitors ? it was just an excuse to touch us			2
' we had what was called ‘ borstal showers ’ , where a man would come in and watch us			2
' one teacher used to take you into the shower - which was like a cattle pen - and turn them on alternatively freezing cold and boiling hot and force you to run all around them , and he would whip you with a very fine stick if you slowed down			0
' i tried to report this , and other things going on			0
there were beatings and we were made to lean against walls , supporting ourselves with our fingertips , for hours at a time			0
' we were made to hold floor buffers - big metal things - in the air for hours			0
it used to kill our hands and arms			0
' victim mr @entity0 spent almost three years at the home , pictured , and claimed he was subject to beatings he said he reported the goings on to a care worker , who came in and set up a case conference with members of staff and members of the governing body , but ' they just started laughing at me '			1
he added : ' i became aware of people being taken from their beds at night			0
they made you feel powerless			0
' there was a flat on the grounds where we were told all the ‘ good boys ’ would go to watch films			0
but they were given something to drink and then they would abuse them			0
' we used to lie in our beds and pretend to be asleep and put our heads under the sheets			0
we did n’t know who they were going to come for			0
you ’d hear the kids being put back into their beds crying their eyes out , sobbing their eyes out			0
it sounds horrible , but you ’d be glad when it was n’t you			0
' we knew of people visiting this flat			2
' we also knew of kids being driven off to a hotel where they would be gang raped			0
that did n’t happen to me , but it was common knowledge			0
i knew it carried on			0
' he said there were youngsters whose parent 's had died in horrific circumstances , and these were targeted more , because officials knew nothing could be done about			1
mr @entity0 , who spent almost three years at the home , said he knew some of the lads ended up as sex workers in @entity222 and @entity223 after being thrown out and ending up on the streets			1

alleged victim : @entity8 accused a senior @entity230 politician from the @entity80 years of being involved in a widespread paedophile ring at the children 's care home he added : ' in the inquiry there were a lot of people we were not allowed to name , all the visitors ( the report focused solely on @entity8 staff and care workers )			1
if you wrote a name they would cross it out			0
' ' if the authorities had looked into the names we supplied during the @entity251 inquiry , there ’s a chance they could have caught more paedophiles			0
links could have been found			0
' and that would have stopped another 12 years of innocent people being abused			2
' earlier this week @entity257 ordered an independent investigation - likely to be led by a judge - into whether an inquiry ignored claims a senior @entity230 was involved in child abuse at the home			1
the prime minister said he would ask an independent figure to review the @entity8 into into abuse at the home in the 1970s and 1980s			1
it follows allegations that a senior unnamed conservative was among those involved in abusing children but were not properly investigate at the time			2
it came after mr @entity274 claimed in an interview with @entity277 ’s @entity276 that he was taken out of @entity8 and ‘ sold ’ to men for sexual abuse at a nearby hotel			1
mr @entity274 said a senior @entity230 from the time - who was not sir @entity81 and who was not named by the programme , had been involved			1
