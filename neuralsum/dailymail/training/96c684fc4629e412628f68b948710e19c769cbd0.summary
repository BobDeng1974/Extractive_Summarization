an ambitious project to put an @entity2 spacecraft on the @entity3 is sputtering on the launchpad as it struggles to secure funding			1
the @entity6 has drawn just £ 8,600 ( $ 13,000 ) of the initial target of £ 99,000 ( $ 150,000 ) with a countdown of only three weeks left before the appeal closes			1
in contrast , a private @entity11 moon project , @entity12 , rode the internet crowdfunding phenomenon to reach its target of nearly a $ 1million ( £ 661,000 ) ahead of deadline last month			1
but countering that view of the continent is one of the underlying aims of the project by the @entity36 , which says it will go ahead even if the initial target is not reached			2
' we get a lot of afro - pessimism , ' chief executive @entity39 told @entity43			0
' anything positive , aspirational or leading edge is treated with scepticism			0
' but i have faith that @entity24 can do this , without a doubt			2
' the @entity6 has drawn just £ 8,600 ( $ 13,000 ) of the initial target of £ 99,000 ( $ 150,000 ) with a countdown of only three weeks left before the appeal closes the non-profit group was co-founded in 2009 by the head of the space lab at the @entity57 , @entity58 , who is also chairman of the @entity60 , the national regulatory body			1
an inspiring @entity11 project to land a spacecraft on the moon in 10 years completed its funding target in december			2
the @entity12 project reached its £ 600,000 ( $ 938,170 ) goal on crowdfunding site @entity68 , with 36 hours to go			2
for £ 60 ( $ 94 ) , backers have the opportunity to buy space on memory discs that will be sent to the moon , and , for an undisclosed price , they are able to send a sample of their dna these discs will act like time capsules for photos , videos and other files , and will be buried in a bore hole drilled into the lunar surface			1
while the discs have raisede money for the mission , its main aim is to analyse the @entity89 and assess its potential for a possible human base to be developed in the future			2
the mission is to see an @entity2 - engineered rocket take an @entity2 - built module to the moon			1
the team behind it want to inspire wider interest in the study of science and technology among young africans while stemming the ' brain - drain ' of highly qualified graduates to the developed world			1
however , the world 's poorest continent recently scored a major international scientific coup with the decision in 2012 to build the bulk of the world 's biggest telescope in @entity24			2
the multi-nation @entity114 telescope ( @entity115 ) will investigate the @entity116 , peek at black holes and uncover new frontiers - possibly even life beyond @entity121 - by peering further into the universe than ever before			0
@entity115 site bid manager @entity123 said the telescope project proved ' there 's definitely the skills and talent out there and a huge amount of interest as well '			0
the @entity6 project ' certainly is feasible , ' he told @entity43			0
' there is the expertise to design , develop and launch such a vehicle			0
' @entity24 is the most developed economy on the continent and under the former apartheid regime had nuclear weapons and a ballistic missile programme , but the foundation is pushing for an all - inclusive @entity2 effort			1
apart from afro - pessimism , a lack of publicity on the project may have contributed to the funding shortfall the appeal for £ 99,000 ( $ 150,000 ) is to cover the first phase , which aims to finalise a feasibility report by the end of november and present it to an international conference			1
only then will it be possible to estimate the full cost of the mission , mr @entity39 said			0
he admits to disappointment , and some puzzlement , over the failure so far of the hoped - for crowdfunding boost for @entity24 's rocket to the moon			1
' the industry and media response has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive , ' mr @entity39 said			0
' the donor response has been slower than we hoped but has picked up dramatically at the start of this year and we are optimistic about our target being reached , if not by the end of the current crowdfunding campaign , then through other funding sources in the first quarter of the year			0
' apart from afro - pessimism , a lack of publicity on the project may have contributed to the funding shortfall			0
some critics have also suggested that the sort of money spent on space exploration could be put to better use on other projects in @entity24 , such as conquering @entity182 and other diseases			1
but the planners argue that investment in education is the best way to take the continent forward			0
mr @entity39 says the @entity2 project is aiming for the moon rather than any other space venture partly because any @entity2 child will be able to step outside , look up and share the pride in a successful mission			1
