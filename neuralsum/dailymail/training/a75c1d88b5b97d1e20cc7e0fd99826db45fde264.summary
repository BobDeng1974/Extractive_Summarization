yesterday actress @entity1 spoke out to defend her real - life ‘ manor ’ – taking aim at wind turbines , oligarchs and a generation of ‘ silver splitters ’			1
she blamed a surge in divorces among baby boomer couples for driving up property prices in the @entity21 , as newly - single women in their 50s and 60s bought up flats and cottages			1
and she lambasted developers who built ‘ vast housing estates ’ in her adopted county of @entity29 , and the super-rich oligarchs who filled its skies with helicopter traffic			0
miss @entity1 , watched by millions in tv shows including @entity37 , gave a wide - ranging interview to @entity39 in which she said parts of @entity29 were under constant threat from developers			1

sorry ? affordable for whom ? it ’s a terribly knotty problem			0
‘ if only we could educate people to go on living together for longer			0
it ’s all these single dwellings , all these women in their 50s and 60s who suddenly want their own space , to be their own people			1
to do what ? ’ figures have shown that divorces among couples of retirement age – dubbed the ‘ silver splitters ’ – have almost doubled in a decade , with the majority instigated by women			2
the phenomenon has been blamed on increased life expectancy , better health and a greater ‘ lust for life ’ among the baby boomers compared with previous generations			2

@entity1 with @entity115 co-star @entity114 she said : ‘ vast housing estates built in the countryside remove the reason why people want to move to the country			1
if you want to embrace a culture , you ca n’t flood it , but it seems they will never build just a few houses in an area			0
’ other threats to the @entity29 countryside included helicopter traffic from the oligarchs who have bought gated mansions in @entity131 and @entity132 , she warned			0
@entity29 is the richest county for property wealth and has become a magnet for @entity136 oligarchs and other ‘ non-doms ’			0
miss @entity1 , a former high sheriff of @entity29 who is involved with several charities and serves as one of the county ’s deputy lieutenants , questioned if the new wealthy residents wanted to be part of the traditional community			1
she said : ‘ everyone thinks you live among all these rich people , but you ca n’t get near any of that money … how do i let them know about battered wives , or my prison charity , or the school in @entity154 ? i do n’t think they want to know			0
’ miss @entity1 continued : ‘ there are wonderful places , such as the @entity157 … but if you ’re vulnerable or on the lower echelons , it ’s pretty bloody awful			1
’ she came to prominence with her portrayal of social - climbing @entity161 in @entity37 from 1975 to 1978 , starring with @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 , and played lady of the manor @entity84 in to @entity7 , broadcast from 1979 to 1981			0
