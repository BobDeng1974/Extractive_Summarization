by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 31 july 2013 two sisters have spoken out about their rare condition which causes them to lose all of their skin every day			1
@entity0 and @entity5 suffer from a condition that speeds up their skin cell turnover , causing the top layer to shed six times faster than a normal , healthy person			1
the condition , called lamellar ichthyosis , affects just one in 600,000 people and the sisters ' father estimates that between them they lose four stone of skin every year			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) @entity18 suffer from the rare genetic skin condition lamellar ichthyosis , which means that their skin grows at six times the speed it should the college students must carefully apply cream to their skin twice a day , meaning it takes them two hours to get ready for college			1
@entity0 , 19 , said : ‘ it gets very itchy and can be painful			1
we have to apply cream head to toe every day			1
‘ we have to vacuum all the time because our skin gets everywhere , and the washing machine always breaks because the cream blocks it up			1
‘ i 'm lucky to have a sister who knows exactly what i 'm going through			0
we just get on with it now			0
’ @entity5 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) lose four stone of skin every year between them , their father has estimated			1
their condition only affects one in every 600,000 people @entity5 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) have to apply cream to their whole bodies twice a day which means it takes them two hours to get ready for college each morning both of @entity0 and @entity5 's parents are carriers of the ichthyosis gene but had no idea until @entity0 was born			1
the condition causes abnormal scaling and shedding of the skin which usually occurs within the first few days of life			2
sufferers tend to have plate - like scales of skin which often appear brownish in colour			2
the condition is caused by genetic abnormalities that affect the shedding of skin			2
it occurs when both of a child 's parents carry the abnormal gene - in this situation , there is a one in four chance that the child will have the condition			2
without the cream the sisters ' skin becomes very painful and itchy			2
they lose so much skin that they have to vacuum their house every day and their cream means that their washing machine regularly breaks both of @entity0 and @entity5 's parents are carriers of the ichthyosis gene – which means there was a one in four chance of their children having the disease - but had no idea until @entity0 was born it can also cause overheating as it prevents sweating and it can constrict the blood flow to the fingers and toes as skin tightens			1
sufferers can also experience eye problems , hair loss , and difficulty bending their hand joints			0
there is currently no cure and the key treatment is regularly applying moisturiser			0
@entity0 , from @entity110 - @entity111 , @entity112 , said : ‘ it was a big shock to my parents			2
‘ @entity115 had no idea what was wrong with me so i transferred to @entity118 where it got diagnosed			0
@entity120 causes the skin to become thicker and crack , especially around the joints , but the symptoms are partially relieved by the regular application of skin creams @entity0 ( right ) and @entity5 ( left ) say that they have to apply cream before and after showering in the morning , as well as in the evening ‘ no one else in the family has it			1

@entity5 , 17 , said : ‘ we put cream on before and after we have a shower in the morning and at night			1
it takes us about two hours to get ready			0
‘ we ca n't really apply the cream at college so if it cracks we just have to let it happen			2
‘ it 's worst in the summer - because we ca n't sweat it makes us very dry and itchy			0
we have to put extra cream on and stay in the shade			0
@entity5 ( pictured ) explained that the situation is worst in the summer because the condition means that they can not sweat			1
they have to stay in the shade and apply extra cream when the weather is hot @entity0 ( pictured ) says that she and her sister were bullied at school because of their condition but that they are always happy to tell people about it so that they understand ‘ it 's just a matter of being careful and you can prevent it			1
’ the girls go through a cycle of good and bad patches with their condition			0
the good phases last up to six weeks , followed by a period of two weeks when they shed extra skin			0
@entity0 said : ‘ we look normal in the good stage - we get our skin up to scratch and then it comes back with a vengeance			1
