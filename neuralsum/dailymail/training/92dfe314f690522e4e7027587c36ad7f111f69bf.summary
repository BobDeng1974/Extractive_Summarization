the @entity0 , @entity1 and the international community reacted swiftly , but with varying levels of intensity , on wednesday after reports from @entity6 indicated that the @entity8 regime had killed at least 1,300 people with a chemical weapons attack			1
while the @entity0 held its cards close to the vest , some in @entity14 were quick to blame the @entity16 administration for inviting genocide through a weak posture abroad			2
there are ' no consequences for @entity8 using chemical weapons & crossing red line , ' @entity20 @entity19 sen. @entity19 said in a tweet			1
' we should n't be surprised he 's using them again			0
' we have been very clear to the @entity8 regime , but also to other players on the ground , ' @entity16 said on august 20 , 2012 , ' that a red line for us is [ if ] we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized			1
that would change my calculus			0
' however , at an afternoon press conference the @entity0 continued to deflect demands that it must take unilateral action against the regime			0
' this is and should be a top priority of the @entity60 , ' said principal deputy press secretary @entity61 in a briefing with journalists			0
the @entity64 has scheduled a 3:00 p.m. emergency meeting to debate a response , but @entity68 - @entity6 's principal ally - can veto any proposal			1
but ' there is work , ' @entity61 insisted , ' that can be done with our international partners to try to continue to pressure the @entity8 regime			2
' ' those that are responsible for the use of chemical weapons -- if it 's determined that that 's what happened -- will be held accountable , ' he said			1
but when reporters pressed @entity61 on whether president @entity16 is ' willing to use the stick along with the rhetoric ' on @entity6 , he quipped that it was ' a philosophical question which i think is a legitimate one			1
' ' it might be better answered by the commander - in - chief himself			0
' killed : activists say dozens of children were among those killed by gas attack in @entity96 remains : a building is left barely standing after shelling by forces loyal to @entity6 's president @entity8 a reporter then asked , ' are you going to bring him out ? ' @entity61 refused to speculate on whether the @entity44 actions to date have caused @entity8 to feel enough pressure to consider ceding power to a democratically elected government			1
' there are a range of consequences ' that the administration has sought , he said			0
' it 's hard for me to speak to whether or not he [ @entity8 ] feels threatened			0
' but he acknowledged that ' steady escalation of aid that has been provided to the @entity6 opposition , ' along with humanitarian aid and negotiations with the international community , ... ' has not resulted in the outcome that we would like to see , which is the complete removal of @entity8 from power			1
' @entity61 dismissed a similar question about whether there was a ' red line ' that @entity127 's military rulers had crossed by killing more than 1,000 pro-muslim @entity129 protesters in @entity130			2
' i did n't bring my red pen out here with me today , ' he said			2
@entity61 insisted that a @entity60 inspection team , which has been on the ground in @entity6 since tuesday , should be allowed to investigate the sites of alleged chemical weapons use before the @entity44 or any other country mounts an organized response			1
' we think it 's important for that investigative team to be given access to that area , ' he said			0
he would not comment , however , on whether or not a ' red line ' would be crossed if the @entity8 government interferes with that investigation or refuses to grant the @entity60 team access to critical sites , including those shown in videos that circulated online wednesday			1
@entity68 , too , has urged an ' objective ' investigation into the footage and reports			0
@entity68 president @entity157 remains @entity8 's most powerful ally , in part because @entity6 hosts its last remaining naval base on the @entity161			1
but @entity162 reported wednesday afternoon that @entity68 's @entity163 has claimed pro-democracy rebels in @entity6 may have staged the attack in order to provoke international reactions against @entity8			1
on jan. 31 , @entity68 and @entity168 blocked @entity64 plan demanding that @entity8 hand over power to his deputy and allow a general election , and promising unspecified ' further measures ' if he did not comply			0
@entity175 , meanwhile , castigated the @entity8 regime for employing ' unacceptable violence ' against his own people , according to a translation provided to @entity180			0
' if the allegations are true , ' said the statement from the country 's foreign affairs minister , it would constitute ' a crime against humanity ' in an earlier statement today , @entity61 said the administration was ' deeply concerned ' by the news filtering out of @entity6 , and called on the @entity60 to investigate further			1
survivor : a boy weeps after surviving gas attack ' the @entity44 strongly condemns any and all use of chemical weapons ' @entity61 said in a statement			2
' those responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable			2
' ' today , we are formally requesting that the @entity60 urgently investigate this new allegation			0
the @entity60 investigative team , which is currently in @entity6 , is prepared to do so , and that is consistent with its purpose and mandate			2
' if it 's established conclusively that the chemical attacks did occur near @entity208 , as rebel groups have alleged , they would have been carried out while the @entity60 inspectors were on the ground nearby			0
@entity6 , meanwhile , has said via its state - controlled media that there is no truth to the accounts .			0

@entity60 *convenes* emergency meeting in response to reports and footage that *hundreds* including children were killed
a year ago president @entity16 said chemical weapons were ' the red line ' for @entity8
however , the administration continued to stress today that the @entity60 needs to lead the international response
@entity230 @entity19 says we should n't be surprised @entity8 has used chemical weapons because there are never any consequences for the @entity6 leader
