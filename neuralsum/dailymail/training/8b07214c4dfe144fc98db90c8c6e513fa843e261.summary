mandates to introduce new graphic warning labels were part of a law passed in 2009 that , for the first time , gave the federal government authority to regulate tobacco , including setting guidelines for marketing and labelling , banning certain products and limiting nicotine			2
addictive : a man with a tracheotomy smoking appears in a new label provided by the @entity0 today graphic : one of nine new warning labels cigarette makers will have to use by autumn 2012 the announcement follows reviews of scientific literature , public comments and results from an @entity0 - contracted study of 36 labels proposed last november			1
in recent years , more than 30 countries or jurisdictions have introduced labels similar to those being introduced by the @entity0			1
the @entity13 first mandated the use of warning labels stating ' cigarettes may be hazardous to your health ' in 1965			2
current warning labels - a small box with black and white text - were put on cigarette packs in the mid- 1980s			2
the @entity0 says the new labels will ' clearly and effectively convey the health risks of smoking ' aimed at encouraging current smokers to quit and discourage non-smokers and youth from starting to use cigarettes			1

warning labels also must appear in advertisements and constitute 20 per cent of an ad cancer - causing : the new labels mark the most significant change to @entity13 cigarette packs in 25 years the new labels come as the share of @entity13 who smoke has fallen dramatically since 1970 , from nearly 40 percent to about 20 percent			2
the rate has stalled since about 2004			0
about 46 million adults in the @entity13 smoke cigarettes			0
it 's unclear why declines in smoking have stalled			0

crackdown : they were proposed in november under a law that put the multibillion - dollar tobacco industry under the control of the @entity0 worth dying for ? tobacco is responsible for about 443,000 @entity13 deaths a year , according to the @entity0 the @entity156 said in a survey done in countries with graphic warning labels that a majority of smokers noticed the warnings and more than 25 per cent said the warnings led them to consider quitting			1
while some have voiced concerns over the hard - hitting nature of some of the labels , those concerns should be trumped by the government 's responsibility to warn people about the dangers of smoking , said @entity177 , a health behaviour researcher at the @entity179 in @entity180 , who worked with the firm designing the labels for the @entity0			1
' this is n't about doing what 's pleasant for people			0
it 's about fulfilling the government 's mandate if they 're going to allow these things to be sold , ' @entity177 said			0
' what 's bothering people is the risk associated with their behaviour , not the warnings themselves			0
' in places like @entity180 , @entity177 said smokers offended by some of the images on cigarettes packs there started asking for different packs when they received ones with certain gory images , or used a case to cover them up			0
but smokers said those warnings still had an effect on them			0
effective : the @entity156 said in a survey done in countries with graphic labels that a majority of smokers noticed the warnings and more than 25 per cent said the warnings led them to consider quitting bad for branding : tobacco makers have argued the warnings would relegate the companies ' brands to the bottom half of the cigarette packaging , making them ' difficult , if not impossible , to see ' @entity180 introduced similar warning labels in 2000			1
since then , its smoking rates have declined from about 26 per cent to about 20 per cent			0
how much the warnings contributed to the decline is unclear because the country also implemented other tobacco control efforts			0
the legality of the new labels also is part of a pending federal lawsuit filed by @entity233 , @entity235 - based @entity234 , parent company of @entity13 's second - largest cigarette maker , @entity238 ; number three cigarette maker , @entity240 , @entity235 - based @entity241 ; and others			1
