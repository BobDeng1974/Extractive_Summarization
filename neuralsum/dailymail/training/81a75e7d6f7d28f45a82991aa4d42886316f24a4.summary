by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:36 pm on 23rd june 2011 criticised : @entity3 mp @entity2 @entity3 mp @entity2 has been criticised after contractors working for his local council tarmacked the private road to his luxury home for free			1
workers employed by @entity9 resurfaced 164 feet of a lane not run by the council in @entity12 , @entity13 , at his wife @entity14 's request , despite nearby public roads and potholes in need of repair			1
taxpayers are angry that the stretch of road on @entity23 , @entity12 , which leads to the mp 's home has had preferential treatment over other road works			1
the stretch of asphalt would have cost £ 2,500 if mr @entity2 had paid for the job			1
contractors employed by the conservative @entity9 had been working on rectifying continuing road surface problems in @entity33 half - a - mile away when mrs @entity34 approached them and asked if they could surface her lane with any tarmac that was left over			1
the new surface leads directly to the @entity41 ' recently - built detached four - bedroom house in one of the most exclusive residential areas of the town			1
however , it does not extend to the other 18 properties further along the lane , which dates back to the @entity49 era			2
yesterday , mr @entity2 , mp for @entity12 and @entity51 , issued a statement defending the work			1
controversy : mp @entity56 home at @entity23 , @entity12 which has been tarmaced when other roads have pot holes he said : ' my wife was cycling past @entity61 it was being resurfaced			1
she asked one of the workmen if it would be possible to lay any leftover @entity66 in @entity23			2
' no payment was asked for , none was offered and none was given			2
my wife was not given any assurance that spare @entity66 would be used on @entity23			2
' when my wife returned home later that day she found part of the lane had been resurfaced			1
' mr @entity2 stressed the work had not only benefited him and his wife , but other residents in his street			1
he said : ' i understand one resident in @entity23 has since complained and that is why the contractors are writing to all the residents to see how many would like the new surface left and how many would like it to be pulled up			2
' they will , i am sure , abide by the feelings of the majority of residents			2
' residents in @entity12 said they would have liked to have seen the surfacing used on potholes and pavements			0
@entity91 , a worker at @entity93 shoe repair in @entity94 , said : ' that is disgusting			0
why did n't they fill in a few potholes on public roads ? this should n't be happening			0
' resident @entity103 , 50 , of @entity12 , also agreed the work could have been done on a public road			0
' this looks pretty bad to me , ' he said			0
' you need to get all the main roads sorted first			0
it could certainly have been put to better use			0
' freebie : the new surface leads directly to the @entity41 ' recently - built detached four - bedroom house but does not extend to the other 18 properties further along the lane @entity118 , @entity13 co-ordinator of the @entity119 , said he was ' surprised ' the work had been sanctioned			1
he said : ' even if no money exchanged hands in this case , mps need to be seen to be above this sort of thing after all the controversy over their expenses			0
' mr @entity2 is paid well enough as an mp and he has his own successful business			1
surely he should pay for something like this out of his own pocket like the rest of us ? ' i would hope he officially declares this as a benefit in kind in the register of members ' interests because that is what it is			0
' the resurfacing work on the gravel - covered lane was carried out by staff from construction firm @entity149			2
in a statement , the company said : ' at the end of a session of resurfacing works in @entity33 we were left with the remnants of blacktop material			0
' we had made a prior arrangement with a farmer to deposit the material with him			0
' on the day , however , we were approached by a resident who asked if we could lay the blacktop down nearby @entity23 , a rough , un-adopted road on which she lives			0
' we agreed to do so since it seemed to be an expedient and environmentally friendly way of dealing with the excess material			0
the @entity167 try team that carried out this job acted in the right and proper manner			0
' the laying of blacktop down @entity23 was carried out purely out of goodwill and without any money changing hands			0
' an @entity9 spokeswoman said : ' this is a private matter between a contractor and a resident and does not concern @entity9			1
' the spokesman for mr @entity2 said he would not be declaring the work as a gift , as he does not own the road .			1
