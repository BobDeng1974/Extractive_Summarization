' no. ' ' why not ? does n't it start with people like you ? ' ' no. ' points : the campaigner repeatedly points in @entity30 ' face while refusing to give up his phone for the cause @entity30 laughs as @entity4 accuses the media of ' destroying democracy ' and refuses to give up his phone forward : he then tells @entity30 to give up her own car before saying nobody should have to forfeit anything reaction : fields tweeted about @entity4 being ' handsy ' , @entity68 users responded attacking @entity4 's actions the conversation then fell into confusion			1
