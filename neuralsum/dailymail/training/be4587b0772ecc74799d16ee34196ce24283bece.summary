five - time @entity1 champions @entity0 are looking to take on @entity3 clubs and grab some of the growing market for soccer in the @entity6 by setting up a @entity6 registered company			1
@entity0 recently opened an office in @entity9 and on wednesday announced a partnership with a leading youth soccer organisation			0
@entity0 has teamed up with @entity13 - based @entity12 , which organises youth coaching and development programmes , and will provide assistance from coaches and technical staff from the @entity20 club			2
@entity20 giants @entity0 are keen on improving their fanbase in @entity6 @entity0 hope star players such as @entity24 and @entity25 , pictured , can help to attract fans ' this is the first of many initiatives we will be undertaking to foster a deeper connection with soccer fans in the @entity6 , ' said managing director of @entity0 's @entity6 division @entity33			1
@entity0 toured the @entity6 during the summer this year and played against the @entity35			2
' the @entity0 brand has become very well known in the last few years with the team reaching three @entity39 finals in four years and the @entity39 is the best soccer product in the @entity6			0
' we were also lucky to have seven @entity0 players who became champions at the @entity45 , ' he added , referring to @entity47 's triumph in @entity48 earlier this year			0
the 24 - times @entity50 champions already have launched a @entity6 specific website and online store to help drive merchandise sales to @entity6 fans			1
@entity0 are currently top of the @entity20 and remain unbeaten since the start of the league campaign ' we have done professional market research and found we have one million converted fans in the @entity6			1
people who are not only interested but who are really focused and supporting @entity0 , ' said @entity33 , who noted the large number of @entity6 with @entity50 ancestry provide another pool of potential fans			1
the most committed @entity0 fans are members of the 28 @entity0 supporter clubs dotted around the @entity6 , part of a growing trend of @entity6 ' adopting ' @entity1 clubs to support			1
but while @entity72 clubs such as @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 have gained strong footholds in the @entity6 along with @entity78 giants @entity79 and @entity80 , @entity20 teams have a less visible presence			2
@entity33 , however , believes that will change when a television deal kicks in next season and @entity20 games will move from the sometimes hard to find cable channel @entity87 to the more mainstream @entity88			0
' that is so important , sometimes people would ask where can i see the @entity20			0
that is going to change			0
@entity88 have made a huge commitment to the @entity20 , ' said @entity33 .			0
