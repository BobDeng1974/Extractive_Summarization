' i 'll be walking around the supermarket doing my food shopping and i have to put my earphones in to listen to my own music just in case it comes on			1
' it 's the same with most shops			2
i have to walk in with my ear phones in at first just to make sure they do n't have @entity3 on			0
' if he ever releases a greatest hits album it 's going to be a nightmare			2
' whenever i hear the first few beats of the song i have to drop whatever i am doing and run			2
' people might think it is funny - and i can laugh at it myself - but it has taken over my life			0
it 's ruined my life			0
' miss @entity0 , from @entity65 , @entity66 , had her first seizure on @entity68 in 2006 after a long period of sickness and doctors put it down to tiredness and stress			1
but when her seizures increased to six a day , her gp booked her in for a brain test and she was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2008			1
it was n't until she heard @entity3 's first big hit , ' @entity80 ' featuring @entity81 - which topped the charts in may 2011 - that she had her first music - induced seizure			1
her medical notes state : ' we recognised a few musicogenic seizures arising from the right temporal lobe stimulated by songs sung by @entity3 ' ( pictured ) in june , surgeons removed part of her left frontal lobe to try and stop the seizures			1
but the surgery was not successful and doctors now fear she may have the condition forever ' it took me a while to realise that they were being triggered by his songs			1
' it was n't until i 'd heard it for about the 15th time that it finally twigged what was going on			0
' ' the song was really popular and i went to my consultant and i said " i know this sounds extremely bizarre , but every time i hear this song i have a seizure "			2
' he said it was fascinating and that he 'd never heard anything like it			0
' i stressed that while it might be fascinating , i was really struggling - the song was everywhere at the time			0
' a musicogenic seizure is epilepsy triggered by certain types of music or even specific frequencies of pitch for which the person 's brain has a low threshold or tolerance			1
these sounds trigger abnormal activity on the brain			0
in some cases , merely thinking of the atmosphere and the emotions associated with a certain stimulus is enough to induce a seizure			0
they may also occur during sleep			0
to read more , click here miss @entity0 was referred to @entity142 's @entity141			1
there , doctors played @entity3 songs and were amazed when they induced a seizure			2
her doctors notes from the time say : ' we recognised a few musicogenic seizures arising from the right temporal lobe stimulated by songs sung by @entity3			1
' another added : ' during her admission she was listening to the radio on [ her ] @entity155 when a specific song came on the radio that triggers her fits ( @entity159 - tonight )			0
' she called for assistance at this point and she was noted to be shaking and looking rather anxious and acting a bit confused			0
' the following day we deliberately played the song and exactly the same symptoms arose			0
' the music attacks got more difficult to manage as the singer became more popular with every song he released , including top ten hits ' @entity24 ' and ' @entity170 ' in 2012			2
the 15 second seizures , which happen in her right temporal lobe , leave her ' staring blankly ' and after they pass she will vomit , be very thirsty and feel extremely sleepy			0
in june this year , miss @entity0 endured a six - hour long operation to remove a huge chunk of her left temporal lobe where doctors thought all her seizures may originate			1
but while the symptoms of her epilepsy have reduced , she still has a fit every time she hears @entity3 's voice			1
ms @entity0 has to wear earphones whenever she goes shopping just in case the ' @entity24 ' singer 's tunes are played in stores she said a recent holiday to @entity192 - just after the singer released his song play hard with @entity195 - was a ' nightmare ' with the song playing in every bar			1
' i have had to go up to djs in places and say ' look can you not play @entity3 ' and they just look at me like i 'm an alien , ' said @entity0			2
' [ doctors ] are saying it could possibly be something in the tone of his voice , something like that , but it does n't happen when i hear @entity211 , or people like him who have a very similar sound			1
it is only him , only @entity3			0
' ' our holiday this year to @entity192 was a nightmare			0
honestly it was like being at a @entity3 concert - the song was everywhere			0
' i had to stay in the hotel room for most of the holiday because it got so bad			0
