@entity0 will prioritise winning over remaining undefeated as @entity1 go in search of trophies			1
the @entity4 are unbeaten after 20 matches in all competitions this season , leading to suggestions of a @entity10 campaign without defeat			1
@entity1 , prevented from scoring for the first time last saturday at @entity13 , play @entity14 on wednesday and @entity0 knows silverware is the target , not matching @entity18 's ' @entity17 ' of a decade ago			1
he said : ' one thing is that i do n't think it 's possible ( to complete a season unbeaten )			1
the other thing is that we are not playing for that			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 ( left ) watches the action at the @entity27 from the sidelines ' if ( against @entity14 ) we have a 0 - 0 with 20 minutes to go , we are not going to play for the 0 - 0 to be undefeated after 21 matches			1
' if you play for that , if that is one objective , maybe you draw so many matches , you do n't take risks to try and win matches			1
you are happy just to be undefeated			2
' if you get 10 draws , you get 10 points			0
if you win five and lose five , you make 15 points			0
' we are going to play matches to win			1
and , sometimes , we will lose			0
' i 'd prefer 15 points and lost matches than 10 points and being undefeated			1
' @entity13 defender @entity44 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity1 midfielder @entity47 @entity1 have been scintillating at times , leading many to speak of the @entity4 as champions elect			1
the soaring @entity4 were checked at the @entity27 and even had to make the return journey from @entity51 by road			1
@entity0 added : ' we could n't even fly back to @entity54 by plane because of the fog			0
we had seven hours by bus to get back			0
" that gave the @entity60 time to reflect as he bids to secure his third @entity10 title and @entity1 's first since 2010			1
' we have to play , we have to win matches and must get points , ' @entity0 said			2
' that 's what we 're doing			2
we do n't promise anything			0
we do n't put ourselves in that position , of being arrogant to say we are going to win			0
we do n't do that			0
@entity70 gets in a tangle with @entity13 defender @entity72 during the 0 - 0 draw at the @entity27 ' all we say is we 're playing very well , we are getting results , we believe in ourselves , we are very happy with what we 're doing			1
' the measure of success in football is made by the trophies you win			0
we have to try to transform the quality of our work and performances into cups			0
' normally , the best team and best squad wins a league championship			0
but you can not choose to try to win this competition or that one			0
' we try to improve the team , try and have the best possible team playing the best possible football , adapted to different situations , and after that let 's see what is possible to win			2
' some consider only @entity99 capable of catching and overhauling @entity1 , but @entity0 disagrees			1
' there 's a long way to go , ' he added			2
' @entity103 with 10 - 12 - 14 - , 15 - point difference , they are not out of the title race			0
i do n't think so			0
