by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 06:04 est , 14 january 2014 a farmer is turning one of his fields into a stone age - style burial chamber where families can pay £ 1,000 to bury their relatives ' ashes			1
@entity11 landowner @entity10 , 52 , is laying down huge sarsen stones , similar to those at nearby @entity13 , to form the base of a burial mound which will eventually hold the remains of 2,400 people			1
the diggers moved in to his field at @entity20 , near @entity21 , after he won planning permission to build a 50m - long mound , the first such chamber to be built in @entity25 for 5,000 years			1
@entity11 farmer @entity10 , 52 , is turning one of his fields into a ' neolithic - style ' burial mound mr @entity10 says that that 50 - metre long mound at @entity20 should be completed within six months how it will look : the design of the @entity20 burial mound is based on @entity32 nearby mr @entity10 says it will take him six months to complete the mound , which will contain seven large chambers , each with several shelves containing lockable alcoves , or niches , that can be secured for a family			1
he plans to charge around £ 1,000 for a family niche with space for the ashes of up to eight people			1
the farmer , an atheist who works as a steward at @entity13 , said : ' we 've already had five people sign up , and that 's without really pushing it at all			1
' it 's being made of sarsen stones weighing up to one tonne each and is quite a simple construction			2
we will have to keep the inside secure as other people 's remains will be in there too , but the idea is that it will be a place for families to come			2
' they 'll be able to sit and contemplate on the mound '			2
mr @entity10 said the burial chamber will be non-religious , but it is already attracting interest from pagans because of its alignment , designed to allow the sunrise of the winter solstice to shine through the entrance and down its passageway			1
mr @entity10 , seen here sitting on what will be the entrance , says he has had a good deal of interest already the burial mound lies in the @entity76 , near @entity13 and @entity78 stone circles , and its design is based on the nearby long barrow at @entity32 , near @entity81 , the largest man - made mound in @entity84			1
the 220 - acre farm lies in the middle of @entity11 's ' crop circle country ' , where mysterious patterns appear in fields of crops overnight			2
theories as to how they occur range from @entity95 landings to over-zealous cider - drinking , but they draw large crowds each summer			0
@entity11 is strewn with @entity99 burial mounds , or barrows , dating back to the new stone age period , beginning about @entity102 and ending between 4,500 - 2,000bc			2
they were constructed using vast sarsen stones or wooden posts and then covered with mud , soil and grass			0
@entity32 , six miles from mr @entity10 's barrow at @entity20 , is one of the largest , measuring 100m long			1
excavations suggest work began on the tomb , which has five sarsen stone chambers , in @entity115 , some 400 years before @entity13 was begun			0
@entity81 , pictured , dates back to the @entity99 period but mystery still surrounds its original purpose @entity119 is the largest in @entity25 , a wedge - shaped burial chamber measuring 106m long			0
it is believed to have been open for several centuries before being sealed up			0
@entity123 , near @entity124 , is a late @entity99 long barrow which was found to contain the remains of several people from the same family , ranging in age from 12 months to 60 years			0
@entity130 , near @entity78 , is one of the oldest known barrows in the country , dating back to around @entity133			0
its two ends have been ploughed away and destroyed , but the remains of one of the @entity143 folk , migrants into @entity25 in @entity137 who were notable for the beaker shape of their pottery , have been found in the barrow			0
@entity81 , a vast chalk mound 16 miles from @entity13 , is not strictly a barrow but is a man - made mound from the same , @entity99 period and can be seen from many of the barrows that post-date it			0
despite various attempts to excavate it over the years , and despite a common assumption over the years that it must be a burial mound , its purpose is still a mystery			0

@entity11 farmer @entity10 , 52 , is building mound in field near @entity21
it will have chambers full of shelves where urns of ashes will be placed
@entity170 's entrance is aligned so winter solstice sun will shine through it
mr @entity10 says he 's already had *enquiries* from people *wanting* to book space
the mound 's design is based on that of nearby @entity32
