by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 cricket ’s crackdown on throwing claimed its highest - profile victim in @entity7 on tuesday , before it was revealed that on - field testing could soon be brought in to finally rid the world game of the chuckers			1
the @entity11 , long derided as a toothless governing body , caused a stir when they banned the best spinner in the world			1
it is part of a concerted campaign against chucking which has also seen @entity20 ’s @entity19 and @entity22 ’s @entity21 stopped from bowling			1
@entity24 and @entity25 spinner @entity7 was reported for a second time after the first test against @entity20 in @entity28			1
in a move which has ramifications for the international and domestic game , he faces a public fight for his future			0
though never suspended , @entity42 was called for chucking on numerous occasions throughout his career			0
he even went on tv to bowl with a special cast on to try to prove his innocence			0
@entity53 the @entity55 paceman was suspended by the @entity11 in december 1999 but had his ban lifted almost immediately			1
@entity53 was regularly bowling around 95mph but there were concerns about the straightening of his arm before sending down a bouncer or a quicker ball			1
@entity63 the @entity65 fast bowler emerged at a similar time to @entity53 and his speed raised similar suspicions of an illegal action			0
but the @entity11 cleared him in the summer of 2000			2
@entity70 as well as being banned in 2008 over a match - fixing scandal , the part - time @entity72 offspinner was prohibited from bowling quick deliveries in international cricket due to his action			1
@entity7 , who earlier this season bowled @entity25 to a formidable position in the race for second division promotion , is adamant he can prove his innocence in time for february ’s @entity83			2
‘ it is very disappointing but i ’m a fighter and i know what i have to do to get back before the @entity83 , ’ said @entity7 , 36			2
all of his deliveries , not just the doosra , were found to be illegal after biomechanical tests in @entity41			1
‘ the ban is not a problem for me			0
the @entity11 have stopped me from bowling because my elbow is bending beyond the 15 degrees allowed and i know i can correct that			1
my elbow is not usual			0
that ’s why i seem to bend it more			0
’ yet @entity7 , who blamed a car accident which damaged his elbow the first time he was reported for throwing five years ago , will have to fight back the hard way once @entity11 plans for sensors that can be worn during matches to identify throwing are introduced			1
these are at the final stage of testing in @entity41			2
players will wear two sensors on the back of the arm near the elbow in an attempt to provide more accurate results than those garnered by laboratories away from match conditions			2
@entity7 is a popular figure who has proved both a mentor and an inspiration to @entity121 ’s @entity120			2
there was widespread sympathy for a man who has proved a magician in the @entity42 mould , provides no danger to batsmen and has been the highest wicket - taker in world cricket across all formats in the last three years			2
yet there are plenty who will welcome this move as he has long been suspected of throwing — not least privately by @entity121 when he bowled them to a 3 - 0 test whitewash two years ago			0
only this season @entity139 posted a picture on @entity143 bowling for @entity25 with the former @entity121 captain and @entity145 then apparently questioning the validity of the @entity55 ’s action			0
there will also be those who question the validity of @entity25 ’ s probable promotion after @entity7 ’s leading role in taking 63 wickets as their overseas player before leaving for international duty			0
@entity7 added a yorker fired in at 70mph to his repertoire this season and that has caused consternation because of its ability to bamboozle top order players who were simply unable to pick it			0
accused : @entity65 @entity63 ( left ) and @entity44 @entity42 both had questionable techniques highly regarded : @entity7 is the world 's top - ranked one - day international bowler essex are one of the counties likely to miss out on promotion because of @entity25 ’s success but there were no complaints from their coach @entity173			1
he said on tuesday : ‘ @entity25 have played some very good cricket this season and they are far from a one - man band			0
‘ the last thing i want to be accused of is sour grapes by complaining now but what i would question is why none of the county umpires reported @entity7			1
this only came to light when he went off to play for @entity24			0
’ @entity7 will almost certainly miss @entity24 ’s @entity186 series against @entity187 next month while he undergoes remedial action but will take heart from the fact that he was cleared the last time this happened			1
in 2009 , testing in @entity194 found that @entity7 ’s elbow has a 23.5 degree bend			0
yet , with the @entity11 deciding that throwing is a major problem among spinners , and not just ‘ mystery ’ ones , a man who turns 37 next month faces a race against time if he is to be seen at the highest level again .			1

@entity7 has been banned by the @entity11 for an indefinite period
the @entity24 spinner was penalised after straightening his arm by more than 15 degrees in all of his deliveries while being tested in @entity41
he was also reported by the match officials during @entity24 's seven - wicket loss to @entity20 last month
