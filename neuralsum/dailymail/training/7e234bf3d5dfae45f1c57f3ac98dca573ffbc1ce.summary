@entity6 , 22 , is a pastor at the @entity7 in the @entity8 outside @entity9 , @entity10			1
the church is part of century - old @entity14 tradition in the region that takes literally an instruction in the @entity17 that ' they shall take up serpents			1
' risky business : father - of - five @entity23 has been badly bitten by snakes four times , one occasion has even left him permanently disfigured devoted : the defiant preacher faces up to a year in prison after being charged with illegally possessing 53 venomous snakes seized from his church by @entity10 wildlife agency officers earlier this month but the defiant preacher faces up to a year in prison after being charged with illegally possessing 53 venomous snakes seized from his church by @entity10 wildlife agency officers earlier this month			1
under the laws of the state anyone owning venomous snakes , even zoos and circuses , must apply for permits and comply with specific requirements to guarantee public safety			2
his devotion has left him crippled as he is unable to make a fist following a snakebite on the knuckle which almost killed him in 2010			2
' i was at death 's door , ' he said			0
' me and death were just about ready to smoke a cigarette together			0
' he believes his recovery is a direct result of @entity59 's will and cites another serious bite - this time to the neck - sustained soon after as proof that he is protected from harm by his faith			2
the incident left his shirt soaked in blood but he says he escaped serious injury adding : ' i never swelled , i never itched , i never suffered nothing but bleeding			0
' raucous : congregation members speak in tongues , weep and bang tambourines in services which can last up to 5 hours and despite the physical threat and appearing in court mr @entity6 has continued worship with the huge rattlesnakes thrust above his head after his followers helped smuggle in new creatures after the previous batch were confiscated			1
they claim that they are victims of a state crackdown after another preach @entity88 had two copperheads confiscated after being stopped while driving home through @entity10 earlier this year			0
during the raucous services , worshippers dance , bang tambourines , speak in tongues and handle the 3ft long animals believing that they are protected from danger by @entity59			0
speaking to the @entity98 he said : ' i 'm willing to fight this , because here in the @entity103 we 're supposed to be guaranteed our religious freedom under the first amendment of the constitution			0
' we 're @entity107 who believe in being saved by the blood of @entity109 just like any other â€“ it 's not like we 're part of some different religion			0
i do feel it is an attack upon our religious freedom			0
' mr @entity6 said he was called on by @entity59 to handle the creatures , and that their appearances were shows of divine power			1
he has also likened the practice to ' @entity120 using wine			0
' prominent : unlike many other snake - handling pastors who preach in homes and behind closed doors , @entity6 preaches at the @entity7 in @entity9 , @entity10 , and is determined to bring his practices to the masses however these claims have been dismissed by authorities who maintain that the practices constiture a serious ' public safety hazard			1
' @entity133 , a wildlife agency spokesman said : ' we treat him just as we would anyone else found to be storing venomous snakes in their home			2
the presence of children at the services , including mr @entity6 's own five , only adds to safety concerns but mr @entity6 maintains that only over 18s ever handle the reptiles			1
he added : ' i can understand not wanting to endanger another 's life			0
but in 100 years , there have been only 10 deaths in @entity10 from serpents			2
' despite this a number of pastors in recent years have met their demise because of their unorthodox methods of worship			0
@entity157 of @entity158 , who led one of the best - attended snake - handling churches out of an estimated 125 in the region , was killed by a timber rattlesnake in may last year			1
his own father , also a snake - handling preacher also died from a rattlesnake bit in the 1980s			1
but while dozens of his fellow pastors hold their services in secret and close their doors to outsiders , mr @entity6 is determined to bring his sect into the mainstream and hopes to found @entity103 's first snake - handling mega-church			1
he is due back in court next month , and may face additional charges but refuses to stop the snakes , whatever the consequences .			0
