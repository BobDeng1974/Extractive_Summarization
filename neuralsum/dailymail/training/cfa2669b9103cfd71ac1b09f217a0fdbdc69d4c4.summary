by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 6:52 pm on 1st march 2012 a @entity3 press relations firm made the ultimate faux pas by highlighting crass and offensive stereotypes about the @entity6 while trying to promote the state of @entity8 to @entity10 tourists			1
the company , hired by @entity8 ’s tourism commissioner to promote the state abroad , dedicated whole web pages to the good looks of the state ’s residents and the thrill of playing ‘ roadkill bingo ’			1
this was a game where roadtrippers count the number of dead carcases on the side of the highway			0
outrageous : the site , which has now been removed , encouraged visitors to play a game by counting points that they earn by spotting different animal carcasses after telling of the scenic drives through national parks , the website dedicated to the morbid game of spotting the various roadkill seen in the state			1
‘ some drives can drag a bit , even with the jingle jangle of the banjo on the bluegrass - playing radio stations , so it 's good to spice them up with some fun car games , ’ it read before being removed			2
‘ ok , it seems a bit sick , spotting dead animals , but you will never see so much roadkill in your life , and so varied			2
‘ sadly , roadkill is a fact of life in @entity57 ; the locals are used to it and as they say , when in @entity61 ... so , if you can get over the sadness , and the blood , give it a whirl			0
’ the site went on to attribute points to the different animals one may spot - giving one point for a dead racoon , two for squirrels , three for rabbits , four for possums , five for coyotes , and six for deer			0
scenic : the website highlights the prospect of roadkill alongside @entity8 's roads , such as this one cutting through the state 's @entity82 mistake : the pr firm urged @entity3 tourists to vist ' @entity87 - home of @entity88 and the @entity90 boys ' in @entity8 - although this was a fictional county in @entity92			1
@entity93 is pictured as @entity94 the pr firm also urged @entity3 tourists to visit ' @entity87 - inspirational home of @entity88 and the @entity90 boys ' - although this was in fact a fictional place for @entity101 in @entity92			1
the site , published by @entity3 firm @entity103 , had been up since december and it was only this week that the @entity105 , @entity106 , resigned because of the scandal			0
' ok , it seems a bit sick , spotting dead animals , but you will never see so much roadkill in your life , and so varied ' @entity8 tourism website the day before his resignation , a local newspaper said that @entity103 paid for $ 735 of meals and event tickets for mr @entity106 on trip he took to @entity122 in june of last year which is a violation of state ethics laws			1
the company had been given $ 647,769 by the state of @entity8 since they were given the contract to promote the state in 2008			1
that came to a quick halt when the website - which cost $ 20,000 annually - was taken down on tuesday and the $ 179,900 - a - year contract disbanded on wednesday			1
ladies and liquor : the @entity103 site also boasted about the lovely ladies of @entity8 and famous celebs who call the state their home ‘ @entity103 has performed excellently for us in the past , ’ mr @entity106 said in a statement			1
‘ however , in the case of the website , they made serious errors			0
it was my responsibility to catch those errors			0
i did not and believe at this time that the best course of action is for me to resign			0
’ resigned : @entity8 tourism commissioner @entity106 resigned after a website he was in charge of promoted crass stereotypes of the state over the course of their professional relationship , mr @entity106 made one logistical correction to the website , and even commended them for their tongue - in - cheek manner			1
‘ i really like the site , especially the edginess of it			0
i wish we could get away with that over here ! ’ he wrote in a 2010 email to gosh @entity162 clearly , that ‘ edginess ’ is not accepted in @entity8 , and the state ’s @entity168 leader spoke out about the great expense that the ordeal cost them			2
‘ the fact that the state of @entity8 has spent close to $ 700,000 with a company that wants to bill us as the @entity181 is just a ridiculous example of how we waste taxpayer dollars in @entity185 , ’ said @entity174 , chairman of the state ’s @entity168 group			2
@entity186 , managing director of @entity103 , has now apologised to @entity8 and said the firm ' fully appreciates that this article may have caused offence ' ' we love the state of @entity8 , ' she told the @entity191			2
' it was never our intention to create upset			0
our focus was always on promoting @entity8 to the @entity3 market			0
