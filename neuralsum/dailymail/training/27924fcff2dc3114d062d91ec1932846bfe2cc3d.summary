by @entity1 reporter published : 09:13 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 12:37 est , 7 november 2012 @entity4 prices will not return to their pre-crisis peak until 2019 , making this the longest fall in the housing market since records began , a report says today			0
it predicts that prices will drop in every region next year , with @entity13 and @entity14 among the worst hit			1
the report , from the estate agency @entity17 , says prices peaked at an average of £ 183,959 in 2007 but have fallen so dramatically that they will not return to this level until 2019 at the earliest			2
on the slide : house prices have been falling for two years and are heading back towards the 2009 lows this 12 - year recovery period is the longest since records began in the 1950s			1
the report says the recovery is even further away if inflation is taken into account			0
if the increases in the cost of living are also considered , the date slips back to 2031			0
during the last housing market fall , prices peaked in 1989 at £ 62,782 and did not reach that level again until 1998			0
in a report yesterday , @entity36 , the country ’s biggest mortgage lender , said prices have dropped for each of the last four months and were down 0.7 per cent last month			1
the average home now costs £ 158,426			1
another report , from the @entity44 , says the number of properties that are available to buy has plunged since the recession			0
@entity48 , @entity36 ’s housing economist , said : ‘ signs of a modest deterioration in the trend in house prices continued in october			1
prices in the three months to october were 1.2 per cent lower than in the preceding three months			2
‘ the weak economic background has been a key factor dampening housing demand this year			0
recent encouraging developments relating to the level of overall economic activity and conditions in the labour market , however , may help to support demand and underpin house prices around current levels over the coming months			1
’ drifting down : a stagnant property market has seen house prices gently slide lower after the brief recovery in late 2009 and early 2010 the downbeat @entity36 update echoes a report by property listing website @entity70 that claimed nearly a fifth of homeowners who bought their property in the last five years are now saddled with negative equity			1
it said that 17 per cent of people who purchased a home since 2007 have a mortgage balance bigger than the value of their home			2
the most recent @entity84 figures , which are based on transactions , recorded house prices in @entity87 and @entity13 up 1.1 per cent to an average of £ 162,561 in the year to september			1
however , this continues to be skewed by @entity91 prices , which were up 5.5 per cent annually – more than twice as fast as the next highest rise of 2.3 per cent seen in the @entity93			2
property prices rose in four of the regions surveyed and fell in the other six			0
takes time : @entity98 , ceo of @entity91 estate agent @entity99 and @entity100 , says it will be some time before the overall national property market returns to health @entity98 , ceo of upmarket @entity91 estate agent @entity99 and @entity100 , said that it will be some time before the overall national property market returns to health			0
he said : ' @entity36 ’s figures portray a downbeat performance from house prices in recent months , and reflect the troubled state of the national housing market			1
' buyers ’ spending power is still squeezed , with wage inflation still lagging behind the growing cost of living , and while there are signs that mortgage lending is beginning to head in the right direction , it will be quite some time before it returns to the level needed for significant improvement in the number of buyers able to move home each month			0
' the tale is very different in @entity91			0
while house price growth has been steadying in recent months , prime areas in the capital are still seeing double digit annual growth as a result of the demand from wealthier equity rich buyers , and this is helping support the average national house price			2

the average home dipped by 0.7 per cent in value
a two - year slide on the @entity36 index has seen most gains after house prices *bounced* back in 2009 , 2010
