by @entity0 published : 03:24 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 05:51 est , 28 march 2012 a boy genius who finished college at 11 is about to graduate with a degree in maths at just 14 years old			1
and @entity5 now faces a dilemma that troubles very few young teenagers			1
the @entity9 - based student is trying to decide whether to study astrophysics or physics for his second university degree			1
precocious child : @entity5 , pictured with his mother @entity14 , began reading college - level books aged two @entity5 's mother @entity14 said she realised her son ’s incredible abilities when he started reading college - level books at age two			1
after completing his studies at @entity22 aged 11 , @entity5 took up maths at @entity24 ( @entity24 , @entity9 )			1
the family say his fellow students - who are nearly a decade older than @entity5 - have been supportive of the 14 - year - old			1
' at first they were really curious , what am i doing there ? ' @entity5 told @entity32			1
' [ then ] they started being like big brothers and big sisters			0
' he said he now prefers to spend time with his classmates rather than children of his own age			2
remarkable intellect : @entity5 is also a published author , having written a book about his experiences called ' we can do ' ' we talk about [ life ] and studies and all the material in class , ' he said			1
but in spite of his early accomplishments , the precocious teenager says he does not want to be defined purely by his intellect			0
' genius is just a word just like iq is a number , ' he said			0
' it just classifies [ them ] at one point and ignores everything else that makes the individual who they are			0
' his mother , who chaperones the youngster to class , said : ' he ’s a happy kid and he ’s learning so well			0
he ’s doing a fantastic job by himself			0
' @entity5 ’s father @entity68 said that he realised his son ’s potential one afternoon as he picked him up from school			2
early development : the young teenager says he now prefers spending time with his friends on campus than with children his own age ' i saw him outside , he was tutoring the mother of another kid , ' said mr @entity5			2
' it was fantastic , i almost cried that day			0
' mr @entity5 decided his son needed to be put in advanced classes after his teachers said @entity5 ’s academic needs would disturb the other children			2
@entity5 was enrolled at @entity22 aged eight - but he insists he was not forced into advanced classes too young			1
' most people say that my parents pushed me , ' he said			0
' however , i think happiness in childhood is more importantly passed on [ through ] loving parents and a creative environment			0
' as @entity5 prepares for his second degree , he plans to spend his summer having fun scuba diving and learning to drive			1
unfortunately , despite his exceptional talents , he will still have to wait until he is 16 to get his licence			0
difficult lessons : @entity5 's mother , left , sits in advanced maths classes with him , while his peers , right , say they do not believe age makes much difference			2

@entity9 - based @entity5 finished college at 11
plans to spend the summer learning to scuba - dive
