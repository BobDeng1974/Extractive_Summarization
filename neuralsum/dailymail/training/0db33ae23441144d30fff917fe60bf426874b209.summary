the admission last night came less than two weeks after shoppers were reassured that tests on meat products on sale in @entity15 supermarkets had been completed			1
the supermarket giant apologised to its customers after confirming that packs of its @entity2 simply @entity18 had become the fourth of its products to test positive for horse meat contamination			1
the emergence of the tainted meatloaf at @entity2 is the latest development in the scandal that began in january , when @entity42 food inspectors announced that traces of horse meat had been discovered in frozen beef burgers being sold at a number of @entity15 supermarkets			1
it has since engulfed major stores and brands including @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , and a new survey has revealed the impact of the furore on the nation 's shopping habits			1
@entity2 's frozen meatloaf is the latest in a string of beef products recalled by @entity15 food firms and supermarkets since the horse meat scandal first hit the headlines in january			1
a first wave of tests found horse dna in products including @entity70 's special frozen beef lasagne and special frozen spaghetti bolognese , co-op frozen quarter - pounder burgers , @entity51 beef lasagne , @entity75 's catering burger products , and @entity77 frozen burgers and value spaghetti bolognese			1

@entity101 also withdrew wiener sausages in the @entity15 last month after tests found ' indications ' of horse meat , and it also withdrew a batch of its traditional meatballs			1

it showed three in five people have changed their eating habits in the wake of the scandal that continues to rock the food industry			1
nearly a third are buying less processed meat , such as burgers , while one in four now avoid meat - based ready meals			1
@entity2 said it had pulled the 600g packs of @entity128 , made between october last year and january at @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity113 , from its shelves			2
@entity132 , its group technical director , said : ' tests on 15 other lines from the same manufacturing site were clear of horse meat			1
' our investigation to thoroughly understand the source of the contamination has started and we will complete our investigation before deciding whether to continue using the supplier			0
' we are very sorry that we have had a further product which has failed to meet the high standards we and our customers expect			0
' he said the company had now tested 500 product lines			0

it says the @entity167 should have greater powers to investigate and enter premises where food fraud is suspected			0
the survey , conducted late last month , also revealed that two - thirds of people ( 68 per cent ) do not think the government has been giving enough attention to enforcing labelling laws , with half of consumers ( 50 per cent ) not confident that ingredient information is accurate			2
it found that 44 per cent now spend more time looking at the ingredients label on meat products , with 83 per cent agreeing that country of origin labelling should be required on such items			0
confidence in food safety has also dropped , from nine in 10 feeling confident when buying products in the supermarket before the scandal broke to seven in 10 feeling confident now			2
which ? executive director @entity190 said : ' the horse meat scandal exposed the need for urgent changes to the way food fraud is detected and standards are enforced			1
these serious failings must be put right if consumers are to feel fully confident in the food they are buying once more			0
tests : the tainted packs of meatloaf were manufactured at @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity2 said ' ministers must ensure that everyone involved , including their own departments , the @entity167 ( @entity167 ) , the food industry and local authorities , are crystal clear about their responsibility to protect consumers and are properly equipped to do so			2
' which ? has called on the government to take five ' urgent ' steps , including more surveillance that is better co-ordinated between the @entity214 ( @entity214 ) , the @entity167 and local authorities , and the immediate scrapping of proposals to decriminalise failure to comply with food labelling legislation			0
it also wants the food industry to improve traceability , labelling and testing of products , with the responsibility for labelling policy returned to the @entity167 from @entity214			0
which ? said : ' consumers should know what 's in their food and where it 's from			0
' the government should push for the @entity235 - wide country - of - origin labelling to cover processed meat used in meat products , like ready meals			1
' it should also scrap its plans to drop national rules requiring clear ingredient labels for meat sold loose , like in a delicatessen			0
' it added : ' the scandal shows this split ( between @entity214 and the @entity167 ) causes unnecessary confusion and complication			0
the government should now move responsibility for labelling and standards responsibilities back to the @entity167			0
