@entity0 is to fly out on a £ 6,000 taxpayer - funded trip to @entity2 , where he is expected to have secret talks with his controversial choice as the new commons chief			1
the disclosure came as the @entity8 faced a growing all - party revolt over his plan to appoint @entity2 parliament official @entity12 as the £ 200,000 - a - year @entity13 , responsible for vital constitutional matters			1
defiant mr @entity0 will have crisis talks with commons leader @entity16 tomorrow after returning from holiday in @entity18 , then make an emergency statement to @entity20 on the issue			1
senior mps claim @entity33 , dubbed ‘ the @entity35 caterer ’ because her responsibilities at the @entity2 senate include managing kitchens and cleaning , is too inexperienced , and say mr @entity0 plans to use her appointment to grab more power for himself			1
he has been warned by close allies that he could be ejected from the speaker ’s chair if he refuses to back down and scrap the proposal			2
mrs @entity12 has made it clear that she has no intention of withdrawing from her proposed £ 200,000 - a - year job well - placed sources say @entity33 has made it clear that she has no intention of withdrawing from her proposed job			2
@entity32 have backed a demand by @entity54 grandee @entity53 , the chairman of the powerful @entity55 , to quiz @entity33 before her appointment is approved by @entity56 and @entity57			2
initially , mr @entity0 dismissed the revolt as the latest attempt by his @entity54 critics to unseat him			1
but the rebels have gained strong support from senior @entity64 figures including @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , the chairman of the influential @entity70 , as well as @entity72 elder statesman sir @entity73 and former speaker @entity74			2
equally damaging , it is understood all three deputy speakers – @entity64 ’s @entity77 and @entity78 and @entity54 @entity79 – are against @entity33 ’s appointment			2
mr @entity0 has tried to defuse the row by suggesting the @entity83 ’s job be split , with mrs @entity12 becoming chief executive in a managerial role , and the clerk ’s job handed to a parliamentary expert			1
but critics have said he has no right to change the clerk ’s job without @entity32 ’ permission – and say the extra £ 200,000 - a - year salary would be a waste of public money			2
a spokesman for the speaker tried to play down the row saying : ‘ the speaker is keen to listen to the views of @entity32			2
’ she said his visit to @entity2 was planned a year ago and that @entity101 visits to meet other speakers were ‘ an important element ’ of his job			1
he will be accompanied by an aide			2
think again , mr speaker			1
your @entity2 is patently not up to it says @entity109 , @entity54 mp a disagreement over a new @entity111 ? you might think politics does n’t get any more petty or irrelevant than that			1
what could matter less when there is so much sickness and suffering in the world today ? you would be wrong			2
the role of the clerk dates back to the 14th century and combines two crucial functions			2
the clerk is , first and foremost , the principal constitutional and procedural adviser to the @entity122 , available to be consulted by any mp on any such matter , great or small			0
parliamentary procedure is very complex ; issues in the @entity126 often require an immediate decision , and such decisions affect everything from the air we breathe to peace and war			0
so it is obviously vital for mps to have authoritative advice right on hand			0
as @entity20 has expanded , so too has the clerk ’s job			1
today the clerk has a @entity141 which runs an organisation of some 2,000 people , with a budget of £ 245 million			0
@entity146 @entity145 ( left ) , outgoing clerk @entity147 ( centre ) and speaker @entity0 ( right ) but the constitutional role is primary			1
sometimes the clerk ’s advice is unpalatable to governments or to speakers , and so the clerkship is protected by letters patent from the @entity156			0
only @entity20 itself can remove a clerk			1
ten days ago it became clear that a panel chaired by the speaker , @entity0 , was proposing as a new clerk someone who was patently not qualified for the job			1
the candidate , @entity12 , is a senior official in the @entity2 @entity20			1
she may be an extremely effective administrator , but she has little or no expertise in @entity166 constitutional law and procedure			0
in the delicate words of dr @entity175 , the @entity176 , ‘ @entity12 comes from the state public service			0
it is not simple to move to serving @entity20 if there is a lack of understanding of @entity20 ’			1
yet the letter of nomination for @entity33 had already gone to @entity179			0
without rapid action it would be forwarded to @entity57 , and approval would automatically follow			0
last wednesday i submitted a motion requiring mps to be given the opportunity to scrutinise the appointment , co-sponsored by the @entity64 mp @entity68			0
it has been signed by 84 mps from across the political spectrum , including three former foreign secretaries , a former deputy leader of the @entity64 and six former ministers			1
it is framed in simple , neutral language : ‘ the recommendation of ms @entity12 to be clerk of this @entity122 should be subject to , and contingent upon , a pre-appointment hearing and report by a select committee			0
’ the motion was designed to be non-partisan , yet the reaction has been highly surprising			0
so far there has not been any indication that @entity20 will be given a say on this matter			1
nor has the appointment of ms @entity12 been withdrawn			0
instead , it has been proposed that the role of clerk should be split and a new chief executive ( presumably @entity33 ) be appointed as well			0
this effectively concedes that @entity33 is not qualified to be clerk			0
but instead of dropping her and starting again , it puts the cart before the horse and proposes an on - the - hoof restructuring of the @entity122 , all , it seems , in order to accommodate her appointment			0
not only that – it proposes a new role of chief executive at a probable cost of £ 150,000 - £ 200,000			0
but the issues go beyond @entity228 herself , or the creation of a chief executive role			0
the whole appointment process has been seriously flawed			0
key people , such as the deputy speaker , @entity64 mp @entity77 , were not included			0
the process was delayed by internal disagreements , and but for the intervention of @entity32 last week , would have been completed when mps were on holiday			0
headhunters were used for the first time – doubtless at some cost – yet selected a candidate who did not even meet the basic job description set out in the original advertisement			1
and it is far from clear how they could have recommended a candidate who was , and remains , under investigation in @entity2 for maladministration			1
but there is still a deeper issue			1
mr @entity0 was elected after his predecessor @entity253 lost a vote of no confidence – an extraordinarily rare and damaging event for the speaker			1
if it is allowed to drag on , the appointment of ms @entity12 has the potential to cause new damage to the office of speaker , and so to the @entity122			0
tomorrow mr @entity0 is to make a statement in the @entity126 on this issue			1
we must hope he will move swiftly to end that appointment , reaffirm the importance of due process in the selection of public officials , and put the wider issue of the @entity273 before a special committee elected by @entity32 .			2

@entity0 will meet commons leader @entity16 tomorrow to discuss the crisis
mr @entity0 will then make an emergency statement to @entity20 on issue
he is expected to fly to @entity2 in the middle of next month
