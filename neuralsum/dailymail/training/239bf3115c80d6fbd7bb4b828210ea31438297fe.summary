@entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , have posted an online request form on their website offering to supply information about @entity3 's @entity18 training program after the trial			1
publicity stunt ? the request form for information on @entity3 's training program posted on the @entity11 website the gym is offering to supply details of the @entity18 training @entity3 received before allegedly murdering 17 - year - old @entity4 but since the form was put up the gym has received a flurry of negative messages on its @entity32 social media page , with the owner @entity33 of being accused of racism			1
one user @entity35 wrote : ' this place is a dump			0
owned by a big racist			0
' another post read : ' bunch of losers crooks and downright horrible people capitalising off the death of a young man			0
' mr @entity33 had earlier testified to the trial how @entity3 was an utter novice at martial arts and described him as being ' grossly obese '			1
he said that in terms of physical ability , he would rate @entity3 as 1 out of 10 and no higher than a 1.5 out of 10 as a wrestler , suggesting the form may have been intended for media requests			1
the trial has heard from a witness who claimed the 17 - year - old had overpowered @entity3 during their struggle and had pinned him to the ground moments before he was shot			1
the witness said : ' where i first walked out there , the black guy was on top and the only reason i can tell that was because the guy that was on the ground under him at that point wrestling was definitely a lighter color			0
' gym owner @entity33 ( left ) told the trial that @entity3 ( right ) was a novice martial artist and described him as being ' grossly obese ' @entity3 , who has been described as a ' wannabe cop ' had reportedly been training intensely in @entity18 three days before the shooting			1
in his closing arguments , @entity13 state prosecutor @entity73 told the jury : ' a teenager is dead			2
' he is dead through no fault of his own			0
he is dead because another man made assumptions			0
because his assumptions were wrong , @entity81 will no longer walk on this @entity83			0
' mr @entity73 portrayed @entity3 as a predator , not the good citizen who , as portrayed by the defense , was attacked by a 17 - year - old whose actions led to his own death			2
victim : @entity3 is accused of murdering the unarmed black teenager after following him with a gun and provoking him into a fight defense lawyers are due to present their closing arguments today , followed by a final prosecution rebuttal , after which the jury would begin deliberating a case that has captivated and polarized much of the @entity100 public			2
time and again , @entity73 accused @entity3 of lying about what happened the rainy night of feb. 26 , 2012 , when he spotted @entity4 inside a gated community in the central @entity13 town of @entity104			1
@entity3 called police , saying he believed @entity4 was suspicious and noted that there had been break - ins in the neighborhood			0
but @entity4 was a guest in the home of his father 's fiance , who lived inside the gated community , and was returning from a nearby convenience store with a snack in preparation for watching the @entity117 all - star game			0
mr @entity73 tried to undermine @entity3 's claim that he was not following @entity4 but looking for a street address to relay to police			1
the prosecutor sought to reveal inconsistencies in @entity3 's statements and repeatedly quoted him speaking in police jargon			1
pointing at @entity3 , who was seated at the defense table , de la @entity73 asked the jury to use common sense to answer the question : ' do you believe there 's an innocent man sitting over there ? ' ' who started this ? ' he asked			2
' who followed who ? who was minding his own business ? and of the two , who was armed ? ' mr @entity73 avoided mentioning race but said @entity3 ' profiled ' @entity4 , suggesting he assumed @entity4 was a criminal because he was black			0
if convicted , @entity3 could be sentenced to life in prison for second - degree murder and up to 30 years for manslaughter .			0
