by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 11:56 est , 13 march 2014 @entity2 has issued a list of 50 names new parents are banned from giving their children , including @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
the @entity13 nation 's interior ministry justified the ban by saying the names either contradicted the culture or religion of the kingdom , or were foreign , or ' inappropriate '			1
among the others are @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and @entity23 , the arabic name for @entity23			1
international fashion model @entity25 would not be able to name a child after herself in @entity2 under new rules @entity30 's late wife @entity29 , pictured here with her range of vegetarian food in 1991 , would have been frowned at by the authorities in @entity2 because of her name the names fit into at least three categories : those that offend perceived religious sensibilities , those that are affiliated to royalty and those that are of non-arabic or @entity47 origin , @entity36 reported			0
a number of other names appear that do not necessarily fit into any category and it is therefore unclear as to why they would have been banned			2
names such as @entity54 and @entity23 are not found to be particularly offensive to @entity55			1
@entity23 is believed in @entity55 to be the son of @entity57 ( @entity58 ) and the full brother of @entity60 , but it also happens to be the name of the @entity63 prime minister			1
@entity54 , similarly , is the name of the famous @entity13 nationalist ruler of @entity66 , who was at odds with @entity2			0
names such as @entity69 and @entity70 , common among @entity71 and some @entity72 , are controversial because of the multiple ways in which they can be interpreted			0
the name @entity23 has been banned , perhaps it is because it 's the first name of the @entity63 prime minister , @entity77 fans of the 1978 film grease would not be able to name their child after their favourite character if it was @entity9 , played here be @entity83 ( left )			1
@entity84 , played by @entity85 ( right ) , would be ok though royal visit : @entity2 's @entity87 , who has 38 children by many wives , is pictured with the @entity90 in @entity91 in 2007			0
his country has no problem with the name @entity95 @entity54 in @entity98 means ' worshipper of ' or ' slave of ' , while @entity69 means ' prophet ' and @entity101 means ' messenger '			0
those who oppose such names argue that @entity54 means ' worshipper of ' and is therefore forbidden as only @entity106 can be worshipped			0
most @entity108 names with @entity54 carry one of @entity106 's 99 @entity55 names			2
@entity112 , for example , comes from the name @entity114			0
another set of names that is banned includes those that have to do with royalty , especially titles such as @entity120 ( highness ) , @entity122 ( king ) and @entity124 ( @entity90 ) and other royal terms such as @entity126 ( the kingdom )			2
some of the names on the list are not uncommon among @entity72 , including @entity129 ( angel ) , @entity10 ( prince ) , @entity54 and @entity132 ( @entity133 )			0
@entity134 ( angel ) @entity136 @entity54 @entity137 @entity69 ( prophet ) @entity139 ( female prophet ) @entity10 ( prince ) @entity141 ( highness ) @entity126 ( the kingdom ) @entity124 ( queen ) @entity145 ( kingdom ) @entity147 ( blessed ) @entity148 @entity22 @entity7 @entity149 @entity150 ( utterance of the name of @entity106 ) @entity153 @entity154 @entity155 @entity156 @entity20 @entity9 @entity157 ( @entity158 god ) @entity159 @entity21 @entity160 @entity161 @entity162 @entity163 @entity8 @entity23 ( @entity98 for @entity23 ) @entity164 @entity165 @entity166 @entity167 @entity168 @entity169 @entity69 @entity101 @entity170 ( angel gabriel ) @entity172 @entity173 @entity174 @entity175 @entity176 @entity177			1
