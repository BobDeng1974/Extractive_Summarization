@entity0 was in the dugout recalling his heroics from that evening when , through a gap in the stands , he saw a coach drive off in the corner of his eye			1
the 33 - year - old was recounting , excitedly , the best night of his career ; his 100th appearance for @entity11 , a first game back from injury in two months , how he had thrown his hat in the ring for a penalty , saved two , then struck the decisive one as they knocked @entity18 out of the @entity19			1
halfway through speaking to the local press and club media after the game at @entity23 on tuesday night , he was sure it could not possibly be his team coach departing for the 70 - mile journey back			1
@entity11 goalkeeper @entity0 had to hitch a lift home after missing the team coach @entity0 scored the winning penalty for his side , but was left behind by the team bus after the game ' i could see through the corner of the stand a coach in the distance leaving , ' @entity0 recalls			1
' it was dark , but i could just make it out			0
i was still talking and in the back of my mind i thought , “ nah it ca n't be ours			2
” ' afterwards , @entity0 headed back to the changing room to find everyone and rejoin their celebrations which would continue on the coach back			1
but only those sorting out kit and equipment who travel in a separate transit van remained			0
he asked the club 's sports scientist @entity53 where everyone was			1
' his face dropped , ' @entity0 says , laughing			1
' he knew it had gone			0
he said he would call them back , if i was n't sorted they would 've come back , but i told him it 's fine i 'll get a lift			1
' you could n't knock me that night , if i had to walk back i would have done			2
' i was on cloud nine			0
i was buzzing , it 's one of those night 's in football you never forget			1
' it was a dream comeback for me			0
as a ' keeper you do n't get many times where you score the winner			0
' you 're there to save and you can only save what 's in front of you			2
for it to all work out that way was special			0
' @entity0 jumped into the back of a @entity79 with the club 's media officer @entity80 , club photographer @entity82 and @entity84 reporter @entity83			1
most of the team were part of a group message on @entity89 – they had all bought euromillions tickets for that night and used it to see if anyone had won – and @entity0 text them saying he could not believe he had been left behind			1
@entity0 celebrates a spot - kick save during @entity11 's penalty shooutout win against @entity18 @entity11 players rush to celebrate with their keeper before leaving him in @entity18 ' i got a lot of abuse from the boys , ' @entity0 explains			1
' everyone on there was laughing			0
i think some of the players stitched up our assistant manager @entity104 , it 's his job to count everyone on the bus			1
' i sit right at the back and maybe some of them told him i was already on there			2
' with all the jokes aside , @entity11 still had an internal investigation as to what went wrong , to make sure it does not happen again			2
the punishment , however , was not as serious			0
' the way we deal with things is we put the man on the centre spot at the training ground and balls are put all the way around the centre circle , ' @entity0 reveals			2
' then all the players pelt them at him			2
' @entity129 took a few off the lads			0
some of the culprits that stitched him up must 've got to do it ! it was a bit of fun			0
it 's all done and dusted			0
' although this is the first time @entity0 has been left behind by the team bus , it was not the first time he scored the winner in a penalty shoot - out			1
in a @entity146 match for @entity147 , away to @entity148 in 2006 , he saved one , saw another fly over the bar and stepped up , again , to bag the winner			0
' i 'm always up for taking penalties , ' he explains			0
' i strike the ball well			0
but they do n't come around much for a ' keeper , it depends who wants to take one			0
' that night , he managed to make it on the bus home			2
missing one will surely not happen again at @entity11 on @entity104 's watch			1
' he 'll make sure he walks up to the back of the coach next time and not trust the boys , ' @entity0 jokes .			1
