the average @entity1 has a one in nine chance of joining the wealthiest one per cent of the nation , study shows			1
about 11 per cent of workers in the @entity1 will move into the top one per cent of income earners for at least a year sometime between the ages of 25 and 60			1
this could mean that there 's more income mobility in @entity1 than one might think - at least in the top tiers if income earners			2
the higher a person is on the income ladder , the more income fluidity he or she has , a study shows			1
one in nine @entity1 has the chance of joining the wealthiest one per cent at some point in their lifetime ( file photo ) for those in the top five and ten per cent of the wealthiest in the nation , there 's more fluidity between the 99 and one per cent , according to a study done by professors @entity29 of @entity30 and @entity31 of @entity32			1
the researchers found that by the age of 60 , 70 percent will spend at least a year in the top 20 percent of earners and 53 percent will spend at least a year in the top 10 percent			0
additionally , 36 percent will spend at least a year in the top five percent and 11 percent will spend at least a year in the top one percent			0
indicators for top - level wealth included , education , marriage , race , age and disability status			0
race appears to be a dominant factor ( file photo ) as of 2012 , those who had an adjusted gross income of $ 434,682 were in the top one per cent of income earners , according to @entity50			1
but when they looked at the demographic of @entity1 who are more likely to float around in the upper levels of income , findings are less surprising			1
they found they are mostly older , white , married , educated for more than 12 years and lacking any work disability			1
of those who made it to the top one per cent , however , only 1.6 per cent stayed for five consecutive years and only .06 per cent stayed for more than ten years			0
and as the level of income gets lower down the ladder , fluidity seems to remain - of those in the top 20 per cent of earners , the odds of staying at that level for more than a decade is just one in five , research showed			2
' income fluidity is a double - edged sword , ' the authors wrote , ' creating opportunity for many , along with insecurity that this opportunity may end sooner than hoped for			2
' the strongest indicators of top - level wealth are education , marriage and race			0
the researchers found race such a dominant factor that it ' suggests persisting patterns of social inequality related to past and present discrimination and exclusion '			0
' thus it would be misguided to presume that top - level income attainment is solely a function of hard work , diligence , and equality of opportunity , ' they wrote			0
other studies have shown that there is less income mobility at lower wealth levels			0
once study found that for fathers in the bottom 20 per cent of earners , 42 per cent of their sons remain at the low levels .			2

eleven per cent of @entity1 workers will move into top one per cent of earners
the higher on the income ladder , the more income fluidity , study shows
in 2012 those with $ 434,682 adjusted gross income were in top one per cent
those more likely to float around upper levels of income are white , older , married , educated for more than 12 years and lacking work disabilities
