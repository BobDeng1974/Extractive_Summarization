published : 04:16 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 10:03 est , 18 june 2013 these before and after shots from across the capital are a stark reminder of how the @entity4 property market operates within its own bubble			1
the dilapidated remains of theatres and hospitals , shown here in the boom years prior to the 2008 financial crash are a stark contrast to the regenerated scenes which have sprung - up during the recession			1
investors have breathed new life into some of @entity4 's hidden heritage while this week , average house prices in @entity4 rocketed past the half a million mark to reach £ 515,243 , according to @entity22			1
this is supported by further government investment in the city			0
in august 2011 , the @entity26 announced a total of £ 120million in funds to further regenerate the city , in the wake of devastating riots			2
before : the @entity34 , @entity35 , pictured in 2008 , no longer in use , and after : refurbished in 2013 , the water tower of the hospital has now been converted into apartments , while some of the remaining hospital is still used for care services before : looking in a state of disrepair , part of the @entity34 , in @entity35 , @entity4 , was derelict and overgrown in 2008 after : @entity43 , the former @entity34 buildings have been replaced with apartments , pictured this year in august 2008 - just before the financial crash and around the time of many of these ' before ' shots - the average asking price for a house in @entity4 was £ 379,162			1
today 's prices are a staggering 36 per cent higher			0
in the 12 months to april 2013 @entity54 house prices increased by 2.6 % ; annual house price increases in @entity56 were driven by a 6.0 % rise in @entity4			1
excluding @entity4 and the @entity59 , however , @entity54 house prices increased by just 1.4 % in the 12 months to april 2013			1
before : @entity60 , a @entity62 mansion house in @entity63 , pictured in 2003 , disused , boarded up , covered in graffiti and looking unhappy after : restored to its former glory and now surrounded by new developments , the @entity62 mansion house is a reminder of bygone years in @entity63 @entity4 's regeneration since the financial crisis is clear from its skyline			1
the @entity72 , in @entity73 opened recently to wealthy investors ; ten properties within the soaring glass building are expected to fetch between £ 30million and £ 50million each			2
while in the east of the city , the former @entity78 buildings have been snapped up by businesses , adding value to the local east end area			0
foreign investment has largely been blamed for the inflated housing market in the capital			2
a recent report by estate agent network @entity88 revealed as much as 85 per cent of prime @entity4 property purchases last year were made with overseas money ; just 15 per cent of its sales in the past year were made by @entity54 buyers			1
of the foreign purchases , 80 per cent were from @entity96 and 20 per cent from @entity97 , @entity88 said			0
photographer @entity98 , 45 , embarked on the task of capturing images of decaying buildings ahead of their regeneration to give an insight into the less celebrated buildings across the city			0
before : a few years ago the @entity107 pub , in @entity108 , south @entity4 , closed down and became boarded up - pictured in 2009 after : the @entity107 pub , in @entity108 , has now been transformed into a @entity111 bookies , pictured this year the ten - year project , called @entity113 , has now amassed a collection of more than 2,500 images which illustrate @entity4 - for better and worse			1
@entity98 , from @entity116 , @entity4 , said : ' around ten years ago as i was walking through @entity4 i wished that i had a camera with me to snap a few of @entity4 's less celebrated buildings that were unlikely to be around much longer			1
' from then on i started wandering around every bit of the city , often walking 15 miles a day just capturing images of decay before regeneration takes place			0
before : another of @entity4 's pubs , the @entity127 , in @entity128 , by @entity129 , pictured decaying and boarded up in 2007 after : a distant memory , the @entity127 is no more , replaced by a block of flats , pictured this year before : the @entity134 , in @entity135 , in 2008 , looked in need of some love and attention			1
after : still a drinking house , the @entity141 venue is a well known landmark in central @entity135 before : the @entity143 , once a hive of creative activity , pictured in 2005 after : the east @entity4 theatre has gone for good , replaced with a development of 553 new homes , pictured in 2012 ' these places all have history not for the picture - postcard hunting tourists but were important to people in their heyday , whether it be their home , factory , local greasy spoon , pub , pool , hospital			1
' sometimes they are restored and converted into alternative use , whilst still retaining some of their former glory whilst others are demolished and replaced by flats and many people move in without being aware of what was on the site beforehand			0
' @entity98 , a former gig promoter , tasked himself with going for long walks without maps or directions to see what interesting subjects he would stumble upon in unlikely places			0
from then , he researched the history of the spots in local archives and libraries and got to work			0
before : the @entity179 , in @entity180 , which cost about £ 100,000 , was opened in 1921 and included a theatre , swimming - bath , gymnasium , and sports ground			2
it was successful until the wars , and was closed and sold in 1956 after : in the 1970s the building was part used as offices and in 2010 , the interior and rear was demolished , the facade restored and modernised , and the rest converted into apartments before : the @entity196 pub in @entity197 , @entity4 , pictured in 2008 as a sad and closed down former hang - out after : recognising it 's charm , new owners have spruced and brightened up the building , even retaining its original name - pictured this year his extraordinary repertoire of images includes decaying houses on the @entity209 , the faded glory of the @entity211 in @entity212 , @entity213 and the @entity214			1
the project has been so successful he not only runs guided tours but he has also created a book of his work			2
@entity98 added : ' when i started i wondered if anyone else would ever be interested in dereliction too			0
i thought everyone considered these places as eyesores			0
before : @entity226 , in @entity227 , @entity4 , has been offering its services to bereaved families for 150 years before it eventually closed down after : there is little to suggest this development , pictured in 2013 , was a former funeral directors ' but the response has been amazing			2
many people emailed me requesting me to show them around and as a result i run guided tours on most saturday afternoons			0
the demand for these walks has been phenomenal			0
before : the @entity4 @entity241 , in @entity4 's @entity240 , looked more of a crumbling eyesore in 2007 , than a sign of former evocative times bygone years : empty , boarded and gated up , the former hotel was once a well - known landmark for @entity4 residents prominent : the hotel , pictured in 2007 , once sat on the junction of a main roundabout in @entity240 and @entity251 after : now , nothing remains of the vast hotel which once provided rooms for hundreds of @entity4 visitors last century prime real estate : the site of the former @entity4 @entity241 now lies empty ( pictured in 2012 ) with just the trees remaining ' @entity113 is more of a living history and something to engage the public - all members of the public including the average person in the street			1
judging by mail i receive , it appeals to everybody : shop workers , musicians , footie fans , war vets , vicars , publicans and expats			0
' it certainly shows the relationships between humans and their physical and social environments , and the detrimental effects of modern society on the environment			0
' driving the market : latest figures , published by the @entity285 , show that @entity4 and the @entity59 continue to see the largest increases in property values compared to other regions of the @entity54			2

ten - year photography project shows how *pockets* of @entity4 seem *untouched* by the financial crash and have been regenerated
average house price in the capital has rocketed past £ *500,000*
