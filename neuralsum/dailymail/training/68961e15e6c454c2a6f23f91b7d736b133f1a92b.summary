@entity0 has said he will not cheat his way to the @entity3 title in @entity4 on sunday			1
the @entity6 driver , who is aiming to win his second world title ahead of fierce rival @entity8 , promised not to sully the season finale with a scurrilous act			1
asked if he would stage a crash , he said : ‘ have i crashed all year ? i ’m pretty good at what i do			0
why would i crash ? ’ the pair will have the freedom to race without orders from @entity6			2
so , with a 17 - point lead over @entity8 , @entity0 would potentially benefit if he took him out			1
but he said of crashing : ‘ that ’s not me			0
i want to win by winning			0
i ’ve never raced that way			0
’ @entity0 completed a practice double on friday as his bid to win a second formula one world championship got off to the best - possible start			1
@entity0 topped the timesheets in both practice sessions at the @entity26 on friday @entity0 is 17 points ahead of @entity6 team - mate @entity8 with just one race of the season remaining 1			1
@entity0 - 334 points 2			2
@entity8 - 317 points @entity0 will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season - ending @entity33 , even if @entity8 wins the race			1
if the final race was a ‘ normal ’ race with 25 points for the winner , rather than the double points on offer , @entity0 would be able to claim his second drivers ’ title with a sixth - place finish			1
after topping the timesheets in the opening session , @entity0 was against fastest under the lights in @entity4			1
@entity0 was only 0.083 seconds ahead of title rival @entity8 , who knows he must win this weekend to stand any chance of snatching the title from his @entity6 team - mate			1
' i got the whole session which was great , but there is still time to find , ' said @entity0			2
' it 's the same programme as each weekend and we are just chipping away at it			0
the team has done an awesome job			0
this is the best car i have had to drive round here			0
' i am going to do the best i can and so far i am making the right steps			0
' a top - two finish , regardless of the controversial double points on offer this weekend , will guarantee @entity0 the title			2
given @entity6 have scored one - twos in the last six races it would appear all that can stop @entity0 is either an accident or technical issue			2

@entity97 @entity96 in practice , @entity0 did all that was asked with @entity8 naturally second best , as not for the first time this campaign no - one could hold a candle to the dominant duo			1
at the conclusion of the first 90 - minute session , in particular , the margin from @entity106 to @entity96 's @entity97 in third was a staggering 1.7secs following soft - compound tyre runs			0
even @entity75 's @entity82 , potentially competing in the last race of his 15 - season career as his future remains in limbo with @entity75 not deciding on their driver line - up until after december 1 , found the situation amusing			2
with his car in the garage due to a technical fault , watching from the sidelines , @entity82 tweeted : ' great to see @ @entity122 have got a lot of competition here in @entity4 ! ! 1.7second gap ! ' with @entity128 's supersoft rubber given an outing in the second session the margin of dominance was at least narrowed			2
@entity0 finished a slender 0.083secs clear of @entity8 , with @entity76 in his @entity75 the best of the rest at nearly three quarters of a second off the pace			1
@entity78 's @entity77 , now confirmed as a @entity96 driver for next season , and @entity85 ' @entity79 , also managed to finish within a second of @entity0			1
@entity8 speaks to his wife @entity140 ahead of friday practice for the @entity33 bottas and team - mate @entity85 had earlier sat out most of @entity143 after the sidepod bodywork on the @entity146 's car had ripped off early in the session , whilst that on the @entity150 's car was found to be loose			1
bottas and @entity85 made up for lost time in @entity152 , with each completing 34 laps , although the latter was only 10th and 1.445secs off the pace			0
in between the pair were @entity78 's @entity80 , @entity81 in his @entity96 , with @entity82 eighth at least , albeit late on track given his earlier woes and managing only 23 laps , with @entity84 's @entity83 ninth			0
@entity97 's @entity96 is towed back to the paddock after he stopped on track with an electrical issue the @entity165 , who will join @entity75 next season , watches from the sidelines after his @entity96 stopped on track for @entity97 , from the relative high of third , the departing star who will return to @entity75 for next season , slumped to the low of 20th and last without a time to his name			0
due to an electrical problem with his car , @entity97 was forced to pull up in front of the @entity176 hotel that straddles the circuit			0
ahead of him were the @entity179 duo of @entity94 and debutant @entity180 in 18th and 19th respectively , the latter nearly five seconds behind fellow @entity182			0
the @entity184 - based team are back on the grid after being allowed to miss the last two races due to falling into administration			2
with the team in the shop window , 23 - year - old @entity188 racer @entity180 had to wait until 15 minutes from the end of @entity143 before finally savouring his first taste of @entity3 after encountering technical issues			0
@entity152 was more productive as he also completed 34 laps , and despite finishing 1.6secs behind team - mate @entity94 , can at least be relatively satisfied with his first day as a @entity3 driver			1
