for a moment , the image seemed wrong			2
celebrating in the corner were a group of giddy @entity4 players , while slumped in the penalty area were clutch of crestfallen @entity7			0
should n’t it be the other way around ? important matches between these two old foes tend to end one way and rarely is the outcome happy for @entity4			0
under - 21 head coach @entity14 , after all , knows that better than most			2
but this was no apparition : two goals in two minutes from @entity18 and @entity19 provided further evidence this squad @entity14 has impressively moulded is an emerging force			1
when @entity24 2015 starts 80 days from now , do not doubt they possess what it takes to win it			0
this 3 - 2 win at a rain sodden @entity30 , achieved after they had trailed twice , was stamped with the qualities of a team that can win a major tournament : quality , technique and spirit coming to the fore			1
never was it more evident than when @entity19 scored the decisive goal			1
@entity19 wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner in @entity4 under 21 's 3 - 2 defeat of @entity45 the @entity47 midfielder completed an unlikely comeback that saw two late goals scored in the space of three minutes @entity18 leaps for joy after bringing @entity4 level at 2 - 2 with a deflected shot in the second half @entity4 were heading towards defeat before @entity18 's strike on 79minutes brought them back into the game @entity59 brought @entity4 level for the first time with a composed finish from @entity63 's cross in the first half @entity45 striker @entity65 scored a brace but could not prevent the @entity67 from a memorable victory @entity65 slides in in front of @entity72 defender @entity70 to restore @entity45 's lead at the start of the second half @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity75 6.5 : @entity63 7.5 , @entity76 7 , @entity77 6.5 ( @entity79 77mins ) , @entity80 6.5 : @entity81 7.5 , @entity82 7 : @entity83 7.5 , @entity84 6.5 ( @entity85 65mins 6 ) , @entity18 8 : @entity86 7 subs not used : @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90			1
scorers : @entity83 34 , @entity18 79 , @entity92 82			1
@entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity93 7 : @entity94 6.5 , @entity95 7 , @entity96 6.5 , @entity97 6.5 : can 7 , @entity99 6 ( @entity100 46mins 6 ) , @entity98 6 : @entity101 6 ( @entity102 46mins 7 ) , @entity65 7.5 , @entity103 6.5 ( @entity104 68mins ) subs not used : @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111			1

man of the match : @entity63			1
referee : @entity116 ( @entity117 ) 7			0
expectations of a bold show in the @entity120 can now build but @entity14 , who has only lost one of the 16 games for which he has been in charge , was rather more circumspect			0
yes , he was pleased but he was also quick to sound a note of caution			0
‘ how do i keep a check on expectations , ’ he asked			0
i ’ll just show people the first 25 minutes of this game			0
we have tremendous belief in this group of players and some elements of what they did really pleased me			0
other aspects showed we can definitely improve			0
’ the last time @entity14 had stood in the technical area of this particular stadium , it came before one of the darkest moments of his career : the events of october 20 , 2009 , when he was sacked by @entity145 , will never leave him			0
he returned , however , a more confident and mature manager and he has thrived in this role with the @entity148 , getting the under - 21s playing a vibrant , attractive brand of football that will see them go to the @entity120 with genuine ambitions of success			2
@entity45 , though , will go there with the same mind - set and there is no doubt they will be big players when the tournament starts because of the big players they have in their ranks ; @entity93 , the @entity163 keeper , @entity166 of @entity164 and @entity103 of @entity165 to name but three			1
they started this contest impressively , moving the ball with purpose and ambition and in the first 10 minutes @entity4 had trouble getting out of their own half			0
@entity45 retained possession with ease and there was an inevitability they would strike first			2
when @entity45 broke the deadlock , they did it in style			2
@entity95 skipper down the left and clipped in a cross that @entity65 , celebrating his 22nd birthday , controlled with his right foot before smashing a drive beyond @entity75 with his left			1
for a moment it seemed like @entity45 might go through the gears but this @entity4 team has spirit as well as ability and their speed caused problems ; @entity83 ( twice ) and @entity86 both tested @entity93 before @entity83 ’s industry was rewarded in the 34th minute and parity was restored			1
half - time arrived and checked @entity4 ’s momentum			2
@entity45 made changes and the introduction of @entity205 flyer @entity102 gave them blistering pace and trickery to attack @entity72 left - bacl @entity80			1
he made an immediate impact , thrilling providing @entity65 ’s second of the night			2
yet @entity4 were not done and they staged a grandstand comeback , @entity18 equalised in the 78th minute before @entity92 won it when bursting through			1
the players , then , can start to dream and , perhaps in a quiet moment , @entity14 will too			0
‘ we have not achieved anything yet , ’ he said			0
‘ we know what our goal is and we want to get there			0
’ @entity219 , who plays in @entity45 's second division , strikes to open the scoring for @entity45 after 15minutes the @entity45 striker wheels away in celebration after handing the visitors the lead in this international friendly @entity45 players celebrate after opening the scoring , but left the @entity30 in shock after @entity4 's comeback victory @entity164 and @entity45 midfielder / defender @entity166 ( right ) slides in for a tackle on @entity4 's @entity235 @entity4 under 21 manager @entity14 looks on at the stadium where he spent his career as a player and manager @entity83 watches his composed finish find the net after meeting a right wing pass from @entity63 the @entity244 forward races off to celebrate his first goal for @entity4 's @entity246 21s @entity4 team - mates race to congratulate @entity83 for bringing them level while fans rise from their seats @entity251 forward @entity86 embraces @entity83 as the two teams head in level at half time @entity164 target @entity86 tries to take the ball under control as @entity4 start to get back into the game @entity219 takes advantage of an @entity4 lapse of concentration after the break to net his second goal @entity265 forward @entity84 strolls forward with the ball from midfield as @entity4 withstand pressure @entity4 's perseverance paid off when @entity18 brought the sides level for a second time with a deflected shot the @entity274 forward can not contain his pleasure as he celebrates his equaliser in front of @entity4 fans @entity19 netted @entity4 's winner within three minutes of drawing level in the closing stages the @entity4 under 21 captain shows his joy as the @entity67 chalk up a memorable victory against the old enemy			1
