water inside the @entity2 ’s mantle came from primitive meteorites - the same source thought to have supplied most of the water on @entity6 , according to new research			1
the findings , from an analysis of lunar rocks brought back by @entity12 astronauts , raise new questions about the process that formed the @entity2			1
the @entity2 is thought to have formed from a disc of debris left when a giant object hit the @entity6 4.5 billion years ago , very early in @entity6 ’s history			1
imported water : scientists believe water found on the @entity2 is the same as here on @entity6 the latest results come from studies samples returned from the moon , including green - tinged stone collected by @entity27 in 1971 , and orange material gathered by @entity29 in 1972			1
the surprise discovery of the green rock , by commander @entity32 and lunar module pilot @entity33 , sparked a lengthy debate among the astronauts about the boulder 's true colour while @entity39 controllers listened in			2
scientists have long assumed that the heat from an impact of that size would cause hydrogen and other volatile elements to boil off into space , meaning the @entity2 must have started off completely dry			0
but recently , @entity39 spacecraft and new research on samples from the @entity51 missions have shown that the @entity2 actually has water , both on its surface and beneath			1
by showing that water on the @entity2 and on @entity6 came from the same source , this new study offers yet more evidence that the @entity2 ’s water has been there all along			1
' the simplest explanation for what we found is that there was water on the @entity6 at the time of the giant impact , ' said @entity66 , associate professor of geological sciences at @entity68 and the study ’s lead author			2
' some of that water survived the impact , and that ’s what we see in the @entity2			2
' to find the origin of the @entity2 ’s water , @entity66 and his colleagues looked at melt inclusions found in samples brought back from the @entity51 missions			1
debate still rages over exactly how the moon was formed			0
according to the leading theory , the moon was formed about 4.5bn years ago , from a hot cloud of debris that was knocked into space when a planet the size of @entity88 slammed into @entity6			0
astronomers have carried out numerous simulations of the impact event , and many believe it to be the most likely explanation			0
the latest findings suggest the @entity6 was already damp at the time the moon was created			0
' the simplest explanation for what we found is that there was water on the @entity6 at the time of the giant impact , ' said @entity66 , associate professor of geological sciences at @entity68 and the study ’s lead author			2
' some of that water survived the impact , and that ’s what we see in the @entity2			2
melt inclusions are tiny dots of volcanic glass trapped within crystals called olivine			0
the crystals prevent water escaping during an eruption and enable researchers to get an idea of what the inside of the @entity2 is like			2
research from 2011 found that the melt inclusions have plenty of water — as much water in fact as lavas forming on the @entity6 ’s ocean floor			2
this study aimed to find the origin of that water			0
comets , like meteorites , are known to carry water and other volatiles , but most comets formed in the far reaches of the solar system in a formation called the @entity140			0
because they formed so far from the sun , they tend to have high deuterium / hydrogen ratios — much higher ratios than in the @entity2 ’s interior , where the samples in this study came from			0
backscatter electron image of a lunar melt inclusion from an @entity29 sample ' the measurements themselves were very difficult , ' @entity151 said , ' but the new data provide the best evidence yet that the carbon - bearing chondrites were a common source for the volatiles in the @entity6 and @entity2 , and perhaps the entire inner solar system			1
' recent research , @entity66 said , has found that as much as 98 percent of the water on @entity6 also comes from primitive meteorites , suggesting a common source for water on @entity6 and water on @entity2			1
the easiest way to explain that , @entity66 says , is that the water was already present on the early @entity6 and was transferred to the @entity2			1
the finding is not necessarily inconsistent with the idea that the @entity2 was formed by a giant impact with the early @entity6 , but presents a problem			1
if the @entity2 is made from material that came from the @entity6 , it makes sense that the water in both would share a common source			1
however , the team say there is still the question of how that water was able to survive such a violent collision			0
' the impact somehow did n’t cause all the water to be lost , ' @entity66 said			0
' but we do n’t know what that process would be			0
' it suggests , the researchers say , that there are some important processes we do n’t yet understand about how planets and satellites are formed .			0

@entity2 rocks brought home by @entity12 astronauts contain *droplets* of water *chemically* identical to those on @entity6
@entity202 may change our understanding of the @entity2 's formation
