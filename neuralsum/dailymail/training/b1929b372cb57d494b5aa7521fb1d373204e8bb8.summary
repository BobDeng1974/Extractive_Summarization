by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:42 est , 10 february 2014 the debate about whether video games can encourage violence is nothing new			1
and now a study suggests that people who play video games from a villain ’s perspective , become a little bit meaner in the real world			1
how gamers represent themselves in the virtual world of video games may affect how they behave toward others in the real world , @entity15 researchers have warned			1
a new study suggests that people who play video games from a villain 's perspective , become a little bit meaner in the real world			1
students took on the role of @entity29 ( pictured centre ) - the main baddie in @entity32 - to contribute to the findings in the experiment , gamers who played as either heroes , villains or a neutral character were asked to dish out either chocolate or chilli sauce to another blindfolded student to eat			1
those who played as @entity42 poured on average nearly twice as much chocolate as chilli sauce for an unknown student to consume			0
the researchers also discovered that the gamers who played as a hero poured significantly more chocolate than those who played as either of the other avatars , perhaps suggesting that they became more generous			2
however , participants who played as @entity29 the villain poured out nearly twice as much of the spicy chilli sauce than they did chocolate , suggesting their desire to inflict discomfort on other participants of the experiment			1
they also poured significantly more chilli sauce for students to consume compared to the other participants , the scientists said			0
@entity65 , a researcher from the @entity66 at @entity66 , said : ‘ our results indicate that just five minutes of role - play in virtual environments as either a hero or villain can easily cause people to reward or punish anonymous strangers			1
’ the conducted a novel blind taste test experiment to come to their conclusion			0
he and @entity78 , another co-author of the study , which as published in @entity81 , a journal of the @entity83 , explained that virtual environments afford people the opportunity to take on identities and experience circumstances that they otherwise ca n't in real life , providing ‘ a vehicle for observation , imitation , and modelling			2
’ they recruited 194 undergraduates to explore whether the experiences of taking on heroic or villainous avatars might carry over into everyday behaviour			2
students were randomly assigned to play as @entity42 ( a heroic avatar ) , @entity29 ( a villainous avatar ) , or a circle ( a neutral avatar )			1
they played a videogame for five minutes in which they , as their avatars , were tasked with fighting enemies			0
the results of the experiment indicate that just five minutes of role - play in virtual environments as either a hero , such as @entity42 ( pictured ) or villain can easily cause people to reward or punish anonymous strangers the students then participated in a blind taste test and were asked to give either chocolate or chilli sauce to another student			1
they were told to pour the chosen food item into a plastic dish and that the future participant would consume all of the food provided			0
those who played as @entity42 poured on average nearly twice as much chocolate as chilli sauce for an unknown student to consume			0
the researchers also discovered that the gamers who played as a hero poured significantly more chocolate than those who played as either of the other avatars			2
however , participants who played as @entity29 the villain poured out nearly twice as much of the spicy chilli sauce than they did chocolate , suggesting their desire to inflict discomfort on other participants of the experiment			1
they also poured significantly more chilli sauce for students to consume compared to the other participants , the scientists said			0
student who played a video game as heroes dished out nearly twice as much chocolate ( left ) as chilli sauce ( right ) for unknown students to consume , indicating the desire to do good rubbed off on them , while those that played as villains were more likely to punish blindfolded experiment participants by feeding the chilli sauce a second experiment with 125 undergraduates confirmed the findings and showed that playing as an avatar yielded stronger effects on subsequent behaviour than just watching someone else play as the avatar			1
but interestingly , the degree to which participants actually identified with their avatar did n't seem to make a difference			0
‘ these behaviours occur despite modest , equivalent levels of self - reported identification with heroic and villainous avatars , alike , ’ the researchers wrote			2
‘ people are prone to be unaware of the influence of their virtual representations on their behavioural responses			0
’ they think that how involved or ' keyed into ' the game players are , might be an important factor driving the behavioural effects they observed			0
‘ in virtual environments , people can freely choose avatars that allow them to opt into or opt out of a certain entity , group , or situation , ’ dr @entity65 said			0
‘ consumers and practitioners should remember that powerful imitative effects can occur when people put on virtual masks			0

gamers that adopted villainous @entity29 as an avatar , were more likely to dish out a punishment in the experiment
@entity66 at @entity66 researchers found that people who played games as a heroic character were more likely to reward others
they warned that how gamers represent themselves in the virtual world of video games may affect how they behave toward others in the real world
