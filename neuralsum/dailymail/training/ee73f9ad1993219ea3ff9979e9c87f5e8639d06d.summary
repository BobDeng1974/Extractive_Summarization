by @entity0 published : 13:30 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 17:48 est , 28 march 2013 trapped in a sinking car , your commanding officer , @entity4 - whose leg is uncompromisingly wedged in the wreckage - passes you his gun and orders you to shoot out the window			1
the windscreen starts to crack as the pressure increases			0
your other two comrades are screaming at you to ignore his pleas but you know what must be done			0
raising the weapon , you fire before the screen goes black			0
life - like : @entity20 says that the frostbite 3 engine allows for more realistic animations and the level of detail is some of the best we 've seen			1
this is to complement a much more emotional story welcome to @entity28			2
or , as the gameplay demonstration would have us believe , medal of duty : @entity33 , although absolutely stunning to look at , it was impossible to ignore both @entity34 's and the ( late ) @entity36 ' influence on @entity28 's level structure and gameplay			1
namely , the frequent set - pieces ( which sees helicopters explode in slow - motion , car chases , more helicopters exploding ) , the soundtrack , the @entity52 talent ( none other than @entity46 's @entity45 ) and an overarching emphasis on developing bonds with your team - mates			1
no matter , as @entity34 is a proven winning formula			2
in @entity28 , based in the same universe as its predecessor , you play @entity60 - part of the @entity62 squad			2
the demo , which showed off the game 's prologue , sees the team in @entity67 , trying to escape while under fire from @entity70 soldiers			0
immediately evident are the environments , which art director @entity72 calls an ' agresssive world '			0
interestingly , the overall look has been inspired by car adverts - creating bright , dynamic worlds that contrast with the dark subject matter			2
everything in the environment reacts to each other , too			0
the @entity83 engine allows particles , foliage and cloth to be affected by explosions as well as standard - fare destructive environments			1
aggressive world : interestingly , the art director has said that car adverts inspired the overall look of the game			2
the entire demo had a @entity52 sheen which made the battlegrounds look more inviting thankfully , unlike in @entity99 , the single - player makes the most out of these			1
you can use explosions to create new paths , then use the new ' designate target ' function and get your team to cover your flanking maneuver			0
@entity20 have made it clear that multiplayer has had a huge impact on the single - player campaign - offering the freedom of movement and choice many thought was missing from the previous game			1
also improved are the vehicle sections			0
the demo saw the player driving two cars - a 4x4 and armed buggy ( although the lack of animation when both entering the car and using the on - board turret was less than impressive ) , while the teaser trailer clearly showed you in control of a dinghy alongside a large aircraft carrier			1
unfortunately , the 17 - minute demo footage was most likely using a high - powered pc so if the game was to arrive on current gen , visuals will look noticeably worse			1
there is no date penned for release although it is expected to arrive at the end of the year			0
see the battlefield 4 gameplay for yourself : follow us on @entity143 : @ @entity144 and on @entity145 : @entity146 .			0

slow motion , explosions , car chases - all similar to @entity34 series
no word if game will be on current gen , although it looks likely
frostbite 3 engine is more ' *refined* than its predecessor ' not a complete overhaul
promises to be much more open than @entity99 , with an emotional single - player campaign
