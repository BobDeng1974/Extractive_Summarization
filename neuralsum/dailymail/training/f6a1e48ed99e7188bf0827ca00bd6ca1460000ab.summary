a magnificent great white shark leaps from the water to take a chunk out of what it believes to be a seal			1
these amazing full breaches were conceived using a plastic seal decoy , dragged behind a tourist diving boat , as a way of enticing the hungry predator			2
shot by filmmaker @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , the footage demonstrates the frightening power and agility of the iconic shark			1
the close - up footage demonstrates the frightening power and agility of the iconic man - eater as it swoops on what it thinks is dinner the great white shark twists and turns in mid-air as it toys with its prey in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity30 but achieving such incredible shots is only possible if the conditions are right			1
he said : ' we filmed just before and just after sunrise , as this is the most active time for the sharks to hunt			0
' during this time the seals and our seal decoy form a good silhouette for the sharks to target , but the water is still very dark , making it very difficult for the seals to spot the predators			1
the bait is dragged behind a tourist diving boat , as a way of enticing the hungry predator into action the stunning video was shot by filmmaker @entity12 who had to be on his toes to capture the action , which can be over in an instant ' this gives the sharks a big advantage during these hours			1
' on a good morning you can get anywhere from one to six breaches on the decoy - this is obviously dependent on many factors such as sea conditions , weather and seal activity in the water			1

there have been occasions when the boat has pulled the decoy for close to an hour with no breaches			2
' but you dare not take your eye off your viewfinder and the decoy because that is always when it happens			0

' it is much too quick to be able to pick up the camera and record			0
by that time it is all over			0
