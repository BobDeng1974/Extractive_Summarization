by @entity0 for the @entity1 for @entity7 's @entity6 captain @entity5 , choosing his three wild card selections for the match at @entity4 later this month proved an exercise in the three @entity9 there was romance in opting for @entity12 to make his cup debut at a venue just 30 or so miles from his home in @entity16			1
there was @entity18 , the racing certainty			1
then came cold reality , and the agonising decision of having to choose between @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity5 was standing next to him as his foursomes partner when @entity22 almost died of stage fright on his debut at @entity27 in 2004			1
' he was just besotted with nerves for the first six holes , ' he said			0
the @entity49 has been there every step of the way , watching the @entity53 grow into one of the finest @entity6 players of all time			1
but still he felt he could n't pick him			0
' it was the shortest of short heads between @entity23 and @entity22 , ' confirmed @entity5			1
' but in august at the @entity61 and the @entity62 we saw a little flourish of form from @entity23 that @entity22 was not able to show			1
there were no green shoots of form from him and that proved the difference			0
' sometimes you shake your head in amazement on these occasions but @entity5 is such a clear thinker that even if you disagreed with any of his choices you had to respect the sound logic			1
forget the red herring that he would be hidebound by statistics			0
' these selections were primarily about a captain 's instincts , ' he said , which is as it should be			0
at the press conference at @entity83 , the excitement felt by @entity12 , even down a crackly phone line , was plain			1
' i 've been dreaming about playing in the @entity6 all my days , ' said the 39 - year - old @entity87 , and given the identity of his uncle @entity89 — eight times a player , thrice captain — it might almost literally be true			1
video @entity5 announces wildcards missing pieces of the jigsaw : the three wildcard names are added to a board displaying @entity7 's team line - ups : the @entity35 wildcards are set to be revealed late on tuesday by @entity101 @entity5 's boys : the full @entity7 team to take on the @entity35 later this month video @entity18 's incredible story for : @entity12 's last five strokeplay results at @entity4 are : 2nd ( 2013 ) , 6th ( 2012 ) , 6th ( 2011 ) , 14th ( 2010 ) , 10th ( 2008 )			1
against : the @entity87 has never won a singles match in seven attempts at a major event			0
he has played in the @entity111 matchplay event , the @entity112 , the @entity113 , @entity114 and the @entity115			0
it was vital for the health of @entity7 golf that a player who went out to the @entity120 last week and came so close to the top two finish he needed to make the team automatically — he finished third — received his due			1
imagine if he had been overlooked ? what sort of message would that have sent out , going forward , to all those who loyally support the @entity127 ? after qualifying for the team in similar circumstances in 2004 , @entity5 ( below ) recognised that more than anyone			1
' picking @entity12 was an easy one , ' he said			2
' he showed me last week he deserved a place on this team			0
it was n't just the 65 he shot on sunday , the second best round of anyone on the day			0
on friday he stood 14 shots off the lead at one point but came home in 30 and showed exactly how much he wanted it			0
' let 's be clear			0
i have n't done @entity12 a favour by picking him			2
his performances demanded he be picked			0
' the other easy one was @entity18 , currently on a wondrous run of seven successive victories in @entity6 matches			1
' he 's always up for the @entity6 challenge , is n't he ? ' said @entity5 , smiling , and the @entity53 was only too willing to concur			1
' i made 24 birdies in the tournament last week and the encouraging thing for me is that i am starting to hole some putts again , ' said @entity18			2
' i 've got three weeks now and i can guarantee i will be ready			0
' then came the difficult bit			0
the pick that left a knot in @entity5 's stomach			2
the first call he made after making his mind up was to @entity22 , to get the worst bit out of the way			2
' he was desperately disappointed and i know the next time i see him in person it is going to be a very difficult conversation , ' said @entity5			2
the man to beat : @entity168 is the leading figure on the @entity7 team for @entity4 miracle at @entity172 : @entity7 's team celebrate their remarkable success in @entity175 in 2012 mr @entity6 : @entity18 has an incredible record in the event and was never likely to be left out ' let 's not get it out of perspective			1
there are much harder things to take in life than the @entity6			2
but in sporting terms it was the hardest phone call i have ever had to make			0
' the other thing that swung it @entity23 's way was his influence in the locker room , a fact recognised by the player himself			2
' i think i 've got more experience than most captains and if @entity5 wants me to practise with the rookies or talk to them or help in any way , almost like a playing vice-captain if you like , i 'm very happy to do that , ' he said			2
this will be @entity23 's ninth @entity6 — only sir @entity205 ( 11 ) , @entity206 and @entity207 ( both 10 ) have played more — and the pride he feels is obvious			1
this is only the second time he has been picked , and he recognised he will be under more pressure			0
but the man who admitted he lost his spark in july is sounding a lot more like his old , formidable self			0
the @entity6 can do that for a man			2
' the spark is definitely back , i 'm swinging the club a lot better and i 'm more focused , ' said @entity23 , who will add this week 's @entity220 to his schedule before the @entity6 to make sure he is acclimatised			1
the three selections complete a strong @entity7 team , led by current major winners @entity168 and @entity225			1
it wo n't be as easy at @entity4 as many think — the @entity35 are better than advertised — but the home side will deservedly start as clear favourites			0
