@entity2 @entity1 candidate @entity0 again refused to say whether she voted for @entity3 when asked about her voting history on monday night during a debate			1
@entity0 claimed there 's ' no reluctancy ' on her part to reveal her vote while asserting that she has a constitutional right not to answer questions about it			2
she then chided the debate moderator for having the audacity to violate the sanctity of the ballot box by pressuring her to reveal her vote			2
' this is a matter of principle			0
our @entity26 grants , here in @entity24 , the constitutional right for privacy at the ballot box , for a secret ballot , ' she told the debate 's moderator , @entity24 tonight host @entity28			1
@entity3 who ? : @entity24 democrat @entity0 again refused to say whether she voted for @entity3 in the last two elections when pressed to reveal her vote on monday night during a @entity1 debate ' you have that right , @entity37 [ @entity36 ] @entity35 has that right , every @entity24 has that right			1
and as secretary of state , the chief election official , i 'm tasked with overseeing and making sure that we 're enforcing all of our election laws and i 've worked very closely , especially with the members of our military to ensure that the privacy at the ballot box ... ' at that point @entity28 butted in to get clarification on her position			1
' so your reluctancy is a matter of principle ? ' he asked ? ' i am not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in @entity24 in order to curry favor on one or other side , or for members of the media			0
i 'll protect that right for every @entity24			0
' @entity28 again pressed @entity0 to say whether or not she voted for @entity3 , but she would n't budge			2
' again , you have that right , sen. @entity35 has that right , every @entity24 has the right for privacy at the ballot box			1
' if i as chief election official , @entity65 , do n't stand up for that right , who in @entity24 will ? ' she asked			0
@entity0 is competing in @entity24 's @entity1 race this fall against incumbent @entity35 , who also serves at the upper chamber 's minority leader			1
if @entity71 win a majority of seats in november , @entity35 will likely become the @entity1 majority leader			2
polls have @entity0 and @entity35 neck and neck and tonight was the pair 's only debate against each other before the election next month			0
@entity0 opponent , sitting sen. @entity83 , had no problem sharing his vote in both recent presidential elections during tonight 's debate			1
@entity35 said he voted for @entity89 sen. @entity88 in 2008 and former @entity91 gov. @entity90 in 2012			0
both men are republicans @entity0 has been loathe to tie herself to @entity3 in any way during the race , despite being a member of his political party , in order to boost her odds of getting elected in @entity24 , where the president is incredibly unpopular			1
@entity3 is less liked in @entity24 than almost anywhere in the country and has an approval rating of 29 percent there , according to a recent @entity105 poll			0
as such , @entity0 likes to say she 's a ' @entity106 , ' not an @entity3 @entity106 , and supports the policies of former president @entity108 and his wife @entity109 , a former @entity3 administration official			2
asked what the difference between a @entity108 @entity106 and an @entity3 @entity0 is at tonight 's debate , @entity0 explained it 's ' growing the middle class the right way and that 's by making sure that we are building from the foundation up			1
' at an editorial board meeting with the @entity120 declined to say whether she voted for @entity3 in 2008 or 2012 multiples times , arguing that her vote was irrelevant because the president 's name is not on the ballot			2
she also made the claim , as she did tonight , that she did n't need to share her vote with @entity127 because it 's private information			0
@entity0 ' vote is actually public information , assuming she was telling the truth in 2012 when she told a local newspaper that she planned to support her party 's nominee , @entity3 , though she is unwilling to admit that now			1
@entity35 , for one , had no problem sharing his vote in both recent presidential elections during tonight 's debate , without even being asked			0
the @entity71 leader said he voted for @entity89 sen. @entity88 in 2008 and former @entity91 gov. @entity90 in 2012			0
' and by the way , in 2012 , 116 out of 120 @entity24 counties agreed with my judgement that we might be in better shape now had @entity90 been elected , ' @entity35 added .			0

@entity0 is competing in @entity24 's @entity1 race against incumbent sen. @entity83 , a @entity71
@entity0 has been loathe to tie herself to @entity3 , despite being a member of his political party , because he is very unpopular in @entity24
in an interview last week , and again tonight , @entity0 refused to say whether she even voted for @entity3
