@entity3 and @entity4 were sacked by the club last season and the @entity35 club have sent a dossier to the @entity5 alleging misconduct			1
the statement said that @entity3 had been under pressure at the time of the messages and that he was ' letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			1
' reported : @entity3 ( right ) and @entity4 have been accused of being racist , sexist and homophobicin a series of text messages dating back to their time together at @entity7 exclusive : chief sports reporter @entity2 's story in thursday 's @entity53 click here to read @entity56 ' verdict on the controversial statement from the @entity12 elsewhere , former @entity26 striker @entity22 has described the @entity12 's statement as being ' f * * * * * * disgraceful '			1
he said on @entity15 : ' @entity12 statement			1
f * * * * * * disgraceful			0
institutional acceptance of the " banter " of casual racism			0
' he does feel @entity3 deserves a second chance , though , adding : ' always kind to me , hope he says sorry ( if true ) , and moves on			2
' another former player who has worked closely on eliminating discrimination , @entity56 , tweeted excerpts from the @entity12 's statement and then said : ' that 's it			1
. i 'm done for the evening			0
. the @entity12 said it better than i ever could			2
. they are actually being serious ! somebody drafted that			0
. @entity75 ! ' shock : former @entity77 striker @entity56 could n't believe the @entity12 's statement was serious opinion : former @entity81 and @entity82 striker @entity56 shares his views via @entity15 former @entity85 player and manager @entity84 has also had his say , revealing he 's disappointed with the @entity12 's use of the term ' banter '			1
he told the @entity91 : ' if the @entity12 are going back into the dark ages to support people then i might have to withdraw my support			0
' if @entity3 did use a couple of texts , as he admits to in the statement , then i 'm disappointed and i think it needs to be dealt with not as something swept over or as a bit of banter			1
' i know they ( @entity12 ) are trying to protect their member but in doing so i feel they are almost abusing another member , like myself			0
' the @entity12 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity3 ’s time at @entity7			1
in the course of a search by the @entity114 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity3 ’s employment at @entity7 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity121 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			2
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity3 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			2
that said , @entity3 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			0
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity5 process is complete			0
the @entity12 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity121 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			2
if @entity3 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity3 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity5 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity157			1
@entity121 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			2
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity121 ’s involvement in this matter			0
@entity3 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			0
@entity121 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity3 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity5 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter .			2
