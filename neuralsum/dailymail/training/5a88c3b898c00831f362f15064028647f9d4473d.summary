by @entity1 reporter published : 09:58 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 4 february 2013 @entity3 and @entity4 workers will go to other @entity6 countries when an immigration ban is relaxed at the beginning of next year , leading politicians from the two countries said today			1
@entity3 foreign minister @entity11 said many of his compatriots would much rather travel to @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , as his country has stronger business links with those countries			0
he said there was a danger that fears about thousands of immigrants descending on the @entity24 could ' dampen ' relations with @entity3			1
migration : @entity3 nationals queuing up outside the @entity28 in @entity29 for visa applications in 2006 @entity4 ambassador to the @entity24 , dr @entity32 , said many immigrants had already by - passed the restrictions by declaring themselves self - employed and finding jobs in sectors such as construction			1
the two men were interviewed by @entity39 on @entity40 amid fears that when the ban preventing immigrants from the two countries working in the @entity24 comes to an end at the beginning of next year , thousands will arrive and look for jobs			1
@entity3 and @entity4 joined the @entity48 in 2007 but under ' transitional arrangements ' workers from the two countries were prevented from travelling to the @entity24			1
mr @entity11 said the relaxing of the restrictions would not lead to a flood of immigrants coming here			0
he said : ' i do not expect the @entity24 to be overwhelmed by a wave of our nationals coming over seeking employment for a number of reasons			0
' when we look at the experience of other countries over the last seven years , this has not happened and there is no reason to believe that this would happen in the @entity24 in the january of next year			2
@entity3 foreign minister @entity11 said many of his compatriots would much rather travel to @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 ' we have not seen since @entity3 's accession to the @entity48 mass waves of @entity3 moving across @entity71 and seeking illegal rights or illegal immigration to other countries			1
' we had some issues in the first days after accession but in a number of cases we acted very swiftly and they were addressed , and so there were no lasting concerns			0
' the @entity24 would not be the primary country of choice for many people to go and work			0
our economy is mostly connected to the @entity14 economy			0
' we have a large number of companies working in places like @entity15 and @entity16 , where we have long - standing traditions and where the labour market had opened to @entity3 quite some time ago			2
' i really do n't believe that there is a need to have these fearful debates that are happening			0
' on the contrary , i think people in the @entity24 , given your history , must understand that immigration has always been beneficial to your economy , just as @entity24 's membership of the @entity48 has been beneficial to not only jobs creation but prosperity in your country			1
' meanwhile a diplomatic row has broken out after @entity24 made public last week plans to warn off @entity4 migrants			1
it emerged the government is considering launching a campaign in @entity4 and @entity3 to put people off coming to the @entity24			1
the ban preventing immigrants from @entity4 and @entity3 working in the @entity24 comes to an end at the beginning of next year			1
it is thought thousands will arrive looking for jobs but the @entity4 foreign minister has said restrictions on its citizens to work in the @entity24 has caused ' serious concern			1
' dr @entity32 said fears that many @entity4 would come to the @entity24 was a ' false problem '			2
he said : ' @entity4 ' immigration pattern is not towards the @entity24 but towards @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity128 , for instance because of the language proximity , @entity4 being a @entity132 language			2
' we have one million @entity4 already living and working in @entity15 , one million in @entity16 , probably half a million in @entity128			0
" he added : ' those @entity4 who have wanted to come to @entity24 , they have already done it			2
' there are some restrictions for some areas of activities but no visa requirements , so those who have wanted to come , they have done it			0
' it is always a possibility to find a job , even if it is under restrictions , and that solution is to declare yourself self - employed , and many @entity4 have done so			0
' for instance in the construction sector , there are many @entity4 here and that is why your @entity157 village was built up last year			0
' new data shows the proportion of people across who say @entity162 is not their main language ranging from 0.7 per cent in @entity164 and @entity165 to 41.4 per cent in @entity166 in @entity167			0
the breakdown from the 2011 national census also revealed the second most commonly spoken language in the country is now @entity172			0
@entity172 was virtually unheard on the streets of @entity24 a decade ago but its use has soared since the country joined the @entity48 in may 2004			1
the census figures show that other @entity6 languages are now in the list of the most popular , including @entity179 , spoken by 85,000 people , and @entity181 , first language of 32,000			0
