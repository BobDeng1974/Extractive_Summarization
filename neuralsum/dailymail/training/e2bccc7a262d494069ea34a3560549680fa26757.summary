dr @entity0 woke up in an awkward position			1
from then the slightest movement or touch caused pain as a gp , dr @entity0 is used to seeing people in pain - and as someone who 's suffered from it for years himself , he is particularly sympathetic			1
in his 20s he damaged a disc in his neck during a surfing accident , causing it to bulge or ' slip '			0
over the next 12 years , more of the discs in his neck became damaged , leaving him with chronic stinging pain in his back , arms and shoulders			1
but this was nothing compared with what came next			0
one day dr @entity0 woke up having slept in an awkward position			1
from then on the slightest movement of his right arm , or even being touched on his upper back , caused waves of excruciating pain			1
' the pain intensified over several months to the point where , having been able to carry on " as normal " for 12 years despite a series of slipped discs , i became unable to lift a stethoscope to listen to someone 's chest , ' explains dr @entity0 , 51 , who works at an @entity39 surgery in @entity40			1
' if anyone even gently brushed against my back i would get a jolt of incredible pain and my knees would buckle			2
' as well as the pain , his right hand became a mottled red colour			2
and , most remarkably , the nails and hair on his arm grew faster , as did the bones in his right hand - over months it grew bigger than his left hand			0
his doctor gave him prescriptions for painkillers , but this did nothing			0
' there appeared to be no answers as to why this had happened , ' says dr @entity0 , who lives in @entity67 , @entity40 , with wife , @entity68 , 48 , and their children aged 14 and 11			1
his doctor referred him to a neurosurgeon			0
' he treated me like a malingerer , ' recalls dr @entity0			1
' it was the most terrifying time of my life			0
' i could n't work and i feared i might never do so again at that point			0
my right arm , as well as being painful , began to lose its power			0
despite trying to keep it moving , it gradually lost strength and co-ordination , until four months later it just hung uselessly by my side			0
' i could do everyday things like write and eat with a knife and fork but it was extremely hard			0
my wife was pregnant with our second son and she did not need another dependent at this point			0
' six months after dr @entity0 's symptoms began , an osteopath suggested the problem might be shoulder - hand syndrome - a form of complex regional pain syndrome ( @entity98 )			1
suddenly dr @entity0 realised he had a diagnosis			1
@entity98 is a greater - than - normal reaction of the body to an injury , resulting in a ' scalding ' pain at the slightest touch			1
' the pain is so bad that it is not uncommon for people to say they want to have their affected limb amputated , ' says dr @entity108 , a senior lecturer in pain medicine at @entity111 syndrome usually affects just one limb , commonly the arm or leg			1
six months after his symptoms began , an osteopath suggested the problem might be shoulder - hand syndrome as well as pain , the skin of the affected limb can change colour and may be warmer or cooler than normal			1
hair and nail growth can dramatically increase or decrease ( possibly as the nervous system helps regulate this growth )			0
in time - generally months - the limbs can become weaker and frozen in position , not only because it hurts to move them , but because it becomes physically impossible to do so			0
although the condition was first identified during the @entity134 , @entity98 's cause is as yet not fully understood			1
however , it 's thought to stem from a problem with the nerves , as it can occur after a major injury to a nerve			2
this is referred to as @entity98 type 2			1
it can also occur after surgery or a mild knock			0
around 10 per cent of those who have a fractured limb will develop it , when it is known as @entity98 type 1			1
' just the trauma of a vaccination is enough to trigger it in some , ' says @entity153 , a consultant nurse at the @entity154 in @entity155 and professor of nursing and pain sciences at the @entity159 , @entity160			2
' however , in 9 per cent of cases the condition occurs without any obvious injury , ' she @entity161 may also be an autoimmune condition , suggests dr @entity166			1
' we are looking at the possibility that with @entity98 the immune system alters the way the nerves function - all the symptoms are nerve - related			1
' nerves can secrete neuropeptides , protein - like molecules that nerve cells use to communicate with each other , and in excess these can lead to swelling and discolouration of the skin - as happens with @entity98			1
' professor @entity153 adds there is no ' absolute evidence ' of this yet			0
the proportion of people with back pain who ca n't identify the cause ' what we do know is that even if it has an autoimmune component , things quite quickly get driven by the brain , ' she says			2
quite why limbs should become useless is not clear			0
' what we think happens is that people feel as if they ca n't use the affected limbs and this in time alters the way the brain talks to these areas , ' says professor @entity153			0
' this is most common among young females - their joints can become fixed in an unusual position			0
' the syndrome is three times more common in women and is most common among post-menopausal women , ' which suggests some hormonal element ' , says professor @entity153			2
physiotherapy can help keep the joint mobile , ' but it needs to be started as soon as possible to have best effects and that depends on an early diagnosis ' , she adds			0
yet although it is not an uncommon condition - affecting around 16,000 people in @entity222 - few doctors have heard of @entity98			1
' it 's not taught in medical schools , and many doctors will never even have heard it , ' says professor @entity153			0
' there is no definitive test - diagnosis depends on the patients explaining their symptoms and the doctor understanding what they mean			0
' patients commonly experience a delay in diagnosis and some may be told their symptoms are in the mind , says professor @entity153			0
' yet it is a very real condition that can be absolutely horrific			2
i have seen tough miners in tears with the pain of this condition			1
' in 80 per cent of cases , the condition resolves itself within a year , but for the rest , the condition can become progressively worse			1
patients commonly experience a delay in diagnosis and some may be told their symptoms are in the mind @entity249 and other strong painkillers have little effect , but nerve blocks - injections of local anaesthetic into the affected nerves - can help , as can spinal cord stimulation			0
this involves having a device fitted into your abdomen or buttocks that sends electrical pulses to your spinal cord , which alters how you sense pain			2
this helps in around half of all patients , says dr @entity166			2
he has recently completed a study using a drip of immunoglobulin ( a form of antibodies used by the immune system )			2
in his study , published in the journal @entity275 last year , a weekly infusion stopped the pain symptoms for two sufferers within months - even though they had been suffering from the condition for five years			1
' we expect it to be effective in a quarter of those with @entity98 and if it is going to be effective it will start working straight away , ' he says			1
for dr @entity0 , the road to recovery after his symptoms began in 2002 was agonisingly slow			1
' i eventually saw an osteopath who was also a doctor			0
he thought the problem originated in my upper ribs , ' he says			0
' after the first treatment manipulating my upper ribs , the nature of the pain changed totally			2
' he believes that for many people with @entity98 the upper ribs may be the problem			1
' many @entity98 sufferers report an initial shoulder impact , ' he says			1
' this can send a force from the shoulder through to the ribs so that they are a bit like bent sticks			0
' when they 're compressed they can rotate slightly			0
very small displacements at the spinal end of the rib can cause small but important distortion of the sympathetic trunk			0
' the sympathetic trunk is a bundle of nerve fibres carrying signals which control , for example , muscle reflexes , blood flow and pain transmission			2
if the ribs are disturbed enough , they can put pressure on these nerves and create havoc , adds dr @entity0			1
' as my ribs were freed with osteopathy my pain reduced and my hand returned to colour pretty rapidly , ' says dr @entity0 , who is now living a full and active life			1
he believes his experiences made him a better doctor			0
' what happened to me gave me so much insight into how people with long - term pain suffer , ' he says			2
' they go to their gp and shuffle out with a prescription for painkillers or an appointment to see the physiotherapist , but these people keep coming back because no one finds out why they have this pain			2
' our system deals with the consequences , but has stopped looking for the causes			0

@entity340 dr @entity0 from @entity67 had form of complex regional pain syndrome
@entity98 first identified in @entity134 , but cause not fully understood
in 9 per cent of cases the condition occurs without any obvious injury
