most people work out if they are overweight by stepping on to the bathroom scales or seeing if they can still fit into their favourite clothes			2
but doctors rely on a more scientific formula , called the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , which involves dividing a patient ’s weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared			1
for nearly 200 years this has been the gold standard by which the nation ’s weight patterns have been monitored			1
but now many scientists are asking just how useful it really is , because it fails to accurately assess your body fat			1
for example , a supremely fit and muscly athlete might be classed as obese despite carrying little or no body fat , simply because muscle is more dense — i.e. heavier — than fat			1
at the other end of the scale , a slim man with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy , despite the fact that he may be carrying a relatively large amount of fat around the waistline			1
this is important because visceral fat , which lies in and around the abdomen , is thought to be a key risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease			2
@entity41 fat secretes molecules that , among other things , lead to damaging inflammation in blood vessels			2
this flaw in @entity6 is why even super-fit people can be told to go on extreme diets because they register as overweight or obese on the @entity6 chart			1
scientists are questioning the reliability of measuring fat by @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
as a result of the flaws in this system , scientists are now turning their attention to new ways of measuring body fat			1
one is the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , which was developed two years ago by researchers at the @entity60 of @entity61 last month , @entity62 , a professional bodybuilder and personal trainer from @entity64 , was told she needed to lose weight after a nurse diagnosed her as overweight , based on her @entity6 score , during a routine visit to an @entity70 clinic			1
miss @entity62 , who finished sixth in the 2012 miss @entity72 bodybuilding competition , was told she needed to go on a 1,000 - calorie - a - day diet — half the recommended intake for a woman			0
at 4ft 11in and weighing 10st 3lb , she was found to have a @entity6 of 29 , officially ‘ overweight ’ and borderline obese			1
even in his prime , rugby star @entity78 was reportedly classed as overweight according to his @entity6			1
‘ where @entity6 is really useful is for measuring trends in large populations , ’ says dr @entity80 , chairman of the @entity81			2
‘ that ’s because when you look at large numbers , the big , muscly types and the thin unhealthy types tend to cancel each other out , so you can get an average over thousands of people			0
the big problem is with individual patients			0
’ as a result of the flaws in this system , scientists are now turning their attention to new ways of measuring body fat			1
one is the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , which was developed two years ago by researchers at the @entity60			1
a man measuring his @entity6			2
scientists think it could be inaccurate because a slim man with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy , despite the fact that he may be carrying a relatively large amount of fat around the waistline it uses a similar formula to the one used for @entity6 , but adds in waist circumference , so takes visceral fat into account			1
computer software then predicts the chances of dying from weight - related problems			0
for example , a score below one means there is less chance of dying prematurely from obesity - related conditions			0
but a score of two predicts the patient is twice as likely to die from obesity as the average person of their age and sex			2
a recent study , published in the online medical journal @entity133 , found this way of measuring the body was highly accurate at predicting deaths from obesity - related illnesses			0
the problem is while @entity6 can be worked out on a calculator , the @entity58 is more complicated and relies on computer software to convert the measurements into your risk of dying prematurely			1
another new approach is the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) , developed at the @entity146 in 2011			0
this uses a formula based on dividing your height by hip circumference to roughly calculate the body fat percentage			2
if the score is less than 23 , this suggests you have healthy levels of body fat			2
anything between 23 and 29 is overweight and 29 or over obese			0
so a man who is 5ft 9in but weighs in at 15st , with 44in hips , would have a @entity6 of 31 — making him only just inside the obese range			1
but his @entity145 score would be 31.2 — indicating dangerously high levels of fat around the waistline			0
in other words , it ’s a better insight as to how his fat levels are likely to affect his health			0
professor @entity171 , who developed the @entity145 , says it gives a good indication of fat levels whatever the patient ’s weight			0
but research has suggested it does tend to overestimate the amount of body fat in men and underestimate it in women due to statistical flaws			0
@entity183 experts stress that neither of the new scoring systems is used in the @entity70 and , for most doctors examining patients on a day - to - day basis , the most important factor is their tummy size			0
‘ put simply , if they have a big belly , then they have a weight problem and they need management , ’ says dr @entity80			0
‘ i use waist circumference as a measure because it ’s manageable			0
’ diabetes @entity183 says a woman should consider herself at risk if her waist reaches 31.5in ( 80cm ) , a white or black man 37in ( 94cm ) and @entity206 men 35in ( 90cm )			0
the threshold for the @entity206 population is lower because they tend to deposit visceral fat more easily .			0

@entity6 ( @entity6 ) has been base for monitoring fat for nearly 200 years
but scientists say a fit person could still be classed as ' obese ' this way
they are turning to new measurements such as a @entity58 ( @entity58 )
