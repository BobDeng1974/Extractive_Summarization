a fault to the public address system left @entity2 in silence on tuesday night - but @entity5 ’s promotion message was loud and clear			1
they close 2014 just a point behind leaders @entity13 at the top of the @entity15 after goals from @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 saw off @entity16			1
this result extended @entity5 ’s unbeaten sequence to 11 matches - of which eight have been victories - and made for a very happy new year for @entity22			1
@entity11 ( centre ) headed home @entity5 's second in their 3 - 0 home win against @entity16 on tuesday night @entity11 ( front ) wheels away in celebration after scoring @entity5 's second goal of the night @entity5 : @entity30 7 ; @entity31 ( c ) 7 , @entity10 7 , @entity32 7 , @entity33 7 ; skuse 6.5 , @entity34 6.5 ( @entity35 70 ) , @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 6 ( @entity38 83 ) ; @entity12 8 ( @entity39 90 +4 ) , @entity11 7 substitutes not used : @entity40 ( gk ) ; @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 goals : @entity10 31 ; @entity11 59 ; @entity12 90 booked : @entity12 , @entity10 @entity16 : @entity46 6 ; @entity47 6 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6 ; @entity50 6.5 , @entity51 7 , buyens 6.5 , @entity52 ( c ) 6 ( @entity53 70 ) , cousins 6.5 ; @entity54 6 , @entity55 6 substitutes not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 booked : @entity55 referee : @entity63 ( @entity64 ) attendance : 26,157 ( 1,023 away ) though a glitch in the electrics meant no music could be played or announcements made , leading to a slightly surreal atmosphere inside the ground			1
when the players emerged from the tunnel for the second - half , for instance , they were greeted by a ripple of polite applause more accustomed to a county cricket ground in the absence of any club compere , thumping club anthems or guitar licks			2
but despite the relative silence , @entity5 once again showed their @entity85 credentials , grafting and grinding their way past @entity16 ’s firm resistance			1
fitness was not an issue despite the punishing @entity91 schedule			0
@entity22 ’s men were tenacious , the first to every ball and predatory when their chances arose			0
@entity22 saw no reason to alter the team that had handsomely beaten fellow promotion challengers @entity99 and @entity101 in their last two meetings			0
even @entity41 , linked with a january move to the @entity85 , could n’t force his way back in after recovering from his infected toe			0
@entity16 were forced into a change after @entity107 went down in the warm - ups and @entity47 replaced him in defence			2
the visitors started the brighter and inside the first minute , @entity51 crossed deep from the right and @entity112 , straining to get a clean connection , placed the ball into the side - netting			0
highly - rated youngster @entity41 started the match on the bench for the tractor boys defender @entity33 ( left ) and @entity52 battle for the ball during their championship match on nine minutes , @entity5 came within a fraction of taking the lead			1
@entity12 curled an immaculate 25 - yard free - kick around the @entity16 wall , only to see the ball cannon back off the inside of the post			1
the frontman then showed textbook control to bring the ball down after @entity47 ’s clearance landed on his chest but the shot was dragged wide of the near post			0
the hosts were marginally the better side and their reward came just after the half - hour			2
a corner from @entity36 was headed into the mixer by captain @entity142 and , after @entity11 miscued his shot , it fell kindly for @entity10 to hook the ball in			1
it was the defender ’s fifth goal of the campaign and his second in two games after he rounded off that 4 - 2 win at @entity101 on @entity151			2
@entity10 slides on his knee in celebration after giving @entity5 a first half lead against @entity16 @entity16 , who started the night nine points off the play - offs in mid-table , responded well and a pass by @entity112 sent @entity55 into the clear			1
sensing the advancing @entity30 , @entity55 slid to get a shot away and the sprawling goalkeeper blocked			0
the ball fell out to @entity162 but his lob was n’t powerful enough and @entity32 cleared in front of his goal			0
@entity5 came within millimetres of doubling their lead in first - half stoppage time when @entity12 curled another free - kick onto the post , the ball bouncing out off the back of goalkeeper @entity46			1
the first chance of the second - half fell to @entity16 after the influential @entity174 pirouetted 25 yards from goal and fired a low shot that @entity30 gathered			1
it triggered the @entity180 side ’s best spell of the game and @entity52 headed over from @entity55 ’s right - side cross as the home crowd aired their frustrations			0
@entity12 completed the 3 - 0 scoreline late on for the hosts at @entity2 they need n’t have worried as @entity5 doubled their lead just shy of the hour mark			1
@entity36 ’s cross found @entity34 at the back post and his drilled ball was flicked on by @entity31 and @entity12 ’s diving header struck the crossbar			2
with no @entity16 defenders in sight , the ball bounced back for @entity11 to nod home his 17th of the season			1
the visitors did n’t surrender and @entity5 spent much of the closing stages pinned back			2
@entity32 had to be composed to clear off the line from @entity54 ’s sub-strength header			0
in the final minute , @entity12 scored the goal his stellar efforts deserved , running onto a through ball and finishing with aplomb			2
and towards the end there was plenty of noise			0
‘ the @entity5 are going up , ’ came the refrain from behind the goal			0
you ’d better believe them			0
victory for @entity22 's ( front ) side sees them close the gap to one point on league leaders @entity13			0

@entity10 put @entity5 ahead on 31 minutes with a right - *footed* shot
@entity11 doubled the hosts lead with a second half header
@entity12 completed the scoreline in the closing moments
win moves second - place @entity5 onto 47 points and *24* points
@entity16 drop to 13th in the table with 31 points
