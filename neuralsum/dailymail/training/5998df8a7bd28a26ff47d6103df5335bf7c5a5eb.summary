a diet consultant who stopped taking her own advice was so shocked by pictures of her 18st 7lb frame that she shed a third of her weight			1
@entity6 diet coach @entity5 from @entity7 , @entity8 , was so mortified by the snaps taken at a weight loss awards ceremony she embarked on a two - year health and fitness plan			1
now the 44 - year - old has lost 6st 7lb and inspired her father @entity16 , 68 , to lose 5st in the process			1
' i was n't following my own advice			1
but then i woke up one day and thought " this is my life , it 's not a game "			2
' i used to always wonder what people were thinking about me , i never felt comfortable and i had no energy			0
' describing her fluctuating weight as a ' constant yo - yo ' @entity5 - who is the slimmest she has been since she was 18 - used to gorge on toast with lashings of butter for breakfast , a huge sandwich filled with meat , coleslaw and mayonnaise for lunch and pizza and garlic bread for her evening meal			1
in between , the trainer for the @entity51 used to snack on chocolate , crisps , sweets , cake and ice cream			0
but transforming her body relied on changing her diet			0
' it 's about cutting out all the junk food and cooking from fresh , ' @entity5 said			2
' i still eat plenty and do n't go hungry			2
' @entity5 , who is still aiming to lose up to two more stone , now eats a diet of healthy fresh food and exercises she also attends a high - intensity @entity69 class twice a week			1
' it is filled with twentysomethings but i can keep up , ' she said			0
the diet and exercise regime has seen her slim from a dress size 24 to a size 12 and a svelte 12st - making her eligible for the @entity77 prize at the upcoming national @entity6 awards - but she still wants to lost another two stone			1
fortunately , her biggest motivation is close to home			0
@entity5 's father @entity16 , 68 , finally addressed his weight after undergoing a heart bypass two years ago			1
@entity5 's father @entity16 has also shed 5st - meaning the father - and - daughter slimming team have lost a staggering 12st between them he went to his daughter for help and managed to shed 5st thanks to attending her diet group , giving the father - daughter duo a combined weight loss of 12st between them			1
' he 's always been in my @entity94 so we have inspired and motivated each other , ' she said			1
' we have got one of the biggest classes in @entity8 and people look at us for motivation			0
' people specifically come to my class and say to me and my dad , " we 're here because we 've seen your pictures and you 're both such an inspiration "			0
' since losing the weight , @entity16 has won the @entity110 's @entity109 and mr @entity113 awards			1
' he learned he needed to help himself , ' says @entity5			0
' i am so proud of him			0
' she added : ' with @entity6 it 's all about taking the guilt away from eating and the freedom to eat certain foods freely			1
and everything is allowed in moderation			0
' today @entity5 keeps her weight in check by eating fruit with yogurt for breakfast , dishes like homemade chicken fried rice for lunch and a wrap or stew for dinner			2
she also cut out wheat and gluten , a protein in wheat , barley and rye , which she says has made a big difference			0
now if @entity5 and her boyfriend @entity139 , 52 , go out to eat , she sticks to rice or salads			0
' we still like to go out a lot but it 's all about making wise choices , ' she said			2
' it 's all about choice			2
you ca n't make excuses			2
' there 's long - term pleasure and then there 's short - term pleasure and the most satisfying thing for me is the short - term pleasure of people saying " who 's that girl ? " and not the short - term pleasure of eating fatty foods			1
' people keep calling me petite but i just ca n't get my head around it			0
my head needs to catch up with what other people are seeing			0
