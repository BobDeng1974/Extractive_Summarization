by @entity0 published : 15:03 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 15:03 est , 8 october 2013 an apparent @entity2 sighting in @entity3 has been labelled a scam after the mythical creature turned out to a huge tree stump			1
hiker @entity7 claimed he spotted not one but two of the seven - foot - tall ape - like beasts three weeks ago through the trees , just yards from a main road in @entity13 near @entity14			1
but a tipster told @entity16 either @entity7 was lying or he did n't know he was actually staring at a chunk of a tree that had been uprooted by well drillers			1
is it @entity2 ? @entity7 's close up photo , pictured , apparently shows one of the ' beasts ' spotted just yards from a main road through trees in @entity13 stumped : a tipster sent this photo of the same apparent @entity2 to @entity16 on thursday the anonymous debunker sent the website a photograph of what appeared to be the same figure @entity7 saw , but from a different angle , to prove his theory			1
' it was a scam , ' the tipster said			0
@entity7 's pictures went viral after he posted them online			2
the 57 - year - old explained he had been returning from the @entity40 with his girlfriend when the pair saw the mysterious shape moving in the forest			0
he quickly grabbed his camera and snapped a few shots as they slowed the car down and edged along the road			0
traffic backing - up behind his vehicle forced @entity7 to move on but not before he got what he believes is some of the best evidence yet of the existence of the legendary @entity55 creature			1
@entity7 , from @entity14 , said at the time : ' i 'm a skeptic myself , i 'm not a believer , but this was not a bear and you can see fur on it			1
' it 's wider at the shoulders and tapers down whereas a bear is bigger in the middle and stands differently with its paws out , this was standing like a man , like a @entity2			1
two beasts : @entity7 claimed this image , taken just two weeks ago near @entity14 , @entity3 , showed two of the mysterious creatures known as @entity2 wandering through the woods lurking : the photographs were taken by keen hiker @entity7 who was on his way home with his girlfriend from a festival with his girlfriend when the pair spotted the mysterious shape moving in the forest debate : @entity7 's photographs fueled the debate on whether the legendary creature actually exists ' at first some people have discredited it and said it 's just a root ball at the bottom of a fallen tree , but i 've been back to the exact spot and there is no root ball there			1
' we do have black bears , but they are considerably smaller than this , it was standing about seven - foot tall			0
' the day before the sighting @entity7 said there had been a ' @entity2 calling contest ' organised as part of the bridge festival - an event held annually in the area to commemorate an old viaduct destroyed by a tornado			1
he said : ' this was 200 yards from the road , it was too narrow for me to be able to pull over without stopping traffic but i got as many pictures as i could			0
' i actually dropped the camera casing so i could n't see what i had got until i got home and put them on my computer , i was surprised at what i saw			0
' i looks more like a bigfoot than anything else , i 've already had organisations asking me to send them copies for verification			0
' @entity7 - who is a member of the local outdoor pursuits group @entity131 - said he had never seen anything like it in the woods before			1
he said : ' this area is known for @entity2 sightings but this is the first time i have seen anything like this , i am in the woods every week , i hunt and go hiking			2
' i went back to the exact spot where it had been and there was nothing there , just years and years of leaves on the floor			0
' it came as researchers told a new conference in @entity152 that they have proof @entity2 is real and have even collected dna samples			2
location : outdoorsman @entity7 , pictured , said he was previously a skeptic but the strange ' creature ' convinced him the @entity156 has spent $ 500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years			2
@entity2 , also known as sasquatch , is the name given to an ape - like creature that some people believe inhabits forests , mainly in the @entity164 of @entity55			2
@entity2 is usually described as a large , hairy , bipedal humanoid			0
in 1951 @entity55 @entity166 photographed what he described as a @entity169 footprint beginning a spate of ' sightings ' and print finds throughout the 20th and 21st century .			0
