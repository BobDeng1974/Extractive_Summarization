@entity0 has revealed that astronauts aboard the @entity2 use virtual reality to train for spacewalks			1
however , while @entity6 's @entity5 and @entity7 are developing small , hi - tech solutions , @entity0 has used the advantage of zero gravity to fashion a more low tech solution			1
instead of a dedicated headset , astronaut @entity12 posted a picture of the solution - a laptop strapped to his face			1
@entity0 's system uses a standard laptop strapped to an astronaut 's face			1
a prototype of @entity6 's @entity24 headset his tweet revealed the system is being used to train astronauts in using a jet pack they use to get back to the station in the event of an incident that left them stranded			1
essentially a ' life jacket ' for spacewalks , @entity34 is a self - contained maneuvering unit that is worn like a backpack			1
the system relies on small nitrogen - jet thrusters to let an astronaut move around in space			1
its relatively small size and weight allow for convenient storage			1
however , its size was achieved by limiting the amount of propellant @entity34 carries , so it can only be used for a limited time			1
that is why @entity34 is intended primarily for emergency rescue , and not as an alternative to tools such as tethers and safety grips as a means of getting around the station			1
@entity60 crewmembers are required to use @entity34 whenever the shuttle is docked to station and unable to fly over to recover a spacewalker who has become un-tethered and ca n't get back to the airlock			1
astronauts control the @entity34 device by using a hand controller attached to the front of their space suits			1
@entity34 's propulsion , which is provided by 24 fixed - position thrusters that expel nitrogen gas , was first tested in 1994 by astronaut @entity74 outside the @entity75			1
according to @entity77 of @entity0 's virtual reality lab , the system is also used to train for spacewalks			2
@entity60 crewmembers are required to use @entity34 whenever the shuttle is docked to station and unable to fly over to recover a spacewalker who has become un-tethered and ca n't get back to the airlock			2
if an astronaut would drift off , it provides free - flying mobility to return to the spaceship			1
it is worn on spacewalks outside the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) , and was worn on spacewalks outside the @entity75			2
so far , there has not been an emergency in which it was needed			2
astronauts control the @entity34 device by using a hand controller attached to the front of their space suits			2
@entity34 's propulsion , which is provided by 24 fixed - position thrusters that expel nitrogen gas , was first tested in 1994 by astronaut @entity74 outside the @entity75			1
all of the space station and orbiter structures are graphically presented in the virtual reality helmets worn by the spacewalking astronauts			2
the structures are also displayed on video screens that simulate the actual camera views that crew members inside the space station or space shuttle would have			2
these views allow crew members to monitor the spacewalk activities as they would in orbit			2
' the same software used in the training facilities on the ground is also used on the laptop computers on the station , ' he said			1
' the crews in space use the software to review upcoming spacewalks and robotic arm operations before actually performing the tasks			2
' the program is also used on board during robotic operations to provide the arm operator a situational awareness view of the arm while it is in motion			2
' the graphic arms in the program are driven by " real " data from the " real " arms during actual operations to provide the operator with a synthetic bird 's - eye view of what 's happening outside the station			2
essentially a ' life jacket ' for spacewalks , @entity34 is a self - contained maneuvering unit that is worn like a backpack			0
' new configuration data can be developed on the ground and uplinked to the computers on board the station at anytime to make sure the crews have the latest station configuration at all times			0
' a series of upcoming spacewalks at the @entity2 have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits			0
@entity0 is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear			0
the fault is linked to a 2013 emergency when water dangerously flooded a @entity164 astronaut 's helmet causing a near - drowning			1
a series of upcoming spacewalks at the @entity2 have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits			0
@entity0 is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear the first spacewalk by a pair of @entity171 astronauts was supposed to occur tomorrow , but @entity0 today bumped it to saturday to complete a spacesuit investigation			0
the second spacewalk is now wednesday ; the third is march 1			0
the extensive , outdoor cable - routing work will prepare for the arrival of new commercial crew capsules in 2017			0
two critical fan and pump units for the astronauts ' spacesuits failed recently during routine maintenance in orbit			0
the spacewalks will be performed by @entity0 astronauts @entity186 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) construction of the @entity2 began on 20 november 1998			1
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity201 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity201 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
engineers suspect water seeped into the bearings , causing them to corrode and seize up			0
both units were returned to @entity201 on the @entity209 last week			0
spare units were put in the spacesuits , and those have checked out			0
@entity0 says a pump failure would cut short a spacewalk , but not endanger anyone			0
an unrelated problem with the same component led to an astronaut 's near - drowning in 2013			1
@entity219 , a space station manager , said earlier this week that the corrosion is likely the result of frequent water sampling put in place after the 2013 episode			0
@entity0 astronauts @entity186 and @entity12 are the designated spacewalkers			1
the astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station			0
the ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from @entity234 , @entity235 once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017			1
the space agency would like to pull off all three spacewalks before @entity186 leaves the orbiting lab in mid-march			0
private companies @entity241 and @entity242 are working on crew capsules — under @entity0 contract — to ferry @entity171 astronauts to and from the space station			0
@entity0 lost the ability to launch its own crews when the space shuttles retired in 2011 , and is paying @entity250 for crew transportation			0
the issue is related to the water - in - helmet leak that nearly drowned @entity255 astronaut @entity254 during a spacewalk in july 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered ( shown here in this image from the @entity2 ) - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water			1
