it was today claimed that he has made millions of dollars through a tax loophole in the @entity3 it has also emerged that mr @entity1 and his wife @entity31 were allowed to continue investing in @entity8 until at least 2009 and were still receiving tax - free income in 2010 and 2011			1
the @entity3 connection is complicated but boils down to the country offering huge tax breaks to multi-national firms such as @entity8 , which is reported to have avoided $ 100million ( 80million euros ) in dividend taxes there			1
@entity8 managed this by , in 2004 , investing in the @entity42 pharmaceutical company @entity41			1
