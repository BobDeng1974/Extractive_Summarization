the report by the @entity14 in @entity15 says chicken nuggets , ham and sausage pose the lowest risk of foodborne illness			1
something fowl : a new analysis of more than 33,000 cases of foodborne illness in the @entity8 shows that ground beef and chicken have caused more hospital visits than other meats the group used government data on 1,700 outbreaks over 12 years to analyze salmonella , @entity29 , listeria and other pathogens that were definitively linked to a certain meat			1
to calculate which meats were riskiest , @entity33 ranked the foods in which contamination was most likely to cause hospitalizations			2
some meats may have had more illnesses but were less likely to cause severe illness			0
after ground beef and chicken , @entity33 categorized turkey and steak as ' high risk ' and deli meat , pork , roast beef and beef or pork barbeque as ' medium risk			1
' @entity56 and @entity29 , pathogens that contaminate meat and poultry during slaughter and processing , accounted for a third of the illnesses surveyed			2
clostridium perfringens , a lesser - known pathogen that usually grows after processing when foods are left at improper temperatures for too long by consumers or food establishments , accounted for another third			0
brisket business : ground beef and chicken pose the highest threat for food - borne illness , while sausage , ham , and chicken nuggets have the least while a large number of chicken illnesses were due to clostridium perfringens , chicken led to many hospitalizations partly because of the high incidence of salmonella in chicken that is n't properly cooked			1
most of the ground beef illnesses were from @entity29 , which is found in the intestinal tracts of cattle and can transfer to the carcass if the meat is n't handled properly during slaughter			2
ground beef can be riskier than steak and other beef products because pathogens are spread during the grinding process			2
according to the report , listeria , salmonella and @entity29 required the most hospitalizations			0
somebody bring me some ham : @entity100 , sausage , and chicken nuggets had the lowest instances of illness outbreaks the group noted that the data is incomplete because so many foodborne illnesses are not reported or tracked			1
the @entity107 estimates that as many as 48 million @entity8 get sick from food poisoning each year			0
to reduce foodborne illnesses from meat , @entity33 recommends what they call ' defensive eating ' - assuming that meat can be unsafe			0
safe handling includes not letting meat juices drip onto other food or counters , cleaning cutting boards and plates that have held raw meat , wearing gloves when preparing meat and washing hands often			0
cooks should also make sure meat is heated to the proper temperature before eating it .			0

ground beef and poultry found to be most common meats to transmit pathogens
@entity100 , chicken nuggets , and sausage pose lowest risk
processing for ground beef and chicken allow setting for *bacteria* and other pathogens to grow
