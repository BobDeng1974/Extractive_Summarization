miss @entity11 , 30 , took them from the boot of her friend ’s car following a dinner party at her home in @entity51 , @entity15			2
the inquest , held at @entity53 , heard that @entity26 had been using ketamine before her death			1
four months before she died she enrolled herself into a drug treatment programme led by a group called @entity56 but discharged herself shortly afterwards			1
the inquest heard that @entity26 , who was an accomplished horse rider and well - known on the county 's equestrian scene , was said to have often assisted vet @entity61 with visits			0
it was told that it would be part of her role as an equestrian nurse to stock up miss @entity29 ’s car dubbed a ' mobile hospital ' with the various drugs			1
the night before her death , miss @entity11 hosted a dinner party for @entity29 and two other friends , where one guest , @entity73 , described her as being in ' good spirits '			1
miss @entity76 said her friend ' was always very happy '			0
but mr @entity73 said that after the dinner and when everyone had gone to bed at around 11pm he noticed miss @entity11 acting ' suspicious ' , before she went out to miss @entity29 's car			1
he said he had initially thought she was stepping out of the house to drive somewhere and warned her against it			0
he added : ' she muttered something to me and went out into the yard to the back of @entity61 ’s jeep			0
' she was rummaging in the back of the jeep			0
i did n’t know what she was doing			0
i asked her if she was okay , i did n’t quite hear what she said , i left her to it			0
' mr @entity73 added that as he went to brush his teeth he noticed the downstairs light on and saw miss @entity11 lying on the floor in the hallway			0
he said she had blood on her hand but had thought she had fallen and had cut herself			0
miss @entity11 was found dead the following morning and was said to have multiple needle marks on her left forearm , hand , wrist and mid elbow as well as marks to her upper chest and under her breast , that had ' looked very fresh '			1
@entity106 said that her cause of death had been respiratory depression due to combined drug use			2
coroner @entity111 said that the drugs would produce a central nervous system depression that would reduce breathing			2
coroner @entity111 said that someone who works with horses and cows ' may be expected to be aware of the consequences ' of taking powerful drugs like ketamine toxicology tests revealed that ketamine was found in her blood as well as a heart blocker drug and the sedative anaesthetic , which is used to euthanise animals			1
miss @entity29 told the inquest that her car , a @entity128 was like a mobile ' hospital ' , adding that @entity26 would have known what medication was in the boot of her car			0
she added : ' she would help me , pass me the drugs			0
' police were called to the scene the morning of her death but ruled out any suspicious or third party involvement			2
coroner @entity111 returned a verdict of misadventure , adding that he believe she had taken an ' opportunity ' to take the drugs			2
he said : ' what she did on this occasion she did on her own , no one else was involved , there are no suspicious circumstances			1
he added that one of the drugs , ' is used to put down large animals , horses and cows and so on the face of it someone who works in that field may be expected to be aware of the consequences of taking a dose of that			2
' however i also have to bear in mind no note was left			0
i have the very clear evidence of her behaviour the night before from three friends describing her as being in good spirits			1
' i believe against a background of past ketamine use , she has seen an opportunity , her friend and colleague ’s parked car and the left substances in the boot			2
a likely explanation is she has taken the opportunity to appropriate drugs from the car			2
' following her death , a statement from international horse charity @entity188 said that they were ' saddened ' to learn of @entity5 's death and that they offered their ' sincerest condolences to her family and friends '			1
