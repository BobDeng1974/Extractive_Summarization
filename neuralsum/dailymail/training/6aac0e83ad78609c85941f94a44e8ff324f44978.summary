by @entity0 @entity1 has just made a batch of chocolate chip cookies			1
they are luxurious yet light , as big as hockey pucks , completely scrumptious and oh yes , i 'd love another , thank you			1
however , according to @entity10 , they 're not perfect			1
@entity1 takes inspiration from other celebrity chefs then makes the recipe her own ' i chopped the chocolate far too much , ' she says			1
she pours a cup of excellent coffee and pushes it across her kitchen table			1
the coffee is not perfect , either			1
' it 's not @entity22 , ' she sighs			1
' i feel slightly guilty about that			1
i fight a battle every time i go to the supermarket			1
' such standards ! yet perhaps we should expect nothing less from the woman known as the @entity31			1
in her three cookbooks and her newspaper and magazine columns , @entity33 's mission is to rigorously test established recipes to find the best elements			1
she then uses these to produce the perfect dish , using the expertise from established cookery authors			1
she does this with a quiet authority one can only admire			1
' people get touchy about others offering advice on how to cook			1
you set yourself up with a high bar when you call something perfect			1
it makes you anxious about everything			1
' she is 31 , with a scrubbed face and uncomplicated hair			1
she oozes trustworthiness the way a figgy pudding oozes spicy fumes			1
when she read @entity58 at @entity59 , @entity60 , she had no idea she 'd end up winning awards as a food writer and become the go - to cook for the best way to make coffee and walnut cake or beef stew			1
' i 'm not a trained cook , ' she says			2
' i certainly could n't say i was an expert chef			2
but i would say that i 'm a moderately good cook for the amount of practice i 've had			2
and i 've had an awful lot of practice			2
five years of cooking relentlessly			2
' it is her meticulous approach that sets @entity33 apart			2
each week she selects a dish , then sources five or six recipes for it from her collection of over 200 cookbooks			1
her library includes titles from @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			2
@entity10 does n't make much of @entity91 's tiramisu then , in her ordinary kitchen with her four - burner hob and ' bog - standard ' domestic fan oven , she rigorously tests these recipes			1
finally , taking the best elements from each , she will create a master recipe			1
recent triumphs include clam chowder ( thicken with flour , not crackers ) , coffee and walnut cake ( @entity88 's is better than @entity91 's ) and tiramisu ( @entity90 adds orange , @entity10 does not approve )			2
to this end , her life is spent cooking and shopping , then doing more shopping before cooking			2
from the three - storey townhouse in @entity114 , north @entity115 , which she shares with barrister boyfriend @entity116 and her dog , a cairn terrier called @entity119 , she sallies forth with empty bags and returns laden			2
when i visit , she 's made six batches of goulash , concluding that shin of beef is the best cut to use , as recommended by @entity127			1
the house pulsates with the rich aroma of paprika and lard , while the fridge is crammed with tubs of goulash			2
the thing that bothers her most is the wastage			2
what can you do with six goulashes ? ' last night , @entity116 almost rebelled			2
' he said to me , “ not goulash again ! ” i said , “ come on , man up ! we 've got to get through this			2
me and the dog ca n't eat it all			2
” i mean , look at @entity119			2
that 's why he 's a little bit fat			0
' @entity10 's new cookbook , @entity148 , has 92 recipes that have gone through her strict tests			1
it 's an entertaining read , even if you 've never picked up a saucepan in your life			0
however , she likes to choose recipes that ' most people who cook a bit will know something about '			1
over the next three weeks , some of them will be serialised in weekend , including tarte au citron and beef @entity165			0
the kind of straightforward grub that 's popular and delicious is @entity33 's speciality			0
everything is subjective , she feels , but there are a few recipes she thinks she finessed until they were spot on			1
' a ragu @entity175 , which i think is pretty perfect			1
a moussaka i thought i really cracked			0
' but she 's not dictatorial and says authenticity can be overrated			0
' if it works for you , go for it			0
' neither is she a slavish respecter of culinary reputations			0
for her , it 's all about what works			0
she 's not afraid to suggest @entity89 might have got it wrong , or @entity86 's recipes are too underpowered for the modern palate			1
she also dismisses the efforts of @entity193			0
' i have n't used her recipes , although i 'm sure they 're wonderful			1
i did see her book in the @entity199 shop window and i contemplated going in and buying it but i had the dog with me so i did n't			0
oh , that sounds catty ! i just think @entity193 and i are doing different things			0
' how did we get here ? @entity10 grew up in @entity205 where her father was a @entity207 executive and her mother was a @entity209 teacher			0
' i dislike lemon curd , tinned tuna makes me heave , i hate parsnips and i 'm not keen on parsley			0
i do n't like truffles either			0
they 're sort of armpitty			0
' her first food memory is gnawing a plastic - wrapped @entity220 , nicked off a supermarket shelf when she was in her buggy			0
she went to board at @entity224 at 13 , and remembers making fudge on rainy sundays			0
after university , she went into publishing			0
' i had a dream of discovering the next @entity229			0
' instead , she discovered herself , and her super-charged taste buds – which are surprisingly fussy			0
' i dislike lemon curd , tinned tuna makes me heave , i hate parsnips and i 'm not keen on parsley			0
i do n't like truffles either			0
they 're sort of armpitty			0
' @entity10 's books promote nourishing food			0
she was appalled by a recent survey that claimed the most popular evening meal in the @entity243 is sandwiches			0
' people say they do n't have time to cook , yet the average person spends four hours a day watching tv			0
it 's a life skill			0
people should know how to do it			0
' she cites @entity91 's spaghetti and @entity253 as an easy home - made supper			1
' chefs on tv make it too complicated , but it does n't have to be like that			0
' so what did everyone have to eat today at @entity262 ? the menu went like this			0
@entity10 had avocado on toast and a biscuit , @entity119 had squid , @entity116 made himself a plate of tuna with @entity33 's roasted garlic salsa and leftover lamb - rice			1
' he mixed it all together into a sludge , put @entity276 mayonnaise on top and ate it			0
@entity279 , ' she says			0
but at least it was home - made .			1

@entity1 has made her fame by *reinventing* recipes
she is a complete perfectionist and rarely finds a recipe ' perfect '
she has launched a new cookbook @entity292
