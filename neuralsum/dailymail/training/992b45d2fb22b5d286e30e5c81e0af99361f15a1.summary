a month before the plan was announced in 2010 without the consultation of his party colleagues , the prime minister sought out the advice of mr @entity0 on the controversial policy			1
the consultation took place at a dinner while mr @entity0 was in @entity16 and allowed the magnate to drum up support among his @entity16 - based editors			1
the book claims mr @entity0 considered paid parental leave to be a ' visionary ' plan which would even help his own employees at his @entity16 - based operations , reported the @entity26			1
the meeting happened over dinner while the @entity37 based mogul was in @entity16 , according to treasurer @entity38 ( right ) in the biography , ' hockey : not @entity41 ' details of the private meeting are revealed in a biography of treasurer @entity45 : not @entity41 '			0
mr @entity38 claims in the book that mr @entity3 only mentioned the scheme to him as ' a brief add - on in a telephone conversation , with no specific date or details attached ' , before it was announced			1
' they were encouraged to support it ( @entity0 's editors ) , notwithstanding that it represented a tax impost and was skewed to be of most benefit to parents outside their middle - @entity16 readership , ' he says in the book			2
' this fact was unknown to members in the party room , who condemned @entity3 ’s solo policymaking on such a fundamental issue			0
' despite mr @entity38 's claims he was not given specific details of the scheme , the book 's author @entity68 writes that the prime minister recalled a far more thorough conversation between himself and mr @entity38 ' @entity75 was one of the very few colleagues whom i discussed the paid parental leave proposal with ... i do n’t want to verbal @entity75 but he certainly saw the merit in it – that 's not quite the same as saying he enthusiastically supported it , ' mr @entity3 is quoted in the book as saying			1
@entity3 is believed to have proposed his $ 5.5 billion paid maternity leave scheme in a bid to improve his image among female voters			0
the plan has proved controversial with his party because of a proposed tax on big business to pay for it however , mr @entity3 's decision to announce the plan resulted in a showdown with mr @entity38 saw the prime minister after the announcement on @entity97 on march 2010			1
mr @entity38 said he was left ' irked ' and ' offended ' that although mr @entity3 had given him the @entity99 portfolio , he had not been consulted on the massive $ 5.5 billion spending commitment to introduce the policy			2
yet resolving the issue and talking it out like ' two old mates ' , mr @entity38 says in the book that the pair ' sort of had a heart - to - heart ' , where he told the then @entity109 leader : ' we ca n't do this			2
it 's not the way '			0
the conversation ensured a commitment between the two to support each other publicly , yet just one - year later , the @entity117 was not supported by the prime minister when he suggested family trusts should be taxed the same way as companies			0
the paid parental leave scheme was considered by many to be a ploy to attract female voters , with mr @entity38 not initially sold on and threats at the time that @entity128 and senators could cross the floor to vote against it			1
previously the scheme was to see six months paid leave at full salary up to $ 150,000 a year funded by a 1.7 per cent levy on company tax above $ 5 million to controversially cover the costs			0

but he said prime minister @entity3 was an ' outstanding individual ' who he got on well with			0
