by @entity0 published : 09:32 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 10:53 est , 27 january 2014 being suddenly plunged into darkness during power cuts can be a frightening and inconvenient experience			1
but one inventor has created what he claims is the world ’s first light bulb that wo n’t turn off in a power outage			1
@entity11 ’s device looks similar to a normal light bulb and can be screwed into every day light sockets , but it is far handier in a crisis			1
but when the power supply fails , it switches to an using a rechargeable battery so that power outages are not as disruptive			1
the device was invented by mr @entity11 , 52 , from @entity18 after he became frustrated that he could n't find a torch during a power cut at his home			1
the bulb works like a normal bulb and uses an everyday light switch but when the power goes out , it continues to light up			2
it is filled with technology ( pictured ) so that it can continue to work without mains power when the power supply fails , @entity11 's @entity61 bulb switches to an led bulb with a rechargeable battery so that power outages are not as obvious			1
he is pictured here with his battery - operated bulb to solve the problem , he researched and designed his @entity61 bulb , which can be pre-ordered for $ 35 each ( £ 21 ) or $ 40 , ( £ 24 ) with international shipping and are estimated to be delivered in april			1
‘ about three years ago , we could not find the torch during a power cut			0
i then thought that having a light bulb which works during a power cut would be convenient and cool , ’ mr @entity11 said			1
‘ i researched the net and there was nothing available in market except some standalone emergency lights or backup generators for commercial applications			0
‘ this is the first of its kind			0
this bulb works like a normal bulb and uses the normal light switch but when the power goes out , it continues to light up			2
’ he explained that the bulb can be turned on and off from the same wall switch during a power failure			0
the bulb has an intelligent control circuit with grid and switch sensor technology , a rechargeable battery with charging circuit and an inverter , he said			2
the bulb has a battery , control technology , intelligence , cpu , memory , inverter , and a printed circuit board inside ( pictured ) to make it smart and efficient , @entity100 said ‘ the bulb also houses a cpu , memory and a printed circuit board to make it smart and efficient , ’ he added			0
‘ after a power failure , bulb will stay on for four hours continuous use and it can be used almost anywhere			0
‘ on top of that there is no change in wiring required or any extra hardware needed - all people need to do is simply change their existing bulb			0
’ mr @entity11 is currently raising funds to manufacture his @entity61 bulb on crowd funding website @entity127 and has pulled in $ 91,804 – more than the $ 50,000 he set out to raise			2
after a power failure , the bulb will stay on for four hours and it can be used almost anywhere			0
here , its inventor demonstrates how it can be carried like a torch as well as operated via a normal lighting socket			0

@entity11 ’s device looks similar to a normal light bulb and can be screwed into every day light sockets
during power cuts , the @entity61 device switches to an led bulb with a rechargeable battery to make power outages less disruptive
the @entity18 - based inventor is *selling* his bulbs for $ 35 each ( £ 21 )
