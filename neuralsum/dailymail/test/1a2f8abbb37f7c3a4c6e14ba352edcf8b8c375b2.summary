two goals within ninety seconds of each other was enough to spark an outbreak of fear and loathing rarely seen on this side of the @entity6			2
after more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of @entity9 's faithful finally snapped when @entity11 moved decisively ahead , in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous saturday 's @entity13			1
the loathing was directed mainly at manager @entity15 , who was announced on sunday morning to have left the club by ' mutual consent '			1
the @entity9 players look down after the final whistle , as the prospect of relegation looms large this is how it ends in football sometimes : standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter , who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out			1
the fear involves dropping out of the @entity34 a week on saturday after 94 years of membership , something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards			1
@entity15 departs with two games to go and after a 3 - 0 defeat against a thoroughly professional @entity11 side the @entity44 's only professional sports outfit are one point behind @entity46 and two behind @entity48			1
relegation to the @entity51 – the grand - sounding new title for the conference but do n't be fooled – may partly be down to @entity55 legend and ex-manager @entity54 , sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence , and now masterminding @entity48 's unlikely survival			1
and it could all happen under the ownership of former @entity64 chief executive @entity63 , knowledgeable football man and esteemed former @entity9 player who took over the club late last summer			1
@entity67 celebrates scoring , as a professional @entity11 side eased past sorry @entity9 the battle between @entity70 and @entity71 to win automatic promotion to the @entity34 will go down to the last game			1
@entity70 , who lead the @entity53 by one point , have a home game against mid-table @entity76 on saturday while @entity71 face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom @entity79 , who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated			1
rovers looked as if they would head the table after the weekend ’s games but conceded a goal with two minutes left to draw 1 - 1 at @entity85			1
that put @entity70 , who dropped out of the @entity34 two seasons ago , in the driving seat after a 1 - 1 draw away to @entity90			1
@entity93 are guaranteed a play - off spot , but one of @entity95 , @entity91 and @entity92 will miss out			2
it all seemed such a good idea at the time			0
nobody questioned his judgement in october when , with the team bottom of the table , he replaced the inexperienced @entity102 with a seasoned operator like @entity15			1
there was the odd dead cat bounce , but six months on they are still bottom after failing to keep a clean sheet for nineteen consecutive matches			0
the mersey ferry displays a quicker turning circle than that shown by the home defence for the two killer goals that came just after half - time , but then a cause of that may be a lack of familiarity among players			0
a staggering 52 have been called up to first team duty this season			0
@entity15 played the selection and recruitment game like a man on the fruit machine , continually pulling the handle in the hope that the right combination would come up in alignment			1
the latest loan signing has been young @entity132 winger @entity131 who , when pulled off on saturday after 60 minutes , could be seen haranguing some of his team - mates on the bench			0
it was not long after full - time that you could catch assistant manager @entity139 , part of a distinguished list of former @entity9 players who graduated to a higher level , stripping the paint from the dressing room walls			1
@entity15 has left the club by mutual consent , with @entity9 bottom of the league with two games to go @entity139 – now in charge for the next fortnight – then had to deny that @entity15 's decision to dodge the media was of any significance			1
he then professed himself ' dumbfounded ' by the team 's performance			0
and so it unravels in desperate times			0
they had actually competed gamely in the first half , but were overwhelmed by anxiety when getting anywhere near the goal			0
' it 's not acceptable , ' he said			0
' we just do n't look like scoring a goal			0
the players have got to start taking some responsibility			0
it 's an easy option pointing fingers at the manager but the players have got to look at themselves , have they done enough ? the answer is no. i was a player			2
you 've got to stand up and be counted			0
' @entity178 , well - travelled journeyman and among those fighting for his career , did not try to shift the blame onto the management			0
he just about summed up the sense of disbelief saying : ' it 's a big club , when i joined in the summer i never imagined that we would be where we are			2
' the prospect of dropping out of the 92 is something uniquely grim in @entity193 football , especially for a club of this heritage , who shortly after joining the league gave a debut to 16 year - old local lad @entity199			2
it was only in january 2013 that they stood on top of @entity204 and early in the last decade reached the @entity206 final plus three @entity208 sixth rounds			0
but they do not have to look far for examples of how there is no easy road back in the event of relegation			2
aside from @entity216 and @entity217 there is @entity218 , not far across the @entity220 border and a decent sized club , who fell out of the league in 2008 and have yet to return			2
there is a long trip to @entity226 next saturday and then a last home game against @entity228			0
the unpalatable odds are that the next stop after that could be somewhere like @entity232 or @entity85 .			0

@entity9 on brink of relegation from @entity236 with two games to play
@entity71 manager @entity15 left club by mutual consent on sunday
@entity9 could drop out of @entity34 after 94 years
