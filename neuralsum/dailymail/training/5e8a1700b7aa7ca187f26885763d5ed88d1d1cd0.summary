the bill for translators brought in to assist non-english speakers appearing at magistrates or crown courts for criminal cases soared from £ 7.9million in 2012			1
the figures , uncovered in @entity14 responses from the @entity15 , appear to show the rise occurred since services were outsourced to under - fire firm @entity18 and @entity19			1
they were revealed after the handling of court foreign language services to just one company was branded ‘ shambolic ’ by mps amid concerns the change had caused trials to collapse or be delayed			2
farcical episodes that have emerged since privatisation include the case of a man who was charged with perverting the course of justice was instead accused of being a ‘ pervert ’			0
in a burglary case at @entity36 in east @entity37 , a retrial was ordered when it emerged that the @entity40 interpreter had muddled the words ‘ beaten ’ and ‘ bitten ’			0
and in @entity43 , a murder trial was brought to a halt when the court interpreter confessed he was an unqualified stand - in for his wife , who was busy			2
@entity48 were allegedly so lax that a director of another translation company was able to sign up his cat @entity51 as a translator – who was then offered jobs			0
mps on the @entity57 ’ @entity55 were told that a ‘ catastrophic ’ shortage of interpreters had forced courts to rely on @entity61 , a comparatively crude and time - consuming online translation service			2
there are around 11,000 foreign nationals in @entity65 prisons , around 13 per cent of the total prison population , with many needing interpreters at numerous court hearings and appeals			1
lax standards : the rise apparently occurred since services were outsourced to @entity73			1
following the move , a ' catastrophic ' shortage of interpreters forced courts to rely on @entity61 ( pictured ) , mps were told courts across @entity80 used to rely on local interpreters but in january 2012 the former @entity15 controversially handed a monopoly on translating to a private firm , @entity83 , in an attempt to cut costs			1
the company was then bought by @entity73 amid a wave of criticism from the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , which previously provided courts with language experts			1

five months earlier , the @entity55 said the privatisation had been ‘ shambolic ’ and led to cases collapsing and people unnecessarily being remanded in custody			0
a spokesman for the @entity15 confirmed it paid out £ 15.5million for ‘ interpreting and translation services ’ to the courts last year compared to £ 7.9million in 2012			1
