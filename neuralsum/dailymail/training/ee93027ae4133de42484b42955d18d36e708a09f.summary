by @entity0 high street fashion stores have cancelled orders for angora wool products after appalling footage emerged of the barbaric treatment of rabbits in @entity8 farms			1
the horrific scenes , some of which were published in the @entity12 last month , show angora rabbits screaming as their fur is torn from their bodies while still alive			2
in other parts of the footage , obtained by animal rights group @entity19 , the rabbits are seen tied up by the front and back legs , as their bodies are cut and bloodied as their fur is roughly sheared			1
in response to the footage and widespread customer outcry , more than 35 companies – including @entity31 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 – have said they will no longer stock angora products			1
@entity50 has also said it will halt all future angora orders until it has ‘ concluded our visits to farms ’			2
@entity55 ’s fashion company said it will no longer use angora in any of its products			1
a spokesman told the @entity59 : ‘ in light of information released about the widespread despicable treatment of angora rabbits , we have decided to stop all future use of angora in @entity55 products			1
the images , taken at an undisclosed location in @entity8 , shows angora rabbits in cages the rabbit is bent across the woman 's knee before being trimmed of its fur using scissors ‘ although we have always guaranteed that our angora wool mix fibres come from a cruelty - free source in @entity79 , we are no longer willing to encourage the use of angora in luxury fashion			1
’ the angora rabbit is bred for its long , soft wool that is made up of fine , hollow fibres , making it softer than cashmere and a popular material for jumpers and scarves			0
@entity8 is responsible for 90 per cent of the world ’s supply of angora			1
investigators went to ten angora farms and witnessed the widespread abuse of animals at each one			0
at half of the farms visited , a particularly barbaric form of live plucking is used to remove the fur			0
they also found that the sensitive pads on the rabbits ’ feet were being sliced open by the wire base of their filthy cages – leading to illness and infection – and they are never given the chance to dig , jump or run			0
and after their fur has been removed , they are thrown back into their cage to re-grow their coat in complete solitude			0
cruel : the dead rabbits are processed for meat after their fur is taken for wool the woman holds the rabbit by the ears while trimming its fur at the @entity8 angora farm shocking truth : the animals are constantly injured from throughout the plucking as they struggle to break free torture : the @entity8 fur traders use the plucking technique as it results in better quality fur and more money @entity19 , which is campaigning for shoppers to boycott angora wool completely , did not name the farms to protect its sources			1
@entity19 ’s campaigns manager , @entity141 , said : ‘ many retailers have taken on board customer complaints , but , while we welcome their decision to stop sourcing angora products , we would urge them to also pull existing angora stock			1
’ @entity29 has a trade value of £ 22 to £ 28 per kilogram , but the longer hair which comes from plucking , as opposed to shearing , sells for more than double that			2
the rabbits can live for as long as ten years if treated properly			0
professor @entity152 , of the @entity153 , said : ‘ for a rabbit to vocalise as it does in the video indicates it is in severe distress			0
’ animal cruelty : the angora rabbits are alive throughout the plucking and are kept for several years , plucked every few months , before their throats are slit locked up : the cages injure the rabbit 's feet and the insanitary conditions see many of them , such as this one , suffer infections and illness pain and suffering : the terror in the animal 's eyes is unmistakeable as a worker with a @entity8 angora trader stretches it out and yanks out its fur there are thought to be more than 50 million rabbits on angora farms in @entity8 , producing more than 4,000 tonnes of fur a year			1
in @entity8 , there are no penalties for the abuse of animals on farms and minimal , if any , standards to regulate their treatment			2
it is by far the world ’s biggest producer , followed by @entity192 , @entity193 , the @entity194 and @entity195 , which produce the bulk of the remaining 10 per cent of the supply chain			0
left to recover : after the rabbit had had all its fur yanked out it is thrown into a cage to regrow its fur in complete solitude no hope : this young bunny is in the process of regrowing its fur while recovering from an eye infection in a naked steel cage a new law was drafted in 2009 , but has not been implemented			0
in 2009 , campaigners exposed how down used in jackets and other items was being ripped from the bodies of live geese by @entity8 suppliers			2
two years later it emerged that raccoon dogs were being skinned while still alive to produce imitation sheepskin boots .			0
