@entity9 , 21 , spent most of her teenage years in boots and overalls helping muck out on her parents ' farm in @entity15			1
the shy teenager only had two friends at school , where she was shunned for her unkempt appearance , and spent most of her time with her horses			1
beauty : farmer @entity9 has made an astonishing transformation from ugly duckling to top model shunned : @entity9 was rejected by classmates for being unkempt and preferring to spend time with her pony but after discovering make - up on her 18th birthday , @entity9 started to turn heads in her local pub and with her confidence boosted , decided to take up modelling because she ' needed another hobby '			1
and her hobby has paid off			2
just three years into her modelling career , she stunned friends and family by winning the prestigious @entity8 's @entity41 2013 award last month and will now represent @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , in the world finals in august council administrator @entity9 said : ' it 's all been a bit overwhelming because up until a few years ago i had no confidence in myself whatsoever			1
' i was called an ugly duckling at school			1
i was always on the farm in my overalls and slacks			2
i did n't really discover make - up until i was about 18 when i got some on my birthday - i did n't even know how to put it on			1
' when i went out i suddenly got people noticing me and telling me i looked nice			0
i realised i liked looking good and it just went from there			0
' my friends suggested i had some professional pictures done and the photographer said i was a natural			0
he made some calls to modelling agencies and it went from there			0
who 's laughing now ? pretty @entity9 will now represent the @entity42 in the @entity71 2013 final in @entity44 model : @entity9 originally took up modelling as a hobby but it 's now turning into a lucrative career ' then i had to learn how to walk in high heels because i was only use to wellies from mucking out the horses			1
' i never had any self confidence , i was shy and i only really had two friends at school			2
i got to 18 and i thought i need a new hobby			0
so i thought sod it , let 's try modelling			0
' along with the @entity8 's @entity71 2013 award , @entity9 has triumphed in other modelling competitions , including miss @entity15 in 2011 and @entity42 's @entity90 the following year			1
the former farmer also models for swimwear designer @entity93			0
she added : ' i felt like the outcast at the first competition			0
most of the girls are a little bit different from me			0
' but the second time i was much more confident and now i 've really come out of my shell - i never dreamed i would be modelling swimwear			2
' it 's safe to say i 'm not as shy and reserved as i used to be			0
boys never used to notice me before - but they sure do now			2
' low maintenance : @entity9 did n't get to grips with make - up until she received some for her 18th birthday admiration : it was n't until she started turning heads in the local pub that @entity9 realised she was a beauty			1

@entity9 was ostracised at school for her unkempt appearance
she did n't wear make - up until she received some for her 18th birthday
