hackers could have gained access to celebrity @entity4 accounts using just an email address and a search engine , it has been claimed			1
@entity8 's password reset system for accounts has become the latest target in the hunt to find out how nude photos of @entity13 and ' 100 other celebrities ' were leaked			1
it allows people to reset a password by answering two security questions - the answers to which can often be found online for celebrity users			1
experts say worried consumers should turn on two - step verification for their @entity4 account			1
the tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password			1
to set up two - step verification , go to my @entity8 @entity37 manage your @entity8 id and sign in , then select @entity41			2
under two - step verification , select get started and follow the onscreen instructions			2
when a user sets up two - step verification , they register one or more trusted devices			0
a trusted device is one that can receive 4 - digit verification codes using either @entity50 or @entity51			0
@entity8 has admitted it is ' actively investigating ' claims a flaw in the ' @entity51 ' function of its @entity4 service may have helped a hacker to steal the photos			0
today it emerged hackers may also have used the service 's password reset function to gain access to accounts			1
this allows users to reset their password by entering their username , date of birth and correctly answering two security questions			1
experts say this information should be relatively easy to find for celebrities			1
@entity8 does email users to tell them their password has been changed			1
however , on the @entity75 hacking messageboard , those who say they have used the method claim that it 's often best to reset the password at night so that the password reset email can be read and deleted before the target is awake			1
@entity79 , a security expert with @entity80 , warned celebrities not to use the real answers to these questions as hackers would be able to find many of the answers online			1
' the key is not to put the real answers to these questions , ' he told @entity87			1
the reset system allows those who have forgotten their password to reset it by answering a series of questions			1
users are asked to first confirm their date of birth - which is straightforward to find online they are then offered two options - to change their password using email authentication or by answering security questions users are then asked to answer two security questions , which range from their first car to their favourite job , which were set up when they signed up for the account			1
code on software development site @entity105 called @entity106 , would have allowed malicious users to use ‘ brute force ’ to gain an account ’s password on @entity4 , and in particular its find my @entity51 service			1
@entity8 has since issued a fix for the bug			0
' the end of the fun , @entity8 has just patched , ' read an update on the post			0
brute force , also known as ' brute force cracking ' , is a trial - and - error method used to get plain - text passwords from encrypted data			0
just as a criminal might break into , or ' crack ' a safe by trying many possible combinations , a brute - force cracking attempt goes through all possible combinations of characters in @entity131 a six - letter attack			0
' many users use simple passwords that are the same across services so it 's entirely possible to guess passwords using a tool like this , ' said @entity140 form @entity141			1
@entity79 , who admitted hackers had tried to access his account , warned that it was still unclear exactly what happened			1
' we do n't know what happened yet , and in the security world , you need all the facts			1
' he also believed consumers were likely to stay with the firm despite the breaches			0
' historically we do n't see a mass exodus from breaches , consumers do n't seem to change their behaviour			0
' there 's a lot of historical precedent here - and this is just a first strike for @entity8			0
' it does appear that there was a flaw in @entity4 - and we need to hear from @entity8 what the problem was , and what they are going to do to make it better , ’ experts believe the breadth of the celebrities affected could be down to a ‘ chain effect ’ - once one celebrities phonebook was accessed , it could lead to dozens more			2
security consultant @entity176 told @entity87 : ' for these attacks to work , you also need email addresses of target			2
' but what we have seen is that hackers can access address books - and this would have helped the hackers			2
' @entity186 also believes the ' reset password ' system may have been used			1
' it certainly possible that people would have used this , ' he said			0
' in the case of celebrities , these secret questions are very easy to find online - either in @entity195 or by searching through some interviews			1
' @entity197 requires users to respond to an email sent to their address to reset a password @entity8 has only issued one statement , last night , on the attacks			1
' we take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report , ' @entity8 spokeswoman @entity205 told @entity87			0
@entity176 said that anger was growing at @entity8 among @entity4 users			2
‘ even though we do n’t know exactly what happened , the feeling is growing that @entity8 was n't doing enough to stop this , ' he said			0
however , @entity176 believes customers will stick with @entity8			0
‘ i do n't think we 'll see a mass exodus - people 's memory are very short			0
@entity219 and model @entity220 are among those hit by the leaks so far ' @entity8 is about to announce a new @entity51 , and people will use @entity4 to move their data do it , because it ’s such a simple process			2
the hacker claims he or she broke into stars ' @entity4 accounts , including those of the @entity234 actress , @entity233 and @entity235 , before publishing them on 4chan , the image - sharing forum			0
a list of the alleged victims of the hack - a staggering 101 in total - has also been posted online ; most of whom have not seen any photographs leaked by the hacker			2
@entity176 said he thought ' more leaks are to come '			2
experts also think a flaw in @entity8 's find my phone was used for some of the hacks			2
however , despite not admitting the bug was caused by its system , the tech giant issued a ' patch ' , or fix , for the alleged ' @entity51 ' bug some claim is responsible			2
code on software development site @entity105 called @entity106 , would have allowed malicious users to use ‘ brute force ’ to gain an account ’s password on @entity4 , and in particular its find my @entity51 service			1
@entity8 has since issued a fix for the bug			0
' the end of the fun , @entity8 has just patched , ' read an update on the post			0
the hacker who posted the first batch of pictures said it was the result of ' several months of hard work by all those involved ' brute force , also known as ' brute force cracking ' , is a trial - and - error method used to get plain - text passwords from encrypted data			0
just as a criminal might break into , or ' crack ' a safe by trying many possible combinations , a brute - force cracking attempt goes through all possible combinations of characters in @entity131 a six - letter attack			0
' many users use simple passwords that are the same across services so it 's entirely possible to guess passwords using a tool like this , ' said @entity140 form @entity141			1
and in a statement issued on monday afternoon , the @entity295 confirmed that it had also begun an investigation			0
' the @entity295 is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals , and is addressing the matter			0
' any further comment would be inappropriate at this time			0
' @entity305 became the first celebrity to publicly criticise @entity8 on monday when she posted a sarcastic message on @entity308			0
the @entity310 star tweeted ' thank you @entity4 ' , the day after naked photos of her were published online .			2
