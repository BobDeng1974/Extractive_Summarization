a plane flying from @entity1 to @entity2 hit near supersonic speeds yesterday after getting caught up in a powerhouse jet stream			1
@entity5 , a @entity7 777 - 200 jet , took off from @entity8 at 10.50pm @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , and landed at 9.06am local time at @entity2			0
the total flight time was five hours and 16 minutes , well short of the estimated minimum six - hour journey			0
the speed of sound at sea level is 761mph			0
several flights are reported to have made the journey from @entity1 to @entity2 yesterday in around five hours 20 minutes due to the 200mph @entity43 jet stream			2
how the stats measure up for the supersonic flying @entity5 jet from @entity1 to @entity2 the conditions around the @entity43 have meant the @entity23 have been feeling the effects of a polar vortex passengers leaving @entity8 heading to @entity2 yesterday were treated to a reduction in flight duration it is not unexpected for the jet stream to intensify during the winter months , with flight times in january and february between the @entity23 and the @entity24 shortening in duration			1
the temperature contrast between the equator and the @entity19 is at its greatest during these months , and as well as leading to polar - vortex related climate experienced by the @entity23 currently , air pressure and wind increases			0
sadly , however , the strength of the jet stream is heavily weighted in one direction ; that is to say flights heading to the @entity23 from @entity66 will see an increase in duration			0
the heavier green points on the @entity70 signify the powerful jet stream across the @entity43 the @entity43 jet stream route was taken advantage of by the @entity74 , when in 1996 it hit a top speed of 1,350mph and took just two hours and 53 minutes from @entity1 to @entity2 often this is because pilots are forced to fly closer to @entity80 to escape powerful headwinds , as oppose to the direct route over the @entity43			1
despite the @entity7 777 - 200 jet reaching a top speed of 745mph , it does n't come close to matching the top speed of the @entity74 on the same flight path			1
back in 1996 , a @entity1 to @entity2 flight took just two hours , 53 minutes , and hit top speeds of 1,350mph .			2

@entity7 hit top speed of 745mph on @entity1 to @entity2 route
flight time cut as powerhouse jet stream sweeps over the @entity43
speed of sound at sea level is 761mph , @entity74 hit 1,350mph
