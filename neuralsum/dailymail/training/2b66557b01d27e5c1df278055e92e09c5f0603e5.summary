by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity2 's female swimmers made it another golden night in the pool with @entity4 winning her second gold and @entity6 topping the podium after winning three silvers and a bronze earlier in the week			1
@entity4 , 24 , has promised greatness for a long time now and is delivering in @entity11 in sensational style			1
it took her just 25.20sec to make history last night in a watery blur of brilliance			2
she led the race throughout , becoming the only woman to win @entity20 gold in both the 50 metres butterfly and 50m freestyle			1
‘ it feels just amazing , ’ she said			2
‘ i wanted to swim a bit faster but it ’s another personal best so i ca n’t complain			2
i was in control the whole race and could n’t feel anyone ’s presence too close			1
’ less than two hours before , she advanced to her fourth final of the week , this time for tonight ’s 100m freestyle , touching on 54.88 to qualify fifth fastest			1
golden girl : @entity4 poses with her medal during the ceremony winner , at last : @entity36 has a gold medal to add to her three silvers and one bronze finally : @entity36 was able to pose with the gold medal after her brilliant 200m medley final performance ahead of the pack : no other swimmers are even in sight as @entity36 heads for the finish seemingly everything @entity4 does is with maximum gusto			1
that extends to singing the national anthem , which she did at full volume as @entity52 reverberated round the @entity53 in her honour			2
@entity4 frolicked and flirted her way around the edge of the pool as she did a lap of honour with her gold medal			1
as well as being one of @entity2 ’s most talented swimmers she is a natural entertainer out of the pool			2
@entity4 has a breezy manner but things have not always gone her way			1
in @entity65 four years ago she had to settle for one gold and had to be fished out of the pool after being struck down by a stomach bug			1
in @entity68 in 2012 she came away empty handed from five medal races			1
‘ i ’ve had to grow up , ’ she said			2
‘ the knocks and blows have forced me to			2
when things are going well you do n’t have to			2
i know i have the capabilities			0
’ @entity4 claims much of her improved form is down to the rapport she has with coach and former olympian @entity78 , who she appointed after @entity68			1
‘ it ’s really good the fact that @entity82 , he understands me , ’ she said			0
‘ he ’s gone through it himself , went through the @entity85 that i went through and i have total faith in him and what he asks me to do			0
’ easy does it : @entity4 won her second gold in the 50m butterfly final on sunday at the @entity93 centre on top of the world : @entity4 is the first woman to do the sprint double in the pool after a brilliant showing @entity6 , 18 , is a more understated personality but similarly earmarked for greatness			1
she was only 12 when her idol @entity101 became a double @entity85 champion			0
six years on her hero was commentating on @entity104 as @entity6 won @entity20 gold in the 200m medley			1
‘ she is my role model			0
i ca n’t put into words how much her support means to me			0
it ’s incredible having someone there who has been through it all			0
for her to really believe in me means so much			0
’ @entity6 powered off the blocks and led throughout			0
she was half a body length clear after 50m but @entity116 @entity115 closed in on her and the two were almost level at halfway			1
unfazed by the @entity85 silver medallist on her shoulder , @entity6 motored away to take gold in 2 min 8.21sec , breaking the @entity20 record by more than 1.5sec			1
home favourite @entity122 clinched bronze behind @entity124 in 2:10.74			1
@entity6 said her victory made it a ‘ dream ’ games			0
‘ i was n’t sure i had it in me , ’ she said			0
‘ but i ’m over the moon so that was a dream			0
my coach said to me yesterday i was one race away from making it a better week than i could have imagined			2
’ well done : @entity115 in the yellow cap congratulates @entity36 after she finally claimed gold leader : @entity36 was at the front from the start but pulled even further ahead to finish two seconds clear based in her hometown of @entity140 at one of @entity143 ’s two elite performance centres , @entity6 has flourished under the guidance of her coach @entity145			1
‘ @entity146 ’s coached me since i was 14 , ’ she said			0
‘ he ’s perfect for me			0
we ’ve been through so much , ups and downs , he ’s not just a coach but a friend			0
this is an amazing moment and i ’ll get to go and celebrate with him			0
’ at 16 , @entity6 was the youngest member of the @entity143 team which failed to perform in @entity68			0
like @entity101 , who won two bronzes , she was excused from blame after finishing 21st in the 100m breaststroke			2
but she said the mood among the team in @entity11 is much different			0
‘ we are all chuffed to bits because collectively , not just as @entity2 but as @entity143 with the @entity163 and @entity165 results , we have been doing amazingly , ’ she said			0
‘ in the @entity2 team there is such a good vibe and i ’m proud to be part of it			0
’ as a reminder of her youth , @entity6 said she would celebrate with ‘ lots of sweeties , ’ but not yet — she has a chance to win a sixth medal in the 4x100m relay medley			1
there was more good news for @entity2 as @entity180 won bronze in the 50m backstroke in 24.98 .			1

@entity36 's winning time was also a @entity20 record
