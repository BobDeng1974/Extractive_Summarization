by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 19 march 2013 an antiques collector who sold a @entity3 bowl may have lost out on £ 150,000 after forgetting he had another that would have made a lucrative pair			1
@entity7 and his family were thrilled when his antique ' rice ' bowl from the 18th century fetched a staggering £ 235,000 at auction			1
but it was n't until after the sale that the family remembered a matching piece mr @entity7 had given to son @entity15 30 years ago			1
@entity7 sold an antique rice bowl for £ 235,000 but had it been offered as a pair with another bowl he owned ( pictured ) experts believe the value would have increased by a third to nearer £ 650,000 the second bowl is now set to command a similar price when it sells as a single lot , making a total of nearly £ 470,000 for the pair			1
but experts believe that had the items been offered together they could have fetched over £ 600,000			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity29 , had inherited the two @entity31 porcelain bowls from his father @entity32 who had brought them back from working in @entity3 in the 1920s			1
the extremely rare bowls are six inches in diameter , are decorated with pheasants and were made for the @entity38 in the 1720s			1
@entity40 , a 55 - year - old chartered surveyor , had no idea what his bowl was when given it and has stored it in a box in the back of a cupboard for three decades			2
mr @entity7 , from @entity47 , said : ‘ my jaw hit the floor when i found out my father 's bowl sold for a six - figure sum			1
‘ a few days after the sale he suddenly announced that he thought there might have been a pair of them			2
‘ he had completely forgotten about giving it to me and i had also forgotten about receiving it			0
the second bowl is set to fetch a similar price when it sells as a single lot , making a total of nearly £ 470,000 ‘ it was my wife , @entity64 , who said ' oh yes , we do have a @entity3 bowl in a box ' that prompted us to get it out and low and behold there was the twin of the first bowl			1
‘ i had just put it in a cupboard for safekeeping and simply forgot about it			0
‘ i 've decided to sell it not because i need the money but because i 'm anxious about having something so valuable in the house			0
‘ it is easy to wonder with the benefit of hindsight just how much a pair would have been worth had we sold them together			1
a pair being sold together must be extremely rare			2
‘ but it seems rather pointless to think like that now because it has been and gone			0
’ the first pheasant bowl was sold last year by the @entity88 in @entity29 that had put a pre-sale estimate of £ 8,000 to £ 12,000 on it			1
but because the market for @entity93 antiques is booming at the moment due to the newly - rich @entity3 buying back their heritage , bidding on it took off			0
it eventually went to an anonymous @entity3 buyer , who saw off 11 other rival bidders to net it for £ 195,000			2
with the fees added on he would have paid £ 235,000			1
@entity106 @entity105 with the second @entity38 bowl which is due to be sold later next month the same auction house is now selling the second bowl			1
although the estimate is £ 150,000 there is no reason why it will not sell for a similar price			2
@entity7 ' father started collecting @entity93 porcelain in 1925 during the time he worked for an @entity118 / @entity3 mining company in the port of @entity120 near @entity121			2
his son , now aged in his 80s , began his own collection in the 1960s and 1970s from top @entity127 dealers			0
@entity128 , an expert of @entity3 porcelain and consultant to the @entity88 , said : ‘ we obviously did n't know about the existence of the second bowl			0
‘ after the first sold for the significantly high price the vendor popped up and said he might have had a twin to that bowl			2
‘ had we known it would have been nice to have the two bowls together in a single sale			0
sadly , we did n't know			0
’ the auction for the second bowl takes place on april 16 - 17			0
a traditional chinese ' @entity143 ' marriage bowl has sold for a whopping £ 260,000 at auction			1
the @entity3 masterpiece would have been brought by the bride as part of her dowry to marriage			0
it fetched £ 10,000 above the estimated price at auction at @entity153 's in @entity154 , @entity155 , and sold to a mystery @entity3 collector			1
the rare jade marriage bowl , which dates back to the 19th century , is from a collection of the late commander @entity160 of @entity161 , near @entity154 , @entity162			2
a rare jade marriage bowl is to be sold at auction and is estimated to fetch an incredible £ 250,000 the bowl 's ring handles , suspended from auspicious phoenix masks are typical of the form and the jade is of a pale celadon colour prized by the carvers of that era family members have passed it down over the years and the item was eventually handed to @entity176 's auctioneers			1
the jade bowl , thought to be around 270 years old , is a type which was popular at the @entity180 court , the last imperial dynasty of @entity3			0
it would have been brought with a quantity of gifts including gold and porcelain , with jade being one of the most important of these gifts			0
its ring handles , suspended from auspicious phoenix masks are typical of the form and the jade is of a pale celadon colour prized by the carvers of that era			0
the phoenix birds on the handles of this bowl are emblematic of new beginnings or rebirth which is why it would have been given as a gift from the bride 's family to her new husband			0
@entity205 , director of @entity153 's , said : ‘ we were delighted to be able to offer this magnificent bowl for sale today and were very pleased with the huge amount of international interest the bowl generated			0
