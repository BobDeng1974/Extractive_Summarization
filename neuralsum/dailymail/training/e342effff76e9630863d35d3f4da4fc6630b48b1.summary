the @entity0 have hit their toughest obstacle yet - a big burning ball of gas			1
@entity5 weather in the @entity7 resort of @entity8 has melted ski and snowboard runs , leaving huge patches of grass exposed and making the athletes ' intricately - prepared runs treacherous			1
for those with time on their hands , however , the heat is good news - with @entity21 's first ever medallist on the snow @entity22 catching some well - deserved rays			1
pictured is the sun setting over the @entity36 cauldron that 's better ! fresh from winning bronze , @entity21 's first ever on the snow , athlete @entity22 tweeted a photo of herself with snowboarder @entity42 , saying : ' enjoying a wee " bronzing " moment in the sun ' what @entity0 ? spectators took a break in @entity8 to enjoy bright blue skies on the beach and sit under palm trees - while ski runs melt and athletes complain that conditions could soon become dangerous a new @entity36 sport : men wade tentatively into the sea with the main @entity58 stadium visible behind them lovely day for some skiing : two @entity0 volunteers disrobed during a break to take a dip the @entity21 athlete relaxed on a deck chair with shirtless fellow @entity21 athlete , snowboarder @entity42 , and tweeted : enjoying a wee ' bronzing ' moment in the sun with team mate @ benkilner # sochi # mountainvillage			1
' residents and visitors at the @entity0 resorts have been stripping off on the beach and frolicking in the @entity78			1
the summer olympics ... @entity80 ( 2012 ) - 10 degrees @entity81 ( 2008 ) - 5 degrees @entity82 ( 2004 ) - 18 degrees @entity83 ( 2000 ) - 23 degrees @entity84 ( 1996 ) - 1 degree @entity86 ( 1992 ) - 17 degrees @entity87 ( 1988 ) - 6 degrees @entity88 ( 1984 ) - 26 degrees @entity89 ( 1980 ) - 3 degrees @entity90 ( 1976 ) - minus 10 degrees ... and the winter olympics @entity92 ( 2010 ) - 8 degrees @entity93 ( 2006 ) - 15 degrees @entity94 ( 2002 ) - 9 degrees @entity95 ( 1998 ) - 2 degrees @entity96 ( 1994 ) - 0 degrees @entity97 ( 1992 ) - 7 degrees @entity98 ( 1988 ) - 4 degrees @entity99 ( 1984 ) - 14 degrees @entity100 ( 1980 ) - minus 5 degrees @entity101 ( 1976 ) - 7 degrees others have worn sunglasses and shorts while they lay sunbathing under palm trees - with the mercury set to rise even higher , to 17 degrees , over the next two days			1
meanwhile the athletes , who are used to training in below - freezing temperatures , had to shield themselves from the sun and make sometimes severe changes to their technique			1
ski jumpers face injury in softened landing areas while many of the sliding events like curling have been held at night to stop the ice being melted as fast			0
meanwhile those who rely on extravagant tricks for their sport , like snowboarders , are floundering as they struggle on their courses			0
one @entity126 race track had training suspended in a bid to preserve as much snow as possible for today 's event			2
@entity0 authorities in @entity7 have reservoirs of snow packed away near the mountain venues yet dismissed calls for it to be used , claiming it was not needed			1
@entity136 , head of the local organising committee , told journalists : ' it 's not a big surprise for us			0
we 're a subtropical city '			1
the top temperature in @entity8 today was 15 degrees celsius , warmer than all 10 of the last @entity0 host cities and six of the last 10 @entity148 cities			1
it has led the @entity58 at the @entity7 resort - famously warmer and more humid than most of the country - to be nicknamed the warmer or subtropical @entity0 , with some people questioning why the @entity58 were held there in the first place			1
the hastag # @entity156 has begun trending on @entity157 as armchair athletes from around the world compare conditions on their tv sets to what they can see out the window			2
the coldest of the last 20 host cities today was @entity90 at a top temperature of minus 10 - with only @entity86 , @entity88 , @entity82 and @entity83 warmer than @entity8			1
kicking back : women relax on deck chairs as warm weather gives a milder feel to the @entity171 palm trees : visitor @entity173 lies on the grass with friends in an unusual scene for a @entity0 get the shades on : spectators carried their coats as they walked into the olympic park			2
an official dismissed calls to pipe in stockpiled snow for the mountain venues , saying : ' it 's no surprise ... we 're a subtropical city ' whew ! @entity189 , from @entity190 , @entity191 , takes a drink of water while walking through the @entity171 wearing a sun dress today			1
the heat is set to increase over the next few days to 17 degrees celsius disgruntled : a man in a full @entity7 athlete 's kit shields himself from the sun with the @entity7 flag exhausted ? two women sun themselves on a small bench in the @entity171 on a crystal - clear day lazing about : the hot weather has not been the best news for winter sportsmen as it ruins months of training @entity80 , which enjoyed a heat wave as it hosted the @entity148 in 2012 , was five degrees colder than @entity8 today while 1980 @entity148 city @entity89 was a full 12 degrees colder			1
@entity212 ski jumper @entity210 said : ' holes and ruts form if the snow on the landing zone is not hard enough ... the snow becomes unstable , and if we are landing consistently in the same area , and at a high speed , the pressure associated with landing can make it unstable			2
' @entity225 @entity126 ski racer @entity224 went from being a pre-race favourite during training runs down an icy hill to an eighth - place finisher when the downhill course got slushier on sunday			2
he said : ' it would be a tough call to be like , " the weather is changing , we 're just going to go completely throw a dart in the dark and hope it hits			0
" we had to stick with what we knew			0
' in hindsight , it was a mistake , because on training day , it was boilerplate ice and you needed a lot of edge			0
and on race day , you needed to be more subtle , more smooth ' cooling off : construction workers took a dip on a break from work as temperatures hit 15 degrees celsius splashing around : the @entity78 resort is known for being warmer than most of the rest of @entity7 thirsty work : two swimmers get out of the water , with the @entity257 visible in the far background @entity148 sport : several men went fishing on the beach at @entity8 , just a few yards from the @entity171 poor timing : @entity80 , which enjoyed a heat wave as it hosted the @entity148 in 2012 , was five degrees colder than @entity8 today while @entity266 city @entity89 was a full 12 degrees colder @entity267 : perhaps @entity7 are more accustomed to cold weather , but athletes have also complained outdoor sports have always been at the mercy of the weather			1
training for a pre-olympic @entity273 weekend in @entity274 , @entity275 , had to be cancelled while fog forced the cancellation of the last men 's downhill race before @entity8			0
that race had already moved from @entity281 because of a lack of snow			0
women 's races , meanwhile , shifted from one resort in @entity287 to another because there was n't enough snow - only to have rain and fog wipe out a giant slalom at the new spot			1
and it may have been warmer than every other @entity0 host city today in @entity8 , but they have not been without there problems either			1
four years ago races were delayed by warm weather in @entity302 , @entity303 , while at @entity93 , @entity304 , in 2006 the women 's @entity305 was postponed 24 hours			0
skiing in @entity95 , @entity308 , had to wait for two days in 1998 and at @entity99 in 1984 , both downhill races were postponed			0
heat : the sun 's appearance has made conditions treacherous in events like the snowboard halfpipe , pictured the show must go on : athletes are in the last throes of training for their winter events despite the weather idyll : the beach next to @entity8 's @entity324 today			1
the @entity0 in @entity302 , @entity93 , @entity95 and @entity99 were all affected by warmer - than - expected weather			1
the february average for @entity8 is 10 degrees @entity126 : @entity327 keeps the snow along the course icier and therefore more compact and slick			2
softer snow means it 's easier to make turns , but also slows down the skiers , tempting them to take more risks and be more aggressive otherwise they ca n't build up enough speed			0
@entity336 : riders call the slush ' mashed potatoes ' and it slows them down , making it harder to get enough air to pull off flips and twists			0
conditions must be as perfect as possible and start slipping when the temperature gets anywhere above freezing			0
@entity349 : the firmer the snow surface , the better it is for slopestyle skiers and snowboarders , because it gives the athletes a firmer takeoff and more time in the air			2
@entity358 : soft snow can slow down the cars and turn races into more strategy as speed , which could make things more interesting for the viewers if not the athletes			2
ski jumping : athletes risk injury when the artificial snow in the landing area is heated by the sun. their landings become bumpy , which can throw competitors off - balance and make them fall			2
also , their skis could dig too far into the snow			0
the ramp itself is kept cool by a refrigeration unit			0
cross country and biathlon : courses become treacherous in the downhill curves , where it 's easy to lose one 's balance at high speed on thin skis			0
skiers adjust the amount of wax on their skis and can change the setup several times a day			0
sliding sports : many of the sliding competitions are being held at night for lower temperatures			0
@entity396 of pipe installed in tracks pump temperature - controlled ammonia through the concrete , keeping the surface cold enough during the day			0
shades installed on the track 's roof also shield the ice from the sun , and workers spray dry ice and @entity409 : @entity410			0

resort is hotter today than last 10 @entity0 cities - and 6 summer ones
visitors and @entity21 medal - winner @entity22 have stripped off in the sun
snow sports have been *disrupted* as athletes complain runs are dangerous
@entity36 official dismissed concerns , saying : ' we 're a subtropical city '
