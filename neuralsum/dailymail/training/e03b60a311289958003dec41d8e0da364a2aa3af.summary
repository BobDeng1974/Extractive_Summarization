by @entity1 reporter published : 07:05 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 09:11 est , 10 july 2013 @entity2 is one woman who never needs a man to help her open a jar or carry her bags - because she is stronger than most men			1
in fact @entity2 , 33 , is so strong she can tear a telephone book with her bare hands , bend a frying pan in half and crush apples with her biceps			1
despite her butter - would n't - melt look , the pretty brunette bends metal bars into hearts , uses her fist to hammer nails into wood and can even blow a hot water bottle up like a balloon - until it bursts			2
the former religious studies graduate , from @entity37 , @entity35 was working at a prestigious accounting firm in @entity39 before she quit to follow her dream to join the circus			1
she spent time performing as an aerialist at a circus in @entity44 before deciding to use her strength to create a unique act of her own			1
@entity2 spent months attempting to rip telephone directories in half and bending bars in a bid to carve out her niche in the industry			1
number 's up : @entity2 makes light work of destroying a telephone directory shredded : @entity2 , who is known by her stage name @entity29 , triumphantly throws up the pieces of paper into the air impressive : @entity2 shows off her most difficult trick - blowing up a hot water bottle until it explodes she said : ' i was working at @entity64 with grand offices in the @entity66 making more money than both my parents and i decided to quit my job and run away with the circus			1
' everyone thought i was crazy , i had this great job and yet i was quitting to work as a circus performer			1
but i just thought if i do n't do it now , i never will			2
' after a while i fell out of love with the circus and wanted to become a street performer but i knew i needed an act , something brand new			1
' i 'd always been quite strong and so decided to base my act on my strength			2
one day i looked at a telephone book and thought ' i wonder if i can rip it in half ? ' the idea for my act came from there			1
' it was n't easy , there was a lot of trial and error			2
i would get my room mate in @entity44 to help me out with my acts			0
tough nut : the strongwoman hammers a nail into a piece of wood with her bare hands ' i 'd beg him to help me with these really weird stunts			0
i 'd built this bed of nails at home and i 'd be like ' please come stand on me '			0
her most jaw - dropping feat of strength is the ability to blow a hot water bottle up with her mouth until it bursts - a stunt so dangerous it could cause her lungs to explode			0
@entity2 then showcased her self - taught feats of strength to the public as a street performer in @entity44			1
the public loved her act and word of her strength quickly spread			2
her unique talent has now earnt her hoards of fans across the world , as she travels the globe performing at events across the @entity130 , @entity131 and as far a field as @entity133 and @entity134			1
she said : ' when i finally managed to rip the phone book in half i screamed , ran around my living room picked up some duck tape and stuck the book to my wall , i was so proud of myself			2
for my next trick : @entity2 prepares to bend a metal bar			1
she gave up a well - paid job with an investment and insurance company to become a circus strongwoman @entity147 : @entity2 goes to work on a metal bar which she swiftly bends into a heart shape ' the next thing i learnt was bending metal bars and i moved onto crushing apples with my biceps pretty quickly after that			1
it was really funny looking back but that first year i was terrible , i 'd fail miserably nearly everyday but i refused to give up			0
' ' no - one is magically brilliant at anything straight away , i believed it was worthwhile enough to go ahead with that i stuck with it			0
' there were times in the beginning when i thought about giving up but i would n't let myself			0
' i think it comes down to the fact i did n't want to go home with my tail between my legs , failure was n't an option			0
' @entity172 handler : with @entity2 around , no household object is safe crush on you : @entity2 , 33 , is so strong she can bend a frying pan in half as if it were made of cardboard it took six months of practicing before @entity2 finally managed to tear the telephone directory in two , it was this achievement which spurred her on to continue			1
the 5 ' 2 performer quickly taught herself to bend bars , punch nails into flaming blocks of wood and crush apples with her biceps			1
' blowing up and popping a hot water bottle is definitely the hardest and most dangerous part of my act			2
' it took about a year to perfect , i can now do it under a minute			0
' there 's so much air pressure that when it explodes the bits of rubber often hits me in the face , which hurts			0
' the real danger is the air pressure , if a little bit of air comes out of the water bottle and back into your lungs it can cause your lungs to explode			0
' down time : the religious studies graduate , from @entity37 , @entity35 was working at a prestigious accounting firm in @entity39 before she quit to follow her dream to join the circus stitch up : @entity2 relaxes with a spot of knitting			1
she spent months attempting to rip telephone directories in half and bending bars in a bid to carve out her niche ' i tested my act with the public as a street performer in @entity44			1
the reaction from the audience was so strong it spurred me onto continue			0
' now i 've created this truly unique show and i have fans all over the world			0
little girls come to my show in outfits like mine			0
one little girl told me she has a poster of me next to @entity232 in her bedroom , which is really cool			0
' so much of being a strong woman is about inspiring people to try it for themselves			0
people do n't fully appreciate my show until they go home and try to rip a telephone book in half and realise they ca n't			1
' i 've had ex military and special forces men offer to pay me $ 100 to teach them how to rip the telephone book but i ca n't , you can be strong and i can teach people the technique but its as much practice as it is skill			2
big hitter : @entity2 playing baseball when she was youngster			2
she has always been strong and decided to base her circus act on her tremendous physical strength @entity2 on a night - out ( left ) before giving up her job to join the circus and ( right ) after graduating from @entity254 , @entity39 ' i 'm always looking for new ideas for my act and at the moment i 'm combining my aerialism with my strength so i 'll hang from a bar by my feet and tear the telephone book			1
' when she 's not showcasing her strength , @entity2 said she is very girly at heart and loves to knit and bake cookies in her spare time			2
she said being a strong woman does have a downside as men are often intimidated by her strength and rarely offer to carry her bags			0
she added : ' i am a strong woman but at home i 'm like most other women , i 'm very girly i love to cook , knit , do crochet and sew			0
' i enjoy sitting by the pool and sunbathing , i 'm very girly at heart			0
' being strong means i get asked to open a lot of jars and very rarely does a guy carry my bags , they offer and then they look at me and say " you 're stong enough , do it yourself			0
