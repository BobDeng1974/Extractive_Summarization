@entity0 has urged @entity2 's teams to start making sacrifices in a bid to save the sport from completely imploding			1
@entity0 's words of warning come at the end of a miserable period for @entity2 , notably with @entity10 and @entity11 entering administration			1
with costs spiralling out of control , and with the @entity19 powerless to act , three other cash - strapped teams in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have threatened to boycott the @entity21 @entity20 as a protest at what they perceive as a lack of action to stop the folly			1
@entity2 boss @entity0 says he is to blame for problems afflicting some of the smaller teams @entity0 , however , has dismissed that prospect out of hand			2
' forget all that c * * p , ' the @entity2 chief said			2
' i promise they will be racing			2
' they will be racing , i give you a guarantee - but i worry if they will be racing next year			1
' therein lies @entity0 's major problem - one which has surprisingly led him to concede that ' i know what 's wrong , but do n't know how to fix it '			1
@entity0 added : ' no - one is prepared to do anything about it because they ca n't			1
the regulations have tied us up			2
' if we were in a position where we could help these teams in trouble , we would do it			2
but we are not allowed to			2
@entity14 are one of three teams who have threatened to boycott the @entity21 @entity20 ' if one team is given 10,000 ( @entity21 dollars ) , everyone has to have 10,000			1
the trouble with lots of regulations and lots of contracts is we do n't think long term			0
' part of the problem is the contracts @entity0 has negotiated over the years with the teams , which includes the distribution of revenues			0
the smaller marques are dismayed at how the likes of @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 overwhelmingly receive the lion 's share of the £ 900 million handed out			1
@entity0 added : ' it makes no difference to me how the money is shared out			0
' if they sat down here with me now and said they want to share out all of the money they get in a different way , i would say , ' good , give me the bit of paper '			1
' the problem is there is too much money being distributed badly - probably my fault - but , like lots of agreements people make , they seemed a good idea at the time			1
' another issue @entity0 faces is the teams now have too much say in the regulations , and , given so many vested interests , there is a lack of agreement			0
@entity105 - based @entity16 are fuming at not having a say in the running of the sport @entity0 has a solution , but knows what the outcome would be			1
' i would say to people getting a chunk of money that i would like to take a percentage of their performance - related payment , ' @entity0 said			1
' i would put that money together to divide among the three or four we know are in trouble , and then i would put in the same amount of money			0
' but there would not be one team that would think it was a bloody good idea			0
' in the old days , the people sitting around a table would be the guys who could say yes or no. they would ask me to sort it out and it would be sorted			0
' but none of the modern guys can agree anything , even if they wanted to			0
they all have to report back to somebody			0
' although @entity0 is effectively known as the commercial rights holder , it is private equity firm @entity138 which runs the sport - much to the apparent dismay of the teams			1
with @entity0 no longer the man in overall charge , he said : ' if the company belonged to me , i would have done things in a different way			0
smaller teams like @entity15 are struggling to make ends meet ' that 's because it would have been my money i was dealing with , but i work for people who are in the business to make money			1
' another option for @entity0 is to ' tear up all the contracts '			0
he added : ' i 'd take all the money , pay all the teams ' debts that should be paid so people have n't suffered because of @entity2 , and people have n't got credit for @entity2			0
' i 'd then say this is what you are going to get next year , this is the amount of money we 've got , and this is what is going to happen from now on in			0
' the bottom line for @entity0 is the big teams have to yield			0
' it 's not the biggest crisis i 've dealt with , but i 'm not happy , ' he said			1
' it 's just you are talking about larger amounts of money , so therefore it is more difficult to solve			1
' we 'll have to do something about it because we ca n't all sit back nicely , relaxed and think the problem will go away			0
' it 's not like having the flu and taking a few tablets and it will disappear			2
' the situation is such that if enough people want it resolved , we can resolve it			0
' it 's a case that the people involved in the sport will have to want to look after the sport and be prepared to make some sacrifices			2
