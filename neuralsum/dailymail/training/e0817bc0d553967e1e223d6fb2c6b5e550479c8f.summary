more than half of @entity3 families will have just one child by 2022 , experts predict			1
the number of single - child families has grown by almost 12 per cent in the last decade , according to official figures			1
this means the proportion of parents stopping at one child is already at 47 per cent			1
by 2021 , 50 per cent of number of @entity3 families with have one child			1
the number rose from 42 per cent in 2003 , to 47 percent in 2013			1
having one child continues the bloodline but means less commitment and sociologists warn it is inevitable that the figure will soon pass the 50 per cent mark			1
professor @entity20 , a sociologist at @entity21 and author of @entity23 , said : ‘ the number of families with one child in @entity3 will be more than half within seven years			1
‘ for many people , having one child is like an insurance policy			1
‘ it fulfils their need to carry on the bloodline without having to make as much commitment			1
’ the figures , from the @entity34 ’ study on families and households , show the trend is affecting all types of families			1
the proportion of married couples with one child grew from 37 per cent to 40 per cent from 2003 to 2013			1
first - borns have long been thought to be the most successful child in a family			2
but new research suggests their younger siblings actually do better – because they are spurred on to top their achievements			0
researchers from the @entity51 examined primary school test results and gcse scores to see how the success of first - born children in school affected their younger brothers and sisters			0
they found having an older sibling boosted a child ’s learning by as much as spending an extra £ 670 on schooling could achieve			2
the effect is even more pronounced in less well - off families			2
study authors @entity65 and @entity67 said older children can pass on their knowledge , help with homework , or give tips about school and teachers , for which parents might have less experience			0
some youngsters succeed by imitating a high - achieving older sibling , for example by copying their work style , while others do better by trying to be different			0
the ‘ sibling spillover effect ’ could even explain why @entity82 , for example , beat older brother @entity83 to become @entity85 leader			0
unmarried cohabiting couples with one child grew from 51 per cent to 53 per cent in the same period , and single parents with one child jumped from 52 per cent to 58 per cent			1
@entity89 , 37 , and his wife @entity91 , 39 , who live in @entity92 with their son @entity93 , 22 months , said they decided to stop at one child because it would give all three of them the best quality of life			2
‘ sometimes i feel there ’s quite a lot of pressure to get a sibling for your child , ’ said mr @entity89			2
‘ people tend to frown on it and some have even told us we are being cruel			0
we have created a good work - life balance and we are very lucky to have a great child			2
‘ introducing a new character into the mix could change that			0
we are conscious that we have to get him socialised			0
we take him to play group almost every day and arrange at least one play date at the weekend			0
’ freelance writer @entity120 , 33 , from @entity121 , who is raising her two - year - old daughter @entity122 on her own , told the @entity123 : ‘ being a single parent with an only child , there ’s not a lot of space for little emperors			2
‘ @entity122 still sleeps in my bed and we have a close bond ... i would hate her to feel pushed out			0
if i had another child there ’s a chance she would feel like that			0
’ academics think that some small families do better because they do not have to share resources – but there are drawbacks			0
professor @entity141 , an expert in social work at @entity143 , said : ‘ research in @entity145 has shown that most children from single child families do exceedingly well			1
‘ however , there is concern about higher suicide rates			0
the pressure on lone children is greater and this can lead to mental health problems			0
’ single child families are n't rare - they are already the most normal size for a family in @entity3 - but the figure is rapidly on the rise hand - me - downs and shared bedrooms will soon be a thing of the past for most - within the next decade , half of all families will have just one child .			1

in seven years , 50 per cent of @entity3 families will have just one child
the number rose from 42 per cent in 2003 , to 47 per cent in 2013
