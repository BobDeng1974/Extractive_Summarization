science minister @entity3 urged his counterparts to impose restrictions , claiming the spread of antibiotic resistance could be as damaging to humanity as climate change			1
he is proposing far - reaching measures that would clamp down on the overuse of antibiotics by gps and hospital doctors			1
he also wants to restrict usage on farms and fisheries , where the drugs are blended with feed to boost yields			1
the minister also called for increased research to find new drugs to fight bacteria , and ways to strengthen cross-border surveillance for emerging resistant strains			2
he told a national newspaper : ‘ across the @entity39 , we should regard the spread of antibiotic resistance as a global challenge that is up there with climate change , water stress and environmental damage , and there are genuine policy consequences that follow from that			1
’ science ministers from across the @entity39 - the world ’s richest and most industrialised nations - met at the @entity52 in @entity53 yesterday			2
it comes just months after @entity56 ’s chief medical officer , dame @entity55 , warned that untreatable infections posed a ‘ catastrophic threat ’ to the population			0
she has asked for antibiotic resistance to be added to the government ’s national risk register , a move that makes the issue easier to raise abroad			1
‘ the soaring number of antibiotic - resistant infections poses such a great threat to society that in 20 years ’ time we could be taken back to a 19th century environment where everyday infections kill us as a result of routine operations , ’ she said			0
drug - resistance is an inevitable consequence of antibiotics			2
the drugs wipe out the vast majority of bacteria causing infections , but a small number will always survive			0
he is proposing far - reaching measures that would clamp down on the overuse of antibiotics by gps and hospital doctors these survivors are the most resistant , and will multiply into a new generation of more resistant organisms			1
in time , they can become immune to even the strongest antibiotics			0
resistant strains of life - threatening @entity93 and @entity94 ‘ superbugs ’ are already on the rise			0
doctors are also seeing ever more resistant strains of @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , which causes pneumonia			0
some 80 per cent of gonorrhoea is now resistant to the frontline antibiotic tetracycline			0
of serious concern is the rise of resistance to powerful drugs called carbapenems , the antibiotics of last resort			2
the first few cases were detected in @entity9 in 2003 , but since then the numbers have soared to 217 cases in the first six months of 2011 .			0
