a two - year - old boy never woke from his routine afternoon nap after being struck down by a mysterious virus , an inquest heard			1
fit and healthy @entity4 is thought to have had a seizure from swelling of his brain as he suffered from an everyday cold			1
hours earlier , @entity4 had been showing off a dance routine for his sister 's friends and cheering on his big brother @entity12 , 12 , at a football match			1
@entity4 , two , from @entity14 , died in his sleep from a swelling to his brain caused by a mystery virus			1
doctors have said there is ' nothing that could have saved him ' his parents @entity22 and @entity23 wept as a coroner heard their written evidence about his sudden death on march 3 , 2013			1
mrs @entity23 , 45 , said @entity4 had been put down for his post-lunch nap at 2pm , and his sister found him dead three hours later			1
she told the coroner : ' i read him a @entity31 story as i put him down for an afternoon nap at 2pm just after his lunch			1
' i told him i loved him and closed the curtains			0
around that time @entity22 came home			0
i had left the door open and thirty minutes later i went back to check on him			0
' he was lying on his tummy and making a little sobbing noise			0
i did n't think much of it as my two other children used to do the same when they were younger			0
' i went in and said to him ' do you want to come down , sweetheart ? ' , but he did n't answer			0
' mrs @entity23 said she was gardening as her husband watched football on tv when their daughter @entity46 , now 14 , screamed			1
they found @entity4 lying ' blue and floppy ' and called an ambulance to their home in @entity53 , @entity14			1
an operator told @entity22 how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( @entity56 )			0
mr @entity4 said : ' i continued fighting for him shouting " come on @entity4 , you can do it " , although i started to feel in my mind that he was gone			1
' encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain			2
@entity61 usually begins with flu - like symptoms , such as a high temperature , a headache and joint pain			0
more serious symptoms may then develop over the next few hours or days , including : flu - like symptoms that rapidly get worse and affect mental state should be treated as a medical emergency			0
in these circumstances , dial 999 immediately and request an ambulance			2
source : @entity76 the parents accompanied their son in the ambulance but he was pronounced dead at @entity80			1
@entity81 heard how the energetic youngster had been playing in the garden and entertaining his sister 's friends who had been on a sleepover hours before his death			1
mrs @entity23 said : ' because of the other children staying , @entity4 was in our bed the night before			1
' we had read bedtime stories and in the morning we had a big hug			0
' we chatted about what we would do that day and i dressed him in his blue dungarees with patterned socks , so i could grab hold of him if he ran off			2
' he was so excited that morning and did a little dance for his sister 's friends			2
' we went to @entity99 to get a coffee and he ate normally			0
then later we went to see his older brother @entity12 play in a football match			2
' i had to wipe his runny nose quite a bit that day , but did n't think much of it			0
' my husband met us at the football field at lunchtime and i remember @entity4 shouting " that 's my daddy " and ran over to him to give him a cuddle			1
' she added that they left to go home for lunch , where @entity4 was put down for the nap from which he never woke up			1
dr @entity116 , a specialist in child neurology at @entity118 , said the cause of @entity4 's death was most likely encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - caused by a virus which triggered a seizure as he slept			1
he said : ' this was a well little boy with a cold , essentially			0
he went down in the afternoon for a nap which is a routine almost every family in @entity128 bears witness to			2
' i would suggest the cause of @entity4 's death to be a seizure during his nap related to encephalitis , caused by an indeterminable virus			1
' there are thousands , if not millions of types of virus and it would be impossible to determine which kind			0
' hours before his death , @entity4 had been in a good mood			2
he woke up to a hug with mother @entity23 , 45 ( right ) , performed a dance for his sister @entity46 ( left ) dr @entity116 added there was ' nothing that could have saved @entity4 '			1
he said : ' the events that afternoon were common events in every household			0
' he ate his lunch , had his nap and must have died within that time			2
' it 's part of nature 's rare unkindness			0
' coroner @entity155 said the cause of death was , on the balance of probabilities , ' inflammation of the brain caused by an indeterminable viral infection '			0
he recorded a verdict of natural causes			0
speaking before the hearing , mr @entity4 said : ' @entity4 loved life , he relished every new experience			2
