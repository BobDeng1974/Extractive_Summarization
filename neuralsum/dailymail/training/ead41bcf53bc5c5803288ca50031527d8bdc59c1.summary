it is fair to say @entity2 fans are not exactly cock - a - hoop over @entity4			1
how does a man sacked from @entity6 in the @entity7 after losing seven of eight games next land the main job at arguably the biggest club outside the @entity12 ? confused , and not a little angry , @entity2 supporters can be forgiven for never having heard @entity4 ’s name before @entity16 owner @entity15 plucked him from obscurity			1
glad to be here : @entity4 poses with @entity2 @entity15 after being appointed head coach shock : @entity21 is the former @entity6 manager , but has been handed a two - year deal at @entity24 @entity25 : @entity26 , november 9 1957 ( age 56 ) playing career : 1975 - 1983 : @entity29 ( 147 apps , 24 goals ) 1983 - 1990 : @entity32 ( 245 apps , 7 goals ) 1990 - 1993 : @entity35 ( 72 apps , 2 goals ) 1993 : @entity38 ( loan ) ( 7 apps , 0 goals ) 1993 - 1995 : @entity42 ( 48 apps , 0 goals ) managing and coaching career : 2000 - 2005 : @entity45 @entity44 coach 2005 - 2007 : @entity45 first - team coach 2007 : @entity48 coach 2007 : @entity50 coach 2007 - 2009 : @entity54 youth team coach 2009 - 2013 : @entity6 2014 - now : @entity2 head coach @entity6 was @entity4 ’s managerial debut and the team ended his first season in the relegation places , only to be saved by @entity60 getting punished with demotion instead for financial irregularities			1
another season of struggle followed before @entity66 owner @entity65 completed a takeover and supplied @entity68 with the division ’s healthiest budget			0
despite this the side finished 10th in consecutive seasons and by this campaign the 56 - year - old was receiving abuse from the stands			1
during a 4 - 1 defeat to @entity80 last october his own supporters sung : ‘ f * * * off @entity81 ’ and ‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ’			1
he managed two more defeats before being given his @entity84			0
but there is another side to that story			0
some observers felt the style of football he implemented – 4 - 3 - 3 , passing – was commendable but players were simply not adequately skilled			0
such tactics might work with a @entity95 squad			0
also , while he possessed big - name players at non-league level accusations were levelled that once they had their pay cheques performing on a saturday came secondary			0
still , it was @entity4 ’s responsibility to motivate			1
an ability to developing players on the coaching field is what @entity2 have trumpeted and his roles at @entity45 and @entity54 are testament to that			2
experience : @entity4 ( left ) during his time as assistant at @entity45 in 2005 with manager @entity113 @entity45 won promotion to the top - flight in 2006 with @entity68 on the staff			1
he had joined with @entity118 manager in 2000 as under - 18 coach and brought through @entity120 among others			2
but @entity122 replaced @entity4 with @entity123 in january 2007 as the team struggled in and he was also dismissed from @entity54 two years later			2
his playing career was largely spent at @entity32 and @entity29 playing as right - back			0
this appointment by @entity128 is as left - field as they come			0

former @entity6 boss @entity81 named @entity2 head coach on a two - year deal
@entity4 ' will assume overall responsibility for the coaching staff and first team playing squad with immediate *effect* '
former @entity50 *midfielder* @entity142 is assistant
@entity144 left by *mutual* consent at end of the season
