by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 05:35 est , 10 september 2013 a pair of ramblers spent nearly an hour trapped on top of a flimsy wooden stile after being cornered by two angry bulls			1
@entity6 and her partner @entity7 were walking in @entity8 , @entity9 , when the aggressive animals blocked their path			1
the couple sat on top of the stile for almost an hour before having to drag themselves through a hedge to safety			2
the pair then decided to wait in the hope the menacing bulls would grow tired and wander off			2
but neither showed any sign of backing down , leaving the couple stuck for 45 minutes			2
they eventually escaped by crawling sideways through a thick hedge between the fields , scratching themselves in the process			0
mr @entity7 filmed their ordeal on his mobile phone to warn others about the aggressive animals			1
the video shows the two bulls snorting and scraping the earth with their hooves , as if poised to charge			0
he says : ' so here we are on a public footpath			1
this is the stile in the middle			0
we ’ve got this bull on this side and this bull on this side			1
' mr @entity7 's wrist was injured when the bull butted him into a fence after he tried to run away terrified : @entity62 said she 'd never encountered anything like it and has now been put off walking ' we ’ve got this bull on this side and this bull on this side ' : the animals surrounded the couple on a public footpath he then points the camera at his wrist to reveal a bloody gash , adding : ' i tried going on this side - this is what the bull gave me when he pushed me into the fence			1
' ms @entity18 said afterwards that the couple had no choice but to claw their way through thick brambles to escape			1
she said : ' it was nearly impenetrable and we got scratched to bits but it was the only option we had			0
' i ’ve never encountered anything like it			0
' we think the bulls were trying to get to each other , but they were snorting , bellowing and pawing the ground and we were stuck in the middle with nowhere to go			0
' it really was quite awful and so terrifying it ’s put me off walking			1
' the couple have complained to the police and local council about the animals			1
experts said the bulls were likely squaring up to fight one another - and the two ramblers were simply caught in the middle			0
the @entity106 said the incident was ' mercifully very , very , rare '			2
spokesman @entity109 said while most farmers take their responsibilities and obligations very seriously , things can very occasionally go wrong			0
he said : ' we do n’t know the exact circumstances about how the bulls ended up in the fields , but what happened sounds pretty traumatic			0
' i ’ve seen and heard bulls bellowing at each other and i would n’t want to be anywhere near that			0
