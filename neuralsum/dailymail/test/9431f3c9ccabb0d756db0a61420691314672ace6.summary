a ' rainbow coalition ' made up of several different parties could cause chaos , @entity0 warned today			0
the @entity5 leader , who hopes to hold the balance of power after may 7 , said the idea of more than two parties forming a government is not ' going to work '			1
he said it would be a ' messy ' way to run the country , and risked instability with the future of the government put in peril with every late night vote			0
mr @entity0 told voters to go to the ballot box on may 7 expecting a hung parliament , with no one party able to secure an overall majority of mps in the @entity27			1
however , he sought to make the case for only the @entity5 working with @entity29 or the @entity30 , without having to rely on mps from other smaller parties			1
recent polls have put the @entity34 and @entity29 almost neck and neck , with seat projections suggesting a two - party coalition might struggle to secure a majority			1
a forecast from pollster @entity41 suggested the likely result on may 7 is a badly hung @entity44			0
it predicted the @entity30 would end up on 297 seats , only slightly down on 2010 , @entity29 262 , the @entity52 35 , @entity5 30 , losing almost half of their mps , @entity50 four and the @entity51 one			1
a second @entity54 - @entity5 coalition would only be able to command a @entity27 majority of four , making it difficult to form a stable government			1
experts have warned a badly hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing			1
@entity64 has already fallen nearly five per cent against the @entity66 dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the general election			0
if neither major party is able to form a stable government , it could send the pound plummeting by a further ten per cent			2
after the 2010 election , @entity29 pm @entity74 tried to pull together a ' rainbow coalition ' of several smaller parties but it failed and the @entity5 entered a power - sharing deal with the @entity34			1
mr @entity0 today joined @entity5 mp @entity79 as they met @entity81 and @entity82 with six week old son @entity84 and @entity85 ( right ) with her six month old daughter @entity86 , during their visit to the @entity89 charity in @entity90 today mr @entity0 said the idea would not have worked then and will not work this time as it would be made up of single issue parties ' puling this way and that '			2
but with opinion polls pointing overwhelmingly towards a hung parliament and significant losses for the @entity5 , it may be the only way mr @entity0 can fulfil his goal of playing a role in the next government			1
the @entity5 leader told his weekly radio phone - in on @entity103 97.3 : ' he ( mr @entity74 ) was sort of very adamant that he thought that one could create a sort of rainbow coalition of lots and lots of different , a sort of smorgasbord of , different parties			1
' i do remember saying , i just do n't think that 's going to work			0
i still do n't think that 's going to work and that might be actually more of a relevant question after may 7			0
' i think this idea that you have a government with a whole array of single issue parties all pulling this way and that , i think it 's a recipe for insomnia as votes will be strung out night after night after night in the @entity126			0
but it 's also a recipe for a messy way of governing the country			0
' pollster @entity41 suggested the likely result on may 7 is a badly hung @entity44			0
it predicted the @entity30 would end up on 297 seats , only slightly down on 2010 , @entity29 262 , the @entity52 35 , @entity5 30 , losing almost half of their mps , @entity50 four and the @entity51 one mr @entity0 said the presence of seven leaders in tonight 's election tv debate was an indication of the likelihood that no party would win an outright majority in 2015			1
but he insisted that having the @entity5 around the cabinet table with either @entity29 or the @entity34 would keep the next government anchored in the centre ground and prevent @entity147 or @entity148 ' lurching one way or another '			1
mr @entity0 said : ' a coalition was not on the ballot paper last time			0
i think what 's different about this election - and it will loom large in tonight 's leaders ' debate - is , i think , increasingly people are acknowledging that no one is going to win outright this time either			0
' so in a sense what you need to choose ... is what party you prefer , but also - which i accept is complex - is which politicians , which parties , would you prefer working together after may 7			2
' he added : ' having @entity5 around the table is a good thing , because we keep the government in the centre ground rather than allowing particularly the two larger parties to lurch one way or the other			2
' pressed on whether he would prefer a deal with @entity29 or the @entity34 , mr @entity0 said his personal views were ' completely irrelevant '			2
he said : ' i do n't think that my whims or wishes or my feelings or my likes or dislikes about this or that other party leader ... they are literally completely irrelevant			2
' the only thing that is relevant is what are the cards that are dealt to us by millions of people doing this wonderful thing , putting a simple cross next to somebody 's name in a ballot box on may 7			0
they will tell us what combination is possible			0
