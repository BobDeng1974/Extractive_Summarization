a grieving mother has branded @entity1 ‘ heartless ’ after it stopped her logging into her dead daughter ’s page			1
when @entity6 ’s 19 - year - old daughter died from a brain tumour , she was devastated			1
but at her lowest points , she found comfort by logging into @entity11 's @entity1 page and reading her old messages			1
however , four weeks ago mrs @entity6 discovered the log in details had been changed			1
and when she challenged @entity1 they told her she could no longer login – due to fears it could invade @entity11 ’s privacy			1
@entity6 , left , discovered the login details to her daughter @entity11 's , right , @entity1 page had been changed and was told she could not login due to fears it could invade her privacy last night the 47 year old nurse said : ' i ca n't believe @entity1 can be so heartless and inconsiderate			1
the loss of my only child has been heartbreaking			0
but at least in my darkest hours i could login to her @entity1 account and read her messages remembering her as the vibrant girl she used to be			1
' @entity11 had no privacy from me - we shared absolutely everything			0
towards the end of her life she could n't write or read more than a few sentences so i used to log in for her and read out to her what her friends were up to			0
but also i fail to see how anyone can invade the privacy of a dead person			2
' mrs @entity6 , a divorcee , began logging into her daughter 's account after she fell ill with a seizure on @entity47 2010			1
mrs @entity6 , a divorcee , began logging into her daughter 's ( the pair are pictured together ) account after she fell ill with a seizure on @entity47 2010 since @entity11 's ( pictured ) death in december 2010 , mrs @entity6 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , continued to login to remove spam comments from the page tragically tests revealed a brain tumour and although her daughter underwent surgery and chemotherapy within six months she had lost her speech and was unable to write or read more than a few words			1
' for the last four months of @entity11 ’s life i used to log into her @entity1 account for her , ' says her mother , who was always a friend with her daughter on @entity1 , ' she loved me to read out messages from all her friends			1
' since her death in december 2010 , mrs @entity6 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , continued to login to remove spam comments from the page			1
mrs @entity6 says @entity1 is ' heartless ' and ' inconsiderate '			1
she said her and her daughter shared everything ' i also gained a lot of comfort from reading all her old messages and conversations with friends before she got ill. when i was feeling desperately low , just logging into her page made me feel so much better			0
i could hear her voice through those conversations and remember how bubbly @entity11 was when she was alive			0
in its official guidelines @entity1 says when a user passes away it is their policy to memorialize all user 's accounts to protect their privacy			1
memorializing an account automatically gives privacy settings which means only confirmed friends can see the profile or locate it in a search			0
@entity93 and friends can still leave posts in remembrance but memorializing an account prevents anyone from logging into it			0
@entity1 requests that if someone is deceased then this information is reported to them by friends or family			2
verified next of kin can submit a special request for a deceased user 's account to be deleted			0
in this case @entity1 will require the family member to provide documentation such as a death certificate			2
' at the same time i would sometimes change her profile photo and remove any spam that had been posted on her wall to keep her page tidy			0
' however at the end of january mrs @entity6 went to log into the page as usual to find the log in details had been changed with a strange message that the page had been ‘ memorialized ’			2
at the same time the page was made only visible to confirmed @entity1 friends			2
she says : ' i felt there must be some mistake as a request for something such as this could only come from the next of kin and i had n’t asked for it			0
' however , when she contacted @entity1 they replied in an email : ‘ unfortunately for privacy reasons , we can not make changes to the profile or provide login information for the account			1
' she says : ' i was angry and devastated as although people can post on the @entity142 , i ca n’t read any of her old conversations nor remove any spam			0
it means her page looks like an uncared for grave with weeds growing on it			0
' people who did not have a @entity1 account or who were n’t friends on @entity1 can now no longer even see the page even though they might want to leave a message of condolence on the @entity142			2
' a @entity1 group has now been set up by 1500 protesters asking for the page to be reinstated as it was			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' many are bereaved parents who ’ve also had their child ’s page ‘ memorialized ’ and like me they are incredibly upset			2
others are desperately worried the same thing could happen to their loved - one ’s facebook page			0
' we just want @entity1 to show some compassion			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' when an account is memorialised then certain profile sections and features are hidden from view to protect the privacy of the deceased			1
' for example , recent statuses are removed , groups the person has joined are hidden , and the person ’s privacy settings are changed to " only friends " so that only his / her friends can see the @entity185			0
' @entity1 ’s policy is not to provide login information for an account to anyone but the account owner to protect their privacy			1
' this means that when we receive a report that a user is deceased we memorialize the account , which restricts profile and search privacy to friends only , but leaves the profile up so that friends and family can leave posts in remembrance			0
' however , we do honor requests from close family members to deactivate the account , which removes the profile and associated information from the site			0

@entity1 told @entity6 she could n't login due to fears it could invade her daughter 's privacy
she said she logged on during her darkest hours to remember her ' vibrant ' daughter
