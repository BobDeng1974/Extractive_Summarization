@entity6 , who took on @entity19 's @entity18 at @entity21 's @entity20 today , does n't lead a flash life , a film - maker said today and a bad weekend involves a bad result from his fantasy football team			1
film - maker @entity25 , who trailed @entity6 around the world for her programme , has lifted the lid on the world of ice baths , early nights and six - hour training sessions that constitute the life of this top flight tennis player			1

' you do n't see anything flash because he does n't do anything flash , ' she told the @entity43			2

' and it all comes back to one word , mentioned by everyone we spoke to - " ordinary "			2
' @entity6 , who today took on @entity19 's @entity18 at the @entity48 at @entity21 's @entity20 , is filmed during a six - hour ' boot camp ' training session in @entity51 , during which he did @entity53 , @entity55 yoga , weights , speed - work and , of course , tennis			1

@entity6 was watched by actor @entity64 and his girlfriend @entity65 at the match in @entity21 today miss @entity25 said his determination and focus on being the best could make @entity6 appear aloof , but said she had been surprised by his manners , wit , and droll sense of humour			1

' there is n't an @entity6 that goes into a press conference and an @entity79 outside of it ; he does n't edit himself			0

@entity6 's hitting partner @entity87 , left , and coach @entity88 , right , watch his game this afternoon the school , which @entity6 attended , was the scene of an appalling massacre in 1996 when gunman @entity93 killed 17 people before shooting himself			0
@entity6 , who has never spoken publicly about the tragedy , sheltered in a classroom during the shooting			0
the film - makers said the visit to @entity105 , during which @entity6 - fresh from a win at the @entity100 - spent hours shyly signing autographs and posing with children , was the most poignant moment during the year			1
in the @entity43 interview , miss @entity25 said : ' it was quietly moving to see how much the @entity6 siblings - his brother @entity110 is also a professional tennis player - mean to that school and the @entity105 community			1

@entity143 sportsman does n't drink , smoke or go out , but he loves his dogs
