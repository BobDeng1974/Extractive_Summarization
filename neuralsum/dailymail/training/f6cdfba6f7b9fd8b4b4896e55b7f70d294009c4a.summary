by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:31 est , 2 april 2013 @entity3 : 14:16 est , 31 december 2013 @entity6 democratic representative @entity5 ' nephew @entity4 was found murdered at age 20 in his home near @entity9 in @entity10 two years ago , shot in the head			1
@entity5 said tuesday during a news conference at the @entity13 that @entity14 has moved too slowly to pass new gun - control measures			1
one place @entity14 should act , he said , is with a law criminalizing so - called ' straw purchasers ' of firearms			2
' @entity20 already think gun trafficking is a federal crime , ' he said , ' but it 's not			1
straw purchasers are individuals who buy guns with the intention of selling them or giving them to others - often to individuals who would not pass background checks administered by the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			2
calling for action : congressman @entity5 cried foul on @entity14 saying that they failed to act quick enough to pass a comprehensive gun law straw purchasing was an element of the @entity38 , @entity40 gun massacre in december that left 20 children and six adults dead at the @entity38			1
mass - murderer @entity43 obtained his weapons from his mother , who reportedly bought them legally			0
it 's unclear if he would have qualified to buy firearms himself , but his history of mental illness , experts say , would have made it unlikely			2
straw purchasing , however , was also an element of the @entity57 administration 's effort to fight drug trafficking along the @entity1 - @entity60 border			1
in @entity61 , the @entity62 and the @entity32 used straw purchasers to ' walk ' guns into @entity60 in an ultimately failed effort to track them to drug cartels			1
the government lost track of those guns , more than 2 thousand of them , including @entity72 rifles			2
and the @entity61 firearms have been linked to hundreds of death in @entity60 , and to the death of at least one @entity1 border patrol agent , @entity61			2
victim : congressman @entity5 ' nephew @entity4 ( pictured ) was found murdered at age 20 in his home near @entity9 in @entity10 @entity5 said his bill would put the federal government out of the straw - purchasing business			1
in other words , it was wrong , ' he said of @entity61 when asked by @entity87			2
' i think everybody agrees that was wrong			0
and yes , the legislation would address that issue			0
' @entity5 has introduced the @entity93 of 2013 , legislation that would increase the penalties for straw - purchasing guns to a maximum of 20 years			1
' bipartisan support for the legislation is growing every day , ' he said			0
vendetta : @entity5 thinks that lawmakers should go after ' straw purchasers ' of guns surveys show that nine out of ten @entity20 , and a majority of @entity106 members , support universal background checks for gun buyers , a measure that would be part of a strategy to limit straw purchasing			1
' i believe fixing the background check system is one of the most common - sense actions we can take to prevent criminals from getting guns , ' @entity5 explained			1
' and i think it would complement our gun trafficking legislation as well			0
' i will fight for that legislation until i die , ' an emotional @entity5 told reporters			2
‘ this is about moving the ball up the floor			0
i do n’t know if we ’ll score 2 points or 3 points			0
’ the @entity106 has been critical of gun control legislation , and gun - rights advocates have pointed out that @entity5 ' nephew was unarmed and in his home when he was killed			1
greater freedom to own his own gun , they say , could have saved his life			0
@entity106 lobbyists are hard at work lobbying in the @entity138 to scuttle much of the @entity140 's preferred legislative package , the @entity135 reported tuesday , by circulating new and weaker bill language to senators			0
that language would use stricter evidentiary requirements for prosecuting straw purchasers in federal court than what @entity5 prefers			1
' i think it basically waters down the bill tremendously			0
' but ' they 're not solid on that language , apparently it 's a draft			0
' tragic : @entity5 ' nephew was unarmed and in his home when he was killed during a q - and - a from reporters , @entity5 resisted every opportunity to criticize the gun lobby for undermining his efforts , aware that the organization would hold a press conference just down the hall when his concluded			1
' you wo n't hear me beating up on the @entity106			0
i want to work with the @entity106 to get something meaningful done , ' he said			0
but @entity5 is dead - set against allowing straw purchasing among ordinary @entity1 citizens			1
' there are only two groups , ' he said of his new legislation ' who should oppose this bill : criminals and people who want to buy guns for criminals			0
' @entity175 and the surrounding counties that @entity5 represents have been hot spots for firearms violence , but it has what an analysis by @entity180 found is the 7th most aggressive state - level gun laws in the country			1
in memory : the @entity185 started their season off with a commemoration of the victims of the @entity38 shooting ' he was an amazing young man with his entire life ahead of him , ' he said of his nephew , then a criminal justice major			2
' it is a painful thing to see your nephew , son or daughter 's blood splattered across the wall			0
' asked if he would support the @entity106 's proposal , expected tuesday morning , to arm a greater number of security guards in @entity1 schools , @entity5 left room for negotiation			1
' having more guns in schools , i do n't think , is necessarily the answer , ' he said			0
' but any jurisdiction that wants to take care of its kids that way , it 's students - i do n't think that 's necessarily a bad proposal			0

representative @entity5 took aim at the practice of straw purchasing guns
that type of gun purchase played a role in both the @entity38 , @entity40 school massacre and the government 's failed @entity61 *program*
