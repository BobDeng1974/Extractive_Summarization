by @entity0 published : 03:05 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 05:49 est , 16 may 2012 it 's not often that the wine makers of @entity3 are left feeling a little bit flat			0
but vineyards across the north of @entity6 are toasting extraordinary success - as climate change makes the region ideal for wine - making			1
just over 25 years ago , @entity11 , near @entity12 , was the most northern vineyard in the world			1
toasting success : @entity16 , who runs the @entity17 , at @entity11 which is planning to double output to 6,000 bottles per year yet as they celebrate their 40th anniversary this year they are planning to double the number of white wines they produce from 3,000 to up to 6,000 per year			1
vineyards across the north of @entity6 have seen demand soar as the quality of their grapes improves - and they are giving their more illustrious @entity31 rivals a run for their money in the sparkling wine stakes			1
as temperatures increase because of climate change , grapes become more acidic			1
but unlike in @entity3 , northern @entity31 , it is not too hot in northern @entity6			1
improved trellis systems and management techniques have also helped @entity42 manufacturers close the gap on their continental rivals			1
@entity45 : the town in northern @entity6 has become the unlikely home of sparkling white wines rivaling those from @entity3 even in @entity45 , @entity50 , vineyards have been able to produce wine with 12 per cent natural alcohol			2
the @entity53 on the outskirts of the northern town started production in 2005 and has rapidly seen its output increase			2
but despite their growing success , their are still only a small number of northern vineyards spread across @entity50 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
across @entity6 , winemakers have seen demand soar in recent years - although until now it has largely been manufacturers in the south getting all the accolades			0
last year , two @entity6 rosés , produced just a few miles from the @entity70 in @entity71 and @entity72 , scooped top international awards at the wine world 's ' @entity74 ' , proving the nation does not need @entity78 heat to turn out a top tipple			2
toasting success : the head gardener works on the vines at @entity11 , @entity63 @entity72 - based @entity83 , the winemaker which provided white wine for prince @entity86 's wedding to @entity87 , picked up a gold medal for its sparkling @entity89 at the @entity90 , the world 's biggest and most important wine competition			0
and just a few miles down the road , @entity93 2010 , produced on the hillsides of @entity95 , @entity71 , beat off stiff competition from more than 360 producers from 21 countries across the globe to win the still rosé gold medal prize			0
@entity16 , who runs the @entity17 , told @entity102 that northern winemakers are giving @entity3 a run for their money			0
' we are cooler than @entity3 , which means we have nicer levels of acid in our grapes			0
that makes for a better sparkling wine , ' he said			0
' we are still relatively young at doing this in comparison with the @entity3 but our techniques are catching up , hence our ability to get better and better wine every year			0
' he added : ' i guess the alarm bells for the @entity3 are ringing because the summers are so much hotter			0
' running scared ? a @entity31 vineyard which is facing unlikely competition from wine makers in the north of @entity6			2

@entity12 vineyard *announces* plans to double production to 6,000 bottles per year
warmer temperatures brought about by climate change have helped northern vineyards close the gap on @entity31 rivals
