depending where you look , @entity0 are anywhere from second to fourth in @entity4 following @entity6 ’s last - gasp winning goal against @entity7			1
level on five points with @entity10 and @entity11 – with @entity7 sailing clear as group winners – @entity0 ’s unusual path in this season ’s competition has caused a few sore heads when it comes to working out exactly where they currently stand in the table			1
ultimately @entity22 rules will dictate whether the @entity25 champions progress or not but as it stands there seems no universal understanding of their position			2
( @entity36 ) @entity22 , @entity38 football 's governing body , use alphabetical order to put @entity0 in third on their website			1
( @entity41 ) the true reflection of the group after five games has @entity0 fourth , behind @entity10 and @entity11 @entity38 football ’s governing body have @entity0 in third on their website – but this appears to contradict their own rules			1
point 7.06 in the latest @entity4 regulations dictates a number of principles in descending order of importance for splitting two or more teams who finish level on points			1
the primary method is to use results drawn from only those teams who are tied			0
so , in this case , @entity7 's results should be eliminated from the calculations			1
@entity6 celebrates the goal which completed his hat - trick against @entity7 on tuesday @entity6 's goals helped @entity0 beat the @entity70 giants after a dramatic finish at the @entity72 that leaves @entity10 and @entity11 ( yet to play their final game against the @entity70 champions ) on five points , but @entity0 effectively on two points – after draws at home to @entity10 and in @entity79 , and with their final game in @entity81 to come and rendered a must - win			1
the second determining factor goes on goal difference , which is needed to separate @entity10 from @entity11			1
given @entity87 side lost 7 - 1 at home to @entity7 , it is fairly easy to see how discarding those results against @entity91 ’s men will benefit them			1
doing so leaves the @entity81 with a goal difference of four , and the @entity93 on minus three			0
so taking all that into account , as it stands , the group should read @entity10 second , @entity11 third and @entity0 fourth			1
that is the consensus among @entity25 media now			0
@entity7 reflect on defeat at @entity0 - but @entity102 are already safely into the knockout stages @entity10 and @entity11 battled out a 1 - 1 draw on tuesday and are currently above @entity0 in the table @entity0 must beat @entity107 's ( centre ) @entity10 in their final group game to stand a chance of progress so why do @entity22 have it @entity10 second , @entity0 third and @entity11 fourth ? the answer : alphabetical order			1
@entity22 only implement their rules once all matches have been played and all head - to - head records can be worked out			1
still not make sense ? well , @entity22 have the teams listed as @entity10 , @entity0 , and @entity11			1
the @entity11 is used to differentiate from @entity11 ’s other sporting teams ( ice hockey , volleyball , basketball etc )			2
so there we have it			0
enough information to make @entity28 ’s brain melt			0
to avoid any embarrassing miscalculations like at @entity7 last year , he should just send out his team to win in the @entity132			2
what we know ... where it gets tricky ... @entity135 there is not a universal system adopted for splitting teams who finish level on points in domestic leagues			0
it ranges across the globe			0
in @entity25 - as @entity0 well know - goal difference is the deciding factor			2
they became the first team to win the @entity148 via that method in 2012 when @entity6 ( him again ) struck in the last minute to beat @entity151			2
@entity0 had the exact same record as rivals @entity153 but a superior goal difference			2
@entity6 celebrates arguably the most famous goal in @entity148 history , which won the title in 2012 @entity159 ’s collapse from three up at @entity160 last year can well be attributed to their frantic pursuit of goals to close the gap on @entity0 , who once again had a better record in that respect			2
the @entity167 uses the same method			0
in @entity171 , head to head is used instead			0
when the three big teams were all close in the table last season it was @entity175 who breathed easier than @entity177 or @entity178 , given their advantageous record			0
as it happened they won @entity182 by three points in any case			0
@entity87 uses head to head also			0
the @entity188 use goal difference , then goals scored , but if teams are still inseparable a play - off decider is staged to determine the champions			0

@entity196 - man @entity7 " gave " @entity0 the win - @entity91			1

@entity0 beat @entity7 3 - 2 in @entity4
city are now tied with @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity4 table
@entity22 place @entity0 third in the table but calculations are complex
in *reality* @entity0 are bottom - @entity22 's table is based on alphabetical order
@entity0 must win at @entity10 in final game to stand any chance of *qualifying*
