mr @entity7 said : ' i ’m not fond of snakes at all , i did n’t even like my @entity38 ’s snake draught excluder			0
' i enjoy running around @entity39 and i have been wondering how to get my speed up - i do n’t have to worry now			0
' he said he spotted the snake at about 6pm on saturday			0
it is believed to be an abandoned pet			1
mr @entity7 , who runs @entity45 , in @entity46 , @entity47 , thought it was a very big adder but experts from the @entity50 confirmed it was a boa constrictor , measuring around 6ft ( 1.8m )			0
@entity52 , site manager for @entity22 , said : ' over the years , we ’ve discovered a number of escaped or unwanted exotic pets at our recreational sites across the region , such as terrapins and koi carp , but never an exotic snake more commonly found in the jungles of @entity62			1
' clearly there is some concern in that we have a snake , of which we know very little , including when it last ate , on the loose in a vast woodland area which is very popular with visitors from across the region			1
' whilst a boa constrictor is unlikely to pose a risk to humans , a lot of people walk their dogs around the site and clearly small dogs could be at a small risk from such a predator			1
' with this in mind , we ’re saying to people , please do come to the site , but please be sensible and exercise caution when out and about , ensuring all dogs are kept on a lead			2
' if you do spot the snake , please let us , the police or the @entity87 know as quickly as possible , and every attempt will be made to safely capture the snake and hopefully return it to its owner			0
' boa constrictors can grow to 12ft ( 3.7m ) long and normally hunt in the dark			0
young boa constrictors need to be fed once a week but older snakes can go without food for up to a month			0
the experts have told @entity22 the reptiles need high temperatures and it may be too cold for it to survive at @entity102			2
remain calm , like @entity103 and @entity104 ... unless you 're a dog @entity106 helps to launch @entity108 's millennium project in 1998 with the help of @entity110 the boa constrictor buffy star @entity112 held a @entity113 at @entity114 earlier this week			0
