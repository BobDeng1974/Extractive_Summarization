by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson the @entity2 second leg was marred by a cigarette lighter being thrown at @entity4 as he headed for the tunnel at half - time but , on the pitch , the @entity8 striker had the last laugh			1
he scored two penalties , the second won by @entity12 , as @entity13 beat @entity13 2 - 0 on the night and 5 - 0 on aggregate to go through to the april 19 final			1
going in at the break at the @entity18 , a yellow cigarette lighter flew through the air and hit the @entity21 captain on top of his head			2
bouncing clear : @entity24 ( right ) has n't realised that the lighter has struck @entity4 in the head incoming : the yellow lighter can be seen hurtling through the air towards @entity4 's head oblivious : @entity24 ( centre ) , @entity30 ( right ) and @entity4 are entirely unaware as the missile is thrown hitting home : the lighter lands on top of @entity4 's crown with some force withdrawal : @entity4 was taken off in the 75th minute for wonderkid @entity38 @entity13 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 46 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 46 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 61 ) , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 booked : @entity41 @entity59 : @entity60 , @entity24 ( @entity61 46 ) , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity30 , @entity65 ( @entity66 67 ) , @entity12 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity4 ( @entity38 75 ) subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 booked : @entity62 , @entity74 , @entity4 goals : @entity4 7 ( pen ) , 16 ( pen ) @entity4 was walking off alongside team - mates @entity24 and @entity30 , who showed concern as the striker clutched his head after impact			1
the missile was thrown from a section of the home support as players from both sides passed down into the tunnel			0
@entity12 , meanwhile , emulated @entity89 by reaching the @entity2 final in his first season at @entity59			1
@entity89 ’s first and only cup final in @entity93 was against @entity94 which @entity13 lost 3 - 2 in extra time despite the then @entity97 captain scoring with a first - half free - kick			2

@entity89 ’s assist count in the league was up to eight in the 32 games he played ; @entity12 has only played nine full matches for @entity13 but has nine assists			0
the £ 86million man was brought down in the box by @entity42 and @entity4 scored from the spot doubling @entity59 's lead on the night after the @entity8 forward had won and dispatched the first penalty			1
painful : @entity4 clutches at his head after the lighter bounces away as the players make their way down the tunnel @entity126 shot : @entity4 ( left ) celebrates with @entity12 after opening the scoring pick that one out : @entity4 and @entity59 were off to a flyer at the @entity18 milestone : @entity12 has reached a @entity2 final in his first season in the capital - like @entity89 ( right ) @entity40 pushed a @entity12 free - kick round his post in one of @entity59 ’s best second - half chances but the tie had been won a week earlier in the @entity138			1
@entity13 reaching the cup final also means @entity140 repeats @entity142 ’s feat in his first season in charge of @entity59			0
@entity142 also met @entity100 in the final and won his first trophy thanks to an extra-time header from @entity4			2
@entity13 ’s two goals in the @entity18 took @entity140 closer to another of @entity142 ’s milestones			0
@entity59 scored 100 goals under the current @entity153 manager in just 42 games but @entity140 ’s @entity13 have now scored 98 in the @entity156 ’s first 37 matches			0
@entity4 hit a shot straight at @entity40 to just miss out on his hat - trick and was substituted midway through the second half			2
cutting in : real playmaker @entity68 nips across to try and prevent @entity49 getting his shot away surge : @entity12 looks up as he tries to carve out an opening in @entity13 almost there : @entity4 spurns his opportunity to bag yet another hat - trick for @entity59 words of wisdom ? @entity12 talks to @entity4 during the match against bitter rivals @entity13 @entity13 could now face punishment from the league for the missile thrown at the @entity59 striker , although the precedents for action being taken against clubs in such circumstances will not encourage those who want tough action			1
@entity181 ’s side will now concentrate on the league , the @entity182 and getting back key injured players			0
they had full back @entity44 taken to hospital with a cervical sprain after falling on his head and twisting his neck after jumping for a header with @entity4 who was booked			0
in the first leg last wednesday , @entity59 left back @entity193 and his young son were reportedly targeted with racist taunts from the travelling @entity13 fans as the @entity198 defender warmed down following the ill - tempered game at the @entity138			0
giant leap : @entity4 beats @entity41 ( left ) and @entity42 in an aerial battle during the clash raging : the @entity13 fans are on their feet after @entity4 nets from the penalty spot			1

@entity59 striker hit in the head during 5 - 0 aggregate *victory*
@entity4 had netted twice from the penalty spot to give @entity59 2 - 0 lead
