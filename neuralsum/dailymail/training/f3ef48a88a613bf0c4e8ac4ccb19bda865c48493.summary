by @entity0 @entity1 may be spending the summer without a club , but he still knows he has to keep fit if he 's to find a place in a @entity6 squad			1
the @entity8 striker , unable to secure a new contract at @entity10 at the end of last season , has been working out on his own and with friends , and posting the pictures on his @entity16 page			1
@entity1 played three - a - side cage football in @entity18 , and put a post-match picture online , as well as a video doing a ladder run behind a goal			2
boys : @entity1 posted this post-training picture to @entity16 with the hashtag # withmyboys caged footballer : the striker played some three on three football in a cage while in @entity18 on the run : the 26 - year - old striker gets running to show off his famous quick feet since leaving @entity10 the 26 - year - old has received interest from the likes of @entity36 and @entity37 , but his high wage demands have so far proved a stumbling block			1
the videos could attract more interest			0
@entity42 offered potential clubs a series of videos proving his fitness in 2011 , leading to being signed by @entity47			0
however , @entity1 , who has been using his @entity16 to post rather more controversial pictures over the summer , might not be so lucky unless he drops his asking price			0
putting in the hard yards : another video shows the striker keeping his fitness up with a longer run give me a chance : @entity1 scored 44 times in his @entity10 career , and has had several loan spells alternative use : @entity1 has mostly been using his @entity16 account to post more shocking pictures			0
