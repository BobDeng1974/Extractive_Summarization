@entity1 playmaker @entity0 is hungry for more goals after filling a void for the champions by striking twice against @entity5			1
the @entity6 helped @entity1 overcome the absence of any recognised strikers by setting up a comfortable 3 - 0 @entity10 win at the @entity11 with a second - half double			1
@entity13 completed the scoring in the latter stages as @entity1 pulled level with @entity17 at the top of the table			1
@entity0 races off after finally breaking down the stubborn @entity5 defence with a slightly fortunate shot @entity1 were without forwards @entity23 , @entity25 and @entity26 due to injury and so played with midfielder @entity28 as a lone striker with @entity0 just behind him			1
@entity0 revelled in the central role , hitting a deflected opener four minutes after the restart and turning in a second from close range on the hour			1
despite all his creative brilliance and technical excellence , @entity0 is not a renowned goalscorer but he enjoyed the role on saturday			1
@entity0 ( right ) struck his second goal after the interval to send the champions right back into the title race @entity0 celebrates his second goal of the day as @entity1 cruise out to a 2 - 0 lead on saturday afternoon the 28 - year - old told @entity47 : ' i have always said that i like to play in the middle and every time i play there i try to score goals , as when i play wide , but i prefer a central position			1
' i was able to score two goals and help the team , so i am very happy			2
' without strikers we have to work a bit more on trying to score goals and we did that , as in the last game , so hopefully we can continue like this			2
' @entity1 trailed @entity17 by eight points at the end of last month but confidence is now soaring after a run of eight successive wins in all competitions			1
@entity1 players celebrate @entity0 's goal as they move level on points with @entity17 at the top of the table attention now shifts to @entity17 's response as they play their game in hand at @entity79 on monday			1
@entity0 said : ' we know that we have to play a lot of games during this month and that we have to try to get as many points as we can			2
' so let 's see if they drop some points and we can put some pressure on them			2
' @entity1 dominated possession throughout against @entity5 but the visitors , for whom @entity90 impressed , had some good opportunities in a goalless first half , notably when @entity95 put a close - range overhead kick wide			1
@entity0 holds up his international cap award ( left ) and his man of the match award ( right ) from saturday @entity1 failed to get any of their eight first - half attempts on target - with @entity100 going the closest - but stepped up a gear after the break			1
@entity103 was ultimately routine but @entity5 manager @entity104 had justifiable complaints after @entity106 had a headed goal , when the score was 2 - 0 , incorrectly ruled out for offside			1
@entity104 felt @entity5 might have made more of a game of it had that been given but he also conceded , after just one win in 11 , that his side lacks firepower			2
@entity104 said : ' we do n't score enough goals , that is true to say			0
we had opportunities and could n't get on the sheet			0
but if they get chalked off when they are good ones , you have n't got much chance have you ? @entity5 manager @entity104 was furious @entity106 had a headed goal ruled out for offside ' i think we have got some good strikers but , if i am honest , i just think we need something a little bit different , either from the bench or more of a physical presence			2
' ( @entity133 ) @entity132 has tried his best over the last few weeks but with him being out , i think we just lack that physical ( presence )			0
' all the other lads have got their attributes , it is just to supplement what we have got and give us more options off the bench			0
' the chief reason @entity5 were shut out at @entity11 was because of the improved defensive resilience of @entity1 , who have now kept four successive clean sheets			2
@entity148 back @entity146 ( 2nd left ) believes he is settling in well in the @entity10 three of those have come without captain @entity151 and the shakiness evident earlier in the season is starting to disappear			0
centre back @entity146 said : ' it is always important for us to keep a clean sheet			0
' i think we are not making as many mistakes as we did one or two months ago			0
we need to keep going and continue that run			0
we need to defend well and score goals like we do at the moment			0
' @entity146 himself had a difficult introduction after his Â£ 32million summer move from @entity165 but is now looking a stronger proposition			0
he said : ' it is true that i had difficulties to adapt at the beginning , but i was expecting that and was prepared			0
i did n't have any moment of doubt			0
the more games i play , the more i am settling in			0
