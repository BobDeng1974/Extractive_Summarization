@entity0 has triumphed in the battle of the rosbifs after a @entity4 celebrity butcher declared its steaks the best in the world			1
grass - fed @entity0 cattle has long been regarded as a cut above that produced by other nations , but now the leaders in the world of gastronomy have declared it the winner			2
@entity4 ’s most famous butcher , @entity17 , also declares that the only way to save @entity4 cows is for them to sleep with the enemy and breed with @entity0 cows			1
@entity4 ’s most famous butcher , @entity17 ( pictured ) has angered his fellow countrymen by claiming @entity0 beef steaks are better than @entity4 ‘ we have lost the notion in @entity4 of what a good steak is in fact , we simply do n’t know what it is any more , ’ he said			1
‘ the best rearers in the world are the @entity0			2
’ but his remarks have not gone down well in the country that considers itself to be the world capital of gastronomic genius			0
@entity38 has been expelled by the @entity4 butchers ’ federation , who released a statement saying it was ‘ amazed at the media exposure given to a figure who has distinguished himself as a detractor of @entity4 rearers and is a paid - up supporter of @entity0 farmers			1
’ in a feature - length documentary , steak ( r ) evolution , @entity38 travels the world from the @entity52 to the @entity54 ranches of @entity55 in search of the world ’s perfect sirloin			0
the butcher is notorious in @entity4 for refusing to sell to @entity61 - starred chefs and instead reserving his finest cuts for ordinary @entity63 at his four shops in and around the city			1
he previously outraged @entity4 culinary connoisseurs when he co-founded a @entity68 steak house called @entity69 serving only @entity0 cuts			1
in the documentary , he argues that @entity4 ’s three main breeds of cattle - @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 - are tough ‘ athletic ’ animals bred for work and milking but not for meat			1
@entity38 said @entity0 breeds like the @entity80 ( pictured ) , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , when grass - fed make the perfect steak due to a marbling effect which produces tender and flavoursome beef but the @entity0 breeds @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , when grass - fed , make the perfect steak due to the marbling effect which produces tender and flavoursome beef			2
‘ we ’ve only really been eating grilled meat in @entity4 for the past 30 years , whereas you rosbifs we been doing so since the 16th century and have bred cows for that very purpose , so it ’s only natural you have had a head start , ’ the film ’s producer @entity91 told @entity93			1
‘ our breeds are fine for stews , boeuf bourguignon and pot au feu as they have a lot of collagen , which is good for boiling , but a little fat			0
a good @entity107 roast beef can be eaten alone - you add nothing			0
’ he is also calling for the @entity4 to crossbreed their cows to improve the quality of the country ’s beef			2
‘ this is precisely what we did in wine : we privileged terroir - local soil - over grape variety			0
today we have many grape varieties in one area , ’ he added			0
@entity121 , a food critic and co-founder of @entity123 , a popular restaurant guide , said that he thought people should eat less meat and favour grass - fed - the film ’s main message			0
but he said he was ‘ wary of @entity133 figures ’ such as @entity134 , because the @entity4 were used to their national style of beef			2
‘ a @entity4 against the @entity4 in the name of meat ? that ’s like @entity138 against the @entity139			0
in @entity4 we say you should be brave , but not foolhardy .			0
