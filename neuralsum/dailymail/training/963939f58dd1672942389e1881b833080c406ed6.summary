by @entity0 last updated at 2:27 pm on 6th october 2011 a 14 - year - old boy is being held in a harsh prison cell on the holiday island of @entity4 for drug possession - one of the youngest foreigners to be arrested in @entity7			1
the young @entity8 faces up to 12 years in jail after being arrested for allegedly being in possession of 6.9 grams of marijuana			2
the teenager , who was on holiday with his parents and friends , was said last night to be crying in his cell at @entity18 's police headquarters			1
holiday resort : the teenager is believed to have been approached by a drug dealer near to @entity22 in @entity4 @entity24 's @entity23 said it had been told by a source on the island that the boy bought the marijuana because he felt sorry for a man who gave him a hard luck story			1
the source said the boy was on his way to get a massage near the famous @entity22 holiday strip when he was approached by a dealer who asked him to buy the drug because he needed the money to buy food			2
the boy , who comes from the city of @entity42 , 100 miles north of @entity24 , is believed to have paid the equivalent of Â£ 15 for the marijuana			0
he went on his way to have the massage and he was arrested shortly afterwards			0
it is not known whether the dealer had ' shopped ' the teenager to the police as part of a sting			1
jailed : @entity51 in @entity18 before her trial			0
she is serving a 20 year sentence for drug smuggling in @entity7 under @entity7 's harsh narcotics laws , drug possession carries a maximum of 12 years behind bars			1
the country 's prisons are notorious for their bleak conditions			2
scores of foreigners have been arrested in @entity4 for drug possession but the teenager is believed to be one of the youngest - if not the youngest ever			0
because there are no children 's courts and very few children 's jails in @entity7 , juveniles are dealt with in adult courts and if convicted end up in adult jails			1
his only ' respite ' is the fact that under law , any case against a child offender must be presented to prosecutors within a month of arrest , as opposed to 90 days in adult cases			2
the two highest profile cases in recent years have involved @entity8			0
one involves the so - called ' @entity86 ' who are serving long jail sentences - and two are fighting the death sentence - for heroin smuggling			0
