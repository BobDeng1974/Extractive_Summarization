' the message is simple			2
we have given ourselves a fantastic chance , and we have to make sure we take our chance again in june , ' he said , after @entity24 's brilliant brace in @entity41			0
' the @entity43 game becomes massive now			0
if you can win that game , then it would be hard to think we wo n't get to the @entity47			1
it takes on extra significance			0
do we feel 18 points will be enough ? possibly			1
' if we can get to 15 points with four games to go , that has to be our target at this moment in time			2
we will have the chance to go top of the group against @entity19			0
' the game comes at an awkward time , with the @entity62 and @entity63 seasons having broken up for the summer , but @entity0 hopes that does not have a major impact			1
@entity24 scores with a header to make the score 2 - 0 during their win over @entity11 in @entity15 @entity2 are currently second in @entity15 , behind @entity19 , and have 12 points from five games he is relying on dedication from his players and two friendlies - one against @entity76 on may 31 and another against @entity77 - to get his side in shape			1
the @entity77 game has yet to be confirmed by the two associations , but @entity0 is already treating it as a done deal			1
we have two good warm - up games before that so preparation will be excellent , ' he said			2
' our preparation in june will be vital , and the warm - up games against @entity76 and @entity77 will be crucial			2
but players finish their seasons in may , and there is an onus on certain players to maintain their own fitness			0
' if fit @entity96 is sure to become his country 's most capped outfield player in that run of fixtures , with his current tally of 95 leaving him level with @entity104			0
he had to make do with bench duty against @entity11 , with @entity0 making the tough choice to pair @entity107 and @entity108 in the middle while favouring @entity110 at right - back			1
@entity0 believes a win on june 13 would go a long way to ensuring a first major tournament in 30 years they are second in @entity15 , four points clear of @entity17 and just a point shy of table - topping @entity19 ' leaving out @entity96 was maybe the most difficult decision i have had to make in my three years , in terms of team selection , ' the manager confessed			1
' everyone knows what @entity96 is about and what his qualities are as a player and individual			0
i sat with @entity96 a few nights ago and talked about his situation at @entity132			0
' he has n't played much club football in recent tines , and he fully understood where i was coming from			0
and @entity96 being @entity96 , he took it in his professional style			0
he is still a huge part of this squad , but now we have competition for places which is good			0
' @entity107 ( @entity142 ) showed what a top class player he is , and he showed it at @entity146 against @entity147 the other night			0
' but it is only a matter of time before @entity96 gets his 96th cap and goes on to win 100			2
