' [ @entity11 's position is that ] you can never have a big enough closet , ' ms @entity11 's spokesperson told @entity23 , while admitting that her client is seriously considering doubling her current 3,000 sq ft closet size			2

" ' in august , ms @entity11 's closet - turned - cave hit the headlines after a burglar broke into the space and stole a selection of her most expensive accessories , handbags and jewelry , including a priceless locket which contains a piece of her late son 's hair			2
