by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 will tonight launch a pre-election attack on the @entity4 , accusing his coalition partners of ‘ political opportunism ’ and threatening the recovery by blocking a referendum on @entity9			1
the @entity11 chancellor will use a speech to business leaders to warn @entity15 ’s position of remaining in the @entity16 under any circumstances is taking a ‘ risk with our economy ’			1
mr @entity2 will also attack @entity22 's ' threat ' to school standards and take a swipe at the @entity4 for making ‘ unaffordable and undeliverable ’ promises to scrap tuition fees before the last election			0
@entity2 has said @entity27 is a threat to the economy , but today claimed the @entity4 ' attitude to @entity9 was also damaging prosperity hours before polling stations open for local and @entity34 elections tomorrow , mr @entity2 will make a series of coded attacks on the party he has shared power with for the last four years			1
in a speech to the @entity42 dinner in @entity43 , the chancellor will warn of several long term risks to national prosperity			1
he will tell pro-european business leaders that while they say there are risks to leaving the @entity16 now , there are also dangers with agreeing to remain a member under any circumstances ‘ it is true that those who want @entity55 to leave the @entity16 now , instead of working to reform it , are taking a risk with our economy			1
’ in a direct attack on the @entity4 position , he will added : ‘ those who advocate membership of this union , whatever the direction it heads in and regardless of the costs it imposes on our businesses , are also taking a risk with our economy			0
@entity71 , visiting a newly - built council housing complex in @entity73 today , is a threat to teaching standards , claimed the chancellor ‘ on its current course , the @entity16 is pricing our continent out of the global economy			1
’ @entity16 regulations are estimated to cost the @entity55 alone up to £ 27 billion a year , and the @entity11 have a plant to reverse the ‘ direction of centralising power and loading ever higher costs on the @entity9 economy ’ , mr @entity2 will say			1
‘ for that direction is destroying jobs , killing innovation , and with it , calling into question the legitimacy of the @entity16 itself			2
‘ and for those who say that a referendum creates uncertainty , i say : a referendum is the only way to resolve the uncertainty that already hangs over @entity55 ’s relationship with @entity9			1
’ the @entity4 have refused to match the @entity11 pledge to renegitaite @entity55 ’s @entity16 membvership before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
mr @entity2 will also go on the attack over tuition fees , striking at the heart of the issue which has caused mr @entity15 more pain than any other			2
after promising to abolish tuition fees before the 2010 election , the @entity4 then backed trebling them to £ 9,000 because both neither the @entity11 or @entity22 would agree with their policy			0
mr @entity2 will claim the quality of education is a risk to the economy , and argue @entity11 reforms to free schools , exams and a greater emphaisis on maths , science and engineering are under threat			0
‘ for the first time in two decades there is now a determined effort underway in @entity55 to reverse the decline of educational standards – and give children the quality of schooling this modern age demands			2
‘ all this is a massive change for the better in the education system of our country – a change whose benefits will be felt in 10 , 20 , 30 years time as today ’s children find themselves better equipped to get good careers ; and tomorrow ’s businesses find themselves better able to recruit a world - class workforce			0
‘ but these education reforms , pursued until now by parties of the right and left , are under threat – from vested interests , from the unreconstructed teaching unions , and from the political opportunism of promising students the unaffordable and undeliverable			0
’ reneging on the tuition fees pledge in autumn 2010 proved to be the most damaging decision mr @entity15 has made in coalition			2
his poll ratings slumped and have never recovered			0
the party face losing hundreds of councillors and several meps in tomorrow ’s elections			0
a senior @entity4 source dismissed the attack as an attempt to divert attentions from @entity11 divisions : ' the conservatives are hopelessly split on @entity9 and openly flirting with exit , which would destroy @entity55 jobs			1
@entity4 are the only party standing up for @entity55 jobs and our place in @entity9			1
@entity15 , today out delivering leaflets in @entity170 , has claimed leaving the @entity16 would cost millions of jobs ' we want to change the @entity16 for the better , to cut waste and boost trade , but we know the best way to do that is to be there getting stuck in , not complaining from the sidelines , ' the source added mr @entity2 will also attack the anti-business alliance of @entity22 and the ‘ @entity182 ’ – a reference to @entity27			1
he is expected to accuse the pair of wanting to ‘ pull up the drawbridge and shut @entity55 off from the world ’			2
the chancellor will say : ‘ they want to constrain foreign investment in our economy , and deprive us of the @entity55 jobs that it has created in industries from car manufacturing to energy , ’ he will tell the @entity42			2
‘ they want to set prices , regulate incomes , impose rent controls , wage war on big business , demonise wealth creation , renationalise industries – and pretend that they can re-establish control over all aspects of the economy			0
‘ whether from the @entity208 or the populist @entity182 , we now see a deeply pessimistic , depressing , anti-business agenda			0
’ mr @entity2 ’s remarks are designed as a trenchant attack of the economic policies of @entity22 ’s @entity71 and @entity213 , who have unsettled business leaders with a series of 1970s - style policy proposals			0
but it is also a provocative riposte to those in his own party and @entity27 who have expressed concern about foreign take - overs – most recently the stalled @entity225 bid for @entity55 - based drugs firm @entity226 .			0
