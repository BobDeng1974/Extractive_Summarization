a @entity1 father has found a novel way to get his children to change the loo roll in the toilet			1
@entity6 who has been trying to instruct his children , @entity8 and @entity9 on household chores decided that the only way his children would listen to him was if he posted the video online			1
this is the first in what he describes as a ' series of instructional videos to help them with life			1
' ' obviously me telling them face - to - face is not working , ' the exasperated father says			1
' so i 've tried to be creative and i 've come up with the idea of using social media to try and reach you			0
' this first instructional video is number one in the series â€“ how to change the toilet roll			1
' i know this is a difficult one so , @entity9 and @entity8 , please pay attention			0
' he then turns the camera to a toilet roll holder with an empty roll on it before panning to a fresh , new roll on the window ledge			0
beginning his step - by - step instructions , the dad then says : ' the first thing you 've got to do is you 've got to find a new toilet roll			1
' he means business : will @entity6 filmed the video to show his children how to change loo roll			1
this is the first in a series of ' instructional videos ' the camera then pans down to the toilet roll holder			1
' second thing is , this is the toilet roll holder , ' he continues			0
' now as you can see guys , there 's an empty one already on there			2
' so the first thing you have to do is remove this empty one , ' he says , reaching out to the toilet roll holder			0
' like this , ' he says , demonstrating how it 's done as he slips it off the holder			2
the camera zooms in on a close - up of the fresh loo roll on the window ledge the offending item : the empty loo roll holder waiting to be restocked			2
the video received over 200,000 views in three days speaking in utmost seriousness , he continues with his guidance			1
' and then we take the toilet roll			0
' at this point the camera pans to the top of the window ledge and the father 's hand is seen reaching for the roll			2
the camera then pans down again , as he says , ' and we place it on there , ' as he slides the fresh new roll onto the toilet roll holder			0
' like that , ' he exclaims in tones of triumph			0
but the father has n't finished with his instructions as he goes on to tell his children that there is one more step to the task			2
demonstration : @entity6 takes off the loo roll and ends the instructional video by thanking his children for watching ' make sure you watch that a few times as the advance level would be to take the empty toilet roll holder and put it in the bin , ' he says drily			1
' but i feel that might be just a step too far at the moment , ' he says , bringing the camera back to his face , ' so we 'll keep it as is at the moment			0
' ' thank you very much for watching			0
' the video was first posted on a private family group before being publicly shared online			2
' my kids said this would n't go world - wide as no one would be interested ! i guess there are other parents out there that feel the same as i do ' , he posted on @entity129			0
' i jokingly said to my kids that i would post it wider if they did n't start being more tidy , ' mr @entity6 told @entity131			1
' they said to go ahead as i was n't funny and no one would be interested			0
' the clip however has gone viral , receiving over 200,000 views in three days .			1
