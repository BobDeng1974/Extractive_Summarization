by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 15 august 2013 apples are losing their crunch and becoming sweeter because of global warming , according to @entity5 scientists			1
@entity6 gathered from 1970 to 2010 at two orchards in @entity5 provides clear evidence that climate change is having an effect on apple taste and texture , said the research team			1
‘ all such changes may have resulted from earlier blooming and higher temperatures ’ during the growth season , they wrote in the journal @entity16			0
analysing data gathered from 1970 to 2010 at two orchards in @entity5 , a research team said there was clear evidence that climate change was having an effect on apple taste and texture about 60 million tonnes of apples are produced every year , making it the world 's third most popular fruit			1
previous studies had shown that global warming was causing apple trees to flower earlier , and that harvests were also affected by changes in rainfall and air temperature			1
the orchards used in the study produce the @entity41 and @entity42 apples , the two most popular kinds in the world			2
the farms are located in @entity5 's @entity47 and @entity48 regions , which had seen a mean air temperature rise of 0.31 and 0.34 ° c , respectively , per decade			1
previous studies had shown that global warming , which many believe is caused by carbon emissions , was causing apple trees to flower earlier , and that harvests were also affected by changes in rainfall and air temperature the orchards were chosen because there had been no changes in cultivars or management practices for extended periods			1
the analysis showed a decrease in acidity , firmness and watercore , but a rise in sugar concentration this ruled out non-climate factors like technological improvements in the apple change			1
the data collected over the years included measurements of acid and sugar concentration , fruit firmness and watercore - a disease that causes water - soaked areas in the flesh of an apple			2
the analysis showed a decrease in acidity , firmness and watercore , but a rise in sugar concentration over time			1
‘ we think that a sweeter apple is a positive thing and a loss of firmness is a negative thing , ’ co-author @entity89 of the @entity90 in @entity91 told @entity92			2
‘ we think most people like sweet and firm apple fruits , although everyone has his own taste			0
a soft apple is called ' @entity103 ' in @entity5 which means a dull or senile fruit			2
’ the study said that the results ‘ suggest that the taste and textural attributes of apples in the market are undergoing change from a long - term perspective , even though consumers might not perceive these subtle change			0
’ the research claims to be the first to measure changes in the taste and texture of food as a result of climate change			0
a @entity123 government study released last year identified the top 100 effects of climate change and how they may surprisingly impact @entity123 in the next century			0
it found that warmer water temperatures would mean sole and plaice will be more plentiful in the @entity123 , though cod and haddock will move to cooler climates			0
sugar beet yields could rise by up to 70 per cent and wheat yields by as much as 140 perc ent by mid-century due to longer growing seasons if water and nutrients are available			0
‘ a warmer climate presents opportunities to grow new crops such as soya , sunflowers , peaches , apricots and grapes , while new markets may open up overseas for @entity123 grown produce , ’ the study said .			0

this is based on data gathered from 1970 to 2010 at two orchards in @entity5
the farms had seen an air temperature rise of 0.31 and 0.34 ° c per decade
apples were found to have less acidity and firmness but were sweeter
