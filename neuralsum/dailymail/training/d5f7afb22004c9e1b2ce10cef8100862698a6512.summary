preachers of hate will be banned from public speaking or spreading their poison on social media , under sweeping new powers unveiled today			1
home secretary @entity6 says the fanatics are creating an ‘ environment ’ where acts of violence become acceptable and they must be silenced			1
the @entity11 – which have been dubbed @entity12 for hate clerics – will target the likes of @entity15 , who for years has spread bile at public meetings or on the internet			1
in the past , the rules could have applied to spokesmen for @entity31 , such as @entity32			2
the restrictions placed on the hate preachers will be backed by criminal punishments and a possible jail term			1
they could include a ban on speaking at public events			1
anything they want to put on social media would have to be cleared by the authorities in advance , and the fanatics could also be banned from attending specific events and told who they can associate with , in powers that are similar to the now defunct control orders			1
also , they could be stopped from taking positions of responsibility , such as in schools , where they could spread their message			2
in a separate move , new banning orders will target extremist groups in order to make it easier to force them to disband			2
mrs may said hate preachers had been operating on the ‘ very margins ’ of the criminal law , which was designed to tackle incitement to acts of terrorism			1
she now wants to target the extreme views whipped up by the fanatics which can lead to violence			1
the @entity11 – which have been dubbed @entity12 for hate clerics – will target the likes of @entity15 ( above ) , who for years has spread bile at public meetings or on @entity77 and other websites in an exclusive interview , she told the @entity80 : ‘ it creates the environment in which that sort of thinking appears to be acceptable			1
‘ of course we want to maintain free speech but we do not want to see incitement			1
’ mrs may also warned of the dangers of sharia courts operating in @entity20 which do not work to ‘ @entity20 values ’			2
the home secretary said she been given examples of sharia courts passing verdicts on women trying to flee violent or abusive relationships which did not amount to ‘ fair treatment ’			1
she wants @entity99 women to be reassured that they have recourse to the @entity20 legal system and do not have to accept unjust verdicts			2
a crackdown on ‘ absurd ’ human rights rulings which threaten to hamper @entity20 troops carrying out vital missions was last night signalled by the defence secretary			1
@entity108 said he was ‘ appalled ’ that legal challenges over incidents that happened in @entity111 and @entity112 have cost the taxpayer £ 85million – money which could have been spent on new kit			2
the government wants to restrict judgments which decree that the @entity118 applies on the battlefield			2
mr @entity108 said the prospect of health and safety - style laws could seriously impact on @entity20 ’s military capability			2
a series of court rulings in both @entity20 and @entity127 have extended the reach of human rights laws over military actions and , critics say , open the door of claims against the government			1
mr @entity108 said : ‘ i ’m appalled			0
it ’s not just being used , it ’s being abused			0
we already have military law and we already have international humanitarian law , we certainly do not need @entity127 law in this area hamstringing the efforts of our armed forces			0
’ he added : ‘ we ’ll end up with every platoon taking a legal adviser out on patrol and that is quite simply unacceptable			0
’ stepping into what is a sensitive area , mrs may said : ‘ there are good sharia courts but we need to look that all sharia courts are operating within @entity20 values			0
’ the so - called @entity155 targeting hate clerics would be issued by the courts as a civil power , following an application by the police			1
there will be a right of appeal to the @entity164			0
the authorities would have to show , on the ‘ balance of probabilities ’ , that the individual ‘ is undertaking , has undertaken , or proposes to undertake activities that spread , incite , promote or justify hatred against a person or group of persons on the grounds of that person ’s or group of persons ’ disability , gender , race , religion , sexual orientation , and / or transgender identity ’			0
the move is likely to draw fierce criticism from civil liberties groups and some mps , given that the people targeted will not have been convicted of any crime			0
the @entity190 are also certain to object to such a dramatic step , but mrs may insists the powers are necessary			0
they will be included in the @entity195 manifesto with the intention of being passed shortly after the election			0
the powers will sit side - by - side with the banning orders , which also address the problem of groups which operate on the fringes of criminal law			0
in her speech to the @entity195 conference in @entity206 today , mrs may will also announce that the @entity207 is taking control across @entity134 of tackling @entity210 extremism			1
currently , responsibility is shared with the @entity212 run by @entity213			0
schools and other public bodies will be told they have an obligation to promote @entity20 values to try to prevent a repeat of the @entity206 schools ‘ trojan horse ’ plot			0
politicians have for years warned of the dangers posed by hate preachers such as @entity15 and his former mentor @entity225 , but have not produced a solution for those who know the boundaries of the criminal law			1
officials believe that , in an era of social media , it is vital to find a solution			0
last week @entity15 was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a banned terrorist group but was then released within 48 hours			0
he claimed his arrest had been ‘ politically motivated ’ ahead of the vote for the @entity20 to join military action against the @entity239 in @entity240 .			0

@entity6 will ban preachers of hate from spreading their poison *online*
said the @entity11 will also stop them publicly speaking
claims fanatics are creating ' environment ' where violent acts are acceptable
home secretary said : ' we want free speech but we do not want incitement '
