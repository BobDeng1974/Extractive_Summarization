for years it ’s been thought that snakes lost regions in their bodies such as their neck , as they evolved from four - legged lizard ancestors into their sinuous shape			1
but by looking at subtle differences in the shapes of snakes ’ vertebrae bones , palaeontologists believe they have shed new light on how the creatures evolved their legless bodies			1
researchers claim that snakes did n’t lose distinct regions , but that instead mammals and birds independently gained them , turning snake evolution on its head			1
scientists have dispelled the theory that hox genes , which establish the boundaries of the neck and trunk , lin birds , lizards , crocodiles and mammals , were disrupted in snakes , resulting in a loss of regions in their seemingly simplified body form as they evolved from four - legged lizard ancestors ( illustrated ) hox genes , which establish the boundaries of the neck , trunk ( body ) , lumbar and tail regions in birds , lizards , crocodiles and mammals , were previously thought to have been disrupted in snakes , resulting in a loss of defined regions , forming their elongated , legless shape			1
to investigate whether the theory was right , @entity48 of @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 of the @entity52 examined regional differences in the shapes of individual vertebral bones in snakes , lizards , alligators and mice			1
snakes are different from other amniote groups – those that descended from four - limbed animals with backbones that lay eggs on land – because they lack forelimbs , shoulder girdles and sternal skeletons			2
until now , it had been assumed that snake vertebrae became less regionalised , or defined , when the limbs were lost			2
by studying the vertebrae of snakes , ( a skeleton is pictured , ) researchers have concluded that the reptiles did n’t lose distinct regions , but that instead mammals and birds independently gained them a snake 's backbone is made up of between 200 and 400 vertebrae attached to ribs , which helps them be so flexible			1
by comparison , humans have 33 vertebrae and 24 ribs			2
the bones and muscle protect the reptile 's internal organs			0
the throat of the snake takes up the front third of the animal 's body , while its stomach can stretch to the size of the animal it is eating			0
the skulls of snakes vary in composition but have numerous joints to allow them to swallow prey far larger than their heads			0
their jaws are not fused together , so when they have a mouthful of food , they can still breathe using a tube at the bottom of their mouth , which can protrude			0
‘ if the evolution of the snake body was driven by simplification or loss of @entity122 genes , we would expect to see fewer regional differences in the shapes of vertebrae , ’ dr @entity51 explained			1
‘ instead , what we found was the exact opposite			0
snakes have the same number of regions and in the same places in the vertebral column as limbed lizards			1
’ the duo discovered that the snakes they studied were as varied as lizards			2
when they compared regions in snakes with @entity122 gene expression - the process by which information from a gene is used to make a protein - they found that the two matched , according to the study in @entity147			2
‘ this suggests that @entity122 genes are functioning in the evolution and development of the vertebral column in snakes - but instead of patterning distinct , rib-less regions like the neck and lumbar spine of mice , they control more subtle , graded changes in shape , ’ the said			1
when the findings were combined with information from fossils , the researchers concluded that the direction of snake evolution is the opposite of what was previously thought based on genetics alone			0
‘ our findings turn the sequence of evolutionary events on its head , dr @entity48 said			0
dr @entity48 said that the study 's findings ' turn the sequence of evolutionary events [ in snakes ] on its head '			0
she observed that snakes have lost the shoulder girdle but as just as regionalised as lizards ‘ it is n’t that snakes have lost regions and @entity122 expression , it is that mammals and birds have independently gained distinct regions by augmenting the ordinary @entity122 expression shared by early amniotes			1
‘ snakes have a lot more vertebrae compared to lizards and they have lost the shoulder girdle , but they are just as regionalised , ’ @entity48 said			1
to come to their conclusion , the researchers used a method called geometric morphometrics , which marks individual points on a plane using a pair of numerical coordinates to analyse the shape and size of vertebral structures			0
they also used a statistical method called ' maximum likelihood estimation ' to work out where one segment ends and the next begins			0
dr @entity51 said : ‘ analysis of gene functions are necessary , but not sufficient in studying evolutionary transitions			0
‘ in order to fully understand the mechanisms by which new body forms evolve , it is crucial to study the anatomy of modern and fossil organisms			0

palaeontologists at @entity49 and @entity52 examined differences in vertebrae in snakes , lizards , alligators and mice
they have shed new light on how snakes evolved their legless bodies
experts claim snakes did n’t lose distinct regions such as their neck , but that instead mammals and birds independently gained them
