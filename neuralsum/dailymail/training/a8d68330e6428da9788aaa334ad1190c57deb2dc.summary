a total of 425 guests donned formal wear and enjoyed drinks and a three - course meal as @entity16 councillor @entity1 became lord mayor of @entity3 , @entity18 , earlier this year - all at the expense of the city 's council			1
the authority , which faces crippling funding cuts , will now look at slashing costs for next year 's event with front - line services said to be under threat			1
the huge bill looks particularly extravagant when compared to similar ceremonies in the @entity31 's other major cities			1
@entity34 council 's annual celebration cost nothing this year , while @entity36 's modest celebration - a lunch for 22 guests - cost just £ 440			2
only two other cities managed to rack up a four - figure tab - but bashes in both @entity41 and @entity42 were still relatively cheap when compared to @entity3 's			1
@entity43 , which announced earlier this month that it faces a £ 110million budget shortfall - £ 40million higher than the £ 70million projected earlier this year , will now look at ways to reduce costs and the number of guests attending next year			2
a committee made up of former lord mayor 's will look at the costs of this year 's dinner and recommend ways in which the council can slash costs in future			1
councillor @entity57 , who was mayor in 2007 , said : ' we are looking at what the cost of the mayor - making is and have broken the £ 27,000 down into a list of expenses			2
' the banquet itself is £ 17,500 and we will be looking to significantly reduce that			0
we will also be looking to substantially reduce the number of people attending			0
' the cost of the celebration was revealed after the @entity73 - run council 's leader sir @entity71 issued a warning that entire services could be cut as the authority desperately looks to cut costs			2
costly : taxpayers shelled out £ 27,000 for this lavish ceremony to welcome new lord mayor @entity1 the cost of the lavish ceremony ' reeks of hypocrisy according to @entity84 , campaign manager of the @entity85			1
he said : ' @entity43 bosses and civic leaders can not maintain the moral authority to make necessary spending cuts if they are hold lavish taxpayer funded banquets			2
' it reeks of hypocrisy to talk of wiping out front line services when you still manage to find money to spend tens of thousands of pounds on a mayor making shindig			0
' preserving tradition is one thing , but this event should be funded by sponsorship rather than the bill being left to hard - pressed @entity3 families			1
' and union chiefs also hit out at spending such a large sum on the lavish banquet given the council 's dire financial situation			1
regional secretary of @entity111 , @entity112 , said : ' the expense can not be justified while services are being cut and people are losing their jobs			0
@entity3 's lavish mayor making ceremony cost £ 27,000			1

mayor may entertain small number of guests at @entity138 at own expense @entity140 £ 600 : church service followed by tea and cakes @entity144 £ 1,000 : finger buffet for 200 guests following annual council meeting ' we are pleased the council is reviewing how much it spends to reflect the current economic climate			0
' @entity43 has reduced its bar bill in recent years - the ceremony had previously included a separate wine reception , entertainment from a string quartet and a bugler to someone guests to dinner			0
since taking over as council leader last may , sir @entity71 has also cancelled the £ 2,000 high tea at the monthly council meetings			0
@entity16 councillor @entity57 pointed out that , although @entity41 spent £ 15,500 , it had 200 guests for a four - course dinner with live entertainment , creating a higher price per head			0
the mayoral committee is looking closely at the authority 's deal with its @entity174 company under which it pays a commercial rate bill for food and room hire			2
earlier this month , @entity43 approved £ 110million cuts to its april budget , with 90 jobs said to be under threat			0
almost £ 4.5million of funding will be cut from voluntary sector organisations which provide home start services and family support			0
