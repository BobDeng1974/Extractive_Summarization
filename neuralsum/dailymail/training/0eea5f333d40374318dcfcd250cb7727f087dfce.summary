@entity4 is trialling reusable electronic bag tags , pictured , that do away with the need for a new sticky label each time you fly			1
the electronic barcode on the tag changes for each journey to show a passenger 's latest flight details a passenger checks in to a flight using the official @entity4 smartphone app. the app is then held over the electronic bag tag and the flight details , destination and personal details of the passenger are sent wirelessly using @entity35 technology			1
@entity35 stands for near - field communication and can transfer data from one device to another simply by touching the devices together			0
a written summary is also shown so passengers can check everything is correct			0
the electronic screens ' fix ' the image onto the tag for the duration of the trip – allowing it to be scanned electronically when going through luggage handling at departure , onto the plane , and through to the luggage collection carousel in the arrivals			2
the details stay on the tag until the customer checks onto a new flight			2
the battery turns off once the image is ' fixed ' so it can be used on long haul flights			0
