by @entity1 reporter published : 10:54 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 11:03 est , 24 july 2013 the @entity2 may have the technology to collect and sift through massive amounts of electronic data produced throughout the world , but claims it is n’t capable of searching emails sent by its own employees			1
in response to a @entity14 request , the spying agency has claimed that it simply does n’t have the correct technology to carry out such a search			1
' there 's no central method to search an email at this time with the way our records are set up , unfortunately , ' @entity18 officer @entity17 told @entity25			1
the @entity2 , barely out of the news thanks to whistle - blower @entity27 , claims that it does n't have the technology capable of searching emails sent by its own employees ‘ the system is ' a little antiquated and archaic , ' she added			1
a journalist for the website received the unexpected response when they approached the organization requesting to see correspondence between @entity2 employees and the @entity40 regarding a documentary which had aired on the tv channel			1
a few days after filing his initial request , @entity17 called and was asked to narrow his request since the @entity14 office can only search emails ' person by person , ' rather than in bulk			1
@entity17 said he was bemused by the organizations response because it is quite common for large corporations to do bulk searches of their employees email as part of internal investigations			2
a new @entity2 data center in @entity61 , @entity59 is set to open in the fall and will be the largest of several interconnected centers spread throughout the country the @entity2 has more than 30,000 employees			1
' it 's just baffling , ' @entity67 of the @entity68 told @entity25			2
' this is an agency that 's charged with monitoring millions of communications globally and they ca n't even track their own internal communications in response to a @entity14 request			1
' on tuesday it was revealed that intelligence sources now believe whistle - blower @entity27 was unable to access the ' crown jewels ' @entity2 programs that secretly monitor telephone and online conversations worldwide			1
after launching a wide reaching internal review demanded by president @entity85 , the @entity2 found that @entity27 failed to see any @entity86 , or ' extremely compartmentalized information ' according to one official familiar with the review			1
the administration has said that it knows the material @entity27 downloaded but sources told @entity92 that this does reduce the seriousness of the former freelance contractors actions			2
making a break for it : @entity27 's lawyer announced that it is in the leaker 's best interest to stay in @entity101 for the time being before heading to a @entity104 country for long - term asylum ' we are not downplaying it , ' said one source to @entity92 about the amount of data stolen by @entity27			2
the official spoke to @entity92 on background because the assessment is not fully completed			0
on monday @entity27 revealed that he expects to be granted papers this week that will allow him to leave the @entity117 airport and legally exit into the @entity101 city			0
the former consultant turned national security leaker has spent a month in the transit area of a @entity117 airport and his @entity101 lawyer announced on monday that they hope it will come to an end very soon			0
@entity127 , who helped the @entity104 file his bid for temporary asylum in @entity101 on july 16 , said @entity27 thinks it is in his best interest to stay in @entity101 for the time being before heading to a @entity104 country for long - term asylum			0
@entity27 reportedly believes it would be unsafe to try to travel to @entity135 soon because of @entity137 efforts to return him to the @entity137 to face espionage charges			0
@entity101 lawyer @entity127 speaks to the media after visiting @entity2 leaker @entity27 at @entity140 outside @entity117 on wednesday ' he should get this certificate ( allowing him to leave the airport ) shortly , ' mr @entity127 said			1
@entity27 's bid for temporary asylum in @entity101 may take up to three months to process , but he can pass through customs based on the initial response to his request , @entity127 added			2
@entity27 has not ruled out seeking @entity101 citizenship , @entity127 said			0
instead he is thought to be focusing his efforts on @entity135 countries like @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 who have all said they would grant him political asylum			0
the problem with those destinations , however , is that none of them are reachable by direct commercial flight from @entity117			0
@entity27 's presence at @entity117 's @entity140 since june 23 has strained @entity137 - @entity101 relations , with president @entity85 publicly and privately calling on prime minister @entity163 to order his extradition to the @entity137			0
causing problems : the battle over @entity27 has increased tensions between president @entity85 and president @entity163 , as the @entity137 wants him back so the government can prosecute but @entity101 refuses the drama between the two world leaders began shortly after it was revealed that @entity27 flew from @entity172 to the @entity101 capitol , with the @entity174 claiming that there was a ' clear legal basis ' to extradite @entity27			2
instead , @entity163 tried to deflect the issue at a press conference during a trip to @entity180 where he said : ' @entity27 is a free person			0
the sooner he chooses his final destination , the better it is for him and @entity101 '			0
president @entity85 has said he wo n't engage in any ' wheeling , dealing and trading ' to get the leaker back on @entity104 soil in order to prosecute him for releasing top secret documents about @entity2 surveillance programs			1
' i 'm not going to be scrambling jets to get to a 29 - year - old hacker , ' president @entity85 said of the whistle blower during his trip to @entity194 , @entity195 .			0

despite having the technology to spy on people around the world , the @entity2 claims it ca n't *adequately* search emails sent by its own workers
the *revelation* follows a request for information under the @entity14
