this was the satellite photo which shamed @entity2 by showing how the people of the hermit kingdom endure inky blackness at night			1
but now the hermit kingdom 's propaganda machine has hit back , proclaiming that the stoic workers of the @entity9 have no need for ' flashy lights '			1
a recent editorial in the @entity13 , @entity2 's tightly leashed newspaper of record , also says the photo represents the future of the @entity16 - ' an old superpower that is meeting its sunset '			1
conspicuous by its absence : @entity2 is clearly visible by its lack of lighting at night - time , in this image of the @entity24 taken from the @entity25 and circulated by @entity26 last year the famous photo , in circulation for more than a year , captures the bright lights of @entity30 and @entity31 , including @entity30 capital @entity33 as the brilliant splash of white and sodium orange close to the border			1
by contrast , @entity2 's city lights are conspicuous by their absence , with the whole country appearing to vanish at night save for a small blob shining from @entity43 , the seat of power			1
the @entity48 's @entity47 blog unearthed @entity13 's reference to the picture , in a 4,000 - word editorial that reporter @entity52 describes as ' a standard hyperbolic @entity2 screed '			2
under the heading ' right in front of our eyes ' - a reference to a quote from @entity59 , of course - the @entity61 exhorts @entity2 's workers to follow the orders of their leaders to build a great and prosperous nation			2
' they [ @entity2 ’s detractors ] clap their hands and get loud over a satellite picture of our city with not much light , but the essence of society is not on flashy lights , ' it declares , according to @entity48 's translation			1
it points out that the @entity16 is beset by problems including massive debts , the @entity81 protests and the uprising of @entity83 following the shooting of @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 , last year			1
those failings , according to the paper , show that ' an old superpower that is meeting its sunset may put up a face of arrogance but it ca n’t avoid its dark fate			0
' bright lights , big city ... youths march in @entity43 to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of @entity2 's ' revolutionary armed forces '			2
@entity43 is the only @entity2 city visible from space at night first published in january last year , the satellite photo snapped from the @entity25 provoked comment on @entity2 's failure to light its territory , compared to its highly developed neighbours			1
a @entity108 spokesman said at the time : ' @entity2 is almost completely dark compared to neighboring @entity30 and @entity31			0
' the darkened land appears as if it were a patch of water joining the @entity113 to the @entity114			0
its capital city , @entity43 , appears like a small island , despite a population of 3.26 million ( as of 2008 )			0
the light emission from @entity43 is equivalent to the smaller towns in @entity30			0
' coastlines are often very apparent in night imagery , as shown by @entity30 ’s eastern shoreline			0
but the coast of @entity2 is difficult to detect			0
' the @entity26 statement went on to point out the difference in per capita power consumption between the two countries , with @entity30 consuming nearly 14 times as much as their cousins north of the @entity130			0
@entity2 leader @entity59 talksto officers during his visit to a dockyard : satellite pictures have also been used to keep track of @entity2 's nuclear weapons programme , which experts fear has restarted satellite pictures have not only been used to point out the lack of development in @entity2			2
last month experts cited newly relesed images to suggest the country may be attempting to restart its main nuclear bomb fuel reactor			0
when fully operational , the five - megawatt facility is reported to be capable of producing about six kilos of plutonium a year - enough for a nuclear bomb			0
@entity2 has conducted three nuclear tests , and recently threatened a fourth amid tensions over fresh @entity16 sanctions and @entity152 moves to censure @entity43 for its human rights record .			1
