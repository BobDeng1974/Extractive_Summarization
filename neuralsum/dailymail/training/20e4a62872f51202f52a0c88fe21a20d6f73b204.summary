it might seem an unusual accomplishment for a banker from the big end of town , but @entity5 is n't concerned with what other people think			1
mr @entity5 , who is a director @entity9 's @entity8 , has just launched his second saucy novel : ' submission : lessons from the desert '			1
' i 'm sure there are colleagues who think it 's foolish , but i say : sex and laughter ? what 's not to like ? ' ' submission ' is the second piece of erotic fiction by former soldier and director of the @entity8 , @entity5 ' submission ' is an erotic thriller set in @entity27 , a fictional middle - eastern country where ' perfection is tangible , women are invisible ' and ' warmth is a drug			1
' according to @entity34 , the ' all - seeing secretary ' to @entity27 's prime minister , and one of the novel 's central characters , it 's a place where people come to make their fortunes			1
' so the expatriate compounds are full of ambitious , oversexed fools , ' she tells the reader			1
@entity5 says the title does make people wonder			1
' you ca n't write any good story about adults without sex and certainly , there are a few scenes in the book that are a bit confronting , ' he told @entity52			1
@entity5 graduates from the @entity54 's @entity53 in 1967 in @entity55 , @entity5 draws on his pre-corporate life as a @entity58 officer in the @entity59 to tell the story of three ex-pats ; their ' spiritual awakenings ' and their passions in @entity64			1
there 's @entity66 , a @entity67 lawyer and @entity69 veteran who has been sent by his firm to advise @entity72 's prime minister - though he 's not quite sure why			1
there 's @entity74 , a ' sincere ' @entity75 with an absent banker husband and there 's @entity34 , the gorgeous secretary and a former high - end - call girl who takes a fancy to @entity66			1
' it 's an action movie in prose , ' says @entity5			1
' it presents as a literary thriller , spy stuff , and gradually turns into a love story with a fair amount of self awareness for @entity66 and a degree of spiritual awakening for the two women , ' he tells @entity52			1
@entity5 says his early experiences in the army helped him build @entity66 's character in the novel			1
' it 's in the way he sees the world , his attitude to violence and the way you always know where you stand with him , ' he says			1
' i think anyone who 's served in the @entity59 will get some good laughs from the book			1
' early days : @entity5 , pictured right , in his @entity58 green beret in @entity110 @entity5 says the setting for @entity55 was inspired by six months he spent living in @entity112 , where he was sent by international firm @entity113 in 1991			1
he spent a lot of time in a hotel room with not enough to do			1
' it was the kind of place where you heard the first half of a joke at someone 's lunch and you 'd hear the punchline at someone else 's dinner , ' said @entity5			1
' i realised very quickly that i could either become an alcoholic or try writing			2
' in fact , @entity5 began writing much earlier , beginning his professional life as a journalist with a four - month gig at the @entity132			1
he says he soon decided he did n't want to write about what other people do , but felt he did n't have any stories of his own to tell			2
' i stopped writing for 18 years then finally thought , maybe i 'd had enough life experience now			2
' i always wanted to write but did n't think i had a story to tell : the @entity138 and former @entity59 officer , pictured here in 1970 in @entity141 , actually began his career as a journalist in @entity144 so how does @entity5 find the time to write around his demanding responsibilities with one of @entity9 's biggest banks ? ' we always find time for the things we love , ' he says			1
the other thing @entity5 loves , and something he 's famous for , is giving ' brilliant , animated dinner parties			1
' ' i always try to have a mixture of people - you do n't want big bankers sitting around a table talking to themselves , that would just be boring - you want artists , academics , journalists , a diversity of people			1
' certainly , @entity5 's own story has been a diverse one			1
do his dinner guests enjoy his books ? ' well they say they do ! ' submission : lessons from the desert by @entity5 is available through @entity174			1
@entity5 's first erotic novel , ' partners : love is a law unto itself ' was called the business world ’s equivalent of @entity181 ’ hit novel @entity182			1
dr. @entity184 allowed another silence to grow between them			2
@entity74 forced herself not to fidget , but she found it impossible to hold his gaze			2
“ miss @entity190 , you are direct , so i will be direct			2
i would like you to take off your clothes			2
“ for money ? ” she did n’t know what had made her say that			2
i judge that you have never done it before , for a man			2
” @entity74 stood up and began			2
“ you are charmingly awkward , ” he said			2
“ it is better to start with your shoes , and sitting down			2
but never mind , you are doing fine			2
hang your dress in the closet			0
put everything in there and close the door			0
” “ now what ? ” “ sit back down			0
no , over there on the couch			0
you are extremely pleasant to look at			0
“ change your position from time to time , so that i may appreciate all of you			0
do you run ? ” “ every morning			0
” @entity74 ’s throat was dry and her voice cracked a little			0
“ would you like a glass of water ? ” “ yes , please			0
” @entity74 started to rise			0
“ no , do n’t move			0
i am happy to wait on you			0
” he went in to his kitchen and returned with an expensive looking tumbler of ice water			0
he set it on the table beside her and she drank			1
he returned to his chair			0
“ better ? ” “ yes			0
” “ you have a dignity about you that i like			0
” “ it is surprising , ” said @entity74 , “ but i am not at all ashamed			0
” “ there is no reason to be			0
” “ my pulse is racing , though			0
” “ of course it is			0
” “ i wish it would calm down			0
” “ that is quite unnecessary			0
the point is to give me aesthetic pleasure – for you are a lovely woman – and to give yourself an interesting experience			0
” “ i am not sure i ’d call myself a woman			0
” “ you are on the verge of womanhood			0
” for the first time , she laughed			0
“ if you ever are ashamed , there is pleasure to be taken in that too , you know ? ”			0
