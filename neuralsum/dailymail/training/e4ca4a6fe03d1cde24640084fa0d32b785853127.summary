‘ he 's the best scaffolder we ’ve got ’ , declares the company boss as his star employee lifts the @entity2			1
‘ @entity7 and strong , good pair of hands , reliable , ’ the gaffer continues			2
‘ do n’t drop it , ’ hollers one colleague			2
@entity12 is stood on top of the scaffolding he has just assembled in double - quick time			1
in his grasp is the iconic cup , glistening amid the gloom of a murky morning on @entity19			2
@entity20 goalkeeper and scaffolder @entity12 holds the @entity2 at work @entity12 is clad in a navy boilersuit , luminous jacket and safety harness complete with the tools of his trade			1
on friday night , however , he will be wearing nothing more than a goalkeeper ’s kit and a pair of gloves			2
he will be at @entity35 ’s @entity34 , just a few miles from his place of work and a goal - kick away from where he grew up and now lives			1
but @entity12 – a former season - ticket holder at @entity41 – will not be turning out for his hometown club			1
instead , in front of live television cameras and playing at a ‘ proper ’ ground for the first time , he will be representing the green and white of one of the competition ’s most celebrated minnows			1
@entity20 , the @entity50 club , made it to the fifth round in 1978 – losing 2 - 1 in a replay to @entity54 in front of 42,000 at @entity56 - and were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity57 in the third round in 2009			1
the 28 - year - old will be in goal for @entity20 against his hometown team , @entity35 , in the @entity2 that same year , @entity12 was part of the @entity64 pub team which triumphed in the @entity65 against @entity67 wanderers - victory in the second round of the @entity2 on friday evening and the likes of @entity70 and @entity72 lie in wait			1
‘ it ’s mad , ’ the 28 - year - old tells @entity75 as we sit in the boardroom of his firm ’s headquarters and he stares at the @entity2 resting next to us			1
i know that gets said a lot , but the early rounds is where the magic of the cup is now			2
this is what it ’s all about			2
‘ i was playing on a sunday morning not so long ago			1
now i ’m on telly at a proper ground , at the place i went with my dad and two brothers as a kid and with all my family and friends from @entity35 in the @entity20 end - although i had to convince my dad to go in ! ‘ we really think we ’ve got a chance to win as well			1
@entity35 are struggling , they ’re bottom of @entity102			1
we ’ve been flying in the cup , we love it			2
from that very first match this is what you dream about			2
@entity12 ( centre ) holding the famous old trophy at work with his brother @entity111 ( right ) and @entity112 ‘ the @entity2 history of the club is the first thing they tell you about when you sign			1
it ’s massive , they get about £ 70,000 with this being on tv and that could help us with promotion in the long run ’			2
@entity129 , like the majority of the other 232 non-league sides who took part in first round qualifying in september , would have been watching this weekend ’s ties on the tv had it not been for @entity12			1
they were goalless away at @entity133 when the hosts and strong favourites were awarded a second - half penalty			2
@entity12 recalls : ‘ myself and the goalkeeping coach , @entity137 , had looked the night before at where their lad put his penalties			1
‘ it was a one - off special game so we did the research			2
he either goes top left or top right			2
i decided to dive as far as i could to my left and somehow saved it			0
i have no idea how i did			0
i just threw everything i could that way and ended up saving it with my right hand , tipping it on to the post - we might not have been here without that save			0
’ @entity12 ( left ) with his brother @entity111 , holding a trophy he won with the @entity64 pub team in 2009 that same year , @entity129 played @entity158 side @entity57 in the @entity2 third round @entity2 second round kick - off : 7.55pm , @entity34			1
tv : live on @entity162 from 7.30			0
@entity129 won 3 - 0 in the replay before negotiating away ties at @entity167 ( 4 - 1 ) , @entity168 ( 2 - 1 ) and @entity169 ( 4 - 3 )			0
they then hammered @entity172 side @entity171 4 - 1 in the first round proper			0
@entity12 was in the living - room with his wife , @entity175 , and children @entity177 , six , and @entity178 , three , when @entity35 emerged from the hat in the second round draw			1
‘ when @entity35 came out there were still 20 - odd balls left in , ’ he says			1
‘ then it was number 39			0
i just thought , “ wow , that ’s us ”			0
i started jumping all over the living - room , my family did n’t know what was going on			0
my daughter was a bit scared i think			0
’ he adds : ‘ to go back to @entity41 will be special			0
i was going during their best - ever period – the @entity196 play - off final in 2005 and @entity194 away in the @entity2 when we took nearly 10,000			1
i went all over the country with them			0
the play - off final in @entity200 was probably my best day as a fan , even though we got beat			0
’ all the while , football - mad @entity12 was a striker			1
@entity12 talks to @entity75 's @entity204 in the boardroom of the scaffolding company ‘ i was n’t a goalkeeper until i was 19 , i was a centre forward , or at least i told myself that , ’ he reveals			1
‘ one sunday morning i got put in goal when we were short			0
everyone started telling me that i was n’t bad			0
people started to come to watch me			0
‘ i actually wanted to play in goal when i was about eight , but my dad said no. i often tell him that if i ’d started earlier as a keeper i might have made it much higher in the game			0
’ a move to @entity35 and then @entity219 followed before @entity129 paid @entity220 £ 3,000 for @entity12 in the summer			1
he is already a crowd favourite at @entity221			0
juggling a young family , work and his football , however , can prove even more difficult than keeping out penalties			0
@entity226 and @entity12 pose with the @entity2 ahead of the @entity35 clash on friday night ‘ we train twice a week and it ’s an hour and 10 minutes up to @entity129 , ’ he explains			1
‘ i work from 8am to half four , so it ’s quite a gruelling schedule			0
i get in , get my stuff and head straight out			0
‘ scaffolding is hard graft as well , very hard			0
i ’m not a desk , i ’m constantly climbing and lifting			0
i have broken my fingers quite a times			0
you do feel it and it takes your back and arms a while to adjust			0
but it keeps me fit and strong and it helps with my goalkeeping i suppose – i ’m using my hands all the time anyway ! ’ on friday , at least , @entity12 has been afforded some time off			1
the star scaffolder has a bigger job on his hands across town .			2

@entity12 will line up for @entity20 against @entity35

he was born near their @entity34 ground and still lives close by
