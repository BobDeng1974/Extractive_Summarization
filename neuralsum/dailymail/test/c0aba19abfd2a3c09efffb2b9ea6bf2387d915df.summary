@entity0 knows only too well that a @entity1 can make or break a manager			1
his first in the dugout was as assistant to @entity6 in august , 1999 , when on a sodden night at @entity7 the @entity8 left out @entity9 and @entity10 and paid for his selection with his job after a 2 - 1 defeat			1
@entity0 is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory – or a loss – could have on sunday afternoon			1
@entity0 is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against @entity23 on sunday @entity6 controversially decided not to start star players @entity10 and @entity9 in 1999 @entity0 was assistant to former @entity25 manager @entity6 who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 his memories of @entity6 's downfall remind him of such consequences			1
' we were at the old training ground at @entity32 and i was in the room with @entity35 and @entity6 , ' recalls @entity0			1
' all of a sudden , he started talking about what the team was going to be against @entity23			2
i said , ' @entity6 , what did you say there ? '			2
' he said he was going to leave out @entity9 and @entity10			1
i said , ' do you know how important this game is ? '			0
' he said , ' i have played in some massive derbies			0
i 've played in them in @entity45 and @entity46 and i played in the @entity48 derby too '			0
' i said , ' yeah , but you have n't played in one like this @entity6 '			2
' and then we just walked out of the room			0
he seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do			0
' i talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing @entity9 on the bench			2
but he had no concerns whatsoever			0
' i actually thought , ' if we do n't win it , he 's gone '			2
i said to @entity35 , ' is he writing his resignation before the game ? '			0
gullit 's selection gambit did not pay off and @entity25 ended up losing 2 - 1 to @entity23 at @entity7 ' we actually went 1 - 0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened			1
it was a dreadful night			0
' the following morning @entity9 went to see @entity6 , only @entity10 had beaten him to it , knocking the door off the hinges , legend has it			1
by the end of the week he had quit			0
@entity0 was also by @entity77 's side during the last four derby defeats , a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the @entity25			1
in that respect , @entity0 knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis			2
' in the eyes of the fans , if you win a derby game , it 's massive , ' he said			0
' i 'm not saying everything else is forgotten , but it certainly helps your case			0
if i come off and it 's not been a football match but we win 1 - 0 , i 'll be delighted with that			1
' we had a good football match last weekend ( 2 - 1 defeat at home to @entity103 ) and got nothing for it			1
at the end of the day , it 's all about getting the win			0
' @entity0 was also assistant manager to @entity77 , who lost four successive games against @entity23			1
