by @entity0 tiny bats in @entity3 and @entity5 use rolled - up leaves as ear trumpets to improve their hearing			1
other than its use by humans , this is the first time this crafty technique has been seen in nature			0
the behaviour was observed in a species known as the @entity17 's disc - winged bats - distinguished by suction cups on their thumbs and hind feet			1
tiny bats in @entity3 and @entity5 use rolled - up leaves as ear trumpets to improve their hearing			1
other than its use by humans , this is the first time this crafty technique has been seen in nature these tiny bats can often be found nestled inside tapered , unfurling leaves of plants such as @entity29 or @entity30 in groups of about five or six			1
leaves of these plants only remain curled for around a day before they open up and the bats have to find a new home			2
to find where a group has moved to , @entity17 's disc - winged bats have a special social call			1
bats on the outside of the leaves send an enquiry , while their friends send a response signal			2
the behaviour was observed in a species known as the @entity17 's disc - winged bats - distinguished by suction cups on their thumbs and hind feet @entity17 's disc - winged bats are distinguished by suction cups on their thumbs and hind feet which allow them to cling to smooth @entity52 can be found in @entity5 , and in countries including @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
they can often be found nestled inside tapered , unfurling leaves of plants such as @entity29 or @entity30			1
leaves of these plants only remain curled for 24 hours before they open and the bats have to find a new home			2
while studying these bats , biologists @entity63 and @entity64 from the @entity65 in @entity66 found that individuals inside the leaves were often unable to recognise calls made from their friends on the outside			2
they recreated the tapered leaf environment in a lab and found that the call emitted by flying bats was amplified to those inside the furled leaf			0
according to the researchers , the calls from outside the roost were amplified by as much as 10 decimals as sound waves were compressed down the tapered tubes - the same way an ear trumpet amplifies sound			0
but although flying bats almost always recognise their group members ' response calls , bats inside a leaf seemed unable to tell the difference between the inquiry calls of friends and strangers			0
@entity63 claims this is because , as well as amplifying the sound , the leaf distorts incoming calls			0
she added that bats inside the leaves are likely to respond indiscriminately			0
the reason why bats can still find their group , claim scientists , is because the ‘ response call ’ is more complex and easier to identify , even if the quality of the sound is reduced by the leaves			1
the researchers now hope to study how characteristics of the leaf , such as length , width and plant species , affects sound transmission , and how bats may choose their roost because of this			0
according to the researchers , the calls from outside the roost were amplified by as much as 10 decimals as sound waves were compressed down the tapered tubes - the same way an ear trumpet amplifies sound			0

@entity17 's disc - winged bats roost inside leaves of plants such as @entity29
*due* to their shape , these leaves can amplify sounds by up 10 *decibels*
the leaves , however , also cause *messages* to become *muffled* which may have caused the bats to *develop* a more complex response call
