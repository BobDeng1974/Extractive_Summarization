when @entity1 face @entity2 on sunday we ’ll see a team yet to live up to great expectations against one trying to impress a manager with great expectations and little human touch ( @entity2 )			1
i can only speak for myself but i expected a lot more from @entity10 as an @entity12 boss			1
i ’m sure that due to the injuries i had during his time , he ’d probably say the same about me ! but given his track record i expected more ideas and creativity			2
what we got was a prison camp mentality that stifled the life out of us			2
his attitude was , ‘ i ’m the boss and you ’ll do what i say ’ , all day , every day			2
other managers i ’ve worked under , including the best ever , sir @entity28 , know that ’s the way to behave in training and on match - day , but there ’s a time and place when you can be accessible and open			0
with @entity10 it seemed there would never be warmth			1
you get picked off like that when you need flexibility			0
i fear @entity2 will suffer if he ’s taking the same approach			0
@entity1 , on the other hand , are brimming with excitement and have potential if they can gel at this level			1
they showed fight and determination to come from behind in their opener			0
and they have talent , @entity55 especially , but @entity50 has been disappointing and my concern is they ’ll be less than the sum of their parts			1
to celebrate the @entity52 , i 've added a special @entity82 to my fashion range , incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and and with a share of the proceeds going to charity			0
you can find them via www.5mag.co and you can follow me on @entity91 for a chance to win exclusive prizes @ rioferdy5			0

@entity10 was a disappointment as @entity12 manager and lacked creativity
@entity1 have talented *players* but may fail to live up to expectations
@entity55 is a real star but @entity50 has been disappointed
