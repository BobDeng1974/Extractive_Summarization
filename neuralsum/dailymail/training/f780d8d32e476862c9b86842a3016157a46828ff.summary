by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 21 october 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 22 october 2012 the @entity2 ’s director - general was under intense pressure last night as he prepared to face @entity4 with the revelations from tonight ’s devastating @entity7 documentary into the @entity9 scandal ringing in his ears			1
recently - appointed chief @entity11 is understood to have taken legal advice ahead of answering questions from the @entity14 tomorrow			1
mr @entity11 , who was director of @entity15 in 2011 , will be asked why he did nothing last december when he was informed by director of news @entity17 that an impending @entity20 investigation into @entity21 might mean he would have to change his @entity23 broadcast schedule , which contained a tribute to the late television personality			1
probe : the new director general @entity11 is facing a grilling over the @entity2 handling of the @entity29 sex abuse scandal mr @entity11 was appointed director - general earlier this year , succeeding @entity31			1
a popular figure and former editor of @entity20 , he vowed to put ‘ quality ’ back at the heart of the @entity2			0
but his critics argue that he has simply failed to grasp the enormity of the unfolding @entity21 scandal on three separate occasions			2
the first was when he was briefed by @entity41 in december 2011 ; the second was when the decision to shelve the @entity9 film was publicised in january this year ; and the third and final occasion was when the full horror of @entity29 ’s crimes became clear at the start of this month			0
silent : @entity17 was aware of the outline of the shelved @entity20 investigation but has made no comment since the scandal erupted mps will grill him about how he responded to the scandal after it emerged that @entity58 planned to run its own programme dealing with the @entity9 claims			0
@entity7 claims that mr @entity11 was misleading in his accounts of exactly why the @entity21 film was pulled from the @entity20 schedules last year			1
mr @entity11 has said publicly that the reason it was shelved was because the original programme was not an investigation purely into @entity29 ’s abuse , but into a failed previous inquiry into @entity21 by @entity70 police			1
in an email to staff on october 5 , mr @entity11 suggested as much by saying : ‘ the @entity20 programme investigated @entity70 police ’s inquiry into @entity29 towards the end of 2011			1
’ similarly , the line consistently given by the @entity2 has been that the reason the programme was dropped was because of a ‘ lack of evidence ’ to confirm the specific allegation that @entity70 police and the @entity83 had scrapped the investigation because of @entity29 ’s age and health			2
contradiction : @entity20 producer @entity88 gave a different account about the @entity9 report was spiked but two @entity20 staff members who worked on the investigation have now told @entity7 that this suggested the programme was about the police inquiry and not about @entity29 ’s misdeeds			1
indeed , within hours of mr @entity11 ’s october 5 email , producer @entity88 had responded to contradict his account			2
he wrote : ‘ @entity99 – one note – the investigation was into whether @entity29 was a paedophile – i know because it was my investigation			0
‘ we did n’t know that @entity70 police had investigated @entity29 – no one did – that was what we found when we investigated and interviewed his victims			0
’ and the reporter who worked with mr @entity88 , @entity109 , tells @entity7 : ‘ the story we were investigating was very clear cut			2
‘ it was about @entity29 being a paedophile and using his status as a charity fundraiser and television presenter to get access to places where there were vulnerable teenage girls he could abuse			0
’ tonight ’s film will also increase the pressure on @entity41 , who was aware of the outline of the @entity20 investigation but has made no comment since the scandal erupted			0
more than 200 people have come forward to say they were abused by the tv star @entity7 reveals that she had a ‘ conversation of less than ten seconds ’ with mr @entity11 about the film at an awards ceremony at a @entity135 in @entity136 on december 2 last year , telling him about the risk to a @entity23 television schedule which contained a tribute to @entity21			1
in addition , @entity20 editor @entity137 , who dramatically quit last night over the affair , has always maintained that he was not put under any pressure to shelve the story			0
but the documentary will hear bombshell claims from miss @entity109 that mr @entity137 was feeling under pressure from his bosses to drop the investigation in november last year			0
questions : director general @entity11 , left , faces a panel of mps over the corporation 's handling of the scandal which caused @entity20 editor @entity137 , right , to step down from his role @entity7 reveals that on november 30 , 2011 – after a string of rows with mr @entity137 – miss @entity109 wrote to a friend : ‘ @entity158 [ @entity137 ] says if the bosses are n’t happy ... [ he ] ca n’t go to the wall on this one			1
’ the @entity20 journalists also take issue with another public statement made by their editor			0
in defending his decision to drop the story , on october 2 , 2012 , mr @entity137 wrote in his @entity2 blog : ‘ we are confident that all the women we spoke to had contacted the police already			2
’ but mr @entity88 tells @entity7 : ‘ the key witness @entity170 categorically told us she had not gone to the police and @entity137 was reminded many times that this was the case both verbally and in writing			0

*explosive* @entity7 report claims director - general @entity11 gave misleading accounts about why @entity29 expose was pulled
mr @entity11 ' seeks legal advice ' before facing @entity180
critics accuse @entity2 chief of failing to grasp enormity of the scandal
