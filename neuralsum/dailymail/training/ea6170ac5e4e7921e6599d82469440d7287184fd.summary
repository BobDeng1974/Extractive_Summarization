by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 believes his young side are ready to deliver at last - but he would still take a 1 - 0 victory in the tiny football outpost of @entity7 on tuesday night			1
the rise of @entity10 superstar @entity9 and @entity12 playmaker @entity11 , not to mention a healthy sprinkling of solid @entity15 performers , has taken expectation levels in @entity3 to new heights as @entity2 's squad start out on the road to @entity20			1
wales have not qualified for a major tournament since the 1958 @entity24 finals and the current side , dubbed the ' @entity26 ' by some , have had their fair share of setbacks during their development			1
but @entity2 feels he has the talent at his disposal to challenge group favourites @entity34 and @entity35 for the automatic two qualifying spots , let alone make the play - offs by finishing third in a section which also includes @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity7			2
ready to impress : @entity9 ( third from right ) spearheads @entity3 against @entity7 on tuesday optimistic and realistic : coach @entity2 is confident his side will impress , but will take a 1 - 0 result ' there 's a reason why people talk so highly of the group because it 's true that when we 're at our best we are a good side , ' @entity2 said ahead of @entity3 ' first @entity52 test high in the @entity53			1
' i sense the expectation and two years ago i would have been wary of it			2
i 'm not now and i wo n't shy away from it			0
' we have to take it as a compliment and deal with it , and if we do that we 'll do the business			0
' @entity34 and @entity35 are the top teams and then it 's the other four , but we have a chance to put pressure on those two			0
' i do n't want to go at it thinking there 's a possibility of a play - off			2
let 's go for the top two , that 's what we have to aim for			0
' front man : @entity9 is tipped to start at centre - forward for his country rather than his customary wide left position @entity7 are ranked 199 in the world and their statistics do not make impressive reading : they have won only one competitive game since their introduction to world football in 1998 , not collected a single point in @entity84 qualifying and not managed a competitive goal for four years			1
but on the plus side they tend not to suffer heavy defeats and the @entity88 struggled to a 2 - 0 victory in @entity7 during 2014 world cup qualifying			1
' we 're not going to into the game thinking about we 're going to win it this way , we just want the win and i 'd take 1 - 0 , ' @entity2 said			1
' as good as we can be , we 've also shown tendencies where we can be a little bit loose and a bit carried away			0
we ca n't have that			0
' the build - up to the qualifier has been dominated by the controversial surface at the newly - built @entity103 in @entity104			2
the stadium 's artificial 3g surface was only passed fit for use by @entity108 last wednesday after original tests showed the ball was rolling too fast on the pitch			0
star men : @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity12 's @entity11 will attract attention among a host of youngsters but @entity2 will not be blaming the pitch should things go dramatically wrong on the night and @entity3 suffer one of the biggest embarrassments in world football			1
' whatever happens on tuesday night i wo n't mention the pitch , ' @entity2 said			1
' i 'm not interested in it and we have n't talked about it			0
' i 'm sure @entity7 will have trained on it many times but this is the first game on it			2
' we 'll just be walking through things on it ( in training ) and getting the journey out of our legs			0
' all i 'm interested in is getting home on wednesday morning with the points in the bag and a platform and we can take it from there			0

wales play @entity7 in opening @entity20 qualifier on tuesday night
@entity2 's @entity3 side will include @entity9 and @entity11
expectation are high for @entity3 , who have n't *appeared* at a major tournament since the 1958 @entity24
nevertheless , @entity2 says he would take a 1 - 0 win against the *minnows*
@entity7 are ranked 199 in the world and won one competitive game
