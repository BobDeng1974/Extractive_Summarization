it was a project almost 12 months in the making - a 72 - foot wooden sculpture of two people lovingly looking into each other , built across studios in @entity5 and @entity6			1
called embrace , the plywood installation was supposed to be a place to reflect and contemplate life and love			1
and , like countless other pieces of art to feature at @entity15 , it was reduced to nothing but dust and ash on thursday night			2
the remote week - long rave in the @entity20 desert - often described as ' where @entity22 meets @entity24 ' - culminates each year with many of the statement artworks going up in flames , in a symbol of catharsis , reflection and new beginnings			1
' in short , embrace is about asking people to consider why death is so challenging and why it ’s also so beautiful , ' lead artist @entity35 said			1
tragically death was an all - too - real element of this year 's festival			1
the bus was transporting passengers around the festival when the accident happened a little after midnight			2
it is not known whether the @entity77 woman was walking at the time or whether she fell off and then underneath the bus , which had people dancing on the top deck at the time of the accident			2
later in the day , thousands of the almost 70,000 - strong crowd gathered at @entity85 to watch as the first of this year 's sculptures was burned , taking a moment to remember @entity68			1
@entity89 said the design of the piece was supposed to be hopeful			0
' it ’s not all about sorrow			0
it ’s also about appreciating the relationships in your life , ' he said			2
' i want people to think about people they miss. but i do n’t want people to miss out on those moments you share with the ones who are still here			0
say “ i love you			2
” ' enjoy that moment now			0
' this year 's festival has already been dogged by moments of controversy			0
@entity111 was doused in rain in the lead up to the gate 's opening on august 25 , forcing organizers to turn people away until the grounds had dried and the proper festival infrastructure could be put back together			0
next , hardcore ' burners ' complained the essence of what the festival represented - a society without currency built on sharing and freedom - had been ruined by an influx of tech billionaires that brought with them a five star experience , complete with luxury rv 's , top shelf liquor and even bodyguards			0

they built a wooden figure and lit it at the end of a ceremony			0
the ritual moved to the @entity111 in 1990 after park police would n't allow the fire and it grew into a combination campout , performance venue , artist haven and experiment in communal living and greatly expanded during that decade			0
it 's now a nonprofit organization committed to leaving no trace of its participants in between each year 's event			0
because the event is far from cities of any size — the nearest town 16 miles away is @entity182 , @entity20 , population 200 , but about 90 minutes away because of the roads — medical care beyond what volunteer doctors and health - care workers provide can be tough to get quickly			1
