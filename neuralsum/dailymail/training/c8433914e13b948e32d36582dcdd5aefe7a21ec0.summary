passengers on an aircraft flying out of @entity2 had to deal with the scariest of sights just after take off			2
the cabin of a @entity6 plane began to fill with smoke as the aircraft began its climb on one of the hottest days of the year			1
soon afterwards , the plane began to shake violently as it encountered turbulence			0
passengers were told to stay in their seats , but it did n't stop some travelers from taking pictures of the troubling sight			0
glow sticks required : @entity18 began to fill the cabin of this @entity6 plane and it did n't dissipate until the aircraft had reached cruising altitude one @entity22 user @entity21 posted the picture stating : ' last night flying out of @entity2 ...			1
this happened and freaked us out			0
disco rave flight ! ' the fog in the cabin began to appear whilst the aircraft was on the ground and remained until the plane had reached cruising altitude			1
once the plane hit rough air on an otherwise clear summers evening , the worry that some passengers felt can be seen from the picture @entity21 snapped			2
feeling their concern , the captain decided to offer the entire planeload of passengers free alcoholic drinks			2
the airline normally charges up to $ 7 for such luxuries			0
' i was grateful for my tiny bottles of vodka and juice			0
worst turbulence ever after such a long @entity51 stay and fogging , ' @entity21 wrote			0
smoke on a plane : the fog seemed to form on takeoff from @entity2 on one of the hottest days of the year although the fog in the cabin appeared to rise up to the chest level of many passengers , it became apparent that it was due to the hot 90 degree weather @entity65 has been experiencing , coupled with an air conditioning system malfunction			1
however , basic science is able to explain the appearance of the fog in the cabin : hot humid air outside mixing with cool conditioned air from inside the plane , and the mist begins to form			1
as the plane takes off , the air pressure in the cabin decreases			2
the temperature of the air also decreases and if it is rapid enough the air will cool enough for the water in the air to condense instantaneously , forming the fog that the passengers witnessed			1
nothing dangerous , but still unnerving when flying at 35,000 ft.			0
