at least two burglars broke into a house in @entity2 , @entity3 , on saturday and headed straight for the gun safe			1
the thieves struck just three weeks after the address and home owner 's name , registered to a legal firearms permit , was published on the controversial gun map published by the @entity11			1
the burglars could n't open the safe and the owner was n't at home			2
but this incident has led to speculation that the map is now being used by criminals for targeted gun theft			2
this home in @entity2 , @entity3 , is also listed on the controversial gun map and was broken into on saturday the thieves broke into the property at 9.30pm on saturday , using a ladder to enter through a second story window			1
according to @entity28 , the burglars then headed for the safe where the homeowner , a man in his 70s , stores his legally owned guns			1
the intruders abandoned their attempts when they could n't crack the safe , and police say that one suspect has been taken into custody			2
the home owner declined to comment while police continue their investigations but a @entity3 state senator has again blasted the gun map after this incident			1
' no comment ' : the @entity2 homeowner told @entity47 he had nothing to add while police continued investigations into the burglary ' @entity53 's shopping list ? ' both homes are featured on the map that lists the names and addresses of legal gun owners @entity59 senator @entity59 has proposed legislation that restricts gun permit information to law enforcement authorities and he strongly criticized the @entity11			1
' it is reported that the burglar used the @entity11 ’ interactive gun map to target a home included on the map , ' @entity59 said in statement			1
' @entity11 has placed the lives of these folks at risk by creating a virtual shopping list for criminals and nut jobs			1
' if the connection is proven , this is further proof that these maps are not only an invasion of privacy but that they present a clear and present danger to law - abiding , private citizens			0
' former convicts have already testified to the usefulness of the asinine @entity11 ‘ gun maps ’ yet the reckless editors are evidently willing to roll the dice , gambling with the lives of innocent local homeowners , ' the senator continued			1
' reckless ' : a @entity90 blasted the @entity11 for their controversial gun map the @entity93 newspaper reportedly hired a team of armed guards to patrol the paper 's headquarters in @entity98 after publishing the names and addresses of nearby gun permit owners			1
the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban @entity106 and @entity107 counties just north of @entity108 in an interactive map			1
the @entity110 reported that @entity11 editor @entity111 hired gun - toting security guards to guard the paper 's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days			2
along with an article entitled ' the gun owner next door : what you do n't know about the weapons in your neighborhood , ' the @entity11 map was compiled in response to the december 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in @entity130 , @entity131 , editors of the @entity134 - owned newspaper said			1
the publication prompted outrage , particularly on social media sites , among gun owners			0
' do you fools realize that you also made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns in them to protect themselves ? ' @entity146 of @entity147 , @entity148 , posted on the newspaper 's web site			2
' what a bunch of liberal boobs you all are			0
' calling for change : the paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the @entity130 shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood , and there were protests across the country ( pictured )			2
the newspaper 's editor and vice president of news , @entity168 , defended the decision to list the permit holders			0
' we knew publication of the database would be controversial , but we felt sharing as much information as we could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of the @entity130 shootings , ' she said			0
some critics retaliated by posting reporters ' and editors ' addresses and other personal information online			0
@entity184 , a journalism professor at the @entity185 at @entity186 , called the critics ' response childish and petulant			0
on the list : as well as @entity11 the website @entity191 published a 446 - page list of licensed gun owners in @entity108 ' it does n't move the issue of gun control to the level of intelligent public discussion , ' he said			1
' instead , it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting			0
' @entity184 said the information about permit holders was public and , if presented in context , served a legitimate interest			0
but media critic @entity209 of the @entity211 - based @entity210 wrote online this week that the newspaper 's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit holders ' loss of privacy			0
' if journalists could show flaws in the gun permitting system , that would be newsworthy , ' he said			0
' or , for example , if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political connections , then journalists could better justify the privacy invasion			0
' @entity209 said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears			0
' the net effect of the abuse of public records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening records , which would be the biggest mistake of all , ' he said .			0
