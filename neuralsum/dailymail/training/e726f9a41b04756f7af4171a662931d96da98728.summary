getting your dog spayed or neutered is accepted as being part of a responsible pet owner			1
but two studies suggest that the surgical procedure could increase the long - term risk of certain cancers in canines			1
a study conducted in 2013 found a link between neutering in @entity11 and incidences of cancers including osteosarcoma , mast cell cancer and hemangiosarcoma			1
two studies suggest that spaying or neutering pets could increase the long - term risk of certain cancers			1
a study conducted in 2013 found a link between the practice in @entity11 ( stock image pictured ) and incidences of osteosarcoma - a rare bone cancer - mast cell cancer and hemangiosarcoma researchers from the @entity27 studied hospital records of 759 dogs between the age of one and eight years old			1
they found that three times as many early neutered males were diagnosed with lymphosarcoma – the third most common cancer in dogs – as unneutered males			1
and the percentage of late - neutered females , at eight per cent , was four times more than intact and early - neutered females			0
another study , published in 2014 , focused on connections seen in the @entity44 breed and was based on a voluntary internet study for 2,505 dogs born between 1992 and 2008 , @entity40 reported			1
scientists from @entity48 , @entity49 , found correlations between spayed and neutered @entity51 and mast cell cancer , lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma			1
a stock image of lymphoma in human blood is pictured scientists from @entity48 , @entity49 , found correlations between spayed and neutered @entity51 and mast cell cancer , lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma - cancer of blood vessel lining			1
neutered @entity44 ( stock image ) were also found to be more likely to develop behaviour disorders dogs that had undergone the procedure were also more likely to have behaviour disorders , such as storm anxiety and the younger they were spayed or neutered , the earlier these problems may show , according to the study , which was published in the @entity70 's journal			1
however the researchers said that more research is needed to confirm their findings			1
commenting on the study in a blog post , dr @entity76 , of @entity77 , in @entity78 , @entity79 , wrote : ' of course the benefits of spay and neuter , such as controlling dog and cat populations and the many other medical benefits currently outweigh the adverse effects			2
‘ but this study shows that we need to maintain a healthy level of surveillance of the potential adverse effects of gonadectomy and attempt to determine : is this association between cancer and spay / neuter true for all breeds , even mixed breeds , and what is the pathophysiology behind it			2
’ @entity100 , veterinary surgeon at @entity102 , told @entity103 : ' our main reason for neutering is to prevent the dogs from being used for breeding			0
one medical benefit of neutering is the prevention of prolonged seasons leading to potential womb infection in older age			0
' there are lots of reasons to support neutering , but it ’s impossible to say for sure whether neutering or not neutering your dog causes cancer			0
while the results of the two studies may sound bleak , @entity121 , a phd student at the @entity122 , noted that the @entity11 studied in the 2013 paper were referred to an expensive , specialist hospital , so it does not take into account animals that have not been given the very best care from their owners			2
she said the research is biased in its selection			0
neutering is the removal of all or part of an animal 's reproductive organs			0
vets and animals charities recommend the procedure to prevent the births of unwanted litters of puppies and cats			2
behaviours such as mounting and urine spraying , as well as some forms of male aggression , can be stopped because of the reduction in hormone levels in neutered animals			0
there is weak evidence that spaying reduces the risk of mammary tumours in female dogs			0
the risk of ovarian cancer and testicular cancer is removed , because the animals no longer have these organs			0
however , animals are at risk of complications from the procedure itself			0
spaying and neutering cats may boost the risk of obesity , because a decrease in sex hormone levels is associated with an increase in food intake			0
researchers claim that neutered dogs are at a two-fold excess risk to develop osteosarcoma ( bone cancer ) as compared to intact dogs			2
studies of cardiac tumours in dogs showed that there was a 5 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma - cancer of blood vessel lining - in spayed females than intact females and a 2.4 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma in neutered dogs as compared to intact males			1
the 2014 paper may be flawed in the same way , she explained , because although data was collected online , the survey was probably filled in by diligent dog owners who had seen it on canine - focused online communities			0
owners also filled in their dog ’s medical history , so it may not be accurate			0
‘ the studies both have their limitations , which makes their findings difficult to trust or generalise to other populations of dogs , ’ she said			0
another 2013 study by the @entity213 , based on data from a number of referral hospitals , found that spayed and neutered @entity11 , lived longer on average than those with their reproductive organs kept intact			1
they found that dogs with their genitals intact were more likely to die of trauma or infectious diseases , while those that had been neutered were more susceptible to cancer or immune - mediated diseases			2
the experts concluded that while spayed and neutered dogs were more likely to get cancer , it did n’t automatically shorten their lifespans			2
the study suggests that animals that had had the procedure lived long enough to get cancer , while those that did not , were more likely to die younger without reaching the time in life where the risk of cancer rises .			1

two studies hint spayed or neutered pets are at *higher* risk of cancers
study by @entity27 found a link between the practice in @entity11 and mast cell cancer and hemangiosarcoma
another by @entity48 found a link between neutered @entity44 and mast cell cancer , lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma
most vets still recommend the medical procedure for pets and more research is needed to confirm possible links with cancer
