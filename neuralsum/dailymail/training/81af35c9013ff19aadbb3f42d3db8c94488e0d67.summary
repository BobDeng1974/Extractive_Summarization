by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 07:27 est , 25 march 2013 the @entity1 who pulled down a giant statue of @entity4 in one of the most iconic moments of the @entity8 war has spoken of his doubts about the controversial conflict			1
@entity12 's face was seen around the world after he climbed up onto the dictator 's image in @entity16 and brought it crashing to the ground			1
but now he asks what the @entity19 was doing in the @entity21 in the first place - and blames the @entity23 for abandoning the country to ' radicals and insurgents ' in the aftermath of the invasion			1
iconic : @entity12 as he fastened a noose around a statue of @entity4 in @entity16 in 2003 destruction : the noose was attached to a tank which dragged the 40ft statue to the ground mr @entity12 , 34 , signed up to the @entity1 in 1999 hoping to earn money for college			1
the @entity19 declared war on @entity4 's dictatorial regime in march 2003 - 10 years ago last week - and quickly overwhelmed his under - powered troops			2
on april 9 , 2003 , mr @entity12 was part of a troop of @entity1 who arrived in @entity16 's @entity43 , which was dominated by a 40ft statue of the long - serving leader			1
he climbed up onto the statue and tied a noose around its neck which was then attached to a powerful @entity50 tank , which brought the icon down to cheers from the @entity8 bystanders , who then hit the statues with their shoes as a sign of disrespect			0
patrol : but mr @entity12 , left , now says he does not know the point of the @entity19 invasion of @entity8 however , 10 years later mr @entity12 is not sure that there was any reason for him to be in @entity8 at all , asking : ' what did we go there for ? ' he told the @entity66 : ' as @entity1 , we just do our jobs			1
we go where we are told			0
we hope that our leaders make the right decisions			0
' the @entity1 from @entity71 in @entity72 says it was no surprise when @entity4 's much - heralded weapons of mass destruction turned out not to exist			2
' we were n't really looking for them , ' he claimed - even though @entity77 were supposed to be the justification for the war , which claimed the lives of nearly 4,500 @entity19 troops and 179 @entity83 fighters			0
hero : mr @entity12 pictured during a @entity86 game at @entity87 after his moment in the spotlight mr @entity12 spreads the blame for the apparent failure of the @entity23 's mission in @entity8 evenly between the @entity19 leadership and the @entity8 people themselves			1
' i feel they really do n't know what they want , ' he told the @entity66			0
' they did n't want @entity4 in power			0
but they do n't seem to want democracy either			0
' the former @entity1 criticised the @entity23 for presiding over a brutal civil war stoked up by @entity104 , saying : ' we let it fall back into the hands of the radicals and insurgents			1
' in the decade since the invasion , the country has been plagued by a conflict between the majority @entity112 - backed by @entity104 's theocratic government - and the @entity115 who dominated @entity8 during @entity4 's time despite being in the minority			2
dictator : after the fall of @entity4 , @entity8 descended into civil war stoked up by @entity104 since leaving the military , mr @entity12 has worked hard to rebuild his life - despite becoming embroiled in a divorce , he found love again and is now engaged			2
he is working as an architect - and one commission in particular reminded him of his old life , and of how lucky he was to leave @entity8 unhurt			0
poignantly , mr @entity12 was part of a team which designed a new home for @entity132 , a soldier from @entity72 who lost his arms and legs while serving in the country .			0

@entity12 's face was seen around the world during 2003 invasion
