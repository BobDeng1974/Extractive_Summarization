after two terrorist attacks in @entity1 in a week left two @entity1 soldiers dead , @entity3 has stepped up its rhetoric calling for even more radicals to carry out mass murder and mayhem in the country			1
an even more horrifying fact is that an estimated 130 @entity11 youths in @entity1 have been seduced and radicalized by @entity3 and have even left @entity1 behind to join forces with them			1
the first attack happened monday night - a hit - and - run by suspected jihadist @entity14			1
jihadist tweets : @entity3 supporters have taken to @entity17 to call upon more lone wolf terrorist attacks in @entity1 the gunman : alleged jihadist @entity21 was shot during an attack against @entity1 on october 20 and supporters of @entity3 have been glamorizing him online ever since the second strike was carried out by a gunman on wendesday on @entity26 in @entity27			1
one of the shooters , @entity1 national @entity21 , was shot dead , @entity29			2
ever since @entity1 announced their involvement in the coalition against @entity3 , jihadist supporters have taken to @entity17 to call for ' justice ' in the hopes to shake the country ’s nerves by instilling fear and terror			1
one such @entity17 account is that of @entity40 who has tweeted several calls for attack and commented on @entity44 's attack on october 21 , 2014			2
' @entity11 in @entity1 , follow the footsteps of our brave brother @entity14 who took revenge for @entity1 military aggression in our lands , ' he wrote			1
one day later his account was suspended			0
@entity53 reports that a second jihadist @entity17 account posted on october 21 and said that @entity1 is ' starting to pay the price of intervention ' of the war against @entity3 and followed up with a second tweet urging more attacks			1
' a @entity1 revert killed a @entity1 soldier then he earned @entity62 at the hands of the kuffar all this reward			2
. without evn leaving @entity1			2
' gaining support : jihadists are hoping that by posting their opinions on @entity17 more youths will join @entity3 on the same user 's @entity72 account a different anonymous user commented on the fact that @entity75 attacked soldiers and not civilians			1
' @entity14 was not cowardly ... he attacked soldiers , not civilians			0
' the writer of the post responded , ' yep			0
' @entity53 adds that on the next day , the same jihadist commented on the shootings by saying , ' @entity83 told to leave their uniforms at home when out in public			0
now they are like their allies the @entity88			0
' a separate allegedly @entity1 jihadist took to @entity17 to post an article about @entity14 's shooting and wrote it ' was only a matter of time ' ending with ' # is			1
' for jihadists on @entity17 , the attacks are not against fellow @entity1 citizens , rather they believe they are against soldiers fighting the @entity3 movement			1
' u kill innocent @entity11 in @entity103 , @entity104 and so on in the na , e of dfnding agnst terrorism and u lie to the masses , dnt be surprised			0
' spreading propaganda : @entity110 online personalities are calling upon youth to join forces with @entity3 the account of a fighter believed to be in @entity103 added , ' after @entity1 decided to bomb and murder @entity11 , supposedly just few bullets shook all of # @entity1			1
expected wasnt it ? # @entity119			0
' the @entity17 account of a @entity122 jihadist militant in @entity103 stated something along the same lines with , ' bomb innocent people in @entity103 / @entity127 and you expect roses and hus from @entity11 back home ? it 's called action / reaction			1
' another jihadist on @entity17 referenced @entity1 's shock after the attacks and claims they should have ' expected ' the retaliation			1
' it 's always stunning when a country that has brought violence and military force to numerous countries acts shocked and bewildered			0
when someone brings a tiny faction of that violence back to that country			0
it 's not the slightest bit surprising or difficulty to understand why people who identify with those on the other end of the @entity1 bombs			0
and bullets would decide to attack the military responsible for that violence			0
' the wave of @entity1 joining @entity3 has fueled citizens , many of them @entity11 , to fight against the radicalization of youth in the country			1
shooting : @entity21 shot dead a soldier guarding the national war memorial before storming into the parliament on wednesday and was later shot dead inside the parliament after firing multiple shots one such person is @entity172 , whose son @entity173 died fighting near the @entity103 city of @entity175 for jihadist causes			0

@entity186 reports that according to the @entity1 government there are about 130 jihadist fighters who 've left the country to fight but that the number is growing			1
unfortunately , the @entity11 community estimates that the number is already much higher			2
with the popularization of @entity17 and online forums as tools to express beliefs worldwide , radical youths are able to lure in other supporters from around the globe			2
@entity3 uses @entity17 to spread propaganda and call for lone wolf attacks			2
these attackers are later revered as demigods and used as bait to call other into action			0
@entity186 reports that having declared the western world full of hypocrites , radicalized youth see themselves as the chosen ones , turning to online radical imams and charismatic leaders			0
community leaders have coined this jihadist online support movement the ' sheikh @entity216 ' phenomenon .			2
