@entity3 officer @entity10 's rare collection of photos that have been preserved by his descendants show his devastation of the @entity4 the unique set of images provide a glimpse into what daily life in the trenches was like for a @entity3 officer pictures such as this one of @entity3 soldiers playing cards together next to their trenches ' garden ' give an insight into the reality of the boredom , as well as the violence , of warfare he also records for posterity the devastation that was wrought on @entity44			1
@entity16 took almost 1,000 photos while serving in the @entity46 and as an aerial photographer			1
while beautifully preserved by @entity16 's descendants , the unique window into the war has been hidden in a cupboard for almost a century			1
however , @entity16 's great grandson @entity52 has now launched an ambitious project to share the images and hopes to turn them into a book			1
software developer mr @entity52 only discovered the album 's existence during a thanks giving visit to his mother in 2011			1
he said the day before he was due to return to his home in @entity63 , @entity64 , she ' casually ' pulled it out to show him			0
mr @entity52 told @entity66 : ' i thought " this is incredible "			2
' there were hundreds of photos over a century old			0
' i am in publishing and spend a lot of time looking at stuff like this			2
i immediately knew it was something really special that lots of people needed to see			0
the albums and negatives have been preserved immaculately by @entity16 's family but they have only now been made public by his great - grandson @entity52 mr @entity52 now wants to turn the images into a photo book and is raising money to kickstart the project while sharing images of his great grandfather and friends online mr @entity52 feels a connection to his ancestor			1
he is one year younger than @entity16 ( pictured left and right with friends ) was when he was conscripted into the war the software developer said early photos seem to show the men playing at war and the first sets in the album show them having fun			1
pictured , two soldiers wrestle in the snow the smiling early portraits , such as this one left , are gradually replaced by images of devastation and dead soldiers ( right ) ' not only did lots of people need to see it , it was something that i needed to spread and share			2
' i hope people can get in touch with that understanding - how different life was back then			0
' mr @entity52 said he immediately felt a connection to the pictures of his great - grandfather			1
at 23 , he is just one year younger than his ancestor was when he was conscripted into the war			2
but they also look strikingly similar			0
mr @entity52 said the album is a ' real treasure ' and especially important because it tells the personal story of a @entity3 , when most of the photographs that remain are from the @entity128 ' side			2
the negatives have also been kept and among the collection is a box of more than 100 3d stereographs from the war			2
mr @entity52 , who is currently sharing the images through the @entity136 blog and on @entity137 , has spent the past two years researching the images			2
he has even visited @entity139 so he can compare some of the photos with how the sites look today			0
towards the end of the album , @entity16 's images increasingly begin to show the stark realities of the @entity4 mr @entity52 said the images , such as this one of men carrying heavy artillery and a @entity3 soldier posing , are a ' real treasure ' the relaxed early images in the album reflect the initial ease the @entity154 had in moving across @entity44 before the stalemate of the trenches @entity10 's early pictures show his friends relaxing together and posing for his photographs others pictures in the vast collection show the heavy artillery at the disposal of the @entity154 none of the pictures are annotated so mr @entity52 said one of the only clues to the time of year is if there is snow on the ground @entity16 survived the war and went to have a hugely successful career in @entity174 as an art director			1
he moved to @entity176 soon after the @entity177 where he worked on the @entity179 films and worked for @entity180			0
the family believe he was also the set designer for the classic @entity4 film , @entity182			0
next year is the 100th anniversary of the start of the war and mr @entity52 said the images are a crucial reminder of what life was like for soldiers on both sides of the devastating conflict			1
@entity16 had trained as an architect before being conscripted into the @entity154			1
as an aerial photographer , he was one of the first to chart battlefields and help create maps from the air , in biplanes and hot - air balloons			0
at the beginning of the album , the photographs of him and his friends look like a picture postcard to be sent home			0
but with every page turned , the reality of the war kicks in and mr @entity52 said by 1918 his great - grandfather was a staunch pacifist			1
mr @entity52 has spent the past two years researching the images and has even travelled to @entity139 to compare them to the actual sites because @entity16 was not an official photographer , his images show a different side to the @entity4 mr @entity52 said the personal images ' humanize a terrible war ' and how life was for those fighting on both sides he hopes the project will help people get in touch with @entity4 and is aptly timed as the 100 anniversary next year mr @entity52 said : ' i think that his album and his photos are humazing of this really terrible war			1
' he tells a brilliant story			0
the first pictures are of him and his friends going off to war			0
' at the beginning of the album they are almost playing at war - they are swimming in lakes and taking photos			2
they are almost glamour shots			0
' when you reach the middle of the album the aerial shots ' there are pictures of a crashed airplane ' towards the end of the album you really see his understanding of what they are doing			0
' he stops taking photos of his friends			0
it is pretty much taking photos of destroyed churches , of dead men in the trenches , blown up tanks			0
' it 's scary stuff			0
' the poignant images also put faces to just some of the hundreds of thousands of forgotten people who died in the war			2
