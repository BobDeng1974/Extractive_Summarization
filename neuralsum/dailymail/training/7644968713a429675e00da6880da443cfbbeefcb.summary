when a lobster turned up a conservation centre filled with eggs and missing both its claws and half of its legs , prospects looked bleak			1
but in an extraordinary quirk of nature the lobster managed to regrow its four missing legs as well as its distinctive claws in record time			1
dubbed @entity13 , the lobster shocked staff at the @entity15 in @entity16 by regrowing her limbs in just one moult - the regeneration process of lobsters			1
clawdia the lobster was missing four arms and both claws and managed to grow them all in one process the crustacean regnerated four of her legs and both her claws in a single moult after four months at the centre @entity31 , a senior technician at the centre , said : ' she was brought in by one of the fishermen as she was full of eggs			1
' we put her in our hatchery , as we do with all our lobsters			0
but she was n't in a very good condition and was missing half of her legs			1
' but luckily she has moulted in a reasonable amount of time			0
there appeared not only all legs but also two perfect little claws			1
' @entity13 came to the hatchery about four months ago and will be kept thee until the new year when her shell has hardened again			1
this becomes soft during the regeneration process			1
mr @entity31 said being able to see her regrow so many limbs was very unique			1
' it 's very unusual , ' he added			2
' it 's not unusual for lobsters to regenerate but they usually do this in the sea			2
but we were able to actually witness this			0
she grew everything back all at once			0
' clawdia the lobster was brought into the hatchery in @entity16 heavily laden with legs and missing vital limbs mr @entity31 said @entity13 was likely to have lost her limbs and her claws by fighting other lobsters , which is common among the crustaceans			1
@entity72 a scientist at the facility added : ' we 've never seen anything quite like this			0
' she may have lost the limbs fighting or from a predator attack			2
' but to regrow them all so fast is amazing			2
' @entity81 , director of the @entity82 at the @entity83 , said : ' lobsters can regenerate their limbs			2
it will take several moults and years to obtain full size			0
' lobsters grow by shedding their exoskeleton which is known as moulting			0
as this happens their body tissues absorb water and they swell , rupturing the exoskeleton			0
when this occurs a new exoskeleton begins to harden - a process that can take from a few hours to several weeks			0
during each moult the length of a lobster increases by up to 15 per cent and its weight can double			2
lobsters can regrow their limbs by moulting after a successful moult the lobster eats its old exoskeleton , giving the animal the calcium it needs to harden its new shell			1
appendages and limbs can be regenerated through the moulting period but this can make it last longer			0
young lobsters can moult up to five times a year whereas for adults this may take place every two years			0
all lobsters continue to grow throughout their lives .			0

lobster laden with eggs was missing both claws and four of her legs
she was brought into @entity15 in @entity16 to hatch eggs
dubbed ' @entity13 ' , the lobster managed to regrow her limbs and her claws
*workers* said it was very unusual to see regeneration happen so *quickly*
