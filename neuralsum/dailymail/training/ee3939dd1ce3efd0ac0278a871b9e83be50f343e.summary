it really will be @entity1 occasion – in terms of scale and location and not that sinking feeling – when @entity6 makes his bid for the @entity9 world super-bantamweight title on september 6			1
promoter @entity10 will stage @entity6 ’s challenge to @entity13 ’s @entity12 in a specially built arena on the site from which the @entity1 was launched in @entity16			1
the 16,000 - crowd - the biggest fight attendance ever in @entity19 – will assemble in a space around the new @entity21 and cranes of the old shipyard			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity6 talk about @entity12 battle ready : @entity12 and @entity6 ( right ) after the press conference on tuesday the temporary stands will be erected and then taken down , in quick fire - fashion , similar to the conversion of @entity29 for @entity31 ’s victory over @entity32			1
a rescued @entity1 stairway in the museum , as well as the slipway into which the great ill - fated ship was launched and the tug which pulled it into the water , will be used for @entity40 entertaining			0
the boxing set - up must be in and out quickly to accommodate the @entity42			0
this unique project has required the support of @entity19 ’s first minister @entity45			0
@entity6 himself is thrilled by the concept and said : ‘ i must n’t be letting anybody down here			0
‘ i ’m already virtually in shape for the fight			0
everybody in @entity52 expects me to win a world title as a matter of course but i know it ’s not as easy as that			0
big hitter : @entity6 is launching a bid for the @entity9 world super-bantamweight title ‘ i ’m preparing for a tough fight			1
’ this a rematch following @entity6 ’s earlier stoppage of @entity12 in an eliminator			1
but the @entity65 has regrouped since to beat @entity6 to the @entity9 belt			1
@entity12 claims : ‘ i have regained all my confidence from winning the title and i have no doubts about coming back to @entity16 to defend it			1
’ the idea for the very special setting was born , ironically , from @entity10 ’s memory of an open air fight in a huge temporary arena which used to be erected in the car park of @entity78 ’s @entity77 in @entity79			0
@entity10 lost his world title in 120 - degree heat there to @entity84 @entity83 in 1986			0
but he said : ‘ it will be a nostalgic venue but , trust me , there ’s not the same result for @entity6 this time			2
