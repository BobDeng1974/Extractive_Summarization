by @entity0 published : 05:56 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 20:49 est , 25 july 2013 an @entity2 sniper convicted of illegally stashing a pistol and 338 bullets in his bedroom was spared jail yesterday but left court with his reputation in tatters			1
a judge reluctantly gave sergeant @entity11 , 38 , a suspended two - year prison sentence but accused him of lying during his trial			1
@entity14 had claimed that a brain injury meant he made a ‘ false confession ’ to police that he brought the @entity17 9mm firearm home from @entity19 as a war trophy			1
and he blamed a comrade , known only as soldier n , for planting the weapon and ammunition in his bedroom			0
he said it was ‘ inconceivable ’ that @entity14 was unaware the pistol and live rounds were stored in a wardrobe and under his bed			0
judge @entity34 said the soldier had ‘ made up a spurious defence ’ and ‘ impugned the character ’ of a colleague			1
@entity14 , who had served on the frontline in @entity19 and @entity50 during an 18 - year career , ‘ endangered society ’ by keeping the firearm in an unsecured rented home near @entity2 headquarters in @entity55			1
citing the gun massacres in @entity57 in 1987 and @entity58 in 1996 , he said : ‘ this could have been a tempting target for burglars and if there had been a burglary and the weapon and ammunition had been taken , the consequences could have been terrifying			0
’ smile : the former sniper could have been jailed for up to five years and has already spent time in prison ordeal : @entity71 has spent £ 120,000 on his unsuccessful attempt to clear his name and may launch an appeal judge @entity34 also attacked the vigorous campaign , led by @entity14 ’s wife @entity29 and backed by @entity78 , after the soldier was jailed for 18 months over the charges last november			1
his conviction was later quashed and a retrial took place before a military court earlier this month			2
the sniper denied the charges but was found guilty and appeared for sentencing yesterday , when he was given two years ’ military detention suspended for 12 months			1
the judge said the campaign to clear his name had been ‘ misleading and uninformed ’ and criticism of the prosecution ‘ totally without foundation ’			2
he added : ‘ we understand how difficult these proceedings have been for you and your family			0
however , you have brought much of that anguish upon yourself and your public assertions that you are a scapegoat or the victim of some wider political agenda is nonsense			1
’ free : the @entity103 leave court today after it was announced that the sniper would avoid jail @entity107 : @entity71 spoke outside court about her relief at seeing her husband return home passing sentence , judge @entity34 criticised politicians who made ‘ unfounded and uninformed remarks under the cloak of parliamentary privilege			1
[ i hope they ] now realise how inappropriate and wrong their criticisms were			0
’ he told @entity14 that the crime was so serious it deserved an ‘ immediate custodial sentence ’			2
but he took into account the soldier ’s ‘ exceptional ’ record in the @entity124 and said he was ‘ constrained ’ by previous court rulings			0
police found the weapon at the home @entity14 shared with soldier n after a tip - off			2
the sniper told detectives he was given the glock by @entity19 troops he trained and that the ammunition was left over from his job as a range instructor			2
gun : the former sniper smuggled this weapon out of @entity19 and hid it in his bedroom but at his trial @entity14 insisted he had made a ‘ false confession ’ that he blamed on memory loss caused by a brain injury suffered when he collapsed during a charity run in the @entity148 jungle in 2009			2
he claimed that @entity149 , jailed after admitting possessing another @entity17 , brought both pistols back from @entity19 and planted one in his bedroom to avoid a tougher sentence			1
yesterday , @entity14 ’s wife @entity29 expressed anger at the comments of @entity156			0
‘ i feel quite upset that it ’s been suggested that we misled people because that ’s one thing we have not done , ’ she said outside the @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159			0
‘ we ’ve been very honest and open			0
‘ @entity11 is angry about the words used in court against his family and the people who have supported him			1
’ @entity14 ’s father , @entity168 , said the judge ’s remarks were ‘ a kick in the teeth ’			0
the soldier has received a medical discharge that will start on february 14 next year			0
until then he remains in the @entity124 .			0
