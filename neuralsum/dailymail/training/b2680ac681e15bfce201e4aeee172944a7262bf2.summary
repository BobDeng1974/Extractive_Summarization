this is serious because of course , it ’s the tax payer who pays such benefits - that hard - earned money is simply being passed to somebody that had no entitlement to it			0
' on a website @entity7 said : ' i took up @entity171 after a serious car accident which left me in a wheelchair			2
this was a therapeutic sport which i could do , however over the years i have regained the use of my legs and can now walk for short periods of time with the help of medication			0
