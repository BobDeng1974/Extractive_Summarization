@entity0 said the allegations against him are ' totally made up ' and ' provably untrue ' a @entity3 law professor named alongside prince @entity4 in his ' sex slave ' case has said he is ' fighting back ' against his accusers and is confident any success will help clear the royal 's name			1
@entity0 was named in court documents by a woman who says she was forced to have sex with friends of @entity16 billionaire and convicted pedophile @entity17 , including the @entity4			1
professor @entity0 has today said the allegations against him are ' not only totally made up ' but also ' provably untrue ' and is now challenging the claims with ' all the resources he can muster '			1
he said the prince is not able to make the same kind of public defence as being a member of the @entity25 limits his freedom to pursue legal action			2
but he added that any legal success he has against the woman - named by @entity30 as @entity31 - will work in the prince 's favour as it will establish his accuser lacks credibility			1
he has previously urged the @entity4 to fight back against claims the woman made that she was forced to have sex with the royal while she was a minor in the state of @entity41			2
she claims she had sex with the prince , a former friend of @entity17 , in @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48 while she was a ' sex slave '			1
@entity30 has denied all allegations			2
writing in the @entity53 today , professor @entity0 , who was part of @entity52 's ' dream team ' , sets out the accusations levelled against him , offering his alibi for each alleged encounter			2
in each instance , he explains what he was doing at the same time @entity60 # 3 - who was 17 at the time , making her a minor - has accused him of having a sexual encounter with her			0
he pointed out that the woman claims they had sex on @entity17 's @entity69 and at his @entity71 ranch , but @entity0 said he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter			2
in a third - when he is accused of having sex with @entity60 # 3 on a private plane - he said flight manifests would prove he was never on a private plane with her or any other under - age women			2
again , @entity0 , who represented @entity17 against sex crime charges , denies any sexual encounter with any under - age person			2
these claims are included in a sworn statement filed by @entity0 in a @entity41 court - one of a number of legal filings he has made in an attempt to publicly clear his name			1
@entity0 is not currently a target of the latest proceedings but is seeking to intervene in order to defend himself			0
@entity30 officials have denied the allegations against prince @entity4			1
@entity0 said any legal success he has against the woman - named by @entity30 as @entity31 ( pictured with the prince ) - will work in the royal 's favour as it will discredit his accuser last week , @entity0 filed defamation suits in both @entity47 and the @entity16 based on the lawyers ' public statements about the case and he urged prince @entity4 to do the same			1
in them , he said the allegation against him was a ' deliberate lie			0
' he has also challenged his accuser and her lawyers to sign sworn statements repeating their charges			0
also last week , @entity0 filed a motion in federal court to enter in a lawsuit brought against the @entity16 government by his accuser and other women who say @entity17 sexually abused them			1
the court has yet to decide whether to grant his motion			0
the two lawyers representing @entity60 # 3 , former federal judge @entity121 and @entity41 plaintiffs attorney @entity120 , have now filed counter-defamation charges against @entity0			0
@entity0 slammed his accuser 's lawyers , @entity120 ( left ) and @entity121 ( right ) , for naming him in the lawsuit			2
he claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied in his article today , he explained that this will subject them and their client to sworn depositions			0
if they repeat the charges under oath , and if they are untrue , they will be subject to prosecution for perjury			0
finally , @entity0 has also challenged his accuser to file formal rape charges against him			0
if she were to file a false rape charge , she would be committing a crime			0
she has not done so			0
the lawyer said the prince 's decision to pursue legal action - he has the right to sue his accuser - will depend on whether the @entity30 is willing to subject him to depositions about his private life			1
but @entity0 said his extensive legal action would be beneficial to prince @entity4 as it would serve to discredit his accuser			1
@entity60 # 3 claims she had sex with the prince , a former friend of @entity17 , in @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity158			0
@entity30 has denied all allegations			0
above , @entity17 and the prince in 2011 it comes just days after prince @entity4 's ex-wife @entity162 slammed reports that he had sex with an underage girl as ' salacious lies ' and defended him as a ' humongously good man '			1
in a passionate rebuttal on the today show on tuesday , the @entity162 said that she was standing by ' my best friend and my best ex-husband ever ' amid the allegations			0
prince @entity4 has come under fire over his friendship with convicted pedophile @entity17 , who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with the underage girl			1
in a strongly - worded statement , a palace spokesman said : ' it is emphatically denied that the @entity4 had any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity31			1
' the allegations made are false and without any foundation			0

@entity0 named alongside prince @entity4 in ' sex slave ' case
today he said allegations are ' totally made up ' but also ' provably untrue '
made number of legal filings to clear his name through @entity16 court *system*
said any success will discredit accuser , named as @entity31
