a 19 - year - old @entity1 university student called @entity2 has invented a futuristic propulsion system for spacecraft			1
the invention ' leapfrogs ' @entity7 research , and uses a hi - tech quantum effect to drive satellites through space , rather than ordinary rocket engines			1
@entity13 's invention generates energy using the @entity15 , an obscure quantum effect using two surfaces and objects in a vacuum			0
@entity13 's invention generates energy using the @entity15 , an obscure quantum effect using two surfaces and objects in a vacuum @entity13 says she hopes to test her invention on future space missions the force is described as an ' invisible rubber band ' between bulky objects and atoms that arises from the ever - present random fluctuation of microscopic electric fields in empty space			1
the fluctuations get stronger near a surface , and an isolated neutral atom nearby feels the force as a ' pull '			0
@entity13 's drive is n't exactly @entity40 material , but it provides enough energy for satellites to maneouvre gracefully through space			0
instead of using nuclear reactors or jets , @entity13 's satellites could generate drive using the panels			0
@entity7 had researched a similar idea using the @entity15 - with the idea of generating it around a ' sail ' floating in space			2
@entity13 's drive is n't exactly @entity40 material , but it provides enough energy for satellites to maneouvre gracefully through space she has patented her invention @entity55 of scientific research and technology ( @entity57 )			2
the 19 - year - old says she aims to test her invention in future space missions .			1

two *mirrors* used to generate power using weird quantum *physics*
leapfrogs @entity7 research into same subject
19 - year - old @entity1 hopes to test her invention on future space missions
