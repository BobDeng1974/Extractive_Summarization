' the @entity6 have used their expensive pr operation to influence the @entity2			2
' people are right to believe this is sinister censorship			0
this is not @entity52 - the @entity2 should be fearless and free to broadcast			2
' but the @entity2 should have held firm			0
we are being infantilised by broadcasters who are keeping the truth from us about the @entity6			0
' all this will do is increase pressure to have it shown and increase the number of people who will watch it when it is '			0
@entity64 , a senior mp on the @entity65 , told the @entity66 : ' we can not now have the @entity4 deciding what can and can not be shown on our national broadcaster			0
