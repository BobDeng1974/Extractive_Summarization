there is a football stadium in the tiny @entity3 settlement @entity4 , hometown of @entity6 , where the grass is long and dry and the nets have holes in them			2
the goalposts are square , not round , dating them to before 1987 when they were banned by @entity13			2
there are three white walls surrounding three of the sides and a wire mesh fence behind one of the goals			2
tall trees grow at one end and the hum of a busy main road nearby can be heard			2
@entity25 : @entity26 is a @entity28 winner with @entity29 and could now be set for @entity30 @entity32 bond : @entity33 is believed to have spoken to the @entity35 midfielder about the @entity37 life ' this is the stadium where @entity26 got famous , ' one local recalls			1
between the age of 10 and 15 , this is where @entity28 winner @entity6 , born in @entity42 to a @entity3 father and @entity32 mother , @entity44 , would often come to play when he visited			1
although he has always represented the @entity32 national side , from under 17s through to winning 51 caps for the seniors , @entity3 is a large part of his life			2
@entity6 explains : ' although @entity4 is not my home , it is the hometown of my father so it is also important for me			0
' my entire family lives there			0
my grandma and my grandpa live there as well as seven aunts and one uncle			0
i do n't even know how many cousins i have there			0
' @entity4 for me is a beautiful place for vacation			0
i really love to go there and visit my family			0
i like to relax on the beaches and to get away from my daily routine			0
it is the perfect place for a retreat , where i can feel at home			0
' on the move : @entity6 has not signed a new deal at @entity35 and is set to leave breakthrough : @entity6 started out at hometown club @entity42 in @entity29 @entity6 would also hone his football skills on the beaches when he would go on holiday there as a teenager			1
he joined @entity82 's youth team in 1995 , aged just eight , so by the time he was visiting his father 's family at 15 he was already a star in @entity4			1
it did not stop him returning to play with his peers on that pitch with overgrown bushes peering over the walls			0
' it was a great honour for our guys to learn from him , ' the same local recounts			0
' he is very friendly and generous , that 's why people like him			1
in particular they love his kindness			0
' @entity6 was a local hero , but back in @entity29 he was fast becoming a star , too			1
at @entity42 he won the @entity99 title in 2007 then captained the @entity29 under 21 side which won the @entity101 , beating @entity102 4 - 0 in the final			1
it was a team which included @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity33 , who would all also go on to win the @entity28 in 2014			1
swoop : @entity30 have already signed @entity109 for £ 30million and are considering @entity6 for £ 20m a year later he earned a move to @entity35 where he has since won a @entity112 title , two @entity114 cups and the @entity115			1
after winning the @entity28 , @entity6 's stock is at an all - time high and his refusal to sign a new deal at @entity35 , with only a year left to run on his contract , has meant they are willing to cash in			1
@entity30 see him as the ideal man to plug the gap in their midfield			1
@entity126 's side is crammed with attack - minded midfielders and forwards – @entity129 , @entity33 , @entity130 , @entity109 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 – but lack a defensive midfield linchpin			1
@entity135 did a job there last season but he is not world class			0
if an agreement can be met , that humble man who grew up playing on a tatty , battered pitch in @entity4 might well be the perfect fit .			2

@entity35 midfielder is a £ *20million* target for @entity30
he missed *sunday* 's @entity28 final **victory** after *injuring* his calf in the warm - up
@entity29 star had been man - of - the - match in the 7 - 1 *semi-final* **victory** over @entity155
