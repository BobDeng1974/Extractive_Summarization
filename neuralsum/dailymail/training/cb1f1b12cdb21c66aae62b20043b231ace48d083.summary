a woman who was told she would never become a mother because she suffers from a heart condition is to have her dream of a family come true - thanks to a total stranger who offered to donate her eggs and a friend who is acting as a surrogate			1
@entity9 from @entity10 in @entity12 's south , who calls her situation a ' love story ' , will have a little one to call her own in four weeks when her best friend gives birth to a baby boy created with her husband 's sperm and a @entity23 mother 's donated egg			1
the 32 - year - old was first diagnosed with cardiomyopathy , a condition that doctors warned could result in her suffering a stroke if she carried a child , at the age of 21			1
doctors warned mrs hill that she was likely to suffer a stroke if she fell pregnant ' when i was 21 , having a baby was n't high on my priority list , ' @entity9 told @entity50			1
' my best friend , who is now my sister - in - law [ @entity36 ] , when we realised it would be hard for me to have a baby , would always joke " do n't worry , i 'll have one for you " and i 'd just laugh at her and did n't think it was possible			1
' after marrying @entity36 's brother - in - law @entity42 in 2009 , who @entity9 describes as the man of her dreams , she realised that her desire to have a baby and raise a family was a physical impossibility			1
' i sort of kept my pain really private between my husband and i – it 's hard to be upset when another woman in your life has a baby or announces their pregnancy			2
you do n't look nice when you 're the one with tears in your eyes because you 're sad about your situation , ' she said			0
' my husband talked me through it – he 's a man of few words but when he does say something he really means it			2
' he said to me : " if i ca n't have a baby with you , if i ca n't raise them with you , then i do n't want to do it at all "			0
' instead , the couple focused on their nephews and nieces , spending extra time with each of them and getting very involved in their lives			0
but it was during one particularly difficult @entity94 in 2012 that @entity9 received an offer that her heart could n't refuse			0
' i 'd had a particularly hard @entity94 not being a mum and being around lots of babies – they bring a lot of joy but it can also be a heartache – and @entity36 said : " look , i 've finished my family - my daughter 's four , my son is two - so let 's do this , i 'm ready again " , ' @entity9 said			1
@entity36 ( centre ) who has known @entity9 since they were 18 - years - old , used to joke with her saying , ' do n't worry i 'll have a baby for you ' when they were younger just to cheer her up it was during a particularly difficult @entity94 for @entity9 that @entity36 said : ' look , i 've finished my family - my daughter 's four , my son is two - so let 's do this , i 'm ready again ' ' @entity36 is a really pragmatic woman – she would n't say something she did n't mean			1
' ' now she 's very set on this idea that '' this is my nephew , i 'm carrying my nephew " , ' @entity9 said of her best friend ( pictured ) ' now she 's very set on this idea that '' this is my nephew , i 'm carrying my nephew "			2
' the two women began their research and found that their dream could be made a reality through @entity128 – until @entity9 was hit with another crushing blow			2
' i found out i needed an egg donor			0
my egg supply was extremely low , i 'd probably be able to retrieve one egg and i would have to also carry out some genetic testing to make sure i was n't going to pass on the heart condition i live with , ' @entity9 said			2
' but i found @entity135 online and they 're a huge group of women who donate their eggs because they want other women to become mothers too – it 's beautiful			0
' @entity9 was introduced to @entity39 , a single @entity23 mother - of - one who is a strong advocate for egg donation and has given 11 embryos to women struggling to conceive , and a friendship flourished between them			1
' we went to @entity148 to meet her and her little boy @entity149 and we just really clicked , we 've known each other for 18 months but you would n't know it – the first time we spoke on the phone we spoke for two hours solid , ' @entity9 said			0
' she has an amazing attitude , she just wants to give someone else the chance to be the mum that she loves being			0
' @entity39 , who has been very involved with the pregnancy and flew down from her @entity160 home to attend @entity9 's baby shower , said she chose to donate her eggs to the desperate couple herself			1
' i had seen her thread and they 're just so supportive - the love she gave everyone even though they were going through a hard time themselves was beautiful , ' she told @entity50			0
@entity23 mother , @entity39 ( pictured with her four - year - old son @entity149 ) offered to donate her eggs to @entity9 after she was told her own egg count was too low @entity36 is now four weeks away from giving birth ( left ) to the child which @entity9 ( pictured right as a child ) never imagined she had the possibility of having @entity36 ( pictured ) has been keeping the others updated on the size of her stomach while @entity39 issues jest apologies to the heavily pregnant surrogate for ' knocking her up ' ' it feels like your best friend is having a baby , that ’s how invested you are			1
there 's pride and joy and elation			0
' the trio are now four weeks away from the birth of @entity9 's little boy and the excitement is starting to show : the mother - to - be has completed setting up her nursery while @entity36 keeps the others updated on the size of her stomach and @entity39 issues jest apologies to the heavily pregnant surrogate for ' knocking her up '			1
' the moment @entity36 had the embryo transfer and two weeks later the blood transfer , the nurse rang me to let me know it had worked and i went into shock			2
they had to call me back in the afternoon to ask if i was ok			0
the mother - to - be has completed setting up her nursery ( pictured ) : ' at 20 weeks , when we found out he was a boy , that 's when i realised " this is real , he 's coming and he 's going to live in my house and call me mum " , ' she said @entity9 has now made her story public to inspire other mothers like her , that ' there really is no end to the road – there are so many options these days ' ' it 's something you hope for but do n't dare believe it will happen			1
' we passed the 12 week scan with flying colours and at 20 weeks , when we found out he was a boy , that 's when i realised " this is real , he 's coming and he 's going to live in my house and call me mum "			0
