considering the weight of opposition building up against them over the @entity4 controversy , taking on the 11 men of @entity6 must have felt like an altogether more even contest for @entity7			1
as the issue escalated dramatically on wednesday , those taking a stand against the decision to allow the convicted rapist to train with his old club included the deputy prime minister , a local mp , a @entity15 presenter , a 1960s pop star and two club sponsors , not to mention 157,000 people who have signed a petition			1
against this rather toxic backdrop , @entity19 and his team had to play a @entity23 quarter - final against @entity6 at the @entity24			1
they lost it 1 - 0			1
@entity4 will start training with his former club , despite opposition from some @entity7 fans @entity4 is to marry his fiancee @entity30 after proposing shortly after he was released from prison @entity7 manager @entity19 has said @entity4 ' future is ' nowhere near being decided ' ' i think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on , you are not taking just a footballer these days , you are also taking on a role model , ' @entity33 told @entity41			1
' you are taking on a role model , particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that , and he has committed a very serious crime			2
' it is for the football club to decide , but i really do think that footballers these days , they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people			0
' i 'm sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of @entity7			2
' @entity19 maintains that a permanent return for @entity4 is ‘ nowhere near being decided ’ , but there will surely come a point when the club have to assess if it is really worth the trouble			1
after the match , the manager was asked if there is a danger of the club ’s reputation being damaged			0
‘ you ’ll have to speak to the owners about that , ’ said @entity19			0
‘ it ’s their sphere of influence rather than us trying to win football matches			0
’ for a few hours at least , football was back on the agenda with 500 blades fans making the trip to the @entity87			0
there was no repeat of the @entity91 chants that have been heard since his release from prison last month			0
after another day of moral debate , it was back to business			0
the @entity7 players are expected in for a warm - down on thursday			2
although @entity4 has not trained with the first - team squad yet , it is understood that he has already done some light exercise at his old club as he tries to regain fitness after serving half of his five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old woman in a @entity108 hotel room			1
one dressing - room source said that the players are open - minded about the possibility of @entity4 rejoining the club who paid him £ 20,000 - a - week before his incarceration in april 2012			1
that is not a mood shared by an increasingly vocal opposition to the idea of such a move			0
@entity119 has decided to resign from her role as patron of @entity7 after @entity4 ' return while the @entity126 , who first approached @entity7 about allowing @entity4 to train with them , and the club itself have acknowledged the 25 - year - old ’s right to rehabilitation after serving his punishment , those set against it are concerned by the former @entity136 striker ’s apparent lack of remorse			1
@entity4 has apologised to his girlfriend @entity30 for being unfaithful but has always maintained that he is innocent of rape			2
his application to appeal is expected to be heard by the @entity142 in the next three months			0
@entity33 , the deputy prime minister and @entity145 mp , urged the @entity147 club to ‘ think long and hard ’ about taking him back			1
deputy prime minister @entity33 does not believe @entity4 should be given the chance to return to the club @entity150 , the @entity151 mp for @entity152 and a club shareholder , went a step further by writing an open letter to @entity7 ’s co-chairmen @entity156 and @entity157			1
he wrote : ‘ the way this issue has been handled by the club is dragging our name through the mud and dividing fans			0
i really hope that you will reflect further and change your mind			0
’ that followed @entity15 presenter @entity119 becoming the first of three club patrons to resign over the issue			1
@entity119 , who has previously revealed that she was sexually abused as a teenager , said : ‘ i do n't believe it is morally right for a convicted rapist , who has still shown no remorse , to go and train with the club because it is trivialising rape			2
‘ i feel really uneasy that a convicted rapist will be possibly be cheered on by the next generation , by young men that at that moment in time , are still making decisions on how to treat women and what sexual consent is			0
’ another @entity7 patron , 60s singer @entity186 , stood down because he ‘ needed to take a moral stand ’ , and school food health expert @entity188 followed suit citing personal reasons			2
meanwhile two of the club ’s main sponsors , @entity196 and @entity197 , also warned that they would re-evaluate their deals if @entity4 is re-signed			2
as he builds towards a possible comeback , the storm gathering around him is showing no signs of going away			0

deputy prime minister @entity33 is among those who are against @entity4 returning to training
television presenter @entity119 has quit her role a club patron
@entity7 lost 1 - 0 against @entity6 in the @entity23
