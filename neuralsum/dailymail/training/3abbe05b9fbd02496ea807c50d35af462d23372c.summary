they are the strays that spend their lives on the streets in @entity4 , with nobody to care for them			1
but thankfully this six - week - old puppy is given the care it needs after concerned passers - by spotted that it was riddled with parasites			1
in a disturbing video filmed by a charitable veterinary clinic , the distressed animal is seen whimpering as it has hundreds of worms squeezed from under its skin			2
the video was filmed by the organisation @entity20 after holidaymaker dr. @entity21 , from @entity22 , realised there were no facilities to look after them and set up a veterinary surgery in 2009			1
the puppy was brought it after a @entity29 ex-pat spotted it on the streets of @entity31 and realised it needed treatment			1
mangoworm infestations , caused by the mango fly laying eggs and larvae growing under the skin of animals , is a key problem in @entity4			1
this young visitor in particular was lucky to be picked up by the caring vets , after becoming riddled with thousands of the maggots			0
squeezing out the worms , measuring between 3 - 4mm in diameter , the vet films the procedure as the puppy whimpers in the background			1
the larvae of the parasite , known by its scientific name @entity52 , settle under the skin of hosts , both animal and human , and grow there until they can emerge and drop off			0
the young puppy is clearly in distress as the worms are squeezed from under its skin close - up from the video show the sizeable parasites emerging from the dog 's wounds with one woman counting in the background , the video shows 50 worms being squeezed from the distressed puppy 's leg in the space of just a couple of minutes			1
the vet then moves on to release more worms from the puppy 's stomach and other legs			2
the veterinary surgery told @entity82 : ' they are very common in @entity4 , every dog and gets them sooner or later			1
the puppy is estimated to be six weeks old and was found on the streets of the @entity86 ' usually the infestation is not bad , adult dogs can stand up to 100 maggots without being seriously affected			2
you will see / feel a lump under the skin and have to squeeze it out once the maggot is 3 - 4mm in diameter			0
to squeeze before wo n't work as the maggot has spikes and holds on to its host			0
' the surgery spokesperson goes on to explain : ' they have to come out , that 's the only way			0
either when they are ready and fully developed by themselves , or by the owner / caretaker before that			0
' the problem is that owner / caretaker often does not give a sh * * or does not exist , we have a huge amount of dogs on the streets of the @entity4			1
that 's my main work			0
' the vat can be heard explaining that removing parasites is one of the most common jobs he performs the charitable veterinary surgery aims to educate and raise money to tackle issues in @entity4 by uploading the videos to @entity125 , where the surgeons and assistants have a loyal group of followers			1
commenting under the video , which has had more than four million views , animal lovers worry about the outcome for the young dog			0

hope the little guy made it and found a good home			0
