by the time @entity2 caught up with all the transfer comings and goings before he went to bed on monday night , @entity1 clubs had spent more than £ 800million this summer			1
most of that was on overseas signings , adding to the glamour of the @entity1 and damaging the future of the national team by reducing the chances for young @entity15 players			1
@entity2 recognises that the appeal of the @entity1 and the phenomenal salaries on offer are major dangers to our national team			1
facing the media : @entity2 speaks to assembled press ahead of @entity23 's friendly on wednesday three @entity24 : @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 at @entity23 's @entity29 base on monday ‘ obviously the @entity1 is a great league and players want to come and play in it — that ’s a big part of it , ’ said the @entity23 midfielder			1
‘ if they do well against @entity23 , they might feel as though they can come and get an opportunity to play in @entity23			2
‘ it ’s one of the best leagues in the world , so that ’s a part of it			0
’ last weekend the @entity43 — @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 — fielded 11 @entity15 players between them			1
two of those , @entity50 and @entity52 , are no longer available for international duty			0
@entity2 is a deep thinker , a decent guy who accepts that @entity57 ’s squad failed the country when they returned home from the @entity60 without a win			2
at @entity23 ’s hotel on monday , he nominated @entity52 and @entity26 as two players from that failed mission who could have got into @entity67 ’s triumphant squad			1
‘ @entity52 and @entity26 are world - class players , ’ he said			0
‘ we also have a lot of young players who could get to that level , such as @entity74			0
with the right mentality and the right coaching , they could get there			0
‘ @entity67 won the @entity60 , so they are operating on a very high level and a level we want to get to			0
they did very well at the @entity60			0
they had a bit of luck at times , which you need			0
they are a good unit , they are defensively solid and great going forward			0
’ centre of attention : @entity2 in action against @entity90 during @entity44 's 3 - 0 victory on sunday battle : former @entity93 star @entity2 has become an integral part of @entity44 and @entity23 's midfield indeed , it will be difficult for any team to match a side comprising @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
and the truth is that no - one fears this @entity23 team , not even wednesday ’s opponents @entity108			1
@entity57 ’s squad are fragile			0
they need to stare out the opposition in the tunnel and make sure they know they will be in a game when they take on @entity23			1
instead of instilling fear in their opponents , @entity23 are frightened			2
‘ playing for @entity44 and @entity23 is totally different , ’ @entity2 admitted			1
‘ people have to fear @entity23 and not want to play us			2
the only way to do that is to play at a higher tempo and win games			0
on the ball : @entity52 and @entity50 ( right ) were among the 11 @entity15 to feature for the ' @entity43 ' ‘ at @entity44 , the philosophy under @entity127 got driven into the players and we have improved all the time			1
he got his messages across well			0
hopefully we can carry on and progress as individuals and bring that to @entity23 as best we can			2
’ @entity136 ’ ability to get the best from his team was clear on sunday , when @entity2 played with control and composure in the centre of @entity44 ’s midfield alongside @entity143 and former @entity23 captain @entity52			1
@entity2 is a maturing voice around the @entity23 camp and he knows the stakes have been raised after the @entity147 admitted they only expect around 40,000 fans at @entity150 on wednesday evening			1
people do n’t trust this team , the manager or the @entity147 and @entity2 is sharp enough to accept that is the price to pay for a shocking @entity60			1
@entity156 : @entity157 arrives at @entity23 training with @entity159 ( left ) and @entity160 ‘ we have to go out there and show we deserve to be in the @entity23 team , show how much we care and show how good we are , ’ added @entity2			1
‘ there ’s going to be 40 - odd thousand there , which is low for @entity150 but still a good turn - out to watch a game			2
‘ i do n’t think it will affect us too much and hopefully they can support us as much as possible and we can show them how much it matters to us and make them want to go to the games			0
‘ we are expected to do well but whoever says that players do n’t care about putting on an @entity23 shirt is talking nonsense			1
training : @entity179 and @entity180 in action as @entity23 prepare to face @entity108 later this week ‘ every player with this squad definitely cares			1
if you had been in the dressing room after the @entity187 game , you would see how much we care as players			2
’ the tear - stained shirts are all well and good , but what the nation demands is some evidence that @entity23 can one day go deep into tournaments			2
they are a million miles away at the moment			0
@entity2 knows that , but in the absence of @entity52 and @entity198 , he will take on more responsibility			2
he is a first - choice player now			0
‘ when you play for @entity23 there is always going to be pressure , that is normal , ’ he added			0
against @entity108 , it must be the start of a whole new era			0
end of an era : @entity198 , on loan at @entity46 , announced his international retirement last month			0

@entity44 midfielder understands that the appeal of @entity1 and mega wages on offer are dangers to the @entity23 team
@entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 fielded just 11 players between them last weekend
@entity2 expected to be part of @entity23 's midfield in game against @entity108
