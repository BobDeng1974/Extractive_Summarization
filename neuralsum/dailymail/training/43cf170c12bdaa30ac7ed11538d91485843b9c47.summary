there are many odd sports taken up by thrill - seekers looking for that next adrenaline rush , but a new game of @entity6 roulette using @entity7 must surely be one of the most extreme - and bizarre			1
the sport sees a group of hardcore pain addicts electrocuting themselves with the weapons , which shoot out two electrical darts through which courses 50,000 volts of electricity			1
pictures show the competitors - many of them shirtless - holding ' guns ' to each others heads , or their own heads , before firing them			0
but it seems the fun of the game is not getting shocked , but rather ' surviving ' to fight another round			0
players claim the shock is a bit like being punched			2
however , if a player ' survives ' the first round , a second live cartridge is placed in the gun which doubles the chance of them firing the weapon into their body			2
as each round continues the number of cartridges increases accordingly			0
and if people get bored with just shooting just one person , there is the ' @entity67 ' where three players face off against each other however , the game is still probably a more sensible option than the original version of @entity6 roulette , which uses actual bullets and comes with a substantial risk of death			1
and there is an added bonus for the winner , who gets to take home the 200 roubles - about £ 2 - each player has paid to take part			1
very lucky players even win competitions , medals - not to mention the respect of their competitors			2
the winners - the last man or woman standing - take home the money collected from the 200 rouble entrance fee if people get bored with just shooting just one person , there is the ' @entity67 ' where three players face off against each other it is said the game was invented by an ex-champion fighter , who wanted to find a new thrill after injury ended his career the game is named @entity27 - after the industrial city on the edge of the @entity104 where the participants live			1
according to local legend , it was invented by former champion fighter @entity108 , who invented it after realising his days in the ring were over due to an injury			0
however , whether the game is risk free remains to be seen : people suffering from epilepsy are banned from playing in case a shock induces a seizure			0
meanwhile , there are questions in the @entity120 - where @entity7 are regularly used by police forces - about the safety of the weapons .			0

players have a one - in - seven chance of being electrocuted by the weapon
tasers shoot out 10,000 volts but players say it is like being punched
people *pay* 200 roubles - about £ 2 - to take part in the game
