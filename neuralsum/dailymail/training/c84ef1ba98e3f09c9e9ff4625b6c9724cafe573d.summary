when @entity1 smashed a devastating hat - trick past @entity3 in the colours of @entity5 , we longed for his arrival in the @entity7			1
this was a player made for the @entity11 top - flight ; pace , power , panache and potency - @entity1 had the ingredients to succeed on these shores			1
now he is here - after a long - term knee injury - but the @entity22 loanee is a sorry imitation of the striker who terrorised the @entity25 in the @entity26 of 2012			1
@entity22 striker @entity1 looks a shadow of his former self at @entity29 this season @entity1 arrived in @entity11 to much fanfare but the @entity32 striker has failed to light up the @entity7 gone are the razor - sharp reactions of mind and body			1
gone also is the swagger which was deserving of his superiority , for @entity1 was the best centre forward in @entity40 as he plundered 32 goals for @entity5 in the campaign which followed his destruction of @entity3			1
he was the most coveted frontman on the continent but ended up at @entity45			2
money – a £ 52million transfer fee and £ 10m salary – talked			0
it was there that he suffered the cruciate ligament injury which robbed him of a place at the @entity53			1
on the evidence of his efforts for @entity22 – whom he joined in a £ 6m loan deal in september – that injury robbed him of a whole lot more than a summer in @entity60			1
@entity1 terrorised the @entity3 defence playing for @entity5 in the @entity26 of 2012 @entity1 moved to @entity45 from @entity5 for £ 52million in 2013 before moving to @entity22 on loan @entity1 suffered a cruciate - ligament injury following a challenging during a @entity65 game in january the striker had to leave the field on a stretcher and subsequently missed the @entity53 last sunmer in @entity60 he has just two goals from 11 appearances and only now does @entity72 appear to trust the 28 - year - old with successive starts			1
he failed to break sunday ’s stalemate at @entity76 and fluffed the one chance which did come his way			0
the energy and endeavour which was always married to his goals is on the increase , it seems , but strikers are not judged on distance run or tackles made			0
rather , goals are the currency in which they trade and , to that end , @entity1 ’s return is poor in comparison to his sizeable wage packet			2
and therein lies the conundrum for @entity93 and the @entity22 hierarchy			2
@entity1 , pictured against @entity76 's @entity95 , failed to break the deadlock at @entity97 on sunday at 28 , is a player whose reputation currently outweighs his return on the pitch – not to mention his salary – really worth a £ 50m investment to keep at @entity29 ? you would argue not			2
the numbers – be it age , goals , fee or wages – do not make business sense			0
better , it seems , already reside within the club			0
@entity114 and @entity115 have eight goals apiece this term , while playmakers @entity118 and @entity120 have also outscored @entity1			2
then there is @entity122 , the academy product who broke all manner of scoring records at youth level and is nine years @entity1 ’s junior			0
@entity122 has broken all manner of scoring records at youth level and has impressed for the first - team the beauty of the loan agreement is that it serves as a ‘ try before you buy ’ scenario for @entity22			0
thus far , he has struggled for form and fitness , never a favourable combination			0
he has five months to persuade his manager and the paymasters at the club that he is worth such a monstrous outlay			0
for supporters – those of @entity22 and perhaps even beyond – there is the hope that @entity1 will come good , that he will unleash that devastating streak which did for @entity3 two years ago and won him so many admirers in this land			1
that following , however , is fading fast , as are his chances of remaining at @entity22 .			0

@entity1 has struggled at @entity22 having returned to full fitness after serious injury
the striker injured his cruciate ligament for @entity45 last season
