by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:12 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 25 october 2013 @entity4 ’s ageing population is more to blame for the nation ’s housing crisis than the influx of immigrants , the government has claimed			1
@entity10 minister @entity9 said the rise of great - grandparents meant more homes were needed to accommodate more generations of families who do not want to live together			1
he said that two thirds of growth in population was ‘ not from immigration but from ageing ’			1
pressure : @entity4 's ageing population is responsible for the bulk of housing demand because different generations of families do not want to live together , the government claimed the planning minister 's claim came as @entity10 @entity29 staged a revolt against plans to build thousands of homes on the @entity33 , saying it would lead to ‘ planning anarchy ’ and lose them votes at the next election			1
angry backbenchers criticised planning minister @entity9 for forcing a major building programme on councils to meet a chronic housing shortage			1
but he said they had to respond to a housing crisis caused by an ageing population and uncontrolled immigration under the last @entity45 government			1
mr @entity9 conceded that one source of population growth was immigration ‘ which was uncontrolled for a long time ’			1
warning : planning minister @entity9 said the population has grown , and @entity4 has not built enough houses to keep pace he went on : ‘ we as a party rightly criticised that , and are now doing something to control it			1
‘ however , it is important to remember that the majority — about two thirds — of the growth in population and in the number of households in the country has resulted not from immigration but from ageing			2
‘ one way that i ask people to think about it is by considering how many people now are part of families in which four generations are alive			2
‘ quite a lot of them are			0
it used to be rare to have a great - grandparent or great - grandchild in a family ; it is now common , because people are living longer , and they do not all want to live in the same house			0
’ last year , mr @entity9 told councils to find the land to build 270,000 homes by 2018			2
he has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of @entity86 must be built on to solve the crisis			1
yesterday he told mps it was better to build on former industrial land , but this could only be used for 70 per cent of the homes needed , adding : ‘ our population has grown , and we have not built enough houses to keep pace			2
he was backed by @entity10 mp @entity97 who said that ‘ not all , or even nearly all ’ of increased demand for homes is about immigration			0
‘ if we strip out future net migration , the projected requirement is still 149,000 : people are living longer ; households are smaller , for all sorts of wider social reasons ; kids live away at university and have a place at home ; hardly anyone has a lodger anymore ; and so on , ’ mr @entity97 said			0
‘ there are lots of pressures , and they will not go away			0
’ meanwhile backbenchers said ministers had promised that they could decide where to build homes and draw up local plans			0
but they claimed developers were being allowed to ride roughshod over the wishes of local planners and foist housing developments on unsuitable areas			0
under threat : mr @entity9 has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of @entity86 must be built on to solve the crisis former planning minister sir @entity131 said four developments proposed in his @entity134 constituency were refused by the council , only to be given the green light by local government secretary @entity137			1
sir @entity131 said the decisions ‘ rode a coach and horses though protection for the @entity33 ’ , adding : ‘ this is not a sensible planning policy , this is planning anarchy			0
’ @entity147 , mp for @entity148 , said there was no shortage of homes in his constituency , but developers planned to build 50 per cent more within 20 years			0
he added : ‘ i question the government ’s assertion that they must built so very many houses that local authorities have to designate green - belt land to meet these arbitrary and as yet undefined housing targets			2
our policies on planning are losing us many votes			0
’ former home office minister @entity164 insisted that despite government rhetoric about empowering councils , home - building was ‘ developer - led and effectively amounts to a free - for - all on our countryside ’ .			0
