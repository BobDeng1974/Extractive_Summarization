there was no roar from the engine as this super-charged sports car topped 150mph on its record - breaking run yesterday			2
only the relatively gentle sound of tyre rolling over road disturbed the peace and quiet as the @entity9 land speed record for an electric car was shattered			1
the team behind a supercar powered by energy from wind turbines believe they have smashed the @entity9 land - speed record for an electric car			1
their recorded speed of 148.7mph breaks the record of 137mph set by @entity19 , the grandson of speed ace sir @entity20 , 10 years ago			2
but today ’s achievement still needs to be ratified by the @entity36 before the record can be officially declared			2
the makers of the @entity22 say it is the first electric supercar to be built in the @entity9 and they hope it will ' smash the stereotype ' of electric - powered cars as boring and slow			1
it is the brainchild of @entity26 , founder of green electricity company @entity27 , of @entity44 , @entity45			2
now called ' the @entity22 ' , the car was originally a second - hand @entity47 which was bought on @entity49 for £ 10,000			0
another £ 750,000 was spent modifying the car over a two - and - a - half year period with the aim of changing the image of electric vehicles			1
stereotype smash : the team home the @entity22 will put paid to the stereotype that electric cars are ' boring ' powered by battery using electricity from wind turbines , the car averaged 151 mph over two runs of the one mile course			1
mr @entity26 has said : ' we built the @entity22 to smash the stereotype of electric cars as something @entity69 would drive - slow , boring , not cool			1
' mr @entity26 said the @entity22 is powered entirely by electricity generated by @entity27 ’s network of 53 wind turbines around the @entity9			0
it was designed and built in less than two years by a team of leading @entity9 motorsport engineers in @entity75			1
mr @entity26 said he wanted to stimulate a debate about how everyone will move around when the world runs out of oil			1
he said the @entity22 is capable of 0 - 100mph in 8.5 seconds and , on paper , is capable of topping 200mph			0
the @entity22 can travel from 100 - 150 miles between charges , depending on driving style , and can be charged from empty in less than 30 minutes			0
mr @entity23 , who lives in @entity84 and works for an estate agency in @entity44 , has had many years of experience racing a range of cars since his early teens			1
he said the amazing thing about the car was its consistent acceleration at all speeds			0
last summer mr @entity19 attempted to break his own record but ran into trouble on the beach at @entity97 in @entity98			0
ready to break the record : racing driver @entity23 wilth @entity26 of @entity27 , moments before the attempt at @entity31 in @entity32 mr @entity26 said the @entity22 is powered entirely by electricity generated by @entity27 's network of 53 wind turbines around the @entity9			0

*creators* want to ' smash the *sterotype* that electric cars are ' slow and boring cars that @entity69 would drive '
