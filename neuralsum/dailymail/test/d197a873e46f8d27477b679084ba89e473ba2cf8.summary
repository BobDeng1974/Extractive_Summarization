landslides have exposed trails of dinosaur footprints running along a near - vertical rock face in @entity4			1
and although the angle of the prints could suggest the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers , @entity4 ’s @entity6 paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity that forced the earth upwards			1
the attraction , at @entity14 in @entity15 , comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints - and frequent landslides reveal new ones , some of which belong to unknown species			1
@entity4 ’s @entity6 paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity , forcing earth upwards and preserving the precious trackways so that dinosaur tracks are seen on a vertical ' wall ' ( pictured ) the wall , which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world , is approximately 390 feet ( 120 metres ) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs , @entity30 reported			1
some of them are more than a metre in length , indicating the size of some of the vast beasts that roamed the area in the upper cretaceous period - a time in which the majority of dinosaurs lived			0
at first glance , it appears that large dinosaurs such as the @entity49 and armoured @entity50 hauled their considerable bulks up the incredibly steep slope , which measures one mile ( 1.5km )			0
but the imprinted rock was once horizontal before being pushed upwards by tectonic activity			1
the attraction , at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity4 ( left ) , comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints ( right ) – and frequent landslides reveal new ones , some of which belong to unknown species the wall , which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world , is approximately 390 feet ( 120 metres ) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs			1
some , like the one pictured , are large in 2009 , fossil hunters came across what are thought to be among the world 's largest dinosaur prints			1
measuring 5ft ( 1.5 metres ) wide , they were made by long - necked sauropods 150 million years ago and were found in chalky sediment in the @entity72 plateau of eastern @entity73			0
it 's thought the @entity76 dinosaurs were more than 75 ft ( 23 metres ) long and weighed up to 40 tonnes			1
palaeontologist @entity77 of @entity73 ’s @entity78 , said at the time , from the prints , ‘ we can calculate their size and speed , find out about their behaviour and learn how they got around			0
' ‘ they were very hard to see because there were a lot of little stones ( on the ground ) , there was grass growing there , and you really had to have a trained eye to notice something , ’ dr @entity77 said			0
the area was not mountainous when the dinosaurs were alive and the region had lots of water and islands , meaning the tracks were preserved by the sea and sediment			0
this activity thrust a huge slab of earth upwards , which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face			1
however , the site looked very different millions of years ago , when the region was muddy and flat			0
the dinosaurs left their mark while walking along the shoreline of a large lake			0
there are layers of prints preserved in the limestone because the marks hardened in dry periods , before being covered in preservative mud , enabling the process to start again			2
paleontologist @entity127 also suggested that a huge volcanic eruption threw millions of cubic metres of ash into space 68 million years ago , which gradually covered the prints to protect them , @entity126 reported			0
a decade after the discovery , which was made by miners in the mid 1980s , palaeontologists began to document the prints			2
due to the spacing of these prints , experts can use them to reveal clues about the dinosaurs ’ gait , build and lifestyle			2
one set of tracks , for example , revealed two lines of prints with a smaller pair , suggesting a baby walked alongside its parents , while another set , now known as @entity150 , was made by a baby @entity151			1
when some are removed , or crumble away , more are revealed underneath			0
while there may be more precious footprints yet to be found , some experts say @entity156 , which means ‘ lime hill ’ in the @entity160 tongue , is under threat from human activity			2
the imprinted rock was pushed upwards by tectonic activity , thrusting a huge slab of earth upwards , which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face ( pictured ) at first glance , it appears that large dinosaurs ( such as the one pictured ) as well as @entity49 and armoured @entity50 , hauled their considerable bulks up the incredibly steep slope the site , at @entity14 in @entity15 ( shown on the map ) attracts 120,000 tourists every year , which some believe is a threat to the site , as well as a nearby cement works that uses limestone the dinosaurs left their mark ( pictured ) while walking along the shoreline of a large lake			1
their tracks dried in the hot season and were preserved before more mud and possibly volcanic ash covered and preserved them the site attracts 120,000 tourists every year , while a nearby cement factory pulls limestone from a local quarry			2
‘ the cliff has been quite affected by the many years of extracting the raw material , ’ @entity198 , administrator of @entity199 which protects the fossil filed , told @entity202			0
but she has been branded an alarmist			0

here , a volcanic rock containing a print is on display at the @entity4 park			0

there are 462 trails of 5,055 prints on a vertical limestone slab in @entity4
@entity236 was pushed upwards by tectonic movement , *standing* 390 feet tall
site 's thought to be the largest dinosaur trackway in the world and *includes* footprints made by *numerous* species and baby dinosaurs such as @entity151
attraction is prone to landslide and is said to be under threat from humans
