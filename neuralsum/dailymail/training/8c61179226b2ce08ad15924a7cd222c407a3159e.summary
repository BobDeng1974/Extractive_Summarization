by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 14:51 est , 7 january 2014 @entity3 legend @entity2 made a will to distribute his £ 750 million cash , cars and property empire among his wife and two children just three years before the ski accident which has brought him to the brink of death			1
back in 2010 he admitted that he had made a will for the first time , telling a @entity16 magazine : ' yes , i have made my testament because i am a family man			1
' but it is less about @entity3 but because of the things that can happen in everyday life			1
the 45 - year - old is still in an artificial coma at a hospital in @entity46 where he remains stable but seriously ill. @entity47 said today they have noted a ‘ slight improvement ’ in his health			1
the will , he said , ' covers all those who are important to me			0
' on sunday his father @entity53 and brother @entity54 were among the close family visitors at his bedside in @entity46 's @entity57			0
concern : @entity2 's wife , @entity59 , arrives at the @entity46 hospital where her husband is being treated after sustaining a head injury during a ski accident in @entity41 @entity64 vigil : @entity2 's father @entity66 , left , and brother @entity54 arrive at @entity67 , @entity68 , on sunday where the former seven - time @entity3 champion is being treated after sustaining a head injury @entity16 media reported that a brain scan on friday troubled his medical team but he had a quiet weekend			1
today doctors confirmed @entity2 was still in a ' critical ' condition			0
' the clinical state of @entity2 is considered as stable and is being constantly monitored as he receives medical treatment , ' a statement from @entity46 's @entity57 said			0
' however , the medical team in charge of his care underlines that they continue to consider @entity2 's condition as critical			0
' speculation is mounting that @entity41 prosecutors may be preparing charges against the operators of the piste where @entity2 crashed			1
prosecution : @entity41 prosecutors may be preparing to charge the operators of the ski area in @entity42 where @entity2 was seriously injured , pictured , after hitting his head on a rock a press conference will be held on wednesday at 10am ( gmt ) in the @entity64 town of @entity97 , local prosecutor @entity94 said			1
attorney @entity98 - a specialist in the field of ski and criminal law and formerly chief judge of the @entity103 until 2010 - has been retained by the piste management			0
if any charges are laid they could pave the way for a multi-million pound lawsuit from the @entity2 family			1
the main question , according to @entity16 media , is whether the scene of the accident - full of rocks of the type that @entity2 collided with - was properly marked			1
the new focus of the investigation comes as more evidence emerges to suggest speed was not a primary factor in the accident			0
a @entity16 man , who was filming his girlfriend in the ski resort of @entity42 , has come forward to say he inadvertently filmed @entity2 's crash on the slopes - and the footage shows the motoracing star was travelling at little more than 12mph			1
@entity2 was travelling at 12mph when he crashed , a witness claimed detectives in @entity41 were last night trying to get a copy of the smartphone video after the man , who has not been named , went to @entity16 news journal @entity134			1
@entity3 legend @entity2 , who is still in a critical condition in an induced coma , was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow			2
@entity134 said : ‘ the man , a 35 - year - old flight attendant from @entity142 , was just a few metres from the accident site on the slopes and was filming his girlfriend			0
‘ in the background of the film , slightly blurred , a skier can be seen in the unprepared part between the two slopes sliding over the snow			0
‘ according to the man , who contacted @entity134 on friday , the skier was @entity2			2
he is believed to have slowed down to a speed of up to 20kph			0
’ police will tomorrow check footage from a tiny digital camera @entity2 wore on his helmet , after his family handed it over			2
the statement corroborates claims made by @entity2 ’s spokeswoman @entity163			2
earlier this week she denied @entity2 had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 60km/h			2
she said : ' i think after having spoken with several people who have been with @entity2 at this moment , @entity2 and the group have been skiing on slopes that were normal slopes			0
' then there is a blue slope and a red slope , and in between there was a part which was deep snow , and @entity2 went into that			0
