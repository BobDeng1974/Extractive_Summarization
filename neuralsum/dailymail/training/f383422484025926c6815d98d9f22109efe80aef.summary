@entity27 will spearhead @entity2 's @entity1 charge @entity24 @entity1 record : ( @entity33 ) : 3 - 2 - 1 he ’s very @entity48 , is n’t he ? very efficient and like a machine when he ’s on a roll			1
if he gets close to how he played in winning the @entity54 it ’s bad news for the @entity7			1
he blew everyone ’s mind that week			2
@entity21 @entity1 record : ( @entity33 ) : 3 - 2 - 1 i guess it ’s because he ’s chairman of our @entity62 , but i always think of him as the headmaster			1
is it okay if i call him the old warrior ? big @entity69 fan but we wo n’t hold that against him			2
@entity71 's @entity21 will act as @entity2 's ' headmaster ' @entity17 @entity1 record : debut			1
here ’s something you did n’t know about our mystery @entity78			0
he ’s a huge petrolhead like myself			0
i like him a lot and i ’ve got high hopes for him this week			0
he ’s fearless , just like all the best @entity84			0
@entity30 @entity1 record : ( @entity33 ) : 16 - 8 - 4 is n’t it fabulous to see the old @entity30 back among us this year ? finally settled off the course , and i ’ve a feeling he ’s going to deliver big time this week			1
loves the @entity1 with a @entity0 - like passion			1
@entity30 is back to his best in time for the @entity1 @entity23 @entity1 record ( @entity33 ) : 6 - 3 - 0 my oldest mate on tour			1
vulnerable in the past but fulfilled all his potential now and i ca n’t see it ever going away like it did once			0
i do n’t think it ’s giving away any secrets to say i expect to partner him at some stage			0
@entity18 @entity1 record : debut			2
looks to me like his game changed completely after winning against a high - class field in @entity107 in january last year			0
from that point he became so strong and consistent			0
welcome to the club , @entity111			0
@entity18 is making his @entity1 debut at @entity13 @entity26 @entity1 record : ( @entity33 ) : 2 - 3 - 2 it ’s a good job it ’s not an arm - wrestling contest because the @entity7 would have no chance against this man : 6ft 4in , 220lb of pure muscle — man , he is seriously strong			1
a funny guy , too			0
@entity29 @entity1 record : ( @entity33 ) : 5 - 5 - 2 we ’ve seen it in majors and in @entity124 — @entity125 personifies guts			2
and , boy , can he putt			0
you could pile 11 men on his back and he would warrior through it , he ’s that type of guy			2
@entity29 personifies guts , according to @entity0 @entity16 @entity1 record : ( @entity33 ) : 18 - 13 - 6 nine @entity124 and 40 - odd wins around the world ? are you serious ? i tell you , all those people who throw the major thing at him because he has n’t won one have n’t a clue what they are talking about			1
@entity22 @entity1 record : debut			2
what a special week for him			0
his play in the qualifying process was so impressive he fully deserved his wildcard			0
he ’s got a great record around @entity13 as well			2
do you think the home support for him might be quite impressive ? @entity0 @entity1 record ( @entity33 ) : 12 - 3 - 0 he ’s been beyond useless all season but look at that @entity1 record			1
i can promise you this : he ’s pumped , he ’s ready and the postman is keen and eager to make another delivery			0
@entity0 was part of the @entity1 side who performed the ' @entity5 ' in 2012 @entity0 insists he 's ready to deliver the goods to help @entity2 to another victory			1
