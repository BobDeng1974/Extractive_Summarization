@entity0 is pressing on with his controversial cap rents , despite warnings from experts that plans will backfire @entity8 's plans to impose rent controls are ‘ economically illiterate ’ and will slash investment in new housing , leading to more tenants being evicted by their landlords , experts warned last night			1
@entity0 yesterday confirmed he would press on with controversial plans to cap rents despite warnings from housing experts , business and even @entity8 figures that they will backfire			1
he said rent controls – demanded by the militant unite union that bankrolls @entity8 – would give millions of ‘ forgotten ’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so - called @entity23 by soaring house prices			1
but the @entity23 campaign group said his plans were ‘ riddled with loopholes ’ and may make tenants ’ lives worse			1
under the proposals , landlords would have to offer three - year tenancies and would be banned from raising rent above inflation during this time			1
@entity34 , director of @entity23 , said long tenancies were welcome but the proposal would give landlords an incentive to evict their tenants and would not keep rent down , adding : ‘ this is because they have no plans to limit rent rises between tenancies – or after your first three years are up			1
‘ worse than this , @entity8 ’s planning new ways for landlords to evict you within that period , for example to sell your home or get it back for other reasons			1
these loopholes are scary when you think they ’re attached to a big financial incentive to use them – because that ’s the only way they will be able to put rent up in the first three years			1
’ in another loophole , hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy - to - let investors could be excluded altogether			0
most buy - to - let mortgages specify maximum tenancies of one year			0
labour sources said these landlords would be able to offer short tenancies ‘ where contractually obliged ’			0
@entity67 called the proposal ‘ drivel ’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up			1
chancellor @entity72 described the plan as a ‘ totally economically - illiterate statement that grabs headlines , but is dismissed by every expert who looks at it ’			2
the @entity78 said the way to tackle the housing crisis was to build more homes , and warned the plans could discourage investment , thereby forcing up rents in the long term			1
the @entity8 leader said rent controls – demanded by the militant unite union that bankrolls @entity8 – would give millions of ‘ forgotten ’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so - called @entity23 @entity67 called the proposal ‘ drivel ’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up			1
pictured : mr @entity0 and @entity93 on the @entity94 show today some senior @entity8 figures also have concerns , with former minister @entity97 warning against a cap last week , saying : ‘ before taking a step like that you have to be clear it does n’t have unintended consequences			1
’ yesterday , however , she insisted she supported the plan			2
housing spokesman @entity104 was forced on the back foot yesterday after footage emerged of her in 2013 saying : ‘ i do n’t think rent controls are going to work in practice			1
’ yesterday , she said she meant ‘ @entity110 - style controls ’ and said @entity8 ’s plan was different			1
rent controls were widely blamed for a reduction in rented housing in @entity114 and @entity115 in the @entity110 as investment dried up			2
the bad old days : a @entity118 slum rent controls have already proved a disaster in @entity114 after they were introduced in the @entity121			2
the measure was supposed to be temporary – but was only dismantled by @entity123 in the @entity124			0
during this time the private rented sector collapsed from 90 per cent of the country ’s housing stock to less than 10 per cent			2
by the @entity110 , rent controls were widely blamed for the slum conditions in much of @entity114 ’s remaining private rented stock			0
landlords , unable to make a sustainable return , neglected homes and dragged their feet over the most basic repairs			0
unscrupulous operators such as @entity137 , whose name became a byword for exploitation , drove out tenants who had legal rent protection to replace them with others who were not covered by the law			0
@entity146 ’s favourite economist @entity145 , a @entity148 prize - winner , has warned that attempts to control rent always fail , writing : ‘ almost every freshman - level textbook contains a case study on rent control , using its known adverse side - effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand			2
’ the socialist @entity159 economist @entity158 once said : ‘ next to bombing , rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique for destroying cities			0
’ @entity165 , of the @entity166 , warned that rent controls could result in a return to the ugly conditions of the past , adding they ‘ would lessen investment in new homes when we need more and serve only to paper over cracks in the market ’			2
he said : ‘ for some , it is easier to achieve a cheap political point by calling for rent controls than provide a prescription for growth in the private rented sector			0
ultimately , tenants would lose as they find themselves forced into slums rented by @entity137 landlords operating outside the legal market			0
’ @entity186 , of the @entity187 , said rent controls led to a fall in supply and the standard of homes because ‘ landlords do not have the money to invest in ongoing maintenance ’			0
@entity195 , of the @entity197 think - tank , said rent controls were ‘ a stunningly bad idea that could clobber renters ’			0
he said they would give landlords a huge incentive to raise rents at the start of a tenancy , adding : ‘ @entity8 has unwittingly announced a policy that could devastate cities and exacerbate the housing crisis			1
’ the @entity209 said the proposal ‘ would result in higher rents , a reduction in the quality of rented property and in the supply of homes to rent without improving affordability ’			1
@entity219 's political balancing act she has spent the whole election campaign tilting to the left			2
but yesterday @entity222 was trying her best to stick to the centre – even leaning to the right at times			0
balancing act : @entity222 was trying her best to stick to the centre – even leaning to the right at times the @entity229 first minister went to an election campaign event at the @entity231 , @entity232 however , it was not political gymnastics being performed by the @entity236 leader			0
instead she was joining youngsters on the beam and parallel bars during a visit to a gym in @entity232 , @entity229			0
miss @entity222 was launching her party ’s youth manifesto , joined by actor @entity245 , the star of police drama @entity246			0
@entity245 said @entity229 nationalist mps would ensure the voices of @entity229 ’s youth were heard .			0
