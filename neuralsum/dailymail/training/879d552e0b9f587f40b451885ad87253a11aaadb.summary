by @entity0 fears were growing last night that a passenger jet which vanished from the sky with 239 people on board was the target of a terrorist attack			0
the @entity11 @entity10 777 - 200 was brought down by a ‘ sudden , catastrophic event ’ with no time for a @entity14 call , a senior aviation source in @entity9 told @entity15			1
two of the passengers appeared to be travelling on stolen passports			2
panic : relatives of passengers on board the @entity11 @entity10 which was brought down by a ' sudden , catastrophic event ' with no time for a @entity14 call there were suspicions that yesterday ’s incident marked a new escalation in the terror campaign by separatist @entity30 , who want their region of @entity33 in western @entity34 to have greater autonomy from the @entity34 government			1
the majority of passengers on the flight from @entity40 to @entity34 were @entity34 , with 13 other nationalities represented			1
the plane vanished from radar screens off the coast of southern @entity45 early yesterday , sparking a huge air and sea search			0
two large oil slicks were reportedly seen in the @entity49 late yesterday near the spot where flight mh370 is believed to have plunged into the water two hours into its journey from the @entity40 capital			1
the search was due to resume at first light today			0
speaking in @entity9 , a senior civil aviation source told @entity15 it was ‘ incomprehensible ’ that the plane , which has an outstanding safety record , would have disappeared without warning			1
‘ even if both engines failed , there would have been time for a @entity14 call , ’ the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity			1
‘ there was obviously a sudden , catastrophic event that brought this plane out of the sky			1
there could have been an explosion and we ca n’t rule out sabotage or an act of terrorism			0
‘ that the pilots were unable to send a distress signal lends credence to this theory			0
‘ if it were an engine failure , bad weather or air turbulence , the pilots would have had time to put out an emergency call			2
‘ that ’s why the possibility of an explosive or hijacker on @entity94 can not be discounted			0
’ the majority of passengers on the flight from @entity40 to @entity34 were @entity34 , with 13 other nationalities represented a second civil aviation source confirmed the belief that terrorism or sabotage was thought to be behind the disaster and said members of the plane ’s maintenance crew were having their backgrounds examined			1
international experts added further weight to the terrorism theory			0
in the @entity115 , @entity111 , operations and safety editor at aviation website @entity114 , said it was ‘ extraordinary ’ that the pilots did not make a distress call			0
they would have had ‘ plenty of time ’ to report any technical problems , mr @entity111 said , adding : ‘ something happened and the pilots did not tell anyone			0
why ? ’ @entity10 777s are regarded as among the world ’s safest aircraft with only one fatal passenger accident – a crash - landing which killed three people in @entity132 last year – in nearly 20 years of service			1
fears that a terror attack caused the disaster were heightened when a list of passengers released by @entity140 police reportedly had two names pixellated out , leading to online speculation they might have been ethnic @entity30			2
later , it emerged that two passengers were travelling on stolen passports belonging to nationals from @entity147 and @entity148			0
asked whether terrorism was suspected , @entity40 transport minister @entity149 said authorities had ‘ no information , but we are looking at all possibilities ’			2
@entity30 have been behind increasingly brazen attacks on @entity34 including a car bomb atrocity in @entity140 ’s @entity156 last october that killed five people and injured dozens more			1
a mass stabbing at a railway station in the southern @entity34 town of @entity161 on march 1 that left 28 people dead and 113 injured is also believed to have been linked to unrest in @entity33 .			2
