for the first time , ethnic minorities make up a majority of babies in the @entity4 ethnic minorities now make up the majority of babies in the @entity4 , official figures revealed today			1
it is the first time that this has been the case and the change reflects a growing age divide between mostly white , older @entity4 and predominantly minority youths that could reshape government policies			1
preliminary census estimates also show the share of @entity16 households headed by women - made up of mostly single mothers - now exceeds @entity16 households with married couples , a sign of declining @entity4 marriages overall but also continuing challenges for black youths without involved fathers			1
the findings , based on the latest government data , offer a preview of final 2010 census results being released this summer that provide detailed breakdowns by age , race and householder relationships such as same - sex couples			2
demographers say the numbers provide the clearest confirmation yet of a changing social order , one in which racial and ethnic minorities will become the @entity4 majority by the middle of the century			2
currently , non-hispanic whites make up just under half of all three - year - olds , which is the youngest age group shown in the @entity49 's october 2009 annual survey , its most recent			1
in 1990 , more than 60 per cent of children in that age group were white			1
youngest states by median age @entity63 of @entity64 @entity65 35.9 oldest states by median age @entity69 @entity68 39.8 after taking into account a larger - than - expected jump in the minority child population in the 2010 census , the share of white babies falls below 50 per cent			2
by contrast , whites make up the vast majority of older @entity4 - 80 per cent of the over 65s and roughly 73 per cent of people aged 45 - 64			1
@entity81 , a sociology professor and senior demographer at the @entity83 , noted that much of the race change is being driven by increases in younger @entity87 women having more children than white women , who have lower birth rates and as a group are moving beyond their prime childbearing years			1
the numbers come amid public debate over hotly contested federal and state issues , from immigration and gay marriage to the rising cost of government benefits , that are resonating in different ways by region and demographics			0
@entity104 became the latest state this month to pass a wide - ranging anti-immigration law , which in part requires schools to report students ' immigration status to state authorities			0
age divide : the chart shows how the median age differs vastly in @entity4 , from @entity69 , where it 's 42.7 , to @entity63 , where it is just 33.8			0
12 of the 14 states with a median age of less than 36 are in the @entity119 and @entity120 that follows tough immigration measures passed in similarly @entity124 - leaning states such as @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			0
but governors in @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 , which long have been home to numerous immigrants , have opted out of the federal @entity135 programme that aims to deport dangerous criminals , saying it has made illegal immigrants afraid of reporting crimes to police			0
@entity141 may soon opt out as well			0
while the number of black single mothers has been gradually declining , overall marriages among blacks are decreasing faster			0
that reflects a broader @entity4 trend of declining marriage rates as well as increases in non-family households made up of people living alone , or with unmarried partners or other non-relatives			0
female - headed households make up a 19 per cent share among @entity87 and 9 per cent each for whites and @entity157			1
meanwhile , figures released last month revealed that the migration of young @entity87 families has fuelled the age divide between regions of @entity4			1
young hispanic migrant families are increasingly moving into western and southern states , while older baby boomers stay put further north			0
the population in the @entity119 and @entity167 is now dramatically younger than in the @entity168 , and there is a gap of 3.9 years between the youngest and oldest regions of the country , according to figures released by the @entity49			2
in all , 12 of the 14 states with median ages of 36 or younger are located in the @entity119 and @entity167 , including @entity141 , @entity176 and @entity125 , whereas 13 of the 20 states with a median age of 38 or higher are in the @entity179 and @entity168 , including @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182			2
talented arrivals : college - educated immigrants now outnumber those entering the country with just a high school degree - and the variation is much bigger in urban areas , a report by the @entity185 says younger people are increasingly leaving these areas - particularly industrial cities in the @entity179 like @entity196 which have been badly affected by the recession - to find work in the @entity199			2
but ageing is being slowed in the @entity119 and @entity167 , as young @entity87 migrants settle and have families , while others continue to move in			1
another intriguing recent study has revealed that college - educated immigrants now outnumber those entering the country with just a high school degree - and the variation is much bigger in urban areas			0
@entity119 rises : in many @entity119 states , the @entity87 population has doubled on ten years ago , with hispanics outstripping whites for the first time in @entity215 - 46 to 40 per cent they outnumber those educated at high school by 25 per cent in 44 major @entity16 cities - and 30 per cent of working - age immigrants now have a college degree , compared to 19 per cent in 1980			1
an increase in demand from @entity4 employers has seen more college - educated immigrants arriving in the @entity4 over the past decade than immigrants without high school education , reported @entity229			0
only 28 per cent of @entity4 immigrants are without a high school diploma and half of skilled immigrants are overqualified for their jobs , a report by the @entity185 in @entity231 said			0
where we are : an @entity16 drift away from the @entity179 has coincided with a huge growth of @entity87 in the @entity167 @entity4 's tomorrow : a demographic change by decade @entity4 's tomorrow from @entity243 on @entity244 .			1

race change driven by younger @entity87 women having more children than white women
whites still make up 80 *%* of over 65s
