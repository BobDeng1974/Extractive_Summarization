by @entity0 we 're a nation of hoarders , but @entity4 might inspire you to take a closer look at your clutter			1
his tv show salvage hunters proves that junk can be priceless - if it has the ' @entity11 '			1
@entity4 , 43 , is no ordinary antiques trader			1
he describes himself as a ' decorative salvage dealer ' , scouring collections and hoards everywhere from country houses to bric - a - brac shops , in search of things to renovate			2
he has an eye for the pieces other dealers miss , and his discerning clients - who include fashion designer @entity23 , chef @entity24 and @entity26 star @entity25 - trust his taste in the unusual			2
@entity4 on the hunt for hidden treasures a typical @entity4 find might be a rusty arc lamp or a vintage barber 's shop chair ... or even part of a building , such as a gargoyle			1
he got his eye for art from his father , a painter who taught him about perspective , scale and form			2
' i still ca n't paint , ' he admits with a laugh , ' but i can look at something and know at a glance whether it 's right or wrong			2
' he insists he never overthinks what to buy			2
' it 's very organic , i just let it happen , ' he says			2
at 15 he set out on a lifelong treasure hunt , learning how to find buyers and turn a profit			2
he and his wife @entity53 now sell all over the world from their warehouse in @entity57 , @entity58 , and in january they opened a stand at the @entity62 department store on @entity63 in @entity64			0
' this is the best job in the world			0
i get to wander round beautiful buildings , and buy something wonderful			1
i own it for a brief space of time and then i make my living out of it			1
' ' that was a fluke , ' @entity4 says			1
' the head buyer of @entity62 called into my warehouse when he was on holiday			0
he did n't even know i had a tv show ! ' most antiques traders are well aware of @entity4 's television fame - this week sees the start of the show 's fourth series - and that creates its own problems			1
' i do n't mind getting recognised , and it does n't really push the prices up - in fact , some people want to strike a deal just because they love the show			0
but i do end up with things i sometimes did n't intend to buy , because so many youngsters approach me with their discoveries			0
they 've found something unusual , and i want to encourage their passion for antiques , so we end up haggling and i end up paying			0
that 's ok , because it 's helping to shape the next generation of salvage hunters			0
' the new series sees @entity4 uncover an @entity105 's cave above a @entity107 pub , where the landlord has been collecting oddities for 50 years			1
' i 'm a hoarder , ' confesses @entity110 , 77 , who runs the @entity111			1
' it goes back to the war - you did n't throw anything away			0
' the rooms upstairs , which once might have been let by the night to travellers , are now over-stuffed museums packed with the unexpected ... such as a 19th - century three - cornered hat with ostrich plumes , and a velveteen dress uniform that would not have looked out of place on the cover of @entity126 ' @entity125 album			0
@entity4 's celebrity clients include fashion designer @entity23 ( left ) and chef @entity24 ( right ) but @entity4 's eye picks out an oak box that contains a bizarre @entity131 apparatus for delivering electric shocks to treat psychiatric illnesses			1
it 's just the sort of puzzling contraption , all cables and dials with brass levers , that might turn up in any junk shop with a £ 5 tag ... but the right buyer might pay a hundred times that			1
that nose for a bargain uncovers all sorts of unlikely gems			0
in a barn on the grounds of a @entity148 manor house in @entity149 , @entity4 sees a battered armchair lying upside down			1
its stuffing is slashed and two legs have snapped off - most people would take one look and sling it on a bonfire , but @entity4 pays £ 150			1
even his wife thinks he 's taken leave of his senses , until it emerges from his renovation workshop with all four legs			0
suddenly , the chair is a classic , and worth an estimated £ 550			0
he has to be quick off the mark to find the best pieces , and be prepared to go wherever the treasure is hidden			0
' last week i got an email from a friend about a mill in @entity173 , with some photos of carts made out of pony skins - huge square things , with massive cast iron wheels , 160 years old			0
we were there next morning and bought 16			0
you 've got to get in the car , know what they 're worth to you and have the money ready			0
the only downside is the amount of driving - it 's often five hours on the road			0
' on a visit to @entity191 , who runs what some say is @entity195 's best junk shop in @entity196 upon @entity197 , @entity4 falls in love with a chair from a traditional barber 's shop			1
it 's child - sized and decorated with a metal horse 's head to keep young customers amused while they were getting a short back and sides			0
@entity191 is reluctant to part with it , but @entity4 knows that many visitors to his stand at @entity62 would happily pay £ 1,500 to buy it for their own young family			1
a deal is soon sealed			0
' i 'm so lucky , ' @entity4 enthuses			1
' this is the best job in the world			0
i get to wander round beautiful buildings , see antique collections that are like time capsules , and buy something wonderful			1
i own it for a brief space of time and then i make my living out of it			2
' so next time you think of clearing out your attic , just remember - one man 's junkyard is another man 's fortune			2
