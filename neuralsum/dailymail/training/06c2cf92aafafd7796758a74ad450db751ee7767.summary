by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 20:08 est , 29 march 2012 jailed : @entity1 , 20 , maintained his sleepwalking defence for two - and - a - half years before finally admitting he raped the girl at a @entity5 holiday resort in 2009 a rapist who claimed he was sleepwalking when he carried out a sex attack was finally jailed yesterday after admitting his defence was untrue			1
@entity1 , 20 , had maintained for two - and - a - half years that he had no recollection of raping a fellow holidaymaker in @entity5 in 2009			1
he finally changed his plea to guilty after psychologist dr @entity12 , a @entity13 expert in sleep - related disorders brought in to examine the evidence and interview @entity1 , concluded his amnesia was down to the effects of excessive drinking and not sleepwalking			1
it is thought to be the first time a sleepwalking defence has been successfully challenged in a sex case dealt with by @entity24 courts			1
in several cases , juries have cleared a defendant on the basis that he was sleepwalking ( see panel below )			2
jailing @entity1 for six years yesterday , judge @entity30 said his crime had a devastating effect on the victim , who was 17 at the time of the attack			1
‘ she said “ i did nothing wrong ” , and she was absolutely right , ’ added the judge			0
‘ i only hope today will mark an occasion when she can go back to being the happy young girl she used to be			0
’ @entity43 heard @entity1 attacked the girl in the early hours of a september morning after they had been drinking in the @entity46 town of @entity47 , where they were on holiday			2
the victim , now 19 , flew home the next day and reported the attack to her local police			2
@entity1 , 18 at the time , handed himself in to police at his local station in @entity57 , @entity58 , when he returned to the @entity24			2
he claimed the pair had been drinking and were both ‘ wobbly ’ and he ‘ could n’t remember ’ what had happened			0
he did not deny committing the act , but refused to take criminal responsibility because he said he was sleepwalking and had no memory of what had happened			0
@entity65 , who agreed with their counterparts in @entity5 that they would lead the investigation because both victim and suspect were back in the @entity24 , spent months seeking expert advice about @entity1 ’s sleepwalking defence			1
the @entity73 eventually put lead investigator @entity74 in touch with dr @entity12 at the @entity77 in @entity78			0
holiday from hell : prosecutor @entity80 said @entity1 raped the girl while they were both on holiday in @entity47 , @entity5 on september 12 , 2009 guilty : @entity1 finally pleaded guilty to the rape at a hearing at @entity43 earlier this month after maintaining he had been sleepwalking and then ' insane ' when he carried out the act he found @entity1 ’s behaviour was not consistent with that normally displayed by sleepwalkers , and concluded his memory loss was likely to have been the result of excessive alcohol consumption			1
@entity1 withdrew the sleepwalking defence , but then claimed he was insane at the time of the attack			1
he finally pleaded guilty earlier this month after a psychiatrist rejected his claim of insanity			0
he was placed on the sex offenders register for life			0
the court heard the victim , who was present to see him jailed , was on anti-depressants and had put her ambition to become a midwife on hold			0
after the hearing , she and her family said in a statement that while they had often felt like dropping the case through frustration and exhaustion , ‘ we knew there was no other option if we were to achieve justice and prevent the same thing from happening to someone else in the future ’			0
@entity122 said : ‘ we hope this conviction sends out the message that sleepwalking can no longer be a safe defence in cases of rape			2

@entity1 finally withdrew the sleepwalking defence after it was successfully challenged
victim and her family said the past two - and - a - half years had been ' exhausting and *emotionally* *draining* for us all '
