by @entity1 reporter cancer patients could be given a tailor - made series of drugs to hugely boost their survival chances , experts say cancer patients could be given a tailor - made series of drugs to hugely boost their survival chances within the next two years , experts claim			1
patients with the deadliest types of the disease would be given individual ‘ lists ’ of drugs depending on the type of tumour			1
scientists from @entity18 claim it will revolutionise the way the disease is treated and extend average survival rates for some types of cancer from four months to many years			1
an initial trial will involve patients with lung cancer – the commonest but one of the most deadliest forms , claiming 35,000 lives in @entity31 a year			1
if it is a success , patients with breast , prostate and bowel cancer could also be given the treatment within the next two years			1
over the next few months 300 patients with advanced lung cancer will be recruited to take part in the trial , which is being carried out at 18 hospitals in the @entity31			1
researchers will first carry out tests to determine the genetic make - up of each tumour in order to work out the types of drugs to be given			1
scientists hope it will give patients who are only expected to survive for four months the chance to live for many years			0
despite recent advancements in cancer treatment , the survival chances for certain types such as lung remain tragically low			2
around 43,500 @entity31 are diagnosed with lung cancer annually – just ten per cent of which live beyond five years			2
dr @entity61 , chief executive of @entity18 , said if the trial was successful , patients with breast , prostate and bowel cancer could be given the bespoke series of drugs within two years			1
‘ we are giving a number of options to patients who would otherwise have exhausted all their treatment , ’ he said			0
‘ we are talking about the potential for thousands of patients to get another option			0
‘ i really believe that what we are doing is going to rewrite the rule book on how we do clinical trials			0
scientists from @entity18 say the new treatment plans could be available within two years ‘ it shifts the emphasis on designing a trial around a specific drug to designing a trial around a range of drugs for a specific patient			2
‘ so it ’s much more patient - centric in its approach			0
‘ if it ’s as successful as we expect it will be , we will fully then expect to roll it out to other types of cancer thereafter			0
’ the trial will be jointly run with the drug firms @entity102 and @entity103 , which are providing the treatments			0
recent figures from @entity18 show the number of @entity31 diagnosed with cancer annually has soared by almost 50,000 in a decade			2
some 330,000 cases were diagnosed in 2011 , up from 283,000 in 2001			0
the number included 50,000 with breast cancer , 40,695 with bowel cancer , 40,975 with prostate cancer , 42,026 with lung cancer and 12,818 with skin cancer			1
experts have blamed the rise on an ageing population , as well as obesity and alcohol consumption , which can trigger the disease			0
health secretary @entity121 said : ‘ by investing £ 11.5million a day into research and development for the life sciences we have made this country one of the best places in the world to carry out and invest in clinical trials , which has made ground - breaking programmes like this possible			0

patients to be given individual ' lists ' of drugs depending on their tumour
@entity18 say plans will extend average survival rates
initial trial will involve 300 patients with lung cancer from 18 hospitals
researchers will start by *assessing* the genetic make - up of each tumour
if successful patients with breast , prostate and bowel cancer could *benefit* from the ' bespoke drugs service ' within the next two years
