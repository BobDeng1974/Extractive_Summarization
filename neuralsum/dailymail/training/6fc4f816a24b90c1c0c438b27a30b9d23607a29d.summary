by @entity0 emergency legislation will today be announced at @entity2 to allow @entity4 ’s spies to access data about the public ’s phone calls , texts and internet use			1
the laws will be rushed through @entity11 amid mounting concern about the threat posed to the @entity4 by jihadists returning from fighting in @entity15			2
ministers and security officials have also voiced public fears about the damage caused by @entity20 – the fugitive @entity22 official who stole and leaked top secret documents on @entity25 intelligence gathering to the @entity27 newspaper			1
the laws are intended to protect the ' capability ' which the likes of @entity25 , @entity30 and @entity31 are on the brink of losing the law will force mobile phone and internet companies to store information relating to all recent telephone calls , emails and internet searches , so they can be accessed by security officials			1
there are long - standing @entity45 tensions over the issue of communications data			0
but officials insist the legislation is not intended to give the security services and police any new powers			2
rather , it is intended to protect the ‘ capability ’ which the likes of @entity25 , @entity30 and @entity31 are on the brink of losing			1
under an @entity56 directive passed in the wake of the july 7 attacks , telephone and internet companies have been obliged to store details such as who a person calls , where from and for how long for a period of 18 months			1
it has proved crucial in smashing a series of terrorist plots , as well as organised crime syndicates and paedophile groups			0
but the directive was ruled unlawful by the @entity70 in april this year – with ministers given a strict deadline to re-write @entity4 law or stop using the spy powers			2
the @entity30 headquarters in central @entity76 will be protected by the new laws it is said after weeks of negotiations between the @entity81 and conservatives , agreement has now been reached to re-instate the powers			1
this will be done by writing them directly into @entity4 law rather than relying on the now unlawful 2006 @entity56 data retention directive			2
@entity89 ministers remain adamant that further powers are needed to reflect changes in technology since 2006 - but accept this will now have to wait until after the 2015 general election			0
the @entity81 remain implacably opposed to the so - called ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ – which would have given police and spy agencies even greater powers to monitor every telephone call , email and internet search in @entity4			0
these three men all claim to have come from @entity4 and feature in an @entity106 video featuring young @entity4 jihadists encouraging @entity108 in the @entity109 to join them in @entity110 and @entity15 in a speech last month , mrs may said the security services need new surveillance powers to counter the ‘ real and deadly ’ threat from jihadists			0
she said the conflicts in @entity15 and @entity110 had created a haven for terrorists just a few hours from @entity76 by plane			0
at the same time , the internet has become a ‘ paradise ’ for terrorists and criminals who can operate out of the reach of the authorities			0
but mrs may added that the powers used to defeat @entity4 ’s enemies were not keeping up with new technology , leading to a collapse in @entity4 ’s capacity to protect its citizens			0
later this year , a report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee into the murder of the soldier @entity137 in @entity138 , southeast @entity76 , is expected to argue that - had @entity30 had greater internet surveillance powers - it could have helped to thwart the plot .			1
