she might be approaching her 89th birthday but nothing was going to stop the @entity3 from enjoying a ride in the spring sunshine this morning			1
the monarch , 88 , was spotted trotting through @entity7 aboard her faithful black fell pony , @entity8			1
joined by a groom on another of her @entity12 ponies , the @entity3 cut a relaxed figure as she enjoyed her ride but , as is her wont , eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves			1
enjoying the sunshine : the @entity3 enjoys a ride on her @entity12 pony @entity8 @entity3 , who has never worn riding helmets , has been encouraged to wear the safety hats in the past but is reportedly reluctant to wear one because of her hair			1
speaking in an interview last year , her racing trainer @entity27 recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat			0
the @entity3 is said to have replied : ' i never have and you do nâ€™t have to have your hair done like i do			0
' her majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a @entity42 pony , named @entity43 , aged four			0
since then , the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds , among them @entity48 , a black farm - bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50 's , and @entity53 , a grey gelding whom the @entity3 famously galloped down the course at @entity57 in 1961			0
equine enthusiast : her majesty adores the ponies and breeds them at @entity60 no helmet : the queen never wears a riding helmet , preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf cutting back : she has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury long term love : the @entity3 has ridden all her life and continues to breed several breeds of horse and pony recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over @entity78 on horseback			1
nevertheless , the @entity3 remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and , according to sources , is a familiar sight at her @entity7 stables			2
she is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies , some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren , notably @entity89 's children , @entity90 and @entity91 , @entity92			0
along with her thoroughbred race horses , the queen also breeds @entity12 ponies and has a stud specialising in @entity98 ponies at @entity99			1
first love : the @entity3 's first pony was a tiny @entity42 named @entity43 who was given to her at the age of four familiar sight : the @entity3 riding her much - loved horse @entity105 during @entity78 seal of approval : a fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the @entity3 at @entity60 one of the oldest equine breeds on the planet , @entity12 ponies like the @entity3 's mount @entity8 , have roamed the moors of @entity115 since the @entity117 period			1
docile , hardy and thick - set , the majority of @entity12 ponies are black , grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh			2
highly prized by the @entity124 , the @entity126 tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago , the ponies later caught the eye of the invading @entity131 and were used as trade goods all over the @entity133			0
the @entity131 also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today			0
originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall ( similar to @entity138 and @entity139 ponies ) , by the end of the @entity142 period , the average @entity12 was more than a hand higher			2
another invader to fall in love with the @entity12 pony was the @entity147 , who used the animals as pack ponies ; a use continued by the @entity152			2
by the 13th century , the @entity12 's usefulness as a pack animal was well - established and the pony played an important role in @entity158 trade until the end of the 18th century			2
following the @entity161 , @entity160 were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town , as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed			0
although previously used in trotting races , the @entity12 pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s , when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families			0
today , the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages , among them the @entity3 who breeds @entity12 ponies at her @entity60 stud			1

the queen was spotted enjoying a ride in @entity7 today
rode her favourite @entity12 , a mare named @entity8
left hard hats at home and opted for one of her favourite scarves instead
