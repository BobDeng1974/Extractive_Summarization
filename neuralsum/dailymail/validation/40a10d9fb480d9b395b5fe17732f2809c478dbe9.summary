retired commander : lord @entity1 said @entity3 espionage had soared to a ‘ worrying ’ level @entity3 has deployed a fleet of spy trawlers off the @entity8 coast to intercept military communications , one of @entity8 ’s most senior retired commanders said yesterday			1
lord @entity1 said @entity3 espionage had soared to a ‘ worrying ’ level as president @entity13 ordered more acts of ‘ provocation ’			1
equipped with hi - tech surveillance , the converted fishing boats have been seen in the international waters of the @entity19 by @entity21 aircraft			1
lord @entity1 , a former @entity22 , said the @entity24 tactic was designed to gain intelligence on @entity8 ’s nuclear missiles and warships			1
he said : ‘ it was quite a tense business during the @entity24 and now it is winding up again and it is very worrying			0
they seem to have ... increased espionage , which raises tension			0
’ lord @entity1 spoke out as @entity32 mobilised the country ’s entire @entity33 to full combat readiness			2
in a show of strength , @entity13 deployed 45,000 troops , more than 56 warships and submarines , and 110 aircraft for training across the country and into the @entity44 – dwarfing @entity21 military drills which will be held off @entity46 next month			1
lord @entity1 , a military grandee , said the five - day drills were a ‘ knee jerk ’ reaction to a similar @entity21 operation announced by prime minister @entity50 on friday			2
@entity8 and 11 other @entity21 countries will contribute to the @entity54 exercise designed to send a signal to @entity32 in the face of continued aggression – but with a force strength of less than a third			2
the operation – which was hailed by the government as one of the largest land , air , and sea training exercises run in @entity64 – will feature just 12,000 military personnel			0
defence secretary @entity66 said the exercise , involving 58 warships and submarines , 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how ‘ powerful ’ @entity21 was			0
lord @entity1 said of @entity13 ’s mobilisation : ‘ it is clearly a knee jerk reaction to the fact we are about to do that exercise … and it raises escalation			1
lord @entity1 said @entity3 espionage had soared to a ‘ worrying ’ level as president @entity13 ( pictured ) ordered more acts of ‘ provocation ’ in a show of strength , @entity13 deployed 45,000 troops , more than 56 warships and submarines , and 110 aircraft for training across the country and into the @entity44 ' their conventional forces were incapable of mobilising quickly a few years ago and that has changed			1
‘ it is all very worrying as @entity13 is very unpredictable and is not obeying the norms of international order			1
‘ @entity3 has nuclear weapons and they believe they can be used for war fighting and that is hugely dangerous and means we are just a step away from the destruction of the globe			2
’ the spook ships sent by @entity32 can intercept ‘ voice transmissions ’ up to 200 miles , with @entity105 and @entity106 understood to be two of their targets as @entity111 bombers fly close to @entity8 airspace			1
the ships , known within @entity21 as @entity114 , or @entity116 ships , eavesdrop on @entity8 air bases and alert @entity119 aircrews by secure communications so they know when the @entity122 crews from the @entity124 force are taking off			2
a senior military source said : ‘ it would appear from our intelligence that they are working in support of @entity119 bombers which have been seen off the east coast and as far south as @entity134 and simply record our reaction to these events			0
’ the spook ships sent by @entity32 can intercept ‘ voice transmissions ’ up to 200 miles , with @entity105 ( pictured ) and @entity106 understood to be two of their targets at least one vessel has been spotted off the west coast of @entity46 where @entity21 will hold their major exercise next month			0
the @entity3 tried to monitor amphibious war games in the past and will sit in international waters monitoring communications traffic			1
in the past three weeks , @entity150 spy planes from the @entity151 and @entity152 have reported six agis , adding to concerns that the @entity119 activity is part of a planned maritime and air operation against the @entity8			0
the source said : ‘ while they look like fishing vessels they are packed with @entity162 ( @entity162 ) and make no secret of their presence , all they want is to sit and test our reaction times and collate communications			0
‘ the problem is that while we managed to deal with them in the 1980s by jamming their electronic ‘ listening ’ field , they had updated their systems with much greater capability and as long as they sit in international waters we can do nothing			1
’ scrambled : a @entity122 jet seen taking off from @entity181 in @entity182 at 4.30pm , shortly before @entity3 planes were intercepted last month lord @entity1 added : ‘ they are very capable trawlers			1
there are lots of things the @entity3 want to know and they do go to try and find it out			0
‘ there is much more provocation from @entity3			2
@entity13 does like to watch what @entity21 are doing as he is worried about it and sees it as an offensive alliance			0
’ the @entity3 move is the latest in a series of military ‘ cat and mouse ’ incidents as tension with the @entity200 soars to the highest level since the @entity24 stand off in the 1980s , when @entity119 spy ships sat off the @entity8 coastline			1
@entity8 ’s decision to scrap the @entity207 maritime spy plane has left the @entity208 with little capability to monitor @entity119 maritime movements and has instead relied on @entity21 allies to help			0
the source added : ‘ the sighting of a periscope was very concerning and highlighted our lack of capability			0
‘ next month we will have support from @entity21 aircraft that will mount anti-submarine patrols as we launch a major exercise off the west coast of @entity46			0
‘ it will test our amphibious capability while the @entity208 fast jets will protect the landings and the @entity227 will mount helicopter air assaults across south west @entity46 , but we know the @entity119 spy trawlers are already sat off the north west coast			0
