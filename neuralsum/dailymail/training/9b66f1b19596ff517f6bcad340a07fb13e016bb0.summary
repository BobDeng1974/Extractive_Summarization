by @entity0 the identity of suspects arrested by the police should be publicised before they are charged , the @entity1 has ruled			1
in a hugely significant verdict , judges said the public understood that naming a person who had been arrested did not mean they were guilty			0
the judgment is a boost for freedom of information campaigners – who have been battling increasing police secrecy			0
a judge has ruled that names of suspects should be released as they are arrested and before they are charged in the wake of the @entity21 report , many forces have become reluctant to name people at the point of arrest – despite the fact that it can encourage witnesses to come forward			1
yesterday ’s ruling came in the case of a man who was arrested over allegations of child sex abuse			1
he was not subsequently charged but his identity was disclosed in open court during the trial of other men			1
newspapers notified the man that , once the trial was over , they planned to report the fact that he had been arrested , along with other details			2
he objected , saying he would be ‘ stigmatised as a suspected paedophile ’ , and applied for a privacy injunction			0
the request was rejected by mr @entity46 last year and yesterday the @entity1 upheld that decision			0
the man ’s lawyers had argued the public did not understand that suspects are ‘ innocent until proven guilty ’ and naming them breached their privacy			1
but @entity53 said the principle of open justice must be upheld			1
she said : ‘ most members of the public understand the presumption of innocence and are able to distinguish between the position of someone who has been ( merely ) arrested , someone who has been charged , and someone who has been convicted of a criminal offence			2
the ruling at the @entity1 overturns guidance issued in the wake of the @entity21 report which said the names of suspects should only be revealed ' in exceptional circumstances ' ‘ the fact of his arrest and other associated information has been extensively referred to in open court , including in public rulings given at criminal trials , and the respondents [ the @entity80 ] want to report this			2
’ historically , police forces have confirmed or denied a suspect has been arrested or interviewed under caution if asked by journalists			0
but this changed in the wake of the @entity21 report into press standards which said only in exceptional circumstances should the names of suspects be released			0
naming suspects at the point of arrest has proved important in a string of cases			0
further victims of both @entity95 and @entity96 came forward after their identities emerged			0
the man involved in yesterday ’s case is appealing to the @entity100 .			1
