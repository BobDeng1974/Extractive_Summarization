by @entity0 published : 20:45 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 29 september 2013 relatives of a @entity3 shooting victim have spoken out for the first time about opposing gun control saying they feel lumped together with other families from the tragedy in favor of new laws			1
though @entity12 , a teacher at the @entity3 elementary school , was shot to death by a crazed gunman , her family still owns firearms - including an assault - style rifle - and is against any measures to control their purchase , according to her sister @entity21			1
for the first time the @entity22 said they wanted to outline their point of view - feeling that in the past they were simply presumed to have the same stance as other families in the massacre			0
a divergent opinion : @entity30 , left , and stepdaughter @entity31 are against tought gun control laws despite their beloved @entity21 being shot to death ' we 're very frustrated mainly because the 26 families got lumped together			1
we 're 26 families made of individuals that all have different opinions , ' @entity31 told the @entity40			2
' it 's like people are speaking for me and speaking for my sister , ' she added , ' they do n't know her and they do n't know us			0
' the family then recalled to the paper @entity46 2009 when they took turns firing rounds into a tree on their five acres of land with an @entity52 - the same type of semi-automatic firearm used to kill their beloved @entity12 , 20 first - grade students and five other school staffers			2
the family takes pride in their marksmanship and record of gun safety , @entity31 told the paper , adding that @entity12 was a good shot herself			1
despite a constant presence of guns in the family 's lives , the only gun - related incident they have ever had was @entity12 's shooting death , her angry sister noted			1
honored , but not in agreement : @entity12 's mother @entity76 ( middle ) , and sister @entity75 ( left ) were honored to meet president @entity78 , but they disagree with him on gun control the family is angered by politicians attaching the name of a shooting enthusiast from a family of gun ownership advocates to a bill that , if passed , would restrict gun ownership rights			1
they declined a ride aboard @entity92 with the president to lobby for gun control , they also declined to meet with vice president @entity94 when he lobbied in the state for tougher restrictions on gun ownership			1
@entity12 would often target shoot in her backyard , her sister says , arguing that attaching her name to gun control legislation is disingenuous			1
@entity31 told the paper members of her family were taught to use firearms at a very young age - being given firearm safety lectures before they were old enough to even clean a gun			1
@entity30 , @entity12 's stepfather , has been around firearms his whole life , he told the paper			2
from pellet guns , to pistols , to assault - style rifles , he knows firearms			0
mr @entity30 also staunchly opposes the gun control laws passed in @entity117 in the wake of the @entity3 shooting , he told the paper			1
he also opposes proposed federal gun control laws , instead favoring improved enforcement of laws already passed			1
loss : @entity12 's boyfriend was going to propose to her on christmas eve with her grandmother 's ring saying goodbye : she was buried with the ring after her funeral in @entity128 , @entity117 last week neither @entity129 , nor @entity40 , mr @entity30 says he was honored to meet president @entity78 - but dislikes how the president has ' used the shooting to further his political agenda '			2
' i have to say meeting the president was an honor			0
he 's a very compassionate man , very genuine , ' said mr @entity30			0
' what i do n't appreciate is the politics			0
he used ( the shooting ) for his agenda			0
our governor did the same thing			0
' he also pointed out that media portrayals of mr @entity146 charging into the school with an assault rife were inaccurate , and only fed into the anti-gun political machine			0
' the shooter in @entity3 did n't use an assault rifle , he used an assault - style rifle , ' mr @entity30 told the paper			2
' it 's much different			0
he could have used a much larger caliber , the same semi-automatic stuff and he could have done a lot more damage			0
' not forgotten : @entity161 blankets the ground as red stockings paying tribute to victims of the @entity3 shooting line the fence surrounding the @entity168 in @entity3 day of sadness : a sign sits at a snow - covered memorial for the @entity3 victims on @entity173 the dead woman 's step - father also argued that treating mental illness would be more effective than controlling guns and tried to make this argument with other @entity3 victim families			2
he said they were shut out of future @entity182 meetings as a result			0
' it 's not the gun that killed the kids , ' mr @entity30 told the paper , ' it 's the mental illness ... it 's a lot easier to take and ram through gun control because it does n't cost anything to ban it			1

@entity31 sister of killed teacher @entity12 has broken her silence on gun control
the @entity12 family wants it known that not all @entity3 families are in favor of gun laws
the family is also calling for an end to politicians using the incident to further their own agendas
