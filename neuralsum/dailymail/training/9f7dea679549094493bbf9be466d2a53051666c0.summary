having run the gauntlet of sibling rivalry at the family home in @entity4 from the age of four , it 's perhaps no surprise that @entity7 developed such lethal , evasive footwork			1
his ability to dance his way out of trouble has been honed through years of attempting to emulate his older brothers , @entity14 and @entity15			1
now he and @entity15 are running amok on behalf of @entity16 – adding a major dash of @entity19 sparkle alongside the @entity22 ' @entity21 core			1
last weekend , the pair of them were try - scorers as the @entity27 champions thrashed @entity28 43 - 10 at @entity30 and director of rugby , @entity29 , made a special point of acclaiming @entity7 's exploits on the wing this season			1
having touched down himself following a quick - step break , the 25 - year - old then teed up @entity15 for a swallow - dive finish which captured the attention of every nearby camera lens			2
@entity7 ( left ) and his brother @entity42 pose together during a photocall at @entity30 the @entity19 brothers were key players in @entity45 's @entity27 winning side last season @entity42 dives over for @entity16 against sale at @entity30 on saturday afternoon @entity7 also got on the score sheet to keep @entity16 firmly on top of the table @entity51 and @entity52 ( @entity53 ) @entity54 and @entity55 ( @entity56 ) @entity57 and @entity58 ( @entity59 ) @entity60 and @entity61 ( @entity62 ) @entity63 and @entity64 ( @entity16 ) @entity15 and @entity7 ( @entity16 ) @entity69 together after training this week , ahead of saturday 's @entity66 showdown with @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity15 reflected on a job well done seven days ago , saying : ' it was n't bad – the little one did well , and he set up a try for the old fella too ! ' the ' little one ' was happy to provide an assist for his outside - centre brother , as a sign of gratitude for providing a hard - knocks education all those years ago			1
whether it was in the back garden or indoors , @entity7 learned the hard way by providing target practice for @entity15 and @entity14			1
' when we were younger we used to play rugby in the lounge , on our knees , ' said @entity15			2
' we 'd get @entity87 to run a straight ( line ) so we could practise our tackling ! my older brother was probably 12 , i was eight at the time , so @entity87 would have been four or five ! we always picked on the little guy ! ' @entity7 added : ' i was the tackle dummy for the other two ! ' the pair of them were highly amused by the memory			1
in fact , they are highly amused a lot of the time			0
they are smilers with a lethal streak on the field ; mixing defensive solidity , slick ball skills and predatory running with an eye for the line			0
@entity15 , then @entity87 , established themselves at @entity16 and they 've gone from strength to strength			2
these days , they 're team - mates – a situation they relish – but for a time back in @entity115 , they were opponents ; which was equally enjoyable , it seems			0
@entity57 and @entity58 have spoken of how difficult they found it to tackle each other in matches , but the same ca n't be said for the @entity7 boys			2
' we were playing together for @entity122 , but then i went down to @entity124 and @entity87 had another two years at @entity122 , ' said @entity15			0
' we played against each other a few times			0
we always wanted to smash each ! it was extra special ! @entity128 forwards @entity58 ( left ) and @entity129 are brothers and play together at @entity59 @entity7 ( left ) and @entity42 work in tandem in the @entity22 backline lions and @entity128 duo @entity133 ( left ) and @entity61 play together at @entity62 ' it was all about brotherly love – a lot of love went into those tackles ! i would say , " you 're a good little player , but i 'm still your older brother ! "			1
@entity7 echoed the sentiment , saying : ' on the field , it 's a different story ; you just want to give it to him ! it 's all about respect			1
' it is respect , @entity150 style			0
@entity15 was born in @entity151 , capital of @entity19 – as was @entity14 , who now plays in @entity152 – while @entity7 was born in @entity4 after the family had relocated to @entity115 for a better life			1
both men have come to be adored in the @entity156 , but now they are gearing up to make trouble for many of their @entity21 colleagues			0
@entity19 come to @entity160 on november 22 as a gloriously rising force , if a somewhat disorganised one			1
they are awash with wonderfully gifted players but tend to be undermined by financial difficulty and administrative chaos			0
that has n't stopped @entity15 warning several club - mates to expect trouble ahead though			0
' i 've been giving them a lot of banter , ' he joked			0
' i 'm saying , " you better watch out because the blue army is coming ! "			0
they will be s * * * * ing themselves about seeing a few flying @entity19 coming their way ! it 's an exciting opportunity for us			1
' never before have all three players represented their pacific - island nation together			0
@entity14 and @entity15 are well established in the side , whereas @entity7 has made just three appearances , two off the bench			1
but armed with @entity29 's endorsement , he is determined to become a regular fixture in a key year leading up to the @entity187 , via an historic first home encounter with the @entity189			2
@entity192 full - back @entity190 breaks away from @entity19 's @entity42 at the @entity193 in 2010 scrum - half @entity194 is another @entity19 player at @entity22 ' it will bring the country to a halt			1
everyone will be at the game , ' he said of the match , to be played in @entity151 on july 8 next year			0
addressing his own hopes , @entity7 added : ' i see it as a priority this autumn ; to play well and try to establish myself in that team , so that next year hopefully i will be at the @entity187			2
i will play my heart out to do that			0
' on saturday , the brothers will play their hearts out in @entity68 , in a back line featuring a third @entity19 , @entity194 , at scrum - half			1
@entity15 recognises the need for @entity16 to start their campaign with a bang			1
' this first hurdle is so important , ' he said			0
' we went away to @entity219 last year and lost			0
if we can beat @entity67 away , it should set us up			2
we want to be one of the best clubs in @entity222			0
' for now , that is the immediate objective , then the @entity224 will set out to terrorise @entity160 .			2

@entity16 duo @entity42 and @entity7 have been two of the *standout* *performers* in the opening rounds of the @entity27
both hoping to get off to a winning start in saturday 's @entity66 showdown with @entity67 in @entity68
siblings used to practice together with older brother @entity14 in @entity4
all three are hoping to represent @entity19 together against @entity128
the @entity237 head to @entity160 next month
