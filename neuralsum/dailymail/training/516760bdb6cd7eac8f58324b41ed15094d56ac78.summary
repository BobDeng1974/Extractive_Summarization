by @entity0 for @entity1 a dazzling conjunction of @entity3 and @entity4 will be visible on monday morning , shortly before sunrise in the @entity6			1
a 2012 conjunction over @entity8 is pictured a dazzling conjunction of @entity3 and @entity4 will provide an impressive light show on sunday night and monday morning			1
the two brightest planets in the sky will form a spectacular ' double star ' , hanging low on the north - eastern horizon			1
this will be visible shortly before sunrise at around 5am bst ( midnight est ) and will appear only 0.2 degrees apart - less than half the width of a little finger held out at arm 's length			1
a number of similar conjunctions were captured in 2012 , but this will be the closest and brightest conjunction of the two planets since 2000			1
experts believe their combined brightness and low position in the sky could keep switchboards busy with reports of @entity32			2
@entity33 , vice-president of the @entity34 , said : ' they will be so close together that it 's going to be quite a striking sight			0
' undoubtedly people could mistake them for a @entity32 , especially being so low down			2
' they might appear to move around because of the distortion effect of the atmosphere			0
' although the planets appear to be kissing - distance apart , as seen from the @entity43 , they are actually separated by hundreds of millions of miles			0
@entity4 and @entity3 pair up about once a year on average , but their conjunctions vary greatly in separation and visibility			2
some are missed completely because they occur in daylight			0
the next @entity4 - @entity3 conjunction is due to occur on june 30 next year , but will be less close			1
during monday 's conjunction , @entity4 will appear six times brighter than @entity54 , even though its diameter is less than a tenth that of the larger planet , which measures 86,881 miles ( 139,821km ) across			1

this will be visible shortly before sunrise at around 5am bst ( midnight est ) and will appear only 0.2 degrees apart ( pictured ) - less than half the width of a little finger held out at arm 's length during monday 's conjunction , @entity4 will appear six times brighter than @entity54 , even though its diameter is less than a tenth that of the larger planet			1
@entity4 and @entity3 pair up about once a year on average , but their conjunctions vary greatly visibility			2
@entity4 and @entity3 at twilight in march 2012 in @entity8 are pictured the planets ' combined brightness and low position in the sky could keep switchboards busy with reports of ufos in the early hours of monday morning			1
@entity33 , vice-president of the @entity34 , said : ' they will be so close together that it 's going to be quite a striking sight			0
' undoubtedly people could mistake them for a @entity32 , especially being so low down			2
' they might appear to move around because of the distortion effect of the atmosphere			0
' that is because @entity4 is much closer to the @entity43 and also nearer the sun , causing its clouds to be lit more intensely			0
a pair of binoculars will heighten the conjunction experience , but even a small telescope should provide a dramatic view			0
@entity4 will mimic a tiny full moon , while @entity3 will appear three times wider			2
@entity3 will also be accompanied by its four brightest moons strung out in a row			0
ideally the conjunction should be seen from a high unobstructed vantage point			0
' people who have buildings , hills or trees in the way might miss it , but even a roof top in @entity109 should offer a good view , ' said mr @entity33 .			0
