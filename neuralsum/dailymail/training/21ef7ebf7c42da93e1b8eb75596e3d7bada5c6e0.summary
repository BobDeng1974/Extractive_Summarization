by @entity0 experts warn children are becoming less able to pick up traditional motor skills as they spend so much time using @entity5 and other modern technology toddlers these days are barely out of nappies before they are playing with touch - screen toys and fiddling with @entity5			1
and now , it seems , they are paying the price – because when they arrive at nursery they are apparently struggling to pick up basic fine - motor skills such as holding pencils , pens and crayons			1
some nurseries have installed interactive ‘ smartboards ’ , digital cameras and touch - screen computers to try to expose children to gadgets at an early age			1
one of the learning goals in the revised @entity28 ( @entity28 ) is that ‘ children recognise that a range of technology is used in places such as homes and school ’			1
under a section on @entity37 , youngsters must also find out about and ‘ identify the uses of everyday technology and use information and communication technology ( @entity42 ) and programmable toys to support their learning ’			0
some nurseries have prioritised @entity42 as a result and ploughed resources into improving their facilities			0
@entity50 from @entity51 – which has invested £ 4million in digital technology – defended the move , saying : ‘ it makes children comfortable and familiar with the technology and that is extremely useful when they start school			2
’ but literacy expert @entity59 said : ‘ i think what children really need up to the age of seven is real life in real space and real time , which means three - dimensional experiences			2
‘ we already have problems with children not being able to hold a pen or pencil			0
' but we are giving our kids instant gratification all the time with @entity42 and it makes it harder for them to persevere with something that takes a while to learn			0
‘ there is a real fear that too much engagement with this quick - fix technology is making it more difficult for some children to learn how to read and write			0
’ june @entity82 , chief executive of the @entity83 , said she is not planning to buy @entity5 for its 24 nurseries			1
while some schools and nurseries plough millions into having the latest technologies , some experts suggest children could do with less exposure to modern gadgets she said : ‘ i know some nurseries are investing in @entity5 for the children but we are not doing that here at the @entity83			1
' @entity5 are the big thing at the moment and yet nobody seems to have done much research into them			0
‘ we know art , music and drama works so why bother with something we do n’t know enough about yet ? ’ and @entity107 , from @entity108 in @entity109 , said : ‘ if our children are in fact the most sedentary generation ever , according to the medical authorities , and already spend more time watching television than they do in school , do we really need to add computers and other screen - based devices to the nursery environment ? ’ a survey of 806 parents and early years staff carried out by website daynurseries.co.uk found that only 26 per cent believed that being exposed to technology actually benefits children in nurseries			1
@entity126 , director of daynurseries.co.uk , added : ‘ children are increasingly exposed to an overwhelming amount of technology at an early age			2
‘ the use of @entity5 in nurseries , which are displacing the traditional methods of learning and playing activities is concerning			2
‘ this poll shows that the majority of people clearly want to see early education and childhood play protected from this technological creep			0
’ ms @entity59 who is also the author of @entity140 added : ‘ i think what children really need up to the age of seven is real life in real space and real time , which means three dimensional experiences .			0
