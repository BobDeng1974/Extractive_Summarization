when sport and social media collide it has the potential to conjure up a somewhat volatile cacophony of opinion and discord all squeezed into 140 characters			0
let ’s face it , there are a fair few sports men and women out there who like the sound of their own voice ( not naming any names ) , but on the odd occasion there is that one person who brightens up your day with a perfectly executed comment			0
so , with that in mind as we prepare to wistfully say a fond farewell to yet another year , @entity22 took a look back on rather eventful 12 months for sports personalities on social media in order to crown the ultimate king and queen of @entity31			2
@entity32 ruffled a few feathers when he commented on @entity35 's wobble against @entity36 @entity32 requested a kiss from the @entity38 if he helped @entity40 's chances during the @entity41 last summer the controversial striker apologising on @entity31 for his anti-semitic post on @entity44 the striker was banned for @entity47 's game against @entity48 on sunday 2014 @entity49 of @entity31 - where to begin ? there were various nominees for this illustrious title but in our eyes there was only one candidate for this one			1
he ’s outspoken , yes , and gets into trouble for airing his sometimes ill - thought ( but well - intentioned ) thoughts online … and that person is @entity47 striker @entity32			1
never one to shy away from the spotlight , @entity32 recently got himself into serious trouble for an @entity44 post that used an anti-semitic tone			1
although the former @entity66 man apologised , he was consequently slapped with a £ 25,000 fine , a one match ban and forced to attend an education course to teach him the dos and don’ts of opening one 's mouth			0
the @entity75 striker was on the losing side for his country 's @entity41 group clash with @entity79 with the issue seemingly put to bed ( until the day he inevitably puts his foot in it again ) , we move onto why we believe the 24 - year - old @entity75 front man deserves such accolade			1
and it was summed up in two concise but hilarious tweets			0
following on from @entity35 ’s embarrassing 5 - 3 defeat by @entity36 back in september , @entity32 went on @entity31 to let his fans know what he thought of @entity94 ’s poor start to the season			0
in just three words , @entity32 took down the @entity98 giants with aplomb by saying ‘ man utd … lol ’ , a tweet that received over 200,000 retweets and 100,000 favourites			2
but his crowning moment came when he delivered again during last summer ’s @entity41 in @entity106			0
speaking ahead of @entity75 ’s clash with surprise group leaders @entity79 , the controversial striker set sides splitting by saying if he were to score and keep @entity40 in competition for qualification he would expect a kiss from none other than the @entity38 herself ... @entity75 lost 1 - 0 and @entity40 were sent packing			1
maybe some other time , @entity32			0
tennis star @entity116 had an emotional year following her split from golfer fiance @entity118 @entity116 thanked her fans on @entity31 s for their support , quoting @entity47 's motto to express her feelings the former @entity124 1 and her ex-fiance and current world no 1 golfer @entity118 split in may so on to this year 's @entity38			1
with fierce competition for the top spot in this contest , we traipsed through a vast amount of tweets from sportswomen throughout 2014			1
it has been a particularly roller coaster 12 months for former @entity136 no. 1 @entity116 , who announced her engagement to professional golfer @entity118 on @entity138 only for him to break it off five months later			1
pouring her heart out on @entity31 , avid @entity47 fan @entity116 thanked fans for their support , adding ‘ happy i support @entity47 right now because i know i ’ll never walk alone ’			2
the @entity142 tennis star showed she was recovering in this toung - in - cheek swipe at 5ft 7in @entity118 not sure she ’ll be as upbeat about her club following their jittery start to this season			2
but that did n't stop the 5ft 9in tennis star from hitting back at her former husband - to - be with a well - worded snipe at golfer @entity118 , who stands two inches smaller			0
tweeting a picture of herself in some killer heels , the @entity153 boasted about being able to wear the shoes for the first time since her relationship started with @entity118			0

@entity22 went through the *archives* for best tweets over the last year
controversial striker @entity32 was named @entity49 2014
the @entity47 man was recently banned for a controversial @entity44 post
tennis ace @entity116 's *highly* retweeted comment following split from @entity118 put her in in no 1 spot for sportswomen
