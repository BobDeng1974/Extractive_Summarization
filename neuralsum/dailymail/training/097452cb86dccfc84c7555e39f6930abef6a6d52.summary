the @entity0 ordered 5,000 body bags from a @entity3 company last month as part of its planned response to an outbreak of the ebola virus in western @entity8			1
and as president @entity9 prepares to enlarge @entity11 's aid to affected countries , a company that makes protective clothing says the @entity15 , which oversees @entity0 , has invited bids for 160,000 hazmat suits			1
the body - bag purchase came on august 19 , just after the @entity19 said the epidemic had killed 1,000 people			2
that death toll is now greater than 2,400			0
the size of the contracts indicates how seriously governments are taking the threat , especially considering that all 5,000 body bags were destined only for @entity28 – one of three countries whose citizens have been hammered with new disease cases and paralyzed with fear			1
and the purchase says nothing about what resources might be coming as part of other nations ' contributions			2
his chief spokesman said monday that the president will announce new levels of support from the @entity11 to fight the disease			1
the @entity55 has begun to warn health care workers and hospital administrators to be on the lookout for potential @entity58 cases			2
' now is the time to prepare , ' reads part of a six - page ' checklist ' being distributed nationwide			0
the agency has already deployed about 100 of its own workers to @entity8 , @entity83 press secretary @entity82 told reporters during his daily briefing			1
' this is , if not the largest , among the largest deployments of @entity55 personnel – ever , ' he said			1
@entity11 , @entity82 added , ' has a unique responsibility to step up in the midst of an international crisis			2
... our doctors and scientists are some of the best in the world			0
' the federal government as a whole has allocated $ 100 million in financing and other resources to assist what has become a continent - wide race against the clock to stamp out a crafty pathogen before it can spread beyond hope of containment			1
that level of support , about one - sixth of what the @entity19 estimates is needed , ' underscores just how extraordinarily serious the administration believes this issue is , ' said @entity82			0
@entity9 's visit will add a new sense of urgency , and more aid to the countries where the threat is the more dire			2
' i do anticipate that we 'll have some additional announcements to make ' on tuesday , @entity82 said , ' about additional commitments we 're making			0
' @entity0 's body - bag purchase was signed august 19 , a $ 32,500 contract with a @entity3 packaging company , earmarked ' for the @entity0 / @entity130 response to the @entity58 crisis in west africa			1
' @entity130 is the agency 's @entity133			0
buying the body bags , however , was just the first step			0
@entity0 inked another contact on august 27 ' for the transport of 5,000 body bags from the vendor 's facility to @entity28			1
' flying them there from warehouses in @entity145 and @entity146 cost another $ 57,144			0
hazmat suits are in demand as health care workers tend to the sick and bury the dead , often removing their bodies unceremoniously in pickup trucks and panel vans hardest - hit areas of @entity8 are in the western @entity154 , with @entity28 being so far the epicenter of death it 's not clear whether the @entity15 's purchase of 160,000 hazmat suits is intended to be delivered all at once , or to which countries they will be delivered			1
but @entity162 , based in @entity163 , @entity164 , reported on friday that ' the @entity15 alone ' has solicited bids ' for 160,000 suits			0
' ' we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments , ' the company said in a press release , ' so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health			0
