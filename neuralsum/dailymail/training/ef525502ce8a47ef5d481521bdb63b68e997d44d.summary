' the @entity9 came under pressure as the ratings agency lowered @entity3 's credit outlook from ' stable ' to ' negative ' in a stark warning that no one is immune to the eurozone problems			1

@entity1 's has downgraded @entity3 's coveted @entity5 credit rating to ' negative ' and a similar move was announced for the @entity18 and @entity19 @entity1 's said all three nations faced risks from @entity25 leaving the eurozone and from the need to stump up cash for potential bailouts for @entity30 and @entity31			1
last night , the @entity3 government downplayed the decision with the finance ministry noting in a statement it had kept @entity3 's @entity5 credit rating the highest possible			1
the impact of the move reverberated around the @entity40 markets this morning when the @entity9 fell 12.33 points , or 0.2 percent , to 5,521.54 points but it has since appeared to stabilise in early trading			1
yesterday , it slumped by 2.1 per cent after a pounding which wiped Â£ 30 billion from its value amid concerns over @entity30 and @entity25			0
bad news : credit ratings were downgraded for fellow aaa ranked economies , the @entity18 and @entity19 the @entity3 government said the risks cited by @entity1 's were n't new and were largely based on a short - term assessment			1

' the ministry said it had ' taken note of @entity1 's opinion ' while stating the ' estimate ' put the focus ' on short - term risks , while stability prospects in the long term are not mentioned			2
' ' the eurozone has initiated a series of measures which should lead to the durable stabilising of the zone , ' the ministry said			0
' @entity3 itself is in a solid economic and financial situation , ' it insisted in a statement			2
@entity1 's rationale for the downgrade appeared to hinge on a likely deepening of the crisis , which appeared to be reaching a fresh denouement monday as @entity30 borrowing costs soared and @entity25 reforms were on the rocks			1
' the level of uncertainty about the outlook for the euro area , and the potential impact of plausible scenarios on member states , are no longer consistent with stable outlooks , ' @entity1 's said			1
even if @entity25 survives , the agency warned that richer nations would likely shoulder greater burdens in future			0
' the continued deterioration in @entity30 and @entity31 's macroeconomic and funding environment has increased the risk that they will require some kind of external support			2
' that would send the eurozone crisis to a different level , it said			0
' @entity30 's economy and government bond market is around double the combined size of those of @entity25 , @entity107 and @entity108 , ' @entity1 's said referring to the three already bailed - out eurozone nations			1

downplayed : the @entity116 building , seat of the @entity3 lower house of parliament @entity119			0
the @entity3 government insisted last night that its economy remains ' in a very solid financial and economic situation ' the government of chancellor @entity20 has repeatedly been frequently criticized for its austerity - first approach and for not getting ahead of the crisis			1
@entity1 's reiterated those concerns , pointing to a ' reactive and gradualist policy response ' by @entity8 leaders as cause of concern			2
@entity3 , which is reluctant to have its taxpayers on the hook for profligate spending in southern @entity8 said it would ' do all it can with its partners to overcome the @entity8 debt crisis as quickly as possible			0
' @entity1 's also announced that @entity139 's aaa rating and outlook were unchanged			2
it came after a turbulent day for the single currency bloc which yesterday saw the yield on 10 - year @entity30 bond hit euro - era highs of 7.5 per cent as it became increasingly likely that the country would need an @entity148 bailout			0
banking stocks suffered amid the ongoing weak sentiment and following reports that they would reveal additional charges for mis - selling payment protection insurance ( @entity154 )			0
@entity156 was 2 per cent or 4.3p lower at 193.5p , @entity155 slipped 2.3p to 150.3p and @entity157 dropped 0.4p to 28.9p			0
outside the top flight , @entity158 fell 2 per cent or 11p to 604p despite revealing an encouraging update which showed growth in @entity162 like - for - like sales of 1.7 per cent for the 12 weeks to july 21 .			0
