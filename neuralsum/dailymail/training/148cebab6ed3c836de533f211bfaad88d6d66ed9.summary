’ the message then asks residents to give their views about which services should be cut , and which should be saved			1
the council ’s number is not a freephone one , meaning callers have to pay the normal local rate charge to hear the message			2
last night @entity42 , a @entity43 vice chairman , said : ‘ this is a new low for @entity1 – ramming @entity46 propaganda down the throats of people while they ’re held hostage on the phone			1

‘ it ’s a disgraceful misuse of hardworking taxpayers ’ money , and is particularly audacious at a time when @entity1 leader @entity72 refuses to talk about the deficit and has no long - term economic plan for the country			2

@entity97 , the council ’s deputy conservative leader , said : ‘ i very much doubt that residents calling the council to have something important dealt with or to ask for advice will be happy to be force fed an anti-government message , nor be pleased at the delay in being able to speak to an adviser			0
‘ it ’s completely the wrong way to deal with customers who are likely to be quite angry when they are eventually put through to a member of staff due to the message			0
