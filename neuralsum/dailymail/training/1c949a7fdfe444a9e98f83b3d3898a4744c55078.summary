by @entity1 reporter fall : the number of slugs , spiders , worms and other invertebrates across the world has fallen by 45 per cent over the past 35 years , a study has revealed the world ’s population of creepy crawlies has fallen by nearly half – but that is bad news for us , experts warn			1
a study published in the journal @entity19 , reveals that the number of slugs , spiders , worms and other invertebrates has fallen by 45 per cent over the past 35 years as the human population has doubled			1
experts fear this will harm the planet as creepy crawlies play an important role in pollinating crops , pest control , decomposition and ensuring soil remains packed with nutrients , as well as water filtration			1
the fall in invertebrate numbers is thought to be linked to the loss of their habitats and climate change			1
in the @entity45 the number of beetles , butterflies , bees and wasps has fallen by up to 60 per cent			1
experts warn that fewer insects would have a huge effect on crop production as up to 75 per are pollinated by insects , amounting to around 10 per cent of the world 's food supply			2
and the cost of pest control without natural predators could be more than £ 2.6 billion pounds in the @entity56 alone			2
scientists fear a drop in the insect population could also spark a decline in birds , which prey on pests that damage crops , and amphibians , which help keep water supplies free from algae			0
decreasing invertebrate numbers are also known to compromise food production due to reduced pollination , seed dispersal and insect predation			0
but the impact the continuing loss of animals , including invertebrates , has on the spread of human disease needs to be better understood as a priority , experts claim			2
dr @entity80 , from @entity82 's @entity81 , said : ' we were shocked to find similar losses in invertebrates as with larger animals , as we previously thought invertebrates to be more resilient			0
decline : in the @entity45 alone , the number of beetles , butterflies , bees and wasps has fallen by up to 60 per cent ' while we do n't fully understand what the long - term impact of these declining numbers will be , we are currently in the potentially dangerous position of losing integral parts of ecosystems without knowing what roles they play within it			1
' prevention of further declines will require us to better understand what species are winning and losing in the fight for survival and from studying the winners , apply what we learn to improve conservation projects			0
' we also need to develop predictive tools for modelling the impact of changes to the ecosystem so we can prioritise conservation efforts , working with governments globally to create supportive policy to reverse the worrying trends we are seeing			0
' lead author prof @entity119 , of @entity120 in the @entity56 , added : ' where human density is high , you get high rates of defaunation , high incidence of rodents , and thus high levels of pathogens , which increases the risks of disease transmission			0
' who would have thought that just defaunation would have all these dramatic consequences , but it can be a vicious circle			0
' we tend to think about extinction as loss of a species from the face of @entity139 , and that 's very important , but there 's a loss of critical ecosystem functioning in which animals play a central role that we need to pay attention to as well			1
' ironically , we have long considered that defaunation is a cryptic phenomenon , but i think we will end up with a situation that is non-cryptic because of the increasingly obvious consequences to the planet and to human well - being			0

@entity139 's population of creepy crawlies has fallen by 45 **%** over past 35 years
insects play a vital role in pollinating crops and pest control , claim experts
fall in numbers thought to be linked to loss of habitats and climate change
in @entity45 , the number of beetles , butterflies , bees and wasps has fallen by 60 **%**
