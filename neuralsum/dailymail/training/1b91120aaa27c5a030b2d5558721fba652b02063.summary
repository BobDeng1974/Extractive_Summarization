by @entity0 as one of television ’s most famous couples , @entity1 and @entity2 have rarely shied away from controversial topics			1
now they have addressed the assisted suicide debate – by revealing details of a suicide pact they have made following the death of @entity1 ’s mother			1
after 26 years of marriage , the presenters said they had made a ‘ pledge ’ to help one another if they were suffering and considered it the ‘ responsibility ’ of their partner , regardless of the consequences			1
tv couple @entity2 , left and @entity1 , right , who say they would help each other to die if the other was suffering under @entity25 law , a partner can be prosecuted if they help someone to die , even if it is abroad			1
but @entity1 , 57 , said : ‘ if @entity2 was really ill and in logical mind , and at that point where you just need a little push to go over the edge , i would n’t give a tuppenny f * * * if there was a risk of being prosecuted			1
‘ i ’d do what was right for my wife			0
and i ’d take the consequences			1
that is your job , that is your responsibility as a partner			1
’ @entity2 , 65 , added : ‘ and i ’d do the same			2
we ’ve made ourselves give each other a pledge along those lines			2
’ her husband then joked about his method , saying : ‘ for me , it would be the locked room , the bottle of whisky and the revolver			0
i would n’t want to mess around			0
’ after 26 years of marriage , the presenters said they had made a ' pledge ' after the death of @entity1 's mother the couple , who became grandparents 18 months ago , revealed they decided to confront the issue when @entity1 ’s mother died last month			1
@entity1 said that although she had @entity66 ’s and lung cancer , her death came a shock			1
‘ at my mother ’s funeral , the first eulogy was given by my 32 - year - old niece who is heavily pregnant , ’ he told the @entity68 as they launched their latest @entity69			2
‘ she was stood in front of the coffin , grandmother , granddaughter and great - grandchild all in the same place			0
and it was … interesting			0
because the death bubble really is n’t that dissimilar from the birth bubble			2
with both , you ’re in this incredibly intense , closed world , and nothing else matters			0
’ @entity2 added : ‘ i remember when my mum died in 2007 and i felt like i ’d been kicked in the stomach			2
i felt something similar with @entity1 ’s mum			1
it ’s just the shock of death			0
it is so final … i suspect that the closer you get to your own mortality , the more final it seems			0
’ assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in @entity100 and @entity101 , technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison			0
guidelines issued in 2010 indicated that anyone acting with compassion on the will of a dying person is unlikely to face charges			0
increasingly , however , severely ill @entity25 are ending their lives by travelling to clinics abroad , such as @entity111 in @entity112 .			0
