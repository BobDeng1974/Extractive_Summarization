in further sign of a growing crisis in emergency departments , the @entity8 in @entity9 failed to ensure that 95 per cent cases were dealt with within the time limit			1
health bosses said they had always known this winter ‘ would be difficult ’ but critics said that it could be a sign of worse to come			0
pressure : @entity3 departments missed the four - hour waiting time target for the first time since april official @entity8 figures show how the 95 per cent target has been missed for the first time in 2013 - 14 it is the first time that the four - hour waiting time target has not been met since april and comes amid warnings that expected winter pressures are only just starting to bite			1
last week , 94.8 per cent of @entity8 patients in @entity9 were treated within the target time of four hours set for emergency departments , including minor injuries units and urgent care centres			1
waiting times were worst in major @entity3 wards where just 92.2 per cent of patients were seen within four hours			1
across @entity9 , 3,678 patients were forced to wait between four and 12 hours for treatment			0
and five patients were not seen for more than 12 hours , the figures show			0
last week , hospitals treated more than 415,000 patients in @entity3 - 3,500 patients more than the previous week			1
@entity9 boss dame @entity43 said the health service always knew this winter would be difficult dame @entity43 , chief operating officer for @entity9 , said : ‘ it is of course disappointing that any patient has to wait longer than they should in @entity3 ; however , we are now seeing many more patients than ever before			1
‘ last week was the busiest so far this year , with 415,400 attendances and 105,800 emergency admissions - the highest number of emergency admissions since we started collecting data in november 2010			2
‘ we know the @entity3 standard is ambitious and that is only right			2
this is the first week since april the 95 per cent standard has not been met ; however , we do know that sometimes this will happen			0
every year we see a dip in the figures for december , with week - on - week variations , which is why we fully assess how local systems are coping with winter pressures over a longer period			0
‘ we knew this winter would be difficult but it is important to stress the @entity8 continues to deliver a good service , with 94.8 per cent of people going to hospital for urgent care this week treated , admitted or discharged within four hours			0
this is thanks to the hard work and dedication of our frontline staff			0
’ it comes after it emerged patients are having to wait longer than six hours in ambulances parked outside @entity3 departments			1
ordeal : a patient in @entity82 had to wait more than six hours outside an @entity3 ( file photo ) @entity84 ; s shadow health secretary @entity85 said : ' patients are waiting hours on end to be seen in @entity9 's @entity3			1
and yet @entity88 and his ministers deny that @entity3 is in crisis			1
' this dangerous complacency ca n't go on			0
2013 has been the worst year in a decade in @entity3 and @entity88 's fingerprints are all over it			2
it is yet more proof that you can not trust the @entity95 with the @entity8			0
' last week alone nearly 4,500 patients were kept in the vehicles for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to look after them			2
figures obtained by @entity100 under the @entity101 covered the three months until the end of october , and revealed that a patient in @entity82 was forced to wait six hours and 22 minutes , while another in @entity104 was held for five hours and 51 minutes			0
senior doctors and nurses said waits in most recent weeks could have been even longer			0
the figures will add to concerns that casualty departments are struggling to cope with the rising numbers of patients expected this winter .			2

3,500 more patients visited @entity3 last week than the week before
*increased* *demand* has left many emergency departments struggling
