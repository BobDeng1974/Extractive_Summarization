should @entity0 start for @entity1 at the @entity2 ? during one of @entity5 ’s first training sessions under @entity6 , the new manager set up a small - sided drill to assess the technical ability of his players			1
@entity6 paid special attention to @entity0 as the young midfielder snatched at a couple of chances and sent them high and wide of the small target			1
‘ it would have been easy for the players to be critical of him , but what impressed me was that he had their complete respect , ’ @entity6 recalled on thursday			1
talent : @entity0 ( centre ) has the full backing of his @entity5 boss @entity6 the @entity5 midfielder composed himself and hit the target with shots into the top left and top right with his next two shots			1
‘ again , no - one said a word , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ they just knew that ’s what he can do			0
’ @entity0 ’s decision - making has become a discussion point after @entity41 ’s fumbled attempt to deflect some of the attention from the youngster			1
@entity1 ’s head coach knows it does n’t work like that , especially with a @entity2 in @entity46 just days away			2
@entity41 , for all his world - wise experience of football at every level , knows better than that			1
or at least he should do			0
toffee : @entity6 believes @entity0 is the ' biggest talent for his age ' in @entity56 football maestro : @entity0 was one of @entity1 's best players during the 2 - 2 against @entity59 @entity6 , who was in his office at @entity5 ’s @entity62 training centre , watched @entity0 ’s outstanding performance against @entity59 in his first start			1
‘ he is the biggest talent for his age i have seen in @entity56 football , ’ he added			1
that is quite a statement			0
‘ he is a special player , a unique player and that is so rare			2
he has power , pace and technical ability - elements you rarely find in a player			2
he would look at home in the @entity77 , @entity78 or @entity79 models , no doubt about it			0
we have a responsibility to develop his talent and to protect and nurture him			0
’ ill - judged : @entity41 attempted to protect @entity0 by criticising his passing after the game 35 - @entity0 made 35 passes against @entity59 , only misplacing three 1 - @entity59 saw his first assist of the season			1
he made none for @entity5 @entity41 wanted to protect him too , but chose his words badly when he criticised @entity0 for giving the ball away too often			1
it was clumsy , particularly after the young midfielder had set up @entity95 ’s goal that started with a nutmeg on @entity97 before a breathtaking run that led to @entity1 ’s second			1
‘ he ’s got drive , he ’s got energy , but he ’s got to learn when to release the ball , ’ was @entity41 ’s damning assessment of his performance			1
it felt like a strange thing to say			0
‘ for every good turn there was a time when he lost the ball and put us on the back foot defensively , ’ he added			2
no 10 : @entity0 ( left ) has been compared to former @entity1 midfielder @entity114 but @entity0 is a breathtaking talent and @entity6 believes he will mature into a ‘ no 6 ’ central midfielder in time			1
he plays a risky game , eager to please and show - off his ball skills for club and country			2
in the right area , it should be encouraged			0
‘ the back heel to @entity124 , the pass for @entity95 ’s goal and the shot @entity128 had , give you an indication of the player that he will become , ’ added @entity6 , who will travel to the @entity2 next week			2
‘ we have to allow him room to develop and let ’s not put too much pressure on him			0
at the moment he is perfectly suited to playing in the no 10 role , but in time he will develop into the complete midfielder			2
nothing fazes him , but the @entity2 is a massive event and @entity128 needs protection			0
‘ we just need to calm things down a bit and do n’t expect too much from him			0
i ’ve seen what @entity41 had to say after the game but i think he was just trying to protect him a little bit			2
’ @entity0 ’s team - mates have been impressed with his ability and he has added another dimension to this @entity1 team ahead of the opening group game against @entity152			1
@entity153 , who captained the team against @entity59 in the @entity155 , is convinced he has the characteristics to be a top player			1
shocked : @entity6 was shocked by the ' complete respect ' that @entity0 had from @entity5 players ‘ it ’s the fearlessness of youth , ’ said @entity153			1
‘ he has great ability on the ball , running at people and taking them out — and that ’s what you want to see			2
‘ it ’s brilliant for him , brilliant for the team and individually to see him come through			0
it ’s great for the team to have players in those attacking areas who can make things happen			0
‘ i ’m sure he will have learnt a lot from the game in terms of positions to pick up , times to turn , times not to			0
but when you ’ve got players like that in a team , players who can run away from people and make things happen , then you ’re very happy			0
going places : @entity153 claims @entity0 has the characteristics to become to top player for @entity1 ‘ he ’s a young boy and good luck to him , it ’s good to see him come in and do so well			1
’ like @entity6 , @entity153 sees @entity0 in a more advanced role in the early phase of his development			1
there is a swagger about the @entity196 , with flashes of @entity114 in his swashbuckling nature			0
at 20 , he is still learning the game			0
‘ he ’s got the bit between his teeth and he ’s more of a no 10 than i ever was , ’ added @entity153			2
‘ he ’s very good at receiving the ball and turning quickly			0
he ’s only going to get better			0
‘ that ’s his first start so , considering that , when you look at him and what he ’s done , he ’s made the second goal and shown enough there that we can say that he deserves his place in the squad			0
he ’s a great addition			0
’ taking them on : @entity0 was willing to run at @entity59 in @entity214 and his positivity led to @entity1 's second goal			1

@entity5 boss @entity6 claims @entity0 is the best player of his age in @entity56
@entity0 impressed during @entity1 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity59
the @entity5 midfielder was criticised by @entity41 for giving the ball away
