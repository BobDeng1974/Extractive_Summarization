award winner : chef @entity1 roasted a ' nasty ' trip advisor reviewer who called a visit to his @entity5 restaurant ' the worst day of my life ' an award - winning chef has barred a diner who left a review on @entity13 claiming he had tried to ‘ give her cancer ’ with a chargrilled dish			1
@entity1 trained at @entity18 - starred @entity17 and has just won the @entity20 restaurant of the year for @entity21 for his bistro @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25			1
so when he got a bad review from a mother and daughter on trip advisor , branding the evening the ‘ worst day of her life ’ , his first reaction was to bite back			1
not only did he respond on trip advisor , but he posted the review on @entity35 , where there was a backlash against the couple - mocking their complaint littered with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes			1
‘ a nasty lady came for dinner at sticky , ’ mr @entity1 wrote			1
‘ when the nasty lady got home , she was really mad			1
so she wrote us a love note			1
’ his former boss , @entity47 immediately backed him : ‘ sounds like she ai n’t ever coming back , ’ he tweeted			2
‘ what you call a win - win situation ! ’ other diners weighed in : ‘ worst day of her life ? ’ one wrote			1
‘ has she never had a loved one or pet die ? a tad over-dramatic i think ! ’ ‘ this is just brilliant			2
i really want to come down and sample such an appalling place , ’ magician @entity59 added			2
the row began when daughter calling herself @entity64 took her mother , who goes by the trip advisor screenname @entity68 , to the restaurant , in @entity24 , @entity25 , which opened three years ago , for a celebration			2
‘ worst day of my life ! , ’ @entity68 wrote on monday on trip advisor , criticizing the ‘ very bad design ’ ‘ horrible attitude ’ and ‘ cheap furniture ’			2
‘ the manager , middle - aged woman was very rude to us , ’ she added			1
‘ i had an half an hour argument with the waitress and then the manage ( sic )			2
just awful , very disappointed with cheap rubbish food			2
‘ any cheap caffe is much better than this restaurant			2
i do n’t recommend and will not in a million years come there again			2
’ the following day her daughter @entity85 , added her own review on the website			0
‘ my mother is a lover and conosur ( sic ) of fine dining , ’ she wrote , ‘ having dined for many years in some of the worlds finest restaurants all over the world			0
‘ my mum was not happy with the meal that arrived as the sauce was not to her taste and the lamb did not appear to be grilled as it says in the menu			0
‘ one would assume that like in any other restaurant and even in the simplest of @entity104 pubs , you would be offered an exchange			0
however instead she had received a whole load of abuse from the waiting staff especially the female manager			1
‘ i can honestly say that i have never felt so uncomfortable in my whole life and the way that my mother was being rediculed ( sic ) is simply disgusting			0
‘ to top off the reuined ( sic ) evening and minus the hard earned cash , instead of an apology to my mum , i receive a voicemail from @entity115 the manager who was n’t there on the evening , arrogantly telling me not to ever come back again ! ‘ because my mother have left a bad review on a trip advisor and ‘ apparently ’ this means that therefore i ’m now also banned			0
‘ avoid this place like the plague guys			0
so many other wonderful , funkier , excellent hidden gems in @entity25 that are a lot more value for money and where you will be valued and treated with love and respect			0
’ unassuming : yet the @entity131 has just won the @entity20 restaurant of the year award for @entity21 however the award - winning chef was not contrite			1
‘ your behavior on the night is just so very rude that it does not warrant a response , ’ he wrote to @entity68			1
‘ as much as we all enjoyed your racial and verbal abuse on the night we would like to see your million and raise you a cool billion			1
’ he was even more vocal in his reply to @entity85			0
‘ your mother , being a “ conosur ” , ordered the chargrilled lamb rump on your recommendation , he said , mocking her for her spelling mistake , ‘ although she had said at the table that she wanted a well - done steak			1
‘ you told her that the lamb would taste like steak ( of course it would - do n’t all “ conosurs ” know that ? )			1
your mother did n’t like the chargrilled aspect of the chargrilled lamb and proceeded ( this is a first for us by the way ) to accuse @entity159 of trying to give her cancer			0
‘ when your mother started to raise her voice and rudely interrupt other lamb eating guests , @entity159 simply went to get the manager for help			0
@entity167 then tried to calm the situation			0
however , your mother had a different agenda			0
‘ your mother poked at a “ cancer causing ” carrot and launched it in @entity167 ’s direction			0
this was after @entity167 had offered a different meal			0
@entity167 had tried to talk to your mother to resolve the “ problem ” but your mother refused to make eye contact and then started to mention cultural differences saying that the two @entity21 girls needed to read more			0
‘ @entity167 politely asked your mother to stop speaking in that way			0
“ the customer is always right ” you say and yes , in most cases this is a fantastic attitude for the service industry to practice but when we receive verbal or physical abuse the customer is most certainly not right			1
