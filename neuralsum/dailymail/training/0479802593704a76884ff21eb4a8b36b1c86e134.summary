@entity1 rules are letting thousands of migrants into @entity3 ‘ by the back door ’			2
nearly 11,000 moved here this year on the basis of having been given citizenship in another @entity8 country			1
the total , revealed in figures from the @entity11 , is up more than a third on the 8,000 cases recorded in 2006			2
many of the migrants would normally have been barred from taking up residence in @entity3			1
crowded island : net immigration to @entity3 hit 252,000 last year but under @entity8 rules they are automatically entitled to come here once they have @entity8 citizenship and start working – or claiming benefits			1
the data , compiled from passenger surveys , shows that 47,000 non-eu immigrants have found their way to the @entity3 using this method over the past five years			2
@entity28 , the @entity29 mp who uncovered the information , said the loophole completely undermined @entity33 efforts to curb the surge in immigration that took place under @entity37			0
she urged ministers to raise the issue in @entity1 and take action to wrest back control of @entity3 ’s borders			0
call for action : @entity29 mp @entity28 miss @entity28 took up the issue herself after a @entity46 documentary in october highlighted the case of an @entity49 family who moved to @entity50 after gaining citizenship in @entity52			1
the family of six were receiving £ 2,300 a month in housing benefit to rent a flat in @entity56 , as well as tax credits and child benefit			0
miss @entity28 said she was ‘ astonished ’ by the number of people entering the @entity3 by this route			0
she added : ‘ the government has made a commitment to cut immigration from outside the @entity8 into @entity3			1
but those efforts are being completely undermined by this astonishing loophole which has already allowed 10,000 non-europeans to sneak in through the backdoor each year			2
‘ the @entity3 public are living with the consequences of a decade of @entity37 ’s open door policy on immigration which is why this government must take on these @entity8 laws that let non-europeans come into @entity3 and access jobs and benefits			1
‘ it is in the @entity3 interest to reject these laws and on this issue , just say no to @entity81			0
‘ this also raises the question of why these people are choosing to come here			0
they have entered the @entity8 elsewhere and chosen to become citizens of other @entity8 countries , yet they are still coming here			1
‘ is it down to a benefits system which encourages people to come here and live off the state ? ’ the revelation raises fresh questions about the @entity95 ’s pledge to cut net immigration to under 100,000 a year			0
last month official figures revealed that the figure had soared to a record 252,000 in 2010			0
popular destination : officials argue that there is little they can do to stem immigration from the @entity8 @entity8 countries all have different requirements for migrants wanting to become a citizen , and there are fears that some could be a soft touch for those whose ultimate aim is to come to the @entity3			1
@entity8 rules mean that asylum seekers are meant to be dealt with in the country of their arrival			1
but in cases where a migrant or asylum seeker has been granted citizenship they are free to travel anywhere in the @entity8			1
critics claim that @entity3 ’s generous benefits system acts as a magnet for migrants			0
ministers have introduced a range of measures designed to curb immigration , including a cap on the number of @entity134 economic migrants coming here and a crackdown on bogus colleges providing a route into @entity3 for migrants posing as students			0
but officials admit there is little they can do to curb immigration from the @entity8 , because free movement of labour is a fundamental principle of the single market			1
a landmark ruling by the @entity149 last week stripped @entity3 of its power to return asylum seekers to @entity152			0
under @entity8 rules , @entity3 officials can return asylum seekers to the first @entity81 country they set foot in			1
but the @entity149 last week said no one should be returned to a country if it did not uphold their ‘ fundamental rights ’			2
this would rule out @entity152 because its asylum system is in such a mess			0
around 90 per cent of illegal migrants enter @entity81 through the country .			2

many would normally be barred - but are allowed in after obtaining citizenship from another @entity8 country
