we show a strong bias toward people of the same ethnicity when it comes to romance online dating sites are now an established way for modern singles to find love , providing a vast pool of other hopeful romantics from all walks of life			1
and despite the fact that nearly all users reported being in favour of inter-race relationships , users of at least one site showed a strong bias toward people of the same ethnicity as themselves when it came to responding to potential matches			1
and interestingly it is women who show this preference most strongly , showing more preference for a partner of their own race than men do			1
co founder and chief executive of @entity33 is quick to point out that this does not mean that the dating sites users are ‘ racist ’ in the traditional sense of the word			0
‘ an individual ca n’t really control who turns them on			0
i do think the fact that race is a sexual factor for so many and in such a consistent way , raises deeper questions			2
’ the only exceptions to this trend are black men who tend to favour @entity50 women , and both @entity52 and @entity50 women , who showed a preference for white men over men of their own ethnicity			1
the results , which come from data collected from over three million @entity60 members , also confirm some age - old stereotypes			2
while women search for a partner around their own age , men are in the market for a 21 - year - old woman , however old they are			2
the data also revealed how ultimately predicable our romantic choices are			0
chief executive of @entity33 is quick to point out that this does not mean that the dating sites users are ‘ racist ’ in the traditional sense of the word while we may like to believe that how we choose a partner down to the nuances of our personality and the deepest darkest aspects of what makes us unique , the survey shows that in fact our romantic choices can be fairly accurately predicted using some depressingly mundane questions			0
answers to such scintillating questions like ' do you like scary movies ? ' and ' have you ever travelled alone to another country ? ' were the same for over three quarters of the matched couples on @entity60 , suggesting that far from being written in the stars , romantic success is more down to day - to - day compatibility .			0
