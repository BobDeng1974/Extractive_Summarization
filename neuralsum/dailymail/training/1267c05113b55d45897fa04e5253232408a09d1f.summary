on a glorious summer ’s day what middle - aged man has n’t imagined himself with the wind in his hair , at the wheel of an open - top sports car ? alas , the majority have to content themselves with a trudge behind the family lawn mower			2
but @entity10 does n’t just dream — and he is n’t content with the limitations of terra firma			1
for £ 12,000 — less than the cost of a small second - hand roadster — the 62 - year - old has built a replica of the celebrated @entity33			1
this elegant @entity35 machine — the first specifically designed single - seat fighter aircraft in aviation history — was much feared by the pilots of the @entity39 and @entity40 , over the skies of @entity42 and @entity43			1
indeed , between july 1915 and early 1916 , it became known as the ‘ @entity45 ’			2
our pilots were mere ‘ @entity45 ’ and they fell in their scores			1
if the sun is shining and the wind in the right direction , mr @entity10 is likely to be taxiing out of his garage and taking off from his rural back garden got his wings : @entity10 takes off from his back garden in his @entity18 replica plane near @entity19 , @entity20 the @entity33 is in the microlight category and is therefore not subject to the same airworthiness regulations as a regular aircraft despite his own mount ’s ( replica ) machine - gun mr @entity10 , who is a commercial airline pilot , has no such murderous intent			1
instead , he enjoys tootling over the rolling countryside around his home near @entity19 , @entity20 , at a cruising speed of 55mph , thanks to his 50 - horsepower @entity67 motor , which runs off the same fuel as his car , mixed with two - stroke oil			1
as it weighs just 115 kilos when empty , the @entity33 is in the microlight category and is therefore not subject to the same airworthiness regulations as a regular aircraft			1
it took 18 months to build using a kit bought from @entity75 , a company based in @entity77			2
partly completed fuselage of @entity10 's @entity18 replica plane near @entity19 in @entity20 which can now reach a speed of 55mph thanks to his 50 - horsepower @entity67 motor since its completion in june 2012 , mr @entity10 has notched up 90 hours ¿ flying time			1
it has a range of 90 miles on a 20 - litre tank of fuel kit parts for @entity10 's @entity18 replica plane : as with most middle - aged male hobbies , it helps if your partner approves since its completion in june 2012 , mr @entity10 has notched up 90 hours ’ flying time			1
it has a range of 90 miles on a 20 - litre tank of fuel , with a sedentary stall speed of 25mph			2
mr @entity10 denies that it is merely a busman ’s holiday			1
‘ it ’s still flying , but it ’s very different from airline flying , ’ he says			2
‘ it ’s the freedom , in some ways it ’s more challenging			0
in the airline world , everything is done by numbers , it all comes out of a book , whereas you rely much more on experience and judgment when you ’re flying from a grass strip			2
‘ the grass is a bit longer , it ’s wet , the wind ’s not quite right — it ’s all down to judgment			0
the @entity18 is very exposed			0
‘ because it is very light it does pick up the ( wind ) turbulence very well , so you have to choose your time for flying it — normally morning or evening , when it ’s a bit calmer			0
’ such great heights : so far mr @entity10 has flown up to 3,000ft but says he would be a bit scared to go any higher than that the @entity33 is in the microlight category and is therefore not subject to the same airworthiness regulations as a regular aircraft the @entity33 was much feared by the pilots of the @entity39 and @entity40 , over the skies of @entity42 and @entity43 support : as with most middle - aged male hobbies , it helps if your partner approves ¿ particularly if your lawn is being used for take - off and landings mr @entity144 said flying a passenger jet is much different - in the @entity18 he said you have to rely much more on experience and judgement so far , mr @entity10 has flown up to 3,000ft			1
‘ i ’d be a bit scared to go any higher than that , ’ he admits			0
‘ in any case , it gets rather cold up there			0
you have to wrap up well			0
’ as with most middle - aged male hobbies , it helps if your partner approves — particularly if your lawn is being used for take - off and landings			0
mr @entity10 ’s wife , @entity159 , is a 54 - year - old teacher and textile artist			1
she is also @entity161 , like the @entity163 ’s designer , @entity162			0
perhaps that is why she has been ‘ very supportive ’ of this home aviation project , the latest of several			0
‘ the only thing she does n’t like about it is that it ’s a two - stroke engine and the exhaust does tend to make rather a smell , ’ explains mr @entity10			1
‘ so she keeps well away when i go flying			0
’ mrs @entity170 says : ‘ i ’m not too worried about him flying , i worry more when he has a long drive			0
i think driving on motorways or country lanes is more dangerous			0
it makes him happy , and i suppose it ’s better than him lingering in bars			0
