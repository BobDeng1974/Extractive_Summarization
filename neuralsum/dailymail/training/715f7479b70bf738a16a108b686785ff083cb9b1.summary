families of passengers on the missing @entity3 flight have expressed mixed feelings over whether the new data released shows that authorities are on the right path to finding the missing plane			1
@entity10 @entity9 , whose husband @entity11 had just started a new fly - in fly - out job in @entity13 when he went missing aboard @entity14 , is a spokesperson for @entity15 , a committee set up to represent families of the 239 passengers and crew who were on the plane			0
this group put the pressure on @entity3 to release the raw satellite data , and @entity23 told the @entity24 a that the move was a ' step towards transparency ' , but ' we are not sure why they held onto it for so long			1
we are grappling with completely changed lives and ... trying to fight to get transparency at the same time			0
we have been through enough , ' she said			0
but the data has left their families bewildered and they have complained that the report is missing data , as well as comparable records from previous flights on @entity14 's route that the families had requested			2
weeks also said that the @entity15 would welcome anyone who can help them interpret the data and give feedback to the group			0
the data from satellite communications with the plane , which runs to 47 pages in a report prepared by @entity64 , features hourly ' handshakes ' - or network log - on confirmations - after the aircraft disappeared from civilian radar screens on march 8			1
@entity71 's acting transport minister datuk seri @entity70 announced the data that helped track @entity14 ( pictured ) will be released to the public tomorrow families of passengers are hoping that opening up the data to analysis by a wider range of experts can help verify the plane 's last location , nearly three months after the @entity81 with 239 passengers and crew disappeared			1
' when we first asked for the data it was more than two months ago			0
i never dreamed it would be such an obstacle to overcome , ' @entity87 , the @entity88 partner of a passenger , said from @entity92			0
@entity87 said experts on flight tracking who have been advising the families would now be able to analyse the data to see if the search area could be refined and determine if @entity64 and other officials had missed anything			1
but she complained the report released on tuesday was missing data removed to improve readability , as well as comparable records from previous flights on @entity14 's route that the families had requested			1
' why could n't they have submitted that ? ' she said			0
' it only makes sense if they are hiding something			0
' the @entity64 control room			2
the @entity116 satellite firm 's data , which contains signals sent by @entity14 will be reanalyzed the data 's release had become a rallying cry for many of the families , who have accused the @entity71 government of holding back information			1
based on @entity64 's and other investigators ' analysis of the data , the aircraft is believed to have gone down in the @entity129 , off western @entity10			1
@entity71 investigators suspect someone shut off @entity14 's data links making the plane impossible to track , but investigators have so far turned up nothing suspicious about the crew or passengers			1
in the hours after the aircraft disappeared , an @entity64 satellite picked up a handful of handshake ' pings ' , indicating the plane continued flying for hours after leaving radar and helping narrow the search to an area of the @entity129			1
the dense technical data released on tuesday details satellite communications from before @entity14 's take - off on a saturday morning at 12.41am local time ( 4.41pm gmt ) to a final , ' partial handshake ' transmitted by the plane at 8.19am ( 12.19am gmt )			1
unprecedented : twenty - six nations have been involved in the search for @entity14 since it disappeared the data includes a final transmission from the plane 8 seconds later , after which there was no further response			0
the data also featured two ' telephony calls ' initiated from the ground at 6.39pm gmt and 11.13pm gmt that went unanswered by the plane			2
@entity71 officials were not immediately available to answer questions on the data			1
calculations based on the pings and the plane 's speed showed the jetliner likely went down in the remote ocean seven to eight hours after its normal communications were apparently cut off as it headed to @entity92 on its routine flight			2
the time of the last satellite contact was consistent with the plane 's fuel capacity			0
the search in an area around 1,550 km ( 960 miles ) northwest of @entity183 was further narrowed on the basis of acoustic signals believed to have come from the aircraft 's ' black box ' data recorders before their batteries ran out			2
after the most extensive search in aviation history failed to turn up any trace of the plane , however , officials have said that it could take a year to search the 60,000 sq km ( 23,000 sq mile ) area where it could have come down			0
@entity71 , @entity198 and @entity10 said in mid-may they had agreed to re-examine all data related to the missing plane to better determine the search area as the hunt enters a new , deep - sea phase			2
@entity71 is also leading an official international investigation under @entity206 rules to probe the causes of the baffling incident .			0
