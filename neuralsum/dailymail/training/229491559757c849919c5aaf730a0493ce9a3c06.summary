by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 07:52 est , 3 december 2013 @entity1 suggested it would be difficult for the @entity3 to meet a key immigration target yesterday as he rejected suggestions his government is losing its grip after a series of u-turns			1
the prime minister insisted tough measures to limit the number of incomers would continue - but pointed out that fewer @entity14 were leaving for foreign climes			1
before the election , the @entity16 said they aimed to cut net migration from around 250,000 a year under @entity19 to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
@entity1 , on a trade trip to @entity22 , has admitted that it will be difficult for the government to meet targets on immigration , because not enough people are leaving @entity14 but the latest figures showed that 182,000 more people came to @entity14 than left in the year to june , up from 167,000 in the year before			1
mr @entity1 dismissed the idea that the target was ‘ impossible ’ to meet because fewer @entity14 are now emigrating to the struggling @entity32			1
‘ i do n’t accept that , ’ the prime minister said			2
‘ if you take the whole three year period [ since the election ] , net immigration is down by a around third			1
but he said : ‘ the action we have taken takes some time to come through - getting rid of bogus colleges , trying to make sure that people who do n’t have a right to stay here leave , making sure that family reunion really is just that			0
the delicacy bamboo fungus – thought to be an aphrodisiac – was served twice to @entity1 on his first day in @entity22 yesterday			1
the tropical mushroom , also known as tropical stinkhorn or phallus indusiatus , is renowned for its pungent smell			0
it has been part of @entity22 haute cuisine since the 17th century			2
the delicacy was served to mr @entity1 and other guests as the @entity58 band played at a lunchtime banquet hosted by premier @entity60			1
at an evening banquet with president @entity63 , it was on the menu again as soup accompanied by sturgeons ’ marrow			0
mr @entity1 was also presented with gifts from premier @entity60 , including a painting of a horse , a model of a bullet train and a doll for the prime minister ’s youngest child @entity76			1
in return , he gave his @entity22 counterpart - a keen tennis fan - a racquet signed by @entity80			0
his wife professor @entity81 , an @entity82 professor , received a selection of @entity85 winning novels , by authors including @entity87 and @entity88			0
the couple were also presented with a selection of biographies : @entity92 on @entity93 ; @entity94 on @entity95 ; @entity96 on @entity97 ; @entity98 on @entity99 ; and the @entity101 ’s @entity100 on @entity102			0
president @entity63 was presented with an @entity82 football shirt signed by the team , while his wife was given a pair of gloves by @entity109			0
‘ a lot of these things take an amount of time to be dealt with			0
’ but he went on to point out that when the @entity3 set the goal of reducing net migration to tens of thousands a year - one which has never been accepted by the @entity118 - at a time when emigration was helping to balance our immigration			1
‘ i made the pledge of trying to get net migration down to the tens of thousands , rather than the hundreds of thousands , on the basis that actually over the previous period migration flows within @entity126 have been relatively balancing out when it ’s been migration from outside @entity126 that ’s been topping up the numbers			1
' we have seen that migration from outside @entity126 come down in terms of net figures and we need to make further progress			2
‘ so i ’ll keep going on this			0
the @entity14 public want firm and consistent action on immigration and that ’s exactly what they ’re getting from me			1
’ only last week it emerged net migration had risen for the second consecutive quarter to 182,000 - mostly with people fleeing eurozone countries in sourthern @entity126			1
but the largest group of migrants came from @entity22 - in the form of students			0
about 40,000 arrived in the 12 months to june , 8.7 per cent of the total , and means @entity22 has overtaken @entity152 as the leading source of immigrants			0
however officials pointed out that the majority did leave again at the end of the courses			0
the prime minister insisted the coalition was still working well - pointing to the weekend deal on slashing green levies to bring down energy bills by around £ 50 a year			2
he said the coalition parties had also reached ‘ good agreements on immigration ’ but claimed the @entity118 were a restraint on tougher measures			2
he added : ‘ would i like to go further ? yes i would			0
’ mr @entity1 said he was not concerned about the perception that the government was being buffeted by events , having made u-turns on issues including capping interest rates on payday loans and plain cigarette packaging , and responded to @entity19 ’s promise of an energy price freeze with action to cut bills			2
‘ on payday lending , this is the first government that has actually regulated properly this industry			0
we got in , we were n’t happy with what we saw , we set up the @entity187 , properly regulating payday loans			0
' a key @entity189 election pledge was to reduce immigration to ' tens of thousands ' but in the year to june net migration rose to 182,000 from 167,000 the year before mr @entity1 added : ' but i think it ’s right , you look at the evidence , listened to the arguments and i think it ’s time for an interest rate cap			1
‘ on energy prices , if you can cut household energy bills by rolling back on the cost of levies then it makes sense to do so			0
‘ this is something i announced i would do in the @entity207 and a month later we have done it			0
you say you ’re going to do something , you work hard to achieve it , and then you do it			0
’ part of the rise can be explained by the fact that fewer @entity14 are leaving the @entity14 than three years ago ( file pic ) on the move towards plain cigarette packets , which comes months after the government shelved the idea , the prime minister said : ‘ you look at the evidence , look at what ’s happening overseas , look at the evidence of what works , and take the appropriate course			1
‘ if you look at the big picture of this government , that has taken incredible difficult long - term decisions to turn the economy round , decisions we can now see are paying off as our economy is growing , unemployment is falling , there are 400,000 new businesses are operating , the world is beginning to see that the @entity14 economy is one of the most open , exciting and dynamic in the world			1
‘ listen to businesses ... their sense of momentum in the @entity14 economy			2
this is a government that has a long - term plan to turn the country round			2
‘ so whereas obviously in the bubble people can get obsessed by this decision or that decision , the big picture about this government is that it has taken difficult decisions , it has stuck to them and it ’s really beginning to deliver for the @entity14 economy			1

@entity1 said immigration target will be difficult to meet
@entity189 election pledge was to reduce immigration to ' tens of thousands '
however net migration rose last year from 167,000 to 182,000
@entity268 was in part *due* to fewer @entity14 leaving the country to live elsewhere
