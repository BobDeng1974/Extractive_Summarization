investigators say 24 - year - old @entity9 was shopping at a nearby @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , when a fire broke out in her home 's kitchen			1
the fire is believed to have been sparked by oil in a frying pan in the care home 's kitchen , which started while @entity21 , who was indicted on four counts of felony murder , was shopping at a @entity24 and passing time in a @entity25			1
@entity9 , accused in the deaths of four children at her west @entity11 daycare , pictured during the opening statements at the @entity30 scene of the deaths : fire crews can be seen dealing with the aftermath of the deadly blaze , believed to have been caused by oil in a frying pan prosecutors played back surveillance video that they say shows @entity21 shopping alone at the @entity24 on the morning of the fatal blaze in february 2011			1
they also allege that she also went shopping earlier that morning , leaving behind the children who ranged in age from 16 months to 3 years old			1
the video later shows her van leaving the store 's parking lot , though it is n't clear if the children are in the vehicle			2
@entity21 's attorneys also showed a video , one she took the day of the fire that shows her loading the children into the van			2
however , defense attorney @entity60 did not say what time the video was taken or if it was before @entity21 had gone to @entity24			0

it 's time to go			0
' three - year - old @entity66 , who died in the fire , could be seen running outside of the home to the van			2
@entity21 's attorneys argue that she never intended to hurt the children and that she tried to save them from the fire , which injured three other children			2
@entity21 was indicted on four counts of felony murder , three counts of abandoning a child and two counts of reckless injury to a child			0
but she is currently being tried in @entity11 on just one of the murder counts , for the death of 16 - month - old @entity68			2
if convicted , the 24 - year - old @entity21 faces a sentence ranging up to life in prison			0

@entity21 can be seen arriving at the store at 1:06pm , paying for her items and then lingering in a @entity25 in the store before leaving at 1:22pm			0
more testimony about when @entity21 was in the @entity10 is expected today , and the trial is expected to last about a month			0
legal experts say that if prosecutors can prove the deaths occurred because she abandoned the children to go shopping , they do n't need to prove intent to harm to secure a murder conviction			1
under @entity12 law , a person can be convicted of felony murder if he or she committed an underlying felony and that action led to the death .			0
