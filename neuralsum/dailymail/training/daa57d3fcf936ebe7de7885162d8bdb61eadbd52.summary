the federal government drew up plans to detonate 23 nuclear bombs in a @entity4 mountain range to blast over a passage for a new railroad and highway , it has been revealed			1
the scheme , which was deemed ' safe ' by scientists at the time , is one of more than two - dozen ideas dreamed up at the height of the atomic age for @entity15 - a bid to harness the devastating power of nuclear weapons for civilian use			1
other ideas included using five bombs to dig out a harbor on @entity24 's @entity23 , digging an alternative to the @entity26 across @entity27 and using underground blasting to unleash the oil from the tar sands in @entity31			0
during this time , engineers were testing the limits of nuclear propulsion - drawing up plans for nuclear yachts and ferries , nuclear - powered rocket ships , nuclear powered planes and @entity40 even designed a prototype for a car - the @entity43 - with an atomic reactor			1
plumes from the blast exposed thousands of people to radiation the map shows that few people lived with a 50 - mile radius of the proposed blast site			0
experts predicted it would have little effect on people on the environment @entity70 intended to blow open the mountains to make room for a new highway and rail line through the southern @entity51			1
@entity75 and the parallel train line had to run several miles of the way to get around the steep mountains			0
the operation would have saved the federal government $ 8million over the cost of conventional blasting through the @entity84 in the @entity51 , the @entity79 estimated in 1963 , according to @entity85			1
the plan called for 22 nuclear bombs to be detonated deep in the mountain to blast a 500 - foot deep chasm			1
the final fission explosive would have been used to create a crater for drainage			0
' the study group has concluded that this project is technically feasible			0
it can be done , and it can be done safely , ' @entity4 highway engineers wrote in a report			1
the blasts would have excavated 68million cubic yards of rock and gravel			0
the atomic age caused @entity102 to dream of world without internal combustion engines or fuel			0
engineers designed small ships , airplanes and even rocket ships with nuclear reactors - though few came to reality			2
@entity40 even fleshed out a prototype @entity116 fission - powered car equipped with its own nuclear reactor			2
one project that did come to fruition - the @entity119 , a 600 - foot cargo ship and cruiseliner - was built in 1959 to show off the peaceful uses of nuclear energy			2
barely bigger than some modern day super yachts , the ship was dramatically smaller than nuclear - powered warships of the day			2
the @entity127 flew several dozen flights with a nuclear reactor , but the program was scrapped the @entity119 was the world 's first civilian nuclear - powered ship			1
at less than 600 feet long , it was barely bigger than some modern super yachts end the end , however , the @entity119 proved too costly to operate for commercial purposes			0
both the @entity102 and @entity137 built nuclear - power long - range bombers in the 1950s and early 60s , as well			2
both the @entity139 and the @entity127 flew dozens of test flights with a reactor in place - though they never ran on nuclear propulsion			2
cost , safety and environmental concerns led to both the @entity137 and the @entity102 the cancel the programs			0
@entity40 built a scale model of a neutrino - a fanciful concept car that would have run on a nuclear reactor and a steam turbine @entity70 was actually deemed safe by engineers in the day - though thankfully it was never tested the mountains in @entity4 were too high to build roads or rails across - so either a tunnel or a passage way had to be blasted out cutting through the mountain : @entity70 was meant to allow a highway to pass through the mountains - rather than around them , like @entity75 was forced to do			1
modern day @entity164 passes near the planned route the study - and all other @entity168 projects - come around when @entity102 were still enamored by the potential of nuclear explosions			0
disasters and near disasters that have shaped the modern fear of nuclear power had not yet happened			0
the partial nuclear reactor meltdown at @entity176 took place in 1979			0
the chernobyl disaster was not until 1989			0
the 1962 @entity180 nuclear test in @entity54 exposed the dangers of using nuclear weapons for engineering when a radiation plume contaminated people as far away as @entity185 - exposing the risks of detonating nuclear weapons			1
the @entity189 project was shelved and eventually engineers used conventional explosives to blast through the @entity84 to build @entity164			1
@entity192 would have blasted a new trans - ocean canal across @entity27 @entity15 spent nearly a quarter billion dollars researching civilian uses for nuclear weapons between 1959 and 1971			1
the project carried out 27 nuclear tests during that time			0
here are some of the more outlandish plans from @entity15 :			1

the 1963 plan would have blown at hole through the @entity84 in @entity4 , to make way for a road
it was part of @entity15 , which sought to find civilian engineering uses for nuclear weapons
plan was scrapped in favor of using conventional explosives
