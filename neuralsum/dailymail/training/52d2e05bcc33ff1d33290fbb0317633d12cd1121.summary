by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 20:10 est , 3 april 2013 with vast stretches of open water , forests , lush green scenery and @entity7 's highest peak , the @entity1 is one of @entity10 's favourite tourist spots			2
but a tourist board in a run - down south @entity13 district have written to @entity15 authorities demanding they change their name			1
the @entity18 , based in the borough of @entity20 , said that there is only one official lake in the @entity1 - so the title should be dropped			2
outstanding beauty : @entity25 which officially is the @entity1 's only lake green and pleasant land : an evening view of @entity28 from @entity29 in the @entity1 and as their area of @entity13 has two lakes , they are demanding the right to use it themselves			1
the self - styled tourist group run history tours and walks of south @entity13 and insist their scenery is every bit as good as in @entity40			1
they said @entity42 has a better claim to the title of the @entity1 as it has two lakes - the 116 - acre @entity46 and 28 - acre @entity47			2
@entity48 : @entity47 is picturesque but not quite in the same league of those of the @entity1 leisure facility : @entity47 which is one of two lakes in the south @entity13 borough a rainbow over @entity56			1
the south @entity13 lakes have been dismissed as nothing more than ' ponds ' by @entity1 tourism bosses @entity61 : an accommodation block in @entity42 which attracts considerably fewer tourists than the @entity1 which is visited by an estimated 16million people a year @entity65 : 16,500 @entity66 : zero @entity67 : one - @entity25 ( its others are not officially lakes ) @entity42 : two - @entity46 and @entity47 @entity70 : @entity72 , @entity73 which is @entity7 's tallest mountain , @entity71 and @entity75 : @entity42 clock tower , @entity77 , @entity56 @entity78 : the @entity79 : @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82 : @entity83 the dog who recovered the @entity87 trophy from @entity80 to @entity89 , some famous names have been associated with the @entity1			1
in contrast , in @entity42 they have @entity83 the dog , who found the stolen @entity87 trophy hidden under a bush in 1966			1
famous sites in the area include @entity42 clock tower , @entity77 and the house where @entity98 lived			2
@entity99 , an associate of the @entity18 , said : ' we have got two fantastic lakes here for fly - fishing , walks and everything you could wish for			0
' the so - called @entity1 in @entity40 has in fact only one lake , @entity25 , all the rest being styled meres , tarns and waters			1
' @entity42 has two at least , and a possible third			0
' @entity18 has therefore decided we have a greater claim to be styling ourselves the @entity1 and we have now informed the @entity15 authorities to desist from using the title pending further action on our part			0
' around 16million people visit the @entity1 every year			0
mr @entity99 added : ' it 's all very well claiming the title and getting millions of visitors every year , but in the end it 's a false claim - the place only has one lake			0
' our lakes are gorgeous and underused and we have written to the @entity40 authorities saying we have the right to also call ourselves the @entity1			0
' it is just so beautiful around @entity42 , we really are @entity13 's answer to the @entity1			1
' @entity129 hit back and said that the ' lakes ' in south @entity13 are ' merely ponds '			1
@entity131 , the managing director of @entity129 , said : ' @entity42 has three ponds			0
unsightly : run - down @entity20 town			0
a self - appointed tourist board claim it should be named the @entity1 - as it has more lakes a man walking past a row of boarded up shops in @entity42 ' we have @entity7 's longest lake in the shape of @entity72 , @entity7 's deepest lake , @entity143 , 14 other lakes and hundreds of meres , tarns , and other bodies of water			1
' i 'm sure the ponds of @entity42 have their merits and it is flattering that they wish to emulate our natural environment , albeit in a modest way			0
' however , i do n't recall @entity42 being immortalised by great poets like @entity80 and @entity157 and i ca n't believe that it will be a substitute for the magnificent natural environment to be found here in @entity40			2
' so citizens of @entity42 , please get yourself to @entity163 and in under 3 hours you can treat yourself to a slice of the real @entity1			0
' @entity42 resident @entity166 , 45 , said : ' @entity42 is a bit run down and it 's hardly going to compete with the @entity1			2
' the two lakes and parks are lovely , but i must admit i 'd rather take a trip to @entity40 than we wandering around a district of @entity20			0

@entity1 attracts an estimated 16million tourists a year
@entity42 's famous past residents include @entity83 the dog who found the stolen @entity87 trophy
@entity1 officially only has one lake while there are two in @entity42 - so self - styled tourism bosses demand the right to use the name
@entity40 tourism bosses hit back and say south @entity13 only has ponds
