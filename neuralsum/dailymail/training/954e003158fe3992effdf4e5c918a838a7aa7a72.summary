cocky , bad guys may usually get the girl in the movies but the same is n't true in real life , according to new research			1
it showed that being humble is the key to marking yourself out as a good romantic partner while arrogance and egotism are turn - offs , it found			1
humility in men was just as important to attracting women , as humility in women was to attracting men			1
psychologists who carried out the research said that being humble means people can ' overcome desires for power and superiority ' in a relationship and instead put the relationship itself first			1
this means it not only makes you an attractive bet , it also protects against ' wear and tear ' within long - term relationships			2
' these results support the idea that humility is important for both the formation and repair of romantic relationships , ' said lead author dr @entity56 , of @entity57 in @entity58			1
' @entity11 appears to be a personality trait that is desirable in romantic partners and useful for maintaining romantic relationships under strain			0
' the authors said humble people see their strengths and weaknesses accurately , accept criticism as easily as compliments and are likely to be helpful and generous			2
the findings will give hope to men who feel more like @entity30 's bumbling character in @entity31 than they do @entity32 in @entity33 previous evidence suggests people may judge humility to understand how they could expect to be treated by a potential partner or in a group , they added			1
the research , published in the @entity79 , involved three studies carried out by dr @entity56 and colleagues			1
in the first study , 41 students created dating profiles and answered personality questions in the belief that others would see their results and they would look at other students ' profiles			0
but instead , all participants were shown the same mock profile and personality scores for a fictional potential date who was agreeable , extraverted , conscientious , not neurotic , and open			0
the only difference was that in some cases , the person was scored as highly humble and in others as not humble			2
in the study by @entity57 in @entity58 , both men and women preferred the humble profile as a potential date to the profile that suggested arrogance both male and female participants gave significantly higher ratings to the humble person and were more likely to want them to see their own profile , give them their phone number and meet them			1
the second study , involving 133 students , was similar but varied the language used to describe a potential date in the profile , rather than using numbers to rate humility			0
for example , the humble profile stated ' other people say i 'm smart , but i do n't like the attention ' , while the other read ' i 'm a really good student and pretty smart ... i guess it just comes naturally			2
' again , both men and women preferred the humble profile as a potential date to the profile that suggested arrogance			1
the final study involved questioning 416 participants in real life relationships , half of them long - distance relationships that are likely to be more stressful			2
researchers also found that people who thought of their partner as humble were more likely to forgive them than people who thought their partner lacked humility questionnaires asked about their tendency to forgive , their feelings about a recent time when their romantic partner offended them and their partners ' level of humility			0
researchers found , as expected , that people were less forgiving if their partner lived far away			0
they also found that people who thought of their partner as humble were more likely to forgive them than people who thought their partner lacked humility			0
participants who believed their partners to be very humble were equally likely to forgive them regardless of whether they lived close together or far apart			0
but people lacking humility were less likely to be forgiven by long - distance partners			0
the authors suggest humble people may ' quickly see their partner 's point of view , express remorse and attempt to rebuild the relationship , whereas arrogant partners may stonewall , act defensively , deny wrongdoing , or blame the victim			0

new research shows arrogance and egos are turn - offs for men and women
a humble nature was a key attraction for both of the sexes
