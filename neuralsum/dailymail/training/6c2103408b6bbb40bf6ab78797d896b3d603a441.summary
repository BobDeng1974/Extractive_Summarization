by @entity1 reporter published : 06:45 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 07:20 est , 26 october 2012 when mobile phone handsfree kits first emerged , many were surprised to see people walking around or riding public transport apparently talking to themselves			2
well , it could be time to once again reassess the standards according to which we judge normal behaviour			2
a new glove lets you write messages on your phone by simply wagging your fingers			1
it means social networking addicts can now send tweets , texts and @entity21 messages without having to touch a screen or keyboard			1
catching up with science fiction : @entity25 shows off the keyboard glove , left , the concept of which is similar to the gloves used by @entity31 's character in minority report as he trawls through a computer database the new technology is similar to that imagined in the 2002 science fiction film @entity32 , in which @entity37 - played by @entity31 - uses a pair of gloves to interact with a computer database			1
with the keyboard glove , instead of tapping keys , the user simply uses their thumb to touch points on their fingers or palm , which are assigned a letter of the alphabet			1
other areas include keyboard functions , such as ' space ' and ' enter '			1
a @entity55 company hopes to clinch deals with major mobile phone and tablet makers after developing software that enables users to control their devices by moving their eyes			1
' you can use it for basic control , such as turning to the next page in an e-book , and playing games with your eyes , ' chief executive and co-founder of @entity73 , @entity74 , said			0
the software uses infrared light reflected from the pupil of the eye , which is recorded by the device 's camera , enabling users to scroll or click on their screens with their eyes			1
when you are reading an e-book and get to the bottom of the page , the software will know to turn to the next page , or if you look away from the screen it will dim it			0
@entity73 is made up of four @entity91 students who founded the company a year ago			0
they received $ 800,000 ( 615,000 euros ) in funding in august to develop the technology			1
the company plans to release the technology at no cost to other software developers early next year			1
thin wires carry the ' keystrokes ' to a matchbox - sized control unit on the back of the glove , which transmits the commands via @entity105			0
the @entity106 works with computers , mobile phones , games consoles , music synthesisers and even military equipment			0
it was designed by four computer engineers at the @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116			0
@entity117 said the inspiration came from his interest in science fiction movies and experience with touch - screen technologies			1
' @entity123 as a touch screen that works by tapping your fingers to your thumb on a gloved hand , ' he said			2
' it could be used as a keyboard for the consumer market or the medical field for people limited to one hand due to a disability			2
' once mr @entity25 and his partners came up with the idea , they researched the most frequently used characters on a keyboard			1
common keystrokes got the easiest finger - thumb alignments like the fingertips			0
less common ones required more hand contortions to make the contacts			0
you can even delete words while wearing the glove by performing a swiping gesture with your hand			0
the keyboard characters are sewn into the finger and palm positions to make it easier to learn			2
these letters can be removed once the positions have been memorised , making it look more like a traditional , plain black glove			0
the gauntlet in action : instead of tapping keys , the user simply uses their thumb to touch points on their fingers or palm , which are assigned a letter of the alphabet			1
other areas include keyboard functions , such as ' space ' and ' enter ' @entity175 , who is also working on the project , said : ' we tried to figure the easiest places to touch your finger with your thumb			2
' we then put the most commonly used letters there to make the glove as efficient and easy to use as possible			0
' the developers are now seeking a patent and hope to see the glove on shop shelves soon .			0

gauntlet keyboard allows users to write messages by touching points on their palms and fingers
similar to technology in @entity32 and creator @entity25 says his inspiration came from interest in science fiction movies
