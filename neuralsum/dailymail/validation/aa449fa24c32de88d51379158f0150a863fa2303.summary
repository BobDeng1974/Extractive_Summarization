@entity0 has lambasted @entity1 over the referee ’s role in the goal that sealed a 2 - 0 win for @entity6 at @entity7			1
the @entity9 boss was astonished that @entity1 did n’t award a free - kick after @entity11 appeared to foul @entity12 as the centre - half sought to clear			1
@entity14 seized the loose ball and , with the home defence still appealing for an infringement , cracked home an 80th - minute shot that added to @entity11 ’s opener			1
@entity9 manager @entity0 speaks to the fourth official ; he was unhappy with the referee 's performance referee @entity1 was on the end of some stick from @entity9 boss stubbs after their game against @entity6 @entity0 attempted to pick his words carefully afterwards but could n’t disguise his anger towards @entity1 , who has been at the centre of numerous controversies this season			1
‘ can i say no comment in case i get into any trouble ? ’ @entity0 opened			1
‘ i ’ve been in management a short time			2
i was a player a long time			2
over the years , that decision would be given 100 per cent of the time			2
‘ i think that ’s probably the best way to describe it without me getting into trouble			2
‘ not 90 per cent , not 99 per cent , 100 per cent			0
but a guy who has an influence over a game decided differently			1
@entity0 was sure that a foul on @entity12 ( right ) would have been given ' 100 per cent ' of the time @entity0 ( centre ) watches on from the dugout as his @entity9 side fell to a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity6 ‘ when he sees it back again ... well , there ’s no point			1
he ’s there to get the big calls right and he got a big call very , very wrong			0
‘ there was no point speaking to him afterwards			0
everyone in the stadium could see it was a foul			0
‘ i do n’t want to sit here and try to justify a decision			0
only one guy can do that , but he ’s protected and not allowed to talk			0
it spoiled the game , although obviously not from @entity6 ’ point of view			1
’ @entity12 was booked for his protests towards @entity68 as @entity6 celebrated @entity14 ’ s first goal since december			1
‘ most of the stadium felt it was a foul , ’ said the defender			0
‘ i thought it was but the referee thought differently			2
@entity14 ( centre ) celebrates after his goal gave @entity6 an unassailable 2 - 0 lead over @entity9 @entity14 is mobbed by the ecstatic @entity6 supporters who had made the trip to @entity7 on saturday ‘ i read the pass , got in front of @entity11 and went to clear with my right foot			1
i just felt like i was taken out			0
‘ it ’s disappointing a decision like that has maybe ruined our chances of getting anything from the game			2
‘ i was n’t given an explanation , he ( @entity68 ) just decided to book me for dissent even though i did n’t say much			0
‘ i just said it was a foul , along with everyone else who surrounded him			0
‘ i did n’t even think i was in his face but i think he just has to pick a player and book him			0
