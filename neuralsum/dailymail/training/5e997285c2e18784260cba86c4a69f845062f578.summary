by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor first - time buyers are bearing the brunt of @entity5 ’s housing boom , with prices rising by more than 10 per cent in a year			1
people getting on to the first rung of the property ladder paid a record £ 199,000 in april this year , almost 10 times the average salary of people in their twenties			1
in the year to april prices for all buyers rose by 9.9 per cent , the biggest increase for four years with @entity17 values surging by 18.7 per cent to £ 485,000			1
property prices for first - time buyers are rising by more than 10 per cent in a year , outstripping rises for people already on the housing ladder for the last year the latest figures from the @entity23 reveal the crippling impact of soaring prices on people trying to buy their first home			1
prices for first - time buyers have soared since the start of the year , and in april were 10.7 per cent higher than the same month in 2013			1
for those already on the property ladder , prices are up by 9.5 per cent			2
it marks the biggest rises for new homebuyers for four years , and will fuel fears that the booming property market means the dream of homeownership is pushed even further out of reach for many			0
every region has seen property values increase over the last year , from @entity17 's 18.7 per cent uplift to a 2.6 per cent annual rise in @entity45			1
however , the dominance of @entity17 and the @entity47 is skewing the picture of the property market			1
the @entity5 average home is worth £ 260,059 but if @entity17 and the @entity47 were removed from the findings , the average is just £ 199,000			1
property values have jumped by 10.4 per cent across @entity53 over the last year to reach £ 271,000 on average , marking the strongest annual increase seen in @entity53 prices since 2010			1
@entity53 remains the only @entity5 nation where prices are now higher than their pre-crisis peak in 2008			2
the average house price in the @entity5 hit £ 260,000 in april , more than double the same time in 2002 in @entity17 , prices are up 18.7 per cent , twice the national @entity5 rate of 9.9 per cent the house price index for @entity17 is now sitting 31.6 per cent above the pre-financial crisis peak reached for the @entity53 capital in 2008			1
the figures add to a slew of reports which point to house prices continuing on a strong upward march , despite some estate agents suggesting that in recent weeks sellers have started to flood the market			2
further steps could be recommended by the @entity75 to calm the market , which could include diluting the government 's flagship help to buy scheme to help buyers with low deposits			2
chancellor @entity81 last week warned that high deposits mean many young families are struggling to get on to the property ladder critics of the scheme have argued it has been adding to the pressure on demand for homes and helping to fuel sellers ' price expectations as consumers ' confidence in the economy improves generally			0
chancellor @entity81 used his @entity97 speech last week to defend action to help people struggling to raise a deposit			0
‘ the average deposit required for a first time buyer is a staggering four fifths of annual income , ’ he said			2
and in a swipe at the @entity107 financiers in the audience , he added : ‘ i suspect almost everyone in this room owns their own home			0
‘ but i ask this : how many of you could have afforded the kind of deposit on your first house that many young families are expected to provide today ? very few of you			0
‘ let ’s be clear : the market is not functioning normally			0
and that ’s why we ’ve introduced @entity123			0
‘ i want to make sure an entire generation does n’t miss out on the reasonable aspiration to buy a home			0
’ he unveiled plans to give the @entity75 new powers to limit the amount people can borrow			0
new rules will cap the size of loans to a multiple of the borrower 's earnings , meaning that in areas where prices are rising by more than locals earn in a year , it will become even harder to buy a home @entity142 , chief executive of charity shelter , said the latest figures are evidence that ' house prices are spinning further out of control '			1
he continued : ' worryingly , as house prices continue to rise , some will be tempted to overstretch themselves in a frantic bid to get on the property ladder			0
' but with interest rates currently at historic lows , it 's a real concern that many might find themselves struggling to make ends meet in the future			0
' thousands of people are working hard and saving , now @entity159 must meet them halfway by building the genuinely affordable homes they desperately need			0
