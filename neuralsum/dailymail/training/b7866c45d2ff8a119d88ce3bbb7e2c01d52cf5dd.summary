by @entity1 reporter published : 03:08 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 10:35 est , 25 may 2012 a secret east @entity3 - style rescue package is being cooked up by @entity4 as the eurozone 's ' engine - room ' desperately bids to save the single currency			1
@entity3 chancellor @entity8 is preparing a six - point plan that aims to revive @entity10 in the same way @entity4 was developed after the fall of @entity13			1
@entity14 reports that it will see ailing countries transformed through privatisations , soft investment rules and the relaxation of employment laws			1
hit : @entity20 , led by @entity21 ( left ) , and @entity4 , led by @entity8 ( right ) are usually known as the engine - room of the eurozone , but are now also suffering from the economic slowdown the @entity25 will be presented with the plan , including a proposal for a @entity29 privatisation agency or fund , in the next few weeks			1
it is likely to provoke outrage in @entity10 because of it 's ' behave more like the @entity3 ' message			2
it is modelled on the ' trust agency ' @entity37 , created in 1990 by the @entity38 of @entity4 to sell off 8,500 state enterprises			0
@entity8 also wants to create special economic zones that will tempt foreign investors with tax relief and reduced regulation			0
the employment market would also be restructured along @entity3 lines , with a job protection loosened			0
the leaking of the plans comes as it was revealed @entity20 and @entity4 , dubbed the eurozone 's engine - room , is now being hit by @entity29 's economic slowdown			1
worry : the news that @entity4 and @entity20 is also suffering from the economic slowdown gives added urgency to the region 's struggle to keep @entity10 's debt crisis from tearing the single currency apart so far , the 17 - nation bloc 's downturn has been confined mainly to its periphery - with @entity10 , @entity62 and @entity63 all seeking bailouts			1
but an index measuring broad economic activity across the monetary union in may showed its weakest outcome since mid- 2009 , during the global financial crisis			0
it has given added urgency to the region 's struggle to keep @entity10 's debt crisis from tearing the single currency apart			1
@entity10 's general election on june 17 has turned into a referendum on whether @entity74 should continue with an austerity drive that is the price of continued fiscal support from its euro partners			1
@entity10 's anti-bailout leftist @entity79 party is maintaining a lead ahead of the elections , according to an opinion poll yesterday			1
@entity10 held elections on may 6 but that vote left parliament divided evenly between groups of parties that support and oppose austerity conditions attached to a € 130billion rescue agreed with lenders in march			2
the @entity93 / @entity92 poll showed @entity79 leading with 30 per cent of the vote , four points ahead of the conservative @entity78 , which is backing the bailout			0
if repeated on june 17 , this would fall short of enabling @entity79 to govern alone but give it a decisive role in forming a new government			0
@entity10 's deficit means that without the @entity25 / @entity103 money , which would stop flowing if @entity74 were to tear up the agreement on reforms , it would not be able to pay salaries and would have to leave the eurozone and start printing its own currency			1
' regardless of the turmoil and the debate that 's going on in these crucial countries , it would seem that for the time being , people want to stick with the euro , ' said @entity116 , senior vice president of global public affairs at @entity118			2
yesterday 's composite @entity119 indicated core nations such as @entity4 and @entity20 were also being caught up in the downturn			1
this was as they made contingency plans to deal with financial and economic turmoil in the event @entity10 quits the euro			2
@entity127 , which could be on the front line of speculative attacks on euro markets if @entity10 went back to the drachma , put a brave face on the situation , saying the most probable outcome was still that @entity10 would remain in the euro zone			2
' anything can happen , but i think the most probable outcome is the one which is most positive for @entity10 and for all of us , ' @entity127 prime minister @entity136 told @entity127 tv			0
he said @entity10 's eurozone partners had been wrong to insist on overly rapid reforms and fiscal adjustment , and he did not expect it would be long before @entity29 countries were ready to introduce common euro zone bonds			1
' @entity127 is very much in favour of the creation of euro bonds when the time is right , and we do not expect it to be too far off , ' @entity136 told an earlier news conference			2
at least half of eurozone governments , as well as banks and large companies , are making contingency plans in case @entity10 decides to quit the euro			2
despite @entity136 's comments , his deputy economy minister said @entity162 was ready for such a possibility			0
and @entity29 markets are currently stable			0
the @entity165 is 0.05 per cent up at 5,352.93 ; @entity20 's @entity166 is 0.41 per cent up at 3,050.58 ; and @entity4 's @entity167 is 0.43 per cent at 6,343.35			1
it came as yesterday the euro crashed to a 22 - month low as the @entity29 economy took another dramatic turn for the worse			0
figures showed the biggest slump in private sector business across @entity29 this month for nearly three years			1
the dire news sent the euro tumbling against the dollar to $ 1.25 – its lowest level since july 2010			0
against the pound it was worth little more than 80p			0
figures from financial research group @entity182 showed the eurozone economy sank deeper into the mire this month			0
in @entity4 , the private sector was in decline for the first time in six months while in @entity20 the slump was the steepest for just over three years			1
common euro bonds , which would allow weaker nations like @entity10 to borrow with the collective backing of the bloc , have been placed back on the agenda as @entity10 's possible exit looms larger			1
and the topic has seemingly split @entity20 and @entity4			2
@entity20 's election on may 6 of a @entity198 president , @entity21 , has changed the tone of the debate on euro bonds			1
he urged a reluctant @entity3 chancellor @entity8 and other @entity29 leaders at talks on wednesday to consider recourse to euro bonds among other measures			2
@entity8 , seen as an architect of the austerity prescription for @entity10 , now looks increasingly vulnerable on the eurozone crisis			2
other @entity29 leaders have rallied around @entity21 's call for a new emphasis on growth alongside debt - cutting			2
surprise : meanwhile , away from the eurozone crisis , @entity20 president @entity21 made an unannounced trip to @entity218 today trip : @entity21 visited some of the @entity20 troops he wanted to pull out later this year on euro bonds , @entity4 's opposition @entity222 ( @entity223 ) and @entity224 have taken a similar line to @entity21			1
but there were signs yesterday they might instead accept a compromise plan to mutualise only a proportion of members ' sovereign debts			0
this would involve mutualising the debts of euro zone countries beyond 60 percent of gdp			0
the euro crisis has also thrown a spotlight on the vulnerability of commercial banks to a full - blown crisis of confidence in the single currency , especially in the indebted countries of southern @entity29 , such as @entity245			1
@entity245 is considering creating a single nationalised bank out of its failed lenders , including problem lender @entity250 , if the state can not find buyers for state - rescued banks , a senior @entity247 source said			1
@entity250 , which was part - nationalised just two weeks ago , is also to ask @entity254 for £ 12billion in bailout cash			0
meanwhile , away from the eurozone crisis , @entity20 president @entity21 made an unannounced trip to @entity218 today			0
he visited some of the @entity20 troops he wants to pull out later this year and meet @entity218 president @entity258 , whom he saw briefly last week in @entity259			0
@entity21 , making a whirl of foreign trips since his may 15 inauguration , is accelerating the withdrawal of the roughly 3,400 @entity20 troops still stationed in @entity218 to the end of this year , two years ahead of the @entity267 timetable			0
his office said he would pledge to keep to a long - term cooperation treaty signed with @entity270 earlier this year			0
@entity21 's new withdrawal timetable is at odds with @entity267 partners adhering to a plan to hand over command of all combat missions to @entity218 forces by the middle of 2013 and withdraw most of the 130,000 foreign troops there by the end of 2014 .			0

@entity4 's private sector worryingly in decline for first time in six months
@entity20 's slump in same sector is the steepest for just over three years
