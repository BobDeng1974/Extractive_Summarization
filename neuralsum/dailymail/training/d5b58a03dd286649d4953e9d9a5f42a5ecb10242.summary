@entity19 has a history of drug use going back many years and is being prescribed methadone to try to rid her of the habit , ms @entity50 told the court			2
a child 's beaker with methadone was left on a set of drawers in his parents ’ bedroom where he also slept , so it would be ‘ within easy reach ’ of his mother , ms @entity50 alleged			1
@entity19 awoke to find @entity12 unconscious in bed next to her and called 999 on march 13 last year			1
she described her son to police as ‘ a gorgeous little boy ’ and a ‘ loveable rogue who got up to the usual mischief ’ , the court heard			0
parents : @entity21 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) outside @entity35 , where the pair denied the manslaughter of two - year - old @entity12 and cruelty to a person under the age of 16 ‘ not only would ( the beaker ) have attracted him to it like a little bee to a honeypot but it was also within easy reach of him , ’ she said			1
