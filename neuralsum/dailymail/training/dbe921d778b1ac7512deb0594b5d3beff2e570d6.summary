it was smiles all round at the family barbecue as @entity3 hugged his fiancee @entity4 and grinned at his father @entity5			1
but @entity3 was unaware that @entity4 was hiding a terrible secret – for the past few weeks she had been sleeping with his dad			1
adding insult to injury , father and son had only recently reconciled after spending nearly eight years apart - and it was @entity4 who had engineered their meeting			1
but just six months after meeting @entity5 , @entity4 found herself falling for the 43 - year - old builder and into his bed			1
family affair : @entity3 and his fiancee @entity4 celebrate their engagement party in june last year			1
unbeknown to @entity3 , @entity4 was having an affair with his father @entity5 ( left ) the 27 - year - old from @entity23 , @entity24 , struggled with choosing between her fiancé and her future father - in - law			1
she said : ' standing beside @entity3 at that barbeque in june 2011 was torture			1
'' i felt such a fraud knowing that while i was on the arm of my fiance , it was his old man who i had fallen for			2
' sometimes i lie in bed and cry because it ’s horrible what i did to him , but on the other hand i found it impossible to control the feelings i had towards his dad			0
' it was in december 2009 that @entity4 first fell for labourer @entity3 , 21			1
@entity4 , who works in sales , said : ' when i met @entity3 at a @entity47 party he seemed lovely			1
' he put his hand on my knee and said : " i think you ’re the most beautiful girl in the world and i really , really mean that			0
" moments later our lips had locked and we were kissing			0
' after a few dates i realised he was special			0
he treated me with respect , was always the perfect gentleman and our sex life was fantastic			0
' after two months of dating he ’d all but moved in and four months later he proposed with the words : " i want you to say yes because i ’ve never loved a girl as much as i love you , and i want to make you happy for the rest of your life			0
" ' my eyes filled with tears and i said yes			0
' ultimate betrayal : @entity4 and @entity5 , both from @entity23 , @entity24 , now plan to move in together but thinking about their upcoming marriage made @entity4 realise she was yet to meet his whole family			1
she said : ' the one person i had n’t met was @entity3 ’s dad - they had n’t been close since his parents split eight years earlier			1
' i saw our engagement as a way of bridging the gap and bringing them together			0
i was determined our wedding would bring them closer			0
' when we knocked on his door @entity5 answered and i was confronted by a man who looked ten years younger than his 43 years and was very handsome			1
ashamed with herself : @entity4 describes her split from @entity3 as ' heartbreaking ' ' he invited us in and was charming and confident			1
i was instantly attracted to him , not in a sexual way , but i fell in love with his personality			0
' we all became very close after that meeting and went out for drinks and to clubs together			0
' a year ago @entity3 and i were at @entity5 ’s house after a saturday night out			1
@entity5 and i were drunk but @entity3 was sober as he was on call for work , in case the alarm went off			1
' we ’d only been in five minutes when @entity3 got a call out			1
he phoned from work ten minutes later to say there ’d been a break in and he would n’t be home for a few hours			0
' i told him i would sleep in the spare room at his dad 's , as i did n’t fancy going home on my own			0
@entity105 sat with @entity5 on the sofa with a glass of wine , and suddenly he turned to me and said : " i do n’t think i ’ve ever seen you looking this attractive			1
" ' i was shocked , told him to stop it and pulled my short skirt down as it had accidentally ridden up			0
but he put his hand on my thigh			0
' i turned to him and suddenly we kissed , but then i thought about @entity3 and stopped him , saying : " this is n’t right , it is n’t fair on @entity3			1
" his face dropped and he said : " you ’re right			0
" ' i decided the best thing to do was go to the spare room , get undressed and into bed			0
as i lay under the covers the initial adrenalin rush had been replaced by fear			0
' what was i playing at ? i loved @entity3 , he was the perfect man for me			1
' but underneath i knew i was attracted to @entity5			1
i wanted him and not @entity125 , and the thought made my blood run cold			0
' how could i ever admit that to @entity3 ? what sort of person would that make me ? i was scared , terrified of what the future held			1
that kiss had made me realise i was with the wrong person			0
' @entity5 appeared at my bedroom door and sat on the bed : " i ’m really sorry for what happened just now			1
please do n’t tell @entity3 , he must never find out			1
" ' my emotions were all over the place , i pulled him towards me and we started kissing and minutes later we were having sex			0
' when it had finished @entity5 went back to his room and i lay on the bed in a complete state of shock			1
' there was no going back now			0
but i felt so guilty and ashamed , ashamed that i ’d betrayed @entity3 who was such a genuine person			1
' i ’d been cheated on in the past so i knew what it felt like , and now i was no better than them			0
' but i could n’t stop thinking about @entity5 , i could n’t see a way of having him without causing massive heartbreak			1
' i started to cry , i could n’t see what i was going to do			0
as they were : @entity3 claims he will never speak to his father again while he is in a relationship with @entity4 ' an hour later @entity3 came home , but i could n’t look him in the eye			1
i ’d betrayed the man i thought i loved			0
' for the next three months i saw @entity5 when @entity3 was n’t around , and tried to carry on as though nothing had happened			1
' i was an emotional wreck			0
i ’d gone from wanting to spend the rest of my life with @entity3 to being unable to be intimate with him because i did n’t love him			1
' it was heart - breaking			0
i wanted to reset the clock and go back to how things were before all this happened , but i could n’t			0
' telling @entity3 the truth would mean he lost his dad again , and he ’d be unable to forgive me			1
if @entity3 and i ate tea together i ’d suddenly well up and have to rush out of the kitchen so @entity3 did n’t see me in tears			2
' during all of this turmoil , @entity3 was planning the couple ’s wedding			2
@entity4 said : ' he ’d taken over planning the wedding because i was showing little interest			2
' but i still could n’t choose between them			0
i loved @entity5 and could see a future with him but @entity3 deserved better than that , so i stuck it out			1
' after three months of this charade i became so exhausted i told @entity5 we had to come clean			2
@entity5 panicked and said : " you ca n’t , he ’ll never speak to me again			2
" ' but i knew this was the right thing to do , i could never end things with @entity5 now			2
' @entity5 and i met at his house and @entity3 joined us			1
he knew something was wrong and asked : " is everything ok ? " ' i took @entity3 ’s hand and said : " i ’m really sorry , but for the past few months i ’ve been seeing your dad			2
i really like you but i do n’t love you			0
" ' @entity3 laughed , thinking i was joking			2
but when i walked up to @entity5 , took his hand and started to cry , @entity3 ’ face dropped			1
' he threw himself at @entity5 and they started fighting			2
eventually @entity3 marched to the front door and screamed : " i hope you two will be happy together , in hell ! " ' the guilt and betrayal i felt towards him made me feel sick			2
i lost lots of weight , could n’t eat , did n’t want to go out and sank into depression			0
' but i think i have made the right decision by choosing @entity5 , my future is with him now			2
' to drag things on with @entity3 would ’ve been crueller than doing what i did and i ’ve come to terms with that now			2
' @entity5 and i have been together , properly , for five months now and are hoping to move in together this year			2
' @entity5 ’s hoping to patch things up with @entity3 but i ’m not holding my breath			1
we have n’t spoken since the fight , but i hope one day we can all be friends again			0
' @entity5 claimed the couple are ' really happy ' together			2
he said : ' it ’s a shame what ’s happened and i did n’t want to hurt @entity3 , but at the end of the day i ’ve found @entity4 and that ’s what counts			1
' @entity3 will find someone else , he ’s a good - looking lad and i hope one day we can be friends again			2
' @entity3 said : ' i ’m getting over it			2
but i still think it ’s a nasty thing to do			0
' i feel quite embarrassed about it			0
i do n’t know if i ’ll ever be friends with my dad again , well definitely not while he ’s with her			0
' i ’ve just got to get over it and i am			0
