' when i discovered what happened i was shocked and disgusted			2
the smell was unbelievable and there were flies everywhere			0
the shocking pictures taken by mrs @entity1 's daughter are too disturbing to use			1

we regret we did n't know about it until december 17 when mrs @entity16 told us			0

we are very sorry but we would n't like to cloud the fact there are really good care workers looking after vulnerable adults every day			0

the carer ( not pictured ) appears to have ignored her desperate condition her family say the carer failed to notice she was in severe pain and was unable to move from the sofa in a statement , @entity24 said : ' both @entity24 and @entity26 had assessed and were aware of the existing very poor state of @entity128 and mrs @entity1 ’s home and the extent of the care needs the couple already required before our care worker started to support the couple			1
' our care worker was contracted by the @entity26 to attempt to clean and maintain the house , but , at the couple ’s request , was not allowed to provide personal care such as assisting mrs @entity1 ’s mobility or hygiene requirements			1
' @entity24 does n’t have the authority to determine or change the level of care provided to individuals by local authorities , but we are sorry that we were not able to reduce the obvious discomfort and distress that @entity128 and mrs @entity1 and their family experienced			2
' the local authority is responsible for deciding and reviewing care needs and only contracted @entity24 to make some limited progress in preventing further deterioration in the state of the couple ’s home , which we were able to do			2
' on reflection and despite our limited role , we recognise that we , as well as the council , could have escalated the situation more quickly , and we have now jointly agreed more effective ways to raise concerns in this sort of extremely difficult and sensitive case			0
