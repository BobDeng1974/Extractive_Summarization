@entity1 , 31 , downed vodka , beer and wine at a friend 's birthday party before kissing and groping a 12 - year - old boy on a bench			1
she then performed a lap - dance and straddled a group of teenage boys			1
the part - time cleaner also bit a 13 - year - old boy on his neck and persuaded him to perform a sex act on her			1
the mother - of - three denied four counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual assault but was found guilty following a two - week trial in october at @entity33			1
today , judge @entity34 said he did not believe the incident on november 29 , 2011 , ' arose out of paedophilia ' but was a ' one - off '			2
@entity1 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , was given a two - year prison sentence suspended for two years at @entity41			1
judge @entity42 said the three boys had made a full recovery ' from what could have been extraordinarily traumatic experiences '			2
however , he told @entity1 she ' should be ashamed ' of herself for pleading not guilty as he said the quantity of alcohol she had drunk meant she could not dispute the testimony of the boys			2
he told the court : ' it is a highly unusual and very difficult case			0
' i 'm satisfied that this behaviour arose not out of paedophilia , although these were paedophile acts , but out of drunkenness , selfishness and a real element of childishness on your part			0
' you were grossly disinhibited but i do n't think that in you there is a tendency or proclivity towards this sort of behaviour and because of this i can regard it as a one - off			0
' the aggravating features are the age of the children , the presence of other children during the offending itself and the fact that you were drunk and out of control			0
' it is right to say that they show that the major impact on the children came from all of this coming to light and the embarrassment and difficulties that caused them at the time			0
' he said the victims had made it clear they were ' over whatever trauma ' they felt when they made statements in april 2012			0
judge @entity42 told @entity1 she should ' be ashamed of herself ' for pleading not guilty but said he was satisfied it was a ' one - off ' as he gave a her suspended prison sentence at @entity98 @entity97 the judge added : ' it is because and only because of the victim impact statements and the impact of the sentence to be served upon your children that i think it is appropriate to step back and suspend the sentence			1
' during the trial , the court heard @entity1 could not remember parts of the night she attended the party near @entity113 , because of the ' extraordinary ' amount of alcohol she had consumed			2
@entity116 , defending , said her client had ' very significant gaps in her memory '			0
judge @entity42 criticised @entity1 for her ' out - of - control ' actions			1
he told her : ' the evidence established very clearly that on that night you got paralytically drunk and that your behaviour with some children passed beyond the flirtatious to the point where you touched them indecently			0
' this was a significant and serious offence			0
' you fought the case and you should frankly be ashamed of yourself for refusing to accept that your memory of the matter was such that you really could n't dispute what the boys consistently said			0
' @entity1 was acquitted of a sixth charge of sexual activity with a child			2
she was also ordered to sign the @entity137 for ten years .			1
