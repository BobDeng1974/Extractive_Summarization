@entity0 will undergo a scan on his injured knee on wednesday while the rest of the @entity5 team - mates get ready for their @entity6			1
@entity0 missed tuesday night 's 2 - 1 win against @entity8 after banging into an advertising hoarding at the end of their previous match with @entity13 , and manager @entity14 is now waiting to see if his captain can make their next match at @entity18 on monday			1
' we will have to wait until wednesday to say anything about him ( @entity0 ) because you never know with the knee , ' said @entity24			1
' in addition , record signing @entity41 is due to miss the trip to the south coast with a hamstring injury			2
' @entity25 is not so heavy but of course he shall not play against @entity18 but you never know , ' added @entity14 , who has also confirmed @entity50 international @entity49 may be able to return by the end of the month after suffering a knee injury on international duty with @entity54			1
' in december we will see light at the end of the tunnel , ' smiled the @entity5 boss			2
@entity0 will still hope to attend @entity5 's @entity6 bash which will be held in good cheer after the club 's fourth win in a row			1
@entity66 's free - kick goes all the way in to give @entity5 a 2 - 1 lead in the second half @entity66 ( left ) is jumped on by @entity70 as @entity71 runs to join in the celebrations without @entity0 , @entity25 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and other injured players , @entity5 are digging deep to @entity24 's delight			1
' the fighting spirit is fantastic when you see the team , and that is why the fans are also excited , ' he said			0
' we have come back from bad results many times and against @entity8 the referee should have whistled at 1 - 0 ( when @entity89 challenged @entity28 ) but he did n't and they scored			1
but we fought back again and fought til the end when we also had the long balls to @entity93 ( @entity95 ) @entity94 , and we have survived			0
' it is good for the players , the team and for me , and the party we have tomorrow ! ' ' i was not happy with the performance in the first half , we were not aggressive enough , and the last few moments were not necessary			0
' @entity24 was referring to a late @entity8 surge which saw the previously underused @entity105 make saves from @entity107 and @entity108 before @entity107 struck @entity70 on the goal - line			2
goalkeeper @entity105 celebrates @entity28 's opening goal on tuesday night at @entity30 @entity8 captain @entity111 ( right ) appears dejected after the final whistle @entity8 boss @entity113 thought @entity5 's winner , scored from @entity66 's free - kick when it brushed over the head of @entity117 , should have been ruled out			1
' we were disappointed obviously with the award of the second goal , from our point of view we clearly thinks it 's offside , ' he said			0
' the lad @entity117 , it does n't matter if he does n't touch it , he is clearly interfering with play			0
he was ahead of the play in an offside position , so the referee and the assistant - referee should have cancelled that out			2
so that is disappointing for us , but we did n't allow that disappointment to effect us			0
we went again and the episodes at the end were unbelievable			0
it is the luck we have been having at the moment			0
' and let 's give @entity105 credit , they were outstanding saves at the end			0
