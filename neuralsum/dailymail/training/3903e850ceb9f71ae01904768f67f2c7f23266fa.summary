a sea exploration company said today it has discovered yet another @entity2 wartime ship filled with silver , which is lying 8,000ft beneath the surface of the @entity5			2
@entity6 hit the headlines earlier this month by discovering the @entity9 - era @entity8 and its £ 155million haul of silver on the ocean floor			1
today the company proudly announced that it found the remains of the @entity2 @entity15 , a first world war - era ship that sank on february 9 , 1917			1
spooky sight : the @entity6 's @entity19 inspection of the @entity15 site , showing the promenade railings excellent condition : despite being sent to the bottom in 1917 , and suffering the ravages of salt water and pressure , the @entity23 is literally in ship shape at the bottom of the @entity5 open the hatches : @entity6 intends to return in the spring to mine both the @entity23 and the @entity8 around 100 miles away like the @entity8 but decades before , the @entity15 fell victim to a @entity34 submarine , u- 81			1
an @entity6 spokesman said the @entity23 was insured to carry silver worth £ 110,000 when it sailed in 1917			1
that value would mean the ship could hold as much as 600,000 ounces of silver , based on silver prices in 1917			1
at current market prices , that much silver would be worth more than £ 12million			1
@entity6 will retain 80 per cent of the value of the silver that 's recovered			2
precious cargo : the @entity15 , which was sunk by a @entity34 submarine in 1917 in the @entity5 , carrying silver the company is planning a recovery expedition next spring			1
it said its share of the proceeds will contribute significantly to funding its future operations			2
the shipwreck is about 100 miles away from the @entity8 which sank in 1941 carrying a reported cargo of up to 7 million ounces of silver			2
treasure hunter : @entity6 's @entity60 , which is bristling with hi - tech gadgets , has hit pay dirt twice - first with the @entity8 and now with the @entity15 the @entity8 was steaming home from @entity64 while in the service of the @entity67 when she was torpedoed by a @entity69 u-boat			1
she sank in icy seas more than three miles deep about 300 miles south west of @entity71			0
only one of her 84 crew survived			0
eerie : a ladder leads down to the cargo hold on the @entity8 as it lies on the sea bed 300 miles south of @entity78 well preserved : a brass part of the @entity8 is in good condition , suggesting that the cargo is also undamaged by its time beneath the waves sea bed : a sonar image of the @entity8 , sunk by @entity34 u-boat in 1941 in what is believed to be the deepest and largest ever retrieval of a precious cargo , the firm will next spring dive to recover a haul estimated to be worth £ 155million			1
the 412 - ft steamship is sitting upright on the seabed , with its holds open			0
@entity6 said a robot submersible captured video footage showing tea chests , a sign that the heavier consignment of silver was underneath			2
@entity100 : the ship , which was torpedoed after breaking away from a convoy , was carrying silver uncovered : an intact toilet sits on the bridge deck of the @entity8 sunk : the @entity8 was a steel - hulled @entity2 cargo steamship that began her career in 1919 under the service of the @entity110 of @entity111 pick - up : odyssey crew will use remotely operated vehicles to get to the wreck and unload its precious cargo ' this should enable us to unload the cargo through the hatches , ’ chief executive @entity118 added			1
the @entity8 is so deep the usual steel cable used in the grab mechanisms will have to be replaced by synthetic fibres			0
the ship , recognisable by the red - and - black paintwork of the @entity110 and the torpedo hole in its side , was sailing in a convoy from @entity131 in 1941			0
buffeted by high winds and running low on coal , the captain decided he would not make it to @entity136 and broke from the convoy to head for @entity78			0
a single torpedo from @entity138 sank her in 20 minutes , on february 17 , 1941			0
three lifeboats were launched , but only second officer @entity141 made it to land , reaching the @entity144 coast after 13 days			0
@entity6 said yesterday the @entity2 government was ‘ desperately looking for new sources of income ’ and was urging it to find more @entity2 wrecks			0
it is also investigating @entity149 , lost off @entity150 with 10 tons of gold in 1694 , and @entity152 , a precursor to @entity154 ’s flagship			0
in 2008 a @entity156 judge ordered the firm to hand back gold and silver coins worth £ 300million to @entity160 , which said the treasure was taken from a frigate that sank in 1804			1
@entity6 said the wreck ’s identity was unclear and had been found in international waters			0
gaping : the torpedo hole in the @entity8 , where the @entity169 captain 's log reported the ship was struck			0

@entity15 went down in 1917 with £ 12m of silver aboard
both ships sunk by @entity34 submarines , but in different world wars
