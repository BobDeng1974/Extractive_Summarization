by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 midfielder @entity2 can resonate exactly with what @entity4 are going through in terms of a rebuilding job this season after going through similar at @entity9 last term			1
the 23 - year - old was one of a host of summer signings to arrive at @entity3 last summer in an attempt to fill the gap of star man @entity17 last summer			1
but things did n't quite pan as @entity3 would have liked as they yet again finished outside of the @entity20 places , despite spending Â£ 110million on a number of new additions			2
similarities : @entity2 believes @entity3 and @entity4 have gone through near identical transitions celebrations : after a superb start to the season @entity2 and co will be eyeing a top four spot at @entity3 this year @entity4 have splashed the cash this summer with a number of new additions in the hope of filling the void of star man @entity35 who joined @entity38 giants @entity37			1
but @entity2 says there is no guarantee of instant success when so many players are brought in such a short space of time telling @entity45 : ' it is true that we went through [ what @entity4 are now facing ] last year			1
it will depend on what team they have and what the new players are bringing in			0
' sometimes you are lucky and sometimes you are a bit unlucky			0
last year we made some really good signings , i think			0
' we were just a bit unlucky that nothing really ended up in a big thing			0
of course , that can happen with @entity4 as well so sometimes you are lucky and sometimes you are n't			0
' spurs will look to extend their 100 % start to the season when they entertain @entity68 ' side on sunday , who in turn will be be looking to get back to winning ways after losing 3 - 1 against champions @entity72 on monday night .			2
