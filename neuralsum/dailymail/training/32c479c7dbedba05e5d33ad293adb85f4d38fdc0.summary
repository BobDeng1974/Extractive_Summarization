by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 08:20 est , 11 june 2013 the misery of camping in the great @entity4 summertime could soon be a thing of a past - provided you 're prepared to hang from a tree			0
an @entity9 company has developed a waterproof ' sky tent ' that avoids the rain , bugs and sleeping on a cold , hard floor			1
it is made from nylon parachute material and is tied up using climbing ropes or carabiners - and can help campers avoid hazards such as flooding , muddy terrain and wildlife			1

it keeps out small bugs and also resists rips and tears			0
the netting can also reduce the wind chill factor dimensions : 138inch - by - 73inch - 43inch weight : @entity48 storage : @entity50 can hold @entity51 and any sized hammock oversized 75 denier polyurethane - coated rain fly no - see - @entity55 @entity56 @entity58 @entity57 100in of cord at four corners secures rain fly to the ground 80inch of 6mm climbing rope to attach the tent to trees plus 138inch of climbing rope secures adjustable ridge line @entity68 ( optional ) the @entity26 2 , made by @entity27 - based @entity25 , sleeps two people in hammocks and can can fit two hammocks inside - one above the other - for couples to share			1
an oversized raincover protects campers from the rain while netting on both sides of the tent keeps out small bugs			2
the @entity80 's ripstop nylon base layer also helps keep in body heat and is sturdy and waterproof enough if campers want to pitch the @entity26 on the ground			1
a @entity84 knot helps support the tent but is also adjustable so campers can change the size of the @entity26 2 's ridgeline			2
backpacks and clothes can also be hung from the hammocks rope to keep them off the ground , and secure			1
designers @entity93 and @entity95 are shown in their @entity26 2 on the @entity96 near that @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99			0
their weight is supported by the hammocks and not the surrounding tent			1
the hammock ropes can also be used to hang personal belongings from the features of the @entity80			1
it comes with 100 inches of climbing rope that supports the rain fly			2
the tent itself is suspended using a separate 80inch rope @entity80 is designed to be suspended around the hammock but it is not attached to it			1
this means a camper 's body weight and gear weight are supported by the sturdy hammock ropes and the tree straps , rather than onto the @entity26 2			2
@entity80 is made by hammock designers @entity122 and @entity123 who own @entity25			1
the couple say the @entity51 is a ' relaxing and unusual way to camp			0
adding : ' @entity51 is a revolution in the making , bringing hammock camping to a new level of comfort and convenience			0
' the @entity26 2 costs £ 83 ( $ 130 ) but does n't include the hammocks			1
while we would prefer that you use @entity26 with a @entity25 hammock , it works equally well with most any parachute nylon hammock			0
the original @entity26 , which slept one person , was introduced in august of 2011 and costs £ 77			2
it used parachute nylon as the floor and had a fixed ridgeline			0
although the @entity51 can sleep two people , it can also be used by single camper - giving that person extra room			2
the nylon base means that the tent can be switched between being suspended from the trees and being pitched on the ground this image shows the @entity26 2 being used in @entity151 , above @entity152 , @entity27			1
as long as there are two trees , or similar structures , to secure the tent to it can be used above any terrain			2
the @entity26 2 costs £ 83 ( $ 130 ) but does n't include the hammocks campers without hammocks can alternatively buy the floating tent , which launched last month			1
architect @entity164 , 36 , invented the bizarre tents which are designed to be suspended at chest height , with three ties attaching them to trees , pulled tightly			0
although they may look flimsy , each three - man tent is designed to support almost two tonnes in weight - so there 's no danger of falling back to earth with a bump in the middle of the night			0
the clever design is based on the same pattern that a spider uses to build its web - building support up from a series of three points			0
for £ 820 , campers can experience their very own floating holiday			0
this camp of three floating tents is completely off the ground			0
they can sleep three people and were designed by architect @entity164 each three - man floating tent is designed to support almost two tonnes in weight			2
the design is based on the same pattern that a spider uses to build its web - building support up from a series of three points in may , the @entity197 at @entity198 , @entity199 introduced another alternative ' tree tent ' that looks like a futuristic orb hovering above the ground			2
it is suspended three metres above the forest floor from a series of ropes attached to a woodland canopy and sleeps two adults			1
it has a luxurious double bed that folds up to create a bench seat , led lighting and even space for a woodburning stove			0
a wooden walkway leads campers up to the oval front door of the quirky tent , which is suspended in mid-air by eight spider - like ropes attached to surrounding trees			1
the frame is made from @entity4 ash wood sourced from local forests and recycled aluminium , with a cover made entirely from waterproof cotton			0
this futuristic orb might look like a @entity231 as it hovers high above the ground but it is actually the country 's first ' tree tent ' the futuristic orb - shaped ' tree tents ' are attached to a camouflaged woodland canopy and eight spider - like ropes attached to surrounding trees			1
a wooden walkway leads campers to an oval entrance the ' tree tents ' sleeps two adults			0
