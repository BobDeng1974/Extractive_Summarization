' i welcome the long overdue stand the @entity4 has taken and this landmark declaration			2
' mr @entity12 said : ' we need to shrink and eradicate safe havens for those responsible for war - zone rape and this is a step towards doing that			0
that training will be extended to peacekeeping groups of other nations			0
. he added : ' this is an absolutely crucial step , since members of armed forces are often the first to come into contact with survivors and could also have an important role to play in helping to change male attitudes			0
' now that we have put war - zone rape on the international agenda , it must never slip off it again and it must be given even greater prominence			0
' ending the 17th and @entity110 slave trade was deemed impossible and it was eradicated			0
all smiles : @entity2 and mr @entity12 are pictured outside @entity42 where @entity4 foreign ministers met today ' achieving global action against landmines , cluster munitions , climate change , was thought impossible , yet the world acts on these issues			1
' only two weeks ago we secured an international arms trade treaty , one that many people thought could never be adopted			0
