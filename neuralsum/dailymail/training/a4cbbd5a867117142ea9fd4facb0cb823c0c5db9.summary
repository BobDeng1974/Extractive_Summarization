astronomers have found evidence that intergalactic ' wind ' is stripping certain galaxies of the gas they need to form stars			1
the process was spotted in four galaxies as they fell into dense clusters of other galaxies			2
and the results could explain why some galaxies in clusters have so few young stars compared to others , like our own @entity15			1
astronomers from the @entity18 and the @entity19 have found direct evidence for galaxies being stripped of star - forming gas			1
pictured is one of the observed galaxies , @entity26 4522			0
the process occurs when a previously ' lonely ' galaxy falls into a cluster the research was carried out by astronomers from the @entity18 and the @entity19 using @entity32 's @entity31 and the @entity33			1
it was previously suggested that so - called ' field galaxies ' - those drifting through the universe alone - would have their gas stripped away if they moved into a galaxy cluster			1
but these results are the first time direct evidence for that theory has been found			1
earlier this month , @entity32 detected a surprising surplus of infrared light in the dark space between galaxies			0
baffled astronomers say the light was a diffuse cosmic glow as bright as all known galaxies combined			0
they believe it could be from orphaned stars flung out of galaxies			0
the findings redefine what scientists think of as galaxies , @entity32 said			0
galaxies may not have a set boundary of stars , but instead stretch out to great distances , forming a vast , interconnected sea of stars			2
the effect occurs as the previously single galaxy encounters a cloud of hot gas at the centre of the cluster			1
as it moves through this region at thousands of miles per second , the cloud acts as a wind and blows away the gas within the galaxy without disturbing its stars			2
the process is known as ram - pressure stripping			0
previously , astronomers had seen the very tenuous atomic hydrogen gas , that surrounds a galaxy , get stripped			1
but it was thought these denser , molecular hydrogen clouds , where stars can form , were resistant to the wind			0
' however , we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is also blown from the in - falling galaxy , much like smoke blown from a candle being carried into a room , ' said dr @entity91 of the @entity92 at the @entity18			1
amazingly , astronomers had previously spotted young stars lying in the wake of such field galaxies - providing indirect evidence for the ram - pressure stripping process			1
but now they have seen direct evidence of the molecular hydrogen itself , trailing in the wake of several galaxies			2
the research was carried out by astronomers using @entity32 's @entity31 ( illustration shown ) and the @entity33			0
it was previously suggested that so - called ' field galaxies ' would have their gas stripped away but this is the first direct evidence this image shows one of the observed galaxies , @entity113 137 - 001 , with a stream of gas trailing behind it			1
it 's believed that stars can actually form in this stream of material behind the galaxy as it heads through the centre of a cluster of other galaxies ' for more than 40 years we have been trying to understand why galaxies in dense clusters have so few young stars compared with ones like our @entity15 , but now we see the quenching of star formation in action , ' said professor @entity134 of the @entity19			1
' cutting off the gas that forms stars is a key step in the evolution of galaxies from the early universe to the present			2
' the results , published in the @entity143 , are from observations of four galaxies - @entity26 , @entity146 97 - 073 , @entity113 137 - 001 and ngc 1427a			0
the team made their analysis using optical , infrared and hydrogen - emission data from the @entity151 and @entity33 space telescopes , as well as ground - based data			0
' seeing this stripped molecular gas is like seeing a theory on display in the sky , ' said professor @entity158 , also from the @entity19			2
' astronomers have assumed that something stopped the star formation in these galaxies , but it is very satisfying to see the actual cause			0
' this remarkable image shows @entity166 - 2852 in the middle , a massive galaxy cluster not associated with this study			0
almost every object seen in the image is a galaxy , each containing billions of stars			0

astronomers from the @entity18 and the @entity19 have found direct evidence for galaxies being stripped of star - forming gas
the process occurs when a previously ' lonely ' galaxy falls into a cluster
if it passes near the hot gas at the centre it loses gas used to form stars
researchers spotted the process happening in four distant galaxies
could explain why some galaxies in the universe do *n't* have young stars
