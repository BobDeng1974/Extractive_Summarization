@entity0 has launched an incendiary attack on the @entity2 for ‘ adopting the language of the @entity4 ’ by branding a key welfare reform a ‘ bedroom tax ’			1
in a letter leaked to the @entity9 , the @entity7 accuses the corporation of helping to alarm hundreds of thousands of people in social housing who will be unaffected			1
in the strongest attack on its coverage by a minister since the coalition came to power , he says there has been ‘ persistent use ’ of the term ‘ bedroom tax ’ by @entity2 correspondents and on the @entity2 ’s news website , despite the phrase being ‘ innately political and indeed factually wrong ’			1
@entity0 slated the @entity2 for using the ' innately political ' and ' factually wrong ' term under the government ’s housing benefit reforms , which come into effect in april , working - age claimants in social housing who have more bedrooms than they require will see their handouts reduced			1
tenants affected will face a 14 per cent cut in housing benefit for the first excess bedroom , and 25 per cent where two or more bedrooms are unused			1
the government , which estimates the average affected household affected will lose £ 14 a week , says the policy will save taxpayers £ 500 million a year from the massive housing benefit bill			1
it will also encourage people to move into smaller properties to relieve pressure on stock , helping families crammed into homes that are too small , ministers say			2
mr @entity0 says the government is simply cutting what he calls a ‘ spare room subsidy ’ , but @entity4 has mounted a fierce campaign to oppose the move , branding it a ‘ bedroom tax ’			1
in a letter dated march 7 , to @entity59 , the acting head of @entity60 , the @entity7 insists : ‘ it is not a tax and it is wrong to describe it in this way			2
a tax , as the @entity67 makes clear , is a “ compulsory contribution to state revenue , levied by the government on worker ’s income and business profits or added to the cost of some goods , services and transactions ”			0
’ @entity78 is acting head of @entity60 and was sent the letter after @entity0 became enraged he goes on : ‘ what this policy does it reduce some social housing tenants ’ benefit if their home has one or more spare bedrooms			1
this can not in any way be described as a tax			0
the @entity2 gas a duty to inform the public			2
we believe that the @entity2 is failing in this duty and confusing members of the public on whether they might be “ taxed ”			2
‘ this is a public disservice			0
in using the word tax , the @entity2 has helped to worry those not in social housing that they might be taxed when this is not the policy			2
‘ it is also a term continually used and promoted by the @entity4			0
’ mr @entity0 says that the government has complained about the unquestioning use of the term before and been led to believe that the @entity2 , which has a statutory duty to be politically unbiased , accepted it was political and should not be used			1
but correspondents continue to use it , sometimes with the addition of the words ‘ critics call ’ or ‘ it ’s been called ’ , he complains			0
the @entity7 said he accepts the @entity2 is right to report that the @entity4 is calling the policy a tax , but insists its correspondents should make clear that the term is factually incorrect and innately political			1
‘ we do not believe it is the job of the @entity2 to use misleading terms and promote the views of the @entity4 , ’ he adds			2
‘ rather than doing this , you might care to devote some time to explaining what the government is trying to do – i ’m sure your audience would value this			0
’ he points out that on @entity132 , @entity131 presenter @entity130 talked about how the policy might impact disabled people and foster carers ‘ without even mention there is millions in support ’ for those groups			0
@entity140 carers and parents of serving armed forces personnel have since been exempted from welfare deductions			0
‘ nor have we heard any of the facts given to you by the department about the thousands of families in overcrowded accommodation or on waiting lists for a home , ’ mr @entity0 adds			1
‘ this is not simple debate about the “ branding ” of a policy			0
it is about factual accuracy , ensuring the public are properly informed , and being clear about the political nature of terminology that has gained common currency at the @entity2			1
‘ the public expects you to do better			0
’ a @entity2 spokesperson said : “ we can confirm that we have received a letter from @entity0 and we will respond directly in due course			1
” a @entity169 poll showed that 49 per cent of the public support the government ’s reforms , compared to 38 per cent against			0
@entity4 has opposed the welfare reform , but yesterday there was confusion as one shadow minister suggested it would support it when claimants refused to move to smaller properties			0
@entity181 culture minister @entity180 said : ‘ we have said that the bedroom tax should only apply if people have been offered a smaller place to live and turned it down , because obviously it ’s better to use housing stock more efficiently			0
’ a @entity4 spokesman insisted : ‘ we strongly oppose the bedroom tax and continue to do so			0
