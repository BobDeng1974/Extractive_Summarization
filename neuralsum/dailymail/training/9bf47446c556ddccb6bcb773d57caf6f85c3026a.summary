researchers have uncovered the history of @entity2 - and found it dates back far further than they expected			1
the research shows that filoviruses - a family to which @entity2 and its similarly lethal relative , @entity8 , belong - are at least 16 - 23 million years old			1
they say the discovery could help find new ways to create a vaccine			1
the new study is helping to rewrite @entity2 's family history			1
@entity23 likely existed in the @entity24 , and at that time , the evolutionary lines leading to @entity2 and @entity8 had already diverged , the study concludes			1
the research was published in the journal @entity28 in september			2
it adds to scientists ' developing knowledge about known filoviruses , which experts once believed came into being some 10,000 years ago , coinciding with the rise of agriculture			0
the new study pushes back the family 's age to the time when great apes arose			0
' @entity23 are far more ancient than previously thought , ' says lead researcher @entity40 , @entity41 , a @entity42 professor of biological sciences			0
' these things have been interacting with mammals for a long time , several million years			0
' according to the @entity28 article , knowing more about @entity2 and @entity8 's comparative evolution could ' affect design of vaccines and programs that identify emerging pathogens			1
' the research does not address the age of the modern - day ebola virus			2
instead , it shows that @entity2 and @entity8 are each members of ancient evolutionary lines , and that these two viruses last shared a common ancestor sometime prior to 16 - 23 million years ago			1
marburg virus disease ( @entity62 ) ( formerly known as @entity8 haemorrhagic fever ) was first identified in 1967 during epidemics in @entity8 and @entity65 in @entity66 and @entity67 in the former @entity68 from importation of infected monkeys from @entity71			1
@entity62 is a severe and highly fatal disease caused by a virus from the same family as the one that causes ebola virus disease			2
these viruses are among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans			0
both diseases are rare , but have a capacity to cause dramatic outbreaks with high fatality			0
illness caused by marburg virus begins abruptly , with severe headache and severe malaise			2
many patients develop severe haemorrhagic manifestations between days 5 and 7 , and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding , often from multiple sites			0
the marburg virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood , body fluids and tissues of infected persons			2
transmission of the marburg virus also occurred by handling ill or dead infected wild animals ( monkeys , fruit bats )			2
@entity40 and co-author @entity106 , phd , @entity42 professor of biological sciences , research viral ' fossil genes ' — chunks of genetic material that animals and other organisms acquire from viruses during infection			0
the first @entity2 outbreak in humans occurred in 1976 , and scientists still know little about the virus ' history			1
the same dearth of information applies to @entity8 , which was recognized in humans in 1967 and implicated in the death of a @entity71 health worker this month			1
understanding the virus ' ancient past could aid in disease prevention , @entity40 says			2
he notes that if a researcher were trying to create a single vaccine effective against both @entity2 and @entity8 , it could be helpful to know that their evolutionary lineages diverged so long ago			1
knowing more about filoviruses in general could provide insight into which host species might serve as ' reservoirs ' that harbor undiscovered pathogens related to @entity2 and @entity8 , @entity40 says			1
' when they first started looking for reservoirs for @entity2 , they were crashing through the rainforest , looking at everything — mammals , insects , other organisms , ' @entity40 says			1
' the more we know about the evolution of filovirus - host interactions , the more we can learn about who the players might be in the system			0
' in the new study , the authors report finding remnants of filovirus - like genes in various rodents			0
@entity2 ( pictured ) and @entity8 are each members of ancient evolutionary lines , and that these two viruses last shared a common ancestor sometime prior to 16 - 23 million years ago			1
one fossil gene , called @entity166 , appeared in the same spot in the genomes of four different rodent species : two hamsters and two voles			0
this meant the material was likely acquired in or before the @entity24 , prior to when these rodents evolved into distinct species some 16 - 23 million years ago			0
in other words : it appears that the known filovirus family is at least as old as the common ancestor of hamsters and voles			0
' these rodents have billions of base pairs in their genomes , so the odds of a viral gene inserting itself at the same position in different species at different times are very small , ' @entity40 says			0
' it 's likely that the insertion was present in the common ancestor of these rodents			0
' the genetic material in the @entity166 fossil was more closely related to @entity2 than to @entity8 , indicating that the lines leading to these viruses had already begun diverging from each other in the @entity24			1
the new study builds on @entity40 's previous work with @entity106 and other biologists , which used viral fossil genes to estimate that the entire family of filoviruses was more than 10 million years old			0
however , those studies used fossil genes only distantly related to @entity2 and @entity8 , which prevented the researchers from drawing conclusions about the age of these two viral lines			1
the current @entity28 publication fills this viral ' fossil gap , ' enabling the scientists to explore @entity2 's historical relationship with @entity215 .			2

found @entity2 is related to @entity8 , a lethal virus
@entity219 could help find new ways to create a vaccine
