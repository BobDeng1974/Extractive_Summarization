four down , two to go			0
on a miserable day for @entity1 men not called @entity2 , a defeated quartet beat quick retreats from the @entity5 with £ 108,000 between them			1
that was the reward for first - round failure for @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , all wildcards and £ 27,000 richer to a man			1
only @entity15 still has a chance to join @entity2 in the second round , but first the world no 234 must today face @entity19 , an @entity20 located 223 places higher up the ladder			1
one hugely unlikely result would change the perception , of course , but it would n’t address the annual question of whether these @entity1 men get more than they deserve			2
exit strategy : @entity9 and @entity10 were both first round losers at the @entity30 exception to the rule : @entity2 made a winning return in defence of his @entity30 title the point was underlined by the four winning only two sets between them , albeit there must be some mitigation for the quality of opposition , with @entity10 , ranked 214 , taking a set off world no 42 @entity44 in losing 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 3			1
@entity12 ’ result was particularly disappointing , the 24 - year - old losing 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 , 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 to @entity47 , the world no 118 from @entity49 , while @entity9 , the @entity1 no 3 , was crushed 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 by @entity50 , the 17th seed			2
@entity9 , 27 , who has now lost four of five first - round matches here , said the £ 27,000 prize money — up £ 3,500 on last year — was likely the difference between having a career and not , saying : ‘ if you have a coach or a trainer around you , obviously it becomes expensive to travel the world			1
but , it ’s a massive help			0
i ’m very grateful for the help i ’ve always received from the @entity5 and the @entity62			0
without that i would n’t be able to carry on playing probably			0
’ vital : @entity64 and @entity12 ( r ) might not be able to afford to play without @entity30 prize money unlikely : @entity15 is only other @entity1 male who can join @entity2 in the second round @entity12 , the @entity1 no 2 , appeared close to tears as he explained his defeat , but remains hopeful of ultimately cracking the top 100 , having indicated several years that he would leave the game by now if he failed to so			1
he said : ‘ if i was knocking 280 , that sort of ranking , i would n’t carry on			0
but i ’m beating some good players along the way			0
i ’ve got a decent chance ( of top 100 ) still			0
@entity11 , coached by @entity76 , lost 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 against @entity78 ’s @entity77 , and said : ‘ @entity1 players are not highly ranked which means everyone we ’re going to play , the opponent is expected to win			2
so that ’s why you see some early first - round exits			2

@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 lost in the first round at @entity30
the quartet will still pick up a total of £ 108,000 prize money between them
@entity2 was the exception after opening his defence with a *victory*
@entity15 is the only other @entity1 male who could join him
