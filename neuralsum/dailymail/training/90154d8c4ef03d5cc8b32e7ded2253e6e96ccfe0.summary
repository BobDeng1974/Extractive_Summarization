@entity7 decided the pensioner was dead after she stopped breathing even though there was still heart activity			1
he shunned a colleague ’s offer of a defibrillator and took little or no action for more than ten minutes before calling the clinical help desk for advice			1
@entity2 eventually asked for his own defibrillator to be fetched , but did not use it and made no efforts to perform cpr before declaring the woman dead			1
he told a @entity22 hearing the woman was already dead when he arrived at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25			0
but a three - man panel rejected his claim and decided that his fitness to practise was impaired due to his misconduct			0
@entity2 will now hear his fate at a later date yet to be announced after the panel ran out of time			1
student paramedic @entity35 , who was on the call on christmas day 2010 with @entity2 , said he did not tell his colleagues what he was doing and just sent her to fetch equipment			1
‘ we were saying her heart rate was getting slower , but he was on the phone in the doorway and waved his hand , to be quiet , he was not interested and he was busy ’ , she said			0
‘ at that point , there were still things we could have done for her			0
‘ even if it is not going to get anywhere , it is still worth going through the motions			0
’ ms @entity35 and a colleague reported @entity2 to bosses on their return to base at @entity59 in east @entity60			1
@entity2 , who has been found guilty of misconduct , had worked at @entity59 in east @entity60 pictured above the @entity22 panel ruled that he had made no efforts to save the woman and there was no evidence she was dead when @entity2 arrived			1

@entity73 , who chaired the hearing , said : ‘ mr @entity2 told the panel that he had fully reflected on the incident and that he is always learning			2
‘ he explained that he has reviewed his practice and undertaken extensive study			0
‘ however , he also said that he stands by his actions and he would only act differently with regard to communication with colleagues so they would understand his reasoning			0
’ ms @entity73 added : ‘ what mr @entity2 said about how he would approach further events of cardiac arrest did not give confidence that he would operate within the relevant guidelines			2
‘ this indicates a lack of real insight into this incident and demonstrates that he does not accept the validity of those guidelines			0
’ @entity2 , who was given an mbe in 2007 for his work in the ambulance service since 1985 , was accused of being an unreliable witness whose story had changed several times			2
‘ in a number of significant matters , we have found that mr @entity2 ’s subsequent accounts have both varied between themselves and departed from the events as they are recorded on the day ’ , ms @entity73 said			2
@entity2 offered reasons during the hearing why he failed to attach a heart monitor , opted not to use the defibrillator , or start @entity109			1
he also claimed to have been under stress during the incident because members of the woman ’s family were upset			0
the panel dismissed his excuses and ruled his fitness to practice was impaired because of misconduct			0
