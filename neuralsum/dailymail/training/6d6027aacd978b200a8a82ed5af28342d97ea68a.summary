by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 11:45 est , 3 may 2013 it 's not a sight you would expect to see in the @entity4 but these photographs show members of the tiny city state 's police undergoing riot training			2
dressed in protective overalls with the logo of the @entity4 police known as the @entity14 , the officers are seen wearing helmets and carrying shields as they are put through their paces by @entity19 colleagues			2
the drill took place in the parade square of the police @entity23 just behind @entity25 's and just hours after emeritus pope @entity26 returned to the @entity4 and moved into his new ' retirement home ' - a converted convent , after spending more than two months at the papal summer residence outside @entity30			1
@entity32 squad : @entity4 police undergo riot training with helmets and shields a @entity4 source who witnessed the drill from an overlooking window and who asked not to be named , said : ' it 's not something i have ever seen before and i would't really expect to see the @entity14 involving in public disorder situations in @entity25 's			0
' the exercise lasted several hours and involved the @entity4 police force moving forward against trainers who acted as rioters throwing bottles , stones and petrol bombs			2
in another session @entity19 police officers held up large protective pads while the @entity14 moved forward using batons to beat the ' rioters ' back			0
a team of @entity4 police known as @entity59 behind shields during exercises the drill took place in the parade square of the police @entity23 just behind @entity25 's and just hours after emeritus pope @entity26 returned to the @entity4 and moved into his new ' retirement home ' there are 130 members of the @entity14 and their main task is security within the @entity4 but they are not in charge of protecting current @entity72 , with that task left to the @entity74 , although they may be asked to step in when he leaves the city			1
they are armed and can be seen patrolling @entity77 keeping an eye out for numerous pickpockets who work in the area and who target the 18 million tourists who visit the @entity4 each year			0
technically the @entity14 are also supposed to monitor public order in the @entity4 but as the @entity85 teaches to ' turn the other cheek ' it 's would seem highly unlikely that they will ever be called into a riot situation			0
welcome home : @entity72 emeritus @entity26 , left , is welcomed by @entity72 as he returns at the @entity4 from the pontifical summer residence of @entity90 , south - east of @entity30 @entity77 regularly attracts several hundred thousand people every sunday morning for the @entity72 's weekly sermon and the number jumps when their is a special religious event or for the election of a new pontiff or funeral and enthronement but there has never been any rioting			1
the source joked : ' there is talk of @entity72 cutting salaries and bonuses for employees as he continues with his desire for a more humble @entity4 and maybe he 's getting ready for a violent reaction from them			0
' @entity111 arms : @entity72 emeritus @entity26 , left , is embraced by @entity72 amid reports he is ' depressed ' following his retirement from the @entity4			1

drills take place just hours after emeritus pope @entity26 returned to the @entity4 and moved into his new ' retirement home '
