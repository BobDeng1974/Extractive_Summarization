by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 28 march 2013 resolution : president @entity2 has signed a new law restricting @entity5 government agencies from buying computer technology made in @entity7 president @entity2 has hit back at @entity10 's alleged hacking campaign against @entity5 businesses by banning government from buying @entity7 computer technology			1
the new rule , which was buried in a spending bill signed this week , comes after a string of hacks traced back to @entity7 hit some of @entity5 's most important companies			1
it will only be in effect until the end of the fiscal year on september 30 , but could yet pave the way for broader , more permanent changes in how the @entity5 government buys technology			1
' this is a change of direction , ' said @entity30 , a former senior official at the @entity31 who now works for the legal firm @entity32 and @entity33 in @entity34			0
' my guess is we 're going to keep going in this direction for a while			0
' @entity5 computer security firm @entity40 in march released details on what it said was an aggressive hacking campaign on @entity5 businesses by a @entity7 military unit			1
since then , treasury secretary @entity46 has used high - level meetings with @entity10 officials to press the matter			0
@entity10 has denied the allegations			0
lawmakers tucked the provision into the latest budget resolution , which enables the government to pay for day - to day operations for the rest of the fiscal year , under the innocuous heading ' section 156 '			1
it bans the @entity61 departments , @entity60 and the @entity62 from buying hardware ' produced , manufactured or assembled ' by any entity ' owned , operated or subsidised ' by the @entity7			1
the agencies can only acquire the technology if , after consulting with the @entity67 , they determine that there is no risk of ' cyberespionage or sabotage associated with the acquisition of the system '			2
' source of attacks ' : unit 61398 is located in @entity80 's @entity79 district and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in @entity82 as well as computer programming and network operations , the report said ground zero : the building , used by the @entity87 , is located on the outskirts of @entity80 rep. @entity89 , the top @entity90 on the @entity91 , said he supports the restriction and does n't think it would be too cumbersome for federal agencies			2
the @entity96 departments already are mindful of how its networks are built			0
a secretive @entity7 military unit is believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on the @entity5 government as well as aerospace , communications and energy companies , a report claimed last month			1
@entity5 security firm @entity40 identified the @entity87 's @entity80 - based @entity77 as the most likely driving force behind hundreds , if not thousands of cyber attacks			2
it said says an office block housing the unit is linked to stolen technology blueprints , manufacturing processes , clinical trial results , pricing documents , negotiation strategies and other secret data from more than 100 companies			2
more alarmingly , it claims the unit , known online as the @entity77 , has also made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines , power grids , water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure			0
' the nature of @entity77 's work is considered by @entity7 to be a state secret , ' @entity40 said in a report released at the end of february			2
' however , we believe it engages in harmful " @entity133 "			0
' it is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in @entity7 and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively , ' it said			1
the @entity140 dismissed the report as ' groundless ' and said the government firmly opposed hacking			0
' @entity145 attacks are transnational and anonymous			0
determining their origins are extremely difficult			0
we do n't know how the evidence in this so - called report can be tenable , ' said spokesman @entity151			0
' @entity153 criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible , unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue			0
' ' anything we can do to call awareness to the fact that we 're continuing to be cyberattacked , we 're continuing to lose jobs , and that billions of dollars in @entity5 money is being stolen , ' mr @entity89 said yesterday			2
he and @entity91 chairman @entity162 , a @entity163 , released a report late last year urging @entity5 companies and government agencies to drop any business with @entity7 telecommunications companies @entity170 and @entity171 because of the security risks they pose			1
' any bug , beacon or backdoor put into our critical systems could allow for a catastrophic and devastating domino effect of failures throughout our networks , ' mr @entity162 said in a statement accompanying the report			0
but a blanket prohibition on technology linked to the @entity7 government may be easier said than done			1
information systems are often a complicated assembly of parts manufactured by different companies around the globe			0
and investigating where each part came from , and if that part is made by a company that could have ties to the @entity7 government could be difficult			1
@entity170 , the world 's third - largest maker of smartphones , says it is owned by its employees and rejects claims that it is controlled by the communist government or @entity7 's military			1
depending on how the @entity2 administration interprets the law , @entity30 said it also could cause problems for the @entity5 with the @entity204			2
the @entity204 's members include @entity5 allies like @entity207 and @entity208 that might rely on @entity7 technology to build computers or handsets			1
but in the end , @entity30 says it could make the @entity5 government safer and wiser			1
' we do have to worry about buying equipment from companies that may not have our best interests at heart , ' he said .			0

new rule bans agencies including @entity60 from buying @entity7 computers
it was passed as part of the latest budget resolution signed this week
@entity229 comes after @entity7 government linked to string of hacks on @entity5
