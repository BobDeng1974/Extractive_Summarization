an artist has cashed in on the recent vogue for dense facial fuzz and created the @entity4 calendar in which a scruff appears to get longer with every successive month			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , has drawn 12 beards in various stages of growth , beginning with january 's designer stubble and finally ending in a full woodsman 's beard in december			1
each stage is printed on transparent paper , making the fuzz seem bushier as the year goes on , and the pages are laid over each other			1
she said : ' the idea was to illustrate something that could change during the year			2
a beard fits perfectly for this purpose			0
' beards are really popular , many men grow one and many women like them			0
' she admits to being a fan of the facial hair herself , adding , ' it 's natural and manly ' and ' pleasant to touch '			2
the designer said she did n't expect so much attention on the project and has been overwhelmed by the number of likes and shares online			1
in 2014 we saw beard baubles and beard sculptures , now men can invest in a beard calendar thanks to being layered on transparent paper , the beard in @entity6 's calendar appears to grow the calendar consists of 12 transparent @entity58 layers for each month			1
the beard graphics overlay each other , mimicking the effect of growth over the period of time			0
for those who hoped 2014 had reached peak beard , this is evidence that we 're still obsessed with all things whiskery			0
in december alone , a series of accessories just for beards were created including beard baubles and icicles designed to nestle among the bristles			0
a @entity77 - based father , @entity76 , also became famous as @entity78 - the creator of weird and wonderful sculptures made from his impressive chest - length facial hair			0
