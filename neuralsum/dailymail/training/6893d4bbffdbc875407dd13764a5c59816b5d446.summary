crack down : a prisoner has been banned from receiving his weekly copy of @entity4 by jail chiefs in @entity29 because it contained pictures of guns after the justice secretary @entity26 ( right ) curbed inmate perks mr @entity26 announced this week that prisoners will no longer have an automatic right to a tv in their cell , will have all 18 - rated dvds confiscated and be forced to wear a prison uniform in their first two weeks inside			1
but @entity11 , who is currently enjoying a stay at @entity39 , a category c prison in @entity29 , decried the decision and described himself as a ‘ country boy ’ at heart			1
he said @entity4 , which has a weekly circulation of just under 22,200 , and was first published in 1882 , did not tell him how to make a machine gun			2
he moaned : ‘ not only are we being treated like impressionable children by being denied the right to buy 18 rated dvds , but it appears i can no longer get my magazine @entity50 because it contains guns			1
inside : prison chiefs at @entity39 , a category c prison in @entity29 , have banned an inmate from reading his favourite magazine because it contained pictures of guns ‘ @entity50 , for these who do n't know , is full of articles on shooting , fieldcraft , farming , conservation , fishing , dog breeding and cookery			1
‘ nowhere in its pages does it inform you how to make an @entity68 out of everyday items you might find in a prison cell			2
’ ‘ i am a country boy and these things are my interest			2
’ he added : ‘ next they 'll be banning performance car magazines in case someone builds a @entity77 out of prison - issue tracksuits			0
’ mr @entity26 said this week that it was wrong that some prisoners were ' watching daytime television while the rest of the country goes out to work '			0

' but also by working , taking part in education or accepting the opportunities to rehabilitate themselves			0
’ the changes followed a review which criticised the ‘ frills ’ available to prisoners but unaffordable for ordinary families			0
a @entity105 spokesperson said today : ' items such as this are not considered appropriate for prisoners			0
