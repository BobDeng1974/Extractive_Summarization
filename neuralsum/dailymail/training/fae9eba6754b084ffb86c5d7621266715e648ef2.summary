in 2010/11 , six barristers received more than £ 500,000 each for defending suspected criminals at the taxpayer ’s expense			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ we have an excellent tradition of legal aid and one of the best legal professions in the world			1
but we can not close our eyes to the fact legal aid is still costing too much			0
‘ it is not free money - it is paid for by hard - working taxpayers , so we must ensure we get the very best value for every penny spent			2
’ the fee reduction is part of a string of measures designed to slash £ 220million from the criminal legal - aid bill , which is currently more than £ 1billion a year			1
in other measures , defendants living in households with a disposable income of £ 37,500 or more would not automatically be given legal aid			2
mr @entity6 also wants to see criminals pay for the cost of running courts out of their future earnings			1
offenders can already be required to make payments to victims , the courts or other government agencies through a range of orders and fines			2
but there is currently no power to make them pay directly towards the running costs of the court , such as security and staff			0
mr @entity6 decided to act after seeing the sums paid to the highest - earning qcs			1

and prisoners will be denied legal aid unless the case relates to their sentence			0
mr @entity6 said taxpayers ’ money is being used for ‘ unnecessary legal cases ’ that could be dealt with by the prison service , such as which category of jail an inmate is being kept in			1
solicitors criticised other plans to make them compete for some legal contracts in the future			0
@entity111 , president of the @entity112 , said : ‘ we also think it is implausible that tendering will save the sort of sums of money the @entity118 is looking for , and there is some doubt whether it will save anything at all			0
’ last week , reforms to the @entity123 came into effect , removing large areas of law from the scope of civil legal aid			0
these included welfare and family law			0
some law firms estimated that the reforms will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent			0
@entity137 graduate : @entity138 has an ' enviable success rate ' according to his practice website the crackdown follows outrage that former fugitive @entity143 received more than £ 1million in legal aid while renting a £ 23,000 - a - month @entity146 residence during his trial for stealing £ 28.8million from his @entity149 empire in the 1980s			2
' we can not close our eyes to the fact legal aid is still costing too much			0
