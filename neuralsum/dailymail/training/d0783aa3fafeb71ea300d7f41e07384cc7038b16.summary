by @entity0 last updated at 5:13 pm on 19th october 2011 anger : sir @entity2 , pictured when he sat as a high court judge , suggested @entity5 families should follow the example set by relatives of those killed in the @entity10 stadium disaster a retired judge has sparked fury by calling on the @entity5 families to behave with more ' dignity ' - like the relatives of victims of the @entity10 stadium disaster			1
sir @entity2 , who chaired the public inquiry into the 1985 fire at the @entity19 stadium that killed 56 people , called on the @entity22 families to look at the ' quiet dignity and great courage ' relatives in the @entity27 city have shown in the years following the tragedy			1
his controversial comments came a day after mps took part in an emotional commons debate on the tragedy in which home secretary @entity33 pledged to release all possible documents on the 1989 @entity36 semi-final tragedy that left 96 @entity22 fans dead			1
in a letter to @entity39 he said : ' the citizens of @entity10 behaved with quiet dignity and great courage			0
' they did not harbour conspiracy theories			0
they did not seek endless further inquiries			0
' they buried their dead , comforted the bereaved and succoured the injured			0
' they organised a sensible compensation scheme and moved on			0
' is there , perhaps , a lesson there for the @entity5 campaigners ? ' @entity54 mp @entity53 ( @entity55 ) told @entity39 : ' how insensitive does somebody have to be to write that load of drivel ? ' it is unbelievable			1
to mention other tragedies simply because they are football - related , as if there is some common denominator because they happened in football stadiums , beggars belief			0
' was there a conspiracy after the @entity10 fire ? ' did the government try to blame the @entity10 fans for setting fire to the stadium on purpose ? ' it shows how people right at the top of the @entity78 still harbour prejudice and ignorance			2
' @entity81 , whose son @entity82 died in the disaster , told the newspaper : ' he ought to be ashamed of himself			0
' angry @entity22 fans also took to @entity86 to condemn the former judge			0
@entity88 said : ' sir @entity2 , you are a pompous self - centred , attention seeking oaf			1
a knight of the realm ? says it all about this country			0
' tragedy : a policeman enters the pitch at the @entity5 stadium to tell the referee to stop the match as the 1989 tragedy unfolds during the @entity36 game between @entity22 and @entity103 flash fire : 56 supporters died when the blaze swept through the @entity19 stand at @entity10 's ground @entity108 today told mps there ' were regrets ' over the 1989 @entity114 government 's handling of the @entity5 disaster			1
speaking at @entity117 's questions in the @entity118 , he repeated his pledge to release official documents detailing the tragedy at @entity123 's football stadium			2
mr @entity108 said : ' we are gong to open up those papers and publish those papers as we promised , so people can see what was happening			2
' he said the @entity129 launched in the aftermath of the tragedy was a ' proper and thorough investigation ' which led to huge changes in the way football grounds and crowds are managed			2
but @entity54 mp @entity53 , who led monday 's commons debate on the release of @entity140 papers , urged the prime minister to admit governments had made mistakes over the tragedy			1
concern has focused on briefings given to then prime minister @entity146 and her @entity147			2
mr @entity53 ( @entity55 ) added : ' twenty - two years is 22 years too long to fight for the truth			0
' if it 's proven that there was an orchestrated cover - up , despite two decades passing , justice should still prevail and those really responsible for the @entity5 disaster should be brought to book			1
' mr @entity108 told him : ' i 'm hugely sympathetic for the families of the victims and i am sure there are regrets for all the institutions involved at the time , including the government			1
