private schools have put themselves in danger warns dr @entity2 thousands of middle - income families have been priced out of private schools by inflation - busting fee rises			1
average fees have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation over the past ten years			1
the increases mean that private schooling is now beyond average earners in well - paid occupations , including pharmacists , architects , it experts , engineers and scientists			1
a decade ago , these professionals would have been able to afford to pay fees out of earned income			2
now , however , they would struggle without funding from other sources , according to the study			0
the average annual fee for a day pupil at a private school is £ 11,457 , up from £ 6,820 in 2002 , researchers found			2
charges have risen 68 per cent in that period , 1.8 times faster than retail price inflation over the same period , which was up 37 per cent			0
private school fees are considered affordable if they account for 25 per cent or less of the average annual full - time salary before tax			1
but £ 11,457 represents 35 per cent of this average , which stands at £ 33,011 , according to the study by @entity37			2
in 2002 , fees would have taken 27 per cent			0
@entity39 , economist at the bank , said the rises make it ‘ increasingly difficult for the average worker in many occupations to afford a private education for their offspring ’			2
those who can most easily afford the fees include accountants , senior police officers , airline pilots and production managers as fees represent 19 per cent of their annual earnings			0

the independent sector is becoming socially exclusive in a way not seen since @entity80			0
’ dr @entity2 is now director of education at @entity82 , an international schools group aiming to make private education ‘ affordable ’			1
he added : ‘ the sector has become too dependent on overseas parents and is profiting from a state sector in some turmoil as a result of radical change			0

next were @entity95 ( 74 per cent ) and the @entity96 and @entity97 , both at just under 70 per cent			0
