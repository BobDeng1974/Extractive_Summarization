when stress is ' delivered ' as awareness moves in , peace fills the void
this week it 's the @entity41 exercise from @entity46
aim is to pay attention to areas of tension , and then to breathe ' into ' them
either *sit* in a *straight* - *backed* chair , *upright* but *relaxed* , or lie down with your arms at your sides .
close your eyes . allow your *shoulders* , neck , back and face to soften . feel the points of contact between your body and the *floor* or chair .
be aware of your breathing . feel the whole body *expand* and contract .
guide your awareness to the first area of tension . allow the breath to *soothe* and *massage* it .
focus awareness on the next area of tension for a few minutes , and then the next , until you have *explored* the most tense areas of your body .
open your eyes and gently move your body .
