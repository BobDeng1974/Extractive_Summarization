by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 19:42 est , 18 december 2012 league tables are to be published to measure the performance of surgeons – including their patients ’ survival rates			1
from next summer , online comparisons can be made of doctors who specialise in procedures including hip and knee replacements and weight - loss surgery			1
@entity14 officials say it will give patients more power and enable them to choose to have their operation carried out by a top surgeon at another hospital			2
online league tables are to be published detailing the performances of doctors who specialise in procedures including hip and knee replacements and weight - loss surgery ( file picture ) but there are concerns that doctors might try to avoid operating on risky patients – such as the elderly or those with underlying illnesses – to keep their death rates low			1
professor @entity31 , from @entity32 , said : ‘ i think groups of patients who look bad will be turned down for surgery			1
’ he also said that doctors who had a ‘ bad run ’ of luck with patients dying under their care would appear to be performing badly			2
@entity40 , director of policy at the health think - tank the @entity43 , said similar issues had been raised when such rankings were introduced in @entity46			1
sir @entity47 , chief executive of @entity48 , wants to give power to the patient she said it was important that the performance data took into account whether a surgeon had operated on high - risk patients			2
the plans were outlined yesterday by the @entity48 , a new organisation tasked with overseeing gps and hospital care			0
by summer , patients will be able to visit the @entity62 website and compare the performance of doctors specialising in head and neck operations , bariatric – or weight loss , orthopaedic and bowel and stomach procedures			1
sir @entity47 , chief executive of the board , said : ‘ what you need is patients with power , with influence , with information and you need clinicians with resources , the tools , the money to make the change happen			0
’ officials also hope it will drive up standards and expose those surgeons who are putting patients at risk			0
a spokesman for the @entity92 , which represents doctors , said : ‘ we support measures that will allow patients to have more information about their care and health outcomes			0
‘ however , there is still more to be done to ensure that data about consultants ’ performance is meaningful			0
‘ basic mortality figures alone could mislead patients because they fail to take into account other factors that might have contributed to the death of a patient			0

online comparisons to be published on @entity62 website next summer
will include procedures such as hip replacements and weight - loss surgery
