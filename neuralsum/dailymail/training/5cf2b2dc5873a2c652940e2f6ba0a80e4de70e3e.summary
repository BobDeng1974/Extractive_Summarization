mr @entity2 , who was murdered in 2013 , claimed he punched @entity6 after a row in a @entity11 bar in 2006 after mr @entity2 's death , @entity6 substitutes mr @entity2 's widow , @entity87 , right , as the defendant in his lawsuit the defence last week said the pieces will add up to a whole that vindicates mr @entity2 , while @entity6 's lawyer said the accounts are riddled with inconsistencies that make them unreliable			1
@entity6 testified again yesterday that there was no fight and that mr @entity2 fabricated the story			1

' @entity6 made $ 190,378 in 2012 and said he thinks @entity145 canceled the series because of the controversy over @entity2 's book			2
but he acknowledged he ca n't prove it			0
but @entity2 estate attorney @entity151 suggested the falloff was @entity6 's own fault because of what the lawyer called his propensity for making outrageous and offensive statements on tv and in his own books			2

he said he no longer feels welcome at reunions			0
