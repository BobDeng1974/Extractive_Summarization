@entity1 taxpayers are paying to make jails in @entity3 and @entity4 more comfortable in a desperate bid to persuade foreign criminals to serve their sentences at home			1
ministers have resorted to the tactic – designed to satisfy the human rights of inmates – after it emerged that the @entity1 ’s own prison system has turned into a ‘ @entity15 of crime ’			1
research by the @entity18 , seen by the @entity19 , reveals how our jails contain inmates from a staggering 156 countries – more than three out of every four member states of the @entity15			1
@entity26 prison in @entity4 : the government wants to deport some of the 594 @entity4 currently in @entity1 prisons worryingly , the total number of foreign prisoners is rising – despite pledges by @entity32 to fix the mess			1
by march this year , there were 11,127 behind bars , at an estimated cost to the @entity1 public purse of more than £ 420million			1
this is up from 10,778 in 2011			0
the group , which includes rapists , murderers and burglars , now makes up more than one in every eight convicts			0
underfire : the prime minister has put aside £ 3million a year to try and ensure foreign prisons serve their sentences at home the figures were disclosed as the prime minister faced more criticism yesterday over his foreign aid commitments			1
mr @entity32 was taking part in a radio phone - in when a pensioner called to tell him it was wrong that she was denied a cancer drug while billions were spent on overseas aid			0
meanwhile , it emerged that the dire need to create space in our packed jails has prompted ministers to take the extraordinary step of establishing a £ 3million annual pot to make it easier for convicts to serve their sentences back home			1
splashing money on prisons abroad is certain to prove controversial			0
but officials insist it will be cheaper in the long run than the annual £ 38,000 bill for keeping a single prisoner locked up here			2
currently , money is being spent in @entity3 to ‘ assist @entity3 authorities in modernising their prison service and rehabilitation and reintegration activities ’			1
in @entity4 , one project supports the provision of ‘ human rights training for prison officers ’			2
a second project will construct new facilities at a women ’s prison in its biggest city , @entity91 , to reduce overcrowding			0
@entity3 tops the list of the nations with most prisoners in @entity1 jails , with 900 inmates			1
last night sir @entity99 , chairman of @entity100 , said : ‘ to some extent , this is the inevitable legacy of mass immigration of 3.5million people under @entity105			0
‘ the resources necessary to tackle the rising number of foreign prisoners have not been made available			0
’ @entity110 mp @entity109 said : ‘ prison is always the best place for dangerous criminals , but our jails should not be used as hotels for foreigners			0
ministers need to take action to deport them to serve their sentences in the countries they come from and then stop them from coming back to @entity1			1
@entity123 in @entity124 , @entity3 : money is being spent modernising the @entity3 prison service as well as rehabilitation and reintegration activities ‘ living in @entity1 is a privilege and foreigners who come here and flout our laws should be sent packing without delay			1
’ in november 2010 , the @entity19 revealed how the prime minister had decided to spearhead a campaign for foreign criminals to serve their sentences back home			0
to do this , ministers must be able to convince the courts that the offenders will not suffer breaches of their human rights by being made to stay in squalid conditions			0
the @entity146 said it had just signed a new agreement which should see a greater number of @entity150 prisoners being transferred from the @entity1 to complete their sentences			2
the compulsory prisoner transfer agreement is the first they have managed to agree with a nation with a large number of foreign national offenders in @entity1 prisons			1
they now hope to agree more			0
there are currently around 180 @entity150 prisoners in @entity1 prisons , of whom over 100 may be eligible for transfer			2
prudent : prison minister @entity163 insists the scheme will save taxpayers money in the long term the agreement also means that @entity1 citizens who are serving prison sentences in @entity150 may also be compulsorily transferred back to the @entity1			2
prisons minister @entity163 said : ‘ we are already removing thousands of foreign criminals at the end of their sentence , or under transfer agreements to serve the rest of their sentence back home			0
‘ we believe that , wherever possible , foreign national prisoners should serve their sentences in their own country			0
‘ not only will it save money for the @entity1 , it will also mean that these prisoners will be closer to family and @entity188 helps to support prisoners ’ social rehabilitation and reintegration into society			2
‘ transfers also help their home country to put in place any appropriate public protection measures on their release			0
‘ i hope this compulsory prisoner transfer agreement will be the first of many arrangements to free up prison spaces and reduce the burden to taxpayers of foreign criminals who should rightly become the responsibility of their own country and not the @entity1			1
’ the last government tried a string of desperate tactics to reduce the number of overseas inmates			2
offenders were offered credit cards pre-loaded with more than £ 450 - funded by the taxpayer - if they agreed to return home			0
the perk was part of a package worth up to £ 5,000 designed to ‘ bribe ’ them to leave the @entity1 .			1

@entity1 jails house inmates from 156 countries , including 900 @entity3 and 594 @entity4
government is *spending* £ 3million modernising foreign jails
