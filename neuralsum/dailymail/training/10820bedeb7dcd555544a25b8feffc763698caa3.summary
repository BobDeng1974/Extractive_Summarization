by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 6:54 am on 31st december 2011 the @entity3 authorities have agreed to stop raiding the offices of human rights and pro-democracy groups after the @entity8 government intervened			2
defense secretary @entity9 welcomed the decision , but expressed ' deep concern ' that the attacks by security forces had been allowed to take place			1
the non-governmental organisations had been accused by @entity3 's military rulers of destabilising security by fomenting protests with the help of foreign funding			1
provocative : @entity3 military stand guard as officials raid a @entity8 - headquartered non-governmental organisation office in @entity25 yesterday thursday 's raids on a total of 17 offices throughout @entity3 were part of the ruling generals ' attempt to blame ' foreign hands ' for the unrest that continues to roil @entity3 since the 18 - day revolt that ousted long - time leader @entity35 in february			1
among the offices ransacked were the @entity8 - headquartered @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39 , which is observing @entity3 's staggered parliamentary elections			1
the @entity42 administration demanded @entity3 authorities immediately halt the raids on @entity45 , saying they are ' inconsistent ' with long - standing @entity8 - @entity3 cooperation			1
the @entity47 called on the @entity3 government ' to immediately end the harassment of @entity45 staff , return all property and resolve this issue '			1
yesterday the @entity3 authorities agreed to call an end to the raids after negotiations with mr @entity9 and @entity8 ambassador to @entity25 @entity57			1
armed raids : @entity3 soldiers ransack the @entity8 @entity37 , an ngo ( non-governmental ) rights group in @entity25 as a soldier stands guard according to a @entity47 spokesman , ms @entity57 told the authorities she expected ' all international ngos , including those that receive @entity8 government support , to be able to return to normal operations as soon as possible in support of the democratic transition under way in @entity3			1
' she agreed to take part in a dialogue with @entity3 officials to better explain the work of the organizations and address any concerns they might have			2
' these ngos should be allowed to operate freely as they do in countries around the world in support of democracy and free elections , ' the spokesman said			0
after ms @entity57 's discussions , mr @entity9 spoke by phone to the head of @entity3 's ruling military council , field marshal @entity90 , to emphasize the importance the administration places on the country 's democratic transition and the ability of non-governmental organisations to work			1
@entity9 expressed appreciation for the decision to stop the raids and make it easier for @entity45 to work in @entity3 , a @entity98 spokesman said			2
' the secretary emphasised that it is critical for @entity3 to continue on the path to democratic transition , ' he added			2
the raids on the @entity45 were the first since @entity35 left office , though @entity3 officials have been levying accusations for months that the civil society groups are serving a foreign agenda			2
most recently , justice minister @entity113 this month accused around 300 non-profit groups of receiving unauthorised foreign funding and using the money for protests			1
the @entity118 said the raids on ten non-profit organisations were part of the investigation into foreign funding of rights groups			1
by far the largest recipient of foreign funding in @entity3 is the military itself , which has for more than 30 years received about $ 1.3billion in annual @entity8 security assistance			1
out of their hands : @entity37 workers wait as @entity3 officials raid their office @entity38 said its staff were held incommunicado during the raids and that mobile phones , laptops , funds and documents found during the interrogations were confiscated			2
the group said in a statement the raids came just three days after it formally submitted papers to register its offices in accordance with @entity3 law			2
troops and police sealed the doors of the civil society groups and banned anyone from entering or speaking with employees as they were interrogated			0
@entity38 spokesman @entity153 said : ' in the current fiscal environment , the @entity8 must not subsidise authoritarianism in @entity3 while the @entity3 government is preventing ngos from implementing democracy and human rights projects subsidised by the @entity8 taxpayer			0
' the @entity25 - based @entity161 ( @entity161 ) , which is not under investigation , said in a statement that the raids went beyond the type of @entity35 - era tactics that spurred hundreds of thousands of @entity3 to take to the streets demanding freedom and democracy during this year 's uprising			2
@entity161 said in a statement : ' @entity35 's regime did not dare to undertake such practices prior to the uprising ' , adding that the storming of the civil society organisations ' offices is part of ' a systematic campaign against these organisations , which was prepared for in advance '			0
the country 's military was cheered by protesters when it took over security from @entity35 's hated police force in january during the uprising			1
the military , long the country 's most powerful establishment and one that produced @entity3 's last three presidents , sought to portray itself as a key player in the revolt that toppled @entity35 's 29 - year rule			1
held hostage : employees of the @entity45 were banned from leaving and were interrogated as officials searched through computer file however , in the eight months since @entity35 's exit , the military , led by a general who served for 20 years as @entity35 's defence minister , has been methodically seeking to discredit the reformers , accusing them of illegally receiving foreign funds and being part of a plot hatched abroad to destabilise @entity3			1
@entity3 's leading pro-democracy advocate , @entity208 peace laureate @entity207 , denounced the raids			1
writing on his @entity211 account , he said : ' human rights organisations are the guardians of nascent freedom			0
efforts to suffocate them will be a major setback and will surely backfire			0
' an official with the @entity3 attorney general 's office said at least one of the @entity8 - based organisations being searched was operating without proper permits			2
he did not say which one			0
laws requiring local and foreign civil society groups to register with the government have long been a source of contention , with rights activists accusing the government of using legal provisions to go after groups critical of its policies			0
offenders can be sentenced to prison terms			0
a security official said ' influencing public opinion in non-peaceful ways ' is among the possible charges that could be brought against the ten organisations being investigated			0
the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to reporters			0
the security sweep on civil society offices comes on the heels of a military crackdown on protesters demanding ruling generals hand over power to a civilian authority			0
soldiers attempting to end the protest last week beat women and dragged one half - naked while kicking her in the street			0
at least 17 protesters were killed , adding to the roughly 100 people killed in clashes with security since @entity35 's exit			0
@entity262 , @entity263 's deputy director for the @entity264 and @entity265 , said that the ruling @entity266 is trying to attack groups that have criticised the military 's human rights records			0
she said : ' i believe @entity266 is trying to find some scapegoat for their human rights record			0
targeting civil society was a technique used by @entity35 , so it really is reminiscent of the worst tactics of the @entity35 era			0
