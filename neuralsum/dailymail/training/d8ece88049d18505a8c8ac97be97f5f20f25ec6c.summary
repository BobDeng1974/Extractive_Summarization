last month ’s @entity31 into the @entity10 scandal did not blame individual ministers and mr @entity1 insisted there should be no hunt for scapegoats			2
the prime minister has also steadfastly backed the embattled @entity14 chief executive sir @entity37 who has ignored calls from mps , medical professionals and patients to stand down			1
but yesterday mr @entity1 changed his tune at @entity36 ’s questions when @entity11 mp @entity44 asked why he did not sack sir @entity37 over the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at the trust			1
sir @entity37 faces growing calls to resign for his role in the @entity52 scandal mr @entity1 said sir @entity37 , who previously ran the regional health authority overseeing @entity10 , had ‘ very frankly and candidly apologised ’ for mistakes made , suggesting @entity11 had not			1

‘ @entity37 has made his apology and wants to get on with his job of running an excellent @entity77 , and other people , frankly , should be thinking of their positions too			2
’ a @entity11 source attacked his comments , saying : ‘ this seems a pretty shabby and cheap attempt to politicise the @entity31			1
it made clear that no ministers were to blame			0
it is not the right thing to try to politicise what was a human tragedy			0
’ but pressure is piling on ministers over their protection of sir @entity37			1
last night at a meeting of the @entity94 of @entity96 backbenchers , dozens called for his resignation			0
@entity98 , who represents the @entity10 seat of @entity100 , said : ‘ is there a single person in this room who thinks @entity37 should n’t go ? ’ only one person indicated that they disagreed with mr cash			0
health secretary @entity20 , left , said his @entity11 predecessors including @entity108 , right , should take responsibility for ' catastrophic policy mistakes ' sir @entity37 caused fury on tuesday by pleading ignorance to damning evidence that patients were failed on his watch			1

last night mr @entity20 wrote on the website @entity144 that ‘ warnings were suppressed ’ by @entity11 that their ‘ command and control structure ’ for the @entity14 was not working			1
sir @entity37 was in charge of the regional health body supervising the @entity10 trust , and later head of the @entity125 , over the four - year period in which up to 1,200 are feared to have died needlessly he said they had to take the blame for ‘ catastrophic policy mistakes ... all of which are having a direct target on the lack of compassionate care in parts of the @entity14 today ’			1
mr @entity20 added : ‘ @entity11 can and will be held accountable for what happened at @entity52			2
‘ unless we hear a proper account from @entity11 , the public will reasonably conclude that similar events could easily happen again if @entity11 regained power – because the party that used to claim the @entity14 was safe in its hands is proving by its silence the exact opposite			2
’ no 10 is understood to want to keep sir @entity37 because he understands the major reforms to the @entity77 which will be unveiled next month			2
the ‘ @entity172 ’ involves slashing £ 20billion from the @entity14 budget			0
by @entity173 , health reporter sir @entity37 's successor ? @entity176 is believed to be in the frame if the @entity14 chief gets sacked the head of the @entity14 appeared to be losing his grip on power last night as it emerged that senior directors are quietly lining up a successor			1
sir @entity37 has repeatedly defied calls to resign , despite being at the centre of one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory			1
but the @entity189 understands senior health service directors believe his position is untenable and are now in the process of appointing a replacement			0
the man in the frame is understood to be @entity176 , a former adviser to @entity1 , who is currently head of health at consultancy firm @entity198			0
he was interviewed by professor @entity199 , chairman of the @entity200 , two weeks ago with a view to being appointed deputy chief executive			0

but mr @entity1 publicly disowned him in 2011 – claiming he ’d ‘ never heard ’ of him – after mr @entity176 implied the @entity14 would become increasingly privatised			0
last year however , mr @entity176 said he had ‘ every intention of returning to the @entity14 ’			0
in an interview with the @entity229 he said : ‘ i love the @entity14			0
i do n’t see what is wrong with going and getting some different sector experience to develop my capabilities as manager and go back to the @entity14 in the future			0
’ former health secretary @entity235 is said to have wanted to bring him in to replace sir @entity37 soon after the @entity236 came to power in 2010			1
