a man has been handed one of the most bizarre @entity2 ever issued by magistrates - he is banned from falling over anywhere in @entity5 and @entity6			1
serial attention - seeker @entity7 , 51 , was given the anti-social behaviour order after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries in order to dupe passing motorists into calling him an ambulance			1
incredibly , the order bans @entity7 from deliberately falling over and lying on the ground anywhere in @entity5 or @entity6 , if he is doing it to for attention			1
@entity7 , 51 , was given an asbo after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries for attention a court heard how he began pestering emergency services with prank calls but later went to increasingly bizarre lengths to get his kicks , as neighbours and ambulance crews became familiar with his antics and tried to ignore him			1
after being persuaded by police to give up his mobile phone , @entity7 decided to attract attention instead by wandering the streets near his home in @entity34 , @entity35 , before pretending to fall over and acting as though he had been injured			1
when his increasingly fed - up neighbours began ignoring his amateur dramatics , he took to busy main roads nearby and would lie on the ground , pretending he had been hit by a car , until someone stopped to assist him			2
@entity7 was handed the two - year @entity2 , which also prohibits him from being drunk in a public place and calling the emergency services unless in a genuine emergency , by magistrates in @entity46			1
the bench ruled that the @entity2 was necessary to protect the public and emergency services from the consequences of his anti-social behaviour			2
@entity53 @entity52 , from @entity54 , said : ' @entity7 came to police attention initially by making time - wasting calls to the emergency services			1
on most occasions he would be intoxicated			0
' when dealt with by a police and council joint team he gave away his telephone to stop the temptation			0
however he then took to pretending to fall in the street near his home as a way of attracting attention to himself			2
' he would lay there feigning an injury until an ambulance attended			0
local residents came to know what he was doing and started to ignore him and regard him as a nuisance			0
@entity73 then would orchestrate his falls on a nearby main road whereby he would be seen by a larger number of people			0
@entity46 @entity78 ( pictured ) where @entity7 was given the asbo			2
he is banned from deliberately falling over , drinking in public , and contacting the emergency services unless it is a genuine emergency ' numerous motorists have done the decent thing and stopped to assist the man laying on the ground			1
not realising they were being duped , they invariably would call an ambulance to attend to him			0
' the ambulance staff and paramedics would normally recognise @entity7 and know what he was doing but were duty - bound to deal with him professionally			2
on a number of occasions he was taken to @entity93 in @entity94 where he was more thoroughly checked over but he was always discharged as having no injuries			0
' he has been offered support from numerous agencies and given many opportunities to change his behaviour			0
@entity7 ' continual lack of engagement has ultimately resulted in this town wide asbo			0
