by @entity0 they have pulled the wool over our eyes for years			0
goats are far from silly billies			1
scientists say that despite their reputation for being slow - witted , goats are actually rather intelligent			2
in one particular task , they were quicker on the uptake than chimps			2
smart : research from @entity15 , @entity16 , found goats learn fast and have excellent memories the @entity15 researchers hope the finding will lead to improved conditions on farms and in sanctuaries			1
the scientists began by training a dozen goats use a two - step process to retrieve a pasta and grass treat encased in a plastic box with an extendable lever			1
first , they had to use their lips to grab a string that pulled out the lever			2
they then used their muzzle to nudge the lever upwards and release the food			2
nine of the 12 animals quickly learnt the task			1
only one of the three remaining animals actually failed			2
two others were disqualified for trying to use their horns rather than faces to lift the lever			0
researcher @entity45 said : ‘ the key thing is that this was a two - step process			0
it was n’t a case of just pressing a button and food coming out			0
‘ it requires a level of reasoning and understanding			0
’ on average , it took the goats 12 attempts to learn how to access the food - meaning they were quicker on the uptake than chimps using similar equipment			1
tasks : the scientists began by training a dozen goats use a two - step process to retrieve a pasta and grass treat encased in a plastic box with an extendable lever dr @entity45 said that while this does n’t mean they are more intelligent than chimps overall , it was still an impressive result			1
ten months later , the animals could still remember what to do - a sign of ‘ excellent ’ long - term memory			1
dr @entity45 said : ‘ they remembered straight away , without any reminders or training			0
’ the study , published in the journal @entity84 also revealed that the animals learnt just as quickly when left to their own devices as when they watched another goat solve the puzzle			1
this is important , as it is often thought that learning through mimicry is a sign of intelligence			0
dr @entity45 , who has previously shown that goats have ‘ regional accents ’ said : ‘ it seems that goats are perfectly good at problem solving by themselves			0
‘ our results challenge the common misconception that goats are n’t intelligent animals - they have the ability to learn complex tasks and remember them for a long time			1
’ it is thought that the abilities help the animals find food in harsh and changeable environments			0
dr @entity113 only looked at goats but he suspects sheep are also more intelligent than they are given credit for			0
proof of this comes from @entity119 research which found that @entity121 mountain sheep can map their surroundings and may even be able to plan ahead			0
solitary : the study , published in the journal @entity84 also revealed that the animals learnt just as quickly when left to their own devices			1

researchers said goats learn fast and have excellent memories
study by @entity15 used simple tasks
animals had to retrieve pasta and a grass treat *enclosed* in a box
nine out of the twelve animals learned task , nudging lever with their nose
