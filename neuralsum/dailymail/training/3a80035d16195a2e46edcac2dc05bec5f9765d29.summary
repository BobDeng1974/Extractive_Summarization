sir @entity0 claimed a thorough investigation found claims children were asked inappropriate questions were false @entity5 guidance at the heart of a major row over ‘ inappropriate ’ questions fired at primary pupils can be revealed for the first time today			1
for years inspectors have been internally briefed that they can quiz pupils aged four to 11 about the word ‘ gay ’ and same - sex families , it has emerged			1
they have been told to ask young children if classmates are ever picked on for not behaving like a ‘ typical girl ’ or a ‘ typical boy ’			0
and since 2013 @entity5 briefings have also urged inspectors to tackle ‘ transphobic ’ bullying , by asking primary children if they think someone ‘ born a girl who would rather be a boy , or born a boy who would like to be a girl ’ would feel safe at their school			1
@entity5 has repeatedly denied that youngsters have been questioned about ‘ inappropriate ’ topics since the introduction of new rules last year requiring schools to promote ‘ @entity36 ’ values			1
last week , sir @entity0 , the chief inspector of schools , told the @entity37 ’ education select committee that he had conducted a ‘ thorough ’ investigation into claims children were asked inappropriate questions and found them to be false			2
but as early as january 2012 , the schools watchdog published a briefing for inspectors , telling them they could quiz primary pupils about aspects of homophobic bullying such as the use of the word ‘ gay ’ in school			1
in september 2013 , the watchdog produced a new document , exploring @entity56 ’s actions to prevent and @entity57 and @entity58 , which endorses asking primary pupils wide - ranging questions about homosexuality and transgender			2
it said : ‘ inspectors should make sure that questions are age - appropriate and asked in the right context			0
‘ with primary pupils inspectors might explore whether pupils ever hear anyone use the word “ gay ” when describing something , or whether they have been told by teachers that using the word “ gay ” , to mean something is rubbish , is wrong , scary or unpleasant and why it is wrong			1
’ other topics to discuss included whether ‘ pupils ever get picked on by other children for not behaving like a “ typical girl ” or a “ typical boy ’ ’ ’ , and if they had lessons about ‘ different types of families ( single parent , living with grandparents , having step - parents , having two mums or two dads ) ’			0
this guidance , last issued in april 2014 , also suggested inspectors could discuss with primary children if they thought ‘ someone born a girl who would rather be a boy , or born a boy who would like to be a girl ’ would ‘ feel safe at school and be included ’			0
@entity100 in @entity101 has been put in special measures after the official @entity5 report found that discrimination ‘ persisted ’ there @entity106 is to close after a damning report which claimed pupils held ' discriminatory ' views at secondary level , inspectors were told to explore with students whether a pupil or teacher ‘ who thought of themselves as the opposite gender , feels safe and free from bullying at school ’			1
this ‘ briefing for section 5 inspection ’ – along with other @entity5 documents – were replaced by a new , single @entity119 , officially published last september , which makes no reference to these types of questions			2
two months later , @entity100 in @entity101 and @entity106 were inspected by @entity5			0
@entity100 , which has been put into special measures after children were labelled intolerant , has accused inspectors of questioning ten - year - olds about whether they knew what lesbians ‘ did ’ , and if any of their friends felt trapped in the ‘ wrong body ’			2
and @entity106 is set to close after @entity5 said some children displayed ‘ discriminatory ’ views towards people of other faiths			0
governors have claimed that inspectors asked pupils questions including ‘ do you know anybody in the school who is gay ? ’ it is also alleged a girl of around 12 was asked if she was a virgin			1
@entity145 , of @entity147 charity , said : ‘ it does look like @entity5 inspectors continue to be influenced by this guidance			0
‘ sir @entity0 needs to take responsibility for the actions of his inspectors			0
he also has to take responsibility for the fact that guidance has been issued that has created a culture within @entity5 where inspectors think it ’s appropriate to talk to young children in these ways			0
’ an @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ last year , @entity5 replaced a number of individual guidance documents with a new , single inspection handbook , in line with our new approach to placing more emphasis on training for inspectors rather than a reliance on extensive written guidance			2

since 2012 inspectors have been able to quiz pupils about the word ' gay '
briefings also urged tackling ' transphobic ' bullying among primary pupils
@entity5 has denied claims youngsters were inappropriately questioned
two schools *branded* ' intolerant ' and ' discriminatory ' after inspection
one alleged that pupils were asked if they knew what lesbians ' did '
