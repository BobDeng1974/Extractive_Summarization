financial accounts for @entity1 show their ' real ' losses last season were almost £ 70million - a figure that still leaves them facing a fine of more than £ 50m			1
the @entity9 's complex @entity8 rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs			0
a tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend			0
earlier this month @entity1 announced they had made a loss of £ 9.8m but the accounts filed at @entity20 now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of the owners , mainly @entity23 , writing off £ 60m of old loans in an ' exceptional item ' in the accounts			1
@entity1 owner @entity23 was among those to write off £ 60million of old loans to the @entity29 club @entity1 's players get put through their paces in training ahead of saturday 's game against @entity33 q : @entity1 accounts for 2013 - 14 have now been filed in detail at @entity20			1
what do they show ? a : they show that the club ’s ‘ true ’ losses for last season were £ 69.8m , instead of the £ 9.8m declared by the club earlier this month			2
they used an accounting method , an ‘ exceptional item ’ , to count a £ 60m write - off of loans to the owners as effective income			1
their real income was £ 38.7m			0
q : why does this matter ? a : because if clubs lose lots of money in the championship , where @entity1 played last season , they face potential ‘ @entity8 ’ fines from the @entity9			1
the @entity8 rules are in place to stop clubs ‘ financial doping ’ and stop them spending themselves to bankruptcy			0
to simplify : clubs that massively overspend , and lose lots of money as a result , face fans which grow in relation to the overspending			0
q : how much fine do @entity1 face ? a : if they ’d really lost only £ 9.8m last season , the fine would have been tiny , perhaps not even a million pounds			1
but if the real loss is £ 69.8m , the fine could be as high as £ 58m , and is likely to be at least £ 50m			1
that would be the biggest fine on any club for any reason in global football history			0
q : who will decide ? a : lawyers , probably			0
the parties are locked in talks about what happens next			0
q : what do @entity1 say ? a : no comment			0
effectively , @entity1 counted that £ 60m write - off as extra income			1
but that money is noted in the accounts as being a ' related - party transaction ' - and the @entity9 's own @entity8 rules explicitly rule out that related party moves of the kind @entity1 have undertaken			2
@entity103 rule out such moves in order to prevent ' artificially ' lowered losses			0
a @entity1 spokesman told @entity108 : ' we have no comment			0
' a @entity9 spokesman reiterated an earlier @entity9 statement that the @entity9 remains in talks with @entity1 about the situation , but wo n't add details			2
if the @entity9 ultimately rule that @entity1 's ' real ' losses are £ 69.8m , then the @entity8 fine they potentially face will be £ 57.9m			1
@entity1 will legitimately be able to write off some of that £ 69.8m as acceptable losses - for youth investment , and some bonuses , for example - but realistically they are looking at a fine of £ 50m - plus			1
yet @entity1 are locked in legal arguments questioning whether the @entity9 have the right to levy any fine at all , and if they do , at what levels			2
@entity1 posted losses of £ 65.4m in the 2012 - 13 season and it was expected these might fall after cost - cutting in the @entity132			2
but the new accounts show in fact that as @entity1 's income plunged from £ 60.6m in 2012 - 13 to £ 38.7m in 2013 - 14 , there was no significant reduction in the biggest single outgoing - player wages			2
the wage bill was £ 78m in the 2012 - 13 season and £ 75.4m in 2013 - 14 in the championship			0
quite how this now plays out remains to be seen : lawyers are likely to remain occupied for weeks if not months or years on both sides			0
@entity144 ( centre ) has an effort on goal as @entity1 prepare for a relegation clash at @entity149 striker @entity150 is in discussions over a new £ 60,000 - a - week deal at @entity153 @entity1 could refuse to pay a @entity9 fine if @entity155 keeps the club in the @entity157 if @entity1 avoid relegation from the @entity157 this season , they can continue to refuse to pay any fine levied and the @entity9 will not be able to force them to pay while they remain in the @entity157 - and outside @entity9 jurisdiction			1
the worst - case scenario for @entity1 is relegation to the @entity9 while continuing to refuse to pay a fine to the @entity9 , who have already said @entity1 would not be allowed back into the @entity132 if there was an outstanding fine unpaid			1
in other words , if @entity1 do n't pay what the @entity9 ultimately demand and go down , they face the nightmare prospect of a drop to non-league football			1
their lawyers are believed to be considering all options to prevent this .			0

@entity1 announced a loss of £ *9.8million* up to may 2014 earlier this month

the @entity29 club could face a @entity9 fine of more than £ 50m
they will not be allowed to play in the @entity132 if they do not pay
but @entity1 can not be forced to pay while they are in the @entity157
