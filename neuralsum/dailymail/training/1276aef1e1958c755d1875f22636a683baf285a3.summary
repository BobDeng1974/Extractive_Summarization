but he was forced to deny committing to billions of pounds of promises without saying how they would be paid for			0
borrowing : the @entity30 produced this list of policies which @entity12 has committed to the @entity30 produced a document dubbed a budget for borrowing , which points to pledges including cutting vat to 17.5 per cent , at a cost of £ 12.75billion , scrapping the one per cent cap on benefits rises worth £ 2.68billion and introducing a 10p starting rate of tax at a cost of £ 2billion			1
by contrast @entity12 has promised to raise only £ 105million from scrapping the winter fuel allowance for pensioners on the top rate of tax and reversing stamp duty changes to raise £ 145million			2
today mr @entity3 dismissed the claim that there is a £ 27.9 billion black hole in his party 's spending plans as ‘ nonsense ’			1
he insisted @entity12 would not increase borrowing to fund day to day spending in its first year of power if the party wins the next election			2
he told @entity79 's @entity78 : ‘ let me be clear , we have said in 2015/16 that @entity12 wo n't be borrowing more for day to day spending			2
‘ we have been absolutely clear about that			0
the next @entity12 government will be facing different circumstances from the last			0
‘ @entity86 and i have both said times are going to be tough and frankly i think treasury ministers should be worrying about the cost of living crisis facing families and not making up things about the @entity12			0

conservative treasury minister @entity100 said the £ 27.9 billion of unfunded policies in 2015 - 16 was the equivalent of £ 1,059 additional borrowing for every household			0
issues : when asked which party has the best policies on the economy , 38 per cent said the conservatives compared to just 20 per cent who said @entity12 mr @entity100 added : ‘ in the three months since @entity3 promised ‘ discipline ’ on borrowing , @entity12 have committed themselves to £ 27.9 billion of debt - funded spending – more than £ 1,000 of additional borrowing for every household			1
‘ this shows that @entity3 is too weak to deliver on his promises			2
‘ it ’s the same old @entity12			0
they still want more spending , more borrowing and more debt – exactly what got us into a mess in the first place			0
‘ and it ’s hardworking people who would pay the price through higher taxes and higher mortgage rates			0
’ clash : @entity79 interviewer @entity78 repeatedly pressed mr @entity3 on whether he would increase the minimum wage mr @entity3 repeatedly insisted he would take action to help families cope with rising cost of living			1

@entity12 claims the £ 6.19 rate for adults is now 45p lower than if it had kept pace with the rate of inflation			0
if increased to restore its value , someone working 37 hours - a - week would by £ 865 better off , before tax			0
but asked if the minimum wage should increase , mr @entity3 repeatedly refused commit to a rise			1
' the minimum wage must be set at a level where it is not going to cost jobs , that 's really important and so that 's what we have got to look at , ' he said			2
asked if the basic minimum wage would go up , he told @entity78 : ' that 's something we are going to look at			2
' i want to see the minimum wage go up over time but if i was coming on this programme and saying i 'm just going to pluck out of the air a figure of how much the minimum wage will go up by , you would say " is that really responsible ? "			2
' family affair : as the @entity12 conference got underway in @entity33 , mr @entity3 was joined by wife @entity176 take their children @entity178 ( right ) and @entity179 ( left ) for a walk along the beach mr @entity3 also said large firms will have to train up a @entity35 apprentice for every overseas worker they bring to the @entity35 while he would ensure apprenticeships in @entity35 are ' gold standard '			1
he believes the policy could result in the creation of 125,000 new apprentices over five years because the long - term solution for the @entity35 economy is to develop a highly skilled homegrown workforce .			0
