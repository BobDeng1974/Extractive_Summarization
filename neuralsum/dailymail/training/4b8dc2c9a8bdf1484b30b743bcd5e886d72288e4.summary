by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 06:27 est , 23 november 2012 a flower shop seller has told how he came face - to - face with ' @entity5 ' serial killer @entity3			1
@entity6 , 42 , was working the register at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , when the man charged with killing of three shopkeepers walked in last week			1
that kind of person is crazy			2
you never know what they can do , ' mr @entity6 told the @entity21			2
' i thought he was one of those guys that begs for money			2
' @entity3 , 63 , of @entity24 , has confessed to two of the killings after turning himself in to police			1
officers said he put himself at all three scenes but his motive is still unclear			1
before police knew his identity , the suspect was dubbed the ' @entity23 ' for the bag that he was seen carrying the most recent attack , which was visible in surveillance videos			1
@entity3 carried clothing in the duffel bag , which he had tried to tried to sell to the shopkeepers , police said			1
@entity49 commissioner @entity48 on wednesday called @entity3 a ' serial killer ' who is likely to have continued the murder spree			1
' i think it 's reasonable to assume that he was going to continue doing this , and , by arresting him , we saved lives , ' commissioner @entity48 said			0
weapon : police say that @entity3 used this rifle to kill three @entity10 shop keepers ' we know that he went to other locations and asked questions that indicated that			1
now that we look at them , he may very well have been planning to come back			0
' @entity49 spokesman @entity66 echoed commissioner @entity48 's sentiment , saying @entity3 did not show signs of stopping the mayhem on his own			1
' there was some concern he may have targeted another merchant , ' mr @entity66 said			0
the realization that the alleged sawed - off psycho was mere steps away sent chills through @entity6 ' veins			0
i bet those people ( who he shot ) did n't think anything was going to happen , either , ' @entity6 said			0
police recovered a bag containing a sawed - off rifle believed to have been used in the killings			2
the other killings happened in july and august			2
all three shopkeepers were men alone in stores that had no video cameras			1
after being questioned by detectives for hours , @entity90 admitted to the slayings of @entity93 , 65 , in @entity94 and @entity95 , 59 , in @entity96			1
in the most recent killing , @entity97 , an @entity98 , was shot three times in the head and chest at his store , the @entity104			0
after that killing , detectives discovered the same gun was used in the fatal shootings of two other shopkeepers when ballistics matched the .22 - caliber gun shell casings on all three			1
on july 6 , @entity93 , an @entity111 , was found shot in the back of his shop , @entity115 on august 6 , @entity116 , also @entity111 , was shot in the head in his store , amazing 99 @entity119			1
the suspect was taken into police custody after he voluntarily entered the @entity122 in @entity94			0
he was later transferred to another police location for additional questioning			0
revealed : the balding , mustachioed man dubbed ' @entity127 ' who was seen near at least two crime scenes in @entity9 voluntarily submitted himself for questioning ballistics tests matched in each killing , all of which occurred in @entity9 shops with an ' 8 ' in the address			1
@entity90 was caught on surveillance footage a block and a half away from the @entity140 store where @entity97 was killed on last friday evening			1
minutes later , the same moustachioed - man is seen in a different video two blocks away from the store			0
murdered : @entity145 was killed with three gunshots , but it seems nothing was stolen the @entity149 reports that a different surveillance camera , located by the scene of the second murder in @entity96 also shows the same man			2
the video is of poorer quality , but they feel confident that the same duffel bag - toting man was in the area around the time that shopkeeper @entity95 was killed on august 2			0
‘ ” @entity161 ” wore a long overcoat and carried a duffel bag , ’ police commissioner @entity160 said			0
‘ he was seen in the vicinity of @entity97 ’s store just after 6pm			0
the shop owner ’s body was found at 7.11pm			1
’ this is not the first person - of - interest in the case , and a number have since been ruled out			0
previously unidentified suspects , dubbed ‘ @entity173 ’ and ‘ @entity174 ’ , were on the police ’s watch list since they were seen in the area of @entity97 ’s shop at the time of the murder			2
they have since been eliminated from the suspect pool as it turns out that ‘ @entity173 ’ stole a bottle of perfume from street vendor ‘ @entity174 ’ who was chasing after her following the theft			0
two remaining possibilities are ‘ @entity189 ’ , a woman who was seen near the crime scene wearing sunglasses and a scarf			2
looking for the man : he appeared near at least two of the three crime scenes over the past four months near the scene : none of the stores where the shootings took place had video cameras inside there also was a police sketch released following the first murder that took place earlier in the summer at a 99 cent store that left @entity93 dead on july 6			1
that possible suspect was a man with dark skin and wearing sunglasses , who witnesses described as being ‘ disturbed ’ and talking to himself about putting a bullet in someone ’s head			0
that man is said to be roughly 5ft 5in and around 140lbs			0
the @entity21 reports that the shop owner @entity218 was behind the counter of she she in @entity9 's @entity140 section when he was shot			1
the gunman dragged the victim 's body toward the back of the store and covered it with clothing			0
victims : @entity95 and @entity93 were killed by the same handgun earlier this year police found the 78 - year - old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso , @entity230 reported			1
on the floor of the shop were the killer 's calling card : shell casings matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides			1
' now it 's like he 's telling us , ' it 's me again , '' a police source told the @entity21			0
casings that police have matched to two other murders			2
“ now it ’s like he ’s telling us , ‘ it ’s me again , ’ ” a police source said			0
the way @entity145 's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings			0
on july 6 , @entity93 , 65 , was found shot through the neck in his @entity94 clothing shop			1
his body was also hidden			0
police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies			2
' i hope they catch the son of a b * * * * , ' @entity93 's son , @entity269 said			0
when @entity276 did n't come home at the usual time friday his family called the police , who discovered his body			0
it was n't not clear if the killer actually took anything , or if the murder was his sole motivation			2
' he never had in his whole life one enemy , he did n't have , he was a very kind man , ' his sobbing wife , @entity286 , told reporters			0
suspect : following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun , police released this sketch of the suspect he was supposed to be at his grandson ’s @entity297 last saturday			0
police believe the murderer had been watching the store in preparation for the attack , noting that he 'd chosen a shop with no security cameras			1
@entity306 , 59 , was found dead in his @entity96 store at 1877 86th street , was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck			2
besides owning stores , each victim was of @entity313 descent , prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated			1
it appeared nothing was taken from @entity145 's shop but both @entity116 and @entity93 had money taken from them , and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive			2
unguarded : believe the killer was attracted to the store because , as with previous crime scenes , there were no cameras @entity326 , of the @entity327 of the @entity328 , said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim 's description			1
' the only members that we would be concerned about are @entity313 , ' he said			0
it 's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology , as the address for each homicide includes the number 8 : @entity116 at 1877 86th @entity346 , @entity93 at 7718 5th avenue , and @entity145 at 834 @entity347			2
none of the stores had working surveillance cameras			1
scene : police believe the killer may have been casing the shop , as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act neighbors called @entity276 a ' neighborhood staple			1
' ' he was a regular guy , ' said customer @entity360			0
' he never hurt nobody			0
' video : surveillance shows ' @entity127 ' near two different crime scenes			1

@entity3 , of @entity24 , walked into @entity9 flower shop
@entity90 ' confesses to two of the killings ' but not the third
casings from the same .22 caliber handgun found at all three crime scenes
killer may have chosen stores based on lack of surveillance cameras
