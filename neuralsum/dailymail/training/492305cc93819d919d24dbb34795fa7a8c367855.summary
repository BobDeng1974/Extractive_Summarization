he said : ' once i knew i could n't save the van i thought " my tools , my livelihood "			2

' following the fire , and on the day the first tv adverts for e-cigarettes went on air , fire chiefs in @entity135 issued tips on the safe charging of the devices			1
head of community safety for the service @entity144 said : ' fires caused by e-cigarettes are an emerging trend which , two years ago , simply did not exist			1
' whilst e-cigs may offer a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes , they are so popular now we do need to make sure people know how charge them safely			0
' the advice for e-cigs is really the same as for many smaller electrical appliances like mobile phones and laptops - do n't be tempted to buy cheap unbranded chargers , do n't leave them to charge whilst you are out of the house or asleep and keep them well away from flammable materials			0
' the safety warning was released on the day the first advert for e-cigarettes was due to hit @entity167 screens mr @entity144 said fire investigators think fires start because e-cigarettes are left to charge too long , they are charged too close to soft furnishings or because the charger itself is faulty			1
recent figures reveal electronic cigarettes have been linked to more than 100 fires			1
fire services in the @entity179 are now attending at least one blaze involving the devices each week , statistics suggest			1
they have attended dozens of incidents suspected to have been sparked by e-cigarettes or related equipment including chargers in less than three years			0
firefighters have told e-cigarette users to : - charge the device on a flat , solid and stable surface , such as a kitchen worktop ; - keep the device away from flammable or combustible materials when charging ; - never leave the device on a bed or close to soft furnishings , or in a cluttered space ; - do n’t exceed the recommended charging time , or leave unattended for any significant length of time e.g. overnight while you ’re asleep , or if you go out ; - do n’t buy cheap , unbranded chargers and always follow the manufacturer ’s instructions			1
e-cigarette chargers , like this one which set fire to a building in @entity205 , are behind one blaze a week			1
