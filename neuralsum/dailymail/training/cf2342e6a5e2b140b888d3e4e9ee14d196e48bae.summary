we 've had a freezing past few days in @entity1 and i 've come to accept the fact that winter is now here to stay			0
although i love a good night out , with the colder weather it 's so much more tempting to stay in with a cup of tea and a dvd			1
every once in a while it 's nice to sit back , relax and have some well - deserved ' me time ' , as well as pampering my face , body and hair with all my favourite beauty bits			1
@entity23 night in for me , there 's no better way to start a relaxing evening in than a hot bubble bath			2
i love the sensuous indulgent aroma of the @entity28 , which is made up of natural ingredients to relax the body and mind			0
if i 'm feeling particularly stressed i also add in a few drops of the ultra-calming lavender and mandarin scented @entity35			0
while relaxing in the bath i 'll usually apply a cream face mask to rejuvenate my skin			1
as i wear a lot of make - up during the week , it 's important for me to keep my skin fresh and hydrated so it does n't end up looking sallow			2
the @entity42 has a velvety gel - cream texture which is super-soothing on the skin and leaves it looking glowing			2
@entity17 says that it is important to rejuvenate your skin and hair with masks as i use a lot of heated appliances on my hair during the week , when i 'm having a pamper evening i also take the opportunity to treat and repair my locks with an intensive conditioning mask such as @entity57			1
moisturising your body after bathing can sometimes be a tedious task , but not when you 're using a gorgeous smelling body butter like @entity62			0
@entity17 's essentials for a @entity64 the thick , comforting formula leaves skin feeling nourished and supple without leaving any greasy residue – plus the cream 's marshmallow and sweet almond extract means your body will be smelling divine for hours			1
long baths can sometimes dry your hands out , so i always use the luxurious rose - scented @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 after bathing – its light , nourishing texture leaves my hands feeling amazingly soft			0
once i 've slipped on a fluffy dressing gown and settled myself in front of the tv , i like to relax with a cooling gel face mask like the @entity85 to keep my skin feeling plumped and refreshed , as well as reducing any redness or agitation on my face			2
simply leave on and chill out for 20 minutes to reveal a thoroughly more radiant complexion			0
these are @entity17 's pampering picks for a luxurious night in if you suffer from under eye bags , i thoroughly recommend the @entity94			1
place the cooling gel patches under your eyes for around half an hour for visibly brighter and more awake - looking peepers			0
perfect if you 've had a heavy weekend ! to round off my pamper evening , i love lighting a scented candle like @entity100 in @entity101 – which fills my whole bedroom with a beautifully crisp , fresh aroma – and painting my nails a new shade ready for the week ahead			1
i tend to opt for deep , dark and mysterious tones on my talons during the colder months ; my current favourites are @entity109 in the shimmering indigo blue hue @entity111 and my very own @entity112 in @entity113			0
hope you enjoyed reading about my perfect relaxing evening in – you can get all the products i mentioned from @entity116			1
will you be planning something similar soon ? i 'd love to hear what pampering products you 'd go for ! love @entity120 xxx			0
