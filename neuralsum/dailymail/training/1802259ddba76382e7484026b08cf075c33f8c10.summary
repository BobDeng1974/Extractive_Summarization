the campaign to save the @entity2 has increased its lead over @entity5 ’s push for @entity7 independence , a new poll revealed today			1
the @entity9 survey showed 54 per cent of @entity7 plan to vote no in thursday ’s historic referendum , with 46 per cent backing the nationalists			1
it is a dramatic turnaround from a week ago when a poll put the @entity15 campaign ahead , and sent @entity16 into panic mode fearing the @entity2 was days away from separation			0
numbers also showed that those in the @entity36 of the country were most likely to vote @entity15 , while those in the @entity39 favoured no the last week has been dominated by warnings from banks , shops and oil companies about the risks of independence , including rising prices and jobs being relocated to @entity48			1
the latest @entity9 survey , commissioned by the @entity51 campaign , suggests it has persuaded more voters to swing behind the @entity53			1
polling experts said it would be difficult for mr @entity5 to make up the lost ground with only five days left until polling day			1
some 40 per cent of those surveyed say they and their families would be financially worse off if @entity7 goes it alone , compared to 27 per cent who believe they would be better off			2
survey also points to a very high turnout with 93 per cent of voters saying they are certain to vote			2
men are split exactly , with 50 per cent support independence and 50 per cent opposed			2
among women , 57 per cent plan to vote no with only 43 per cent in favour			1
the breakdown of the poll showed that support for independence is highest among 35 - 44 - year - olds , at 58.5 per cent , and lowest among the over 65s , with just 33 per cent backing the break - up of the @entity2			2
the @entity36 of @entity7 is the most pro-independence region of @entity7 ( 54 per cent ) with the south most supportive of the @entity53 ( 30 per cent )			1
just 9 per cent of those surveyed say they have yet to make up their minds about which way they will vote			2
professor @entity82 , an expert in political polling , wrote on his blog : ‘ @entity9 continue to fail to find any evidence of a swing to @entity15 in recent weeks			1
that will undoubtedly be disappointing for the @entity15 side			0
‘ but otherwise this poll clearly confirms the message of many another poll that the referendum race is now tight , albeit one in which the no side still appear to have the edge			0
the news will come as a fresh blow to @entity5 after businesses warned this week of rising prices and job losses if he secures a @entity15 vote on september 18 with almost all @entity104 voters in @entity7 vowing to vote no , @entity102 has deployed former home secretary @entity105 and @entity106 mp to shore up their base @entity108 has also travelled to @entity7 this week in order to fight for the no campaign ‘ the poll also suggests that gaining further ground could well prove far from easy for the @entity15 side			1
’ @entity113 , @entity114 , said : ‘ this poll suggests that @entity116 are in the lead but that the race is far from over			2
‘ no - one can afford a protest vote			2
any one of us could cast the vote that makes the difference between the @entity2 staying together or breaking apart			0
‘ this week employers and retailers have set out the real economic costs of separation			0
they have made it clear that jobs will be lost and that prices will rise if there is a yes vote			0
‘ when we can have better , safer , faster change as part of the @entity2 , why should we risk the costs of separation			0
’ a @entity137 spokesman said : ‘ this poll records support for @entity15 at 46.5 per cent , and an @entity140 poll conducted around the same time put @entity15 at 49 per cent			0
there is everything to play for , and this will spur on everybody who wants and is working hard for a yes to redouble their efforts			0
' as we say in response to all the polls , we are working flat out to ensure that we achieve a @entity15 vote , because it 's the biggest opportunity the people of @entity7 will ever have to build a fairer society and more prosperous economy			1
' a yes vote is our one opportunity to achieve job - creating powers , protect our @entity158 from the damaging impact of @entity16 privatisation and cuts , and ensure that never again do we get @entity104 governments imposed on @entity7 that we have roundly rejected			1
' the poll will be a bitter blow for mr @entity5 , who was today forced to deny he is plotting a ’ day of reckoning ’ against businesses opposed to his dream of independence			1

mr @entity174 retaliated by saying that oil giant @entity187 would be nationalised ' in part or in whole ' , while bankers and ' scaremongering ' big business chiefs would be punished for ' being in cahoots ' with the @entity214			0
he added : ’ this referendum is about power , and when we get a @entity15 majority , we will use that power for a day of reckoning with @entity187 and the banks			2
’ the incendiary remark threatened to overshadow the last weekend of campaigning ahead of the referendum on thursday			0
the @entity225 claimed ’ intimidation is the tactic of choice ’ for the @entity15 campaign			0
in an attempt to quell the deeply damaging row , mr @entity5 today rushed out a statement attempting to reassure businesses they have nothing to fear if @entity7 goes it alone			1
mr @entity5 said : ’ @entity174 is a great campaigner who has put aside his personal grief over the loss of his wife @entity237 to put his heart and soul into galvanising the @entity15 vote			1
’ he is fighting a fine campaign all over @entity7 - but the day after a @entity15 vote will be a day of celebration for the people , not reckoning for big companies drawn into the no campaign by @entity247			1
’ he added that mr @entity174 was ’ simply trying to express the anger felt by so many people about the revelations that some supermarket statements were orchestrated by the prime minister himself ’			0
better together insiders say the biggest battle is being fought in the @entity256 , where @entity102 has launched a massive operation to stop its working class supporters from backing independence			1

hundreds of people gathered on @entity279 with @entity280 , vote no placards mr @entity106 said : ’ i 've lost most of my voice but i do n't think we 've lost the argument			0
’ the nearer it gets , a lot of the undecided voters have looked into the precipice and they 've stepped back			0
’ mr @entity105 said : ’ the arguments are coming down to two very simple questions			0
’ do you want to retain @entity7 's history , culture , control over its own affairs within a bigger state that allows us financial stability , economic growth and and the best of both worlds ? ’ or do you want to go a separate route with all the dangers , which are now becoming obvious , to pensions , jobs , investment and security ? ’ as part of the @entity102 push , former prime minster @entity108 used a @entity310 at an event in @entity312 to say : ’ i yield to no one in my patriotism and my pride in @entity7			1
