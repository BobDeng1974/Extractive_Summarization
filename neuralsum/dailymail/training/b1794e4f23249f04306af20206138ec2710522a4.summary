by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:19 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 09:07 est , 7 february 2013 finger pointing : dr @entity2 , who was the hospital 's director of nursing from 2006 to 2009 , was cleared of any wrongdoing at a private disciplinary hearing this month almost 70 medical staff who faced disciplinary action after 1,200 patients died needlessly at @entity9 have already been cleared in secret hearings , including the most senior nurse at the height of the scandal			1
@entity2 was director of nursing from 2006 to 2009 when care reached ' appalling ' standards , yet has been told she has ' no case to answer ' and is now working as a management consultant			1
in the last few years 29 nurses and 38 doctors from @entity9 - 67 in total - were cleared at private hearings that considered complaints that will never be made public			1
the allegations , made by police , the public and other medical staff , were all thrown out at an early stage , so regulators refuse to publish the details			1
a report by @entity31 published yesterday highlighted the ' appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of patients ' in @entity34 , as the prime minister revealed that nobody has been struck off or disciplined for their part in the biggest @entity40 scandal in history			2
the sick and vulnerable were left for hours sitting in their own urine and excrement , drink was left out of reach forcing them to glug water from vases and hygiene was so poor that relatives had to clean toilets themselves			2
@entity53 , whose mother @entity54 died in harrowing circumstances at @entity9 , says she has been inundated with complaints from others from all over @entity58 about about @entity40 standards			1
speaking about the lack of disciplinary action following the scandal she told the @entity63 : ‘ i ’d like to say i was surprised , but i ’m not			1
this is how the @entity40 is			2
it is one big roundabout where they get on , fail , and then get on somewhere else			2
‘ those in charge then ( at @entity34 ) have already gone , resigned and gone to other jobs with huge pay packets			2
‘ the chief executive was so unwell he could n’t give evidence to the ( @entity74 , but he has made a mockery of it because he is now working for another organisation in the area			1
‘ we need radical action			1
we need leaders in the @entity40			0
something has gone terribly wrong and unless we make a stand now we will lose the @entity40			0
just rewarding people for failure can not continue			0
’ targets : this wall in @entity34 is adorned with names campaigners blame for poor standards , including current head of the @entity40 @entity92 and head of nursing @entity2 victims : face after face of those who died at @entity34 are pasted on the wall along with details and tributes upsetting : the pictures not only show the dead but also the painful injuries they received when they were supposed to be cared for in total , 29 nurses who worked at @entity9 during its darkest days have been cleared of wrongdoing in private ' @entity107 ' hearings held by regulator the @entity108			1
under pressure : @entity40 chief executive sir @entity92 is refusing to resign despite calls for his head this is the first stage of the process which decides whether there is a case to answer			1
two individuals have been cleared in public , with ten more still facing charges at future hearings			1
meanwhile 42 doctors were referred to the @entity121 during the scandal , but only four face a public hearing			1
figures given to @entity125 show 22 doctors were given ' advice ’ but no punishment , and 21 were told they had no case to answer			1
healthcare assistant @entity130 faces a hearing next week after she was accused of dragging a 73 - year - old patient around by the collar of his pyjamas			1
ms @entity130 joined @entity9 at the end of its scandal and allegedly abused @entity137 on a night shift and told him ' you are no longer a human being but an animal '			0
nurse @entity143 will also face the @entity108 hearing , accused of telling fellow nurses in 2008 a patient with heart problems was well			1
but the critically ill woman was not breathing and died shortly afterwards			1
despite this incident she was allowed to carry on working there for two more years , until she was accused of ill - treating a patient by ignoring her repeated requests to be taken to the toilet			1
nurses who worked in the hospital complained of bullying from the top down , with senior staff ' ruling with fear ' and treating patients ' like an inconvenience '			2
scandal : @entity53 ( c ) , of ' cure the @entity40 ' , whose mother @entity54 , 86 , died while a patient at @entity165 , speaks to the media outside the @entity167 yesterday at risk : ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at @entity9 ( pictured ) and @entity175 are ' dotted around ' the @entity40 @entity176 told the @entity177 that she tried to raise the alarm , said : ' it went right to the top that people did n’t want to know			1
and i think that ’s why things got so extreme at @entity34			0
' after being cleared at a hearing on january 23 this year , after a @entity108 panel considered two complaints , @entity2 now works for @entity187 as a consultant			1
her company won a contract to look at the financial viability of @entity192 , but @entity187 confirmed she would not be working on it			0
they also told @entity125 she was not available for comment			0
ms @entity2 was director of nursing at the time , and took over from @entity197 , 60 , who has been suspended pending a @entity108 hearing in march			1
tragic : 86 - year - old @entity200 died while she was a patient at @entity165 and her daughter @entity201 has been bent on improving standards ever since campaigner @entity53 is furious that not one member of staff has been disciplined or struck off following the scandal			2
the families of those who suffered in @entity208 have called for @entity40 chief sir @entity92 , who oversaw standards at @entity34 during the scandal , and @entity211 ( @entity211 ) chief executive @entity212 to resign			0
' from all over the country i get emails asking for help , help for the complaints procedure , people that are actually suffering on the wards today , asking for help , from the particular hospitals that have been identified last night , but also other hospitals ' , miss @entity53 said			2
' i can take these complaints down to particular wards within hospitals , they are so frequent , but there 's just nobody to help these people , and this is the huge problem that 's going on throughout the whole of the country			2
' we know the @entity40 does some wonderful things but we also know it 's doing some awful things to people , and they 're our most vulnerable			0
' in a growing crisis for the @entity40 it has also two other @entity58 hospitals are now facing legal action from 18 people whose loved - ones had their human rights breached with sub-standard care , it was also revealed today			2
the @entity63 says claimants are targeting the @entity248 in @entity249 in @entity250 and @entity251 and blame them for early deaths			0
yesterday it emerged that five more trusts - @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 and @entity259 - are to be investigated after they had higher - than - average death rates for two years running			0
the damning report into the scandal at @entity9 points ' very clearly ' to the cultural changes the @entity40 has needed for a ' very long time ' , former health secretary @entity261 said today			0
mr @entity261 , who left the job in last september 's cabinet reshuffle , said his controversial reforms , which will see gp commissioning bodies manage services from this april , would not necessarily have prevented the scandal , but they will make @entity40 trusts more accountable to patients			0
his comments came as it emerged @entity275 had demanded a @entity277 debate on the findings of @entity31 's report into @entity280 between 2005 and 2009 , which was published yesterday			1
it highlighted an ' appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of patients ' , many of whom were left for hours sitting in their own faeces , while food and drink was left out of reach and hygiene was so poor that relatives had to clean toilets themselves			0
mr @entity261 , now @entity293 , told @entity275 his reforms to the structure of the way services were managed now meant it was possible to change the culture of the @entity40			0
he said : ' many members in this @entity301 will understandably feel very strongly about what @entity31 had to say in his report			0
i feel pretty strongly about it			0
' i think it absolutely demonstrates that it was the right thing to do to appoint @entity31 to undertake that public inquiry and i think it points very clearly to the kind of changes in culture and behaviour that the @entity40 needs now and has needed for a long time			2
' this is not about the structures , because frankly i think in this @entity301 in the course of these last two and a half years we have given the @entity40 the structures that it needs			0
' @entity31 in the introduction to his report makes clear that it is now about achieving those culture changes within the structure of the new reforms and it can be achieved in that way			0
' @entity326 mps said they also wanted to see the @entity40 reformed			0
@entity327 ( @entity328 ) : ' after what we learnt yesterday about the culture of box - ticking managerialism at the hospital , it seems to me that those people who close their eyes to reform of the @entity40 should open them and let 's get on with it			0
' @entity340 ( @entity341 ) said there was an ' evident lack of democratic accountability ' in the @entity40 .			0

@entity177 found 1,200 died unnecessarily between 2005 and 2009
but 29 nurses and 38 doctors accused of wrongdoing face no action
complaints they faced will never be made public , @entity121 and @entity108 say
head of nursing @entity2 cleared privately last week and is a consultant
