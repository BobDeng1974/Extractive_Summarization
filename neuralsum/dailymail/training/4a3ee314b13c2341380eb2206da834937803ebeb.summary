by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 showed a glimpse of his undoubted quality by inspiring @entity5 to an unlikely comeback victory against @entity7 - a performance manager @entity8 is confident the club - record signing will start producing with increasing regularity			1
many had written off the 22 - year - old after an injury - disrupted first season at @entity5 in which he managed a measly three league starts			1
quality : @entity2 skips away from @entity16 of @entity17 after coming on and changing the game delight : @entity2 celebrates the first goal with scorer @entity21 after providing the assist it was miserable start to life at @entity26 for the man billed as @entity29 's heir , but there are at last signs that the @entity32 could fulfil his potential with the north @entity34			1
after a decent display in the season - opening win at @entity37 , @entity8 threw @entity2 on after 72 minutes in @entity38 with his side losing to an early @entity41 goal in the first leg of their @entity44 play - off			1
it proved an inspired alteration as within six minutes of his introduction not only had he provided the assist for @entity21 's exquisite first - time leveller but he went on to set - up @entity51 to secure an unlikely 2 - 1 win			2

' it is true that it was difficult for him			0
improvement : after a difficult first season @entity2 is beginning to show flashes of his top - class talent ' he was injured , too , and we are confident with him that with time and hard work , like he has done in pre-season , that he can go far			1
' he was very disappointed about last season but the past is the past			2
' we need him to look forward , believe in his skill and condition and work very , very hard			0
with confidence and time he will show his value			0
' you always nominate players on the bench who can have an impact and all three subs had an impact on the game			2
' taking the lead : @entity83 striker @entity51 celebrates putting his side ahead ten minutes from time @entity2 twice came close to capping his impressive display with a goal in the closing stages and is in line to start sunday 's match with @entity91			1
it is a match in which @entity5 will need a much improved performance to secure a positive result , with @entity8 suggesting complacency may have inadvertently slipped in at the @entity96			1
' i think it was a very tough game a difficult game , a hard game because he conditions were difficult and the weather was difficult , ' he said , referring to the bobbly , cut - up pitch and temperatures in the 30s			0

in the end 2 - 1 for us is an important result for us			0
' it is true that in the first half we started to make mistakes , but in general , i am happy and looking forward to the next game , on sunday			0
' we created two or three chances in the first seven minutes			0
