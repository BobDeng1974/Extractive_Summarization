@entity1 communications director @entity0 used his official @entity4 @entity3 account to recommend a story undermining the @entity7 story of an aging cancer sufferer concerned about her health care president @entity1 's top communications strategist sparked outrage on monday after tweeting a blog entry that belittled a cancer sufferer 's concerns about losing her doctor and insurance because of @entity19			1
@entity20 , a @entity21 woman with stage - 4 gallbladder cancer , wrote a powerful @entity23 op - ed that she will soon lose her medical insurance – and access to her life - saving oncologists – as a direct result of the @entity19			1
but @entity29 , a far - left blog , countered with an article claiming that her insurance company , @entity32 , left her in the lurch because it chose to abandon the individual insurance market for financial reasons			1
@entity0 , the @entity4 communications director , tweeted a link to that story , titled ' @entity40 ’s @entity23 lost her insurance			1
' the impact on @entity3 was both fast and furious , since @entity0 's @entity3 feed is an ' official ' @entity4 account , meaning that it speaks for the administration			2
@entity20 , who has battled her cancer since 2007 , had explained that she is ' one of the losers ' in the president 's signature health insurance overhaul			1
cancer specialists at @entity52 have ' kept me alive , ' she wrote , ' but @entity54 has provided emergency and local treatment support during wretched periods of this disease , and it is where my primary - care doctors are			2
' both hospitals , and the doctors who practice in them , are covered by her current @entity63 but covered @entity21 , the state 's @entity19 insurance exchange , does n't offer a single plan that both @entity52 and @entity54 's medical centers will accept			2
and , citing unfair tax breaks its competitors enjoy , @entity32 has said it plans to pull out of @entity21 's individual insurance market entirely , leaving @entity72 with few options			2
' but this luck may have just run out : my affordable , lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective december 31			0
' @entity29 argued that @entity32 selfishly ' packed its bags and dumped its beneficiaries because it wants its competitors to swallow the first wave of sicker enrollees ' on the government - run exchange			2
@entity0 's tweet may have been a small gesture , but it set off a firestorm of responses to the unusual step of a @entity4 communications czar using a partisan blog to fire a rhetorical fusillade against a terminally ill taxpayer			1
so this is what a complete lack of self - awareness and moral judgement looks like , ' tweeted @entity114 strategist @entity113			0
@entity0 's @entity3 feed is an ' official ' @entity4 account , giving his tweets extra weight since he 's presumed to be speaking for the @entity1 administration he sent out this link to a @entity29 article to all his followers world - class care : @entity54 ( pictured ) , where her primary care doctors are based , does not accept the same exchange plan as @entity52 , where her primary oncologist is based @entity131 oped editor @entity130 took issue with that assessment			1
' so failure to provide sufficient empathy is an " attack , " ' he tweeted			0
' wait until that standard gets used against the next @entity114 prez			0
' @entity143 , one of the late @entity145 football coach @entity144 's sons and a one - time congressional candidate , fired off : ' [ @entity148 ] o , the bait and switch from the obvious lie is to " its all the insurance companies ' fault ? " shocking			0
' @entity20 also focused on that presidential campaign ' lie ' in her op - ed. ' what happened to the president 's promise , " you can keep your health plan " ? or to the promise that " you can keep your doctor " ? ' she wrote			1
' thanks to the law , i have been forced to give up a world - class health plan			0
the exchange would force me to give up a world - class physician			0
perhaps that 's the point			0
' ' @entity167 promises ' : @entity1 has previously said that people will not lose their healthcare plans or their doctors - but @entity20 said that is not the case for her and demands to know why @entity23 online editorial page editor @entity174 came to @entity20 's defense on monday afternoon , with a biting column titled ' how low can they go ? ' @entity0 ( r ) is close to @entity1 , meaning that his tweets provide the impression that he 's speaking for the president he called @entity182 a ' fast - talking flack ' and @entity29 – the house blog of a group run by former clinton white house chief of staff @entity186 – ' a leftist propaganda outfit			1
' @entity174 also blamed ' the regulatory structure established by @entity1 's comprehensive " reform " , ' not avarice on @entity32 's part , for the company 's decision to cancel @entity20 's plan			1
her op - ed heaped fuel on an @entity19 fire that has seen more than insurance companies cancel the policies of more than 2 million @entity201 , with more expected by month 's end			1
@entity20 added to @entity203 : ' what i would like to see happen as a result of my op - ed is for the @entity201 people to insist that the executive branch and @entity210 ( and even federal employees ) all sign up for health insurance on the exchanges			1
' that is the right thing to do			0
and is the surest way to fix any problems with the exchanges and our healthcare system			0
' many @entity201 forced to seek insurance in the @entity19 exchanges have found higher premium rates , along with higher deductible rates and narrowed networks of covered physicians and hospitals			2
the enrollment process has also been plagued by software and data entry problems , which led @entity231 secretary @entity230 to offer an apology to a @entity233 last week			0
@entity230 called the enrollment software problems a ' debacle ' and ' a miserably frustrating experience for way too many @entity201			0

@entity0 , the top @entity4 communications strategist , tweeted out a liberal organization 's hit piece on @entity76 's insurance company
@entity0 has one of the few ' official ' @entity4 @entity3 accounts
the story ran on the @entity29 blog , a project of the @entity248 – run by a former clinton white house chief of staff
it alleged @entity20 's now - famous health insurance limbo is @entity32 's fault , not @entity19 's
@entity20 , who has battled gallbladder cancer for nearly seven years , wrote a @entity23 op - ed about how @entity19 will affect her health
her insurance plan will be canceled next month , leaving her to choose between one government plan that wo n't cover her primary care doctor and another that wo n't cover her oncologist
@entity1 had claimed @entity201 could keep their doctors after @entity19 became law : ' what happened to the president 's promises ? ' she asked
