by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor former chancellor @entity2 warned the risks of independence are ' bigger ' than the banking crash @entity7 independence would cause more damage to the @entity9 than the banking crash in 2008 , @entity2 has warned			1
the former @entity2 said the risks of @entity7 going it alone ‘ are colossal ’ and there will be no going back			1
and he warned allegations that @entity16 ’s pro-independence campaign is intimidating business from speaking out brings ‘ shame on our country ’			1
voters in @entity7 will decide whether @entity7 should become an independent country in an historic referendum on september 18			1
with less than three months to go , the battle between the two camps has become increasingly bitter			2
support for independence has remained flat , or fallen , despite mr @entity16 ’s team stepping the push for breaking up the @entity30			1
in an interview with @entity32 , mr @entity2 said voters ’ minds are starting to focus on the idea of @entity7 leaking the @entity9 , and they do not like it			1
‘ people can now see the finishing post , ’ he said			2
‘ in 2012 and 2013 , the referendum was n't really real			2
it was like asking someone the day after a general election , how they would vote at the next election - it was a completely free hit			1
’ he said the ‘ sheer magnitude of the decision ’ is looming large in people 's minds			2
‘ it 's not like a general or @entity52 election , when you can vote for somebody else next time around			1
this is probably the biggest political decision they will ever take in their lives			2
‘ more and more people are saying the risks are colossal and there is no guarantee whatsoever that there would be anything to gain from it			1
that 's why people are saying : ' i am not buying this '			2
’ mr @entity2 , who was chancellor in the @entity69 government when the banking crisis hit in 2008 , said the ramifications of independence would be even greater			1
the @entity9 taxpayer spent £ 66billion bailing out failing banks , including @entity75 and @entity76			1
‘ being told the world 's largest bank has three hours before it collapses does provide a shock to the system , ’ mr @entity2			1
‘ but the decision on @entity7 is forever			2
it 's irrevocable , irreversible			1
if we get it wrong , it will have a profound effect , not just on @entity7 , but the rest of the @entity9			2
' the stakes in the banking crisis were big ; this is so much bigger			1
’ voters in @entity7 will decide whether @entity7 should become an independent country in an historic referendum on september 18 tensions have been rising in the campaign over allegations the @entity7 government has sought to silence business who support the @entity30			1
five company bosses told the @entity101 dispatches show they were contacted by the @entity102 and ‘ felt pressurised to stay quiet about their views ’ , while the former chief executive of the @entity106 said @entity108 leader @entity107 had tried to ‘ neuter business comment ’			1
last week , prime minister @entity110 also accused the @entity111 of making ‘ threats and warnings ’ to businesses			0
mr @entity2 added : ‘ it is shining a light on @entity7 that frankly brings shame on our country			0
when i first heard about it over two years ago , i did not believe it			0
now people are speaking out because it is happening to so many people			0
‘ what worries me is that , if @entity7 became independent , the same people doing these things would be in government			0
it strikes at the heart of the campaign and the conduct of public life			0
it should not be tolerated			0
’ @entity16 has been accused of trying to ' intimidate ' one of @entity7 's most senior industry leaders as the @entity108 ' bullying ' scandal deepened last night			1
@entity136 , chief executive of the @entity137 , claimed the first minister made a ' wholly unacceptable ' attempt to silence him when he posed questions about independence			1
mr @entity136 described a personal letter from mr @entity16 as an ' attempt to snarl hard enough at us to intimidate us from asking further questions '			1
first minister @entity16 has faced claims his party has put pressure on businesses to speak out against independence the accusation , which has been strenuously denied by the @entity102 , comes after a tv documentary last night highlighted similar claims of threatening behaviour by ministers			1
five company bosses told the @entity101 dispatches show they were contacted by the @entity102 and ' felt pressurised to stay quiet about their views ' , while the former chief executive of the @entity106 said @entity108 leader @entity107 had tried to ' neuter business comment '			1
last week , prime minister @entity110 also accused the @entity111 of making ' threats and warnings ' to businesses			0
mr @entity136 wrote to mr @entity16 in may after the @entity108 leader used a speech in @entity163 to suggest that foreign fishermen would be banned from an independent @entity7 's waters unless @entity167 governments met his demands on @entity170 membership			1
the head of @entity9 's diplomatic service has warned that @entity7 may have to pay for emergency help abroad ifthe country becomes independent			0
@entity175 , the top official at the @entity176 , said the scale of the @entity9 's embassy network would dwarf the set - up for a separate @entity7			0
at present , @entity9 consular staff around the world deal with hundreds of thousands of inquiries from members of thepublic every year			0
the cost of maintaining the global consular operation is largely met from a small charge added to the cost ofevery new @entity9 passport			0
but if there is a @entity192 vote , a @entity7 passport will be created			1
should @entity7 become an @entity170 member , @entity167 rules mean citizens would be entitled to assistance from any member state in a country where @entity7 was unrepresented			0
however , the level of aid offered by @entity170 countries varies and citizens of the country in question receive priority treatment			0
mr @entity175 , permanent under - secretary at the @entity176 , said there could also be costs attached			0
he added : ' we have 216 consular posts in 144 countries			0
they offer assistance to all @entity9 citizens			0
last year , we helped 400,000 people			0
' the @entity102 is planning a network of 70 - 90 diplomatic posts , plus a network of honorary consuls			0
where a country has any form of representation , including an honorary consul , it must look after its own citizens			0
' ' the alternative - the fishing fleets of 12 countries being denied any access to @entity7 waters and as a consequence , their access to @entity231 waters ... is clearly absurd , ' mr @entity16 said at the time			1
on behalf of the country 's fishermen , mr @entity136 wrote to the first minister : ' that would be contrary to the principle of innocent passage laid down in the law of the sea - will you explain what you meant by this ? ' mr @entity16 's response , which came to light yesterday , states : ' i thought such a ridiculous interpretation would be confined to [ @entity7 's only @entity247 mp ] @entity246 ... i find it astonishing that anyone else would follow this interpretation			1
' mr @entity136 told the @entity7 @entity251 yesterday the response was ' unacceptably dismissive ' and he added : ' this looks to me to be an attempt to intimidate			0
' he also told the @entity254 : ' rough treatment does n't bother me in the slightest but it just did n't answer the questions			0
' it therefore seemed like something of a warning or something of an attempt at intimidation about asking questions , pursufeatured ing the questions that we asked or asking any further ones			0
' but a spokesman for mr @entity16 said : ' mr @entity136 wrote to the first minister , who responded with a detailed , factual letter on @entity170 fishing rights			1
' that letter has been in the public domain for weeks - nothing in it could remotely be described as intimidating and we urge people to read it for themselves to see that			0
' the row comes amid ongoing claims of intimidation , which heavily in the @entity281 programme			2
@entity282 , former chief executive of the @entity106 , said he or senior members of his staff met @entity107 on at least six occasions over the past two years			0
' he was , i think , trying to neuter business comment , ' mr @entity282 told the programme			2
' there was a genuine fear that if we were seen to scupper by coming out publicly against independence , there would be retribution down the track			2
' but mr @entity107 said last night : ' i totally refute the allegations , especially given that both @entity282 and his successor [ @entity110 ] @entity299 have both said to me they do n't take a position on constitutional issues			2
' mr @entity282 publicly endorsed the case for a no vote last month , which he is perfectly entitled to do			2
what is a matter for me , and what i am very clear about , is that there is nothing in my conduct which answers to mr @entity282 's description			0
