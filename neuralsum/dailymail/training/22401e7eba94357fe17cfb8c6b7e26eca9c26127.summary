a relative of a first world war hero was hit with a parking fine after she stopped her car to observe an @entity5 silence			1
@entity6 - whose great uncle captain @entity7 died saving his men during the 1915 @entity9 campaign - pulled over safely at 11am on tuesday to take part in the two minute silence being respected around the country			1
but the long - held tradition was less of a priority for a local parking warden , who quickly appeared on the scene and handed ms @entity6 a fine			1
a motorist stopped her car near @entity19 on tuesday to observe a two minutes ' silence , but was left shocked when she was handed a parking ticket by a passing council warden ms @entity6 , 69 , was driving along @entity19 , west @entity24 when she heard on the radio that it would soon be 11am			1
after finding a place to stop - which was on double yellow lines - she got out of her car to remember her great uncle and those like him to lost their lives in war			1
but her silence was interrupted by a parking warden , whose behaviour she has branded ' daft and unreasonable '			1
she told @entity36 : ' i told him i was only observing the silence for @entity5 for those fallen in war , but he just looked completely blank			2
' i told him he should have some respect , but he did n't respond and said instead that he was going to give me a ticket			2
' the incident happened while members of the public around the country stopped to remember the war dead			1

the council involved in the parking row has said it will consider refunding the parking ticket , but the motorist says she does not want to take the matter further @entity57 officials have urged ms @entity6 to get in touch , suggesting they may rescind the fine on appeal			1
but , speaking to @entity61 this morning , ms @entity6 said she would not be taking the matter further			2
she said : ' @entity5 is about peace and reconciliation and , in the spirit of that , i will not be making any further complaint			0
' ms @entity6 's great uncle , who was from @entity70 , was on the @entity71 in 1915 when it sank in @entity73 while on operations			1
