an unusual planet , six times the size of earth , that is located 40 light - years outside our solar system , has been found to have a ' water - rich ' atmosphere that has a strange ' plasma form ' of water , scientists have said			1
@entity10 astronomers examined the atmosphere of the alien planet using specialist cameras with a blue filter to observe planetary transits of @entity17 b. the research team said that while its atmosphere is water - rich , the planet is not habitable like our @entity21 , as it has atmospheric temperatures that reach 280 degrees @entity24			1
an unusual planet , six times the six of earth , that is located just 40 light - years outside our solar system , has been found to have a ' water - rich ' atmosphere that has a ' plasma form ' of water , astronomers have said			1
here is an artist 's rendition of a transit of gj 1214 b in blue light			2
the blue sphere represents the host star @entity40 and the black ball in front of it is @entity40 b while the planet 's atmosphere contains water , it is still dramatically different to the @entity21 's the scientists from the @entity50 in @entity10 had set out to determine whether the planet has an atmosphere of water or hydrogen and used @entity56 's two optical cameras with a blue transmission filter to study the scattering of light from the planet			1
they then combined their findings with previous observations in other colours to conclude the atmosphere contains ' significant ' amounts of water			0
principle investigator @entity66 , told @entity67 : ' as the temperature and pressure are so high , water is not in a usual form ( vapor , liquid , or solid ) , but in an ionic or plasma form at the bottom the atmosphere - namely the interior - of @entity40 b. ' the alien planet , which is located some 40 light - years away from our solar system in the constellation @entity80 , orbits a cooler star than our sun. artist 's rendition of the relationship between the composition of the atmosphere and transmitted colours of light of an alien planet			1
top : if the sky has a clear , upward - extended , hydrogen - dominated atmosphere , @entity92 scattering disperses a large portion of the blue light from the atmosphere of the host while it scatters less of the red light			2
as a result , a transit in blue light becomes deeper than the one in red light			0
middle : if the sky has a less extended water - rich atmosphere , the effect of the @entity92 scattering is much weaker than in a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere			0
bottom : if the sky has extensive clouds , most of the light can not be transmitted through the atmosphere but it is around 70 times closer than the @entity21 to its sun and makes its journey around the low - mass star once every 38 hours			1
as is is so close , temperatures on the huge planet can reach a staggering 280 ° @entity122 , but it is the planet 's density that is surprising			0
while @entity17 b is six times as large as earth , it is less than three times in width to be as big as a planet in between the size of @entity21 and @entity131			2
dr @entity66 said : ' at high pressure and high temperature , the behaviour of water is quite different from that on the @entity21			0
' while astronomers believe water is an essential ingredient for @entity21 - like life on a planet , and @entity17 b has plenty of water , dr @entity66 does not not think it is habitable because of its close orbit			1
' although water vapour can exist in the atmosphere , liquid water - namely oceans - would not exist on the surface of this planet			2
so unfortunately , we do not think this planet would be habitable			0
' as the planet does not have a solid surface , it is difficult to estimate the height of the atmosphere , but the scientists think it could be around 30km - around three times deeper than our @entity21 's			1
they also believe plasma water could be hidden inside the planet but are unsure if they will ever be able to find the high pressure ices inside the super-earth that they suspect are there			0
the unusual planet was originally discovered as part of the @entity169 , which tracks over 2,000 low - mass stars .			0
