@entity0 plans to strip @entity2 judges of their power to enforce human rights in @entity5 have been point - blank rejected by @entity7 today			1
justice secretary @entity8 said a future @entity0 government would pull @entity5 out of the @entity10 if it did not accept that @entity11 had the final say on @entity5 law			1
but the @entity14 – the continent 's top human rights body – said the proposals were ' not consistent ' with the @entity10			1
it added that it was ' inconceivable that the @entity5 as a human rights leader and founding country of this organisation would leave			1
' the remarks leaves @entity5 membership of the @entity7 court hanging by a thread			1
justice secretary @entity8 said @entity5 should not be bound by @entity2 court rulings it comes amid a growing row over mr @entity8 's radical proposals , announced today following this week 's @entity0 conference in @entity31			1
former attorney general @entity32 , who was removed at the last reshuffle , said the proposals were ' almost puerile '			0
he added : ' i also think they are unworkable and will damage the @entity5 's international reputation			2
' mr @entity32 said the plan contained a series of factual ' howlers ' and were not properly thought through			0
mr @entity8 also came under fire from his own @entity42 colleague @entity42 , the justice minister , who accused him of playing politics with the issue because of the rise of @entity46			0
mr @entity42 said : ' the conservatives do n't care about the rights of @entity5 citizens , they care about losing to @entity46			2
these plans make no sense – you ca n't protect the human rights of @entity55 and pull out of the system that protects them			1
' under mr @entity8 's blueprint , a future @entity0 government would issue an ultimatum to @entity7 that it must accept being merely an ' advisory body ' to @entity5 courts - or face the @entity5 withdrawing from the system altogether			1
the party would scrap the @entity64 introduced by @entity65 in 1998 to enshrine the @entity66 in domestic law			0
instead there would be a @entity5 @entity69 , which would include the principles from the convention , which was originally drawn up by @entity5 lawyers after the @entity73			2
that legislation would make clear that the judges of the @entity76 were not obliged to take @entity10 ' rulings into account when coming to decisions			2
mr @entity8 said that if the @entity10 and the @entity14 refused to accept the new arrangements , @entity5 would simply leave the convention			1
he said critics of his plan were ‘ just plain wrong ’ , adding : ‘ what we ’re doing is going back to a convention that we ’re part of , to our partners in that convention and saying “ look , this does n’t work for us anymore ”			0
’ the justice secretary added : ‘ i think the public of this country are frustrated with the way human rights laws have evolved			1
’ he said the @entity7 court had a ‘ blank cheque to go where it wants with human rights laws ’ , adding : ‘ our parliament can do nothing about it			1
’ mr @entity8 said the government was ‘ absolutely prepared ’ to pull @entity5 out of the court - adding that he had consulted on his plans with the current attorney - general , @entity105 , who had considered them ' fine , viable and legal '			1
the @entity10 based in @entity7 enforces the convention on human rights set up after the @entity73 and signed by a almost all @entity2 countries			1
it is separate to the @entity110 but the @entity42 business secretary @entity42 , speaking on a visit to @entity112 , said : ‘ it 's a very retrograde step			0
‘ we do value human rights in our society - it 's what our democracy is all about - and we also value a system of law in which judges rather than politicians make the final decisions , and it 's very important that we retain that core and that framework			1
‘ we would see a gradual decline in the credibility of our legal system because , essentially , in order to score cheap populist points , the legal system is being undermined and judges are being undermined			0
’ shadow attorney general @entity133 accepted that the @entity10 was not perfect but insisted @entity5 could not ‘ pick and choose ’ the laws it wanted to abide by			2
she told @entity135 's @entity136 : ‘ in the end , if we sign up to the convention , we sign up to the convention			0
‘ if we want to amend the convention in the way the @entity141 want to then i 'm quite sure that @entity143 and @entity144 and @entity145 would be very happy to do so			0
‘ but i think the rest of civilised @entity2 would be outraged and simply would n't allow us to ... which i think would then mean that we would need to withdraw			2
’ she accused the conservatives of going ‘ far too far ’ and suggested it was a ‘ backdoor way ’ of trying to leave @entity2			0
former attorney general @entity32 said leaving the @entity10 would damage @entity5 's international reputation instead she called for judges to be improved and for the reduction of the backlog of cases at the @entity10			2
but justice minister lord @entity156 , who is responsible for human rights in the justice department , defended the plans , saying they would bring human rights back to @entity5			1
he added : ‘ we are reasserting the sovereignty of @entity11			0
‘ we are not giving any comfort to dictators			0
we have a very proud history of protecting human rights in this country			2
‘ i have rather more faith in @entity11 and our @entity76 than some people seem to do			0
‘ the very rights that are contained in the convention are going to be replicated in our @entity5 bill			2
‘ we would like to remain a party to the convention but we want ultimately to have the right to override the decision in those rare circumstances where we think the @entity7 court gets it wrong			1
’ he insisted that the @entity141 were not playing electoral politics , saying that discontent had existed for a long time			0
the barrister also said he had personally seen the problems the @entity64 causes ‘ every day ’ in the domestic courts			0
he went on : ‘ it 's an irony that the @entity65 said , when bringing in the @entity64 , that they were bringing rights home			0
in fact what they were doing was sub-contracting them to @entity7			0
