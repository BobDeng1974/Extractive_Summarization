@entity0 was put into isolation for a day after he refused to wear a clip on tie a schoolboy has been punished for refusing to wear a clip - on tie because he wants to wear a smarter traditional one - which breaches ' health and safety rules '			1
@entity0 , 13 , was put into isolation for a day , for wearing the proper tie at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			2
the 1,438 - pupil school insists pupils wear clip - on ties for health and safety reasons - but @entity0 says the clip - on ones are uncomfortable and childish			1
he prefers to wear a traditional tie of exactly the same design , given to him by a neighbour			2
he was given work to complete on his own in a small cubicle for continuing to wear the tie			0
@entity0 , of @entity26 , @entity10 , said : ' it seems bizarre and unnecessary especially over something like the tie i was wearing			2
' i like wearing a real tie because it feels proper			0
' people have worn them for generations , and if you are not wearing one during secondary school then you are never going to learn the necessary skills for when you go into the world of work			2
' when you are wearing a clip - on tie it is hard to be taken seriously , especially when you go to competitions against other schools - it feels foolish , and childish			0
' on their website in 2009 , the @entity46 said it was a ' myth ' that health and safety bans traditional school ties			1
the school has agreed to review the policy			0
@entity0 says the clip - on ones are uncomfortable and childish			1
he prefers to wear a traditional tie of exactly the same design @entity58 , headteacher , said the rule was introduced about three years ago to support the health and safety of young people he said : ' this was in line with the practice in most secondary schools nationally			1
' the policy can only be changed by governors and a parent has requested the governors review this policy , which the school has agreed to do			0
' @entity0 said he welcomed the review and hoped the governors would take his points on board			0
@entity77 , occupational safety adviser for the @entity78 , said schools can make pupils wear clip - on ties , but should not cite health and safety grounds			1
it might be a sensible precaution if a school insists on pupils wearing ties while handling rotating machinery , such as in a school workshop , but for any other reason you can not say this policy was required under health and safety law			1
' the school said the rule was introduced about three years ago to support the health and safety of young people the @entity46 's website says : ' quite rightly , few parents would see wearing school ties as a safety issue			1
' after all , millions of kids have been wearing ties for years without any real problems			0
' taking simple precautions during laboratory work or around machinery makes sense			0
but if the concern is about kids fighting , although clip - on ties may help , the real issue is discipline			0
' so no , we do n't ban school ties â€“ it 's down to the school to make decisions about uniform , not @entity46			1
' a spokesman for the @entity46 added : ' it seems to us to be a disproportionate response			0
' @entity125 , of the @entity126 , said that producers had reported a ' strong trend ' in school opting for clip on ties , largely because every tie looks uniform and neat , but also because it means that the ties do not get wrapped around students ' necks			1
she said : ' lots of school do have clip on ties , it 's a strong trend			2
it 's not definitively about health and safety			0
' obviously they can come off quite easily and do n't get stuck round children 's necks , but clip - ons do mean that all the students ' ties look the same and look smart			2
