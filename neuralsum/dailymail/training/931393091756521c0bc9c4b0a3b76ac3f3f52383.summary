@entity0 has warned his @entity2 players to prepare for a frantic @entity4 - style cup tie against the @entity5 next month			1
the @entity6 are unbeaten in @entity7 , a last - minute equaliser against struggling group favourites @entity10 removing some of the gloss from @entity2 ’s 2 - 2 draw in @entity13			1
in a game mined with sub plots , @entity0 will go head to head with his @entity18 predecessor @entity17 at @entity19 on november 14			1
the presence of former hoops stars @entity22 and @entity23 in @entity6 shirts will add further spice to a game @entity0 anticipates being explosive			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 relishing @entity28 clash against the @entity5 ‘ it ’ll be a @entity4 cup tie type thing , ’ predicted the @entity2 boss			1
‘ neither of us will be too interested in who wins the possession , put it that way			0
‘ there will be analysts telling us at half - time how many passes each team had			0
they ’ll be like : “ you ’ve had 452 passes , you ’re going great , ” so the lads can keep passing			0
‘ but , no , @entity17 and i will feel the same about it			2
if players feel fatigued then have a day off			0
’ asked if he relished the prospect of ‘ locking horns ’ with @entity17 , an iconic @entity18 manager before his own successful @entity19 tenure , @entity0 insisted : ‘ we ’ll not be locking horns , it ’s the players who ’re playing			1
@entity17 , like me , does n’t over-think football			2
former @entity18 bosses @entity0 and @entity17 ( above ) will lock horns at @entity19 next month ‘ we generally leave it to the players			1
we give them an idea of how to play and then let them get on with it			0
’ @entity17 ’s assistant @entity58 will also be in the technical area after turning down the @entity18 manager ’s job prior to @entity63 ’s appointment			1
in his recently published autobiography , the @entity6 icon claimed he joined the @entity67 champions for a short spell as a player to ‘ spite ’ then manager @entity0 after sensing he was indifferent to his arrival			1
@entity22 also expressed irritation that @entity0 allowed him to quit @entity18 with a hip problem without offering up a fight for him to stay			1
the @entity2 boss has shared a television studio with @entity22 since the @entity19 episode and dismissed talk of added spice , insisting : ‘ not at all			1
it ’s not even a second thought			0
former @entity18 midfielder @entity58 will be in the @entity6 dugout for emotional encounter ‘ we have spoken about bits and bobs from our time at @entity18 in the last three years with @entity88			1
we just laugh at things			0
‘ you need to take into account how he wrote the book			0
he was sitting smiling when he told that story			0
‘ he laughs and so do the people round about him			0
there you go , it ’s funny			0
he spoke to me about this before and i said : “ i did n’t even know your hip was that bad			0
” ’ @entity102 ’s equaliser against the world champions from @entity104 provided another twist in a @entity28 qualifying group @entity0 now regards as the hardest of them all			2
‘ if you look at the games so far you can say : “ where did that result come from ? ” that ’s just the way it ’s going to be			0
@entity5 are unbeaten in @entity113 after @entity115 's last - gasp equaliser in @entity10 ‘ like i said the other day , you never know where the big one is going to be			1
@entity119 are in good fettle , good form , but we ’re the same			0
‘ @entity13 beat @entity10 and people talk about them being fantastic but we ’re happy with how we ’re playing and we showed it did n’t matter to us how they did on saturday			2
we were next on and we felt good about it			0
’ anticipating his own return to @entity19 , @entity6 boss @entity17 said : ‘ i will take a wee bit of time to think about it			1
@entity2 are on a good run at the moment , they really are , they ’re playing with plenty of confidence			2
‘ @entity0 ( @entity0 ) has them playing well and he ’s been involved with them for a couple of seasons			2
i do n’t know what their reaction to us getting a late goal against @entity10 is but it keeps our momentum going			2

@entity2 face the @entity5 at @entity19 next month
@entity0 up against @entity18 predecessor @entity17
the @entity6 remain unbeaten after *dramatic* draw in @entity10
