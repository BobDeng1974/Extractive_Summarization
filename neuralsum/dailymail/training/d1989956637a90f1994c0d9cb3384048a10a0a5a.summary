@entity9 , from @entity10 , was happily married with three children when she was 36 - years - old			1
but her happiness was ruined when dr @entity13 recommended she get a hysterectomy when all she needed was minor bladder surgery			1

speaking to @entity24 about the 1984 procedure , she said : ' i thought i would die			0
the pain was unlike anything i had ever experienced in places i could n't understand			0
trauma : @entity31 did not just get a hysterectomy , but a nine - hour operation in which her genitalia was totally mutilated - with her vagina relocated and her clitoral hood remove ' when i went to dr @entity13 and asked , " what have you done ? " he said , " what are you talking about ? " i found out from other doctors that i had been mutilated			1
' one doctor said her genitals looked like ' a fileted fish '			0
ordinary activities were impossible like sitting down and wearing pants			0
having sex with her husband was excruciatingly painful and because of it , her 12 - year marriage fell apart			1
dr @entity13 was a respected @entity51 at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity10 , and an advocate of redesigning women 's genitalia to improve their sex life			1
he even wrote a book about it in 1975 called @entity62 , the proponent of which was : ' women are structurally inadequate for intercourse			2
this is a pathological condition amenable to surgery			0
' he performed countless operations on women , leaving most of them horribly disfigured , for almost 20 years until he surrendered his medical license in 1989 following a barrage of complaints and lawsuits			1
in 1988 , the @entity74 cited @entity13 for alleged ' experimental and medical unnecessary surgical procedures , in some incidents without proper patient consent ' , as many women believed they were going through routine procedures like post-pregnancy repairs and hysterectomies			1
@entity52 began requiring @entity13 to use a ' a special consent form specific to love surgery ' in 1979 , according to @entity84			2
he himself admitted he did not always get proper consent for some of his earliest surgeries			0
dr @entity13 is now 91 - years - old and bankrupt			1
he declined to comment on the article			0
the surgeon she trusted : dr @entity13 was an eccentric but respected ob / gyn at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity10 , and was a proponent of procedures to redesign women 's genitalia his son @entity13 , 68 , of @entity96 , defended his father 's medical practices to @entity24 : ' there are hundreds and hundreds of dr @entity13 's patients , alive today , whose marriages and lives were dramatically improved by his wholesome restoration to their fully functioning sexual responsiveness , which most of those patients had previously enjoyed earlier in their marriages			1
' until there are those in the media or the medical profession who are willing to look at the successful results , which fully benefited the lives of countless numbers of his patients , there should and will be no further comment on behalf of dr @entity13 or his family			1
' @entity120 eventually settled out of court with @entity52			1
she was one of the first to file a malpractice lawsuit against them and @entity13 in 1985			2
she is now writing a book about her experience			2
when the now - 65 - year - old first went to @entity13 , @entity120 was already in a happy second marriage with three children			1
he told her , ' you do n't really need to have more kids '			0
' i went ahead and got a hysterectomy , ' @entity120 said			1
' you trust your doctor '			0
after weeks of constant pain , she went to see another doctor for a second opinion			0
she explains : i asked for the best doctor , because i had to find out what was wrong with me			0
he looked at me and called in one of the nurses and said , " have you ever seen anything like this ? " ' he had repositioned my vagina and circumcised me			0
the doctor said he had never seen it anywhere except in @entity151 tribes			0
' the way i was deformed , i could n't have sex			0
i ended up going through three different corrective surgeries but by that time , my marriage was shot and i lost the best thing that had happened in my life			2
' when she went public with her story a number of other women came forward with similar stories			2
several other women filed malpractice lawsuits against @entity13 , but according to the @entity167 , many of the cases were dropped because doctors would not testify			1
@entity120 has moved back to @entity10 to care for her elderly parents who both have @entity171 's			2
though she says she still lives with the effects of what happened : ' my life has taken a lot of different turns and ups and downs			0
so much of it happened because of that part of my life			0
