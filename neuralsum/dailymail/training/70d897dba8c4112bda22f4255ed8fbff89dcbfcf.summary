the friend added : ‘ at a time when known drug - dealers , murderers and other real criminals escape prosecution because of a lack of certainty of conviction , it has to be asked why this sorry affair ever took place			0
' did the @entity185 team really believe they could and should make a prosecution stick concerning an alleged incident from nearly half a century ago to which there were no witnesses ? ’ @entity146 , of the @entity32 , said the woman voluntarily withdrew her statement : ‘ she said that as she would be the only complainant to give evidence if the matter went to trial , she did not want to pursue it			1
