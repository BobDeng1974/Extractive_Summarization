overstretched gps have been given the green light to strike thousands of patients from their lists			1
so far , 25 surgeries across @entity5 have been granted approval by @entity8 bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they can not cope			1
some practices have already removed as many as 1,500 patients from their lists , including elderly widows , amputees , young mothers and – in one case – all the residents of a care home			1
so far , 25 surgeries across @entity5 have been granted approval by @entity8 bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they can not cope ( file photo ) a further ten surgeries have applied this year to cut their registers and are awaiting approval			1
@entity0 say they are in the grip of a recruitment crisis and can not provide safe care for the rising numbers of people moving to their areas			1
some of the worst - affected surgeries are where the population is soaring due to migrants and elderly couples who need many appointments			1
on top of this , many gps are retiring , moving overseas or quitting altogether and there is a shortage of new doctors entering the profession			0
figures from @entity5 – obtained by @entity41 – show that 15 practices were granted approval to shrink their catchment areas in 2013/14 and another ten so far this year since april			1
officials would not identify individual surgeries but they are in areas including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
dr @entity54 is the chairman of the @entity55 , which represents @entity0 dr @entity56 , the chairman of the @entity57 , said : ‘ this is an extremely distressing situation for patients and for @entity0			2
every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to , and gps want to provide the best possible access and care for all their patients			1
‘ no surgery wants to de-register patients			2
this is still extremely rare and only takes place as a very last resort			0
unfortunately , what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of @entity0 , with many practices finding it difficult to replace doctors who are retiring			2
’ so far this year , 15 requests had been rejected and six withdrawn			0
patients who are struck off usually receive an apologetic letter from the surgery telling them they will have to register elsewhere			2
but there is no guarantee they will easily find another gp to take them on , especially in rural areas			0
some of those removed by a practice in @entity88 , in @entity89 , now have to make 16 - mile round trips to the next town to see a doctor			0
dr @entity54 , chairman of the @entity55 , which represents @entity0 , said : ‘ this is people just basically saying , “ we are not coping			0
” they are completely overstretched and struggling to find the medical staff to look after the patients			0
’ @entity98 , the chief executive of the @entity99 , said : ‘ the shrinking of gp lists is unacceptable			0
we must protect gp services and achieve real choice for patients			0
‘ patients have no control over when they are going to be sick and therefore they must have access to a gp			0

some practices have removed as many as 1,500 patients from their lists
those include widows , amputees , young mothers and all care home residents
@entity8 wo *n't* say which surgeries are to be allowed to reduce patient numbers
they include @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity124 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53
