by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 19:28 est , 23 march 2013 a map of many colors shows who @entity3 is rooting for , by region , in the @entity7 men 's basketball tournament			1
@entity8 has mapped out the national sentiment for the 68 teams competing for the championship , based on more than one million @entity8 users who liked one of the participating college basketball teams on the social media website			1
the colorful map shows the allegiances in 3,140 counties in the @entity3 and the data was split various ways to show team spirit nationally , by the four divisions and by state rivalries			1
madness : @entity8 mapped out @entity7 team loyalties by @entity26 on the social media website			0
over 1 million @entity3 @entity8 users have liked a page for one of the 68 teams in the tournament			1
poor @entity33 , no school in the lone star state made it this year leaving @entity36 unsure of who to root for most teams posted a strong showing in their home state			0
@entity42 , located in @entity43 , @entity44 , is the crowd favorite in the @entity46			2
in the @entity49 there is absolute loyalty for the teams in @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , it is the home of the @entity55 after all			1
even president @entity56 , whose roots are in @entity53 , picked @entity54 as the champion for 2013 in his @entity7 bracket			1
sadly , the lone star state seemed confused on who to root for			0
with no @entity33 teams in the tournament , the state was a smorgasbord of @entity26 for random teams , with residents unable to throw their support behind any home team			2
undoubtedly , if the @entity71 had progressed into the tournament - the state would be a solid maroon			0
some users cried foul , though , for the map 's portrayal of the strong support for the @entity77 in @entity78 , with only a tiny show of support in @entity78 for @entity82 's @entity81			2
there were only three small specks of dark blue representing fans of the @entity87			0
1 seeds : of the the four # 1 seeds , @entity54 and @entity89 seem to pull the most supporters while @entity42 and @entity93 fans are pretty much clustered in their regions in the separately created maps for the four divisions competing for the @entity7 title , @entity81 was redeemed			1
among the 18 teams playing the @entity99 , much of the country is rooting for the private school in @entity102			1
in the map portraying favorites in the @entity105 , of 16 teams , @entity81 's rival @entity77 stole the show			1
much of the @entity108 is rooting for the @entity109 and @entity52 also showed strong support for the @entity111			0
the @entity115 lived up to its name , the map for the 17 states in this division shows no clear frontrunner though @entity42 certainly charmed a large percentage of @entity8 fans			2
@entity120 are loving the @entity55 , with the exception of @entity122 , who showed unquestioning loyalty to @entity125			0
@entity49 : of the 18 teams competing in this division , @entity81 is the favorite by far though @entity129 favors @entity131 and @entity132 roots for the home team @entity134 : there is clearly a deep love for the @entity77 in this division , though fans of @entity52 , @entity89 and @entity139 proudly support their teams			1
@entity141 and @entity142 deserve sympathy though , not even one like ! west : the @entity46 goes hard for @entity42 while most of the other 17 teams in the division are feeling the love in their home states east : the @entity55 have widespread appeal among the 17 teams in the @entity146 but fans of @entity125 and @entity53 are n't afraid to show their true support the data was also spliced to show national likes by rivalries			1
down south in @entity78 , the @entity77 competition is among the fiercest but again @entity77 has won the hearts and minds of the nation			0
similarly there was a clear favorite in the @entity162 and @entity164 rivalry , with the @entity165 @entity109 coming out as the clear favorite			0
@entity167 kicked off on thursday and @entity3 are intensely watching the college basketball teams face off to monitor how they will fare in their @entity169			2
millions of @entity3 will fill out a bracket to predict the outcome of the games , though a scientist at @entity174 has calculated that a person 's chances of perfectly predicting the correct outcome to all 68 games is 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 ( 9 quintillion )			2
though the odds are really not in a person 's favor , that does n't stop people from putting money where their mouth is			0
estimates suggest as much as $ 3 billion could change hands in office betting pools			0
these colors do n't bleed : there must be something in the water in @entity78			0
between @entity81 ( dark blue ) and @entity78 ( light blue ) , @entity77 is the national favorite we 're not in @entity89 anymore : no question , the @entity162 ( blue ) are the national favorite among this rivalry			1
sorry @entity201 , do n't mean to kick a man when he 's down ( @entity203 lost to @entity204 on friday and had to kiss their dream of advancing in the tournament goodbye ) @entity207 : @entity208 ( yellow ) pretty much dominated @entity210 ( green ) in terms of support			0

@entity214 shows fan support in 3,140 counties in the @entity3
results *compiled* from one million @entity219 who liked a page for one of the 68 teams in the @entity7 tournament
