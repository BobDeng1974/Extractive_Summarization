five people who had suffered severe strokes regained the power of speech and mobility thanks to a radical new treatment stroke patients have shown remarkable signs of recovery after they were given a radical new treatment			1
five people who had suffered severe strokes regained the power of speech , use of their arms and legs and improved cognition after just six months , according to @entity16 research published today			1
the three men and two women , aged between 45 and 75 , were treated with stem cells extracted from their own bone marrow in the first experiment of its kind			1
the treatment , developed by scientists at @entity26 in @entity27 , is thought to be so effective because it triggers the rapid regeneration of brain cells that are damaged during a stroke			1
more than 150,000 people have a stroke in @entity34 every year , with patients suffering paralysis , speech problems and personality changes			1
many never recover their independence			0
scientists cautioned that the new treatment is at a very early stage , and said it needs to be tested on thousands more people before it can be declared a complete success , but they said the results show great potential to revolutionise life for stroke patients			1
dr @entity51 , who led the research , said : ‘ obviously this is just a pilot study with five patients , but it is very exciting and certainly a spring board for more research to take this further			0
‘ this is the first step in translating the basic science to the bedside for our patients			0
‘ there were significant improvements in all our patients in neurological and clinical terms			0
’ each of the five test patients had suffered severe ischemic strokes , in which an artery feeding blood to the brain had become blocked			2
when this happens the brain cells are starved of oxygen and can die , causing severe motor impairments including drooping faces , paralysed legs and arms , and problems with eating and talking			1
out of the five patients , four had suffered the very worst category of stroke - a total anterior circulation stroke , in which the entire blood supply to the front of one side of the brain is cut off			2
the prognosis for people who have this kind of stroke is usually poor - around 50 per cent die within six months , and another 46 per cent are left dependent on others			2
only 4 per cent recover enough to live independently			0
the treatment , developed by scientists at @entity26 in @entity27 , is thought to be so effective because it triggers the rapid regeneration of brain cells that are damaged during a stroke ( illustrated )			1
more than 150,000 people have a stroke in @entity34 every year , suffering paralysis and speech problems three men and two women , aged between 45 and 75 , were treated with stem cells extracted from their own bone marrow			1
they had all suffered severe ischemic strokes , in which an artery feeding blood to the brain had become blocked			0
the therapy uses stem cells called @entity118 + - a set of stem cells in the bone marrow that encourages the regeneration of blood cells and blood vessels			1
a bone marrow sample was taken from the hip seven days after a stroke and the stem cells were isolated			1
the cells were then injected , via an artery in their groin , directly into the brain			2
the treatment triggers the rapid regeneration of brain cells damaged in a stroke			1
in the trial , three out of four patients regained enough control over their bodies to live independently within six months			1
they were able to wash , dress , eat , drink , look after their bodily functions , as well as walking			0
the treatment is at an early stage and needs years of testing before it could be offered as a standard treatment for stroke victims			1
in the trial , however , three out of four - 75 per cent - had regained enough control over their bodies to live independently within six months			0
dr @entity51 said : ‘ they were able to walk and able to look after themselves			0
‘ they were able to wash , dress , eat , drink , look after their bodily functions , as well as walking			0
’ the remarkable results , however described in the journal @entity166 , come with many caveats			0
the experiment was only set up to establish that the treatment was safe - which it did - but five patients are not enough to show that it is truly effective			0
the therapy uses stem cells called @entity118 + - a set of stem cells in the bone marrow that encourages the regeneration of blood cells and blood vessels			1
previous research has shown that treatment using these cells can significantly improve recovery from stroke in animals			2
rather than developing into brain cells themselves , the cells are thought to release chemicals that trigger the growth of new brain tissue and new blood vessels in the area damaged by stroke			1
the patients were treated within seven days of a severe stroke , in contrast to several other stem cell trials , most of which have treated patients after six months or later			2
after permission was obtained from the patient or their family , a bone marrow sample was taken from their hip and the stem cells were isolated			1
the cells were then injected , via an artery in their groin , directly into the brain			0
at least seven more years of testing are needed before it could reach hospitals , and thousands of patients will have to undergo the treatment before it is deemed a success			2
but scientists are excited about its @entity222 who also worked on the research , said : ‘ these are early but exciting data worth pursuing			0
the therapy uses stem cells called @entity118 + - a set of stem cells in the bone marrow ( pictured ) that encourages the regeneration of blood cells and blood vessels scientific evidence from our lab further supports the clinical findings and our aim is to develop a drug , based on the factors secreted by stem cells that could be stored in the hospital pharmacy so that it is administered to the patient immediately following the diagnosis of stroke in the emergency room			1
‘ this may diminish the minimum time to therapy and therefore optimise outcome			0
now the hard work starts to raise funds for this exciting research			0
’ dr @entity255 , neuroscientist at @entity256 , said : ‘ this is one of the most exciting recent developments in stroke research ; however , it ’s still early days in stem cell research but the findings could lead to new treatments for stroke patients in the future			2
’ dr @entity266 , consultant cardiologist at the @entity267 , added : ‘ it is important to understand that this study is only the very earliest step towards a possible new treatment for stroke and does not prove the stem cell treatment improved these patients ’ recovery			2
‘ a much larger trial will be needed to compare stem cell treatment with no stem cell treatment			0
anyone who has seen the suffering a stroke can cause will be encouraged that doctors and scientists are continually exploring new ways to treat this devastating disease			0

5 stroke victims were treated with stem cells extracted from bone marrow
treatment triggers rapid regeneration of damaged brain cells
patients regained power of speech and use of their arms and legs
more than 150,000 people have a stroke in @entity34 every year
treatment is at early stage and needs years of testing
@entity26 scientists says it shows ' great potential '
