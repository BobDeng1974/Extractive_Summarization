by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has made a claim on the @entity4 in an effort to assert its sovereignty in the resource - rich @entity7			1
the country last week applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the @entity12 , including extensions into the @entity7 seafloor covering roughly 656,000 miles ( 1.7 million sq km )			1
@entity2 filed the preliminary submission last week based on rules laid out in the @entity17 , which regulates international law for the oceans			0
@entity2 has made a claim on the @entity4 in an effort to assert its sovereignty in the resource - rich @entity7 , pictured			2
the country last week applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the @entity12 , including extensions into the @entity7 seafloor covering roughly 656,000 miles ( 1.7 million sq km ) currently , under international law , @entity2 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29 - the five countries with territories near the @entity32 - are allotted 200 nautical miles from their northern coasts			1
however , under the @entity17 , exclusive claims can be vastly expanded for @entity7 nations that prove that their part of the continental shelf extends beyond that zone			1
@entity2 has applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the @entity12 , including extensions into the @entity7 seafloor covering roughly 656,000 miles ( 1.7 million sq km )			1
this is roughly the size of @entity43 and the @entity45 region combined			0
if successful , the country will have rights to the polar region 's resources , which is estimated to contain 30 per cent of the world 's undiscovered natural gas and 15 per cent of oil			1
while @entity2 's foreign affairs minister , @entity54 announced that the country ’s final claim would include the @entity4 , he added scientific evidence to back the claim is n't yet ready			0
‘ for whatever reason , the scientists and the aircraft stopped the research when they got to the @entity4 , ’ professor @entity59 , an @entity7 expert at the @entity60 told @entity61			0
‘ the science could n’t have been too hard , because they were able to get up to the @entity4			0
but no one has given me a satisfactory answer as to why they stopped			0
’ ‘ it may just have been a simple mistake , ’ he added			0
professor @entity59 said further studies will depend on the availability of researchers , ice breakers and scientific equipment , but at a push , it could be completed in a year			0
@entity2 ’s decision to continue the work puts it head - to - head with @entity28 , along with potential negotiations with @entity26 and the @entity29 , as all have expressed interest in the @entity4			0
asserting @entity2 's rights in the @entity7 has been a popular domestic issue for prime minister @entity89 , though at least one expert on the issue described the planned claim as a long shot			2
currently , under international law , @entity2 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29 - the five countries with territories near the @entity32 - are allotted 200 nautical miles from their northern coasts			2
the different regions are shown on this map this graphic shows how @entity2 wants to expand its borders in the @entity7 ‘ we are determined to ensure that all @entity2 benefit from the tremendous resources that are to be found in @entity2 's far north , ’ mr @entity54 said			2
@entity2 's submission last week set out the potential outer limits of the country 's continental shelf in the @entity12 - a claim of 656,373 miles ( roughly 1.7 million sq km )			1
@entity2 's follow - up submission will include a claim to the @entity112 , an undersea mountain range between @entity114 , @entity2 's most northern land mass , and @entity28 's east @entity117 coast			2
that claim would extend @entity2 's claim 200 nautical miles beyond the @entity4			2
the submission that @entity2 filed with the @entity17 is essentially a series of undersea co-ordinates that map what the government claims is the country 's extended continental shelf			1
mr @entity54 said it 's a mammoth task , and the government needs more time to complete the mapping in the @entity7 , and to get its @entity17 submission right			1
following the claims made by @entity2 's foreign affairs minister , @entity54 , @entity28 president @entity131 has ordered his military to increase its focus on the @entity7			1
speaking to defence minister @entity136 , @entity131 praised the military 's work in the @entity7 and said it intended to finish plans by the end of the year to upgrade military bases in the resource - rich region where world powers jostle for control			1
as well as @entity2 , the @entity29 , @entity26 and @entity27 are also pressing for control of what they consider their fair share of massive untapped oil and natural gas reserves			0
' i request that you pay special attention to the deployment of infrastructure and military units in the @entity7 , ' @entity131 said , speaking at a @entity159 board meeting			2
' by the end of the year it is planned - and i expect it will be done ... the renewal of the @entity164 airfield and completion of construction work on the @entity168 airfield , ' he said in televised comments			0
@entity28 has already completed work on renovating an airfield on the @entity172 , which was abandoned in 1993			0
earlier this year @entity173 sent 10 warships and four icebreakers to the islands in a show of force			0
underscoring @entity173 's sensitivity over @entity7 claims , @entity28 arrested 30 people on board a @entity184 ship during a september protest against @entity28 offshore @entity7 drilling			1
they now face charges carrying seven year jail sentences			0
@entity131 said earlier this week that @entity28 's military presence in the @entity7 was needed to protect against potential threats from the @entity29			1
the world 's largest oil producer , @entity28 expects to see oil output decline at its mainstay western @entity117 oilfields in coming years and has looked further afield to potential @entity7 reserves			1
@entity28 , @entity2 and @entity26 all say an underwater mountain range known as the @entity112 , which stretches 1,800 km ( 1,120 miles ) across the pole under the @entity7 , is part of their own landmass			1
‘ that 's why we have asked our officials and scientists to do additional and necessary work to ensure that a submission for the full extent of the @entity209 in the @entity7 includes @entity2 's claim to the @entity4 , ’ he said			2
the @entity17 submission is also political , said @entity212 , an expert on @entity7 and international law at the @entity214			2
‘ ( @entity89 ) does not want to be the prime minister seen publicly as having surrendered the @entity4 , even if the scientific facts do n't support a @entity2 claim , ’ professor @entity212 said			0
‘ what he 's essentially doing here is holding this place , standing up for @entity2 sovereignty , while in private he knows full well that position is untenable			0
’ if @entity2 's claim is successful , the country will have rights to the polar region 's resources , which is estimated to contain 30 per cent of the world 's undiscovered natural gas and 15 per cent of oil			1
the area is highly political and @entity28 , in particular , has recently been looking further afield to these potential @entity7 reserves the @entity17 submissions do not lead to a binding decision , but lay the groundwork for future country - to - country negotiations over competing territorial claims in the @entity7 that could take years to resolve			1
mr @entity212 said there is n't any particular rush for @entity2 to stake its claim for the @entity4 , pointing out that such claims cover some of the most remote and harshest places on the planet , and commercial exploitation of resources is a long way off			0
‘ we 're talking about the centre of a large , inhospitable ocean that is in total darkness for three months each year , thousands of miles from any port , " he said			0
‘ the water in the @entity4 is 12,000 feet ( 3,650 meters ) deep and will always be covered by sea ice in the winter			0
it 's not a place where anyone is going to be drilling for oil and gas			2
president @entity131 has also ordered @entity28 's military to increase its focus on the @entity7 and finish plans by the end of the year to upgrade military bases in the resource - rich region where world powers jostle for control			1
‘ i request that you pay special attention to the deployment of infrastructure and military units in the @entity7 , ’ @entity131 said , speaking at a @entity159 board meeting last year			0
@entity131 said earlier this week that @entity28 's military presence in the @entity7 was needed to protect against potential threats from the @entity29 .			1

the country has applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the @entity12
this includes extensions into the @entity7 seafloor covering 656,000 miles ( 1.7 million sq km )
claims were made under the @entity17
the land is said to contain 30 per cent of the world 's undiscovered gas , and 15 per cent undiscovered oil
in response , @entity28 is planning to increase its military presence in the area
