a farmer has been ordered to tear down a castle he secretly built behind haystack after losing a six year planning battle @entity5 built the impressive castle - @entity24 - on his land in @entity9 , @entity10 , in 2001 but kept it hidden under a 40ft - high stack of hay bales and tarpaulin until 2006 guidelines state that anything built without planning permission , but remaining unchallenged for four years or more , could not be ‘ enforced against ’ by planners			1
but @entity34 & @entity35 refused to grant retrospective planning permission and he was ordered to demolish the four - bed property - @entity24 - in 2007			1
for the past six years mr @entity5 and wife @entity38 has been through the appeals system as they fought to keep their home			0
they have been through hearings at the @entity44 and the @entity45 and many appeals , but were finally ordered to knock down the castle after a two - day hearing of the @entity44 , a government agency responsible for ruling on planning appeals			1
the report , written by inspector @entity51 and published last week , said mr @entity5 had kept his home ‘ concealed ’ behind a shield of straw bales ’ and that he had ‘ set out deliberately to deceive ’ the council by using the four - year rule			1
she wrote : ' his actions in constructing the dwelling house behind a wall of straw bales , and then living in the building for over four years before the bales were removed , was intended to conceal the building and its use from the council ’s knowledge and thus prevent any enforcement action being taken before it was too late			0
' councillor @entity69 , @entity34 & @entity71 ’s member for planning and development , said last week : ' we are pleased with the outcome of the appeal and the planning inspector ’s decision			0
' it supports our argument that the building is unlawful and that our earlier enforcement notices are valid			0
' had this appeal been allowed , it would have set an unacceptable precedent for development in the green belt			0
mr @entity5 was relying on guidelines which stated that anything built without planning permission , but remaining unchallenged for four years or more , could not be ' enforced against ' by planners ' the council has a duty to protect the green belt from unlawful development and the character of the borough - that is what our residents want and expect of us			1
' speaking at a previous appeal hearing at the @entity45 in 2010 deputy high court judge sir @entity99 said it was ‘ clear ’ the castle had been built in ‘ clandestine fashion ’			1
he told the court : ' mr @entity5 made it quite clear that the construction of his house was undertaken in a clandestine fashion , using a shield of straw bales around it and tarpaulins or plastic sheeting over the top in order to hide its presence during construction			0
' he stated that he knew he had to deceive the council of its existence until a period of four years from substantial completion and occupation had occurred as they would not grant planning permission for its construction			2
speaking previously , mr @entity5 said he would ‘ never demolish his home ’ and that he would go to the @entity127 if necessary , adding : ' this house will never be knocked down			2
this is a beautiful house that has been lovingly created			0
i will do whatever it takes to keep it			0
' mr @entity5 was ordered to pay the council ’s costs for the appeal			2
a spokesman for @entity34 & @entity35 said today that mr @entity5 has six weeks to appeal to the @entity45 against the latest decision - ordering him to knock down his castle			2
she said that mr @entity5 also has two new planning applications in place - one for building a new barn and another for retrospective planning permission to keep the castle for ‘ agricultural use ’			1
secret : @entity5 built the castle - complete with ramparts and a canon - on his land in @entity9 , @entity10 , in 2001 she added : ' mr @entity5 has the right to challenge the @entity44 ’s decision and has six weeks to appeal to the @entity45 if he wishes to do so			1
' ' these latest appeals are different to the applications that were the subject of his earlier @entity45 appeal - these were against our refusal of three further applications for @entity159 ( to retain the house and patio ) submitted between 2009 and 2011			0
' mr @entity5 also has two new planning applications in with the council which are awaiting determination - one for a small open sided barn structure and the other for retrospective permission to retain the house on grounds of an agricultural need case			2
' ' we can not comment any further at this stage as we can not prejudice the determination of the planning applications or our legal position			0

but an appeal to keep the castle has failed and he has finally been ordered to knock it down after a two - day hearing of the @entity44
