its remuneration committee has been discussing a series of proposals to change the way it dishes out windfalls			0
@entity1 is mulling over proposals to change the way it dishes out windfalls to staff options include ditching annual bonus payments and extending the timeframe for share payouts – called long - term incentive plans – from three to ten years			0
this would tie the awards of directors to the long - term performance of the company and help clampdown on reckless behaviour			1

’ while rivals , including @entity58 and @entity59 , faced a pay rebellion in the so - called shareholder spring , @entity1 escaped a bruising at this year ’s annual showdown with investors in may			0
