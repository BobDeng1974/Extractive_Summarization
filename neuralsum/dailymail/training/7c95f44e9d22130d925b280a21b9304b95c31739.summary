@entity1 stuffed wads of cash into the pockets of @entity6 crew members to bribe them for coveted places on the lifeboats , it has been claimed			1
@entity10 investigators are looking into eyewitness accounts that ' expensively dressed @entity12 ' paid off staff as ' the disabled were left to fend for themselves '			1
@entity16 resident @entity15 also said the first residents to reach dry land on lifeboats were not ' wounded women and children ' - instead , she saw ' healthy men and elegant women in evening gowns who were speaking @entity25 ' being the first to be saved , @entity26 reported			1
the claims came as dramatic pictures emerged showing accounts describing the disaster 's aftermath as like a scene from the @entity33 were not far wrong			2
at the prow of the ship , holidaymakers can be seen attempting to make their way to safety the bodies of three @entity54 passengers were identified this morning			2
sixteen deaths have been confirmed so far and 22 people are still missing			1
divers are keeping up the search for bodies , but officials acknowledged it would take ' a miracle ' to find any more survivors			1
salvage experts also continued work today to begin pumping tons of fuel off the ship			2
in the pictures , that emerged last night , lifeboats can be seen spilling from the sides of the boat into the gloomy waters off the island of @entity16 as the cruise liner sinks into the @entity77 at the rear on the starboard side wait to climb aboard those lifeboats which have n't already been deployed			2
and holidaymakers , who moments earlier had been enjoying dinner on the luxury vessel , make their way around the heavily - banking prow of the ship			2
escape : a boat is seen near the front of the ship being lowered into the water , containing holidaymakers who minutes earlier had been enjoying dinner dramatic : the listing ship moments after she ran aground , with the lights giving the gloomy waters an eerie glow passengers at the rear on the starboard side wait to climb aboard those lifeboats which have n't already been deployed the whole dramatic scene is lit up like a @entity107 movie by the many lights on the @entity6 , which would soon plunge into darkness as it sank into the water , claiming at least 16 lives			2
today , search efforts aboard the doomed liner continued , but an official overseeing the operation acknowledged for the first time that it would take a miracle to find any more survivors			1
@entity121 , head of @entity123 's national civil protection agency , said rescuers would keep searching the ship , which is half - submerged in the @entity126 off the island , until every reachable area is inspected			2
' finding someone alive today belongs in the realm of miracles , ' @entity121 said			1
' but since none of us , at least inside , wants to give up on that possibility , we will continue			2
' operations today saw search teams set off more explosions on the submerged third floor deck to allow easier access for divers			1
clean up : an oil recovery platform is seen next to the ship this evening , allowing ease of access for rescuers to the liner and assuring no fuel can escape checks : a firefighting team perform operations around the ship today			0
the officers were assessing anti-oil spill booms , seen in the foreground seventeen people are still unaccounted for , but the last person to be found alive was on january 15 when a senior crew member was discovered less than 36 hours after the grounding			1
a hairdresser was the last person to leave the stricken @entity6 , it has emerged			1
@entity162 , 35 , shamed the ship 's captain @entity163 by reportedly staying on board for seven hours to help hundreds of passengers to safety			1
his heroic efforts came as disgraced @entity169 , 52 , was ferried to shore just two hours after the vessel hit the rocks			1
he claims he fell into a lifeboat			0
@entity162 defied danger to organise the ferrying of survivors in rescue boats as the ship listed at a crazy angle off @entity10 isle @entity16 , investigators have been told			1
he has shrugged off praise by telling @entity183 's @entity182 newspaper : ' at some point i thought i might die but i was there to help			0
' the @entity6 ran aground after captain @entity187 veered from his approved course and gashed the ship 's hull on a reef , forcing the panicked evacuation of the 4,200 passengers and crew			1
on wednesday , the chief executive of @entity197 , @entity198 , insisted that @entity169 did n't have approval to change the ship 's routing and was going far too fast to be so close to shore			0
but he defended the practice of so - called ' tourist navigation , ' whereby enormous cruise ships steer close to shore to give passengers a look at the sites			0
he said it was part of the ' cruise product ' that passengers demand and that cruise lines are forced to offer to stay competitive			0
' it 's something that enriches the cruise product , ' @entity198 told a parliamentary committee			0
' there are many components of the cruise product , and we have to do them like everyone else because we are in a global competition			0
' @entity198 stressed that such deviations from charted routes are supposed to follow strict protocols that ensure safety : ports are informed , the company is informed , and certainly no ship of the @entity6 's size would be charging 200 - 300 yards off shore at 16 knots			0
' for anyone who knows that zone , that ship with those characteristics should n't have been there , ' he said			0
@entity169 is under house arrest , facing accusations of manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning a ship before all passengers were evacuated			0
his lawyer filed a motion challenging the house arrest , saying @entity169 was n't a flight risk and asserting that there was no risk that he would repeat the crime since no cruise line would hire him , the @entity246 news agency reported			0
operations : a coast guard team pulls up alongside the ship earlier today			0
