@entity1 's prospects of success in the @entity4 next season could be damaged after crashing out of the competition at the last - 16 stage in @entity7			1
city are borderline whether they are placed in either the second or third group of seeds for the 2015 - 16 group stages and risk a potential draw with @entity7 and @entity12 , or @entity13 and @entity14 , if they do n't improve their @entity16 coefficient and drop into pot three			1
@entity19 's men - who lost 1 - 0 in the @entity20 on wednesday and 3 - 1 overall on aggregate - are currently ranked the 16th best team in @entity16 but that could fall after they failed to make this season 's quarter - finals			1
a @entity25 - inspired @entity7 edged out @entity1 with a 1 - 0 win in the @entity20 to end their @entity28 dream @entity1 could drop down into pot three after crashing out of the @entity4 @entity30 and his @entity1 team - mates could not overturn a 2 - 1 first - leg deficit @entity33 , @entity7 , @entity13 , @entity34 , @entity14 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity12 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity1 * @entity44 are only ranked 40th so are guaranteed a tough draw if they finish in the top four			1
coefficients are based on @entity49 performances over the last five seasons which is why @entity39 are placed higher than @entity1 despite not qualifying last season			2
@entity37 's ranking also remains high because they have reached the @entity4 knockout stages every year in the time span			0
city have complained in the past of unfavourable draws in the @entity4 group stages hampering their progress			0
despite more than £ 1billion invested into the club since 2008 , the @entity60 owners have not seen their side progress beyond the first knockout stage of the competition			0
they failed to qualify from a tough group in 2011 - 12 after being paired with @entity66 , @entity13 and @entity67 and suffered the same fate the following season against @entity33 , @entity40 and @entity69			0
their co-efficient has risen since and they were able to finish second in their group this season after being placed among the second seeds and being drawn against @entity13 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
however , @entity16 have changed their seeding policy for next season and the domestic champions of @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 will automatically be top seeds alongside the winners of this year 's competition			2
@entity39 will be placed in pot two if they finish inside the top four despite last season 's poor campaign @entity34 are ranked the fourth best side in @entity16 - behind @entity33 , @entity7 and @entity13 the second pot will be made up of the next eight highest - ranked clubs – and @entity1 ca n't be certain of that			1
among the clubs just below them in the listings are @entity102 who look certain to be top seeds as @entity106 champions and @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity66 who are all still in the @entity110 and can improve their coefficient in that competition			0
there are still a lot of twists and turns in the domestic leagues before next season 's seedings are announced and of course @entity1 still have to confirm their own participation by finishing in the top four of the @entity122			2
but there is no doubt the outcome in the @entity20 , where they have to overturn a 2 - 1 first - leg deficit , could have an effect on @entity1			2
this is how next season 's @entity4 group seedings would look if the season ended during the current stage of the campaign : top seeds : @entity33 , @entity7 , @entity13 , @entity34 , @entity136 , @entity35 , @entity42 and @entity102 second pot : @entity14 ( ranked 5th ) , @entity37 ( 8th ) , @entity38 ( 9th ) , @entity39 ( 10th ) , @entity12 ( 11th ) , @entity41 ( 13th ) , @entity43 ( 15th ) and @entity1 ( 16th ) city are particularly vulnerable because they could be replaced by @entity36 in the second pot if the @entity84 side , currently fifth in the @entity139 , finished in the top four			1
@entity142 ' @entity44 are likely to face a tough @entity4 draw if they seal a top - four spot			0

@entity1 are currently ranked the 16th best team in @entity16
@entity1 could drop down to pot three after *elimination* by @entity7
@entity49 league winners will now automatically be placed in pot one
read : @entity1 have changed just two first - team *players* since 2011
