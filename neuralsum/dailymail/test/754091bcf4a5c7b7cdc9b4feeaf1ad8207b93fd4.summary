a cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm			1
@entity9 , 48 , has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at @entity11 , during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue			1
medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from mr @entity9 's arm			1
the only drawback is that it still has hairs on it , and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved			2
@entity9 , 48 , had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer , so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it the dramatic story began after mr @entity9 , a part - time welder , went to his gp in october 2013 after being unable to swallow			1
after a second doctor 's appointment , he was referred to @entity11 where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right - hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy			1
he said : ' being told i had cancer was mind - blowing and a real low point for me			2
i had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be			0
' it was a double - blow for mr @entity9 , as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer @entity52			1
he said : ' it was all so overwhelming			0
my life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing i knew i 'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation			0
' @entity9 had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on november 13 , 2013			1
he said : ' i had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure			0
mr @entity9 was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at @entity11 ( pictured ) , with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour ' they had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too , just to be safe in case the cancer had spread			1
' @entity9 spent nine days in hospital after his operation , returning now only for check - ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue			1
he said : ' usually , people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and , during this , the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size			2
' because i did n't need either , it meant i later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed			2
' my tongue 's absolutely fine			0
i had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it 's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking			0
' @entity9 continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on christmas day 2013			2
and , in another fortunate turn of events , he was offered his old job a @entity52 back in march 2014			0
he added : ' @entity52 actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work			0
mr @entity9 , who is now preparing to run the @entity110 to raise money for @entity112 , says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved ' it was the best feeling in the world when , two weeks after coming through the operation , the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and i did n't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy			1
' now @entity9 is preparing to run the @entity110 and is hoping to raise more than Â£ 3,000 for cancer research			2
he said : ' i was not fit or well at all when i was watching the @entity110 last year but i thought how much i 'd love to do it			0
' i 've never done anything like it before so , when i started feeling better , i decided to start training and now i 'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime			0
' if i can get over the finish line , whatever time i do it in , it will be absolutely brilliant			0

@entity9 , 48 , diagnosed with cancer after being left unable to swallow
had 14 - hour surgery during which doctors sawed through his jawbone
needed new tongue *created* from arm skin , which allowed him to talk
but skin still has hairs on it , meaning he now needs to shave his mouth
