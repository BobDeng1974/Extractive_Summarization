‘ but these walks usually ended badly			0
in fact , your father , inspired by nature , launched into speeches which i did not really understand			2
he did not speak @entity20 , but solely ranted in @entity41 , talking to an imaginary audience			1
‘ even if i spoke @entity41 i would not be able to follow him , as the histories of @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 were not familiar to me at all , far from it			0
my reaction used to anger your father so much that i did not show any reaction			2
