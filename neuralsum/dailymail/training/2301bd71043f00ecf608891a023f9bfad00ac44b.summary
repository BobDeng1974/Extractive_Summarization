as the @entity1 continues , @entity0 will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture in @entity4 from team news and key battles to betting odds and @entity9 stats ... here is all the information you need for the first game in @entity13 between @entity14 and @entity15 venue : @entity18 @entity17 , @entity19 - off : 11pm key clash : @entity35 v emir @entity34 the @entity36 forward scored in his first meeting with @entity34 , when the defender played for @entity39 in 2011			1
@entity34 , 33 , will not even be able to just focus on @entity14 ’s talisman , with @entity41 and @entity42 joining the four - time @entity44 winner to make up a potent front - three			0
one to watch : @entity46 ( @entity14 ) outstanding for @entity49 this season , @entity46 ’s role for his national side is equally important			1
not only is the 26 - year - old capable of gliding past defenders and chipping in with goals , he also has the discipline to track back and help his side defensively			0
this will be particularly important given @entity14 ’s potential weakness at the back			0
head - to - head record : played 2 @entity59 2 threat : @entity46 could be one of @entity14 's danger men @entity62 : @entity35 takes centre stage in the @entity1 on sunday , facing @entity15 in the @entity64 with dreams of returning to the stadium for the final in four weeks ' time			1
@entity14 arrive in @entity69 with expectations running high , not least that @entity35 will produce the kind of displays that were absent in @entity73 four years ago			2
@entity14 have a wonderfully - talented attack , so much so that coach @entity31 could afford to leave @entity75 out of his squad - but there are still question marks at the back , something readily admitted by @entity81 , coach in 2010			2
that attacking strength is however causing a dilemma for coach @entity31			0
the coach has admitted that he favours a 5 - 3 - 2 formation - but he used a 4 - 3 - 3 set - up during the successful qualifying campaign , choosing not to squander his firepower			0
however , there have been indications in training this week that he is going to be more conservative against @entity15 , which means @entity42 missing out			0
much , of course , will depend on @entity35 but @entity15 coach @entity32 's insists he has no plans to man - mark the four - times world player of the year			1
this will be @entity15 's @entity1 debut , indeed their first major tournament having only played the first match as an independent nation in 1995 following the civil war and break - up of @entity105			1
@entity14 defender @entity106 says they are acutely aware of the threat of @entity110 striker @entity109			1
tough test : @entity35 is likely to be marked by @entity15 's @entity34			2
