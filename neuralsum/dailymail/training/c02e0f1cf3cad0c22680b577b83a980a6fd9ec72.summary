@entity1 chairman @entity0 has warned the @entity2 to watch its back because the @entity4 is about to overtake it			1
the @entity4 is currently third in @entity7 's five - year rankings , but closing in on the @entity2 all the time			1
and @entity0 has called on all @entity9 sides participating in @entity7 next week to pull out all the stops to ensure @entity12 's top division drops a position at the end of the current season , which is feasible			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 believes the @entity4 will overtake the @entity2 ' i think that the @entity17 are looking over to us with rather a bit of envy , ' he told @entity22 television			1
' they may have high income , but on a sporting level , they are losing a bit of attractiveness compared to the @entity4			0
' not long ago , we were fourth in the @entity7 rankings and now we are third			2
' we 've caught up a lot on the @entity2 in recent years and i 'd like to call on all @entity4 clubs involved in the @entity33 and the @entity34 in the coming week to get as many points as possible			2
' we can overtake @entity12 this year and that would be a big slap in the face for the @entity2			0
' @entity1 ( right ) and @entity39 ( left ) contested an all - @entity41 final in 2013 @entity42 were @entity12 's best representatives in the @entity33 last season , losing in the semi-finals while setting his sights on overtaking @entity12 , @entity0 should perhaps also be wary of what is going on behind @entity48			1
@entity49 , which dropped to fourth in the rankings in 2012 , when @entity48 secured a fourth starting berth in the @entity33 at the expense of @entity53 , have accumulated more points than any other nation so far this season			0
although they are not likely to have any chance of regaining third place for a few years at least , the fact @entity58 clubs have started to take the @entity34 seriously with only one team - @entity63 - dropping any points on the first two @entity65 matchdays shows they are keen to close a gap which currently stands at over 11,000 points			0
the @entity4 is just over 3,000 points behind the @entity2 with @entity70 's @entity69 still over 14,000 points clear at the top			2
at the end of the current campaign , @entity12 will lose the 18,357 points it gained in 2010/11 , while the @entity4 loses just 15,666 points			0
@entity53 will lose 11,571 points , enabling it to make up ground by keeping up the pace it has set so far this season			0
@entity70 's @entity69 is ranked first in @entity7 's rankings 14,000 points ahead of the @entity2			1

@entity2 is ranked second as @entity7 's best league by @entity7
@entity4 is third in five - year rankings but closing in on @entity2
@entity1 chairman @entity0 believes it wo *n't* be long before the @entity4 overtakes the @entity2
