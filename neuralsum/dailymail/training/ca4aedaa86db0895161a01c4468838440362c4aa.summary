@entity0 says he wears pyjamas , @entity2 donned a nightcap and @entity4 wore just @entity5 — but what is the best thing to wear in bed ? it seems that @entity4 might have been on to something			1
one in three adults sleeps in the nude , according to an international study by the @entity15 @entity14 , and it ’s been shown to have all sorts of benefits			1
here , experts reveal how ditching pyjamas could improve your sleep quality , boost your relationship and may even help burn calories			1
it seems the movie star might have been on to something going naked means a @entity35 ’s sleep sleep experts agree it ’s important to keep cool at night as your body ( or ‘ core ’ ) temperature needs to drop by about half a degree for you to fall asleep			1
the brain , driven by your internal body clock , sends messages to the blood vessels to open up and release heat			0
‘ your core temperature is at its highest at 11pm and its lowest at 4am , ’ says dr @entity48 , director of the @entity49 and author of @entity51 : the expert guide to @entity54			0
‘ if anything prevents that decline in temperature , the brain will wake itself up to see what ’s going on , meaning you ’ll struggle to get to sleep or you ’ll have disturbed sleep			1
‘ the advantage of sleeping naked is it ’s easier for the body to cool and maintain the lower temperature the brain wants to achieve			1
’ @entity66 , professor of circadian neuroscience at the @entity67 , says ditching nightwear may improve your slumber			0
‘ if you ’re wearing lots of bedclothes it ’s going to be more difficult to regulate your temperature , so wear the least you can get away with			1
’ disrupted sleep from being too hot does n’t just mean you ’ll get less sleep overall , but it might mean less deep sleep , the most restorative type			1
deep sleep is key for memory consolidation and the production of growth hormone — important for cell repair and growth			1
why does the body cool down during sleep ? one theory is that it evolved to do this because our ancestors in @entity89 would grab some rest in the afternoon , and needed to keep cool in the savanna heat			2
why sleep naked ? disrupted sleep from being too hot does n’t just mean you ’ll get less sleep overall , but it might mean less deep sleep , the most restorative type @entity95 bed socks for a hot water bottle though it ’s important not to get too hot at night , make sure you have warm hands and feet			1
that ’s because for your temperature to lower to the level that triggers sound sleep , your body needs to lose excess heat			1
it does this by sending blood to the vessels near skin — in particular , those on the hands and feet — where heat is lost through the skin surface			0
however , as professor @entity66 explains , if your hands and feet are cold , the blood vessels next to the skin constrict and reduce blood flow in an effort to keep warm and stop heat escaping			0
this in turn means your core temperature wo n’t be able to drop so easily			0
this is why people with @entity128 ’s syndrome — a disorder characterised by extremely cold hands and feet ( thought to affect up to ten million people in the @entity132 , including 10 per cent of all women ) are more likely to suffer with insomnia			2
the condition causes the blood vessels in the extremities to spasm , reducing blood flow , so though sufferers ’ hands and feet may feel very cold , their core temperature is too high			0
older people tend to feel the cold at night , probably because circulation problems become more common			0
women are also more likely to suffer with cold hands and feet , especially at certain points in the menstrual cycle — oestrogen regulates the peripheral blood vessels in the hands and feet , and high levels can make them more sensitive to temperature			2
a 2008 study by the @entity155 demonstrated the importance of body temperature in sleep			1
volunteers slept wearing thermosuits , allowing researchers to manipulate their skin temperature without altering core temperature			2
the team found that when skin temperature was raised by just 0.4 ° c , the volunteers were significantly less likely to wake in the night			2
in elderly volunteers , the effect was pronounced : the 0.4 ° c rise almost doubled the proportion of deep sleep and decreased the risk of waking too early from 50 per cent to four per cent			1
warming the skin caused blood vessels in the extremities to widen , so heat could be lost more easily			0
‘ they promoted sleep by raising skin temperature , allowing heat to flow from the middle of the body and the core temperature to fall slightly , ’ says professor @entity66			2
in other words , to fall asleep easily , you need to be warm enough that your blood vessels wo n’t constrict , but not so hot that your body ca n’t cool down			0
to ensure body temperature drops sufficiently , swap bed socks for a hot water bottle , says dr @entity48			2
‘ bed socks do n’t allow you to lose heat from your feet , so you ’ll end up too hot , ’ he says			2
‘ hot water bottles get your feet warm , but then they cool down or can be kicked out of the way			0
’ your bed partner can also be helpful for regulating your body temperature			2
‘ if you ’re cold , you can snuggle up to them and once you ’re warm , you can move away , ’ says professor @entity66			0
people who sleep naked have happier love lives , according to a survey of 1,000 @entity132 adults by a bedsheet company this year sleep in the buff to burn calories there is an increasing focus on brown fat , a type of tissue in the body that may protect against weight gain			1
while ordinary body fat piles on when we eat more calories than we burn , brown fat seems to burn excess calories to generate heat			1
we know babies have lots of brown fat — they need it to keep warm — but studies have shown there are small amounts in the necks of adults , too			2
experts believe that certain activities could switch on this fat , potentially helping to burn calories at a greater rate			1
in a @entity15 study in the journal @entity234 , researchers found that sleeping in a cold bedroom could activate brown fat in adults			1
five healthy young men slept in climate - controlled bedrooms for four months			0
for the first month , the room was kept at 24 ° c , then it was lowered to 19 ° c , then it went back to 24 ° c and for the last month raised to 27 ° @entity242 they ate the same amount of calories and their calorie expenditure and insulin sensitivity — how much insulin the body needs to keep blood sugar levels stable — were measured each day			2
after four weeks sleeping at 19 ° c , the men had almost doubled their volumes of brown fat			2
‘ the roughened surface provides a warmer feel as it holds air that insulates you			0
’ natural fibres such as wool , cotton or silk ‘ have a good humidity buffering capacity ( they absorb moisture ) , which will feel better in bed ’			2
tests showed they burned more calories throughout the day when their bedroom was cooler ( though not enough to lose weight ) and their insulin sensitivity had also improved			2
senior author @entity272 said the study showed that over time sleeping in a cold bedroom could lessen the risk of diabetes			1
@entity277 , professor of developmental physiology at the @entity278 and an expert on brown fat , says sleeping naked may be beneficial			1
‘ @entity282 fat can produce 300 times more heat than any other body organ , meaning if you can keep it activated for a prolonged amount of time you ’d be less likely to lay down excess energy			0
‘ so anything you can do to try to activate it , such as lowering the thermostat and sleeping in the cold , may be of benefit			0
’ but room temperature should n’t be below a level at which you feel comfortable , otherwise you wo n’t sleep			0
people who tend to feel hot at night and like to sleep naked , may have a high amount of brown fat , which causes them to feel warmer than others			1
... and lower @entity301 cosy pyjamas are tempting , but if you share a bed with a partner , going nude will generate a generous boost of oxytocin , a hormone that ’s been shown to have a wealth of health benefits			1
‘ it is triggered by closeness , particularly skin - to - skin contact , ’ says dr @entity311 , a physiologist at the @entity312 and an expert on oxytocin			0
‘ sensory nerves on the skin send impulses to the brain , triggering the release			0
‘ when a baby is placed on its mother ’s chest , the blood in mother and child starts to pulse with oxytocin			0
’ oxytocin has a protective effect on the heart , as it lowers blood pressure			0
it also boosts the immune system and reduces anxiety			0
‘ but it only works if skin - on - skin touching is something you ’re happy with			0
’ give your love life a boost people who sleep naked have happier love lives , according to a survey of 1,000 @entity132 adults by a bedsheet company this year			1
the study found 57 per cent of nude sleepers were happy with their relationship , compared with 48 per cent of pyjama wearers and 43 per cent of nightie wearers ( onesie wearers were just 38 per cent )			1
sleeping naked is a good strategy for those with body image issues , says @entity359 , sex therapist at counselling charity relate			1
‘ you can slip under the sheets and then take your clothes off , and then you can be touched , even if you do n’t want to be looked at			0
’ sleeping naked may increase the chances of sex			1
‘ @entity366 might give the message “ not tonight ” , but equally a lot of couples have a lot of fun taking each other ’s clothes off			0
’ stop getting infections wearing nothing to bed can help women avoid developing yeast infections , such as thrush , says @entity380 , a consultant gynaecologist at @entity381 in @entity382			1
‘ @entity383 loves warm , restricted environments , so wear something loose or preferably nothing at all			0
‘ if you wear something tight it means less air gets to the area and you ’re more likely to sweat , which can cause irritation			0

one in three adults sleep in the nude according to a study by @entity15 experts
they found sleeping naked helps burn calories and improves sleep quality
those who sleep naked have happier love lives and lower risk of diabetes
