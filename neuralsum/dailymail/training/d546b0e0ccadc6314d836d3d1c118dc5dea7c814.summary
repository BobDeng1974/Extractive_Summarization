by @entity0 most of us know that feeling , the morning after the night before , when we wake up and say ‘ never again ’			0
scientists have now discovered the area of the brain that gives us that hangover feeling - and suggest it is vital to stopping us drinking too much , too often			2
neuroscientists at the @entity11 hope their discovery could lead to better treatments for alcoholics			1
the morning after : neuroscientists at the @entity11 have narrowed down drinking to one area of the brain , the lateral habenula ( file picture ) professor @entity20 , who led the study in rats , said : ‘ in people , escalation of intake is what eventually separates a social drinker from someone who becomes an alcoholic			1
’ the research , published in the journal @entity32 , found that when a region of the brain called the lateral habenula is chronically inactivated in rats , they repeatedly drink to excess and are less able to learn from the experience			1
the scientists think the lateral habenula is activated by bad experiences , suggesting that when it is faulty or underactive people may be more inclined to repeat unhealthy behaviour			1
they gave rats access to a strong alcoholic drink over a period of several weeks			0
the animals which had a disabled lateral habenula drank more heavily than those which did not			1
prof @entity20 added : ‘ these rats drink amounts that are quite substantial			0
legally they would be drunk if they were driving			0
‘ it ’s the same kind of learning that mediates your response in food poisoning			0
you taste something and then you get sick , and then of course you avoid that food in future meals			0
‘ yet rats with an inactivated lateral habenula sought out the juice more than control animals , even though it meant a repeat of the bad experience			1
‘ if we can understand the brain circuits that control sensitivity to alcohol ’s aversive effects , then we can start to get a handle on who may become a problem drinker			2
’ progress : the study suggests that when the circuits in the brain linked to alcohol 's adverse effects are fully understood , a treatment for problem drinking can be developed ( file picture ) the group ’s findings may help explain results from previous clinical investigations demonstrating that men who were less sensitive to the negative effects of alcohol drank more heavily , and were more likely to become problem drinkers later in life			1
the researchers think the lateral habenula likely works in one of two ways			2
. the region may regulate how badly an individual feels after over-drinking			0
alternatively , it may control how well an individual learns from their bad experience			2
co-author @entity108 added : ‘ the way i look at it is the rewarding effects of drinking alcohol compete with the aversive effects			0
‘ when you take the aversive effects away , which is what we did when we inactivated the lateral habenula , the rewarding effects gain more purchase , and so it drives up drinking behaviour			1

study by @entity11 suggests drinking is liked to an area of the brain
*section* , known as the lateral habenula , is activated by bad experiences
leads ' faulty or inactive ' people to repeat ' unhealthy behavior '
neuroscientists hope discovery can lead to better treatment for alcoholics
