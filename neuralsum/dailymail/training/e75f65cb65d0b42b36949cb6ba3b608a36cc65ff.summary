@entity2 , as he is known , has been bringing festive cheer to @entity4 every @entity11 for the last 48 years , and has won awards for his superb @entity2 skills			2
mr @entity1 first put on his red suit to deliver his son 's @entity11 presents back in 1964			1
he enjoyed it so much he began playing @entity2 for his friend 's children too , before moving into grottoes and using his jolly demeanour to raise money for charity			1
during his years of service , @entity2 has heard hundreds of thousands of children 's @entity11 lists , delivered hundreds of sacks of presents and raised thousands of pounds for charity			1
he has visited children at an orphanage in the @entity32 , attended @entity2 conferences and competitions in @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 and was crowned the @entity38 's @entity2 in 2004			1

he said : ' i started dressing up as @entity2 when my son @entity47 was young , friends of mine then asked if i could come round and visit their children and it just snowballed from there			2
' i just loved seeing the surprise and happiness i could bring to people			0
' on christmas morning i visit lots of different families i leave around 7.30 in the morning and i 'm home in time for my @entity11 dinner at 2.30 in the afternoon			0
@entity58 of @entity59 : @entity2 , far left , won the title of @entity38 's @entity2 in 2004 ' during my @entity11 visits , i arrive ringing my bell , the parents usually leave the presents in the porch or on the doorstep for me and i put them in my sack and deliver them to the children			1
' to see the look on their faces when i arrive is wonderful , i spend time chatting to the children and pose for photos with the family			0
' it just makes @entity11 morning that little bit more magical , when i leave the house and everyone is smiling it makes it all worthwhile			0
' i really enjoyed competing in the competitions , i have both a bronze and a gold medal			0
and being named @entity38 's @entity2 was a proud moment			1
' the highlight of my career has to be seeing the smiles on the faces of the children i visited at an orphanage in the @entity32			0
' they were the most fantastic children i 've ever came across , they were so loving and appreciative			0
' wishing you a @entity92 : @entity2 shows off his diploma from @entity44 , left , and tends to @entity94 , right despite admitting he is now a little old to compete in the competitions , @entity2 still refuses to be photographed without his suit on and continues to visit children on christmas day and help raise money for his local church			1
he has now opened his own @entity2 school in the hope of continuing his legacy by teaching others how to become the perfect @entity2			2
he said : ' i take my job as @entity2 very seriously , it is n't just about dressing up in a red suit and saying @entity107 ! ' @entity108 is about about listening to the children and making them feel special			2
season 's greetings : the 77 - year - old has visited children at an orphanage in the @entity32 , attended @entity2 conferences and taken part in competitions in @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 time for a mince pie ! @entity2 delivers gifts to his delighted neighbours @entity121 and @entity122 ' you have to be as excited and enthusiastic with the last child you see on a day as you were with the first			2
it 's important you do n't wain			0
' it 's jolly hard work you have to make sure each child leaves thinking @entity11 is wonderful			0
' a good @entity2 must n't use bad language and should never smoke or drink in their suit , there 's nothing worse than a smelly @entity2			2
' they should always look their best and be a jolly good listener			0
