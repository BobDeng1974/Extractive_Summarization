by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 17 october 2013 the unfortunate ‘ monkey ’ joke is the latest in a series of race rows to blight @entity6 football			0
most famously , @entity7 lost the captaincy of the national team in the furore over his alleged racial abuse of @entity12			2
his case , which dominated headlines for months , came less than a year after @entity16 ’s @entity15 was banned for eight games for a racial offence			1
but aside from these high - profile cases , race has become a hugely sensitive issue around the game			0
gaffe : @entity25 's unfortunate ‘ monkey ’ joke is the latest in a series of race rows to blight @entity6 football such is the paranoia over causing racial offence that even the most innocuous remarks can prompt a rapid public retraction			1
only this week @entity34 ’s football anchorman @entity33 was forced to apologise for comments made about @entity37 builders ahead of the @entity39 qualifier between @entity40 and @entity37			0
@entity16 player @entity15 ( left ) was found guilty of racially abusing @entity42 's @entity41 ( right ) @entity33 said : ‘ it ’s practically a home game for @entity37 – 15,000 @entity37 will be here , i ’m sure			1
’ when fellow pundit @entity45 responded : ‘ hopefully , they ’re all crying at the end ’ @entity33 added : ‘ i ’m trying to get some building work done at the moment , quite seriously			0
’ despite widespread support on @entity53 , @entity33 , whose mother is @entity54 , was made to apologise , saying : ‘ i made the remark in relation to the nice @entity37 builders currently working at my place , who i knew would already be fed up having watched their team lose to @entity62			0
‘ no offence was intended – apart from anything else i could hardly be prouder of my east @entity66 background			2
' but to anyone who thought what i said constituted some kind of lazy stereotyping , and was offended by it , i certainly apologise			0
’ @entity73 captain @entity7 was banned for four matches by the @entity75 in september 2012 and fined a record £ 220,000 for using racist language against @entity78 player @entity12 during a match at @entity80 in october of the previous year			1
two months earlier @entity7 had been cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence at @entity82 , but the @entity75 brought disciplinary charges under its own rules			1
the fine – for the words ‘ f * * * * * * black * * * * ’ – was the highest ever levied on an individual by the @entity75 , and corresponded to @entity7 ’s weekly wage at @entity73			1
in december 2011 , @entity15 was also found guilty of racial abuse			2
different extremes : @entity33 comments about @entity37 builders after @entity40 's win over @entity94 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) leaves court after being cleared of racially abusing @entity12 he was handed an eight - match ban and fined £ 40,000 after clashing with @entity42 ’s @entity41 during a game at @entity98 two months earlier			1
but football has come a long way from the @entity101 , when monkey chants followed the first black soccer players whenever they touched the ball			0
in august it emerged that every senior player in the @entity107 and @entity108 must attend a session this season to receive guidance on racist and homophobic language			2
the @entity113 , is organising the sessions .			0

@entity16 's @entity15 was banned for eight games for a racial offence
