he just turned 65 - years - old in october			1
but @entity1 is showing no signs of slowing down			2
in fact , the @entity4 star is speeding up his life by entering the dangerous five - day baja 1000 race with his lesser - known son @entity7 , according to @entity8			1
the competition , which begins wednesday , has seen several drivers die in the past few years due to high speeds and challenging conditions on the off road course through the @entity16 desert			1
his son will take on the first 400 miles and the former @entity35 will do the next segment			1
but he will hand over the keys again to @entity7 for the big finish			1
last year 30 - year - old @entity40 star @entity39 was killed during the competition			1
several drivers , and even spectators , have died during the race			2
it 's official : both @entity1 and @entity7 , along with @entity46 , have their name on the poster for the event which will take place from november 12 to 16 like big kids during @entity53 : the father and son duo posing with a toy car in the spring this is an odd choice for @entity22 , who has been seen in recent months with a more feminine body , longer hair and manicured nails			1
but it may be a way for him to get closer to his son @entity7 , who he had with his first wife @entity64 ( they were man and wife from 1972 to 1981 )			1
they also had a child named @entity70			0
@entity1 had @entity71 and @entity72 with wife @entity73 ( they were wed from 1981 to 1985 ) , and daughters @entity75 and @entity77 with @entity24 ( who he married in 1991 but split from in 2013 )			0
is this their race car ? : the keeping up with the @entity4 star posing with son @entity7 ( far left ) and @entity72 ( right ) in front of the @entity46 / @entity22 vehicle that looks like it will be used during the race in @entity16 he still has the ring on : the former @entity35 spotted leaving @entity86 in @entity87 in @entity88 , which is not far from the @entity90 mansion he used to share with @entity24 , on thursday she seems to have moved on nicely : the 59 - year - old matriarch with her reported beau @entity94 ( left ) , @entity95 and @entity96 at the rapper 's birthday party on sunday the @entity21 race has $ 1m in sponsorships from companies such as @entity102			1
the entrance fee is at least $ 125,000			0
trucks used in the race cost about $ 500,000			0
then there is the cost of being on the road for five days which can be steep			2
the site reported that @entity1 is not using any of his own money for this			0
the reality star is reportedly worth around $ 100m			2
she will most likely not be at the race : the @entity31 star seen in @entity116 on monday ; the beauty has not been pictured with @entity1 since it was reported he was dating her old friend @entity118 @entity22 was last seen at a @entity86 in @entity87 , which is not far from the @entity90 mansion he used to share with @entity24 , on thursday			2
he wore his hair in a ponytail and looked trim in a blue top and jeans			0
the avid golfer was still wearing his wedding band from momager @entity24 even though he is reportedly dating his estranged wife 's old friend @entity118			0
the @entity4 are on the air currently with @entity134 & @entity133			0
they are also shooting season 10 of keeping up with @entity4			0
the girls keep on partying : ( from left ) @entity137 , @entity77 and @entity96 at @entity139 's bash in @entity116			0
