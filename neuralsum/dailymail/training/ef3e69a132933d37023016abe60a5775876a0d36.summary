he now has four goals this season and @entity29 , who scored a hat - trick continues his incredible goal a game record			1

but still he climbed above the @entity6 defence and looped a header past keeper @entity66 to score his first goal on this ground in his fourth visit , on the half hour			1
he celebrated – from a seated position inside the penalty area – with his now trademark hands out palms - down calm down gesture : do not fear , @entity0 is here			2
six minutes later @entity4 had doubled their lead and @entity39 had his first league goal for the club			2
he broke his duck in midweek in the @entity111 with a tap - in from a rebound , this was a little bit more like that @entity116 wonder - goal volley against @entity117			0
on the left - hand side of the penalty area he received the ball from @entity56 and curled a shot into @entity66 ’ top corner with the @entity124 keeper helplessly flapping as it sailed past him			0

@entity52 played the ball forward to @entity56 and he was scythed down by @entity66 rushing out from his goal			0
the loose ball ran to @entity0 and he put it into the empty net with the keeper saved from a red card but @entity6 having to restart the game for the third time in the first 45 minutes			2
@entity4 had made hard work of breaking @entity6 down			2
@entity1 had seen plenty of the ball but when he dropped one perfect right footed cross on @entity0 's head the @entity137 headed straight at the keeper			2
summer signing @entity39 scores a brilliant second goal for the visitors on saturday afternoon @entity145 midfielder @entity39 runs away to celebrate his first league goal for @entity148 's side @entity56 ( r ) congratulates @entity0 after the @entity137 scored @entity4 's third and his second of the rout @entity1 should have put @entity4 ahead but shot straight at the keeper from close range after @entity56 ’s shot was parried by @entity66 and he then should have been played in by @entity29 but the former @entity11 man snatched at a shot instead of playing the pass			1
but , once @entity0 had found his range , @entity148 ’s side just moved up through the gears and looked far superior to their opponents			0
@entity6 have been reading too many ' @entity4 in crisis ' stories - throwing men forward at will and leaving huge space in behind			2
they made two changes at half time with @entity78 and former @entity166 midfielder @entity73 hooked and soon they had narrowed the margin			0
@entity50 was adjudged to have handled in the area and @entity169 sent @entity48 the wrong way from the penalty spot			0
it was harsh on @entity50 who claimed the ball hit his side but the finish had been emphatic			0
@entity6 ’s tails were up and @entity48 had to save from @entity75			0
defensive midfielder @entity177 replaced forward @entity56 as @entity148 tried to close the game down			0
a fourth goal was always going to have the same effect and @entity1 delivered it wrapping his foot around a @entity52 pass to send it first time past the luckless @entity66			0
@entity1 scores the first of his two second - half goals as @entity4 stepped up their domestic form @entity6 keeper @entity66 sees the ball pass him for a fifth time as @entity1 gets his quickfire double @entity1 's brace took his season 's tally to four goals for the former @entity196 winger ronaldo scores @entity4 's sixth goal , and his 23rd hat - trick for the @entity201 giants @entity55 gives @entity0 a high five after his hat - trick made it six for the irepressible @entity4 with @entity56 off , @entity1 and @entity0 were now up - front in a 4 - 4 - 2 with @entity148 showing no signs of moving @entity1 further from goal as has been suggested to him			1
@entity1 had responded with @entity4 's fourth goal and his third of the season and soon he scored the fifth and his second of the afternoon from an @entity57 pass			1
@entity0 completed his hat - trick from another @entity57 pass and there was still time for @entity8 to get in on the act			1
‘ @entity8 ’ had replaced @entity1 and he hammered home from the edge of the area to score his first and repeated the trick in injury time to make it 8 - 2			1
after the game @entity50 was asked if 12 goals in two games put paid to @entity4 ’s crisis			0
he said : ‘ this can be a difficult place to come but we won the ball back well and kept the intensity up throughout			0
we had not made the best of starts to the season but we showed what we can do in midweek against @entity236 and we repeated it here			0
