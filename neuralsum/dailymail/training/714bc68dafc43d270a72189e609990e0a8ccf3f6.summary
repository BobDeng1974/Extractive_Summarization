changes : @entity2 's department of pure mathematics is said to have submitted a report to the @entity24 outlining how new - style maths a-levels should be structured @entity2 wants changes to be made because most talented students who it recruits do n’t have sufficient basic maths skills to help them ‘ confidently engage anything other than routine problems ’			1
‘ existing a-level curriculums treat topics superficially and the @entity7 has lost the tradition of teaching school mathematics coherently and in depth , ’ the report said			0
‘ the effect on @entity2 is acute			2
’ the document by department head professor @entity44 suggests that a-levels should be focused around a series of ‘ key mathematical ideas ’ , reported the @entity48			2
this is expected to include combinatorics , trigonometry , complex numbers , centres of mass and probability			0
in addition it recommends ‘ graded sets of problems ’ should be set for bright teenagers			0
plans : mathematicians at the world - famous university will script new syllabuses and exam questions as part of the government 's reforms to drive up education standards , it was reported today most of the assessments will be focused towards all students , but the university is also suggesting the creation of a ‘ range of demanding questions to challenge the most able ’			1
' existing a-level curriculums treat topics superficially and the @entity7 has lost the tradition of teaching school mathematics coherently and in depth ' @entity2 report the government announced earlier this year that it intends to give universities , particularly the most elite institutions , a ‘ far greater role ’ in designing a-levels in the future			2
it comes amid concerns that the qualifications are failing to prepare teenagers for degree study			0
but a leading higher education group has said it is against the plan			0
@entity98 said it does not believe it would be ‘ advisable or feasible ’ for the sector to ‘ take ownership ’ of the qualifications .			0

*academics* to write syllabuses and questions as part of @entity84 reforms
@entity2 maths department tells @entity24 how to structure new - style a-levels
its recruits ca *n't* ' confidently engage anything other than routine problems '
