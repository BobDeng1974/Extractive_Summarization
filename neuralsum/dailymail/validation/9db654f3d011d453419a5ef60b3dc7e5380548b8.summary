the @entity0 are set to conduct a ' major review ' into the reasons behind the national team 's early @entity4 exit , although managing director @entity6 does not expect any changes in the short term			1
coach @entity10 ' position has most significantly come under fire after a campaign in which @entity0 were rarely competitive , losing four of their five games , to crash out of the tournament with friday 's final group game against @entity17 still to play			1
@entity6 has the power in his hands to end @entity10 ' second spell in charge but in the wake of monday 's 15 - run defeat to @entity24 he has so far sought to back the man he described as ' the outstanding coach of his generation ' when he appointed him last april			1
@entity10 ' place as @entity0 coach is safe in the short - term , says @entity0 managing director @entity6 @entity34 's position as captain is in question after @entity0 's early exit from the @entity4 it is high praise that @entity6 still believes @entity10 is worthy despite an unconvincing record , albeit with a remodelled team , soured further by events over the past month			1
' as far as his ability is concerned i still feel he is a very high - quality coach , so , no nothing has changed since we appointed him 11 months ago , ' @entity6 said			1
@entity6 says no decisions on the future of players or staff , including @entity10 , would be made immediately but a review will take place ' you do n't become a bad coach overnight but the scale of the issues we have got to deal with are significant as everybody has seen			1
' @entity0 fly out to the @entity59 for a test series early next month and while it appears any fall - out from the @entity0 review is unlikely to strike before then , @entity6 did baulk at the opportunity to guarantee that @entity10 would remain in charge			1
' all i have said is that we 're still within the first year of his appointment , ' he said			0
' we clearly will have a major review of what 's happened in the last six months but particularly during the @entity4			2
' everybody is extremely raw from yesterday 's experience but we still have a game left in the @entity4 , so no decisions are going to be made in the short term			2
' in less than a month we will be in the @entity75 playing @entity76 so i do n't envisage any short - term changes			0
' the upcoming review could also leave @entity80 to feel at some unease			0
the 57 - year - old was not employed by incoming chairman @entity83 or @entity84 , who was appointed as the @entity0 's chief executive officer last october			2
@entity6 will be answerable to both although he has not felt the need to ask for any assurances after revealing they had met for discussions as recently as monday while @entity0 's tournament - ending defeat was ongoing in @entity92			1
' i 've worked with @entity83 on the board for the last year			0
he 's been extremely supportive of everything we 've done , ' he said			0
@entity24 players celebrates after their victory over @entity0 that eliminated @entity34 's side from the @entity4 @entity6 says incoming @entity0 chairman @entity83 , who did not appoint him , has been supportive ' @entity84 has been with us for two months and we 've spent a lot of time together			1
both have been extremely supportive in what we 're doing			0
' @entity0 fans had been warned to expect tough times ahead after last winter 's ashes whitewash and @entity10 was tasked with an unenviable task of rebuilding a side that had lost the considerable experience of @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 following his well - publicised falling out with the @entity0			1
the former @entity113 coach has attempted to bring young players through and @entity0 's performances immediately suffered as they succumbed to a first - ever home test series defeat to @entity117			2
they bounced back strongly to beat @entity119 after falling behind in that series , but since then @entity0 have struggled in the one - day arena , losing 18 of 27 games under @entity10 , and the gulf in class between them and the best nations was powerfully illustrated during the @entity4			1
' we 're in the middle of a very significant rebuilding phase , ' @entity6 said			0
' we offered six new central contracts during the summer			0
my first job when i came in here was to try to re-establish a test side which we made progress with in the summer			0
' the next job was to get to the @entity4 with as competitive a side as we could			0
we always knew we coming from behind			0
@entity0 vice-captain looks dejected after top - scoring with 65 in their loss to @entity24 on monday @entity10 endures the post-match press conference after his side fell 15 runs short of their target ' all i will tell you is that there are no quick fixes in this situation			1
look through history , look at any very successful side which has broken up , how long it takes sometimes to rebuild again			0
' i am very confident that in a year 's time , in two years ' time this group of players will be battle - hardened and will be more competitive			0
' while one - day cricket will take a back seat over the next 12 months , when @entity0 will embark on a gruelling schedule of @entity161 , the @entity0 will use the review to look into ways to ensure the national team can be competitive when the @entity4 comes to these shores in 2019			1
@entity0 's senior players are set to be consulted and @entity6 suggested the possibility of a specific selector for @entity169 would be discussed			2
meanwhile , all - rounders @entity170 and @entity172 are fitness doubts for the match against @entity17 after they both suffered injuries in the defeat to @entity24			2
@entity170 left the @entity178 with his left foot in a protective boot after feeling pain during his late bid to save @entity0 's @entity4 while @entity172 suffered side injury while bowling			2
both players are set to have scans in @entity187 on wednesday .			0
