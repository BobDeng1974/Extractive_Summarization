with the stripes of a zebra and the tongue of a giraffe , okapis are constantly compared to their more recognisable cousins			2
but today at @entity7 , the reclusive okapis commanded the public 's attention			2
the notoriously shy creatures made a public appearance at the zoo , where the newborn okapi took her first steps outdoors			1
unusual : visitors at @entity7 would have to look closely to see that these bizarre - looking creatures are n't zebras or striped horses maternal instinct : @entity20 takes her first steps outdoors with her mother 's encouragement the baby okapi , named @entity24 , took tentative steps outside the stable doors in her enclosure			1
the apprehensive foal was encouraged by her mother , @entity29 , who nuzzled her young in an affectionate display			2
@entity7 was the first in the @entity33 to care for an okapi in 1961 and the first @entity33 zoo to breed one in 1963			1
since then , 37 foals have been born at the zoo			1
okapis are also bred in @entity39 and @entity40			0
the okapi 's striking markings are on the back of its legs so its offspring can follow it through dense jungle			1
inseparable : @entity20 is the latest addition to the 37 foals that have been born at @entity7 known as the ' @entity49 unicorn ' the herbivore has a long blue tongue that strips leaves from branches			0
the female okapi has one foal every two years			1
their pregnancy lasts 15 months and foals typically stay with their mother for two or three years			0
@entity7 helps to fund the 8,000 square mile @entity61 in the @entity62			0
the okapi was first discovered in the @entity62 in 1901			1
after increasingly rarer sightings , it vanished from the wildlife radar for decades from 1959 , prompting fears that it had died out			0
but eight years ago researchers working for the @entity70 found okapi tracks in the wild			2
so little was known about the mysterious okapi until the early 20th century that the @entity74 believed it was a mythical animal and called it the ‘ @entity49 unicorn ’			2
the breed was discovered by the @entity33 governor of @entity81 sir @entity80 in 1901 in the densest parts of forest in the @entity62			1
since then , conservation projects have worked to find out more about the creature , but it is a relatively new species			0
the mammal , which is a cousin of the giraffe , is timid and reclusive			0
they have long and strong tongues like giraffes that can reach high branches and strip them of their leaves			0
their long legs and sturdy body have striped markings that can either serve as camouflage or as a guide to their calves when deep in the forest			0
okapis are believed to be threatened with extinction in the near future			0
civil war in the @entity62 has had a devastating impact on the species			0
the main threats to okapi come from hunters and the destruction of their habitat			2
@entity29 , the mother okapi at @entity116 zoo , was born at @entity117 in 2001			1
she was transferred to the @entity33 from a zoo in @entity119 .			1

@entity116 zoo was the first in the @entity33 to care for an okapi
