no matter how highly you rate the catalytic impact of @entity3 on @entity5 ’s international football or the complementary consistence of vision and patience of @entity9 , it ’s essential to view @entity12 ’s hungry , aggressive , visionary and ambitious impact while technical director as fundamental			1
the cumulative process of their work took a decade to reach fruition and was , admittedly , fuelled by root and branch change across @entity5 ’s club and administrative networks			1
yet from the lowest points of their mannschaft ’s decline ( @entity26 elimination at @entity27 ) to achieving third and second - place finishes at @entity29 and then @entity30 , the time lapses were two and four years respectively			2
new era : @entity33 congratulates his players after a successful friendly against @entity37 semi-finalists @entity38 shocked : @entity39 crashed out of the @entity37 , along with @entity40 , after losing to @entity41 the right people , the right talent and the right attitudes can galvanize even a moribund situation			1
coincidentally , the two biggest early setbacks the @entity48 renaissance suffered were being hammered 4 - 1 by @entity39 in march 2006 and then losing an epic @entity37 semi-final to the @entity39 in @entity50 later that year			2
champions that tournament , the @entity54 were then first - round , eight - stone weaklings in each of the next two @entity57			1
for that reason , they are now in the hands of a man who unites one or two of the qualities of each of those three @entity48 who , between them , hauled their national team up by the scruff of the neck to produce finishes of : third ; second ; third equal and first from 2006 - 2014			2
like ‘ @entity3 ’ , @entity33 is quite prepared to swim against the tide in terms of what it feels the entire nation believes or assumes			1
his drive for reform , rejuvenation is zealous			2
revolution : @entity12 was crucial in driving @entity5 to change after @entity27 low point : @entity80 scores to knock @entity5 out of @entity27 in the @entity26 stage final chapter : ten years after their @entity84 disaster @entity9 had led @entity5 to the @entity37 like @entity9 , who used his total admiration for the @entity88 football school to draw inspiration for a definitive vision of how @entity5 should play , the 45 - year - old @entity54 possesses a crystal - clear notion of how he wants the @entity39 to attack , defend , press , use width and to adopt a new level of dedication to winning			1
but @entity33 most resembles @entity12			1
not , before you splutter toast crumbs into your sunday morning cuppa , as a footballer			2
ironically enough the @entity48 was a @entity100 of a player while the @entity54 ... a humble but redoubtable @entity102			1
‘ i realised from the start of my @entity111 career i ’d have to work twice as hard as my team - mates to survive at that club , ’ is his candid admission of the technical gap between himself and the majority of @entity108 ’s squad			2
‘ but , a coach ? i always knew i could become a good coach			1
i ’m made to show a direction , to add method , to create a squad			2
’ what he most shares with @entity12 now is a defiant belief that hard work , aggression , cracking the whip to get more out of everyone around him , vision , philosophy and a nuclear level of personal drive can achieve anything			1
prior to thursday ’s 2 - 0 victory over @entity136 ’s @entity38 in @entity137 ( in front of a remarkable crowd of 50,000 ) there were signs that @entity33 was going to apply very literally the advice of one of the two great coaching figures in his illustrious career — @entity108			1
the great man counselled him : ‘ in the @entity147 , they really want a guy to shake up the environment — it ’s the key task now			2
' all great coaches aim to take over the national team one day and my advice is : “ do n’t even change one jot of the attitude which gave you such incredible results at @entity111			0
be just the same man with the national team as you were with the club ”			0
’ evidence ? @entity162 dropped , @entity163 left on the bench against @entity38 so that @entity166 ‘ my horse is like a member of the family ’ @entity165 could keep goal			1
more ? pizzas and bread are suddenly banned around the @entity39 training camp , with @entity33 ’s players now being asked to eat six times a day when on national team duty			1
breakfast , mid-training snack , lunch , mid-afternoon snack , light dinner then a late - night supper — all aimed at achieving what they term ‘ glycemic calm ’			0
whether this can positively affect his stars when they only gather with the national team a handful of times per season and then eat either at their own discretion or under club rules the rest of the time is debatable			0
big call : @entity33 dropped veteran keeper @entity163 for the @entity38 game on thursday night replacement : @entity198 was preferred to @entity163 on thursday and could keep his place against @entity200 dropped : @entity162 was not included in @entity33 's squad and will have to work hard to return for @entity39 motivation : @entity33 has a philosophy of hard work @entity33 knows it but his attitude is : ‘ my way is the only way and it will be enforced here			1
if you do n’t like it , do n’t turn up			1
’ it is , already , the hour for young bucks like @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 to show that this is their era			1
starting against @entity200 on tuesday			0
some of the @entity33 impact is already totally evident			1
he defines himself thus : ‘ football is an obsession			2
i get home and put the tv on to watch it			0
apart from football , i read			2
i read stories of great men			0
of those who have written pages of history			0
i need to expand my wealth of knowledge			0
’ notwithstanding the fine rhetoric , reaching out for greatness often implies ruthlessness			0
the end , if successful , is praised			0
however the means are n’t always regarded as justifiable while being applied			0
@entity3 was derided as a new - age @entity239			0
@entity9 criticised for being too pseudo-spanish , not ruthlessly @entity48 enough			0
@entity12 ’s brash , outspoken nature puts hackles up			1
@entity33 quit @entity111 after pre- season had just begun			1
however , there are also underlying themes			0
he ’d previously warned of his feelings on elimination from the @entity251 in 2013 , saying : ‘ right now , @entity54 club football is n’t competitive at the top level of @entity254			1
i ’m sorry to have to say it but it ’s true			0
‘ people can either face the truth or bury their heads but i ’m going to push on and try to change it			0
some will try to avoid reality and say that in two or three years then @entity262 or @entity263 or @entity264 or @entity111 can win the @entity251			0
but when was the last time @entity54 clubs were reaching @entity254 finals ? ‘ what we need is intelligence , clear debate and work , work , work			1
we need that so players , coaches , experts , media , ex-players , administrators ... everyone , unites to try to make our game grow			2
‘ but , i ’m sad , we ’ve simply been interested in “ polemic ” in @entity39 in recent years			0
what a referee says or does , who a player is going out with , that type of rubbish			0
trivia instead of serious matters			0
and so nothing gets done			0

like @entity12 in @entity5 , @entity33 can turn @entity54 football around
coach is bringing in a new era with new exciting players
@entity33 is prepared to swim against the *current* and *introduce* a new philosophy
veteran keeper @entity163 was dropped for friendly victory over @entity38
younger players like @entity214 and @entity216 coming through
@entity33 also targeting players ' diet in *wholesale* changes
