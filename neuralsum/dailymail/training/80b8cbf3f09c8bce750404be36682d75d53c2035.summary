by @entity0 the beloved children ’s cartoon @entity1 celebrates its 75th anniversary this year , and to commemorate the occasion , the @entity6 is staging a retrospective of the work of its creator @entity10			1
more than 100 of his pieces , including original drawings from the @entity1 books , are displayed in @entity1 in @entity16 : the @entity17 – which marks his first solo show in close to 50 years			1
@entity1 , a series of six books ( the first edition of which was published in 1939 ) , is beloved worldwide for its expression of sweet sentiments and strong will			0
a classic : @entity10 's career is celebrated in a new exhibit at the @entity6 , where his drawings , including those from @entity1 , are on display ( pictured , ' @entity1 at the @entity33 ' , an oil on canvas from 1955 ) singular approach : in the @entity38 , the title protagonist is a schoolgirl in @entity40 , and is shown escorted by a religious headmaster ( pictured , a dummy cover by @entity10 for the title @entity1 and the @entity44 c. 1956 , pen , ink , watercolor , and gouache ) original works : the exhibit includes original paintings from the first @entity1 , like this page showing the schoolgirls in mid-winter ( dated , 1939 , watercolor and gouache ) the @entity58 - winning book follows the life of title protagonist @entity1 – the small , singularly red - headed student enrolled in a @entity63 boarding school in @entity40 – alongside her fellow classmates , schoolmaster @entity65 , and neighborhood friend @entity66			1
the first book famously starts with an illustration depicting @entity1 and her fellow students filing behind their schoolmaster , accompanied by the inimitable intro line : ‘ in an old house in @entity40 that was covered in vines , lived twelve little girls in two straight lines ... ’ the @entity1 character , as @entity10 dreamed her to be , wore an endearing school uniform of a yellow sailor hat and blue overcoat – standing out from the rest of her classmates not only because of her fiery hair , but also her feisty personality			2
though the stories are based in the @entity87 capital , @entity1 fans may be surprised to hear that the series is a thoroughly @entity16 phenomenon			2
on the road : @entity1 has since become a successful tv series as well as a feature film ( pictured , a sketch from @entity94 , 1959 ) @entity16 roots : while @entity1 is based in @entity40 , the story was written and drawn in @entity16 ( pictured , a scene from @entity98 , 1953 ) humble beginnings : @entity10 wrote the manuscript for @entity1 on the backside of a menu at @entity104 's @entity103 ( pictured , a drawing from @entity106 , c. 1956 ) @entity10 wrote the first book in a corner booth at the famous @entity103 just off of @entity109 in @entity104 – an establishment that currently holds the distinction of being the longest continuously - running bar in the @entity113 he scrawled the title ’s manuscript on the backside of a bar menu			1
though @entity10 considered himself more of an illustrator and artist than a writer , he did have unique prophecies when it came to catering to his literary audience			0
he thought that children ’s books should possess a certain degree of intelligence and was once quoted as saying : ‘ we are writing for children , but not for idiots			0
’ the @entity133 native , born in 1898 , actually became a @entity113 citizen in 1918 and lived the majority of his adult life in @entity16 – where he died at the age of 64 in 1962			0
visitors to the city ’s famous @entity10 bar – located inside the @entity141 on the @entity142 – especially privy to the author ’s affinity for @entity16			2
defining points : while @entity1 and her schoolmates all dressed the same , the title character stood out for her fiery hair and feisty spirit fearless : @entity1 held a fearless spirit , and would help save her friends from trouble ( pictured , a drawing from @entity106 , c. 1956 ) the bar is blanketed in @entity10 sketches ( @entity1 included ) – from the wallpaper to the tiny lamps adorning each cocktail table ( two of which are on display at the @entity6 ) – because of an exchange the illustrator bartered in return for a year and a half worth ’s free stay in the historic hotel			1
@entity141 associates were so pleased with @entity10 work that they also named the bar after him			2
@entity10 enjoyed success as a privately - commissioned illustrator - proof of which is also on display			0
among these relics are two remarkable panels that @entity10 created for the walls of a playroom inside @entity179 ’s yacht @entity180 ( commissioned in 1953 )			0
additional works also on display include the many cartoons that @entity10 created for magazines including @entity185 , @entity186 , and @entity187			0
