by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:14 pm on 7th october 2011 the @entity3 drones used to kill @entity4 and other @entity6 chiefs have been infected by a computer virus that logs their every move , it has been claimed			1
the unmanned @entity11 , which killed the @entity3 attack planner , and the @entity14 crafts are still able to complete missions over @entity16 , @entity17 and other warzones			1
but each keystroke made by pilots , who operate the drones remotely from a base in @entity23 , is said to be recorded by the virus and experts are struggling to remove it			1
predator : the craft , which killed @entity6 boss @entity29 , is said to be one of two drones infected by the virus specialists think the infection has hit both classified and unclassified machines at the base			1
this means that some of the data captured by the virus may have been transmitted to the internet and could be available to terrorists online			1
in recent years the @entity3 military has increasingly relied on drones , which were first used in the mid- 1990s			2
although , each drone cost between $ 10million for a predator and $ 30million for a @entity14 , they are highly valued because they do not risk the lives of @entity3 servicemen			1
their use , particularly in remote areas of @entity17 , @entity52 and @entity16 has risen amid the increasing military death toll			0
given the controversial nature of missions in sovereign countries , which have not approved @entity3 operations , drones are seen as the best way of carrying out such missions			2
last month , a predator drone scored its most high - profile victim yet , killing @entity4 and other @entity6 operatives in a convoy in @entity16			2
since president @entity65 assumed office , a fleet of approximately 30 @entity69 - directed drones have hit targets in @entity52 more than 230 times			1
they are understood to have killed more than 2,000 suspected terrorists and civilians			1
more than 150 additional craft , under @entity3 @entity77 control , watch over the fighting in @entity17 and @entity79			0
@entity3 military drones struck 92 in @entity81 between mid-april and late august , when dictator @entity82 was ousted from power after 42 years			2
none of the remote cockpits , in which pilots steer the craft using joysticks and monitors , are supposed to be connected to the public internet			1
but the so - called ‘ air gaps ’ between classified and public networks have reportedly been bridged in the past through the use of discs and removable drives			1
predator and @entity14 crews use removable hard drives to load map updates and transport mission videos from one computer to another			1
the virus is believed to have spread through these removable drives			1
drone units at other @entity77 bases worldwide have now been ordered to stop their use			2
in the meantime , technicians at @entity110 are trying to get the virus off the @entity113 machines			0
‘ we keep wiping it off , and it keeps coming back , ’ says a source familiar with the network infection told technology website @entity117			0
‘ we think it ’s benign			0
but we just do n’t know			0
’ however , security specialists at @entity110 are not sure whether the so - called ‘ keylogger ’ virus were introduced intentionally or by accident			1
they believe it may be a common piece of malware that just happened to make its way into these sensitive networks			0
the situation is serious enough that senior officers at @entity110 are being briefed daily on the virus			0
in recent years the @entity3 military has increasingly relied on drones , which were first used in the mid- 1990s in the former @entity135			0
although , each drone cost between $ 10million for a predator and $ 30million for a @entity14 , they are highly valued because they can search , spy and destroy without risking the lives of @entity3 servicemen			1
their use , particularly in remote , mountainous areas of @entity17 , @entity52 and @entity16 has risen amid the increasingly alarming death toll of airmen and soldiers			0
@entity149 : the drones are piloted in remote cockpits at @entity110 in @entity23 massive : @entity14 , another drone allegedly infected has a wingspan of 84ft and costs $ 30million last month , a predator drone scored its most high - profile victim yet , killing @entity4 and other @entity6 operatives in a convoy in @entity16 with hellfire missiles			1
given the controversial nature of missions in sovereign countries such as the @entity165 state and @entity52 , which have not approved @entity3 operations , drones are seen as the best way of carrying out such missions			0
wiped out : @entity4 is the most high - profile target killed by a drone since president @entity65 assumed office , a fleet of approximately 30 @entity69 - directed drones have hit targets in @entity52 more than 230 times			1
they are understood to have killed more than 2,000 suspected terrorists and civilians			2
more than 150 additional craft , under @entity3 @entity77 control , watch over the fighting in @entity17 and @entity79			0
@entity3 military drones struck 92 in @entity81 between mid-april and late august , when dictator @entity82 was ousted from power after 42 years			0
but despite their widespread use , the drone systems are known to have security flaws			2
notably , hours of footage was captured by @entity79 insurgents in 2009 using a $ 26 piece of software			0
the @entity77 declined to comment directly on the virus , when			0
‘ we generally do not discuss specific vulnerabilities , threats , or responses to our computer networks , since that helps people looking to exploit or attack our systems to refine their approach , ’ lieutenant @entity192 , a spokesman for @entity193 , told @entity194			0
‘ we invest a lot in protecting and monitoring our systems to counter threats and ensure security , which includes a comprehensive response to viruses , worms , and other malware we discover			2

predator and @entity14 drones ' hit by *mysterious* keylogger virus '
infection thought have spread via crews ' removable hard drives
fears tracking logs may be on public internet and available to terrorists
drone use has been *suspended* while security specialists *investigate*
experts at @entity23 base believe virus is most likely accidental malware
drones have killed more than 2,000 people since @entity65 was *elected*
