by @entity0 published : 19:11 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 19:11 est , 6 august 2013 more than 900 gp practices across the country use 0844 numbers despite official guidance from the @entity5 that they should not do so the @entity6 has been censured for promoting hundreds of 0844 telephone numbers without explaining that users can be hit with rip - off charges of up to 41p a minute			1
critics say charging people to access the @entity6 flies in the face of the principle that its medical services should be free at the point of delivery			1
however , hundreds of doctors of surgeries continue to use expensive 0844 numbers			2
and now the @entity21 website , which describes itself as the ‘ front door to the @entity6 ’ has been found guilty of promoting these expensive gp numbers without spelling out the cost involved			1
in a ruling published today , the @entity25 says the @entity6 is guilty of misleading the public by failing to list the charges			1
more than 900 gp practices across the country use 0844 numbers despite official guidance from the @entity5 and the @entity6 hierarchy that they should not do so			2
callers with a mobile can be charged up to 41p a minute to reach these numbers – more than double the figure for a normal geographic number beginning 01 or 02			2
many people dialling their local gp from a landline would get the call free under their call package , however dialling an 0844 number can generate a charge of 5p a minute plus a 13p set - up fee			0
some of the income from the calls goes direct to the @entity40 surgeries to subsidise the cost of their telephone systems			0
the @entity25 was first told about the failure of the @entity21 website to alert users to charges before @entity55			1
the @entity6 subsequently promised to make changes , however it failed to do so and is still running the misleading information			0
the ruling is a victory for a consumer campaigner who asked not to be named			0
he said : ‘ the main fault here lies with @entity40 surgeries who i believe are in breach of their contracts and official guidance			0
‘ it is totally unacceptable to charge people in this way			0
’ official backing : the @entity21 website , which describes itself as the ' front door to the @entity6 ' has been found guilty of promoting these expensive gp numbers without spelling out the cost involved in its ruling , the @entity25 said : ‘ we considered that the costs of calling the 0844 numbers should have been made clear on the website			1
' because these costs were not clearly stated we concluded that the website was misleading			0
we told @entity21 to include clear pricing information for the 0844 numbers			1
’ the @entity85 said doctors are reviewing the use of 0844 numbers and are likely to drop them when existing contracts with their telephone service providers come to an end .			0
