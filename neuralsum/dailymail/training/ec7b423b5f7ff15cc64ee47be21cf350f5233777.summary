at the 1982 @entity2 the only way @entity1 managed to stop @entity3 was to task their hard - nosed centre - back @entity7 with man - marking the diminutive star			0
@entity7 committed 23 fouls on @entity12 ’s @entity11 in @entity13 , as @entity1 triumphed 2 - 1 and left their opponents needing to beat @entity16 in their next match to advance - something they failed to do			2
thirty - two years later there were echoes of that famous hatchet job during @entity16 ’s match against @entity24 in @entity25 , as @entity26 thundered into @entity27 at every opportunity to disrupt the @entity30 ’s rhythm			1
the referee gave @entity24 a free - kick , buts somehow @entity26 avoided a booking			0
it has been suggested already during the tournament that the hosts have been getting more than their fair share of refereeing decision , and this was a clear example of leniency towards @entity16 trumping reason			0
appeals : @entity27 asks for a free - kick after clashing with @entity26 during the first half clattered : @entity27 lies on the floor after one of @entity26 's string of fouls late in the half : @entity26 charges through the back of @entity27 in the 46th minute upended : @entity27 is barged into the air by @entity26 during the first half of their @entity2 quarter - final ten minutes later @entity26 was at it again , clattering into @entity24 ’s @entity11 and getting none of the ball just inside the @entity16 half			1
the referee again spotted the foul , but again @entity26 was not shown a card to match his shirt			0
then , right on the brink of half - time , @entity27 was uprooted by @entity16 's midfielder enforcer for a third time			1
for a third time the referee turned a blind eye , as @entity26 trudged off at half - time with no booking to his name			1
the last foul was his 10th in @entity16 's two most recent games .			2

@entity16 midfielder committed a *horrible* foul on the @entity30 in 14th minute
somehow he was not shown a *yellow* card for the challenge
ten minutes later he fouled the *attacker* again but still was not booked
then on the brink of half - time he charged *straight* through @entity27
@entity26 has committed 10 fouls in @entity16 's last two matches
