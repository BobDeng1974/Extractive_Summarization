@entity1 boss @entity0 insists his team will not resort to diving and cheating in their battle against relegation			1
@entity0 says he has been shocked by the amount of simulation he has witnessed during @entity1 's first season back in the @entity10			1
he claims another manager has urged him to ' move with the times ' and instruct his players to seek out decisions			2
@entity0 is insistent that his @entity1 players wo n't ever dive or cheat to prosper under him but while @entity0 accepts his players are naive on such matters , he insists that is the way he likes it and will not be asking them to follow suit , regardless of their situation			1
@entity1 are second from bottom with just six games remaining but are only two points from a safe position and have earned many plaudits for their battling displays			1
@entity0 said : ' there is a certain way of playing			2
i believe the team play in the correct manner			1
there 's been minimal , if any , simulation from our players			2
i see it constantly in this league , more so than i ever thought i would			0
the @entity1 have established themselves as one of the hardest working teams in the @entity10 ' at this level we have been naive at times , in the right way			1
i think that 's sad that players just ca n't go out and play and get decisions that they should get			2
' one prominent manager i am not going to name said to me , ' you are being naive , you should get your players to move with the times '			1
it 's not my belief			0
you should play the game properly			0
' if someone touches you in the box and you go down , that 's always been there - that 's not cheating , that 's just gamesmanship			0
that 's part of the game			0
' i 'm on about absolute simulation where there is no contact and people go to the floor			0
' with relegation a real possibility , @entity1 are fighting for their lives at the bottom of the division @entity0 feels while football gets into a moral tangle over certain high - profile , one - off incidents , this issue of repeated cheating is all too often overlooked			1
in terms of policing it , he sympathises with referees and wants the system of retrospective punishment extended to cover blatant acts of simulation			0
he said : ' it would evaporate out of the game within two , three or four weeks because managers who have some amazing players will say , ' we ca n't be losing you for three games '			1
' i 'd like to know the reason it has n't been brought in , and if it is getting really looked at in depth			0
@entity0 was told by another manager to ' get with the times ' and that his team was too naive ' it 's only because i think morally we talk to our kids about fairness and playing the right way , and yet , in one of the most powerful leagues in the world , there are people dropping everywhere			1
' weirdly , you 'll open a debate about @entity115 , put him all over the papers saying he 's doing this , that and the other , but yet something that is there for all to see all of the time every week , is sort of accepted			0
@entity121 is n't it ? ' if that was my centre - half and someone is through and he pulls the shirt , he gets banned			2
it 's the same difference is n't it ? '			0
