warning : dr @entity0 , former head of the @entity1 , said that @entity2 should lose weight if he wants to run for president the former @entity1 doctor who @entity2 told to ' shut up ' after she criticized his weight said she also received an angry phone call from the @entity10 governor			1
@entity2 attacked @entity11 physician @entity0 during a press conference earlier in the week but the woman has revealed he called her and yelled at her over the phone			1
' it was essentially the tone of the press conference , only louder , ' she told @entity17			1
' it was hard to get anything across			2
' @entity20 said @entity2 's behaviour had made her consider withdrawing her support for the politician , who is a potential presidential candidate for 2016			1
' the way he acted lately i do n't think so			0
he was n't very nice to me , ' the doctor said			2
' politically , if this is the way ( he handles ) stress ... is this presidential ? i 'll have to think about that			2
is this a presidential way to behave ? c'mon			1
' @entity20 said she had received a barrage of harsh comments from @entity2 supporters after her remarks			1
' i 've gotten lots of hate mails , lots of threatening , mean stuff			0
my intention was n't to hurt anybody , ' she said			0
the woman , who was the @entity1 doctor for nine years , encompassing both @entity47 administrations and @entity49 's time as president , said she thought @entity2 may have gotten her mixed up			1
' i do n't think he realized who he was talking to , ' @entity20 told @entity17			1
she said that it was common for medical experts to give their opinions on the health concerns of potential presidential candidates			2
' i think i 'm qualified to make a comment , ' she added			0
the fierce row was sparked when @entity2 made a joke about his size on @entity63 , at one point whipping out a donut from his pocket to drive the self - deprecation home			1
' i â€™m worried about this man dying in office , ' @entity20 said in an interview with @entity89			2
' i can understand why his doctors and other people have had trouble getting him to lose weight			0
this is an issue that will haunt him if he decides to run for office , ' she said			2
she even said that she would like to see him go for the top job , but that did n't help to soften the blow			0
but @entity2 's backlash was harsh , claiming on wednesday that since dr @entity20 has n't given him a physical exam or heard anything about his family history , ' she should shut up '			1
' i find it fascinating that a doctor in @entity11 -- who 's never met me , never examined me , never reviewed my medical history or records and knows nothing about my family history -- could make a diagnosis from 2,400 miles away , ' he said			1
good taste : @entity77 has poked fun of @entity2 's weight in several late - night monologues and the @entity79 showed that he could take a joke , but he was n't as light hearted when it came to issues about a possible run on @entity77 's show , a good portion of their conversation was dedicated to the talk show host 's habit of making fun of the 50 - year - old governor 's girth			1
he joked , following a recent physical that showed his blood sugar and cholesterol levels to be in acceptable ranges : ' i 'm basically the healthiest fat guy you 've ever seen in your life			2
' that remark was off - putting for @entity20 , who responded in a live phone interview on @entity140 saying : ' i thought it was very sad that he made fun of that			1
' ' i 'm not a hack			0
if you look up my resume , i 've been in the @entity1 for nine years			0
i 'm a retired @entity147 rear admiral			0
i 'm board - certified in internal medicine			0
' she ended the interview abruptly as she said that the governor was calling her at that very moment			2
he admitted that his size was ' fair game ' for comedians , but he followed their night of laughs up with a more serious admission the next day			0
@entity2 told reporters on tuesday that even though he is ' remarkably healthy ' , his doctor ' continues to warn me that my luck is going to run out relatively soon			1
' tough talk : the @entity10 governor said that since dr @entity20 does n't know his family history and has never given him a physical ' she should shut up ' this is far from a new issue , as the questions began to arise about whether his weight would hinder a possible presidential run when he was suggested as a potential @entity79 candidate early on in the 2012 race			1
it came up again when he was thought to be a front - runner for @entity177 's running mate			0
he directly addressed the issue when he sat down with @entity178 in december after being selected as one of her ' most fascinating people ' of the year			0
she asked the governor and possible @entity79 presidential nominee if he agrees with the criticism that he is too fat to run for the position of commander in chief			1
' that 's ridiculous , i mean that 's ridiculous - i do n't know what the basis for that is , ' he said in the interview			0
one of the concerns often cited by his critics is that the 50 - year - old politician 's obesity increases the risk of health problems like possible type 2 diabetes , heart disease and certain types of cancers			0
' i 've done this job pretty well , and i think people have watched me for the last number of weeks with @entity208 doing 18 hour days and getting right back up the next day and still being just as effective in the job , so i do n't really think that would be a problem , ' he said in response .			0
