by @entity0 are you under the impression that @entity3 was the most dysfunctional monarch we 've ever had ? meeting our @entity6 kings of the 18th century might make you think again			1
we 'll be hearing a lot about them in 2014 , as our first @entity6 monarch @entity10 - distant forebear of today 's little @entity12 - ascended the throne exactly 300 years ago			1
@entity10 ascended the throne exactly 300 years ago exhibitions across @entity16 are celebrating this anniversary , including the first @entity18 : @entity19 1714 - 1760 at @entity20 , @entity21 , with over 300 @entity23 treasures from the @entity24			1
at @entity25 , where i am a curator , we 're covering the stories of @entity10 at @entity29 and @entity30 at @entity31			1
i 'll also be introducing @entity10 and @entity30 , @entity33 's least - known kings , in a new @entity35 4 series @entity36			1
it 's funny to think that our modern @entity39 monarchy originated in @entity40 , and that @entity10 , elector of @entity6 ( effectively a prince ) , was invited to become @entity42 of @entity33 through an accident of biology			1
in 1714 his distant cousin @entity45 died with no surviving children , despite having gone through 18 pregnancies trying to produce an heir			2
her nearest relatives were all @entity50 , and therefore unacceptable to @entity33 's powerful @entity52 ruling class			2
@entity30 ( left ) and his son @entity53 ( right ) who both were said to have volatile relationships with their family so @entity58 looked for @entity45 's nearest surviving @entity52 relatives and finally found them living in the sleepy little @entity40 state of @entity6			1
@entity40 @entity10 was then 54 years old , and was n't all that keen on coming over to @entity33 to start a new career as king			1
he was n't warmly welcomed by his new subjects either			2
one spectator at his @entity65 waved a turnip on a stick : the message was that @entity6 was a place full of yokels			1
his new subjects also believed he had brought with him no fewer than two mistresses - one fat , one thin - known as @entity73 and @entity74			2
' the king rejects no woman if she is very willing , very fat , and has great breasts , ' one courtier claimed			2
in reality , the king 's poor @entity79 was at the root of the misunderstanding			2
the @entity73 was really his half - sister and he lived with his single , skinny , almost respectable mistress of more than 20 years @entity85 , with whom he had three illegitimate daughters			1
but there was a fiery sexual scandal in @entity42 's past			2
in the 1690s , his wife , @entity90 of @entity91 , had embarked upon an affair with a @entity94 count while @entity30 consorted with @entity85			2
@entity95 ( pictured ) tried to carry out a coup and become king in his father 's place their love letters were leaked and @entity30 was humiliated throughout @entity101			0
rumour has it he had the lover assassinated , and it 's absolutely certain he divorced his wife for adultery , placing her under house arrest in a remote @entity40 castle for the rest of her life			0
at the time @entity10 locked up his wife , their son , the future @entity30 , was only 11			1
he would never see his mother again			0
this was one factor in the appallingly bad relationship that developed between these two			0
@entity30 i was quiet and shy , whereas @entity30 was volatile and passionate			0
@entity10 had hated his wife , while @entity30 loved his own deeply			1
the parties @entity10 held at @entity31 were rivalled by the exciting @entity123 © es hosted elsewhere by his son			1
at the @entity95 's parties , people were said to have had so much fun ' some virgins conceived '			0
this bad feeling came to a head in the ludicrous events of 1717 , known as ' @entity132 '			0
when the @entity95 and his wife @entity135 had their fifth child , the baby 's christening was interrupted by a gate - crasher , the @entity139 , who 'd been sent by the king to be a spy in his son 's camp			0
' you rascal ! ' the @entity95 said to the @entity139 , ' i will find you later ! ' unfortunately , because all the @entity148 spoke @entity79 with a thick @entity40 accent , what the courtier heard was , ' you rascal ! i will fight you ! ' he took this as an invitation to a duel - a dreadful breach of court etiquette - and complained to the king , who , believing the worst , expelled his son and princess @entity135 from the royal palaces			0
he also kept behind four of his grandchildren as hostages for future good behaviour from their father the @entity95			0
poor princess @entity135 ' fell into one faint after another ' as she said goodbye to her weeping children			0
worse still , the new baby boy , whose christening had ignited the quarrel , was given poor medical care , and died			0
accounts in the @entity174 record payment for a little square of black velvet , the size of a child 's coffin			0
this quarrel dangerously tarnished the image of the new @entity182			0
and yet the alternative was seen as even worse			0
few people wanted the @entity185 claimants to the throne back again : the @entity188 @entity187 , and then his son , the @entity190 @entity190			1
slowly but surely , with growing confidence , kings @entity10 and then @entity30 settled into their new realm , providing steady government , and crushing two rebellions by their exiled rivals			1
historian , dr @entity0 , will present @entity36 starting on thursday , 9pm on @entity198 @entity10 's great - grandson , @entity53 , completed the process of transplantation when he came to the throne in 1760			1
' i was born and educated in this country , ' he proudly declared , ' i glory in the name of @entity33			0
' a kind and welcoming man , he came to the throne resolved ' to introduce a new custom ' : that all his ' family should live well together ' , because he was ' very sorry for the misunderstandings that there had formerly been '			1
he proceeded to act on this by marrying a @entity40 princess , @entity216 , remaining uxoriously devoted to her and fathering 15 children			0
yet one thing remained the same			0
as the years rolled by , even the friendly @entity53 came to have a terrible relationship with his own eldest son , the future @entity95 when the king began to suffer from debilitating bouts of a mysterious illness , possibly porphyria , or maybe bipolar disorder , his son tried to carry out a coup and become king in his father 's place			2
today , many people have difficulty identifying the four @entity23 monarchs , thinking them grumpy , @entity40 and indistinguishable			2
but in reality they were human beings , experiencing pain and passion just as the rest of us do			0
this year 's exhibitions and programmes about the @entity6 kings will hopefully bring them back to vivid life			1
the @entity18 , thursday , 9pm , @entity198			1
the first @entity18 : @entity243 is showing at @entity20 until 12 october .			0

a new series will *explore* the lives of @entity39 @entity6 monarchs
it marks the 300 years since @entity10 ascended the throne
