by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 21:03 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : 05:25 est , 24 december 2013 a robot developed by a @entity6 start - up that was recently acquired by @entity7 has left 15 rivals for dead at a two - day competition hosted by the @entity10 to see which machine could cope best in the event of a nuclear meltdown			1
@entity15 's machine carried out all eight rescue - themed tasks - including scaling a ladder , opening a door , removing debris and clearing debris - to outscore its rivals by a mechanical mile , taking 27 of a possible 32 points			1
however @entity26 's entry @entity24 , a $ 3 million creation , failed to score a single point , in an embarrassing blow to the @entity31 space station			2
the machine was seemingly designed to much in an astronaut sense , weighing a clunky 125kg , rather than being to help out in a crisis			0
@entity38 ' s closest competitor was @entity39 - which used the @entity7 / @entity41 robot - which cored 20 points , the @entity36 reports			2
three of the other 15 teams that took part failed to secure any points at the event near @entity48 , @entity49 , with @entity26 one of them			2
' anything you can do , humans ! ' : @entity6 robot @entity38 completes one of the eight @entity57 challenges - climbing a steep ladder embarassing : the robot created by @entity26 ( pictured ) failed to complete any of the eight tasks it was assigned during the two - day @entity57 competition clean - up : another task required clearing debris from an entry way			1
@entity57 said the motivated to do the competition are realizing how little robots were able to help during the @entity70 nuclear meltdown four countries took place in the competition - @entity31 , @entity6 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
@entity75 said it had been inspired to organise the challenge after it became clear robots were only capable of playing a very limited role in efforts to contain 2011 's @entity70 nuclear reactor meltdown in @entity6			1
' what we realised was ... these robots could n't do anything other than observe , ' said @entity87 , programme manager for the @entity88			0
' what they needed was a robot to go into that reactor building and shut off the valves			0
' in order to spur on development of more adept robots the agency challenged contestants to complete a series of tasks , with a time - limit of 30 minutes for each			2
among the challenges were driving a utility vehicle along a course , climb an 8ft - high ladder , remove debris blocking a doorwar and cut a triangular shape in a wall using a cordless drill			0
more than 100 teams originally applied to take part , and the number was whittled down to 17 by @entity75 ahead of friday and saturday 's event			1
@entity38 is also capable of opening a door			0
the two - legged humanoid out - mastered rivals by seven points @entity120 fail : in a demonstration video , @entity26 said they were ' thinking about the competition the entire time ' while making @entity24 , which cost $ 3 million			1
maybe they should have been thinking about it actually working ? some entered their own machines , while others made use of @entity128 - a robot manufactured by another @entity7 - owned business , @entity41 - controlling it with their own software			0
one self - funded team from @entity74 - @entity133 - dropped out at the last moment , bringing the number of contestants who took part at the @entity138 racetrack to 16			0
@entity38 's 1.48m ( 4ft 11in ) tall , two - legged robot entered the contest the favourite and lived up to its reputation			1
it makes use of a new high - voltage liquid - cooled motor technology that uses a capacitor , rather a battery , for power			0
its engineers say this lets its arms move and pivot at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible , in effect giving it stronger " muscles "			0
@entity159 's @entity158 the robots had to attach a hose pipe as one of their challenges the machine was developed by a spin - off from the @entity168 's @entity167 lab , which @entity7 recently revealed it had acquired			0
in case of an emergency , @entity38 unhooks a fire hose @entity172 attempts the ladder challenge during the event in @entity49 the team scored 27 points out of a possible 32 , putting it seven points ahead of second - placed @entity39 , which used @entity128			1
scores were based on a system that awarded three points for completing a task 's primary objectives , and then a bonus point for doing so without any human intervention			0
@entity38 's robot behaved almost perfectly , but lost points because ' the wind blew a door out of their robot 's hold and because their robotic creation was not able to climb out of a vehicle after it successfully navigated an obstacle course , ' reported the @entity197			2
four countries took part in the @entity57 competition , including @entity31 , @entity73 , @entity74 and of course @entity6			1

@entity75 ( @entity57 ) *decided* to host a competition that would test the world 's *greatest* robotic technology
the eight - part ' rescue challenge ' was inspired by the nuclear meltdown at @entity209 during the 2011 @entity6 *tsunami* , where it was realized robots could do very little to help
*coincidentally* @entity6 won the competition , with its two - legged humanoid ' @entity38 ' completing all tasks and scoring 27 out of a possible 32
three teams scored zero , one of them being @entity26
