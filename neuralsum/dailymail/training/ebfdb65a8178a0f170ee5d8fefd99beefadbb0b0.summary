it is the most iconic image ever taken by @entity2 's @entity1			1
taken in 1995 , is revealed never - before - seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young , massive stars in a small region of the @entity10 , or @entity10			1
now , the space telescope has revisited the three pillar - and taken these stunning new images			0
it also reveals the base of the cold , gassy columns for the first time			2
released today during the @entity26 's annual winter meeting , the new @entity1 photo is sharper than the original , and also has a wider field of view			1
it also reveals the base of the cold , gassy columns for the first time			2
astronomers also asked the telescope to shoot the same region in both visible and infrared light			1
the infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie , wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars			1
that 's because the infrared light penetrates much of the gas and dust , except for the densest regions of the pillars			1
newborn stars can be seen hidden away inside the pillars			0
' though such butte - like features are common in star - forming regions , the @entity10 structures are by far the most photogenic and evocative , ' researchers said			2
the original @entity1 image is so popular that it has appeared in movies and television shows , on tee - shirts and pillows , and even on a postage stamp			1
in celebration of its 25th anniversary , @entity1 has revisited the famous pillars , providing astronomers with a sharper and wider view			1
the infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie , wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars			2
taken in 1995 , @entity1 's original image revealed never - before - seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young , massive stars in a small region of the @entity10 , or @entity10			1
although the original image was dubbed the @entity74 , the new image hints that they are also pillars of destruction			1
' i 'm impressed by how transitory these structures are			0
they are actively being ablated away before our very eyes			0
the ghostly bluish haze around the dense edges of the pillars is material getting heated up and evaporating away into space			0
' we have caught these pillars at a very unique and short - lived moment in their evolution , ' explained @entity91 of @entity92 in @entity93 , who , with astronomer @entity94 , formerly of @entity92 , led the original @entity1 observations of the @entity10			1
the infrared image shows that the reason the pillars exist is because the very ends of them are dense , and they shadow the gas below them , creating the long , pillar - like structures			2
the gas in between the pillars has long since been blown away by the ionizing winds from the central star cluster located above the pillars			2
at the top edge of the left - hand pillar , a gaseous fragment has been heated up and is flying away from the structure , underscoring the violent nature of star - forming regions			0
' these pillars represent a very dynamic , active process , ' @entity91 said			0
' the gas is not being passively heated up and gently wafting away into space			0
' the gaseous pillars are actually getting ionized ( a process by which electrons are stripped off of atoms ) and heated up by radiation from the massive stars			1
' and then they are being eroded by the stars ' strong winds ( barrage of charged particles ) , which are sandblasting away the tops of these pillars			0
' when @entity91 and @entity133 used @entity1 to make the initial observations of the @entity10 in 1995 , astronomers had seen the pillar - like structures in ground - based images , but not in detail			1
they knew that the physical processes are not unique to the @entity10 because star birth takes place across the universe			2
but at a distance of just 6,500 light - years , @entity10 is the most dramatic nearby example , as the team soon realized			2
by comparing the 1995 and 2014 pictures , astronomers also noticed a lengthening of a narrow jet - like feature that may have been ejected from a newly forming star			0
as @entity91 of @entity152 piecing together the @entity153 , he was amazed at what he saw			0
' i called @entity94 on his phone and said , ' you need to get here now , '' @entity91 recalled			0
' we laid the pictures out on the table , and we were just gushing because of all the incredible detail that we were seeing for the very first time			0
' the first features that jumped out at the team in 1995 were the streamers of gas seemingly floating away from the columns			2
astronomers had previously debated what effect nearby massive stars would have on the surrounding gas in stellar nurseries			1
' there is only one thing that can light up a neighborhood like this : massive stars kicking out enough horsepower in ultraviolet light to ionize the gas clouds and make them glow , ' @entity91 said			1
' nebulous star - forming regions like @entity10 are the interstellar neon signs that say , ' we just made a bunch of massive stars here			1
' this was the first time we had directly seen observational evidence that the erosionary process , not only the radiation but the mechanical stripping away of the gas from the columns , was actually being seen			0
' the jet looks like a stream of water from a garden hose			0
over the intervening 19 years , this jet has stretched farther into space , across an additional 60 billion miles , at an estimated speed of about 450,000 miles per hour			0
our @entity201 probably formed in a similar turbulent star - forming region			0
there is evidence that the forming solar system was seasoned with radioactive shrapnel from a nearby supernova			0
that means that our @entity201 was formed as part of a cluster that included stars massive enough to produce powerful ionizing radiation , such as is seen in the @entity10			1
' that 's the only way the nebula from which the @entity201 was born could have been exposed to a supernova that quickly , in the short period of time that represents , because supernovae only come from massive stars , and those stars only live a few tens of millions of years , ' @entity91 explained			1
' what that means is when you look at the environment of the @entity10 or other star - forming regions , you 're looking at exactly the kind of nascent environment that our @entity201 formed in			0

original image was taken in 1995 showing three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young , massive stars in a small region of the @entity10 , or @entity10
the new @entity1 photo is sharper than the original , and also has a wider field of view
astronomers also asked the telescope to shoot the same region in both visible and infrared light .
