@entity0 needed just two goals to reach a career total of 400 , but instead he provided two brilliant assists , with @entity4 the beneficiary both times as @entity9 ’s @entity8 duo put @entity10 to the sword			1
the final member of what will become @entity9 ’s fearsome attacking trio , @entity14 , watched on from the sidelines as he continues to serve his suspension , with breakthrough star @entity17 starting for the third consecutive game instead , putting in a lively display			1
@entity21 opted to leave centre - back @entity22 on the bench , instead pairing @entity25 , back from suspension , with @entity27 , back from injury			1
@entity4 , meanwhile , also began among the substitutes after his midweek exertions for @entity31			2
subs : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58			0
goal : @entity4 80 , 84			2
@entity10 : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 64 ) , @entity68 , @entity69 ( @entity70 64 ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 83 ) , @entity73 , @entity74			2
subs : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79			0
attendance : 80,081 @entity21 scored a hat - trick against @entity10 in a 7 - 0 win at the @entity38 back in the 2000 - 01 season , but @entity9 are still finding their rhythm under the @entity87 and we may have wait a while to see a similar demolition			1
the match started at a high tempo , with @entity46 being forced to swipe away a cross from the left after a smart @entity68 interception started the move			0
but @entity9 responded well , with @entity17 firing wide of the top left corner shortly afterwards , before @entity52 had an effort from close range well saved by @entity61			1
@entity9 fans sang for independence after 17 minutes and 14 seconds , as they usually do			2
it had more meaning today , shortly after @entity105 ’s national day , with a special canvas draped down one stand of @entity38 as a nod to it			0
the teams were both wearing ‘ nationalist ’ kits , with @entity9 ’s red and yellow striped ‘ senyera ’ shirt representing the @entity116 flag , while @entity10 sported green , white and red , the colours of the @entity121 ’s @entity120 flag			1
@entity17 had another great chance around 20 minutes in , lashing over the bar from the edge of the box , when he should have hit the target			2
and after 40 minutes he could have had a free run at goal , but his first touch was poor			0
instead he rolled the ball to @entity0 , whose shot was blocked			2
in between the two @entity9 chances there were two strong penalty claims for @entity9			1
the first saw @entity17 barged into from behind by the goalkeeper @entity61			2
the ball fell to @entity0 on the edge of the box , but instead of giving a penalty or waving play on , referee @entity81 gave @entity10 a free kick			1
the second saw veteran defender @entity63 shove @entity17 to the ground and then tumble over himself			0
again , @entity81 saw no infringement			0
a couple of minutes before the interval a cross from the left came all the way though the box and @entity50 thumped it at goal , but @entity61 was equal to it			0
he was on hand again to deny @entity17 smartly from almost underneath the crossbar , before the teams went in goalless			2
@entity9 's talisman @entity0 is challenged by @entity159 's @entity158 defender @entity64 during their league match at the @entity38 @entity10 and @entity9 players walk out on to the pitch as pro-independence supporters hold up letters which spell out ' we will be free ' new @entity9 signing @entity50 slides in on @entity10 's @entity65 at the @entity38 @entity25 was hooked at half - time after taking a boot to the head from @entity10 striker @entity74 mid-way through the first half			1
the forward was deservedly booked for his high foot misdemeanour			0
@entity9 came out from the break like they meant business and within a few minutes had the ball in the back of the net			0
@entity178 cut the ball across from the left as @entity17 burst into the box and fired home , but it was ruled out for offside			0
@entity17 was behind @entity48 when he played the ball , so it was the wrong decision			0
the suspended @entity14 was watching on from the stands and would have relished some of the opportunities that @entity189 passed up			0
@entity21 decided enough was enough , and brought on @entity4 for the youngster			1
@entity192 's latest talent , @entity17 has made his debuts for @entity194 , @entity9 and @entity195 under 19 and 21 , and @entity195 in 2014 athletic midfielder @entity68 dribbles with the ball as @entity9 pair @entity25 and @entity47 close him down three - time @entity197 winner @entity0 heads the bull under pressure from @entity10 defenders at the @entity38 the @entity35 almost had an instant impact , but was chopped down on the edge of the box			1
then he lashed wide from 25 yards and would have been set for an easy tap - in , but for a rare misjudged ball by @entity51			0
@entity4 recovered the loose ball and tried to find @entity0 , but the excellent @entity64 cut it out			1
excellent that is , until his poor pass straight to @entity59 , which the midfielder fed to @entity0			0
the @entity40 looked up and split @entity10 ’s defence , leaving @entity4 just to stroke it past @entity61			1
@entity10 had n’t been able to muster much going forward , but @entity73 ’s splendid dribble left @entity22 in a tangle , but the defender recovered his balance to deny the tricky forward			0
it was all they could offer , before @entity9 ’s @entity8 combined again to put the game out of reach			0
a typically brilliant solo dribble by @entity0 took him into the box , before the @entity40 flicked the ball back to @entity4			1
the @entity35 took a touch to steady himself , then another to plant the ball in the bottom right corner and settle the game			0
while there is still more to come from @entity21 ’s @entity9 side , in terms of fluidity and attacking edge , he will be delighted with his 100 per cent record so far			1
and the clean sheet is their third from three @entity237 games this season , matching a record they last achieved in 1993 – when their third game was also against @entity10			1
@entity10 goalkeeper @entity242 organises his defenders as hosts @entity9 prepare to take a corner if @entity247 had featured against @entity10 it would have been his 300th game for @entity9 but , due to a knee proble for the @entity35 , @entity47 played instead young prospect @entity17 had a host of chances against @entity10 , as well as a couple of penalty appeals , but was eventually substituted for @entity4 @entity9 and @entity253 forward @entity0 finds himself in a familiar position , surrounded by opposition players			1

@entity9 beat @entity10 2 - 0
knee injury prevented @entity247 from making his 300th *appearance* for @entity9
@entity17 started for @entity9 but missed a host of chances
@entity4 came on as a substitute and scored a brace to hand @entity21 's side victory
@entity0 set up both of @entity4 's goals
@entity271 keeps @entity9 top of @entity237
