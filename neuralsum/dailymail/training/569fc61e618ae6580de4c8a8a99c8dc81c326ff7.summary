by @entity0 and @entity1 anger : @entity3 was given a police caution even though he was the victim of a crime carried out by a vandal on his business a businessman whose office was vandalised was arrested and hauled through the courts after he put up a poster branding the prime suspect a ‘ dirty pervert drug dealing grass ’			1
@entity3 , 44 , was infuriated when police told him no one would be prosecuted for smashing his office window with a brick			1
the name of the suspected culprit was handed to police but they said they could not press charges because of a lack of evidence			1
so company director mr @entity3 put a large sign over the boarded - up window , which expressed his view of the suspect without naming him			1
he was astonished when police said the suspect had complained about the sign and warned him he could face arrest for public order offences for causing ‘ distress and alarm ’			1
so then he taped over the word ‘ pervert ’ and added a disclaimer apologising for any distress to the public			2
but police were not satisfied and mr @entity3 was arrested and later charged with using threatening , abusive or insulting words – behaviour likely to cause harassment , alarm and distress			1
the father of two then faced two months of legal wrangling over the case in the courts – and a £ 1,000 legal bill – before finally agreeing to a police caution			1
last night mr @entity3 , from @entity45 , @entity46 , who has run a successful accident management and car hire firm for 12 years , condemned police and courts for failing to side with victims of crime			1
he said he was appalled that the vandal , who caused £ 2,500 worth of damage , will face no punishment			2
and he claimed he put up the sign only after he had been repeatedly goaded by the individual he suspected of committing the crime in the first place			2
he said : ‘ i was treated like a common criminal and yet i was supposed to be the victim of crime			0
‘ why did i have to go through the courts for two months ? there was no name on the sign , so how could it cause any distress ? ‘ one complaint was made about the sign by a named person and two were anonymous			0
' the first complaint made was by the man who i believe broke the window			0
my solicitor asked the police why he was n’t arrested when he made his complaint yet they said they could n’t prove anything as he had made no admissions			2
‘ what i ca n’t understand is why anyone would be angry about that sign unless they knew it was referring to them			0
' offensive ' : the person suspected of vandalising mr @entity3 's office subsequently complained to police after he put up this sign over the broken window ‘ i never intended to offend anyone – if anything this was a joke at the expense of the vandal , and he was n’t even named			1
‘ but i was arrested at my home in front of my wife by three detectives			0
it seems totally over the top			0
’ he added : ‘ first and foremost , i would like to apologise if we caused any offence – because it was never our intention to do this			0
' we wanted people to know that i was a victim of a crime and that the office had not shut down			0
‘ we are hard - working people and i would n’t wish this on anybody			0
‘ what i really want is for the vandal to be arrested for the criminal damage			2
i just want justice to be done			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity116 said that the evidence was thoroughly reviewed by a senior prosecutor and discussed with @entity119 before mr @entity3 was handed a caution .			1

@entity3 , 44 , had his office in @entity46 targeted by a vandal
after police said they did not have enough evidence to arrest the suspect , businessman put up sign calling him ' a dirty pervert '
but @entity3 was arrested because the suspect complained he was offended
