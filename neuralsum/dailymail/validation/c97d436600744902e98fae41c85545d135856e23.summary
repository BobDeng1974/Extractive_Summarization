the @entity6 mayor accused his @entity95 leadership rival of giving the ' benefit of the doubt ' to terror suspects like @entity99			2

mayor of london @entity88 ( pictured right ) lashed out at home secretary @entity89 on friday for ' watering down ' strict anti-terror powers which may have helped @entity10 escape the net and travel to @entity92 it is understood that three members of @entity48 's network were made subject in 2011 to control orders brought in by the last @entity126 government , which meant they had to live outside @entity6			2

two of the men on these weakened orders – known only as @entity137 and @entity138 in the court documents – aided with money , a false identity and bogus travel documents by the @entity6 jihadi cell			1

the mayor of @entity6 said : ' we need to keep a very , very close eye on these people			0
' the decision to modify the control orders , to water them down i think in retrospect looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able , when you are controlling these people to be able to relocate them , to take them away from their support networks and look after them , to monitor them properly			0
' we are now back on the right track and it just confirms to me the vital importance of us being able to monitor these people , to keep tabs on them , to look at what they are saying to each other in their email , their electronic contact			0
' this whole thing needs to be tackled very , very robustly			0
' we need to have a very strong security response that gives our people , gives our security services and the police the surveillance powers that they need			0
