this time , the blaze engulfed the entire building in just an hour — roaring from one end of the huge warehouse to the other , sounding like a series of explosions at times — and kept fire crews busy for nearly the whole weekend			2
even on monday morning , firefighters were still dumping water on the structure from an aerial truck as flare - ups continued to show up here and then			1
they also kept trees nearby wet so the flames would n't spread			0
authorities say the 119 - year - old structure 's wooden frames and beams caused the fire to engulf the building as quickly as it did the warehouse had already caught on fire several times before , but never with such intensity batallion chief @entity44 told the @entity9 that his crews are yet to enter the building for fear it might collapse			1
