by @entity0 published : 16:25 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 04:49 est , 9 september 2013 a fan who caused outrage by appearing to taunt an alleged sexual assault victim on live television saturday has explained his actions			1
a sign held up by a @entity8 student behind the hosts of @entity12 ’s @entity11 pregame show that said ‘ hi @entity17 ’ sparked outrage and appeared to taunt a girl who accused a @entity15 football player of sexual assaulting her aug 31 , 2010 only to have the allegations appear to have been ignored every step of the way			1
ms @entity17 , 19 , was a freshman at @entity21 , a small women ’s only @entity22 college literally across the street from the mighty @entity25			1
i did it : the person who held up the ' hi @entity17 ' sign wrote a letter to @entity31 detailing his reasons behind the offensive gesture unable to live with the aftermath of the alleged sexual assault and @entity25 ’s refusal to even acknowledge her repeated attempts to engage the school in any manner , ms @entity17 was found dead nine days later – the devout @entity22 had overdosed on antidepressants prescribed to treat her anxiety and depression			1
the name of the player was never made public and the prestigious @entity47 appeared to have swept the whole thing under the rug , until addressing it earlier this year			2
having seemingly dissipated into the ether of time , @entity17 ’s name , and alleged plight , were n’t on the minds of many people saturday morning until a sign saying ‘ hi @entity17 ’ appeared behind @entity11 co-host @entity58 while discussing the @entity25 - @entity8 game being played later that day on @entity8 ’s campus			1
mr @entity58 won the 1991 @entity61 as college football ’s greatest player for that season while at the @entity8			1
he did not react on - air to the sign , nor did anyone from @entity12			0
she loved country music : pictured here at a @entity70 concert , @entity17 was buried in this hat after her suicide , according to reports reaction online to the sign was fast and furious , no one appeared to appreciate the apparent jab at a young girl who killed herself after allegedly being sexually assaulted			1
‘ just " hi @entity17			2
how does espn let that get on tv			0
’ ( sic ) tweeted @ @entity82			0
‘ why the hell would someone come to @ @entity87 with a " hi @entity89 " sign ? ? ! ? @entity84 # @entity83 , ’ ( sic ) tweeted @ skrayyy			0
the knee - jerk reaction ‘ you stay classy , @entity8 , ' was also tweeted			2
realizing his ‘ statement ’ was taken in a way he had n’t intended , the student who held up the sign emailed @entity31 with an explanation			2
calling the entire ordeal ‘ unacceptable , ’ the letter ’s author writes that it ’s ‘ not just unacceptable in the eyes of college football fans , or whatever , but unacceptable in the eyes of society			2
@entity25 is better than this			2
we , as a people , are better than this			0
’ referencing the open secret that is not ‘ just a systemic culture of sexual assault that puts @entity25 in a bad light			1
it 's also the culture of dismissal and denial that pervades this university			0
’ ‘ @entity25 , since day one , has spent a lot of time covering this up			2
from the non-statements of a priest , to the anger of president @entity122 , @entity25 has n't officially said anything , ’ he further wrote			2
the letter writer , now hitting his stride , notes the texts that ms @entity128 received from a friend after telling of the alleged assault			2
a devout catholic : ms @entity17 was saving herself for marriage and said the football player 's alleged demands for a lap dance left her uncomfortable and that she ' did n't know what to do ' ‘ do n't do anything you would regret , ’ and @entity139 with notre dame football is a bad idea			1
’ ( sic ) ‘ in short , [ the sign ] was done to show that she is n't forgotten , and that people do know and care about her story			0
even if her school refuses to acknowledge it , there are some people out there who do , ’ he wrote in the letter			0
with this being the last time @entity25 will likely ever play at the @entity8 ’s ‘ @entity155 , ’ the student decided saturday was the time to make his point			1
‘ we , at @entity8 , will never have a chance to say anything to this disgraceful farce of a university again , after today			2
because that is the right thing to do , ’ he wrote			0
‘ everyone is important , @entity25			0
everyone has value , @entity25			0
you do n't treat a victim this way , or her family this way , @entity25			0
and if you do n't , you will be called out on it , ’ he later added			0
the student then urges people to donate to a mission set up by ms @entity17 ’s family in her honor , as a way to remember the endless charity work she did to help @entity179 ’s poor and less fortunate , or to her school ’s legacy fund in her name – and says he donated $ 25 , ‘ the cost of a @entity8 / @entity25 gameday t - shirt			1
’ ms @entity17 ’s story took months to be made public after she accused a @entity25 football player of the sexual assault			1
the allegations were detailed in a police report obtained by @entity190			0
the aggressor : @entity25 officials tried to paint her as the aggressor , saying her actions were those of a woman scorned ‘ he started sucking my neck and i started crying harder , ’ ms @entity17 wrote in the report , according to @entity190			1
‘ he pulled down my tank top by the straps			0
he slipped them down my shoulders and proceeded to suck and lick my right breast while holding me down on his lap by the arms , ' she continued			0
' i felt his hands start to move down towards my shorts as if he was trying to unbutton them or pull them off			0
i was still crying at this point and felt so scared that i could n't move , ’ the report further said			0
the prosecutor declined to bring charges in the case after ms @entity17 killed herself , which , @entity190 points out , is fairly common in the instance of an accuser taking their own life if they are the only witness to the alleged crime			1
ms @entity17 , according to the @entity190 report , was ‘ both politically and personally conservative , a brand new member of the @entity229 who led her parish youth group and spoke openly about saving herself for marriage			1
’ @entity25 officials moved quickly to portray her as a woman scorned , an ‘ aggressive young woman who lied to get back at him for sexually rejecting her the first moment they were ever alone together , ’ @entity190 reported			0
the alleged attacker had a history of misbehaviour and a reputation as a hot head , he was even suspended from high school for misbehaviour , said @entity190			0
several inconsistencies in the stories told by those involved muddled the truth , or maybe there were separate truths – each based on perception			0
whatever the case , the prosecutor never pressed charges , the player was never named and moved on with his life - @entity17 ended her 's			1
no punishment : the still unnamed player involved did not miss a single game , and even played in january 's @entity262 for @entity25 's @entity263 ( in blue and gold ) where ms @entity17 wrote that she felt ‘ uncomfortable ’ as she was pulled closer to her attacker while dancing in his room with others present and forced to do a lap dance , the others told investigators that ‘ she was being rather forward and dancing with the young man ; she was dancing for him			1
’ ‘ he told me to give him a lap dance and i did n't know what to do , ’ ms @entity128 wrote in the report			0
@entity25 officials refused to comment on the allegations when confronted by @entity190 reporter @entity277			1
the same day the @entity279 made ms @entity17 ’s allegations and subsequent suicide public – almost three months after the fact – @entity25 football coach joked during a media conference call ‘ that he did n't know the @entity279 could afford all the reporters who were peppering him with questions about the case , ’ according to @entity190			1
coach @entity290 did not even suspend the player in question while the accusations were looked into , he played in every game , and was part of every single practice			1
the school addressed the allegations in january 2013 , admitting to @entity299 that it ‘ could have acted a bit more quickly , ’ but instead of apologizing for failing to even acknowledge the allegations for more than two years , the school spokesperson took the opportunity to point out that ms @entity17 was not raped , ‘ in fact , it was an allegation of touching above the waist			1
’ not acceptable : the letter writer wrote that the many accusations of sexual abuse on campus are unacceptable and that someone had ' to stand up for what is right ' ms @entity17 ’s case is n’t the first one of females accusing @entity25 football players of sexual assault , rape or other improprieties			1
one girl accused a member of the team of raping her in february 2011 , the girl who drove her to the hospital after the attack claims she too was raped by a football player , @entity190 reported			1
that girl was also urged to keep quiet in text messages sent by other players , her parents told @entity190			0
when told of the allegations , school administrators told the shocked parents they ’d get the players to ‘ knock it off , ’ according to @entity190			0
those are only a few of the numerous alleged attacks by @entity25 football players , all of which can be easily found online – they are widely reported			2
this is why the sign holder attempted to bring attention to what he feels is a grave injustice			1
‘ @entity25 is , among other things , chicken for not having the spine to even say anything to the family of a girl while they have her blood on their hands , ’ the sign holder wrote in his letter to @entity31			2
@entity25 officials were not able to be reached by @entity358 for comment .			0

despite *widespread* outrage , he claims the sign was meant to bring attention to her case , and that of others whose accusations of sexual assault at the @entity15 have been ignored or covered up
@entity17 , 19 , was a freshman at a small @entity22 college across the street from @entity25
ms @entity17 had a history of anxiety and depression , and overdosed on her prescribed medication to kill herself
@entity25 administration refused for over two years to even acknowledge the accusations , outside of a joke made by football coach @entity290
the football player accused of the assault was never suspended , never missed a game and was allowed to attend all practices
the trip was @entity25 's last to @entity8 , the student felt the need to ' stand up for what 's right '
