by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 06:12 est , 15 november 2013 dozens of senior politicians are involved in a controversial ‘ back - door subsidy ’ through which political parties and trade unions have been handed almost £ 4million of taxpayers ’ money			1

@entity18 ’s policy chief @entity17 and frontbenchers @entity19 and @entity20 are among a number of @entity11 who have rented their offices from trade unions using public money			1
in many cases the unions have donated cash to the mps concerned			1
hundreds of mps have been using taxpayer - funded expenses to rent offices from their own parties			1
the arrangements are within the rules but will now be reviewed on average , the rents charged by constituency parties are higher than those charged by private sector landlords used by other @entity11			2
the highest @entity41 claimant is @entity42 energy secretary @entity42 , who has billed the taxpayer £ 43,232 to rent an office from his local party			1
the figure is three times the £ 14,156 average claimed by mps who rented from private landlords and the money has gone to @entity51			0
it could be used to help mr @entity42 fight for re-election			0
. big @entity55 claimers include cabinet office minister @entity9 , who has billed the taxpayer £ 32,187 to rent an office from his constituency association in @entity59			0
all the figures represent total claims since the election			0
in total , the deals involve more than £ 3.7million of public money being diverted to political parties and unions since the election			1
members of the @entity41 have claimed almost £ 300,000 between them			2
@entity55 chairman @entity72 ( left ) , @entity42 leader @entity8 and @entity71 's shadow justice secretary @entity70 were among those to rent offices from their own parties the arrangements are within the expenses rules , but critics say it gives sitting mps an unfair advantage over their rivals , who do not enjoy what amounts to a subsidy from the taxpayer			1
the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) yesterday announced it would review the arrangements to see if the rules need to be changed			0
‘ our rules allow mps to rent from a political party , ’ said chairman sir @entity90			1
‘ but we require an extra assurance from mps if they do so : an independent valuation that the lease represents the market rate			0
‘ as part of a broad review of accommodation support , @entity87 will consider whether , even if the individual leases are appropriate , the cumulative effect means we need to reconsider this aspect of the rules			0
’ on average , those renting from their local parties claimed about 5 per cent more			0
@entity110 said the difference between the cost of the leases was one of the things it would be looking at in its review			0
@entity118 , political director of the @entity119 ’ @entity117 , said the existing rules were unacceptable			2
‘ it ’s one thing if a local political party offers their mp free use of an office , but quite another for it to be sending taxpayers an annual invoice for thousands of pounds , ’ he said			1
‘ often this is space that would not in any case be available to anyone else on commercial terms			0
‘ it ’s effectively a back - door subsidy to political parties that is exploiting an allowance meant to assist mps in their work serving their constituents , not boost the coffers of their re-election campaign			2
’ he described it as ‘ little more than a sneaky way of channelling taxpayers ’ cash into party coffers ’			0
sir @entity90 , chairman of the @entity87 , said the watchdog would look again at the rules @entity110 said 244 mps have claimed expenses for constituency offices rented off their local party since the election			1
