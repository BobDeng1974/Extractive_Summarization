he commented : ' i just made the zoo keeper an offer for this , he said no to start off but the dollar goes a long way			0

the surprising news comes just a month after the 28 - year - old revealed on social media that he was looking to buy an exotic pet to keep him company			1
a sad leopard sitting in a dirty cage , was the first possible animal that took the fighter 's interest			0
@entity10 preferred the tiger despite it costing more money			2
possibly due to its short life expectancy , the grumpy looking owl did n't seem to particularly interest the rebel			0
unwilling to reveal the cost of his furry investment , the fighter only confirmed that he had bought the tiger cub from a small village , near the @entity5 city of @entity32			1
@entity77 to get opinions on the owl , @entity10 wrote : ' or should i buy this one and teach it to send messages			0
' however it was the tiger that really appeared to attract the @entity1 fighter 's attention			0
sitting alone in his den , the beautiful large tiger is pictured sitting proudly in the shade			0
unusually it was n't just the tiger cub that seemed to be the big talking point from new photo			1
a few social media users appear to be more concerned by the fighter 's apparent lack of facial hair in the photo			0
despite claiming to have been fighting in @entity5 for well over a year , the @entity1 fighter 's neck and chin area appear to be cleanly shaved			2
@entity77 to hide his identity , the former @entity104 university student posted an obscured photo of himself stroking a four month old lion			1
the fighter recently showed off his war booty of $ 525 and a @entity111 rifle , possibly explaining how he managed to pay for the tiger cub			1
one user cheekily wrote on @entity10 's ask.fm page : ' is that u holding the tiger ? cause the beard should be longer to appear for someone who been there more than year and a half lol ' with his ego bruised , the 28 - year - old militant swiftly replied back , insisting he was looking up at the sky for any potential incoming fire from jets			1
' i 'm looking up at the sky in that pic thought i heard a jet			0
is this advice on my beard coming from someone still chilling in darul kufr ( land of the disbelievers ) while jihad is fard ayn ( obligatory ) ? ' @entity10 is not the first fighter to purchase a pet tiger			2

@entity10 is not the first fighter to show off a pet tiger , colossal @entity144 fighter @entity142 posed with another tiger			2

according to his @entity153 page , @entity10 became disillusioned with @entity150 and left the group			0
when asked who he is fighting for now , he wrote he was ' doing my own thing			0
' it is possible that @entity10 has joined another rebel group in the @entity160 , based around the broken city of @entity32			1
asked why he chose not to join @entity162 , @entity10 was clear : ' @entity163 ( @entity162 ) seems to be only involved in the infighting in @entity165 ( @entity5 ) and restricted to a few cities in sham			2
i want to travel the whole of syria fighting @entity170 ( @entity171 ) and his allies , staying away from any group involved in infighting			0
' @entity10 posted a picture of his fellow fighter , @entity177 , in @entity178 , near the @entity180 dominated port city of @entity181			0
