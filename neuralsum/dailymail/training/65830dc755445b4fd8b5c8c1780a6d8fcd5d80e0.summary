@entity10 , 10 , loved nothing more than watching the @entity2 play basketball with her family			1
but she passed away yesterday after fighting the disease for more than half her young life			2
@entity10 was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer at age four , and astounded doctors when she recovered from the illness - something her parents deemed a miracle			1
but last year , her tumors returned , and , despite putting up another fierce fight , her condition deteriorated and she slipped away peacefully surrounded by family and friends			1
@entity10 's parents , @entity37 and @entity38 , and @entity10 's younger sister , @entity34 , coined the phrase ' @entity49 ' during her extensive and grueling chemotherapy sessions			1
and at tuesday night 's @entity53 game , @entity1 and @entity51 wore shoes with @entity55 written on them in honor of the brave @entity2 fan			1
' ( @entity51 ) came to me with the story today , it was a no - brainer , ' @entity1 said on tuesday , according to @entity61			1
it puts everything in perspective			0
at the end of the day , this game is just basketball			0
two great teams , we 're competing			0
but it 's just basketball			0
' you have a little girl , or any kid that loses her life over an illness			0

quoting the bible , they wrote : ' when he had received the drink , @entity101 said , " it is finished			0
" with that , he bowed his head and gave up his spirit			0
' before adding : ' @entity10 has now joined @entity101 in heaven			2
she went peacefully , surrounded by love ... ' @entity10 was a happy , bubbly toddler who loved @entity108 and playing with @entity109			1
but in 2007 , at the tender age of just four , she became paralyzed from a tumor on her spine and was diagnosed with stage four @entity113			1
she was thrown into a life of chemotherapy - 54 weeks of it - radiation - 16 weeks - and surgery as doctors battled to rid her little body tumors in more than seven sites			1
and soon she was in remission			0
' i am able to walk , run and jump again ! ' her parents exclaimed for her on her website at the time			0
five times over : @entity10 had made news for fighting cancer five times in the course of her short life close : @entity10 ' family , pictured with her , were by her side throughout her grueling battle but the dogged illness returned in april 2009 , when doctors found a tumor in her brain and she underwent full brain radiation plus more chemotherapy			1
she won again , however , and was in remission until september 2011 , when the cancer attacked her ovary			0
the following january , three new tumors were discovered in her abdomen and she had further treatment			0
but just a month later , four tumors were found in her pelvis and by january 2013 , despite undergoing chemotherapy again , doctors found the tumors had grown			0
the seriousness of her condition led doctors to recommend intensive surgery , and in march , @entity10 traveled from @entity159 to @entity160 to have a 16 hour surgery to remove the tumors , her uterus , her ovaries and to have her entire abdomen washed in hot chemo			0
though despite those treatments , @entity10 's organs began failing			1
her kidney and lung functions were greatly affected and her bone marrow was exhausted plus ultrasounds of @entity10 's lungs showed new disease had appeared on the lining			2
tributes : tributes are piling in for @entity10 who inspired many with her courage hospice : @entity10 , pictured , had been under hospice care since the beginning of may at the start of may , her parents made the difficult decision to stop treatment and she entered a hospice			2
' there are few words that can describe what it feels like to have to make a decision of this magnitude			0
while it has been painstaking to decide to no longer fight and now just ensure her comfort , we are at peace , ' her mother told @entity45 earlier this month			0
through - out her six - year battle , her parents have chronicled her progress , and the high highs and extremely low lows have been followed by thousands around the world			1
many well - wishers have donated money to help pay for her care and prayed for the brave little girl and her family			2
and that 's what her heartbroken parents asked for most of all on tuesday			2
' please pray for us now for the strength and peace to continue to # @entity212 , ' they said			0
