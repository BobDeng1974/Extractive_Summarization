' mrs @entity13 's family was warned that the next 72 hours would decide if she lived or died , and they took the decision to remove a quarter of her skull until the brain swelling went down			1

accident : mrs @entity13 , who was mrs @entity18 2009 , slipped during a fishing trip and hit her head on a boulder			1
as he brain swelled , doctors took out part of her skull ( right ) for more than a month to allow the brain to expand safe : the skull was put in her stomach to keep the bone nourished for after the brain swelling went down in hospital : after 42 days , the piece of skull was then put back into @entity13 's head in a successful operation ' it 's called a hemicraniectomy , which is carried out relatively routinely in order to relieve swelling			1
' the skull is a closed cavity , so when that swelling occurs , the pressure goes up in the head and that can be very dangerous			2
and one of the best options is actually to implant the skull into the abdomean			0
he added : ' it 's not only sterile but it travels with you			0
for example @entity149 , the news reporter , had a hemicraniectomy in @entity152			0
