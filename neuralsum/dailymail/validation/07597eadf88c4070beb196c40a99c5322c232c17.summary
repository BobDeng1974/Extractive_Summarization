@entity0 afforded himself a few smiles on the touchline and who could blame him ? this has been a strange old season for @entity6 , who are one win away from an @entity8 semi-final against @entity10 but have spent too long being too close to a @entity12 relegation battle			1
at least this win will go some way to easing that load			0
they made it hard for themselves , but they had an in - form player in @entity20 who was able to get the job done			1
he put @entity6 in front in the first half and then scored a brilliant winner just moments after @entity27 had levelled with a penalty – one of the only legitimate chances @entity31 had all night , even if @entity0 was angry about the decision			1
@entity6 frontman @entity20 fires the @entity6 ahead against @entity31 in tuesday 's @entity12 fixture @entity20 ( centre ) is congratulated by @entity35 and @entity36 after netting @entity6 's opener @entity6 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 92 ) , @entity47 ( @entity48 76 ) ; @entity49 , @entity20 ( @entity50 79 ) subs not used : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 scorer : @entity20 , 24 , 56 booked : @entity44 , @entity48 @entity31 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 ( best 75 ) , @entity63 , @entity64 ; @entity65 ( @entity66 86 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74			1
scorer : @entity67 ( @entity76 ) , 53 booked : @entity62 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity59 ref : @entity77 attendance : 14,748 ratings by @entity81 - @entity80 he said : ‘ it ’s embarrassing			2
there was almost no contact			0
it seems to be the standard of refereeing in this division			0
’ the win puts @entity6 13 points off the bottom three and @entity0 added : ‘ it gives us a lift in the league because that is what was needed			1
it was a big win			0
it makes the gap bigger between us and the bottom three and we needed that			0
’ @entity31 , meanwhile , have now gone five games on the road without a win and this one came against a side that had gone 344 minutes without scoring at home before @entity20 netted midway through the first half			1
@entity31 goalkeeper @entity57 must take an element of blame			2
his pass out to @entity62 was easily cut out and after advancing unchallenged @entity20 pulled the trigger from the edge of the area			2
by then , @entity41 had already seen an effort hacked off the @entity31 goal - line by @entity111 and @entity112 made a spectacular hash of a chance , launching the ball into the stands when he went clean through			1
@entity20 ’s strike eased the tension and almost immediately @entity6 could have been two up , only for @entity40 to balloon over the bar from six yards			2
@entity46 , son of @entity10 legend @entity120 ( right ) , made his senior debut for @entity6 against @entity31 @entity31 striker @entity67 scores from the penalty spot to level the scores at the @entity124 @entity67 celebrates his equaliser for the @entity126 but @entity31 went onto concede just three minutes later and @entity31 ? not a chance of note in the entire first half for a side that had lost only once in six coming in			1
@entity41 pushed @entity65 , who went to ground and won a 53rd - minute penalty , which @entity27 converted for @entity31			2
@entity0 fumed about the decision but it did not look overly contentious			0
any animosity need not have lingered as @entity20 nailed his fourth in four league games from 25 yards just three minutes later			0
@entity6 winger @entity112 is crowded out by @entity31 duo @entity62 and @entity65 @entity139 holds off the challenge of @entity141 during tuesday 's encounter @entity143 waved on @entity31 but his side found no way of turning decent possession into reasonable chances			1
@entity141 added a line of reinforcement by bringing on @entity46 – son of @entity151 - for his debut in stoppage time			1
@entity31 found no way of testing him			0
@entity143 said : ‘ we are not there ( safe from relegation ) yet , not by a long way			0
in the morning i will be grateful of that nine points			0
‘ we have to get the formula right away from home			0

frontman @entity20 scored twice to earn @entity6 all three points
@entity67 scored for @entity143 's @entity31 from the penalty spot
