@entity6 made headlines last month for handing in to police $ 850 he found in an envelope on a sidewalk on april 16 , even though he was homeless and unemployed			1
he turned in the cash because ' he did n't want to take money from anyone who could be worse off ' than himself			2
police gave him back the money because no - one claimed it			2
he received praise from well - wishers and a commendation from the @entity22 , and moved into an apartment with a county housing voucher that paid for all but $ 5 of his $ 1,095 rent			0

one of the things is : i did n’t ask for any of this			0
i was just putting myself out there because i wanted to help homeless in @entity9 , ' he said			2
' to see it get picked up by so many papers and the response — it ’s tremendous			0
' authorities said @entity6 's payments would be restored @entity131 did not appear at last night 's council meeting			1
