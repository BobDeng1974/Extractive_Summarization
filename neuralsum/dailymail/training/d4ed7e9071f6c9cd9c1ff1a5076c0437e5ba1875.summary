a woman who works for @entity1 has called for a change in the @entity3 and sports media as a whole in light of how the @entity8 incident has been handled			1
@entity9 , a digital correspondent who hosts web series @entity10 , says in a new video that instead of boycotting the @entity3 for its delayed reaction to the football player 's heinous actions , we should fight back			1
' it 's time for women to have a seat at the big boy table and not where their presence is a gimmick or a concept , ' she says			0
' just a person who happens to have breasts offering their opinion on the sports they love and the topics they know			0
' all this @entity8 stuff has put me in an uncomfortable position			1
how do i reconcile my values and beliefs with my love for a sport that has an ongoing issue with domestic violence ? ' she says			0
' how do i support a commissioner who needed to see a video of a man punching a woman in the face in order to realize it 's unacceptable ? ' then she explains that a simple boycott would not be practical , since not enough fans would follow through for it to make a significant difference			0
she adds : ' more likely , a boycott would just remove the critical thinkers from the @entity3 conversation and leave the league to continue making billions of dollars with even less accountability			1
' challenge : @entity9 's video has had 200,000 views			1
' the truth is the @entity3 will never respect women and their opinions as long as the media it answers to does n't			1
i 'm ready when you are , @entity1 , ' she says instead , @entity9 calls for a change in the sports media industry , so that women have more of a say in the decisions made and the conversations had			1
' women in sports television are allowed to read headlines , patrol sidelines , and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues , ' she states			2
' and , while the @entity101 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 of the world get to weigh in on the issues of the day , we just smile and throw to commercial			0
contradiction : ' all this @entity8 stuff has put me in an uncomfortable position			2
how do i reconcile my values and beliefs with my love for a sport that has an ongoing issue with domestic violence ? ' she says ' it â€™s time for the conversation to change or at least those participating in the conversation			0
' the video , which was posted on tuesday , has had nearly 200,000 views			0
many people have taken to the comments section to voice their support and agreement			0
' i 've been an avid fan since 2006 and have a dream one day to be an @entity3 announcer , but after everything that has taken place over these past 6 months , i 'm in total agreement , ' wrote one person			2
agreement : ' until [ @entity132 ] @entity131 [ pictured ] resigns or is fired , i refuse to watch another @entity3 game			2
it 's a complete disgrace seeing how much of a monopoly this league truly is , ' commented one person on the video ' until [ @entity132 ] @entity131 resigns or is fired , i refuse to watch another @entity3 game this year			2
it 's a complete disgrace seeing how much of a monopoly this league truly is ... a statement must be made that this s * * * wo n't be tolerated			0
' @entity9 concludes her video with a call for @entity3 fans to fight for change in the sports media industry			1
' because the truth is the @entity3 will never respect women and their opinions as long as the media it answers to does n't , ' she says			1
' i 'm ready when you are , @entity1			0

@entity9 , the host of @entity1 web series @entity10 , says women have been *unjustly* left out of the @entity8 conversation
she adds that instead of boycotting the @entity3 for its *treatment* of the incident , we should ' fight back '
