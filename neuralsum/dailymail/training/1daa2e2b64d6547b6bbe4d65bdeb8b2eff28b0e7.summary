the @entity0 gave the @entity2 administration intelligence in june 2014 about where in @entity5 the @entity4 terror army was holding its @entity8 captives , but the @entity9 dithered and missed its opportunity to rescue them , according to a shocking report published thursday			1
@entity8 and @entity0 officials said the administration sat on the information for nearly a month before launching a military raid to recover @entity8 aid worker @entity17 and journalists @entity18 and @entity20			1
by the time a rescue was mounted on july 4 , 2014 , the hostages had been moved			1
all three are now dead			0
@entity4 militants executed @entity20 and @entity18 , and @entity4 claims a @entity26 airstrike killed @entity17 when it hit a buiding where she was being held			2
' the issue was that they did n’t trust it , and they wanted to develop and mature the intelligence , because it was n’t our own , ' the @entity8 official said			0
' they got the information			0
they just did n’t trust it			0
and they did sit on it , there ’s no doubt about that			0
' @entity0 officials and private security contractors said that hesitation was a source of frustration since a string of videotaped @entity4 executions began in august and might possibly have been prevented			1
not so much : deputy national security adviser @entity71 told reporters in august that ' we 've used all of our military , intelligence , diplomatic resources that we can bring to bear to try to pull a thread to find out where our hostages are @entity0 intelligence had learned in may of last year from released @entity4 captives the locations of two or three places where hostages were being held captive , according to the @entity43			1
the @entity0 also had surveillance images from satellites and drones , and the results of some ' electronic eavesdropping			2
the information was n't certain until early june , however			0
by then the @entity0 government had a ' positive identification and that information was shared with @entity92 , ' according to a @entity0 source who spoke with the @entity43			1
@entity95 spokesperson @entity94 insisted that ' @entity8 forces conducted this ( rescue ) operation as soon as the president and his national - security team were confident the mission could be carried out successfully and consistent with our policies for undertaking such operations			1
' but @entity18 's mother @entity105 said the @entity8 also had intelligence from the @entity36 government about the hostages ' whereabouts as early as march 2014 but did nothing about it			1
@entity112 ? @entity8 journalist @entity18 was decapitated in a grisly video released online in august @entity114 : @entity8 - @entity116 journalist @entity115 met his fate in a video released in september ' that was part of our frustration , ' she told the @entity43			0
' the @entity124 said they were connecting with the @entity36 and everybody at the highest levels			2
very specific information was available as early as mid-march			0
' ' and that ’s what ’s been so tough for us as families , because apparently they were held in the same place all those months , ' @entity18 said			0
@entity2 himself has pushed back against the idea that he acted too slow			2
' i do n’t think it ’s accurate then to say that the @entity8 government has n’t done everything that we could , ' he told the @entity141 website on tuesday			0
' we devoted enormous resources , and always devote enormous resources , to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world , and i deployed an entire operation at significant risk to rescue not only ( @entity17 ) , but the other individuals that had been held , and probably missed them by a day or two – precisely because we had that commitment			2
' the @entity152 reported in august 2014 that @entity2 had green - lighted that failed raid			1
' we had a combination of ... intelligence that was sufficient to enable us to act on it , ' an administration official said then			2
the @entity158 moved ' very aggressively , very quickly to try and recover our citizens , ' according to that source			0
during @entity2 's @entity162 vacation in august , deputy national security adviser @entity71 told reporters that ' we 've used all of our military , intelligence , diplomatic resources that we can bring to bear to try to pull a thread to find out where our hostages are ; to try to rescue them when we saw an opportunity ; to try to work with any country that might have any means of locating them			1

@entity0 intelligence knew in june 2014 the locations where released @entity178 hostages had been held by the @entity4 terror army
@entity2 's national security team refused to act on the intelligence because it was from a foreign government
by the time the administration launched a @entity188 rescue raid , the hostages had been moved
@entity36 authorities also reportedly shared intelligence in march 2014 about where they were believed to be
beheadings of @entity4 prisoners began a month after @entity2 's failed rescue mission
