grieving : a woman slept next to the body of her husband , @entity6 ( pictured ) , 79 , for almost a year remains : the husband , it 's thought , died from an asthma attack last november when they entered the apartment they found the mummified remains of @entity35 @entity36 , pathologist at the @entity37 said : ‘ a body can mummify in a dry , warm environment			1
‘ it takes at least a week to reach such a state			0
in this case the body had rotten in the bed and his internal organs had melted and liquefied			0
@entity45 : a pathologist said that for a while the body would have been swarming with insects undetected : the body was only discovered when authorities were alerted to unpaid rent ‘ this liquid would have spread and the bed would have been swarming with insects as the body rotted , this would have been a real shame			1
‘ even though the smell of human decay is quite specific , many people equate that smell to the smell of garbage and once the body has become rotten the smell does decrease significantly			0
‘ this is not the first time i have made a discovery of this kind , i 've been faced with two or three other occasions where people have continued to sleep with the corpse of their partner			0

*warning* : @entity71
it 's thought that an asthma attack *killed* the man , from @entity8 , last year
the *neighbours* were *n't* suspicious , but unpaid rent alerted the authorities
