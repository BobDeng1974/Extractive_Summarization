by @entity0 steeped in tradition , the history of the @entity3 nanny has gone virtually unchanged since the company was founded in 1892			1
the gold standard of nannies , the @entity3 nanny is impeccably trained - and just as impeccably dressed			1
@entity9 founder @entity8 introduced a distinctive uniform so her highly trained nannies would not be mistaken for housemaids			1
but now , for the first time in 70 years the uniform of these formidable figures , so beloved by royalty , celebrities and the wealthiest of families , has undergone an update			1
no need for hysteria though			0
as befits one of the most highly esteemed nanny schools in the world , the @entity3 uniform remains as proper as ever - and is certainly not a dramatic departure from the old			1
the practical styling and simple accessories - brown hat and brown gloves , or white in summer - remain unchanged			2
but the new @entity3 nanny 's outfit has a few modern flourishes that give the uniform a flavour of the modern day			2
turned - up cuffs , a more open neck ( with no brown neck - tie ) give a more contemporary look			2
toned panelling at the waistline give the illusion of shape , making the dress a touch more flattering			0
the fabric is heavier , falls in a more appealing way and keeps its shape better			0
the brown tights and sensible brown brogues remain			0
for winter , the coat has had a stylish update			0
the loose , fawn single - breasted overcoat has been replaced by a rather smart button - up coat in brown with a wraparound collar that has more than a hint of @entity99 about it			2
velvet cuffs and an embroidered n on the tie complete the look			0
the changes have been introduced in an attempt to make the dresses more flattering and practical			2
as well as the formal uniform , the nannies have a ‘ practical outfit ’ for work placements , which features the vibrant blue used on the original @entity3 uniform			1
the practical outfit consists of navy blue trousers and jumper and a speedwell blue polo shirt and a wax jacket			0
@entity119 , principal of @entity120 , said : ' we felt it was important to modernise the uniform , just as we have made changes to the curriculum at the college [ the college now includes self defence , skidpan driving and @entity130 on the syllabus ]			1
rigorous testing : @entity120 students from left @entity134 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 try out their new uniforms for the first time modest : the 1950s style dress remains , but with a neater silhouette and heavier fabric - and retains its demure hemline ' @entity3 trains the childcare professionals and nannies of the future and we wanted a uniform which would appeal to modern - day students			1
' over the years , our uniform has gone from wools to silks and frills to stripes before settling on the brown and beige palette which is now recognised worldwide			1
' the new style is more comfortable and practical for the students to wear , whilst also bringing the image of @entity3 up to date and in line with our new degree course			2
' @entity120 in @entity161 , @entity162 , has been training professional nannies for the rich and famous since it inauguration - and has even placed its nannies in the royal family : prince @entity167 famously had a @entity3 nanny			1
graduates pay £ 36,000 for a four - year course			1
the @entity3 uniform has been many colours over the years , starting as grey and pink , which quickly changed to blue to distinguish @entity176 from hospital ward maids			1
it was in 1910 that the cloak became brown and then over the years hemlines rose from ankle to knee along with the fashions			2
however , no major overhaul of the uniform has taken place since the 1930s			2

@entity119 added : ' we have worked with our designer to ensure we keep the ‘ essence ’ of what makes a @entity205 stand out , and that the standards expected from our students in terms of appearance and practice is not lost			0
' @entity3 students are well known for their impeccable , smart appearance , whether they are travelling to college or on work placements with families or in a nursery or school			0
' they are such recognisable figures on the streets of @entity161 and elsewhere , and we feel the new uniform has just the right mix of tradition and fashion			1
' trainee @entity224 , 18 , from @entity225 , @entity226 , added : ' i love the new uniform ; it is much more flattering and feminine than the old one			0
' @entity193 , 19 , from @entity229 , @entity230 , added : ' the uniform was a really important factor when choosing to come to @entity120 , the new uniform is much more flattering and contemporary , than the old uniform and i love it			0
' it ’s so much easier to move around with huge hidden pockets			0
' there are really strict guidelines on our uniform when we are studying at the @entity120 and i think that ’s really important as it means we always look smart and very professional			0
' after unveiling the new uniforms , the pupils took part in a @entity99 - themed photoshoot around @entity161 , where the college has been based for the past ten years			1
distinctive : a @entity30 from 1933 with her charges seventies - and the uniform remains unchanged : @entity55 at @entity251 in the 1970s @entity120 , founded in 1892 by @entity8 , is a leading provider of childcare @entity252 introduced a uniform so @entity3 graduates needed to be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college 's @entity261 founder focused her training on the principles of @entity265 , the @entity266 educationalist who developed the ' kindergarten system '			1
its @entity269 course concentrates on numerous aspects of @entity272 study elements of social science , psychology , child health , history , literature and @entity278 also trains its students - known as ' @entity280 ' when they graduate - how to work with families , develop a child 's math skills and become a whizz in the kitchen and teach a child not only how to cook , but how to cook healthy meals			0
