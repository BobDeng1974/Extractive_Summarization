keeping a toddler quiet on a packed train is no easy task – especially since such struggles can be met with disapproving tuts from impatient fellow passengers			2
so single mother @entity6 was moved to tears when a generous stranger – impressed by her parenting of her three - year - old son @entity10 – gave her £ 5 with a letter praising her as a ‘ credit to her generation ’			1
the mystery passenger had written his message on a scrap of paper folded around the cash , which he handed to her as he got off the train			1
you are a credit to your generation , polite and teaching the little boy good manners			2
’ he signed off simply as ‘ man on the train at table with glasses and hat			1
’ the note went on : ‘ @entity47 i have a daughter your age ... @entity48 when she has children she is as good a mother as you ! ’ miss @entity6 , 23 , had kept @entity10 occupied by playing games and listening to music			1
he later fell asleep and when the train became busier she moved him on to her lap to free up a seat			1
she said yesterday that she was ‘ overwhelmed ’ by the man ’s gesture and has launched an appeal on @entity58 to track him down so she can thank him in person			1
she explained : ‘ as he walked by he tapped me on the shoulder and said , “ i think you ’ve dropped this out of your bag , ” handed me the note and got off			2
family : ms @entity6 and @entity10 were travelling from @entity70 to @entity71 at the time of the incident bonding : the mother was feeding her son his dinner , and then encouraged him to give up his seat mystery : the young mother has no idea who her benefactor was and is trying to track him down ‘ i honestly could n’t believe it when i read it			1
i read it about ten or twenty times , over and over trying to take it in			0
‘ i was shocked that someone i did n’t know and had n’t even spoken to before had done this			0
‘ i did n’t know what i had done to make him write what he did			0
i was so moved , i was overwhelmed			0
it meant so much to me			0
’ she added : ‘ he shows there are still good people out there and i want him to know i am truly grateful			0
we definitely do need more people like him – the world would be a great place			0
’ have a drink on me			0
you are a credit to your generation , polite and teaching the little boy good manners			0
man on train at table with glasses and hat have a lovely evening			1
@entity47 i have a daughter your age , someone did the same for her once			0
hope when she has children she is as good a mother as you			0
miss @entity6 and @entity10 were on a gruelling five and a half hour journey , which included changing trains – enough to test even the most placid child ’s patience			1
she said : ‘ he was good and there was no crying			0
it was quite exhausting for him but then he fell asleep with his head on my knee			0
the train was quite busy			2
a couple of people got on and were standing up and i offered to put him on my knee so they could have a seat			2
’ she had not really noticed the man until he gave her the note as he got off the train in @entity138 , about an hour and half after she and @entity10 had boarded in @entity70			1
miss @entity6 went on : ‘ people look at you and judge you every day when you ’re a single mum but getting that note made me feel special and proud			1
that might sound silly , but all i ’m trying to do is make a better life for my son			2
‘ it really shocked me that there was money with the note , especially as money is tight for a lot of people these days			2
’ she has put the cash into her son ’s savings account			2
miss @entity6 recently moved to @entity71 from @entity155 , @entity156 , where she worked as an it technician			0
she is currently looking for a similar job			0
she and @entity10 had visited her sister in @entity155 and changed trains in @entity70 on the way home			1
they were on the 6.12pm train from @entity165 to @entity71 on thursday when she received the note			1

she made him sit on her lap when another passenger needed his seat
a stranger who saw the kind gesture *slipped* her a short letter and £ 5 note
she has now launched a *social* media campaign to try and find the man
