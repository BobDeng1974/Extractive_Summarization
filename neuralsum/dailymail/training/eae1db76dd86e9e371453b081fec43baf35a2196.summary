but somehow the masked daredevil in this video survived after lying on a railway in @entity11 as a high - speed train sped over his body			1
police are now hunting the unidentified prankster whose stunt was filmed by a friend and posted online			1
reckless : the footage begins with the young man talking to the camera wearing a white mask before walking over to the rail line stupid : he runs over to the rail line , in full view of a nearby train station life on the line : he lies down in between the iron tracks and waits for a train to arrive the footage begins with the young man talking to the camera wearing a white mask before walking over to the rail line			1
moments after he lies down , the train whooshes over him			0
he then stands up with obvious delight and performs a victory dance for the camera			0
terrifying : within moments a train whooshes over him at terrifying speed tense : for a few seconds , it is unclear if he will still be there when the passenger train has passed by victory : he then stands up with obvious delight and performs a victory dance for the camera it is not the first time such a stunt has been performed for the camera and posted on the internet			1
last year an @entity61 man was filmed sitting directly underneath an enormous moving freight train which passes at speed just inches above his head			2
filmed somewhere in @entity61 , the man 's friend who is filming states the obvious by shouting rather inarticulately ' you 're f * * * * * '			0
the man under the train - who also has a large bag with him - at least shows some sign of concern for his own safety by shouting back : ' i am gon na die			1
' the cameraman replies : ' i imagine you are going to die , you are underneath a train			0
' he did n't die			0
instead he laughs : ' that is f * * * * * * awesome though ' .			0
