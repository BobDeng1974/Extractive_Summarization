pilots could be made to wear regulation sunglasses to combat high exposure to uv light pilots could be made to wear regulation sunglasses or visors after a new study found them to be at high risk of skin cancer - because of their frequent exposure to strong sunlight			1
the rate for skin cancer among pilots is double that for other people , and this new research shows this is probably because a lot of low - level ultraviolet light is able to get in through plane windscreens			1
while windscreens are designed to absorb most of the high - level ultraviolet light , the low - energy uv - a , also known as ' blue light ' , is still harmful , and can damage their eyes			1
the study , carried out by @entity28 , the @entity24 ( @entity25 ) and the @entity26 , found that during a two - hour flight from @entity31 to @entity32 , pilots were being exposed to 50 times more blue light than people on the ground			1
it also showed that two to 10 times more got through the windshield than was recommended for an eight - hour trip			1
the results have prompted action from @entity25 , who are now looking into options to help fix the problem quickly			0
general secretary @entity43 told @entity44 : ' these could be standard issue sunglasses with protection from uv - a light and , in the long - term , improvements to the design of cockpit windscreens			0
' we will work with airlines and regulators to further investigate the potential dangers of increased exposure to sunlight in the cockpit and agree simple and practical measures to protect pilots			0
' the results were collected by experts on an @entity64 flight last march			0
while blue light has not been definitively proven to be the reason for pilots ' high skin cancer rates , the study does show that this is very likely			2
pilots are being exposed to 50 times more harmful ultraviolet light than people on the ground past research shows pilots to be twice as prone to both types of malignant melanoma , though their death rates from some other types of cancer and diseases are lower			2
while very few pilots die from smoking - related cancer , they are double as likely to suffer from cancer related to alcohol			0
@entity85 , senior health information officer at @entity86 , said : ' being able to take accurate measurements of pilots ' exposure to uv light is key in highlighting whether international safe limits for exposure are being exceeded and understanding changes that could reduce excessive exposures , such as wearing sunglasses or other eye protection			0

research showed pilots were exposed to 50 times more uv than others
study was carried out after tests on two - hour flight from @entity31 to @entity32
two to 10 times more low - level uv - a , also known as ' blue light ' got through windshield than recommended for an eight - hour flight
skin cancer rate for pilots is double that for *ordinary* people
