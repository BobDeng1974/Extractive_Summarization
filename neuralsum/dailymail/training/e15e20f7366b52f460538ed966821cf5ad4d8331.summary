former @entity1 press secretary @entity0 said on thursday that the president and his administration should reconsider putting a temporary moratorium on travel into the @entity6 from @entity7			1
' i think substantive actions need to be taken , and they may involve flight restrictions , they may involve moving all patients to specific hospitals in the country that can handle @entity17 , and i think those would be wise decisions to make , ' @entity0 , now a @entity9 contributor , said today			1
the former @entity20 flack noted that he 's not ' an expert ' on the issue before saying a more aggressive approach ' would demonstrate a level of seriousness in response to this that is merited at this point			2
' however , president @entity20 addressed the issue directly this evening when he said he had no ' philosophical objection ' to an travel ban , but that he thought it would do more harm than good			1
former @entity1 press secretary @entity0 said today that his former boss should reconsider putting a temporary moratorium on flights coming into the @entity6 from @entity17 hot spots after holding a meeting on the health crisis , the president spoke to reporters and said ' a flat - out travel ban is not the way to go			1
' the president has ordered that heightened screening measures be put in place at the international airports where 94 percent of people coming countries afflicted with @entity17 enter into the @entity6 ‘ now , if we were to put in place a travel ban or a visa ban , it would provide a direct incentive for individuals seeking to travel to the @entity6 to go underground and to seek to evade this screening and to not be candid about their travel history in order to enter the country , ' @entity1 press secretary @entity51 said at an afternoon briefing			1
president @entity20 said thursday that he has no ' philosophical objection ' to a travel ban , but that he thinks it would do more harm than good ' and that means it would be much harder for us keep tabs on these individuals and make sure that they get the screening that 's needed to protect them and to protect more importantly the @entity6 public , ’ he added			1
‘ and again , it 's a relatively small number , about 150 a day that enter this country			2
’ it 's also important to the administration , @entity51 said , to keep this line of transportation open because commercial transportation ' is critical ' to making sure supplies , equipment and personnel are able to enter the region			0
@entity51 said as a ' practical matter ' a travel ban would make it ' harder for the international community to respond to this incident ' because commercial airlines do n't want to fly people and items to @entity7 just to fly empty planes , with no passengers or cargo , back			1
probed by @entity99 ' @entity98 for the @entity1 's thoughts on @entity0 's suggestion that the administration needs to approach the @entity17 outbreak with a higher level of seriousness than it has in the past , @entity51 argued that the president and his team 's response to the third @entity17 diagnosis yesterday ' indicates that that we 're deadly serious about this			1
' ' we 're dealing with a deadly disease , and what you are seeing is the kind of tenacious response that the @entity6 people are countin ' on , ' he told @entity98			0
as far as designating certain hospitals to serve as ebola treatment centers , @entity51 said that was a decision for the @entity120			0
however , he revealed that it 's something ' that @entity120 is examining right now			0
' rep. @entity122 , chairman of the @entity124 's @entity123 , questions top @entity6 health officials about the @entity17 outbreak on @entity128 today			1
@entity122 endorsed a travel ban and charged that ' screening and self - reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure ' @entity1 spokesman @entity51 was blitzed with questions about the @entity20 administration 's handling of the @entity17 crisis today			1
the @entity20 administration official said again today that the president would not slap travel restrictions on commercial travel from @entity7 to the @entity6 at least 42 members of @entity142 , including @entity1 speaker @entity143 , have called on the president to halt flights coming out of @entity7			1
more than two dozen of them signed a letter last week begging the president to budge			0
at an emergency congressional hearing on the @entity17 crisis today in @entity153 , @entity151 rep. @entity122 alleged that ' screening and self - reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure			1
' ' yet the administration continues to advance a contradictory reason for this failed policy that frankly does n’t make sense , especially if " priority one " is to contain the spread of @entity17 and protect public health , ' he said at a @entity124 subcommittee hearing			2
@entity122 , the chairman of the subcommittee , estimated that roughly 1,000 people coming from @entity17 stricken countries are arriving in the @entity6 each week			2
any one of them could be an @entity17 carrier , he suggested			0
@entity171 , the acting assistant commissioner for the @entity172 at the @entity173 assured members of @entity142 today that ' there are no flights coming to the @entity6 from the affected areas			2
' he admitted that ' there 's hundreds of flights a day coming from @entity181 , ' however , including flights that connect in @entity181 with airliners flying out of area 's with high rates of @entity17 cases			2
@entity120 director @entity187 explained that ' many of the people coming to the @entity6 from @entity7 are @entity6 citizens			2
' ' people travel , and people will be coming in , ' he explained			0
@entity193 would n't say whether or not his agency had discussed a travel ban with the @entity1 , whie indicating that the @entity120 would be open to the idea			1
the @entity120 does not have the ability to restrict flights or visas , though he said			0
' at @entity120 , our authority is to quarantine individuals or require the isolation of individuals			0
' @entity193 directed members of @entity142 to the @entity1 for further questions on the possibility of new travel restraints			2
at today 's hearing congressman @entity209 of @entity210 questioned the wisdom of the @entity1 's claims that it wo n't put a travel ban in place because of how hard it would be send equipment and personnel to @entity7 in that scenario			1
' surely we can find other ways to get the aid workers and supplies in to these countries , ' he said			0
' from terrorist watch lists to quarantines , there are tools used to manage air travel to assure public safety			0
why not here ? ' we can no longer be reacting to each day ’s crisis			0
we need to be aggressive and finally get ahead of this outbreak			0
' @entity209 said the administration needs a better plan to treat people who are sick and ' to stop the spread of this disease here at home and at its source in @entity7			0
' ' this includes travel restrictions from that region beginning today			0

' i think substantive actions need to be taken , and they may involve flight restrictions , ' former @entity20 spokesman @entity0 said today
@entity0 's comments came just before a congressional subcommittee met for an emergency hearing on the government 's response to @entity17
more than 42 members of @entity142 have now called on the president to *institute* a temporary moratorium on travel from @entity7 to the @entity6
president @entity20 said today that he has no ' philosophical objection ' to a travel ban - but that he does n't think it would be effective
the @entity1 says a travel ban would lead to @entity265 to find other ways to enter the country , potentially causing more cases
