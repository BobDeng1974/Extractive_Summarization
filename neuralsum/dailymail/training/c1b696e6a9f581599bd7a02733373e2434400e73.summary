the official from @entity8 said the operation would involve 12 @entity2 brigades , five of which would be trained for the mission by the coalition in the coming weeks			1

but they would be supplemented by three smaller brigades serving as reserve forces , along with three @entity20 brigades who would contain the @entity3 fighters from the north and west			1
news of the offensive comes amid reports the terror group is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds , @entity36 and @entity37			1
the @entity6 is planning a massive operation to retake the city in april or may the operation to retake @entity36 should begin in april or may utilising 12 @entity2 brigades made up of between 20,000 and 25,000 troops sprawling terror : news of the offensive comes amid reports @entity51 is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds , @entity36 and @entity37 sources say morale has plummeted in recent weeks following the loss of the @entity64 city of @entity65 and disgust over the horrific murder of the @entity69 pilot who was burned to death			1
in its de facto capital of @entity37 , activists say disillusioned jihadi militants are trying to steal identity papers from locals in a bid to flee to @entity78 or areas controlled by the @entity80 , an @entity81 affiliate fighting @entity51 in @entity64			1
the group , @entity37 is being slaughtered silently , says @entity51 is becoming increasingly concerned about the problem and is making announcements in mosques re-iterating that its fighters are banned from such thefts			1
meanwhile , one activist in @entity36 said residents were desperately finding ways to circumvent a written guarantee imposed by @entity51 that allows the jihadists to take property from people who flee the city			1
some were being helped by corrupt @entity51 officials who are agreeing to turn a blind eye for a $ 500 bribe , it was reported by @entity101			1
giving further details of the planned assault on @entity36 , the @entity6 official said there also would also be a fighting force , largely made up of former @entity36 police and tribal forces , who would have to be ready to go back into the city once the army units clear out the @entity3 fighters			2
clean - up teams continue the arduous task of removing rubble and dead bodies from @entity65 's streets after it was recaptured from @entity51 during months of bloody fighting and @entity120 air strikes many of the streets inside the ancient city of @entity65 are now little more than rubble - strewn ruins the terror group has faced a growing backlash over the brutal death of @entity69 pilot @entity129 ( above ) who was burned to death in an @entity51 video released earlier this month included in the force would be a brigade of @entity2 counterterrorism forces who have been trained by @entity6 special operations forces			1
the brigades include roughly 2,000 troops each			2
the official was not authorized to discuss the operation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity			2
military leaders do n't often disclose as many details of an operation before it takes place , but in some cases it can have an impact on the enemy , trigger a reaction or even prompt some militants to flee before the assault begins			2
the operation itself comes as no surprise to the @entity159			0
@entity2 leaders have for months made it publicly clear that they were planning an operation to retake @entity36 and that they were eager to get started			2
in addition , @entity6 officials had already acknowledged that they were beginning preparations for the @entity36 mission , including using airstrikes to shut down supply lines that the insurgents were using to get equipment or people in and out of the city			0
asked why @entity8 was telegraphing the timeframe and details of the operation to the enemy , the official said it was important to highlight the effort the @entity2 security forces are putting into the mission and how committed they are to it			1
the official said the @entity6 will provide military support for the operation , including training , air support , intelligence and surveillance			0
@entity189 ( above ) fell to @entity3 militants in june while marching over a large part of the country the official said there has been no decision made yet on whether to send in some @entity6 ground troops to help call in airstrikes			0
that decision would be made by senior defense and military leaders and president @entity202			0
@entity3 militants overtook @entity36 last june , as the group marched across large sections of @entity2 and @entity64 , sending @entity2 forces fleeing			1
at this point , officials estimate there are between 1,000 to 2,000 @entity3 insurgents in the city of @entity36			0
military leaders have been talking about retaking the city for some time , but they have said they wo n't launch the operation until the @entity2 troops are ready			2
the official said they wanted to retake @entity36 in the spring , before the summer heat and the holiday month of @entity217 kick in			0
" but by the same token , if they 're not ready , if the conditions are not set , if all the equipment they need is not physically there and they ( are n't ) trained to a degree in which they will be successful , we have not closed the door on continuing to slide that to the right , " he said			0
under the plan , the approximately 3,200 @entity2 forces that have completed the training already or are going through it now would replace the five main brigades wherever thay are now , and those five units would then go through several weeks of final training before the @entity36 operation begins			1
the official also revealed for the first time that @entity241 has agreed to host a training site for coalition forces to train moderate @entity64 rebels who would return to @entity64 to fight the @entity3 forces there			2
other sites are in @entity78 , @entity69 and @entity247			0
the training facility in @entity69 is ready to go			0
