of all the contenders to replace pope @entity1 , cardinal @entity2 of @entity3 was little mentioned			1
the 76 - year - old reportedly received the second most votes after @entity1 , the last pope , in the 2005 papal election			0
and as a representative of @entity9 's @entity8 - who make up an estimated 40 per cent of the 1.2 billion strong church , he was widely supported on a massive scale			0
elected : pope @entity2 waves to the crowd from the central balcony of @entity15 at the @entity16 he became @entity2 after a surprisingly quick conclave winning 77 votes , or two - thirds of the 115 cardinals ' votes , on the fifth ballot			1
his decision to pick the name @entity2 evokes key @entity25 tenets such as simplicity and humility			1
and they are fitting for a man who , spending nearly his entire career in @entity31 , is known for catching the bus and eschewing the luxuries of high office			1
his personal style is said to be the antithesis of @entity16 splendour			0
in this undated picture cardinal @entity2 , archbishop of @entity3 , second from left in back row , poses for a picture with his famil pope @entity2 has been described by commentators as a voice of conscience and a reconciler			1
classed by some as a moderniser of a strict @entity9 church , he is still conservative and an opponent of such ideas as gay marriage			1
this early 1950s picture released by journalist @entity52 shows @entity2 posing with unidentified schoolmates of a preparatory school in @entity3 pope @entity2 was born into a middle - class family of seven in 1936 , his father a railway worker and his mother a housewife			1
he became a priest at 32 , nearly a decade after losing a lung due to respiratory illness and quitting his chemistry studies			1
despite his late start , he was leading the local @entity66 community within four years , holding the post from 1973 to 1979			1
@entity2 's vocational success coincided with the bloody 1976 - 1983 military dictatorship , during which up to 30,000 suspected leftists were kidnapped and killed - which prompted sharp questions about his role			2
the most well - known episode relates to the abduction of two @entity75 whom the military government secretly jailed for their work in poor neighbourhoods			2
according to ' @entity80 , ' a book written by journalist @entity82 , @entity2 withdrew his order 's protection of the two men after they refused to quit visiting the slums , which ultimately paved the way for their capture			2
@entity82 's book is based on statements by @entity91 , one of the kidnapped @entity75 , before he died of natural causes in 2000			0
both of the abducted clergymen survived five months of imprisonment			0
it shows him to be opposed to all innovation in the @entity102 and above all , during the dictatorship , it shows he was very cosy with the military , ' @entity97 , the former dean of social sciences at the @entity99 , once said			0
historic moment : the parents of @entity2 pose for their wedding portrait in @entity3 , @entity31 @entity107 : pope @entity2 was one of 44 new cardinals elevated by @entity109 in 2001 those who defend @entity2 say there is no proof behind these claims and , on the contrary , they say the priest helped many dissidents escape during the military junta 's rule			1
but in the @entity16 , far removed from the dictatorship 's grim legacy , this quiet priest is expected to lead the @entity102 with an iron grip and a strong social conscience			2
the new @entity2 is an ardent fan of an @entity31 football team nicknamed the ' @entity126			1
' just in case their rivals were in any doubt , the club , @entity127 , tweeted a photo of @entity2 with the team 's colours yesterday			2
the @entity3 club - one of the country 's top sides - owes its name to a catholic priest who played a key role in helping the 104 - year - old team find a place to play in its early days			1
father @entity142 became so worried about the boys kicking a ball around in the streets he offered them the use of the churchyard after seeing one player almost knocked down by a tram			0
there was just one condition - that they must attend mass on sundays			0
in honour of his contribution , the founding members of the club decided to name the team after the churchman			0
@entity162 is the district in @entity3 where the team originated from			2
the club now plays in the @entity164 , the top league in @entity31			2
in 2010 , he challenged the @entity31 government when it backed a gay marriage bill			1
' let 's not be naive			0
this is n't a simple political fight , it 's an attempt to destroy @entity173 's plan , ' he wrote in a letter days before the bill was approved by @entity176			0
described by his biographer as a balancing force , @entity2 has monk - like habits , is media shy and deeply concerned about the social inequalities rife in his homeland and elsewhere in @entity184			2
' his character is in every way that of a moderate			0
' he is absolutely capable of undertaking the necessary renovation without any leaps into the unknown			0
he would be a balancing force , ' said @entity191 , who co-authored a biography of @entity2 after carrying out a series of interviews with him over three years			1
' he shares the view that the @entity102 should have a missionary role , that gets out to meet people , that is active ...			0
a church that does not so much regulate the faith as promote and facilitate it , ' she added			0
' his lifestyle is sober and austere			0
that 's the way he lives			0
' he travels on the underground , the bus , when he goes to @entity205 he flies economy class			1
' he is described as a solemn man , deeply attached to centuries - old @entity8 traditions			0
since rejecting a comfortable archbishop 's residence , he has lived in a small apartment outside @entity3 where he spends his weekends in solitude			2
in his rare public appearances , @entity2 spares no harsh words for politicians and @entity31 society , and has had a tricky relationship with president @entity219 and her late husband and predecessor , @entity222			1
president @entity219 shakes hands with @entity2 in @entity224 , @entity31 , when he was a cardinal			1
