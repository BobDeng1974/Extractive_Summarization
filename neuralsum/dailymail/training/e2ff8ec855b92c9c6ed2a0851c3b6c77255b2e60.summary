' baking and cake artistry is continuously growing in popularity so we wanted to break into the cake world with something a bit different - hence the dog cakes			0
' but we found that they were too niche , so we started @entity13 in april 2013			0
it meant there would be no restrictions to the kind of cakes we 'd be commissioned to do			0

' for large - scale cakes like the @entity116 ( 5ft ' life - size ' rainbow cake - filled shape ) and @entity120 we start with a scale drawing and then create a structure the cake to be built on			0
