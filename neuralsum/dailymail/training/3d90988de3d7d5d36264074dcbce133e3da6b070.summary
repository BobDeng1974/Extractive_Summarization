by @entity0 published : 20:52 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 03:39 est , 7 january 2014 at the very least , it 's one hairy issue less for @entity3 to discuss as he returns to the airwaves			2
the veteran @entity7 presenter 's beard made headlines when he debuted it on television last year			1
but , hours after declaring online that ' beards are so 2013 ' , he shunned his facial hair and returned to a clean - shaven look for his first appearance of the year on the show last night			1
the 63 - year - old 's beard divided opinion and sparked busy discussions on @entity20 when he first appeared with it last august			1
before and after : @entity3 sparked a @entity20 storm when he returned from his summer holiday last year sporting a full beard			2
he is pictured ( left ) with his ' gravitas adding ' facial hair and ( right ) all smooth again at the time @entity28 radio host @entity27 described him as a ' silly old goat '			2
the presenter hit back and accused his critics of pogonophobia â€“ an irrational fear of beards			0
before going on air last night mr @entity3 told @entity36 : ' if a chap ca n't shave on holiday , what can he do ? beards are so 2013			0
' @entity3 's appearance drew a huge response when he grew the beard more than five months ago , when he branded the @entity28 pogonophobic - having a fear of beards			1
at the time , he explained his reasons , saying : ' i have grown a beard for the last few summers , and suddenly wondered whether i really needed to shave it off to present @entity7			0
' unless you 're lucky enough to be @entity52 on @entity53 , @entity54 or @entity55 , the @entity28 is generally as pogonophobic as the late - lamented @entity57 dictator , @entity56			0
facial hair : @entity3 on @entity7 in november , ending the show with a good @entity61 ' tattoo ' on his hands no facial hair : @entity3 appears clean - shaven for the cameras ' i may keep it or i may shave it off , but i think i 'll make my own decision			1
' he later said : ' for a glorious few days i have been a poster boy for a shadowy group called the @entity72 , which claims that facial hair invites discrimination			0
' i 'm finding it quite a heavy burden			0
' the @entity72 has lamented the decision to go clean - shaven , saying : ' we support people 's right to dress and appear as they want so , while we regret @entity3 's decision to shave off his gravitas adding beard , the choice should be entirely up to him , @entity28 pogonophobia notwithstanding			1
