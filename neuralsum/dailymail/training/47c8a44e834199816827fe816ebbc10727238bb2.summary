although the city he documents is a far cry from the picture postcard version on sale to tourists in @entity64			1
his @entity3 is an underground haven for people at society ’s edges , who come alive at night to party in abandoned spaces , to make music and art and noise and mess			2
‘ i hope what happens is when you take in all these images and the subject matter and the aesthetic and you pile them together , you get a sense of this world that 's kind of swirling right underneath a lot of people ’s feet in @entity3 , ’ @entity6 told @entity75			2
he moved to the city to attend the @entity88 in 1997 and became immersed in @entity90 ’s burgeoning art and music scene			0

‘ some people may think that to do some of the stuff you see in the photos you have to have no job , never work			0
in fact , the opposite is true			0
' a lot of the people in the photos have day jobs , and this is what they do at night			0
it 's really about what you 're passionate about , what you do , what you like to make happen on your own , ’ he said			0
a lot of @entity6 's photographs involve a high degree of risk as safety is often questionable and the police are never too far away , but for @entity19 it is simply a matter of weighing risk and reward			2

many people will view @entity6 ’s adventures as things they simply would n’t dream of doing – or perhaps are too scared to try – but it is somehow reassuring to know that somewhere out there in the night there are people crowd surfing in high heels or playing in a mutant brass band			0
@entity6 's photographs prove that the city that never sleeps is still there , it 's just that if you want to find it you might need to look a bit harder and travel a bit further to the outer boroughs than some of those people so quick to say that @entity3 is n’t as good as it once was			1
@entity12 : photographs of another @entity3 by @entity6 is available to buy now			1
@entity6 's book documents the photographs he has taken over the past 15 years of a very different @entity3 to the one seen by most of its residents and visitors			2
