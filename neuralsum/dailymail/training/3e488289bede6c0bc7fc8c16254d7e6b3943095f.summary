a new study conducted in @entity1 could change the practices of ambulance services across @entity4 and even across the world			0
the incredible research has found that giving oxygen to a heart attack patient could actually cause them harm and could entice more heart attacks			1
the landmark study , which followed more than 400 patients treated by @entity15 's mobile intensive care ambulance paramedics , said providing oxygen offers no benefit at all and instead could cause further damage to the heart muscle			1
the new study has found that giving oxygen to heart attack patients could cause harm and entice more heart attacks the landmark study followed more than 400 patients treated by @entity15 's who had chest pain and evidence that they had sudden blockage to one of the heart arteries those who took part in the study had chest pain and evidence that they had sudden blockage to one of the heart arteries , with half treated with oxygen and the other without			1
‘ for more than 100 years , it has been routine practice across the world to give oxygen to people having a heart attack because it was thought this would be beneficial , ’ said the principal investigators , dr @entity41 from @entity15 and professor @entity42 from the @entity43			1
‘ more recently there have been questions about whether oxygen really helps , and uncertainty about what is the best treatment for patients			0
’ ‘ our data suggests that routine oxygen supplementation could cause greater harm for patients having a heart attack , ' they said			1
' the study found increased heart damage on mri scans at six months			0
’ while some hospitals and ambulance services , including @entity15 , have modified practices , it is still very common to give patients oxygen both in @entity4 and across the globe			2
the landmark study also found that those patients who were receiving oxygen could be more likely to have further heart attacks the study findings are likely to change practices for ambulance services across @entity4 and even across the world the surprising results from the study have just been released at one of the world ’s leading medical conferences , the annual @entity83 conference in @entity84			1
alarmingly it also showed those who were receiving oxygen could be more likely to have further heart attacks			2
co-researcher and @entity89 said there were several reasons for oxygen causing additional damage			0
‘ high - flow oxygen has been shown to narrow coronary arteries and reduce the heart ’s blood flow , as well as accelerate the production of harmful reactive oxygen molecules which increase heart inflammation and stress , ' he said			0
‘ this study is likely to change the practice of ambulance services in @entity4 and around the world , and is another example of @entity15 ’s research changing global practice to improve patient outcomes			2
' but mr @entity89 said providing oxygen was still appropriate for patients with low levels of oxygen in their blood			0
‘ these patients do need supplemental oxygen and were excluded from the trial			0

new landmark study discovers giving oxygen to a heart attack patient can cause harm
