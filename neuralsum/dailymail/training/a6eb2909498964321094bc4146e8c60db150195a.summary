the @entity0 flatly denied on wednesday a claim from a @entity3 congressman that the @entity5 terror army is quietly slipping into the @entity6 through its porous southern border – and that @entity6 border patrol agents have already captured ten of its soldiers			1
@entity12 @entity11 told a @entity14 audience on tuesday that @entity5 , the self - proclaimed @entity5 , is actively infiltrating the @entity6 ' i know that at least ten @entity5 fighters have been caught coming across the @entity18 border in @entity19 , ' he said			1
' there 's nobody talking about it			2
' but @entity0 fired back , saying in a statement that @entity11 's claim is ' categorically false			1
' @entity0 continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border			0
' @entity52 reported wednesday that one of @entity11 's sources ' nuanced their claims ' after the @entity14 broadcast , saying that some of the people he referred to may have been ' @entity5 - affiliated or possibly @entity6 who fought with the @entity59			1
' the @entity59 is an @entity5 foe , not an ally			2
@entity11 's spokesman pushed back , defending his claim			2
“ the congressman was conveying what he knows – and what he was told , ' the spokesperson said in a statement			2
' it makes sense that the left hand of @entity0 does n’t know what the right hand is doing – it ’s been that way for a long time and we do n’t expect that to change			0
' @entity11 , like many in the @entity12 , has advocated in the past for strengthening @entity6 's border security to the south , a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the @entity85 presidency			1
during a 2013 @entity88 hearing , then - @entity0 secretary @entity86 said that due to the administration 's ' significant progress and efforts ... our borders have , in fact , never been stronger			2
' but @entity11 , a member of the @entity94 , claimed tuesday that the nation 's 1,933 - mile southern border represents @entity5 's best hope of waging war on the @entity6 ' if you really want to protect @entity6 from @entity5 , you secure the southern border , ' he said			1
' it 's that simple			0
' ' @entity5 does n't have a navy , they do n't have an air force , they do n't have nuclear weapons			2
the only way that @entity5 is going to harm @entity6 is by coming in through the southern border – which they already have			1
' ' you 're talking about our southern border ? ' @entity14 host @entity108 can @entity107 was shocked to hear @entity11 's claim that @entity5 is infiltrating the @entity6 host @entity114 was caught flat - footed			1
' are you talking about ours ? ' she asked			0
' you 're talking about our southern border ? you 're not talking about the southern border of @entity118 ? ' ' they are n't flying b - 1 bombers , bombing @entity6 cities , ' he replied , ' but they are going to be bombing @entity6 cities coming across from @entity33			1
' the three - term congressman cited a similar fear that @entity127 chairman gen. @entity126 expressed during an august 21 @entity129 press briefing			0
@entity126 called @entity5 ' an immediate threat ... because of open borders and immigration issues			0
' @entity11 said his information came directly from @entity134 , which has a 20,000 - strong army of agents patrolling the borders in @entity19 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity3			0
' i 've asked the border patrol , ' he said , adding that he was told about the ten @entity5 fighters who were caught crossing the border			1
' if they catch five or ten of them , then you know there 's gon na be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol , ' he said			0
' but that 's how you know : all you have to do is ask the border patrol			0
' the government watchdog group @entity154 claimed in august that @entity5 terrorists were ' planning to attack the @entity6 with car bombs or other vehicle born [ sic ] improvised explosive devices			1
' the group said a ' warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack ' had been issued to ' agents across a number of @entity0 , @entity164 and defense agencies , ' instructing them ' to aggressively work all possible leads and sources ' to prevent the attacks			0
the @entity0 flatly denied that in a statement to @entity170			0
' we are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim , ' a bewildered @entity0 spokesman said ' in @entity33 ? i have n't seen that at all			0
' homeland security secretary @entity177 said on the same day @entity154 made its claims that his agency and the @entity180 were ' unaware of any specific , credible threat to the @entity6 homeland ' from the terror network .			1

@entity12 rep. @entity11 said tuesday that the @entity35 told him about @entity187 terror group 's members slipping into the @entity6
' the only way that @entity5 is going to harm @entity6 , ' he said , ' is by coming in through the southern border – which they already have '
a shocked @entity14 host asked , ' you 're talking about our southern border ? '
another congressman claimed last month that the @entity180 is watching *40* @entity6 who have come back to the @entity6 after fighting for @entity5
@entity85 administration denied in august that @entity5 terrorists were *massing* in @entity202 , @entity33 with plans for car bomb attacks in @entity6
