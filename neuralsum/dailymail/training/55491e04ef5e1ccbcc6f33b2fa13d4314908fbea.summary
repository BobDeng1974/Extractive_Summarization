by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 4 july 2013 a professor at @entity2 is suing @entity3 for patent infringement and is calling for the products to be banned in the @entity6 lecturer @entity7 claims he designed the thin gallium nitride film that @entity3 uses on the semiconductor chips inside its @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 in 1995			1
he is now also seeking financial damages from the tech firm			1
a professor at @entity2 is suing @entity3 for patent infringement			1
the lecturer claims he designed the thin gallium nitride films used on the semiconductor chips inside the @entity10 , pictured , @entity11 and @entity12 in 1995 and wants the products banned in the @entity6 he is also seeking financial damages @entity22 ( @entity22 ) is a semiconductor material that can stand high levels of heat and thermal conductivity			1
electricity can be passed through semiconductor materials from one place to another			0
this is why it is used in semiconductor chips in phones , tablets and laptops			1
in its pure form , @entity22 resists cracking and can be used as a thin film on top of various materials			0
the lawsuit , filed by professor of electrical computing and engineering at the university on 2 july , said : ' several of the @entity47 's products , including the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 include a gallium nitride thin film semiconductor device claimed by the ' 738 patent and thus infringe one or more claims the of the ' 738 patent			1
' it asks that the ' defendant provide to the @entity2 an accounting of all gains , profits andadvantages derived by @entity47 ' s infringement of the ' 738 patent , and that the @entity2 beawarded damages adequate to compensate them for the wrongful infringement			2
' @entity7 and the university also want to be ' awarded any other supplemental damages and interest onall damages , including , but not limited to attorney fees			0
' plus , the university asks that the court bans @entity3 from ' making , selling , offering for sale , distributing and / or using prodcuts that infringe the patent ' across the whole of @entity6			2
the professor claims he invented the film in 1995 and the ' 738 patent was filed in november 1997			1
the patent , called ' highly insulating monocrystalline gallium nitride thin films ' describes the method used to make these thin films and lists some of the uses for them			0
this includes using the films as a semiconductor material in devices			0
this image is a cross-sectional view of a growth chamber used to create the gallium nitride films			0
professor @entity7 patented the process behind the chips in 1997 and claims @entity3 ripped off his designs last month a court in the @entity6 banned the sale @entity3 products - including the @entity89 and the @entity11 and @entity11 3g models after an official ruling claimed the devices breach @entity94 patents			1
@entity3 was given 60 days to stop selling the products but is appealing the decision , which ruled that @entity3 copied @entity94 's 3g technology in its devices			2
in 2011 a group of nearly 27,000 @entity100 sued @entity3 for £ 15.8million over what they claim were ' privacy violations ' from the collection of @entity10 user location information			2
each person in the suit sought one million won ( £ 568 ) in damages ,			0
at the time , the groups attorney @entity109 said they were targeting @entity3 and its @entity100 unit to ' protect privacy ' rights			0
the @entity100 government had previously fined the company £ 1800 for privacy infringement .			0

professor claims he invented the film used on semiconductor chips in 1995
@entity3 uses a *similar* film on chips in its @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12
@entity2 wants the products banned and financial damages
