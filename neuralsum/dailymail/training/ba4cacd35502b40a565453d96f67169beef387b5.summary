the images were created by flying a drone fitted with lights around in front of a long exposure picture			1
@entity25 be dragons ! photoshop was also used to modify the light patterns , allowing the perfectly symetrical images to be built from the flight patterns the team bought coloured lights from @entity33 and strapped them to a @entity35 quadcopter			1
