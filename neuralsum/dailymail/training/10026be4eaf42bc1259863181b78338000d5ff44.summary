by @entity1 reporter published : 13:07 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 13:07 est , 8 july 2013 the 2 - year - old girl who was the youngest person to ever receive a bio-engineered organ has died two months after doctors implanted her with a new windpipe			1
@entity6 was born without a windpipe and underwent an experimental procedure to be implanted with one made from stem cells			1
the procedure took place on april 9 , and the spokesman for the @entity13 of @entity14 announced that she died on saturday			1
new windpipe : in this april 26 , 2013 photo provided by @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity14 , @entity6 , 2 , lies in bed in a post-op room at the @entity17 in @entity18 , after having received a new windpipe the hospital says in a statement that @entity6 could n't ' overcome additional health issues that were identified as her care progressed			1
' the stem cells came from @entity6 's bone marrow , extracted with a special needle inserted into her hip bone			1
they were seeded in a lab onto a plastic scaffold , where it took a few days for them to multiply and create a new windpipe			0
@entity6 was born in @entity36 and traveled to @entity14 for the surgery			2
her family has asked for privacy			0
brave : the little girl is recovering with her parents , left , after the nine - hour surgery on april 9 @entity6 was unable to breathe , eat , drink or swallow on her own since she was born in @entity36 in 2010			1
until the april 9 operation at the @entity13 of @entity14 , the toddler had spent her entire life in a hospital in @entity48			2
doctors there told her parents there was no hope and they expected her to die			0
the stem cells came from @entity6 's bone marrow , extracted with a special needle inserted into her hip bone			1
they were seeded in a lab onto a plastic scaffold , where it took less than a week for them to multiply and create a new windpipe			2
about the size of a 3 - inch tube of penne pasta , it was implanted in a nine - hour procedure			0
early signs indicate the windpipe showed it as working , but she remained on a ventilator for weeks following the procedure			0
miracle : @entity6 , 2 , pictured with her parents @entity74 - mi and @entity75 at @entity76 in @entity48 , @entity36 , piror to the breakthrough surgery only about one in 50,000 children worldwide are born with the windpipe defect			2
the stem - cell technique has been used to make other body parts besides windpipes and holds promise for treating other birth defects and childhood diseases , her doctors said			0
the operation brought together an @entity89 surgeon based in @entity90 who pioneered the technique , a pediatric surgeon at @entity17 in @entity18 who met @entity6 's family while on a business trip to @entity36 , and @entity6 — born to a @entity97 man and @entity36 woman who married after he moved to that country to teach @entity100			1
@entity6 's parents had read about dr. @entity103 's success using stem - cell based tracheas but could n't afford to pay for the operation at his center , the @entity108 in @entity109			1
breakthrough : surgeons perform a landmark windpipe transplant operation on @entity6 , 2 , at @entity17 in @entity18 on april 9 , 2013 so dr. @entity113 helped the family arrange to have the procedure at his @entity18 hospital , bringing in @entity103 to lead the operation			1
@entity13 waived the cost , likely hundreds of thousands of dollars , @entity113 said			0
part of @entity17 , the @entity121 hospital considers the operation part of their mission to provide charity care , but also views it as a way to champion a type of stem - cell therapy that does n't involve human embryos , the surgeons said			0
the @entity121 opposes using stem cells derived from human embryos in research or treatment			2
@entity103 has been involved in 14 previous windpipe operations using patients ' own stem cells — five using man - made scaffolds like @entity6 's but in adults ; and nine using scaffolds made from cadaver windpipes , including one in a 10 - year - old @entity144 boy			1
tears of joy : @entity75 and his wife , @entity148 , tearfully stand on tuesday april 30 , 2013 , after being introduced at a press conference in at @entity13 of @entity14 , in @entity18 , @entity14 doctors : dr. @entity103 , center , holds a replica of a windpipe like that implanted in little @entity6 at a news conference today he said only one patient died , a 30 - year - old man from @entity158 , @entity159 , who had the operation in november 2011 to treat late - stage cancer of the windpipe			1
he died about four months later of uncertain causes , @entity103 said			0
similar methods have been used to grow bladders , urethras and last year a girl in @entity90 got a lab - made vein using her own stem cells and a cadaver vein			2
scientists hope to eventually use the method to create solid organs , including kidneys and livers , said dr. @entity177 , director of @entity179 's @entity178			0
he said the operation on @entity6 ' is really showing that the technique is workable			0
' @entity6 had breathing difficulties at birth and @entity36 doctors soon discovered the missing windpipe			2
they reconfigured her esophagus so that a breathing tube could go down it from her mouth to her lungs			0
the esophagus normally runs behind the windpipe and carries food to the stomach .			0

@entity6 was born without a windpipe in 2010 and was unable to breathe , eat , drink or swallow on her own since birth
stem cells from @entity6 's bone marrow took less than a week to multiply and were created into the windpipe
@entity202 implanted the new windpipe on april 9 but she died almost two months later on july 6
doctors say it was *due* to ' additional health issues '
