' ( i have ) many feelings together			0
what happened on the pitch , with the fans , will remain forever etched on me and i could not help but mourn ( his departure ) because i did not expect it			0
' first came the parting with colleagues , then with the fans ... all very complicated			0
@entity4 are a great team and of course i 'm super-motivated			2
i hope things go well			0
' @entity0 's arrival will be @entity4 's eighth summer signing , although @entity73 striker @entity72 has immediately returned to former club @entity74 on loan			1

' i had talks with the coach , who clearly indicated that i was part of his plans			0
i feel good physically and at 33 years of age i am ready for any challenge			0
' i continue to work hard in training to keep up the momentum and it is why the coach wants to keep me at @entity4 , because i am a fighter			2
' i intend to start the season with the same goals : to enable the club to progress and to please all fans of @entity4			2

' at the other end of the scale @entity80 has been impressed by the progress made by 19 - year - old @entity94 , who has carried on the impressive performances of the previous campaign into @entity4 's pre-season games			1
' something we said to @entity94 when he first broke into the team and we 've reiterated is that you have to have an identity as a player , ' @entity80 told liverpoolfc.com			2
room to improve : @entity80 wants @entity94 ( left ) to add more goals to his game new season , new challenge : @entity80 will be hoping his team can go one better this season ' his identity is he has to score goals and create goals			1
that 's what the job is			0
he scored 10 goals last year and this kid is only going to get better			0
' when you look at the finish against @entity212 in @entity213 , how many times have we seen [ @entity214 ] @entity214 produce a touch like that , taking it through bodies when it 's so tight in the box ? ' the great thing with watching him now is that he gets you off your seat			0
when he gets the ball you think : " something could happen here "			0
' he 's taking it all in his stride and now he 's in a good place with every part of his game			0
