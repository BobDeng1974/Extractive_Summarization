celebrity chef @entity0 turned on the health secretary today and told him his new plan to improve hospital meals ' is going to do nothing '			1
the @entity7 presenter , a hospital food standards campaigner , also said he has tried persistently to set up meetings with @entity10 but the minister is always ' too busy '			1
it came as disgruntled patients sent pictures to @entity15 of hospital meals they considered ' pitiful ' and ' disgusting '			2
@entity10 has ordered a review into hospital food , asking @entity20 trusts to meet specific standards and threatening fines for the worst offenders , but chef @entity0 said today ' it will do nothing ' hospital canteens have been blasted for serving unhealthy options such as pie and chips and the health secretary says trusts will be forced to overhaul their menus today the health secretary announced new rules to ensure hospitals improve their food or face fines , and made it compulsory for trusts to serve meals that meet basic standards and ensure staff help patients to eat them			1
he ordered trusts to overhaul canteen food so healthier options are available rather than burgers , chips and pies and stop salt being added to vegetables			1
but @entity0 accused mr @entity10 of not thinking through his proposals			1
he wrote on @entity51 : ' for 5 years i 've worked in hospitals all over the country and this idea is going to do nothing			0
' providing tap water is brilliant one ... though that must 've taken a lot of thought '			0
urging mr @entity10 to meet with him he said : ' i 'm here if you want me to help and will be available anytime , 7 days a wk as you 're office says you 're " too busy " all the time			1
' i 'm here from now until the election '			0
@entity10 has vowed to raise food standards in @entity20 hospitals and visited the @entity66 in @entity67 today to see how their meals are made @entity71 ( right , with @entity10 ) said : ‘ getting hospital food and drink right is critical ... no hospital can afford to neglect this ’ pictures have emerged of substandard food in hospitals , including this cheese and tomato sandwich yesterday the @entity78 published shocking photographs of hospital food sent in by patients including congealed rice pudding and soggy broccoli			1
others were served chicken pie with raw pastry , mince burned on to the plate and , in one case , a half bowl of tomato soup and salad			0
dieticians said the meals were either so unappetising or meagre that they hindered patients ’ recovery because they would not get enough nutrients			2
but starting from december , a basic set of standards governing hospital food will be written in to each trust ’s @entity20 contract			1
these include checking patients for malnutrition when they are admitted and ensuring they are given enough help at mealtimes by nursing staff			0
trusts will also have to provide fresh fruit and offer healthy options at canteens that are low in sugar , salt and fat			2
from today patients will be able to see how the food was rated on the @entity20 choices website standards will be monitored by the @entity118 as part of routine hospital inspections			1
if a trust breaches these standards they could be fined by the local gp - led @entity124			0
from today patients will also be able to see how their local hospital has been rated for food on the @entity130 website			2
each trust has been given a score out of 100 for quality and choice and the website also states whether they provide fresh fruit and food between meals			1
mr @entity10 said : ‘ we are making the @entity20 more transparent , giving patients the power to compare food and incentivising hospitals to raise their game			1
‘ many hospitals are already offering excellent food			0
but we want to know that all patients have nourishing and appetising food to help them get well faster and stay healthy , which is why we ’re introducing tough new mandatory standards for the first time ever			2
’ but @entity152 , of the @entity153 , said the new measures were ‘ woefully inadequate ’			0
he pointed out the standards which hospitals were required to meet were very basic , including that they provide tap water			0
he said : ‘ we ’re left feeling that he has pulled the wool over our eyes			0
we want to see hospital food standards set down in legislation , similarly to school food standards			2
‘ but the government still refuses to do this and has only committed to including the standards in @entity20 commissioning contracts , which are long documents full of clauses that without proper enforcement and monitoring can be ignored			1
’ @entity172 , chairman of @entity173 , which led the review of hospital food , said : ‘ getting hospital food and drink right is critical and should also be considered an important part of someone ’s medical care			0
no hospital can afford to neglect this			0
’ the @entity20 in @entity183 receives 480 written complaints a day , with hospital doctors and surgeons among those bearing the brunt of patients ’ frustrations			1
there were almost 175,000 complaints in 2013/14 – 3,300 a week – according to the @entity193			0
