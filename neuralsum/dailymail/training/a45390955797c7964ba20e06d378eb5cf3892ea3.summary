by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:49 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 13:09 est , 13 june 2012 @entity4 chief executive @entity3 defended the intent of the portfolio behind the bank 's recent multibillion - dollar trading loss , telling lawmakers it was a genuine hedge that would make the firm a lot of money if a credit crisis hit			1
@entity3 , appearing before the @entity15 on wednesday , said well - intentioned traders poorly executed the hedge , and the bank 's senior management failed to police the @entity21 office behind the trades			1
lawmakers have questioned whether the trades , that have yielded more than $ 2billion in losses so far , were truly a hedge or a speculative bet that was hidden from shareholders and regulators			0
good intent : @entity3 , chairman of the board , president and ceo of @entity4 testifies before a @entity15 , @entity33 hearing today greed : a protester , right , screams at @entity3 as he testifies at the hearing ; around a dozen people were escorted from the hearing ' this particular synthetic credit portfolio was intended to earn a lot of revenue if there was a crisis			1
i consider that a hedge , ' @entity3 said			1
' what it morphed into , i will not try to defend			0
' @entity3 , under close questioning about his role in setting up the investment division of the bank responsible for the loss , declared : ' we made a mistake			1
the buck stops with me			0
' @entity3 's highly anticipated appearance before lawmakers got off to a rocky start with multiple protesters disrupting the event			1
the protests started with one man yelling out ' @entity3 is a crook ' as @entity3 approached the witness table			0
@entity3 , dressed in a conservative navy suit , appeared unperturbed by the barrage of insults			0
another group of protesters then started chanting , ' stop foreclosures now ' before they were escorted out of the cavernous hearing room			0
the trading loss has heightened concerns that the biggest banks still pose risks to the @entity73 financial system , less than four years after the financial crisis in the fall of 2008			1
two democrats on the committee , sens. @entity78 of @entity79 and @entity80 of @entity81 , expressed concern about what would have happened if the trading loss had occurred at a weaker bank			1
media storm : members of the press surround @entity3 as he prepared to testify @entity4 is the largest bank in the @entity73 by assets and is considered among the strongest			1
@entity3 often makes note of the bank 's ' fortress balance sheet			1
' but @entity80 hypothesized about a larger loss , perhaps $ 50 billion , that creates a run on the bank ' and that ultimately becomes the collective responsibility of each and every @entity73			0
' @entity80 also challenged @entity3 on his strenuous opposition to stricter financial regulation and noted that @entity4 received a $ 20 billion taxpayer bailout at the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008			1
@entity3 said repeatedly that the bank 's senior management failed by not detecting the @entity21 office 's spike in risk , and said the bank will consider taking back pay from certain executives once the banks ' board is done with their review			2
' i would say it 's likely ... there will be claw backs , ' @entity3 said			2
@entity3 revealed during a surprise conference call last month that a hedging strategy in its @entity21 office had gone awry , producing at least $ 2 billion , and possibly $ 3billion , in trading losses			2
that was after @entity3 in april dismissed as a ' tempest in a teapot ' news reports that a ' @entity127 ' in that office had amassed an outsized position that prompted hedge funds to bet against it			2
@entity3 said he made that statement after attorneys and others told him they thought any problems in the @entity136 were an isolated , small issue			0
on guard : an @entity140 officer stood guard the entrance to the @entity142 in @entity79 last month as an investigation was carried out ' when i made that statement , i was dead wrong , ' @entity3 said			0
the so - called @entity147 rule , which goes into effect in july , will prevent banks from making certain trades for their own profit			0
banks won an exemption to trade to protect their broad portfolios , as @entity3 has said @entity4 was doing in this case			1
@entity3 told the committee , however , that ' i have a hard time distinguishing it			0
' he allowed that ' it 's possible ' that the @entity147 rule would have prevented the debacle at @entity4 but said he did n't know			2
the ceo said that @entity4 adopted a strategy late last year to reduce risk , but it backfired in its investment operation by heightening risk instead			2
the bank has named a new leader for the investment operation that was responsible for the loss .			0

@entity4 ceo @entity3 testifying today over *company* 's *multi-billion* trading loss
said it was well - intentioned by traders but poorly executed by hedge
