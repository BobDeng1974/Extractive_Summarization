by @entity0 the number of @entity5 troops in @entity6 may drop well below 10,000 - the minimum demanded by the @entity5 military to train @entity10 forces - as the longest war in @entity5 history winds down , @entity2 administration officials briefed on the matter @entity6 's general election on april 5 , @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity18 officials have resumed discussions on how many @entity5 troops should remain after the current @entity5 - led coalition ends its mission this year.the decision to consider a small force , possibly less than 5,000 @entity5 troops , reflects a belief among @entity15 officials that @entity10 security forces have evolved into a robust enough force to contain a still - potent @entity31 - led insurgency			1
the small @entity5 force that would remain could focus on counter-terrorism or training operations			0
@entity36 soldiers may gradually begin leaving @entity6 until there are as low as 5,000 soldiers left that belief , the officials say , is based partly on @entity6 's surprisingly smooth election , which has won international praise for its high turnout , estimated at 60 percent of 12 million eligible votes , and the failure of @entity31 militants to stage high - profile attacks that @entity49 @entity2 administration has been looking at options for a possible residual @entity5 force for months			2
' the discussion is very much alive , ' said one @entity5 official who asked not to be identified			0
' they 're looking for additional options under 10,000 ' troops			0
' there are now about 33,000 @entity5 troops in @entity6 , down from 100,000 in 2011 , when troop numbers peaked a decade into a conflict originally intended to deny @entity61 sanctuary in @entity6 after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
with @entity66 and other foreign troops scheduled to depart in lock step with @entity5 soldiers , the size of any residual @entity5 force could add fuel to a debate in @entity71 over whether @entity31 - led violence will intensify amid the vacuum left by @entity75 forces , as some @entity5 military officials expect			1
military leaders , including @entity5 general @entity78 , who heads @entity5 and @entity80 forces in @entity6 , has identified 10,000 soldiers as the minimum needed to help train and advise @entity10 forces fighting the insurgency , arguing a smaller force would struggle to protect itself			1
during a march visit to @entity71 , @entity78 told lawmakers that without foreign soldiers supporting them , @entity10 forces would begin to deteriorate " fairly quickly " in 2015			2
the @entity10 air force , still several years away from being self - sufficient , will require even more assistance , he said			0
a smaller @entity5 force could have other unintended consequences , possibly discouraging already skeptical lawmakers from fully funding @entity5 commitments to help fund @entity10 forces			2
ever since @entity6 's smooth april 5 election , officials believe that the @entity10 troops may be able to contain the @entity31 themselves at their current size , @entity10 forces will cost at least $ 5 billion in 2015 , a sum far beyond the reach of the @entity10 government			1
the @entity5 has been widely expected to be the largest outside funder for those forces			0
the @entity31 and other militants have been weakened by more than 12 years of @entity10 and @entity80 assaults , but they still can obtain supplies and plan attacks from @entity6 's remote mountain regions and tribal areas of neighboring @entity114 analysts are wary of reducing the @entity5 presence to less than 10,000 troops			1
" if the @entity15 opts to keep a lower number of troops , it will put more pressure on the @entity10 forces and run the risk of squandering their recent progress against the @entity31 , ' said @entity124 , a former @entity125 analyst and @entity17 official now with the conservative @entity127 , a think tank in @entity71			2
there are now about 33,000 @entity5 troops in @entity6 , down from 100,000 in 2011 a @entity5 force significantly below 10,000 might focus almost exclusively on counter-terrorism , tracking militants affiliated with a greatly weakened but resilient @entity61 insurgency based on the @entity6 - @entity139 border , officials @entity135 over the size of a residual @entity5 force follows the failure of the @entity5 and @entity10 governments to finalize a @entity144 ( @entity145 ) to authorize a @entity5 troop presence in @entity6 beyond 2014 , the deadline for @entity5 and @entity80 troops to conclude their fight against the @entity31			1
' the longer we go without a @entity145 , the more challenging it will be to plan and execute any @entity5 mission , ' said @entity150 , a @entity15 spokeswoman			0
' furthermore , the longer we go without a @entity145 , the more likely it will be that any post- 2014 @entity5 mission will be smaller in scale and ambition			0
' results of the recent presidential election may not be known for weeks , or months if runoffs take place			0
but leading candidates have said they will sign the agreement , which has been on hold because of reservations from current @entity10 president @entity162			0
in late february , @entity2 announced that the @entity5 might seek to sign the deal with @entity162 's successor and possibly keep troops there after 2014 to train and advise @entity10 forces and pursue @entity61 militants			2
some @entity5 officials believe @entity10 forces will require substantial , hands - on support from foreign troops , in addition to help from the @entity5 .			1
