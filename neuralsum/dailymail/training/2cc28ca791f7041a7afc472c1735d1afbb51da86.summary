a violent man has been caught on @entity1 attacking estate agent staff in a row over a £ 100 deposit despite never having been a customer at the branch			1
three women were left terrified when the unknown man burst into @entity10 letting agents in @entity11 , @entity12 and shouted and screamed obscenities at them before throwing everything off one of the desks			1
the same man is also said to have shouted at workers at a different branch two weeks earlier , with staff reporting both incidents to the police and sending them @entity1 footage of the incident			1
@entity41 , who runs the agency said the enraged man is not a client and believes he has mistaken his business with another firm the man has an ongoing complaint with			2
he said that since the attacks , his staff have now resorted to keeping the door locked and fear the man could come back , possibly with a weapon			1
he explained : ' he used a lot of swear words but in between those he seemed to have a beef that someone had stolen his £ 100 deposit			1
the then starts pointing as his aggressive rant in the office in @entity11 continues the whole incident was captured on the shop 's cctv cameras but despite informing the police , they are yet to respond to the complaint ' he 's obviously got muddled up in some way			1
none of the staff recognised him			2
' the first incident there were five fairly robust gentlemen there and he quickly darted out the door			2
' the second incident happened at an office containing three female employees			2
' we 've got perfect cctv footage but the police are n't even interested in that			2
' my fear is that everything could escalate if the police do n't deal with it and caution him			0
' next time he might come in with a knife			0
what 's the point of the police dealing with it then when i 've got a fatality on my hands ? after ranting at the staff over a £ 100 deposit , the man then leans forward towards one staff member 's desk he then throws all of the items off desk as the three female staff members look on in horror ' people like that need to be cautioned to prevent a much larger action in the future			1
' i emailed the police four times , which we still have n't had a response to , and we also called			0
the staff called at least five times and i called four or five times as well			0
' we have the doors locked on a permanent basis now and i 'm having to install specialist buttons on the desks so staff can buzz people they recognise in			1
' but it 's not the image you want of the trade			0
it 's just not right			0
' i 've done everything i can for the security of my staff			0
in my other shop there 's five different camera positions			0
it might seem over the top for a shop that does n't handle cash but i 've done that for my staff			0
after the rant , the man walks out of the shop			0
it is believed his complaint is with another letting agents in the area ' i 've bought expensive cctv so the footage can be passed on to the police and investigated but half my plan seems to be falling down			1
' inspector @entity150 , of @entity12 police , explained that the incident had wrongly been down - graded by staff which is why it was not immediately investigated			1
he said : ' an officer did call back to explain that we were unable to attend straight away and that someone would be round as soon as possible			0
' the incident was mistakenly then reclassified as a lower priority which resulted in a slow response due to officer availability and the number of incidents that had been classified at a higher priority level			0
' we clearly let them down on this occasion and i would like to apologise to mr @entity41 and staff at the two addresses for any distress this has caused			1
