face to face for the very first time with the man who had killed her son , @entity0 was not gripped by anger in the @entity7 court , but by overwhelming sadness			1
because as she stared at @entity10 , 20 , at his august 2012 bond hearing , it dawned on @entity12 that the young man who mowed down her son in a hit and run felt exactly the same way			1
but what neither of them knew at that moment was that they were to embark on a powerful journey of forgiveness that would eventually lead to @entity10 coming to call @entity0 ' mom ' salvation : @entity10 , 21 , was imprisoned for the july 12th , 2012 fatal motorcycle accident in @entity7 which killed @entity27 and was offered forgiveness by his mother @entity0 @entity10 was sentenced to two years in prison in november for the july 12th incident in @entity7 , which left motorcyclist @entity27 , 36 , fatally wounded on the road			1
he still remembers the words of @entity34 's father , @entity33 as he told him , ' you were at the scene of the accident and you basically left my son there to rot and die			2
' as the judge ordered him to spend the next two years behind bars , @entity0 broke down in tears on the witness stand			2
but as she held up a picture of her son and his dog @entity49 , she noticed that @entity10 too , had broken down			1
during the trial she learned that @entity10 had been in and out of foster care and had little contact with the criminal justice system			2
she heard how he cared for his dying mother when he came out of care at the age of 16 and how two weeks before his 18th birthday she died from a heart attack with @entity10 by her side			2
his sister told the court that her brother was the victim of a terrible childhood in care and suffered physical and sexual abuse			0
@entity0 told the @entity66 that @entity10 's world , was one she has ' never been familiar with			1
' ' i ’ve never been a young , black , underprivileged individual in the inner city , ' she said			0
' this situation opened my eyes and world to something i ’ve never experienced			0
i began to really understand and realize the need and the opportunity to , maybe , just help one person			0
' however , what occurred at his sentencing stunned @entity10 as @entity0 walked over and said that she would like to stay in contact with him while he served his sentence			1
she said that it was her wish to help him get back on his feet			0
' i was kind of shocked , ' said @entity10 to the @entity66 ' i did n’t really understand why somebody would want to stay in contact with me			0
i thought it was kind of weird			0
' imprisoned : @entity10 is visited by @entity0 at @entity87 in @entity7 where he serving his sentence for the hit and run of her son @entity33 however , as @entity10 was being led out , @entity34 said , ' i 'll talk to you like a mama , is that ok ? ' ' yes ma'am , ' replied @entity10			1
just three days later , the victim 's advocate at the @entity96 received an email from @entity98 asking how to write letters to @entity10			1
' the true remorse that @entity10 displayed that day was heartbreaking for everyone there , ' she wrote			0
' you ca n’t fake what he went through			0
this young man has lived through hell growing up and it ’s only going to get worse in the @entity108 ' and for sure , we want to send @entity10 letters of encouragement and support			1
someone has to start making a difference in his life so that he can see life is worth living			0
' it was on the evening of july 12th that @entity0 's son @entity33 was riding his motorcycle through @entity121 , @entity122 when the 36 - year - old it project manager in @entity7 careered into the car @entity10 was driving			1
@entity10 had been drinking , upset that his boyfriend had cheated on him and was driving without a license for his friend who did not feel well			2
the the immediate aftermath of the crash , @entity10 pulled over and exited the vehicle to witness @entity27 try to reach for his cellphone as he lay on his back			1
@entity10 told the @entity66 that for a brief moment their eyes met			2
' if i stayed , ' @entity10 said			0
' i knew they would lock me up			0
' a cross dresser , @entity10 told the @entity66 that he was fearful of the consequences for himself in prison			2
' i was scared of me being gay , ' he said			0
' of somebody raping me or probably just doing something to me			0
' so he ran and spent the next six days on the run - playing a game of phone - tag with the police who had tracked him down after they found his friend and the car they drove away from the scene			0
grief stricken by their son 's death , @entity0 said that his arrest brought her only relief that he would n't do it again			2
indeed , the next day when her son 's killer 's mugshot appeared on a news website , the emotional impact was small			0
in fact , the picture caption only read , ' a young black man in a mugshot			0
' scene of the tragedy : intersection of 12th and @entity171 in @entity7 - where @entity10 smashed into @entity27 and left him for dead @entity0 could not have predicted that four months later she would be about to exchange life - changing letters with the young man who killed her son and ran away			1
explaining why she began sending the letters , @entity0 said that she could n't bear the thought of two lives going to waste			2
' my son is dead and somebody else 's son is going to be penalized			0
all of this for nothing , ' she explained to @entity184 writing her first letter in december , @entity0 told @entity10 about her family , about her son @entity33			1
two weeks later she received the first apologetic reply from @entity10			0
' if i could give my life and bring your son back , i would , ' wrote @entity10 to @entity0			1
encouraging him to spend his time behind bars gaining a high school diploma , @entity0 even sent @entity10 a photograph of her family from @entity197			1
' it might be really hard for you to understand that someone you do n’t know can care , but we do and we want you to know that , ' wrote @entity0			0
as @entity10 slowly opened up , he told @entity0 about his abusive childhood and of his dreams to be a model			1
and then @entity10 asked her if she would mind terribly if he called her ' @entity205 '			2
' it feels like you are more like my mom than anyone i ’ve known since my mom died , ' @entity0 recalled @entity10 saying in one of his letters to the @entity184 ' i feel like i can call you @entity205			1
' in fact , @entity0 now signs off her letters as ' @entity216 ' , which is what her dead son used to call her			1
in february , @entity10 was visited by @entity0 and even pays a little money into his prison account so that he can buy snacks and toiletries			1
when he is released next may , @entity216 and @entity224 hope to set up job training for @entity10			1
' i hope and pray that the bond we have formed helps him in some way to see himself as a valuable human being and that someone loves and cares for him versus the world taking advantage of him , ' @entity0 said .			0

@entity10 , 20 , was drink driving on july 12th 2012 , when he hit @entity27 , 36 , and fled the scene
@entity0 , a @entity237 minister , was overcome with emotion when she first laid eyes on her sons killer in court
@entity0 offered him forgiveness for his actions that evening
she now exchanges letters and visits him in prison and allows him to call him ' @entity216 ' - the name her son called her
