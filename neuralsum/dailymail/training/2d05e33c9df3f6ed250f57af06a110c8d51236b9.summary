by @entity0 a sick toddler died in hospital after he was denied a potentially life - saving test because it was ‘ not normally done ’ at weekends , an inquest heard yesterday			1
doctors did not give two - year - old @entity6 a test for heart disease			1
they said he showed no symptoms of heart failure and they believed he was suffering from a virus			0
but the toddler later died after suffering three cardiac arrests in hospital			0
@entity6 died in @entity15 ( pictured ) , @entity16 , west @entity17 , on may 13 last year after suffering three cardiac arrests an expert said his treatment would have been different if the echocardiogram ( @entity22 ) test had been given			1
it would have revealed @entity6 ’s underlying heart problem and would have meant he was given a different drug			1
but his consultant paediatrician , dr @entity26 , told the inquest the test ‘ was not done because it was the weekend and they are not normally done at the weekend ’			1
and dr @entity30 , the heart specialist who said @entity6 ’s treatment would have been different if the @entity22 had been given , also said there was no clinical evidence at the time to suggest the toddler needed this test			1
coroner @entity39 said @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , had not failed and said @entity6 was treated ‘ appropriately ’			1
as attempts were made to resuscitate the toddler , his parents were not allowed into the room with him but his family said ‘ big mistakes ’ were made and blamed out - of - hours shortages			2
after the inquest , his grandfather , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ the whole @entity48 just closes up shop at 5pm on friday and does n’t open up again until monday morning			0
it is disgraceful : do n’t get sick at the weekend			0
@entity6 was admitted to @entity15 with breathing difficulties and cold - like symptoms on wednesday , may 9 last year			1
he was vomiting and his heart was beating quickly but staff thought he was suffering from a virus and did not give him an @entity22 test , which uses soundwaves to create a picture of the heart			2
he had an underlying muscle condition which was diagnosed from his birth and had undergone an @entity22 a year earlier			2
@entity62 heard that another ecg after his admission at @entity15 would probably have revealed the new problem in his heart			2
@entity65 , the hospital 's matron and nursing services manager , apologised to @entity6 's parents , saying one reason they were excluded was because of staff shortages but it was not performed and by the time doctors realised his condition was critical – four days after his admission – he was suffering heart failure			1
by the saturday , the day before he died , his heart was racing and his eyes were puffy , which can be a symptom of an underlying heart problem			2
but he was still playing in his cot and showed no signs of heart failure			0
dr @entity26 said : ‘ the following day [ sunday ] when i came in to see him , he looked very unwell			0
his liver was enlarged and his heart rate was very high			0
it was then i realised something needed to be done urgently			0
’ dr @entity26 tried to arrange for @entity6 to be taken to a hospital ‘ set up for intensive care ’ but the toddler went into cardiac arrest while he was on the phone and was put on a ventilator to help him breathe			1
@entity6 suffered two more cardiac arrests and dr @entity26 said the decision was taken to stop his ventilator			2
dr @entity30 , of @entity97 in @entity98 , said an @entity22 would have helped but insisted there was no reason for staff at @entity15 to have ordered one , based on @entity6 ’s symptoms			1
he said : ‘ it does n’t matter if it was the weekend or not , from the evidence , there was no need for an echo			2
‘ that for a cardiologist is a very frightening thing because if i had to do the diagnosis again , given the information we had , i would n’t have done anything differently			0
’ a post-mortem examination showed the toddler ’s heart was enlarged and his lungs had a viral infection that contributed to his death but did not cause it			0
the cause of death was given as heart disease			1
the coroner recorded a verdict of death from natural causes			0
@entity6 ’s parents @entity128 , 35 , and @entity130 , 31 , from @entity16 , made no comment after the hearing			0
the @entity133 offered its condolences to @entity6 ’s family and said it hoped they would be reassured by the inquest ’s findings .			0

@entity6 died of heart disease at @entity15 , west @entity17
he was *n't* given an @entity22 as they are ' not normally done at the weekend '
experts say there was no clinical evidence that he needed an @entity22
however , if one had been carried out , it could have *flagged* up the disease
the coroner said he died from natural causes , there were no failings in @entity6 's care and he was treated ‘ appropriately ’
