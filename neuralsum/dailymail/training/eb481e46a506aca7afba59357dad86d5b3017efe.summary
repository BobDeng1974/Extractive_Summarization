by @entity0 published : 07:29 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 5 february 2013 a promising 13 - year - old footballer is fighting for his life in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest during a game			1
@entity6 collapsed on the pitch just minutes after complaining of feeling unwell at an under - 14s cup match in @entity9 , @entity10 , on sunday			1
first aiders and an off - duty paramedic gave the teenager cpr before an air ambulance arrived at the @entity15 and medics re-started his heart			1
talented player : @entity6 , 13 , collapsed on the pitch after scoring his third goal in an under - 14s cup aid : medics gave the teenager cpr before an air ambulance arrived at @entity15 he was stabilised before being taken to @entity27 , but doctors still do not know if he will ever play football again			1
speaking from his bedside , father @entity31 , 48 , said : ' he is still critical and still asleep , doctors have kept him that way for now			2
' he is still on a life - support machine and he is undergoing tests to try and find out what is wrong with him			2
' we have been told that his pulmonary artery is in the wrong place , it is in the middle of his two heart chambers rather than going through it			1
' because he was playing football and his heart was working hard to pump the blood , it basically crushed the artery which caused the heart attack			1
' it is believed the football - mad teenager had just scored his third goal when he suddenly felt unwell and complained to his father of pains in his chest			1
terrifying : doctors said they will not know how much damage has been done to his brain for some time within minutes @entity6 , from @entity62 , @entity10 , had collapsed on the side of the pitch and medics performed cpr on the youngster			1
it is thought that he was ' unstable ' for around an hour before doctors managed to regulate his heartbeat			2
mr @entity6 today described the moment he thought his son had died in his arms , saying : ' it was a quarter - final cup match and he had played the first half and scored a hat - trick - he is a top goal scorer			1
' about five minutes into the second half @entity6 put his hand up and came running off the pitch clutching his chest			2
' i was stood on the other side of the field and i saw them sit him down and wrap coats around him to keep him warm			2
' i could see something was n't right with him so i went round to see him			0
' he was sat in the crouched position and i put my arm around him and he told me that his chest really hurt			0
' within seconds of saying that , his head fell back , his eyes rolled back , he fell into my arms , and he stopped breathing			0
' i have never seen somebody look like that in my life , he was so white			0
' then all of a sudden somebody , i think another parent , was performing cpr and then somebody else came along and carried on and that was ultimately what saved him			0
' if i had n't have gone across to see him , nobody would have noticed him , he would have rolled backwards , people would have thought he was taking a nap or something and he would have died			0
' i 'm so glad i went around to see him , it keeps going over and over in my head			0
' the father said @entity6 is now showing signs of improvement after doctors reduced his muscle relaxant and he had begun to flex his fingers and even cough			2
' they obviously had to put him straight back under again but they just wanted to see how he was doing ' , he said			0
' things are starting to look up now , there are a few signs that are giving us hope			0
' frightened : @entity6 's family , including brother @entity122 ( pictured left with his sibling ) gathered at his bedside doctors now think the schoolboy will have to have an operation to put his artery back in place			1
@entity6 's cousin @entity130 , 21 , tweeted a message of support for her relative , which was yesterday picked up and retweeted by @entity135 , who himself collapsed on a football pitch			1
ms @entity130 described her cousin , who is the youngest of four , as a ' football - mad @entity139 fanatic ' who would do anything for anyone			2
miss @entity130 , from @entity143 , @entity10 , said : ' the whole thing has come as a big shock because he is so young , no one would ever have thought it would happen to him			0
' he is just the most genuine kid you will ever meet and if he ca n't play football again he will be absolutely devastated			0
' his whole life is football , if he 's not out with his mates playing football then he 's in his room playing @entity155 , it 's all he talks about and all he ever wanted to do			0
' he is the biggest @entity139 fan you will ever meet as well , he absolutely adores them			0
' he 's just a really cheeky chappy , totally harmless and very lovable			0
' @entity159 kept him going , but it also could have been the death of him , it 's so awful			0
' talented player @entity6 's dream is to sign for a premier league team in the future			1
but doctors can not be sure how much damage the heart attack has caused to his brain and said it would be impossible to tell until much later on			1
@entity6 's distraught father , mother @entity170 , sisters @entity171 and @entity172 and brother @entity122 were awaiting the results of a heart scan at his bedside yesterday			1
@entity176 , chairman of @entity177 , @entity6 's team , said : ' the club 's thoughts and prayers are with the boy and his family at this time			1
' we are waiting to hear news on the boy 's progress but the emergency services were on the scene within minutes and did a fantastic job			0
