by @entity1 correspondent published : 07:00 est , 24 march 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 24 march 2013 there was a time when films stood little chance of success unless there was something steamy going on at some point			2
these days , however , it seems movie moguls find sex one big turn - off			1
experts say intimate love scenes have been vanishing from movie scripts in the last 18 months			2
sexually explicit movies like @entity18 , starring @entity19 , are no longer popular special effects , such as in the film @entity20 , are much more likely to appeal to viewers this is not only because producers want to avoid an adult - only rating , but also because women are increasingly the ones who choose what film to watch when they go to the cinema with their partner			1
it marks a huge shift from the days when films deliberately courted controversy with their sex scenes			0
among the most famous examples of this were @entity19 uncrossing her legs in @entity18 and 9½ weeks , which starred @entity40			1
@entity41 , president of the film division of market research company @entity43 , said sex scenes were now regularly removed from scripts by producers			2
the executive , whose company looks at scripts for studios and filmmakers , said : ‘ sex scenes used to be written , no matter the plot , to spice up a trailer			0
' but all that does today is get a film an adult - only rating and lose a younger audience			1
today such scenes are written out by producers before they are even shot			0
’ he told the @entity63 : ‘ they ask : do we really need the sex ? can we fill the space with dazzling special effects instead and keep the family - friendly rating			1
’ it was pointed out how this year ’s best picture hopefuls at the @entity73 contained a lot of violence but no explicit sex scenes			0
romantic plotlines feature less in modern films as they are more likely to incur r - rating the sessions , starring @entity83 , is one recent film featuring sex scenes that has failed to win big audiences @entity90 's film @entity91 , in which she plays a trashy blonde , also flopped among recent films which have featured sex scenes which have failed to win big audiences are @entity95 , which stars @entity83 as a sex surrogate , and @entity91 starring @entity90 as a trashy blonde with a sexual predilection for @entity100 prisoners			1
film producers are now desperate to avoid an adult - only rating because young people often drive the box office success of movies			1
the trend has also been linked to a report put together for @entity108 , which suggested that women over 25 are most likely to decide what film a couple watch			2
research also shows the percentage of adult - only films in the @entity115 dropped to 8 per cent last year , as compared with 12 per cent in 2001			1
only two films containing sex and nudity made the box office top ten last year			0
@entity120 , who directed 9½ weeks and @entity121 , said these types of film would not be supported today			0
he told @entity124 : ‘ i ca n’t think of the last relationship piece that was a success ... which is apparently why i have n’t done something for quite a while now			0

*raunchy* movies like @entity18 no longer a turn - on for film fans
family - friendly films with handsome male leads now more *lucrative*
