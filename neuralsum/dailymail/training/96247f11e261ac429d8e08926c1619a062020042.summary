published : 16:33 est , 26 april 2014 updated : 17:37 est , 26 april 2014 fresh doubts were voiced last night about @entity2 ’s proposed new high - speed rail line amid warnings that it will not succeed in regenerating the @entity5			1
a damning report raises fears that promises by @entity8 and other ministers that @entity10 will deliver essential economic benefits are ‘ a myth ’			1
it even warns that areas around proposed @entity10 stations would be simply ‘ potemkin villages ’ - fake regeneration created ‘ for political reasons ’ using large taxpayer subsidies			1
the @entity20 says more environmental assurances are needed if @entity10 is to go ahead			2
pictured , a potential @entity10 train design the claims - by respected free - market think tank the @entity25 - come after it emerged that new treasury minister @entity27 had called the economic case for @entity10 ‘ questionable ’			1
more than 20 @entity30 mps are set to rebel this week in commons votes intended to pave the way for the controversial £ 50 billion project			0
@entity10 is scheduled to provide a 225mph link between @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 by 2030			2
chancellor @entity40 has called the line an ‘ engine for growth ’ for the @entity5 and the @entity42 , while the prime minister has said the 330 - mile network will transform the nation ’s ‘ economic geography ’			1
but the think tank report – to be published tomorrow – concludes that there is little evidence for the promised major economic benefits			1
the report , entitled ‘ @entity54 and the @entity55 ’ , said similar boasts were made for @entity2 ’s first high - speed line – @entity57 in @entity58 , which cost an estimated £ 11billion at today ’s prices			1
dissent : new treasury minister @entity27 has vowed to fight @entity10 according to the report , the line failed to revive the @entity58 economy and some parts of the region have similar rates of unemployment to depressed industrial cities in the @entity5			1
the think tank also cast wider doubt on the benefits of faster rail links by citing the case of @entity74 in @entity75			0
it argues that @entity74 had ‘ enjoyed a fast rail link ’ to @entity36 for several decades , with its first 125mph ‘ @entity81 ’ service introduced in the late 1970s and electrification of the route completed in 1991			0
despite that , the town was ranked 42nd worst out of 318 @entity85 boroughs in the 2010 @entity86			0
‘ clearly , a fast rail link to @entity36 has not transformed @entity74 , ’ the report concludes			0
it also suggests that any boost to specific areas from having a new @entity10 station would be limited			0
‘ the areas around the @entity10 stations will of course be redeveloped if the scheme goes ahead			0
‘ but these new districts will most likely be “ potemkin villages ” – examples of fake regeneration built for political reasons using large taxpayer subsidies and appropriating property from existing owners			1
’ the criticisms will be seized on by opponents of @entity10 who claim the massive expense and upheaval is not justified			0
just this weekend it emerged that before she was made a treasury minister earlier this month , @entity110 mp mrs @entity27 vowed to fight the project - which passes through her constituency - claiming its economic case was ‘ questionable and rapidly deteriorating ’			1
last night , @entity116 sources were unable to say whether mrs @entity27 would be taking part in this week ’s commons votes			0
but the @entity119 dismissed the think tank report as ‘ bizarre ’ and insisted the line would provide a ‘ huge economic boost ’			1
a source said : ‘ the idea that @entity57 has n’t brought significant benefits is just wrong			0
‘ just look at the regeneration around @entity127 or ask the people of @entity129 [ the site of a @entity57 international station ]			0
‘ and the idea that better transport connections do n’t help places to grow and prosper is plain bizarre			0
‘ @entity10 will create 100,000 jobs and provide a huge economic boost to the @entity5 and @entity42 , which is why city leaders across these regions support it			2
’ last year , @entity10 , the publicly owned company overseeing the project , published a major study by consultant @entity140 claiming the line could boost the @entity2 economy by as much as £ 15 billion a year			2
but last night , @entity30 mp @entity144 , who is set to rebel against @entity10 in the votes this week , said : ‘ this new report confirms what we know – @entity10 will not solve the @entity150 divide			2

comes at it emerged treasury minister has called project ' questionable '
