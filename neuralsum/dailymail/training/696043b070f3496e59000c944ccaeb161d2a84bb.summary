by @entity0 and @entity1 for the @entity2 the big banks sent hundreds of thousands of letters from fake debt collection firms to ‘ intimidate ’ customers			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 / @entity10 admit using the trick on families deep in the red			1
the letters misleadingly suggest that law firms and outside debt collectors are being called in			0
the admissions , which follow a campaign by the @entity2 to highlight the scandal , came in a series of letters released last night by @entity23			1
in one of them , the chief executive of @entity8 confessed the bank had used a number of ‘ debt collection brands ’			1
it seems that this practice was widespread ' appearing to acknowledge intimidation , @entity36 said the letters were meant to indicate to customers ‘ an escalation in the seriousness of the situation ’			1
@entity11 chief @entity43 said the bogus letters ‘ reflected what had become a common industry practice in a sector that had come to put its own interests above those of its customers ’			1
@entity30 , @entity53 chairman of the @entity31 , which published the letters , said : ‘ these letters seem to have been designed to pull the wool over consumers ’ eyes			1
‘ many customers will have been understandably misled			2
intimidating : how the letters appear to customers ‘ what is more , from these responses it seems that this practice was widespread			2
banks say that they have now stopped sending such correspondence but it should never have happened in the first place			0
’ the @entity2 revealed the extent of the problem in july , which prompted condemnation from citizens advice as well as investigations by @entity23 and the @entity75			2
the @entity31 asked the banks to provide samples of the letters they sent out to customers and questioned them as to how long they had been using these debt collection methods			2
yesterday , the committee published an exchange of letters with @entity11 / @entity10 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , which make clear they have all been guilty of long - running subterfuge			1
@entity86 , a @entity87 member of the @entity31 , said an ‘ urgent inquiry ’ was now needed into a practice he said was ‘ obviously designed to intimidate people ’			1
@entity8 , @entity7 , @entity11 and @entity9 all admitted using the practice for many years , but said they had now stopped following a public outcry			1
@entity94 boss @entity93 apologised and offered to resign in july this year after similar practices were uncovered at the organisation , which handles tens of billions of pounds in student loans			0
but none of the banks apologised in their letters to mps			0
mr @entity43 came closest , saying : ‘ i totally accept that we must always make it clear to our customers who they are communicating with			0
‘ i will not defend the continuation of a practice that does not meet the standards ( i set for the business )			0
the customer interest test should be applied to every single thing we do as a business			0
this activity failed that test			0
’ overwhelmed : the letters will likely have been sent to some of the banks ' worst - off customers in heavy debt mr @entity43 said @entity11 had established an in - house solicitor , @entity123 , to help it collect debts			1
it also used the brands @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 to fool customers into thinking they were dealing with outside agencies			0
last year alone , @entity126 issued 423,000 letters to 119,000 customers , while @entity123 sent out a further 29,000 letters			0
mr @entity36 claimed the use of other brands helped alert customers who had stopped opening letters from the bank that they were in trouble			0
he said text messages were now used			0
campaign : a @entity2 headline on july 4 this year @entity7 chief executive @entity143 said it had used four separate in - house brands to suggest it had called in outside help in collecting debts			1
mr @entity143 said the practice dated back to 1985 and stopped in july this year – after it was exposed by the @entity150			0
thousands of @entity7 customers struggling with their debts received letters from @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
in each case , the letter was actually from a part of @entity7 , although this was made clear only in the small print			2
@entity9 also admitted using a ‘ separately branded identity ’ when collecting debts , but insisted this had never involved posing as a legal firm			2
the banks insisted the true ownership of the fake debt collection and legal agencies was made clear in the small print			0
last month the payday loan firm @entity172 was ordered to pay £ 2.6million in compensation to 45,000 customers over the practice .			2

@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 / @entity10 all admit using the trick
