by @entity0 for @entity1 when @entity4 gave birth to her only son @entity6 , the child 's existence was kept secret for more than five years until fellow singer @entity8 inadvertently let it slip during an interview			1
since then , the notoriously private musician has kept her son in the shadows , revealing little to fans and the media other than his name			2
now , that seems set to change after 16 - year - old @entity6 , an aspiring musician in his own right , joined her on stage at the @entity21 last night			1
stepping out of the shadows : the mother of all comebacks was inspired by the son she once tried to hide from the world			2
@entity28 - the son @entity4 had with her husband - sings , acts and dances in the show sporting a straw trilby from under which a halo of red curls could be seen , @entity6 was one of five backing singers and has been , according to reports , working quietly with his mother for the last few years			1
' he gave me the courage to push the button , ' said @entity42 during last night 's performance			1
it 's been a fantastic adventure so far			0
and it 's only just begun			0
' so who is @entity28 ? born in 1998 , his very existence was kept secret for years and he continues to live quietly with his mother and father @entity51 in @entity52			1
known to be hugely supportive of his mother , he joined her at the @entity53 as she picked up a @entity54 , watching proudly from the sidelines			2
but like his parents , music is his real passion and he has a track named after him on @entity60 and boasts singing credits on another track , somewhere in between			0
still secretive : @entity4 remains a private person and covered her face with her hands as she was driven away big moment : @entity4 takes to the stage for the first time in 35 years - much to the excitement of fans all change : @entity4 in 1978 when she first burst onto the scene ( left ) and in a photo taken earlier this year and his mother certainly appears to appreciate it			1
as well as his mention on stage , @entity42 also wrote glowingly of her son in the programme			1
' without my son @entity6 , this would never have happened , ' she wrote			0
' without his encouragement and enthusiasm , particularly in the early stages when i was very frightened to commit to pushing the " go " button , i 'm sure i would have backed out			0
' throughout he has been my chief consultant , my editor , my confidant			0
in order for him to be part of this , which has always part of the deal , he has had to work really hard in order to keep his school commitments as well as his commitments to the show			0
' he is a very talented actor and beautiful singer , as you will witness and he brings something special to the show through his presence			0
' as for @entity6 himself , all he was prepared to say was to modestly note that he hopes his performances will allow him to ' earn his keep '			2
a chip off the old block if ever there was one			0
big moment : passionate fans such as @entity110 , 67 , waited 35 years for her to return to the stage big night : last night 's appearance at the @entity21 was the first of a scheduled run of 22 concerts			1

@entity28 , 16 , is the son of @entity4 and *guitarist* @entity51
appeared on stage with his mother at the @entity21 last night
has plans to become a singer and has been quietly working with @entity42
says he hopes his performances will allow him to ' earn my keep '
news of his birth in 1998 was kept secret for more than five years
