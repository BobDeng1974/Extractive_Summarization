@entity0 must wait until 4pm on monday , when the list of referees for next week ’s round of @entity5 fixtures is published , to learn if his ban will extend beyond one match this weekend			1
but @entity0 ’s upset over any further suspension will be heightened because he personally informed his employers , the @entity11 , about the telephone conversation with @entity14 manager @entity13 that broke refereeing protocol			2
the 39 - year - old referee , having already breached regulations by leaving @entity17 after @entity19 ’s 2 - 2 draw with @entity14 in his own car without his assistants so that he could get to an @entity25 concert , should not have conversed with @entity13 — and may be in further trouble for doing so			1
@entity0 was dropped from this week 's @entity5 matches after breaking referees ' protocol @entity13 has been given no punishment for the conversation between him and @entity0 but it is another example of football ’s double standards that @entity13 , who is understood to have made the call to @entity38 , faces no sanction for doing so			1
the @entity40 would only act if there was any suggestion of impropriety in their conversation			0
@entity45 , who launched in 2013 with a firm intention of knocking @entity48 off their perch , now seem to have lowered their ambitions			1
@entity51 , chief financial officer at @entity45 , told @entity53 cable business channel @entity52 that @entity45 did not need to own the sports tv market and would rather be a ‘ strong no 2 ’			1
@entity51 added : ‘ there ’s plenty of space for both of us to survive and survive well			0
’ @entity45 have invested in the likes of @entity62 , but now appear happy to play second fiddle to @entity48 it did not go unnoticed at the @entity65 hosted by @entity67 @entity66 at @entity68 on thursday that this initiative to promote female involvement in sport took place on the same day that a @entity40 buffoon was quoted as saying : ‘ a woman ’s place is in the kitchen and not on a football field			1
all the time i ’m alive , a woman will never referee in my league			2
’ @entity82 said of county vice-president @entity84 ’s views that have led to a four - month ban : ‘ his comments are deplorable and the @entity40 were right to take strong action			2
‘ at a time when there is so much good work going on to raise the profile of women in sport and encourage more women to get involved , it is extremely disappointing to hear about such sexist remarks			0
’ @entity66 , @entity98 , described a @entity40 official 's comments as ' deplorable ' the £ 10million cost of @entity103 ’s campaign to increase women ’s participation in sport has caused some concern among governing bodies			2
yet @entity103 have gone ahead with hiring an expensive pr agency , @entity109 , to promote the initiative , saying it was too big a project to be handled in - house			0
@entity113 goes clubbing @entity103 rugby coach @entity115 ’s desire to connect his international players with their grassroots beginnings — the ‘ journey ’ is a favourite @entity120 buzzword — has resulted in six of his squad presenting plaques this week to their first clubs			0
@entity115 takes training in a week when he encouraged his @entity103 players to go back to their roots @entity128 was one of the players whose previous clubs were invited to watch @entity103 train so ‘ unsung heroes ’ from @entity141 ( @entity142 ) , @entity143 ( @entity144 and @entity128 ) , @entity132 ( @entity133 ) , @entity135 ( @entity134 ) and @entity136 ( @entity137 ) watched @entity103 train before meeting @entity120 and being presented with commemorative signs by their old boys			0
meanwhile , the @entity145 are ramping up their communications army ahead of @entity147 year — they had six pr operatives at @entity120 ’s first briefing of the autumn international series as well as extra media personnel from @entity152 and the @entity153			0
a senior civil engineer involved in @entity156 construction has cast doubt on whether the highly complex stadium roof , the biggest of its kind in the world and already subject to £ 39m worth of unforeseen extra costs , will be completed in time for a safety certificate to be issued to host five @entity163 matches next autumn			1
the @entity165 's reconstruction might not be ready in time for next year 's @entity163 but the @entity166 insist the roof will be finished on schedule for a @entity170 athletics meeting ahead of the @entity163			1
and contingency plans for a harsh winter include stopping roof work — which does n’t need to be fully completed until @entity173 arrive in 2016 — whenever necessary .			0

the 39 - year - old referee will find out on monday if he gets a game next week
@entity13 has not been punished for his part in the *incident*
@entity45 happy to play second fiddle to @entity48
sports *minister* @entity66 reacts *angrily* to county referee sexism
doubts cast on @entity165 roof before @entity163
