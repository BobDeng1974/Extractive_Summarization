but @entity7 nearly missed out on a medal because sweets and ice cream were making him too fat , he revealed yesterday			1
the 18 - year - old , who won a bronze medal in the diving on saturday , had to go on a diet to be in with a chance at the @entity16			1
so he cut out his two vices , losing more than a stone			2
achieved his dream : @entity20 medallist @entity7 of @entity21 poses with the national flag after the medal ceremony after a shaky performance last night @entity7 was ecstatic to claim bronze jumping for joy : a relived @entity7 jumps in front of the media cameras @entity7 started his new regime after his coach , @entity30 , the director of @entity32 diving , said his @entity35 competitors were ‘ working three times harder ’ than him and he would have to take his diet more seriously			1
‘ at the beginning of the year he was saying i was fat , ’ @entity7 said after winning his medal			1
‘ i ’ve lost seven and a half kilos ( 1st 3lb )			2
i ca n’t wait to go and eat what i like ! ’ @entity7 , who began competing in international diving championships when he was 13 , said he had started putting on weight after he stopped growing			1
‘ when you get to a certain age you ca n’t get away with eating like a growing kid , ’ he said			0
‘ it got to the stage where i just needed to cut out the sweets , cut out the not so good stuff , and then cut down a little bit on portion size so that i got down to my fighting weight			2
‘ i made sure that i was eating healthy balanced meals , which i was anyway but just cutting out the snacks in between			0
' i love ice cream just generally , any flavour , i used to have one every weekend , so that ’s the main thing that i had to cut out			0
' it ’s worked out for me			0
i was glad i did it			0
’ @entity7 put in a strong performance to win bronze in the 10m platform diving final , ultimately missing out on a gold medal by the slimmest of margins here we go : @entity7 is thrown into the pool after winning his bronze medal well earned splash : @entity7 celebrates in the pool with teammates after winning a bronze medal the roar from supporters as they screamed , clapped and cheered whenever he appeared on the platform seemed likely to raise the roof but after returning to the athletes ’ village following his victory , the first thing he did was ditch the diet			1
‘ i had a tub of chocolate ice cream , ’ he grinned			0
hours earlier @entity7 leapt into the pool in delight after it was announced that he had won bronze in the individual diving			1
he dedicated his medal to his father @entity89 , who died last may from a brain tumour , saying : ‘ i really wish my dad was here to see me do that performance , because we had such a long , tough journey together			0
’ at a press conference yesterday , @entity7 added : ‘ the bronze was really a gold for me after the tough 18 months i ’ve had			1
@entity7 pictured with his father @entity7 who died in may last year , said he wanted to do his proud ‘ i ’m over the moon that i ’ve come home with a medal , it was something i ’ve worked so hard for since i was a young kid			1
’ in his father ’s last few days , @entity7 would hold his hand and tell him how much he wanted to do him proud at the @entity16			1
but he cut short just one training session throughout his father ’s long illness – on the day he passed away			0
that was exactly as his father would have wanted it			0
realisation : @entity7 gestures to team @entity113 after he realizes he has won a medal in the men 's @entity117 diving competition as his scores were displayed on the board they waved @entity122 flags and chanted ' @entity113 , @entity113 ' even after undergoing surgery , @entity7 senior cooked breakfast for his sons , drove them to their various training sessions and waved a giant @entity127 at the poolside every time @entity7 competed			1
following his father ’s death , however , @entity7 came under fire from critics – including his coach – who said he was spending too much time promoting his lucrative sidelines instead of training			1
in february , after a poor performance , @entity30 went public with his anger			0
‘ nobody will listen to me , ’ he said			0
‘ if @entity7 stopped all his media work now , i might be able to get him up to the third - best diver			1
winner : @entity7 of @entity21 settled for the bronze at 556.95 after leading going into the final dive in front of a raucous home crowd worrying : it was a tricky start for @entity21 's poster boy - his first dive ended with a splash and he was scored a 75.60			1
@entity7 and coach @entity152 complain to an official regarding a re-dive after flash photography from spectators interfered with his dive ' i do n’t mind what he does if he gets the medal			1
he can become a rock star			0
’ while @entity7 ’s success this weekend will help to silence his critics , it seems unlikely to stop his ambitions outside diving			1
there are already rumours that he has signed a deal with an independent production firm to launch his tv career			0
‘ going into tv presenting is actually what i want to do when i finish diving or maybe alongside diving , ’ he said yesterday			0
‘ but i do n’t know what ’s going on to be honest			0
‘ i have n’t had any meetings with my management people since the @entity178 so i do n’t know what they ’ve got planned for me but i ’d be excited to try something like that in the time that i ’ve got off			0
’ and , of course , there ’s @entity185			0
‘ an olympic gold medal is the next thing i want to achieve , ’ he said			2
support : @entity189 was also in the audience and could be seen high - fiving eldest child @entity191 as @entity7 stormed to the top of the leaderboard after his fourth dive			1
his two other sons , @entity197 and @entity198 were also with him before the event @entity7 revealed that @entity189 had text him words of advice ‘ @entity203 age for a diver is 22 to 24 so for me @entity205 is going to be a peak @entity16			2
‘ i ’ve already been doing the dives i do now for two years			2
' going into @entity185 i ’ll have been doing them six years and the next @entity16 i ’ll have been doing them ten years			0
‘ if i could get a gold medal in @entity185 then that would round off my collection			2
’ but for now , he said , it ’s back to normal			0
‘ i ’ve got my @entity216 a-level results on thursday and then i ’m back to school in september , so it ’s kind of just back to reality really			2
’ the already hyped pressure on @entity7 , one of the poster boys for the @entity16 , reached new levels in the past week after he finished fourth in the platform synchro alongside @entity224 ' i knew going into the last round that if i was on par with the others then they were going to overtake me because of the degree of difficulty that i had going into the last round , ' said @entity7 favourite : strongly - fancied @entity35 diver @entity232 competes in the semi-final top performer : @entity235 of @entity35 is expected to be among the medal contenders video : @entity7 fans took to the streets of @entity240 to show their support !			1

@entity7 led going into the final round , but was beaten into third by *excellent* dives from @entity245 , who won gold , and silver medallist @entity232
the 18 - year - old looked elated as the final results were shown , jumping in the pool and *hugging* those around him
@entity253 @entity252 : ' good luck @ *tomdaley1994* you *'ve* got this ! ! *#* @entity257 '
