by @entity0 researchers have uncovered a tiny 5cm long hedgehog that roamed what is now @entity4 52 million years ago			1
the creature , @entity6 , lived roughly 13 million years after an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs and left the mammals as the dominant land animals			1
about the length of a person 's thumb , it ate insects , plants and maybe seeds , the researchers said			2
the @entity26 has experienced many dramatic changes in climate since the dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago			1
the warmest period was the early @entity25 , 50 to 53 million years ago			1
during this interval , @entity32 mammal communities were quite distinct from those of today			0
' we were surprised by its tiny size , and frankly it threw me for a while and made it difficult to identify , ' said @entity43 paleontologist @entity42 , one of the researchers in the study published in the @entity46			1
its scientific name means ' tiny forest dweller			0
' today 's hedgehogs , and especially the ones that are kept as pets , are considerably larger			0
the smallest living hedgehogs are about 4 to 6 inches ( 10 to 15 cm ) long , not including the tail , @entity55 said , ' but the moonrats ( close cousins ) can actually be upwards of 18 inches long ( 46 cm ) and weigh a few pounds			2
' hedgehogs are known for the quills they use to protect themselves			0
the fossils were not complete enough to show whether or not @entity19 possessed quills			0
@entity55 said primitive hedgehogs that lived in @entity66 around the same time had bristly hair , so @entity19 may have had it as well			2
today 's hedgehogs also can curl up into a ball for protection			0
instead of being removed from the surrounding rock , the delicate upper jaw was examined with a high - resolution ct scanner at @entity75 to avoid damaging the tiny cheek teeth			0
the earliest known member of the family that includes hedgehogs and moonrats lived about 58 million years ago			1
today 's hedgehogs and their relatives live in @entity66 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
today 's hedgehogs , and especially the ones that are kept as pets , are considerably larger			0
the smallest living hedgehogs are about 4 to 6 inches ( 10 to 15 cm ) long , not including the tail			2
the researchers described another interesting mammal called @entity21 found at the same site , @entity94			1
it was a tapir - like creature about as big as a medium - sized dog			2
it was a herbivore about half the size of today 's tapirs but lacking the short trunk usually seen in these mammals			1
the half - pint hedgehog and trunk-less tapir lived in a rainforest along the edges of a lake , but it was not tropical , the researchers said			1
rather it was a cooler , upland rainforest , more akin to today 's climate in @entity111 , @entity112 in the @entity114 @entity113 , about 700 miles ( 1,100 km ) south of this location			0
' @entity94 is a window into a lost world , an evolutionary experiment where palms grew beneath spruce trees and the insects included a mixture of @entity4 and @entity124 species , said @entity125 of @entity4 's @entity126 , another of the researchers			1
' discovering mammals allows us to paint a more complete picture of this lost world			0

5cm long hedgehog roamed what is now @entity4 52 million years ago
@entity6 lived roughly 13 million years after an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs
lived *alongside* @entity21 , a creature half the size of *modern* tapirs
