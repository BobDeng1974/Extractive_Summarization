two - year - old @entity9 was doing barrel rolls down a grassy slope when she landed on the discarded hypodermic syringe			1
the needle pierced @entity9 ’s right thigh , causing the youngster to scream out			1
by the time mum @entity16 , 25 , turned round , @entity9 had pulled the syringe out and was holding it with blood splattered on her trousers			1
anxious wait : @entity21 will have to wait for up to two months to learn if her daughter @entity9 has contracted @entity8 horrified miss @entity9 , a hairdresser , rushed the youngster to hospital and @entity9 was given a @entity26 injection and blood tests			1
they now face a distressing two - month wait until @entity9 can have more blood tests and injections to see if she has caught @entity8 from the needle			1
the incident happened on a grassy embankment by the cricket pavilion in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38			0
miss @entity9 said : ' one moment @entity9 was playing happily , throwing a ball for @entity41 , our @entity43 terrier dog , and rolling down the embankment in the park and the next we were rushing to hospital			1
scene : @entity36 in @entity37 , where @entity9 rolled onto the needle ' she shouted out and i could see the needle in her hand , i thought she had picked it up but then i noticed blood on her right thigh and realised she had pulled it out of her leg			2
' when i looked closer i could see that she had stabbed herself and also been scratched by the needle , i was horrified			0
' we were seen within five minutes in hospital			0
' @entity9 had a @entity26 injection and a blood test but we were told we would have to come back in june and july to have more injections and blood tests			2
' it ’s only when they can compare the three blood tests that they can say for definite whether @entity9 has contracted @entity8			1
' it will feel like an eternity before i know for certain whether @entity9 is okay			2
' the risk that she has been infected with @entity8 is small but it ’s like there is a big , black cloud hanging over us			0
' i ’ve lived here all my life , the park is on our doorstep but there ’s no way i will ever take her back there			0
' it ’s a public park and lots of children play there , but it is also somewhere drunks and , obviously , drug addicts congregate			0
' something should be done to ensure that families are safe			0
