they had sworn their loyalty to her father			2
they risked their necks in his name , too			2
there was only one guest of honour they all really wanted to see yesterday			2
and her bow to them and to their fallen comrades said it all			2
if the protocol and the crowd control fell short ( to be honest , at times it fell apart ) , it certainly did n’t bother the @entity21 as she was thronged by her father ’s men yesterday			1
and after a day of emotion , frantic diplomacy – enlivened by the presence of both the @entity30 and @entity31 leaders – and some delightfully barmy @entity33 theatricals , the 70th anniversary of d - day concluded last night with a forceful and personal speech from the @entity21			1
cheers : the @entity21 toasts president @entity37 during the state banquet held at @entity39 in @entity40			1
in a powerful concluding speech , she said ' everything we do , we do for the young ' toast : the @entity45 raised her glass with the @entity33 leader at the elaborate venue			1
she also said : ' each year has compounded in @entity49 the benefits of our victory in the @entity53 ' tribute : @entity37 said @entity55 ' personified the phrase @entity56 ' in a warm toast at the event conversation : the @entity21 listened carefully to mr @entity37 during the banquet - where foie gras was served ‘ the true measure of all our actions is how long the good in them lasts , ’ she declared			1
‘ each year has compounded in @entity49 the benefits of our victory in the @entity53			2
seen in that light , those heroic deeds will stand out as much in 700 years as they do after 70			2
’ noting ‘ the joy of becoming a great - grandmother ’ , the 88 - year - old @entity21 added a telling sentiment that will , no doubt , be much quoted by future historians : ‘ everything we do , we do for the young			1
’ to @entity78 ’s beaches had come the grandest gathering of world leaders since the @entity81			2
it included seven monarchs and ten presidents , assorted prime ministers and cheeses of great magnitude from a couple of dozen governments and armed forces			2
yet the true stars of the show were those who had been on these very sands 70 years ago this very dawn			0
they ‘ marched ’ through the streets of @entity95 , feted by flag - waving children and cries of ‘ @entity98 ’ as they made their way to @entity78 ’s largest @entity101 cemetery			0
there , they were joined by the one head of state who could well recall every moment of that longest day ; who served in uniform ; who heard her father broadcast to the nation that night ; and who has always had a distinguished war veteran at her side – as he was yesterday			1
the arrival of the @entity21 and prince @entity116 was heralded by a full quartet from the @entity118 – two spitfires , a @entity120 and the mighty @entity121			1
tribute : four - year - old @entity123 at the grave of her great - grandfather who died on d - day historic : @entity128 ( centre ) shows his grandsons @entity131 ( left ) and @entity132 ( right ) the @entity133 before the start of an official event with @entity137 president @entity136 respect : a veteran looks at graves as @entity141 @entity21 and the @entity116 accompanied by the @entity142 and @entity143 attend a service of @entity145 at the @entity146 salute : former sailor @entity149 aged 89 from @entity150 , @entity148 pays his respects to fallen comrades the sound of their @entity155 engines and the sight of the @entity157 , unmissable in bright green , galvanised several old chaps up and out of their wheelchairs			1
they were struggling to their feet again as the bugle sounded the @entity167 and the @entity21 laid the first of many wreaths , followed by the @entity142 , the prime ministers of @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity33 and the governor - general of @entity174			1
and once the formalities were over , everyone wanted to have a word with the @entity157			0
‘ my @entity183 ’s meeting the @entity21 ! ’ shouted a lady from @entity179 charging through the crowd with a mobile phone			1
@entity184 , of the @entity179 branch of the @entity78 vets , was indeed having a word			0
display : thousands of attendees enjoyed a fantastic firework display at the @entity192 commemoration ceremony on @entity193 show : alpha jets , part of the @entity196 , leave trails of smoke in the colors of the @entity33 flag during the ceremony so was @entity202 , 92 , from @entity203 , who had come ashore on @entity204			1
staying on the safe topic of weather , he said : ‘ you did n’t order it did you ? ’ ‘ i might have , ’ the @entity21 replied			1
everyone had a story to tell			0
i met @entity212 who sat in a midget sub waiting to guide the @entity192 fleet			1
@entity33 - born @entity215 sheltered a badly injured @entity217 officer after his plane came down ; he became her husband			0
@entity220 heard @entity221 , 93 , had served with the @entity116 in @entity222 and steered him through the crowd to reunite him with the @entity116			0
many veterans wondered if there was something different about the place this year			0
a few years ago , the @entity229 noticed many of its second world war graves were deteriorating at a much faster pace than those from 1914 - 18			0
group : the @entity21 and president @entity37 stand before sitting at the top table along with prince @entity116 , right royal welcome : the @entity21 and prince @entity116 arrive at the @entity40 venue this evening for a state banquet dressed for the occasion : her majesty wore an elaborate white gown and her crown for the @entity40 event greet : the @entity21 shakes hands with president @entity37 - tonight 's host - while @entity116 leaves the royal vehicle in the background			1
her majesty requested that @entity248 was on the menu tonight it turned out that as @entity171 emerged from chaos in 1945 , @entity252 – shamefully – requisitioned all top grade @entity254 stone to repair government buildings			0
the commission ended up with the cast - offs			0
so it has spent two years and £ 4million replacing 8,000 of the most vulnerable @entity78 graves			0
among those paying their respects at a new headstone was four - year - old @entity123 , plus doll , whose great - grandfather died on @entity192			1
after meeting the commission team , the @entity21 went on to lunch with all the heads of state at the @entity270 , a wartime hospital			1
@entity272 came a group photo at which she was glad - handed by new @entity31 president @entity274			0
hellos : the royal couple were actually a few minutes late for the state banquet - most likely delayed following a long day of arrangements for the 70th anniversary of @entity280 arrival : @entity37 , who is single and so is attending the event alone , steps aside to allow @entity21 and prince @entity116 to walk up the red carpet towards the elaborate palace all eyes were on @entity30 ’s @entity286 , not least because of the @entity142 ’s observations on his foreign policy			1
to the relief of @entity171 diplomats , the @entity142 was lunching with veterans elsewhere and mr @entity286 kept a respectful distance			0
to be on the safe side , the @entity21 made sure she was deep in conversation with president @entity136 as they went through to lunch			1
@entity33 diplomats had thought long and hard about where to seat mr @entity286			0
the solution was to slot him near the top of the table but in tranquil waters – between the @entity305 and grand duke @entity306			0
after lunch , the leaders made the short journey to @entity193			0
here the hosts erected a vast arena where the 3rd @entity171 @entity313 came ashore on d - day morning			2
a thousand @entity171 troops were killed or wounded on this spot , although the landings were more successful on @entity318 than anywhere else			0
this was where @entity321 and his commandos came ashore to the sound of @entity325 as he marched up and down playing the bagpipes			0
smiles : the @entity21 stops at the top of the steps outside @entity39 for photographs			1
the royals will dine on a menu of saddle of lamb and garden vegetables followed by @entity337 vanilla ice cream event : the @entity21 smiled for cameras outside the @entity40 location			1
@entity37 tonight said @entity21 embodied the phrase ' @entity56 ' in a warm toast to the royal there were pipes once more here yesterday			1
president @entity37 could have staged this ‘ spectacle ’ anywhere along d - day ’s 50 - mile battlefront			1
but the @entity33 made much of the fact that they wanted to arrange things around the @entity21			1
this had been a @entity171 beach			0
and , as by far the longest - serving head of state present , she had the honour of arriving last			2
it seems pre-ordained that every anniversary of @entity192 should turn into a shambles			1
it happened on the 50th and 60th and yesterday was no different			2
as 7,000 guests sat baking in 26 - degree heat , the world leaders ended up spending an extra hour over lunch			0
we later learned presidents @entity286 and @entity274 had been having a meeting at the chateau			0
this might have been of great significance in geo - political terms			0
but it was of little solace to more than 1,000 veterans waiting for the show			0
worthy of note : the warm applause for @entity382			0
no @entity384 chancellor has ever had a welcome like that at one of these events			0
also worthy of note : @entity136 chewing gum throughout			0
official : the @entity21 and mr @entity37 pose for a few pictures before making their way in to the top table guests : @entity33 prime minister @entity397 and his wife @entity398 stop for photographs on the red carpet it was fabulously @entity33			1
black - clad dancers bounced on stage depicting the @entity405 conquest while pyrotechnics did the rest			0
eventually , they were replaced by d - day dancers plus much waving of flags			2
finally , all the veterans took a bow , to thunderous applause			0
the queen ’s state visit to @entity33 continues this morning			1
last night , she was the guest of honour at an @entity39 banquet			1
the day , she said , had left her filled ‘ with sorrow and regret , remembering the loss of so many fine young soldiers , sailors and airmen ; with pride , at the sheer courage of the men who stormed those beaches , embodied in the veterans among us ; and with thankfulness ’			2
@entity192 , she observed , reminded us of a great truth : ‘ we should weigh our actions not by immediate acclaim , but by their benefit for future generations			2

@entity21 arrived at @entity39 , @entity40 , for state banquet hosted by @entity37
the queen concluded 70th anniversary memorial with powerful speech
' everything we do , we do for the young ' she declared yesterday
follows day of commemoration for thousands who fell during @entity192 landing
