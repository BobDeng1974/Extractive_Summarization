a new photo of a mysterious flying object over @entity2 has been revealed			1
it appears to be the same aircraft as one that was snapped soaring over @entity7 last month			1
the exact identify of the aircraft remains a mystery , but rumours abound that it could be a secret jet			2
a mysterious flying object was snapped flying over @entity13 , @entity2 by @entity14			1
it resembles a similar unidentified aircraft streaking across the skies of @entity7 last month ' the photo is grainy because it was taken with a hand - held maxed - out 400mm telephoto lens through a cloud layer and then it was severely cropped to bring it up even close , ' says @entity14 , who took the photo on 16 april			1
' there is no way to know the altitude and no way to judge its size as there is no point of reference			0
' my sense of it with the naked eye was that it was quite high , at least the altitude passenger jets cruise over but if it were smaller like a " drone " it could conceivably have been lower and smaller			1
' the @entity38 speculates that the plane could be a @entity41 stealth drone or a prototype of @entity44 's next generation long range strike bomber ( @entity45 )			0
they , too , are unsure if it is the same plane as the one spotted previously a retired @entity49 with nearly two decades of aviation experience stepped forward with a compelling theory about the mysterious plane that was spotted flying over @entity7 last month			1
on march 10 , photographers @entity53 and @entity55 took pictures of three puzzling aircraft flying over @entity58 , and posted them online in hopes of identifying the planes			2
retired - @entity49 @entity61 submitted one of the more interesting explanations , telling the @entity64 he believed they were @entity65 - a spy plane that can cross the @entity44 in less than an hour , unmanned			1
the triangle over @entity7 : two photographers captured this mysterious object flying over @entity7 last month mystery solved ? a retired @entity49 says the plane pictured in @entity58 last month is the @entity72 - a plane designed to cross the country in less than an hour the mystery aircraft seen over @entity58 on march 10			1
three of the craft were spotted flying by @entity61 spent 17 years as a @entity49 and also worked with a jet squadron in @entity79			1
in 1956 , @entity81 magazines started getting eyewitness accounts and grainy photos of the @entity84 , then operating out of @entity85 on its first flights over the @entity87 - marking the first sight of a spy plane that government 's had hoped to keep secret from prying eyes			0
it provided day and night , very high - altitude ( 70,000 feet / 21,000 m ) , all - weather intelligence gathering			0
he says the @entity96 may have dispatched the planes to the @entity98 to aide in the search for missing @entity101			0
but @entity53 , who saw the planes himself , does n't agree			0
' the @entity103 is still in development , ' he said tuesday			2
' plus it 's a high - speed , high - @entity106 plane			2
these were going airliner speed			0
they were not in a hurry to get anywhere			0
' the @entity103 is currently being developed by @entity113 in @entity114 , and according to the company 's website they say the plane could be operational as early as 2030			1
it is the predecessor of the @entity119 which broke speed records when it flew from @entity123 to @entity124 in less than two hours in 1976			0
@entity113 's @entity126 program manager @entity125 wrote that the plane is designed to ' strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour			1
' ' speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades			0
the technology would be a game - changer in theater , similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today , ' @entity125 said			0
another source told the @entity64 that the plane was a @entity141 , but the two photographers discovered that no b - 2s were flying in the country that day the @entity103 is a successor to the @entity119 which broke speed records when it flew from @entity123 to @entity147 in less than two hours in 1976 another reader , who wished not to be identified , told the @entity64 with confidence that ' it 's a b - 2 stealth bomber flying out of @entity151 in @entity152			2
' that 's what the photographers thought when they first saw the group of aircraft , but they say they checked with the base and no b - 2s were flying anywhere in the @entity44 that day			2
instead , @entity53 believes that the planes are a no type of spy plane - a stealth transport plane that could sneak troops into a another country unseen .			0

a new image shows a mysterious aircraft flying over @entity2
the jet appears to be the same one that was spotted over @entity7 last month
photographer @entity14 says it may have been as high as passenger jets
a retired @entity49 previously said the mysterious plane is the @entity103
the @entity103 is designed to cross entire continents in less than an hour
developers at @entity113 say the plane could be operational by 2030
