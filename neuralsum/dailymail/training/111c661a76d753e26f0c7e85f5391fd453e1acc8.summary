parents have been urged to replace a child car seat after it failed safety tests and was branded dangerous			1
consumer group which ? has issued an alert to warn all parents about the danger of the seat , which was on sale online and at @entity10 , after it scored zero in safety tests			1
it said they had found a ' serious failing ' when the seat was put through crash tests , during which parts of it were ripped off			0
in a real crash the child would be at risk of colliding with the seat in front because of the failure of parts of the seat			0
@entity10 , which sold the car seat , said the seat had been removed from its catalogue in july , but a small amount of remaining stock would still be sold as the seat passes standard @entity34 safety tests			1
the @entity48 multi-recline child seat was previously on sale for £ 35			1
a spokesman from which ? said : ' if you own this seat , or know anybody who has this seat , we advise you to replace it as soon as possible due to a serious failing we uncovered in our car seat crash testing			2
' the seat has passed official @entity61 regulatory tests to be sold as suitable for children from birth up to 18kg , and was marked as @entity64 / 04 approved			0
the car seat is no longer being produced but @entity10 confirmed it was still selling any existing stock it had as it had met the standard @entity34 safety regulations			1
a spokeswoman said : ' as the product meets all of the required safety regulations we have not removed the remaining stock from sale			1
' which ? said second - hand products are available on websites such as @entity77 and @entity78 and advised against buying the seat or any second - hand car seats			0
the which ? front crash tests are carried out at 40mph , rather than 30mph , and these caused the shoulder parts of the seat to break off when the seat was facing forward and subjected to a front crash test the plastic seat shell did not withstand the crash and the harness came away as the plastic broke			2
the crash test dummy was not restrained properly and it scored 0 the car seat failed the which ? safety tests the assessment also includes a slide impact crash test , which the seat still scored poorly for the seat was marginally better when it was facing backwards , but still only scored 33 per cent which ? tests child car seats in a real car body , not on a sledge with a car bench seat fixed to it			1
this makes the fixing points for seatbelts more realistic the seat scored the lowest ever test score of zero per cent in the more demanding , independent crash tests , which are conducted at higher speeds and forces than the current @entity113 standards require			2
which ? branded the seat a ‘ do n’t buy ’ because the shoulder parts of the harness were ripped out of the plastic seat shell as it broke under the force of the crash tests			0
if this were to happen in a real - life crash , a child would collide with the seat in front , with just the lap part of the belt keeping them attached to the car seat			2
@entity10 no longer lists this particular seat in its catalogue			0
but it does sell a range of other @entity48 car seats on its website			0
as well as pushchairs , highchairs , baby carriers and equipment produced by the company			0
the tests , carried out by the test laboratory of the @entity143 car club @entity142 , are well - respected for how they have contributed to improving the standard of child car seat safety over the last decade			1
any child car seat marked as approved to @entity64 / 04 is better than no car seat at all and will provide some protection in a crash , but the results indicate that a child using the @entity154 car seat in group 1 mode , reclined , would be at risk of serious injury in the simulated crashes			1
the seat is not on @entity10 ' current list of recalls but which ? said production has stopped			2
a spokeswoman at @entity10 said : ' customer safety is our top priority and we were extremely concerned to hear of the issues raised in the which ? report regarding the @entity168			0
' following an internal investigation alongside our supplier @entity170 , we can confirm that we have had no issues or customer complaints in relation to this product			0
' the @entity168 range is sold exclusively at @entity10 and we stopped selling this particular car seat in july as part of our normal new range process , however a small number of car seats are still available			1
