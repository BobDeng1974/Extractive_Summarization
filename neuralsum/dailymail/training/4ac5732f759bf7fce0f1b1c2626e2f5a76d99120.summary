by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 22 november 2013 an ‘ extremely rare ’ board game piece from the seventh century has been unearthed that casts raucous @entity4 feasts in a new light			1
the draughts piece was discovered in the foundations of a royal great hall in @entity9 , @entity10 , and archaeologists believe it shows a more cerebral side to @entity4 festivities , which are thought to have involved a great deal of mead drinking			1
it is made from a hollow cylinder of bone that has been smoothed with lathe - turned end caps and secured with a small bronze rivet in the centre			1
the games piece is made from a hollow cylinder of bone that has been smoothed with lathe - turned end caps and secured with a small bronze rivet in the centre the games piece is the first to be found away from a burial site and the first of its kind to be discovered for 130 years			1
experts from the @entity33 believe it would have been used for a game similar to that of backgammon or draughts			1
the @entity4 had a strong tradition of playing board games and individual gaming pieces - and sometimes complete sets - have been discovered in burials of the period			2
however the fact the piece was discovered in a ‘ gaming setting ' , an @entity4 royal hall , suggests the people at the time played board games while enjoying the kind of lively feasts described in @entity54			1
the draughts piece was discovered in the foundations of a royal great hall in @entity9 , @entity10 ( pictured ) and archaeologists believe it casts show a more cerebral side to @entity4 festivities , which are thought to have involved a great deal of mead drinking it is difficult to establish the precise nature of the games played , but archaeological evidence from the @entity69 continent , the cultural home of the @entity4 , provides clues , according to the archaeologists			1
both ' tabula ' , a form of backgammon , and ' latrunculi ' , a board game similar to checkers , can be traced to these regions and were likely transported to @entity78 during the fifth century as a consequence of @entity4 migrations			1
dr @entity82 and his team at the university also uncovered items of jewellery , numerous fragments of luxury vessel glass and pits with animal bones , confirming that feasting and social display were integral to @entity9 's role as a place of royal ceremonial events and gatherings during the late 6th and 7th centuries			2
dr @entity82 said : ‘ our excavation is providing an unprecedented picture of life in an @entity4 royal complex			0
fragments of precious glass vessels are pictured			0
the glasses were not designed to be stood up like at dinner parties today , but would have been continually passed around and topped up by servants , dr @entity82 said ‘ gaming , along with feasting , drinking , and music , formed one of the key entertainments of the @entity4 mead - hall as evoked in the poem @entity54			2
‘ the discovery of @entity4 gaming pieces and gaming boards has previously been restricted to male burials , particularly those of the @entity4 elite			0
‘ to find such a well preserved example in the hall , where such board games were actually played , is a wonderfully evocative discovery			2
’ much of our understanding of @entity4 socialising comes from the epic poem @entity54 , where feasts are described as being mead drinking marathons , where drinks were spilled as glass cups had round bottoms and drinking games were played while music was played			2
dr @entity82 and his team at the university , also uncovered items of jewellery			0
archaeologists have described the find , pictured , as a miniature radiate headed brooch dr @entity82 told @entity144 that precious glass vessels were not designed to be stood up like at dinner parties today , but would have been continually passed around and topped up by servants			2
' they drank to get inebriated but it was a sociable activity ... and there was little requirement to put the glasses down			0
' he said a royal feat would have included plenty of mead and possibly wine and archaeological remains show that lots of meat - particularly suckling pig - would have been on the menu			0
' imagine rich food along with drink and music and heroic poetry being recited - there was a lot going on , ' he said			0
dr @entity82 believes gaming was an important part of the feasts and the king might have played other members of the court and it would have been a competitive activity			0
the fact the piece was discovered in a ' gaming ' setting , an @entity4 @entity178 in @entity9 , @entity10 , suggests the people at the time played board games as well as enjoyed the kind of raucous feats described in @entity54 ' it was lively and not too different from @entity186 parties these days , ' he added			1
@entity9 's royal complex was first discovered in 2012 when an @entity4 feasting hall was unearthed - the first such building to be excavated in its entirely in over a generation			1
the researchers discovered a sequence of three timber halls , bearing unusual and highly elaborate architectural features			0
this included mortar and crushed tile floors previously only seen in the earliest generation of @entity4 churches and massive entrance portals on a scale previously unparalleled in @entity201			0
‘ by combining these fascinating structural remains with a stunning array of artefacts , our excavations are providing new insights into the role played by @entity4 royal complexes in forging kingdoms and royal dynasties during this key period in @entity78 history , ’ dr @entity82 added .			0
