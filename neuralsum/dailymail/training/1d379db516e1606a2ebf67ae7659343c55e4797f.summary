by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 3 april 2012 smiling , healthy and six months old , @entity1 is understandably the apple of her mother ’s eye			1
yet when she was born doctors were stunned by her ‘ snow - white ’ appearance – because she had no blood in her body			1
a rare condition meant her blood had run directly back into her mother ’s circulatory system			0
@entity1 had haemoglobin levels of three instead of the average 18 the newborn had such a low count of haemoglobin – the chemical which carries oxygen in red blood cells – that it could not officially be classed as blood			1
she was given less than two hours to live but survived thanks to emergency transfusions which transformed her skin to pink			1
yesterday her mother told of her shock at a condition so unusual that it will be written into medical text books			0
‘ @entity1 was my first baby , so i did n’t really know what to expect – but i certainly did n’t think she ’d be that colour , ’ said 31 - year - old @entity28 , a barrister ’s clerk from @entity30 , @entity31			1
full of life : @entity1 was described by doctors as ' white and floppy ' when she was born intensive care : @entity1 was treated with blue light phototherapy for neonatal jaundice			1
jaundice is caused when the liver is not mature enough to adequately break down the red blood cells ‘ i ’ll never forget what the doctor ’s notes said – “ white and floppy ”			1
’ miss @entity28 said she and her partner @entity47 , 36 , noticed @entity1 had abruptly stopped kicking six weeks before she was due to be born			2
after three days without movement they went to @entity50 , in @entity51 , where doctors ordered an emergency caesarean			0
the 5lb 3oz infant had blood haemoglobin levels of only three , compared with a normal 18			2
she was given two transfusions in the special care baby unit			0
' she slowly turned this amazing pink colour ' : @entity28 with her precious daughter the condition is known as a fetomaternal haemorrhage , with severe cases occurring in one in 5,000 pregnancies			1
it can be spontaneous or as a result of trauma			0
neonatal nurse @entity67 said she had never heard of such low haemoglobin levels			2
‘ it was a miracle @entity1 survived			2
she was incredibly pale and had difficulties breathing			0
’ miss @entity28 added : ‘ it was amazing when they put the blood in @entity1 and she slowly turned pink			1
the hospital staff were amazing			0
they called @entity1 the “ miracle baby ” and said if i had n’t come in for treatment she would not have survived			0
‘ i want mums to realise how important a baby ’s movement is in checking they are healthy			0
you have to trust your maternal instinct			0

@entity1 had a severe case of newborn *anaemia* . the haemoglobin count in her red blood cells was too low to be classed as blood
@entity92 had two emergency transfusions to turn her from *ghostly* white to ' amazing pink '
