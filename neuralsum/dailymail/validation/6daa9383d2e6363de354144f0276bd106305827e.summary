' if @entity1 's death is a puzzle for you , it is a problem solved for me			1

' i knew that @entity1 was in close relations with @entity92 , @entity95 and the @entity96 , ' he claimed			2
but ' when he became dangerous for their recruited residents such as @entity10 politicians and oligarchs , the @entity12 secret services decided to get rid of him			1

it was a brilliant operation by the secret services			2
' you decide : @entity1 had a house ...			2

a fly would not make it			0

' ' from the point of view how it was planned , it is very much like @entity96 operation , ' he claimed			0
despite this , @entity10 police have identified a @entity205 link to the murder			2
