according to the @entity35 , the survey also investigated the probability of @entity0 being the victims of crime			1
however , the author of the report @entity40 of @entity42 's @entity41 said : ' it 's often reported that @entity45 individual are more likely to be at risk of violent crime than other communities			0
but not only is violent crime a rare occurance , it 's no more likely to affect @entity0 than others , such as @entity52 and @entity53			1
' researchers admitted that the survey does not include attacks against property , possibly under - estimating the extent of @entity60 crime			0
the new research , affirming support in the @entity1 @entity45 community for the police comes as fears grow over the number of people being radicalised by @entity69 extremists			1

@entity76 , mp for the @entity88 constituency , claimed that official figures on the numbers of @entity1 jihadis is grossly underestimating the size of the problem			1
@entity1 security officials believe in the region of 500 men have travelled to @entity83 and @entity82 , but mr @entity76 claims this figure is widely inaccurate			1
he said : ' the authorities say there are 500 @entity1 jihadists but the likely figure is at least three to four times that			1
i think 2,000 is a better estimate			0
my experience in @entity88 is it is a huge , huge problem			0
' mr @entity76 said : ' the government does not have significant people at border control			0
the fact is these jihadists are coming in and going out without almost ever being arrested			0
we have had hardly any arrests			0
we have had people coming back in after six months in @entity82 and they are not being picked up			0
