by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 06:43 est , 18 march 2012 updated : 06:51 est , 18 march 2012 @entity2 had advance knowledge that president @entity4 was about to be killed , according to an explosive new book about the 1963 assassination soon to be published by a retired @entity8 agent			1
rumours about the @entity12 dictator ’s involvement in a plot to murder his fierce adversary have swirled for almost half a century since communist sympathiser @entity15 shot the @entity17 president during a trip to @entity19 in november that year			1
now author @entity20 , who studied @entity12 affairs as a @entity8 analyst in the 1960s and later became the agency ’s chief intelligence officer for @entity26 , says he is certain that @entity2 at least knew the attack was going to happen			1
adversaries : @entity12 dictator @entity2 told staff he was going to murder president @entity4 to prove his allegiance to the communist cause , according to a new book by a retired @entity8 analyst on the morning of november 22 , 1963 , the day @entity4 was killed , @entity2 ordered a senior intelligence officer in @entity38 to stop listening for non-specific @entity8 radio communications and concentrate instead on ' any little detail , any small detail from @entity36 , ' mr @entity20 claims in his new book @entity42 – the @entity8 and @entity12 ’s @entity43 , set for release next month			1
four hours later , the airwaves came alive with news that @entity4 was dead			2
mr @entity20 also claims that @entity2 was aware that @entity15 , who had been denied a visa to visit @entity12 at the country ’s embassy in @entity50 , told staff there that he was going to murder @entity4 to prove his allegiance to the communist cause			1
' @entity2 knew of @entity15 ’s intentions and did nothing to deter the act , ' mr @entity20 writes in the book			2
in an interview published today in the @entity58 , mr @entity20 , now a respected senior lecturer on @entity12 at the @entity60 , says he discovered the information in interviews with former @entity12 intelligence officers , backed up by declassified @entity17 government documents			1
' i do n’t say @entity2 ordered the assassination , i do n’t say @entity15 was under his control			0
he might have been , but i do n’t argue that , because i was unable to find any evidence for that , ' he said			0
' [ but ] everything i write is backed up by documents and on - the - record sources			0
' did @entity2 want @entity4 dead ? yes			0
and he knew @entity4 was gunning for him			0
in @entity2 ’s mind , he was probably acting in self - defence			0
' that fateful day : president @entity4 rides through @entity19 moments before being assassinated on november 22 , 1963 mr @entity20 ’s book , billed as the first in - depth study of @entity2 ’s intelligence operations in the years after the @entity81 revolutionary seized power in a 1959 coup , says there is other strong supporting evidence			2
it claims , for instance , that @entity8 wiretaps of @entity12 intelligence agents in the immediate aftermath of the assassination revealed that they already had surprising level of knowledge of @entity15 ’s background when only scant details had been reported by the media			1
but it is mr @entity20 ’s interview with former @entity12 intelligence officer @entity99 , who was in charge of @entity2 ’s listeners at his @entity38 compound , which will raise eyebrows			1
claims : the new book by former @entity8 analyst @entity20 @entity106 , who defected to the @entity17 in 1987 , told the author that he informed the @entity8 at his debriefing that @entity2 personally issued the order to listen specifically for anything about @entity36			2
but that information was never revealed publicly , and he never repeated it until he was interviewed for the book			0
after his defection , @entity106 lifted the lid on @entity2 ’s lavish lifestyle , giving details of his fleet of luxury yachts , numerous lavish properties in each of @entity12 ’s provinces and a secret @entity123 bank account containing millions of dollars			1
but he said that while the population realised that ' @entity2 has ruined @entity12 ' , a fear of their leader meant few would ever speak up			1
' who can sanction @entity2 ? what parliament or national assembly can ask for an explanation of what is done with that money ? ' he said			0
the claim that @entity2 was aware of @entity15 ’s promise to @entity12 embassy officials that he was going to murder @entity4 comes from several sources , including a former @entity139 informant and ' superspy ' @entity141 , who penetrated the dictator ’s inner circle			1
@entity141 said that @entity2 told him that @entity15 ' stormed into the embassy , demanded the visa , and when it was refused to him headed out saying , ‘ i ’m going to kill @entity4 for this ’			2
' meanwhile , @entity2 was claiming publicly that @entity15 ’s visit to the embassy was ' a minor matter ' that had not been noticed by senior officials in @entity38			0
subsequent investigations by the @entity17 security agencies , and the official @entity153 inquiry into @entity4 ’s assassination , looked at @entity2 ’s possible involvement but concluded that @entity15 was a lone gunman acting independently			0
among other issues discussed in mr @entity20 ’s book are the @entity8 ’s own attempts to assassinate @entity2 using a variety of methods , including exploding cigars and poison pens			0
he says the efforts were called off after @entity4 died .			0
