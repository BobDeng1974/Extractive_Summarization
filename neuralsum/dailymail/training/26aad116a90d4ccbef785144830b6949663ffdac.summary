by @entity0 published : 20:03 est , 13 october 2012 updated : 02:56 est , 17 october 2012 @entity1 was a bit in the bain - marie last week for saying that @entity5 food is all about fancy sauces and plate decoration , and that she far ­ prefers @entity9 food			1
this was perfectly reasonable , i thought			1
this is not @entity13 , and she should be able to voice a preference without being put in prison			1
i 'm a huge fan of @entity1 , not because i ever cook any of her recipes – i have a phobia about ingredients , and do not possess an oven , nor much like food – but because she is so breath ­ takingly beautiful			1
breathtaking : ' she looks @entity9 with a teeny waist and hair colour of liquorice ' i once had lunch with her , and it was like being seated opposite a great @entity31 star , like @entity32 in her prime , or @entity34			2
she looks @entity9 , with a teeny waist and hair the colour of ­ liquorice , so why should n't she cook @entity9 ? she was nice , too , grabbing my hand and exclaiming that neither of us was wearing a huge diamond engagement ring ( i was married then )			1
' i hate women who show off , ' she said			2
and now along comes a @entity5 chef , @entity44 , a man who has a greasy slick of black hair that falls into his eyes , like an apron - clad @entity48			2
he said of the goddess @entity1 and her favouring @entity9 food : ' having witnessed her for the last 30 years of my life , it 's rather amazing for someone who has looked well over 60 for more than two - thirds of her life from behind , and who has scavenged a big part of her starting life on mostly amazing basic @entity5 cooking			1
@entity60 : ' how dare ' @entity44 say @entity1 looks old ' she is not even capable of supporting her own native cuisine			1
' @entity1 looks 60 years old ! from behind ! this from a man who might have @entity9 roots , but comes from a country that drowns wild birds in alcohol , then eats them , bones and all			1
a country where people eat horse , and foal stew , and foie gras			2
i once sent a young female food writer to interview @entity44 when he was running the restaurant at a country house hotel , and he was rude and mono ­ syllabic			2
he raises money for the @entity81 ( and also charges £ 695 and upwards for his masterclasses where you have your photo taken with him ) , but have you seen his recipes ? baked @entity87 cheese , wrapped in ham			1
crispy ham and cheese pork chops , fried in a knob of @entity92 not use the sebum from your dreadful bonce to fry a wild hare 's heart ? he is stupid , too			2
on his website , he spells @entity99 with an @entity100 , as in @entity101 , and uses brands that sponsor him , such as @entity104 ice cream			2
how dare you say our @entity1 looks old from the rear , when she does n't remotely look her age from any angle ? women in @entity111 , in their fur pelts and with their hoisted faces , emaciated bodies and lack of humour , look ancient			1
@entity1 is both creamy and dreamy			1
i hate male chefs , all of them			0
is n't @entity120 arrogant on @entity121 , while @entity122 is so encouraging , sweet as an @entity124 strawberry ? @entity125 once cooked me dinner : baked little gem hearts			0
@entity128 , that means hot lettuce			0
even i can do better than that			0
he once made marks on my virgin kitchen table , too , cutting pasta shapes			0
' what are you ! ' i yelled			0
' a toddler ? use a chopping board ! do you scribble on walls as well ? ' @entity141 invited me to lunch , then served me an entire meal made of truffles			0
who wants that ? the worst meal i ever ate was cooked by @entity149 – he of the dead shark 's eyes			0
when i told him i do n't eat meat he sent out a plate of asparagus , with nothing on top			0
female chefs are more open to new ideas , to people who are altogether less carnivorous than they are			0
i sat next to @entity160 last week – we were both in a studio having our make - up done – and i told her i do n't own an oven			0
' what on earth do you eat ? ' she said , eyebrows in her ironed hair			0
' i 'm sad that there is no woman in the final of @entity121 ' ' um , muesli with rice milk			1
anything cold , like an avocado			0
' ' i think we should all eat less meat , ' she said gravely			0
male chefs regard women who dare to have flesh on their bones as a sign of matronhood , of letting the side down , of not being attractive enough			0
but @entity1 is bigger than @entity189 in every way : he is merely jealous			1
i 'm sad that there is no woman in the final of @entity121 , which airs on tuesday			1
it 's the women of this country who have to cook , day in , day out , without plaudits			1
men merely make a mess , then expect to be praised like puppies who have used a puppy training pad .			0

' i 'm a huge fan of @entity1 , not because i ever cook any of her recipes , but because she is so breathtakingly beautiful '
