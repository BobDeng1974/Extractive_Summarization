by @entity0 @entity2 's founder could very well be turning in his grave at the news his ruling grandson has removed his revered image from the secretive country 's new banknotes			1
current leader , @entity9 , would have had to give his approval for the image of his grandfather , @entity12 , to be dropped from the country 's batch of new 5,000 won banknotes			1
the face value of each note is about £ 70 , although the market value is said to be less than £ 1			2
time for a change : the face of @entity2 's founder will not appear on the new batch of 5,000 won banknotes however , the current leader has approved images of @entity12 's house to be prominently displayed on the notes , along with pictures of gifts his grandfather @entity30 and his son , the late leader @entity29 , have received from foreign leaders			1
although there has been widespread speculation about the reasons for @entity12 's removal , most analysts suspect it is for ' continuity ' - lower value notes also depict the birth places of @entity29 and his mother			1
however , @entity43 , a @entity2 expert at @entity44 , has another reason			0
' removing his grandfather 's image suggests that @entity9 will follow an independent path to develop the @entity2 's economy , while due homage is being paid to the former dictators by depicting their birthplaces , ' he told @entity55 's @entity54 newspaper			2
revered : people bow in front of a statue of @entity12 in @entity59 , @entity2 keeping it in the family : @entity2 's current leader @entity9 ( left ) and his father @entity12 ( right ) other analysts suggest that the old notes were an easy target for forgers - two years ago counterfeit 5,000 won bills from @entity70 caused chaos in @entity2			1
it is not the first time the demigod founder 's image has been taken off the banknotes			2
his portrait disappeared from the 2,000 and 1,000 won bills after a failed robbery in 2009 , although the reasons were not made public			0
it was never disclosed what punishment the offenders were subjected to although it is doubtful they would have lived to try it again			0
the new 5,000 won note is @entity2 's largest denomination but with the market value being so low workers who receive on average 3,000 won a month have to seek second and even third jobs			0
the official announcement last month of the new banknotes that no longer feature the revered founder sent panic through the country among families who feared a total currency reform			0
when the currency was reformed a few years ago there was panic buying sparked by fears that many commodities would become too expensive .			0
