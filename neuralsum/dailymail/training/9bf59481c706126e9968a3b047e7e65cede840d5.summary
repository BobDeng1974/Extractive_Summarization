by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 are best friends			0
as they pile into the school bus on their way to morning lessons , they 're playfighting and planning mischief ... as they always do			1
these carefree kids are no different from millions of children the world over - except that they 're orangutans , their bus is a red wheelbarrow , and their school features the most unusual lessons you 'll ever see , thanks to a @entity23 programme called @entity24 : back to @entity25			1
first item on the curriculum , as the wheelbarrow deposits a gaggle of baby apes at the forest 's edge in @entity32 , @entity33 , is tree - climbing			1
@entity2 is becoming an expert , but @entity1 ca n't seem to get the hang of it and clings to his pal instead			0
@entity1 and @entity2 are part of the @entity42 project , where orphaned apes are taught the skills they 'll need to survive in the wild his weight drags her down , and they land in a jumble			1
shaking twigs and leaves out of their fur , the terrible twosome move on to the next lesson - learning how to get at the porridge and honey hidden in tree trunks			0
but there 's chaos again as two other students , @entity61 and @entity62 , decide to go playing in the trees that are out of bounds , further into the forest			1
it 's all in a day 's work at the @entity69 project , where orphaned apes are taught the skills they 'll need to survive in the wild			1
like the human education system , the orangutan school is divided into primary , secondary and college levels			1
@entity1 , @entity2 and friends are on the first rung , but in three or four years they 'll be ready to tackle more challenging lessons in nest - building and other forest skills vital for survival			1
project director @entity83 says the girl apes learn faster and make better progress			1
the boys are naughtier and much more boisterous , especially from the age of seven or so , and more likely to give the human handlers a playful nip from their powerful jaws			0
@entity91 : five orangutans sit in a red wheelbarrow ready to go to ' school ' one young female called @entity61 is top of the class at making treetop nests , weaving branches and fronds into a snug basket that will keep her safe through the night			1
but as she finishes her handiwork , a bigger lad rudely turfs her out and commandeers it for himself			0
bullying is a problem in this school as at all others			2
when the orangutans are ready for independent living , perhaps aged ten , they are transferred to ape university - a jungle island surrounded by a moat that has been carved out by mechanical diggers			2
volunteers monitor their progress and ensure they have enough food as they build up to graduation day ... and release into the wild			1
the importance of this school ca n't be overstated			2
orangutans are desperately endangered as their habitat is obliterated to make way for palm oil plantations , logging and mining for resources such as coal and bauxite - an aluminium ore			2
once there were half a million apes , but just a few thousand survive today			2
as the forests are chopped down , adult orangutans are slaughtered , and babies are illegally sold as pets			2
it 's a brutal trade - @entity2 has a scar across her scalp from the machete that killed her mother			0
a very young orangutan in the forest school learning practical skills for the wild orangutans have the longest adolescence of any animal beside ourselves , and they learn their life skills from their mothers			1
so it 's a daunting but crucial task for the human volunteer schoolteachers , such as @entity159 from @entity160			1
@entity159 sold her contract - cleaning business to work at the centre for seven months a year , often joined by her husband , stand - up comedian @entity164			1
one of her jobs is devising new ways of secreting food around the forest for her students to find			2
' we call that " enrichment " , ' she says			0
' rather than giving them food out of our hands or from bowls , we encourage natural behaviours , making them climb and forage			0
' sadly , not all the apes can ever hope to return to the wild			1
some may have become too reliant on people , or have suffered injuries in captivity - such as @entity182 , the centre 's biggest inhabitant , an adult male whose legs withered during years chained inside a tiny cage			0
@entity182 might never walk again , but he has an active mind			0
@entity159 dreams up food puzzles for him to crack , boxes to prise open and knots to unravel in search of a grape or peanut			1
it 's the ape equivalent of sudoku			0
' orangutans are so intelligent they get bored easily , ' @entity159 says			1
' they get stagnant sitting around in a cage all day , so this helps them stay mentally active and keeps their natural instincts alive			0
' workers must wear masks at all times to prevent human diseases from infecting the apes			2
they are not allowed to cuddle the babies either , and it 's not just the risk of sickness			0
orangutans are not natural huggers , because in the treetops they need both hands for holding on to branches			2
instead , the babies cling to their mothers until they are confident enough to let go			0
when humans hug and cradle them , the orangutans lose the instinct to cling - and that could be fatal later on			2
' they 're very lazy , ' laughs @entity159 , ' and they 'll take the easy option			1
even if one is crying in baby school , we do n't pick it up - instead , we give it to one of the other orangutans			1
it 's really important that they know they 're orangutans , not humans			0
from a young age they all crave companionship , and they buddy up quite quickly			0
' that 's why @entity1 and @entity2 are allowed to carry on causing mayhem together , when human children might be separated			0
and it 's why the wheelbarrow is so important - the apes can cling to each other as it bumps along the forest trail			1
but on the journey home , it 's sometimes a different story			0
too tired after a day 's study to clamber back into their one - wheeled bus , some of the babies hitch a ride on a human foot ... wrapping their arms round a teacher 's leg as they bounce home			0
even for these adorable bundles of fur , school really is hard work			0
