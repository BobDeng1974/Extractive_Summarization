the teenager , now 17 , claims her weight , which reached 21st 6lbs , was down to a genetic condition passed down from her father			1
@entity7 , 17 , who tipped the scales at more than 21 stone has had a £ 6,000 gastric bypass on the @entity4 because she was tormented by school bullies for being fat the genetic condition is a controversial topic among specialists and is so rare and hard to prove , that it does n't even have a name			1
it 's now known that being obese can take years off your life and in some cases may be as dangerous as smoking			2
researchers at the @entity35 found that people who were moderately fat , with a @entity37 from 30 to 35 , lost about three years of life			2
those who were morbidly fat , with a @entity37 above 40 , lost about 10 years off their expected lifespan , similar to the effect of lifelong smoking			2
a healthy @entity37 is between 19 and 24			0
the conclusions were drawn after they followed nearly one million people for an average of 10 - 15 years			1
moderately obese people were 50 per cent more likely to die prematurely than normal - weight people , said @entity47 , the @entity35 epidemiologist who led the study			1

they were one sixth more likely to die of cancer			0
@entity7 , who now weighs 15st after her surgery in january last year , said : ' ever since primary school i 've never felt accepted			1
i was terrorised and singled out , and i just did n't feel normal			2
' when people are shouting , throwing things and pushing you around , it 's hard to explain that you 're fat because of genetics			0
' i was upset and embarrassed because of my weight but the main reason i had the surgery was for my family			2
i wanted to reassure them that i will live a long , happy and healthy life			0
' it has n't been easy and many people have accused me of taking the easy choice out of this			0
but it has been tough , it has been painful , tiring and gruelling			0
' @entity7 started thinking about surgery at 14 - years - old after years of abuse at school			1
she had always eaten healthily and could not understand why she kept putting on weight			2
@entity7 was physically abused by bullies at school who threw objects at her , and on one occasion , pushed her head into a wall			1
the vicious assaults caused @entity7 to suffer from panic attacks , and she would fake illness to her mother @entity90 to avoid going to school			1
at size 28 , and after two long years of visiting specialists who told her she was too young to have the surgery on the @entity4 , @entity7 found a surgeon in @entity97 willing to operate			1

' @entity111 sent @entity7 to me because i had experience of performing this surgery on adolescents			1
the surgeons in @entity8 are extremely experienced bariatric surgeons but i do n't think they had done any adolescents before			0
' the gastric bypass operation was not performed on under 18s until a recent change in guidelines and is now only available for patients with a @entity37 of 40 or more			0
the operation comes with a risk of bleeding , internal hernia and deep vein thrombosis			0
@entity7 's stomach was divided and formed into a small pouch			1
her bowel was then divided and brought up to join the pouch in a complete overhaul of her plumbing system			0
her new stomach meant her food intake was restricted			0
she said : ' when i first woke up , i thought i was dying because of how much pain i was in - it felt like i was being stretched			2
' she spent three days in hospital recovering and it took a further six months for her stomach to get back to normal			0
@entity7 , aged four and three			1
she says that even at primary school , she never felt accepted - and was instead ' terrorised and singled out ' after two years of visiting specialists who told her she was too young to have the surgery on the @entity4 , @entity7 found a surgeon in @entity97 willing to operate she said : ' for months after the surgery , i did n't even notice i was losing weight but people kept telling me i looked great and a lot healthier			1
' then i started to get a lot of support around school			2
it was so weird because the people who had bullied me were now apologising for what they had done to me and offering to carry my bags			0
' i 'd never really had a group of friends before			0
now , i do feel a lot more accepted			0

' i hope to inspire teenagers to always follow their hearts and achieve what they want to achieve and be who they want to be			0
