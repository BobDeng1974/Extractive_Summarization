by @entity0 we 're a nation that runs on tea drinking , but what would you sacrifice for a cuppa ? new research has revealed how our love of tea is so great that one fifth of women would rather go without sex than give up tea			1
over a third ( 35 per cent ) of those polled would go without @entity15 , and a quarter would forego alcohol ( 28 per cent ) or chocolate ( 25 per cent ) - all in favour of a good brew			0
tea lovers : @entity22 is a notorious tea lover and even designed her own range of china but would she , like one fifth of women , rather go without sex than give up tea ? we 're also a fussy bunch when it comes to making it : 48 per cent of @entity34 prefer to make a cup of tea themselves , rather than trust someone else to make it because , they say , it just does n’t taste the same			1
results were even higher amongst the 55 - plus age group , with the majority ( 52 per cent ) of respondents saying they prefer to make their own brew			0
if you are going to accept an offer of a cuppa , think twice before taking one from a man , as 14 per cent admit to giving someone a brew in a dirty mug			1
men ’s slapdash approach might be due to less practice , as the average woman makes five cups of tea a day , versus the four made by the average man			1
that ’s 1,825 cups of tea made by the average woman each year , compared to 1,460 made by men			1
we really do love tea ! a fifth of women would sacrifice sex for a cup of tea , over a third would go without @entity15 , and a quarter would forego alcohol while we 'll use almost any excuse to have a cup of tea , there are rules that every tea - maker must abide by			2
nearly half ( 48 per cent ) of @entity34 think that leaving used tea bags on the kitchen worktop is the biggest tea - making no - no , although 14 per cent of people admit to doing so			0
leaving the tea bag in the cup goes against tea making etiquette for almost half ( 44 per cent ) of @entity34 , and serving tea with the remnants of washing up liquid is , quite rightly , frowned upon by 37 per cent of @entity91 residents			2
one in ten ( 10 per cent ) cite leaving tea stains from a wet spoon in the sugar bowl as one to avoid			0
fussy : the survey found that 48 per cent of @entity34 prefer to make a cup of tea themselves , rather than trust someone else to make it because , they say , it just does n't taste the same a spokesperson for @entity102 , who commissioned the research , said : ' it ’s really interesting the things that people will give up for a cup of tea - and how picky we are about how it ’s made			0
' according to our research , to create the perfect cup of tea you should use freshly boiled water , allowing the loose tea leaves to brew for about three minutes and add your preferred milk after water , with the sugar stirred in last			0
