the inner workings of ancient creatures shed light on the evolution of many modern species			2
now scientists have discovered the most intact ancient cardiovascular system and it comes from a fossilised arthropod			1
the cardiovascular system of the fossil arthropod @entity10 is 520 million - years - old and reveals a complex circulation network , according to @entity13 experts			1
earliest evidence : the cardiovascular system of the fossil arthropod @entity10 is 520million - years - old and reveals a complex circulation network			1
it is shown clearly in the x-ray ( pictured right ) as well as a dark carbon trace within the outline of the fossil ( left ) @entity21 was a predator , which appeared during the evolutionary burst called the @entity24 around 520 million years ago			0
it was around 4in ( 11cm ) long and had movable eyestalks , which had concentrations of nerve tissue inside them			0
it could rotate its eyestalks in a wide arc allowing it to see in different directions			0
the fossil , which is a distant relative of modern lobsters , spiders and millipedes , was discovered in @entity38			1
it shows a dark carbon trace within the outline of the fossil , which outlines a heart in the middle of the body with blood vessels leading to eyes , antennae , brain and legs			1
the discovery was made by researchers in @entity38 , the @entity52 and the @entity13 , who x-rayed the @entity55 fossil			2
most living animals move oxygen and nutrients around their body using a cardiovascular system			1
the fossil find is direct evidence that by 520 million years ago the arthropod group had already developed complex organ systems that remain recognisable in species today , according to the study , which was published in @entity67			1
arthropods are the most diverse group of modern animals and come in many different shapes and sizes			0
yet some of the basic arrangements of their cardiovascular system are distinctive to this group , such as a heart towards the back of the body and how blood vessels are arranged through body segments			1
complex : the fossil from @entity38 shows a dark carbon trace within the outline of the fossil , which outlines a heart in the middle of the body with blood vessels leading to eyes , antennae , brain and legs , detailed in this 3d diagram , which gives an idea of that the strange arthropod looked like ‘ this is a significant discovery			1
the exquisitely preserved cardiovascular structures of @entity55 protensa allow us to make direct comparison with other arthropods alive today , which has revealed the ancestral basic pattern for the wide range of cardiovascular systems seen in modern arthropods , such as insects , spiders , lobsters and millipedes , ’ said lead author and museum palaeontologist dr @entity97			1
‘ this cardiovascular system is closely linked to the brain , eyes and antennae of the animal , showing a high demand for oxygen from these highly active parts of the body			1
’ @entity55 is now the most anatomically well - known fossil arthropod as its brain , nervous system and gut have previously been identified			1
this gives more insight than ever about the early evolution of the group			0
evidence : the fossil find is direct evidence that by 520 million years ago the arthropod group had already developed complex organ systems that remain recognisable in species today			1
the fossil on the left shows the animal 's tough armour , while the fossil on the right shows its complex cardiovascular system fellow museum palaeontologist and co-author dr @entity143 said : ‘ the specimen is really unusually preserved			1
‘ the external structures of the animal were relatively decayed away and are preserved as an imprint of the body , but one single internal organ system is pristinely preserved as carbon trace			2
‘ we had to rule out what it was n’t , and were left with the cardiovascular system			2
then everything fell into place			0
’ arthropods have a rich fossil history , but until recently very little was known about their cardiovascular systems			2
the animal has a complex brain too : in 2012 scientists revealed that @entity10 had a brain just as complex as today 's lobsters and crabs			2
another fossil ( pictured ) showed the creature 's preserved brain as dark brown patches and is the oldest fossil example of a complex brain in early animals in october 2012 scientists revealed that the ancient animal @entity10 had a brain just as complex as today 's lobsters and crabs			1
another 520million - year - old fossil identified by experts from the museum showed the creature 's preserved brain as dark brown patches and is the oldest fossil example of a complex brain in early animals			2
the team used the museum 's scanning electron microscope ( @entity187 ) to look at the surface structure of the brain material and an energy - dispersive x-ray spectroscope to see how the details of the brain and optic tracts were preserved			0
they found that the brain was made up of three sections that were connected to the head segments			0
and nerve fibre tracts ran from the brain to the eyes and antennae			2
' we were surprised by the degree of complexity , which was more comparable to that seen in living crustaceans and insects , ' said dr @entity143			0
' the obvious comparisons are with crustaceans like lobsters or prawns because they also have movable eye stalks			0
the eye stalks have elaborate concentrations of neural tissue inside them , and the brain has 3 segments that are fused in front of the mouth			0
' the team said the animal could rotate its eye stalks over quite a wide arc , making it able to see in different directions			0
dr @entity143 said : ' it must have had quite acute vision			0
this is consistent with its relatively sophisticated brain because we would expect big , movable eyes to be associated with quite sophisticated neural wiring			0
’ it is thought that @entity21 branched off from the arthropod evolutionary tree before the common ancestor of today 's arthropods appeared			0
dr @entity97 said : ' the common ancestor of this diverse group [ arthropods ] may have also had elaborate brains similar to those of lobsters or flies , rather than to the simpler brains of , say , brine shrimp or fairy shrimp			0
’ it is extremely rare to find fossilised soft tissue but @entity253 - the site where both the fossils showing the animal ’s brain structure and cardiovascular system were found - is one of the places where soft anatomy of many different kinds of animals is preserved in exceptional detail			1
dr @entity143 said : ‘ the keys to preserving soft anatomy in @entity267 fossils seems to be low oxygen conditions that inhibit bacterial activity soon after the animal dies and then rapid burial of the carcass in fine - grained sediment			0

the ancient cardiovascular system belongs to a fossil arthropod that is related to the modern group *including* insects , spiders and lobsters
@entity10 fossil outlines a heart in the middle of the body with blood vessels leading to eyes , antennae , brain and legs
it was found in @entity38 and is direct evidence that the arthropod group had already developed complex organ systems that remain recognisable
