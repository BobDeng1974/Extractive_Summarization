it all comes down to silverware			2
when everything is said and done , progress at @entity3 is gauged by how many trophies a manager can collect			1
as someone who grew up in a family of @entity13 supporters during the club ’s most successful period , @entity8 - who celebrated his 42nd birthday on monday - is fully aware of what is expected when this side get to a semi-final : they have to finish the job			1
so it was interesting to hear the message @entity8 relayed at @entity13 ’s @entity24 training ground			1
@entity25 might currently be the best team in the country but there was no sign of concern as @entity8 explained how he intends to navigate a path to @entity31			1
@entity8 insists @entity13 can go to @entity25 and beat them in the @entity32 on tuesday the @entity13 players celebrate after @entity35 's equaliser last week at @entity3 @entity8 has impressed with the work he has done since arriving in june 2012 but now , with his philosophies in place , the moment is approaching where @entity13 have to press on			1
an opportunity awaits at @entity42 and @entity8 does not intend to let it pass			1
‘ we respect the opponent , of course , because they ’re a very good team , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ but we ’ve got nothing to fear in the game			2
we ’re a team that ’s in a good moment			0
' we ’re playing well , we ’re working well and we know we can go there and win — that ’s key			0
’ that has been the mantra since the first leg of this @entity32 semi-final ended in a 1 - 1 draw last week			1
the team @entity8 played then had an average age of 24½ , which suggests their best years are in the future , but collecting a trophy now would be huge for its development			2
‘ the manager spoke to us before the first game and said it is always the first trophy that helps you start something , ’ explained @entity65 , the in - form @entity66 midfielder			1
‘ he is looking for that first medal to put a mark on the group			0
‘ we were fantastic in the @entity75 last season but at the end we did n’t win			0
this group deserves something good and a medal to show how hard it works , and for the fans as well			0
we have a good history with @entity25 , back to the @entity83 when @entity84 was here			2
’ since the @entity84 era , @entity13 have inflicted some heavy blows on @entity25 — they knocked them out in the quarter - finals of this competition in november 2011 — but the really decisive matches ( the 2012 fa cup final and the pivotal @entity75 meeting at @entity3 last april ) have ended with @entity92 being the colour			1
@entity94 ( second right ) and @entity25 striker @entity96 ( right ) came to blows in the first leg @entity25 midfielders @entity100 ( left ) and @entity101 ( right ) tussle for the ball during a training session ‘ of course @entity25 will always be in the way of what we want to achieve because they are a big club , ’ said @entity65 , who has become something of a talisman , with the club being unbeaten in the last 14 games in which he has started			1
‘ they are the same as @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
when you get towards finals , you have to play them			0
hopefully this time it will go our way			0
’ mention of that @entity32 quarter - final evokes strong emotions for @entity65			1
he was in the best form of his career then but a ruptured cruciate ligament inflicted more damage than he could have envisaged , as it took what seemed an eternity to recapture his confidence and the belief of @entity8			1
recently @entity132 expressed interest in him but no bid materialised and @entity8 , having restored @entity65 to the team , maintained he did not want to lose a player who , in his youth , won the @entity138 , @entity66 ’s @entity140 award			1
‘ i just have to focus on what i can control and see what happens , ’ said @entity65			2
‘ i would be lying if i said i never thought about something new but i ca n’t tell you what is going to happen			0
i just focus on the day and leave the future to take care of itself			0
’ @entity148 and @entity8 greet before the semi-final first leg at @entity3 the @entity13 faithful are keen to get @entity152 to @entity31 ahead of his departure in the summer @entity65 has n't committed his future to @entity13 but says it will be special to get to @entity31 the focus on tuesday is helping @entity13 reach their 12th @entity32 final			1
although injured , he was in the party that travelled for the 11th , which ended with a penalty shootout victory over @entity161 in february 2012 , but felt on the periphery of the celebrations			0
this time he wants to experience it for real			0
‘ it was hard for me , ’ said @entity65			2
‘ when we were on our way to the stadium of course i was a bit down because i wanted to be part of it on the pitch and i remember @entity152 sending me a text which said , “ do n’t worry , we will get here again ”			0
it is something i always remember and hopefully we will make that come true			0
