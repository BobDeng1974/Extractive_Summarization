@entity0 has led a furious backlash against @entity2 after the defender escaped punishment for a ‘ @entity9 ’ dive in @entity7 ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity8			1
the @entity11 defender was already carrying a yellow card after a bad foul on @entity14 and then , with the score at 1 - 0 to @entity7 , took an embarrassing 53rd - minute tumble as he passed between @entity17 and @entity18 in the @entity8 area			1
referee @entity20 did not give a penalty but he enraged @entity8 manager @entity0 by opting against showing @entity2 a second yellow			1
@entity2 goes through @entity8 's @entity14 in this challenge that landed him in referee @entity20 's book @entity8 boss @entity0 was furious @entity2 was not sent off after taking a dive in the @entity8 penalty area @entity27 remonstrates with referee @entity20 after @entity2 's apparent dive @entity20 had already booked @entity29 for diving and later showed a yellow to @entity32 for the same offence – leading @entity0 to warn the @entity34 that they need to clamp down on simulation			1
his calls were echoed by pundits @entity38 and @entity39 , who said : ‘ diving is like a cancer which is spreading through football			1
’ @entity0 said : ‘ i ’ve just been asked if @entity2 should have gone , and the simple answer is yes , especially given the referee has booked two people for simulation or diving			1
‘ @entity48 , @entity49 or @entity29 are running at pace , so the smallest connection can bring them over			1
( but ) this is @entity11 ’s centre - half			1
he could have been a red card for his first challenge on @entity14			1
that was reckless and dangerous			2
‘ you expect the referee to do his job			2
’ @entity2 could have been given a straight red card for the foul on @entity14 earlier in the game @entity60 and and @entity18 protest to referee @entity20 after only brandishing a yellow card @entity0 added : ‘ look at the replays and there ’s no justification for it			1
he ’s taken off thinking @entity17 is going to challenge him , looking to win the penalty			2
‘ in @entity70 countries it ’s applauded			2
but people enjoy the @entity34 because of the honesty and integrity			2
we need to stop this simulation that has creeped in			2
that was not a hard decision			2
‘ when you see @entity49 live , with his short centre of gravity , you ca n’t touch him			2
the referee was 10 yards away			2
everybody in the ground saw it			0
‘ it ’s like something out of @entity9			0
it ’s that blatant , that obvious what he ’s trying			0
and yet there ’s some excuse they ’ll find for it			0
maybe we might not have been good enough to get something , but playing @entity7 with 10 men is a lot easier than playing against their 11			1
’ @entity96 writhes in pain and referee @entity20 brandishes a red card after a studs - up challenge from @entity18 @entity18 walks off while @entity102 checks on his team - mate , after @entity20 sends @entity8 midfielder off @entity8 ’s @entity18 was sent off for a disgraceful and dangerous foul on @entity106 shortly after @entity2 ’s reprieve , with @entity0 convinced the ‘ frustration ’ of @entity20 ’s earlier decision had pushed his midfielder to act so rashly			1
he added : ‘ @entity18 , who is the most laidback person , is frustrated with the decisions and produced a horror challenge which deserves a red card			0
’ @entity114 said : ‘ i did n’t see it on television			0
( but ) i do n’t believe @entity2 dived			1
and if you tell me i ’m wrong because he did , then something happened			0
or they blocked his run			0
but that big , honest guy , i do n’t believe he dived in the opposition ’s box			0
’ referring to @entity29 , whose dive was far outside the box , @entity114 added : ‘ @entity29 , if he wants to dive , does n’t dive on the midfield line			1
he dives in the box			0
’ @entity132 's @entity131 was accused of diving to win a penalty against @entity135 on saturday @entity137 's @entity136 was booked for an outrageous dive against @entity139 former @entity140 striker @entity38 said : ‘ @entity0 is right with everything he says			1
@entity20 bottled it today - @entity2 should have gone			1
what else would you call it ? ’ ex-england striker and @entity149 presenter @entity148 said it was up to players to tackle the scourge of diving			0
he tweeted : ' diving is getting silly			0
players need to self police the game			0
the only way it will change			0
what is the point of the @entity161 if they ca n't get their players to have a code of conduct ? ' former @entity166 and @entity167 midfielder @entity165 called for players to be punished retrospectively after claiming @entity132 's @entity131 dived to win a penalty against @entity135 on saturday , while @entity137 defender @entity136 was booked for an outrageous dive against @entity139			1
speaking on @entity171 said : ' i still believe you can do it retrospectively if you have the right panel of people			0
you could have an ex-player , an ex-referee and an ex-manager who could then impose a ban			0
i tell you it would stop so quickly			0
