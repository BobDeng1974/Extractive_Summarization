architects have revealed designs for a 190,000 - home town that would be built if @entity3 closes			2
three architectural firms have been commissioned by @entity5 to come up with proposals for ' @entity7 ' , which include new park land , a scientific research centre and a factory for self - made property to make it easier for people to build their own homes			1

architects have come up with plans for ' @entity7 ' which could be built if the airport is replaced by a @entity18 airport			2
in these design , created by @entity31 , 190,000 homes would be spread among ten centres , connected by the former runways according to supporters , the redevelopment of the airport could create 90,000 new jobs and add £ 7.5 billion to the @entity39 economy			1
in designs created by @entity31 , the @entity3 site would evolve to become a city of ten districts , connected by the existing runways and airport buildings			2
under that plan , developers would also create a research , technology and manufacturing hub , while homes would be made up individual houses , terraces , mansion blocks and communal squares			0
in a second set of plans created by firm @entity59 , there would be a ' self - build ' factory - for - homes plan			1
it would mean @entity64 could go online to order homes to their own specifications , something which is already common in several @entity69 countries			0
in a final plan submitted by @entity71 , @entity7 would be developed also using existing buildings			0
in plans by firm @entity75 , which were commissioned by @entity5 , the city would include a factory to allow people to build their own homes , something which is already common in several @entity69 countries the final set of plans by @entity71 shows a technology campus on the east side of the site , as well as a civic centre and retail hub in the @entity90 building a technology campus would be built on the east side of the site while the former @entity94 building would be renovated to become a civic centre and retail hub that would form the heart of the new community			1
new housing would be made up of self - build homes , community - led development , temporary housing , a development corporation and houses created by developers			1
as the plans were released , mr @entity20 said : ' the demand for new homes and jobs in the capital is such that we must be ready to start redeveloping @entity3 the moment it moves to its new site			2
and the sooner we start planning the better			0
the @entity24 - appointed @entity23 is considering plans for the @entity18 airport , which would lead to the closure of @entity3 , west @entity21 , pictured ' we asked our architects to be as creative as possible and these designs illustrate strikingly different visions of a @entity3 of the future			1
' he went on : ' however the key point is that all these scenarios would potentially create some of the many thousands of new jobs and homes this city will require given @entity21 is expected to increase in size by a fifth within the next 15 years			0
' how we deal with that is something we need to be planning for and debating right now			0
those discussions must not be delayed			0
' recent reports being prepared for the @entity23 have cast doubt on the feasibility of the @entity18 airport plan , which has been dubbed ' @entity136 '			1
the commission is due to make a decision this autumn on whether the estuary plan joins @entity3 and @entity141 runway schemes on the commission 's shortlist			0
a final decision on just where runway capacity should be increased will be made by the commission in summer 2015 .			0
