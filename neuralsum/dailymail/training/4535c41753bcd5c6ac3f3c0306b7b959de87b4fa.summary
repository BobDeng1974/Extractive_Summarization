people who are outgoing , hardworking , organised and relaxed do n’t only shine at parties and job interviews			2
they ’re also less likely to suffer diseases like stroke , arthritis , and heart conditions , according to a new study			2
and those who are anxious , moody , irritable , and prone to sadness are more likely to be diagnosed with such an illness			2
anxious and moody neurotic people are more likely to suffer ill health , the study found @entity20 researchers found a strong link between personality types and disease , in the first long - term study of its kind			1
they found that being highly conscientious , extroverted , open , agreeable and not very neurotic was associated with better health and lack of disease			1
this could be because these types of people are more likely to eat healthily , take exercise , suffer less stress and communicate better with physicians , they said			2
on the other hand , people who are highly neurotic – meaning they are anxious , worrisome , have mood swings and are often sad – are more likely to be diagnosed with a disease			1
this supports previous research found that neurotic people die earlier , although why this happens is not fully understood			1
one theory is that they deal less effectively with stress , so their bodies release more of the hormone cortisol , which in large amounts can damage the immune system and organs , including the brain			0
@entity53 this trait includes characteristics such as excitability , sociability , talkativeness , assertiveness			2
extroverts tend to be outgoing and energetic			0
@entity61 agreeable people tend to be trusting , altruistic kind , affectionate , compromising and value getting along with others			2
@entity66 those high in conscientiousness tend to be hardworking , organised and mindful of details			2
they are dependable , dutiful , show self - discipline and work towards goals			0
@entity74 @entity76 neurotic people tend to experience emotional instability , anxiety , moodiness , irritability , and sadness			1
openness this trait features characteristics such as imagination , curiosity and insight			2
those high in this trait look for new experiences and tend to have a broad range of interests			0
through a questionnaire testing participants ’ personality , researchers scored people on the ‘ @entity96 ’ personality traits			1
these are extroversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , openness and neuroticism			1
four years later , they were asked if they had been diagnosed with a disease by a doctor			1
the participants were scored on a scale of one to four on each of the personality traits			1
four meant their personality strongly displayed that trait , so a person who was scored four on the extroversion scale would be very talkative and outgoing , whereas a person who was scored one would be introverted and less talkative			2
below , they describe the differences in health for each trait : @entity66 conscientious people are hardworking , reliable , dutiful and able to control their impulses			2
they like things to be planned and like to achieve their goals			0
the researchers found that being a conscientious person can protect against the onset of disease			1
researchers found a one unit increase on the 1 - 4 scale for conscientiousness decreases the odds of a stroke diagnosis by 37 per cent			1
it also decreases the odds of a high blood pressure diagnosis by 27 per cent , arthritis by 23 per cent and diabetes by 20 per cent			0
one of the researchers , professor @entity140 , told @entity141 they did not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes , but added : ' because it was a new diagnosis of diabetes , and everyone is an older adult , i would guess that most were type 2			2
' type 1 diabetes is caused when the body ’s immune system incorrectly targets and kill the cells in the pancreas that are responsible for producing insulin			0
type 2 diabetes is when the body becomes less able to respond to insulin			0
it is usually diagnosed in over 30 year - olds and is often associated with excess body weight			0
the link between conscientiousness and health could be because people who are conscientious are likely to carry out healthy behaviours like healthy eating and exercise , which are important for preventing diseases like stroke , high blood pressure and diabetes , researchers said			1
openness open people are curious , imaginative , like playing with new ideas , and have a broad range of interests			1
a one unit increase on the 1 - 4 scale for openness decreased the odds of a stroke diagnosis by 31 per cent , heart conditions by 17 per cent , high blood pressure by 29 per cent , and arthritis by 21 per cent			0
being more open might help a person be more creative in relieving stress and may improve their health through better communication with physicians			0
@entity53 extroverted people are positive , assertive , talkative , social and like to be the life and soul of a party			0
researchers found a one unit increase in extroversion decreased only the odds of a high blood pressure diagnosis by 26 per cent			1
an increase in neuroticism raised the odds of being diagnosed with high blood pressure by 37 per cent , lung disease by 29 per cent , arthritis by 25 per cent and a heart condition by 24 per cent @entity61 agreeable individuals value getting along with other people			1
they tend to be considerate , kind , generous , helpful , trusting and trustworthy , and willing to compromise			0
a one unit increase in agreeableness decreased the odds of an arthritis diagnosis by 21 per cent			0
professor @entity140 , told @entity141 previous studies have not linked the trait of agreeableness to health , so he would want to replicate these findings in future studies to be sure of the link			0
one theory , however , is that the social connections well - fostered by agreeable people protect them against disease			2
he said : ' agreeable individuals are warm , caring			0
@entity227 connections are associated with good health , there ’s lots of research on that			0
that could be the reason why agreeableness is protective			0
@entity74 @entity74 people are sensitive and nervous , and often experience anger , anxiety , or depression			1
@entity74 people who are constantly worrying are more likely to develop a disease to worry about in later life , the study found			1
a one unit increase in neuroticism increased the odds of being diagnosed with a heart condition by 24 per cent , lung disease by 29 per cent , high blood pressure by 37 per cent , and arthritis by 25 per cent			1
the study as part of the study , researchers used data on 6,904 @entity20 , whose median age was 68 , who had visited a doctor or clinic within the previous two years			0
they had participated in the @entity260 ’s @entity259			0
in order to score their personality traits , participants were given a list of adjectives with a range of words from ‘ outgoing ’ , ‘ dominant ’ , ‘ friendly ’ and ‘ sophisticated ’			1
they were asked to report how well each word described them , and based on their answers they were scored on a scale between one and four for each ‘ @entity274 ’ trait			0
four years later , they were contacted asked whether they had been diagnosed by a doctor with any serious illness from a given list			0
being more conscientious - hardworking , reliable and self - controlled - or more curious and open to experience could actually protect against diseases like stroke , arthritis ( left ) , high blood pressure and diabetes ( right ) the study found women were more extroverted , agreeable , conscientious , and neurotic than men			1
older people were less extroverted , less conscientious , less neurotic , and less open than younger adults			1
married individuals were more conscientious , open and emotionally stable than people who were not married			1
interestingly , personality traits did not predict the diagnosis of cancer , one of the leading causes of death worldwide			1
it was not possible to infer from the data the increased risk of being diagnosed with a disease a person rated highly with any individual trait ( scoring four on the scale ) is than someone rated as a person rated lowly on that trait ( scored one on the scale ) , the researcher said			1
professor @entity140 , of @entity313 in @entity314 , @entity20 , told @entity141 : ' this study was important because it demonstrated that one ’s personality predicts and is associated with important diseases			2
researchers said being conscientious , open and extroverted meant people often ate healthily , took exercise , managed their stress and communicated well with physicians			1
one theory about why neurotic people suffer more disease is that their body releases more ' stress hormone ' cortisol , which harms the immune system ' the development of those diseases are really due to the way that you behave , and think and see the world			1
' the way that you approach the world , see the world , interact with the world , affects your health			0
' when asked if it was possible for people to change their personality in order to protect themselves against disease , he said it would be better to study why certain characteristics of personality are protective			1
he said : ' other research has shown that personality is not set in stone , we do change it subtly			0
' it ’s possible , over the course of 20 years , to see naturally occurring change			0
' right now we do n’t know how to change someone ’s personality to change their health			0
but we can look at the reasons why people with certain characteristics have better health , and people without those characteristics could replicate those mechanisms			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity369 .			0

researchers found a strong like between personality type and disease
people were rated on the ' @entity96 5 ' personality traits used by *psychologists*
these traits include extroversion , agreeableness and openness
also includes conscientiousness and neuroticism
being highly conscientious and open protects against diseases
@entity74 people are more likely to be diagnosed with a disease later on
