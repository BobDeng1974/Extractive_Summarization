successful at least , until the first ultrasound found two sets of heartbeats that gradually escalated to five bringing a number shockingly unexpected by the couple - though joyfully welcome - even with their doctor 's grim warning			2
' he spent over an hour telling us all the statistics and dangers that faced our little ones ; blindness , cerebral palsy , hearing loss , autism , mental retardation , even death			0
' he said he supported us with whatever decision we made , but he clearly implied that fetal reduction as the best option for having healthy babies			1
keeping all 5 was too risky and the statistics showed that at least 2 - 3 of our babies would have significant health issues , ' mr @entity14 wrote			1
