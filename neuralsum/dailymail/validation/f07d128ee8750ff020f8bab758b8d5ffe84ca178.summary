a @entity1 - based artist claims @entity2 has ripped off one of her designs			1
@entity5 ' @entity4 , who has more than 80,000 @entity7 followers , used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house			1
she uploaded a picture of one of the t - shirts she created with @entity14 inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to @entity2 's offering , which she captioned : ' at least make it better than the $ 30 ( £ 20 ) original @ versace_official			1
this looks like a first draft			2
' she also uploaded a snap of @entity2 's £ 440 @entity25 cotton jersey t - shirt and wrote : ' @entity26			1
sold out in 3 sizes			0
what is this madness ? from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends			0
what is this ? ' why ca n't these companies			0
these people create their own work ? what happened ? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them ? ( sic ) '			0
@entity44 has contacted @entity45 for comment			0
in an interview with the cut , the @entity48 - born designer said : ' i have always had a deep admiration for @entity2			1
it ’s an iconic brand that has stood the test of time			0
i am deeply disappointed in this			0
' this is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create			0
it is not only artwork from a collection that i created for @entity14 to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work			1
' but this is also my face ! i ca n’t understand how something like this could happen			0
' @entity45 , who is of @entity70 and @entity71 heritage , began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on @entity74			0
the @entity2 t - shirt 's description on @entity78 website reads : ' @entity2 ’s flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t - shirt			1
crafted from cotton - jersey and featuring @entity25 ’s head printed on the front , simply team with jeans for a luxe off - duty look			2
' @entity44 has contacted @entity2 for comment			1
speaking to @entity44 , @entity90 , an intellectual property partner at law firm @entity92 , the @entity95 member firm at @entity96 , said : ' @entity98 ’s design is certainly distinctive and the @entity2 design is strikingly similar			1
provided @entity98 ’s design is original , then under @entity101 law it will attract copyright as a graphic work			2
' it is for the @entity105 to decide whether @entity2 has copied @entity98 ’s design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the @entity105 may readily infer that copying has taken place			1
if so , @entity2 would infringe @entity98 ’s copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to @entity98 ’s			1
if they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t - shirts			2
' @entity122 , associate solicitor , eip in @entity48 , added : ' in short , @entity98 should be filing a law suit right away			1
the @entity2 t - shirt is clearly very similar to the t - shirt she developed for the @entity14 range in 2013			1
on the face of it , @entity98 has a good case , but will need to gather evidence to support it			0
' the design could be protected by both design rights and copyright , and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip - off			1
many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times , it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case			0
she is not on her own here			0
@entity145 is very common in the industry			0
' there is always the possibility that @entity2 has a good excuse but it will take some explaining			2
copyright infringement is criminal , and if @entity98 registered her design , copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws			2
if @entity98 has a registered design , she will find it easier to assert her legal rights now			2
