by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 09:37 est , 16 january 2014 prosecution : sir @entity4 will be charged with health and safety offences over the shooting of @entity8 , the @entity3 said today a knighted chief constable has been charged over the death of an unarmed man who was shot by police officers from within his force			1
sir @entity4 is accused of health and safety offences after @entity8 , 36 , was killed by police marksmen in march 2012			1
the unarmed man was shot during an operation by @entity16 to arrest suspected armed robbers			2
the senior policeman will not appear in the dock himself but is named on the charge sheet as the ' corporation sole ' - or human representative - for the force			2
if the conviction is successful , @entity16 will face an unlimited fine			1
previously , the @entity26 were convicted of health and safety offences after shooting @entity27 dead on the @entity28 in 2005			1
they were ordered to pay £ 175,000 plus legal costs			0
the marksman who killed mr @entity8 could have faced a charge of murder - but the @entity3 decided a jury would be likely to rule his actions were necessary			1
the father - of - four was shot after his car was stopped in @entity37 , @entity38 , as part of a pre-planned operation			1
it later emerged that the unarmed father of two had earlier been wrongly suspected of stealing a memory stick containing the names of police informants			0
the @entity46 reported that he and two associates were put under surveillance in an operation involving nearly 100 officers , and that armed teams were briefed that he might open fire at police , despite there being no evidence of him having access to weapons			0
the @entity59 found no vehicles were in mr @entity8 's vehicle at the time			1
shot dead : mr @entity8 , a father - of - two , was unarmed when he was killed by a police marksman in march 2012 scene : mr @entity8 was shot by police in @entity37 , @entity38 , when his @entity65 was stopped by officers as part of a pre-planned operation one round was discharged by an officer carrying a @entity72 carbine and this passed through the car windscreen and struck mr @entity8 in the chest while he was in the driver ’s seat			1
two @entity79 rounds were fired into the car ’s tyres by an officer carrying a shotgun to disable the vehicle			0
the car had been stolen and had false registration plates			0
a @entity88 canister was also deployed by hand into the vehicle by one of the firearms team			0
@entity92 , the @entity93 , said : ' we have completed our review of the evidence provided by the @entity59 in relation to the death of @entity8			2
' after careful consideration we have decided that the chief constable of @entity16 , sir @entity4 , should be prosecuted as a corporation sole for failing to discharge a duty under the @entity103			1
shooting : mr @entity8 was killed by police in march 2012			1
although the force could face a fine , the officer involved will not be prosecuted ' in addition to every employer ’s responsibility towards their employees , the law also imposes a duty to ensure that work is carried out in a way that ensures , so far as is reasonably practicable , that persons outside of their employment are not exposed to risk			2
' the chief officers of police forces are treated as employers for this purpose			2
it is alleged that there were serious deficiencies in the preparation for this operation that unnecessarily exposed individuals to risk			0
' a spokesman added that the officer who fired the fatal shot would be unlikely to be convicted			0
the @entity3 said : ' in the circumstances of this case , our assessment of the evidence is that a jury would accept that the officer did believe his actions were necessary and that the level of force used in response to the threat as he perceived it to be was proportionate			0
' the basis for the officer ’s belief in the necessity of his actions is relevant to the criminal proceedings under the @entity103 at @entity150 and it would be inappropriate to publish any further detail at this time			0
shot : a bullet hole in the windscreen of a red @entity65 that police opened fire at in @entity37 , @entity38 ' there is also insufficient evidence to prosecute the officer for gross negligence manslaughter or misconduct in public office			2
' @entity16 could not face a charge of corporate manslaughter because the force had no relevant duty of care towards mr @entity8			1
deputy chief constable @entity168 said : ' since mr @entity8 ’s death 22 months ago , @entity16 has co-operated fully with the @entity59 , the @entity3 and @entity170			1
our sympathies remain with mr @entity8 ’s family and we deeply regret the loss that they have suffered			1
' mr @entity8 ’s family , and the officers involved , have had to wait a long time for this decision to be reached and we share the frustrations over those delays			2
' however , we understand that it was vitally important that the investigation was carried out thoroughly to establish all the facts			0
' now that a charging decision has been made regarding the force itself , it is equally important that these legal processes are allowed to take their course unimpeded in order to seek a resolution for both the family of mr @entity8 and the force			1
' the @entity59 investigated this matter independently and we await the official publication of their report			0
this matter also remains the subject of an inquest , so @entity16 is unable to make further comment at this time			0
' the first hearing will be at @entity202 on february 10			0
