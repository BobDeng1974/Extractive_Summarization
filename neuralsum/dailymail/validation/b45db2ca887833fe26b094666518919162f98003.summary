once he had come round after emergency surgery , @entity0 asked the surgeon two pressing questions ; would he ever play again and if so , could he make it back in time for the @entity5 ? mercifully for the @entity6 and @entity7 no 8 – who had shattered his leg in a match against @entity11 the previous night – the answer to both was ' yes '			1
but that was just the theory ; the practice involves relentless determination and dedication , including endless hours in a hyperbaric chamber , where the 26 - year - old is mastering the art of sketching while wearing an oxygen mask			1
no stone is left unturned in @entity0 's quest to regain full fitness in time to be part of the national squad for the global gathering in september and october			1
there are no guarantees he will be ready , but despite the magnitude of his injury , the signs are good and he is infused with optimism			2
@entity0 is undergoing sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to speed up his recovery from a fractured leg @entity0 has been out of action since he injured his leg playing against @entity11 in january @entity0 was named @entity7 's player of the series following his superb displays during the @entity48 he simply has to take part in the tournament , and help the hosts excel , because the final takes place on his mother 's birthday and she would like her son to mark it in style ! on january 9 , @entity0 was driving for the line during an @entity61 match at @entity62 when his season was crudely terminated			1
he heard the sounds of breaking bone , and when team - mates and opponents moved sharply away as he lay on the ground , he knew he was in real trouble			2
' all i remember was that we had a scrum in the left - hand corner , i picked up the ball and went on a usual run , ' he told @entity76			2
' i got tackled by @entity77 and having looked back at the clips , i was able to see he wrapped his legs around my leg and i did n't really have anywhere to go			2
' at the time , i did n't really know what the hell had happened and i just started yelping			2
i like to think i would n't make those noises unless it was serious ! people moved out of the way pretty quickly and even though i was n't in that much pain , i knew i had done something			0
@entity91 8 @entity0 lines up @entity92 fly half @entity93 at the @entity94 ' i just did n't know how bad it was going to be , but i had an immediate realisation that i was going to be out for a while			1
when i got to the hospital , the staff were pretty guarded , but i got more of a sense of how bad things were when a few hours had passed			0
' a surgeon from @entity103 came to the hospital in @entity6 to perform the operation during the night and when the anaesthetic wore off , @entity0 sought to put his mind at rest about his predicament			1
' when i 'd come round , i fired loads of questions at the surgeon , ' he said			0
' the first thing was ' is it a career - ender ? '			0
i knew he could n't be precise , but i needed a ball - park idea of how long i 'd be out for and he told me six months			0
' the damaged leg contained a significant amount of precious metal ; to help the healing process			2
he will have another operation next month to replace a pin with more flexible wire , but a plate will remain in place			0
@entity0 has not yet had a chance to set off airport scanners , but he quipped : ' i 'm made of @entity126 – do n't put any magnets near me ! ' @entity0 is brought to ground by flanker @entity129 during @entity7 's loss to @entity131 in november his self - deprecating humour is part of a philosophical attitude towards the situation he is in			1
while a home @entity5 would be a momentous career highlight , he refuses to agonise about whether his recovery happens fast enough , despite moving heaven and earth to make sure it does			1
a six - month rehabilitation period would mean @entity0 is match - fit by july 10 and would n't need to miss any of the training camp which starts just before that red - letter date			1
but he said : ' if it takes longer , that 's just how it is			2
' @entity149 is the carrot , but i have to be realistic ; if i do n't make it , i do n't make it			0
i 'm not going to tear myself up about it			0
i 'm doing everything i can to get back for it , but there are certain hurdles i have to clear			0
i 'm quite relaxed about it			0
i 'm pretty sure i 'll be back			0
if i do end up going into the @entity5 training camp , i 'll be fresh			1
i 'll be blowing out of my a * * e , but i 'll be fresh ! ' the recovery programme has conventional elements , with @entity0 spending seven weeks in a cast and following up that initial stage with physiotherapy and weight - training at the club			1
but he is also employing cutting - edge methods to help his leg mend rapidly			2
twice a day , four times a week , he spends 90 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber at an @entity171 centre in @entity6			1
@entity0 makes another powerful ball carry against the @entity173 at @entity174 in november ' the bulk of what i 'm doing is oxygen therapy , ' he said			1
' i 'm being pressurised , to simulate being 10 metres below sea level , and i 'm breathing pure oxygen			0
the thinking is that it increases the red blood cells in your blood , which is brilliant for healing			0
' i go in the morning , then go to train with @entity6 , get physio and do upper - body weights , then go back to the oxygen chamber			1
i 'm in there for an hour - and - a - half			0
' to pass the time , @entity0 's creative side is emerging , as he is filling up a large sketch - book with pencil drawings			1
the subjects are wide - ranging			0
@entity194 regained the no 8 jersey in @entity0 's absence and has started all three @entity198 games ' i 've drawn a few pictures ; my dog , my nephew , a little @entity202 , a turtle , a light - bulb , ' he said			1
' there 's also a little lizard , a @entity207 , an owl … i 've just ordered some sketching pencils because it 's difficult to get good shading with the ones i 've been using			2
i 'm stepping it up ! ' i did a couple of bits and pieces at school			0
it 's just a bit of fun , a way of passing the time			2
i 'd be bored out of my brain if i was n't doing something like the sketching			0
' @entity0 was on a roll before his horror injury			1
he was named @entity7 's @entity226 after the autumn campaign and had usurped @entity194 to reclaim the no 8 shirt before his barnstorming progress was abruptly halted			1
in recent weeks , instead of being at the heart of the national team 's @entity198 campaign , he has been an observer			2
he will be at @entity174 next saturday to watch against and is aiming to spend a day at the team hotel , while maintaining contact with the @entity7 coaches			1
@entity236 will dearly hope to have @entity0 involved at the @entity5 and the long - term casualty is confident he will be ready			1
veteran @entity240 back rower @entity238 has been another player to profit from @entity0 's absence he said : ' i feel really positive and , hopefully , that positive attitude will help my healing process			1
some people get dragged down with really dark thoughts , but i 'm staying upbeat			0
' getting back in time is the hardest battle , but then i have to get selected again , which is going to be a very tough task			0
@entity238 has done well since coming back in , @entity194 is playing well too and i 'm missing a block of games			1
luckily , i ended on a bit of a high , but i 'll have had six months out of rugby			0
whether that is a good thing , because i 'll be fresh , or will count against me , i do n't know , but i 'll do everything in my power to be there			0
' if he makes it , he will have a sketch - book full of souvenirs from his rehabilitation – and a chance to give his mum the ultimate birthday present .			0
