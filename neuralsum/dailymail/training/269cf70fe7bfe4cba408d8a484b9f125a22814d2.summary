access : the prime minister says he worries when any of his three children ' grab hold of the @entity8 ' ( file picture ) on the issue of child abuse images , he told @entity75 : ‘ i ’m not satisfied that internet companies do enough to help take them down			1

‘ as a parent i worry , and i know people watching this programme worry massively , about what our children can get to see when they grab hold of our @entity8 or log on to the internet			1

@entity120 lets parents switch on a @entity172 facility to filter out offensive material			0

@entity180 , @entity120 ’s director of public policy , added : ‘ we do n’t rely simply on filtering technology to block child abuse images ; we go beyond that			2
