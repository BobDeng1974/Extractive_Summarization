police sources confirmed today that chains , ropes and other bondage devices were found in the house on @entity16 and that at least one of the girls was chained to the wall ' like a trophy '			1
it also emerged today that @entity5 would sometimes sneak the women out of the house in disguises and multiple sources confirmed that @entity27 's daughter @entity26 was taken out often to visit her ' grandma ' and be home schooled			1
a source with access to a police report told @entity34 that while the women were chained and locked inside different rooms in the home , holes were cut in the doors to slide things like food in and out			1
windows and doors of the house were boarded up and the back yard - where the girls were reportedly forced to walk on all fours on leashes like dogs - was covered with an eight - foot - tall fence made out of chicken wire and blue tarpaulin			1
it was also revealed that @entity5 would use a sick game to ' train ' the three girls not to run away by pretending to leave the house , only to beat them if they tried to run free			1
this is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years , in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling			1
reporters from local station @entity90 spoke to law enforcement sources who said that he would ' play this little dangerous game that he would tell the women he was about to leave the home , and then he would wait and if one of them tried to open that door , he would go in and attack them			1
' ' that was one of the ways he was able to keep them there , ' reporter @entity99 told @entity105 's @entity104			2
the trick clearly contributed to the young women 's captivity , as @entity27 stressed the fact that she feared his quick return during her frantic 911 call			2

' they were bound and gagged several times throughout the course of being held in that home , ' @entity90 reports			1

@entity26 , like her mother , was said to be dehydrated and malnourished , but eventually given the all - clear by a local hospital following their rescue			2
other children are thought to have suffered a different fate , as cadaver dogs were brought to the house by investigators searching for the bodies of any other children			0
