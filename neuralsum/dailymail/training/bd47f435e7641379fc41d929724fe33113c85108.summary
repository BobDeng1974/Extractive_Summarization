@entity1 hunk @entity0 has given a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes of the 1980s tv hit			1
the former @entity6 lifeguard starred in a never - before seen ' teaser tape ' that was used to sell @entity1 to tv chiefs , which today he unveils to @entity9			1
now 59 , @entity0 was a regular stand - in for @entity11 because of the star ’s ‘ chicken legs ' - and even taught baywatch bombshell @entity13 how to run on the beach			1
stand - in : @entity0 with @entity1 star @entity11			1
@entity0 's legs were used to cover up the @entity11 's ' chicken legs ' , he says chicken legs : professional lifeguard @entity0 ( right ) said he often stood in for 6ft 4ins tall @entity11 ( left ) due to his skinny legs @entity0 - affectionately nicknamed @entity0 - said : ' there were many times when @entity24 , who was @entity11 ’s stunt double on the show , and i filmed dangerous scenes together , and i would be driving a powerful race boat and @entity24 would be having to jump down into the boat going at some 60mph from a 70ft cliff edge and not land in the ocean , then he has to trust me to the right place at just the right time			1
‘ most of the time , when you saw @entity11 ’s legs , you were often looking at my own legs			2
@entity11 always had very skinny chicken legs ! ' @entity0 also worked as a technical advisor on @entity1 and admitted that although slender , many of the actors were n't fit enough for the show - so he had to put them through his own training camp			1
he said : ' i ’d teach them how to run with the lifeguard can and how to swim with your head up and get the basics down , so that when @entity13 ran with the can it did n’t look like she was holding a purse ! ’ ‘ i was technical consultant on the show and was constantly asked by the writers about every action scene we shot			1
' the head writer on the show would call me up and say : " @entity55 , what kind of equipment would we use in this scene ? what kind of radio equipment would the actors use ? what would the traffic sequence be ? what would they be saying on the radio ? " and i would dictate all this information to these guys and they would repay me by writing me some good stuff in the show			0
’ the show never did win an @entity72 as @entity0 says : ' it ’s so hard to remember all the storylines , but one thing i will say about the scripts is that we used to laugh because they they would adapt stories from all over the place and make them work for @entity1			1
‘ there was an episode with an electric eel that was attacking one of our guys in a cave , and so we used defibrillator patterns , the heart shocking device , to shock the eel and kill it , but it was a rubber eel			0
it was the stupidest thing i had ever seen ! ' you get the idea : @entity0 starred in a ' teaser tape ' for what his childhood buddy and fellow lifeguard @entity95 would use to sell his idea for baywatch to tv chiefs co-stars : @entity0 with @entity1 bombshell @entity13			1
the professional lifeguard trained @entity104 and other show stars baywatch was the brainchild of his schoolpal and fellow lifeguard @entity95 , who got him on board to film a trailer on @entity112 beach - complete with the now famous slow - motion running			1
@entity95 , @entity0 said , had long dreamed of making a show about lifeguards , telling his pal : ‘ you know , if that piece of s * * t show chips can be so popular , why ca n’t we make a television show about lifeguards ? ’ after a busy day on the @entity112 shore , @entity0 said : ‘ we ’d had one of those days where we ’d had lost kids and rescues and fights and drunks and people breaking into cars and umbrellas stabbing people - it was just a crazy chaotic day			1
‘ and so we decided to go and have a beer after work and think some more about it			0
’ @entity136 dealt a hand when @entity95 rescued the 13 - year - old son of tv executive @entity139 in 1978			2
when asked how he could repay him , @entity95 asked for help with his tv idea , which the pair worked on for 10 years			2
fun in the sun : @entity95 's tape of course included glimpes of bikini - clad girls on the beach @entity150 - style : baywatch became a byword for scenes of scantily - clad girls a smash hit : baywatch was axed by @entity157 after its first season in 1989 - but @entity11 and the show 's creators teamed up with producters @entity161 to turn it into a syndicated , international hit @entity0 also reveals that fate again stepped in when @entity95 ’s sister married a successful tv writer called @entity167 , who ended up becoming a producer on @entity1			1
@entity95 sold the show to @entity157 after showing them the tape and the show launched in 1989			2
but even though it featured the star of @entity176 , @entity173 was axed after one season , prompting @entity11 and the producers to sell it to @entity161 which sold the show internationally and created a syndication deal			2
it went on to become the most watched tv series in the world , running up until 2001 , and @entity11 , who played @entity184 , is believed to have made $ 70 million from the series			2
key player : @entity0 with @entity1 star @entity187 , who played lt. @entity188 today : @entity0 , now aged 59 , is battling @entity189			1
a trained lifeguard and firefighter , he ended up being the technical advisor on @entity1 and appeared in 159 episodes despite his long history on @entity195 appeared on 159 episodes - he would never quite make it to stardom - or achieve the same pay as the show stars			1
he says : ‘ the ratings went up , and then the ratings came down			0
and as the ratings came down , their way of fixing that problem was by firing everybody and getting a whole new crew , and one of the best ways to do that is to get the hell out of town , so that ’s when they took the show to @entity213			0
' and he smiles : ‘ to give you an idea of the kind of money i made , i bought a property next door to my house and renovated it and sold it			0
‘ i made more money building that one spec house than i made in all the years that i worked on @entity1			2
if i had n’t been wasting my time on @entity1 and had been building spec houses instead , i would have made some real money			2
’ fit : @entity0 , a trained firefighter and lifeguard , subjected all new cast members to his boot camp as he says none of them were fit enough for the series ! star : @entity13 had her breakout role on @entity1 as @entity232			1
@entity0 says his show pay rate was ' quite a bit less ' than hers he continued : ‘ the way i was treated on @entity1 , they did n’t give me a lot of respect and it would have been real easy for them to thank me , but for the seven years i was a screen actor , i got paid the absolute legal minimum , which when i started was like $ 350 per day			1
‘ i have no idea what it is now , and it ’s obviously gone up since then , but just the stinginess and the lack of grace on the show was n’t great			0
my rate was quite a bit less than @entity13 ’s			2
i have no idea what she was on , she may have been up at the $ 60 - 80k mark , where other girls on the show were on $ 1,000 an episode , so that could be seen as quite disrespectful , but it did n’t really have to be that way			0
’ similarly , he says , some of the actresses would only end up making $ 50,000 - a - year , when the taxman took his slice			0
after @entity1 , @entity0 became of one of @entity266 ’s leading water star trainers			1
copied : the final scene on the baywatch teaser tape shows @entity0 standing against the sunset - an image copied on @entity1 's titles he trained @entity272 in @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 for his role in @entity277			1
however , @entity0 , married to his wife @entity278 with two children , is now battling @entity189			0
he was diagnosed in 2011 after seeking help for a tremor in his leg and is retired , dividing his time between homes in @entity213 and the @entity285 , @entity286			0
he says : ‘ i suffer with the shaking and get tremors , i also do n’t walk very well due to an accident i had a few years before i got @entity189 ’s and although i had the foot treated it was always weak , and now the @entity189 ’s just makes worse			0
he adds : ‘ but as soon as i step into the ocean , i do n’t feel like i have @entity189 ’s			0
i can still swim , surf and enjoy the life i love and know			0
' action : @entity0 and pal @entity95 taped their teaser on @entity112 beach - with the lifeguard on duty turning a blind eye reboot : @entity0 says about the upcoming @entity266 movie : ' it better show some respect towards the profession of lifeguards in some way			1
i 'm not asking for much ' asked about the @entity310 reboot , @entity0 said : ‘ my first feeling about @entity312 being confirmed to star in the new baywatch movie is that i 'm available for some swimming lessons ! ‘ he 's definitely majestic , generally angry , so they 'll have to have some fun			1
i do n't want him to be serious			0
i would want him to play the role tongue - in - cheek			0
if they want to do comedy , then they can do comedy			0
but if they 're going to do a lifeguard movie , it better show some respect towards the profession of lifeguards in some way			2
i 'm not asking for much			0
