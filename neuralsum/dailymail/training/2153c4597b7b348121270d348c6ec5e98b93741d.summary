if you have stared into your cup of black coffee to wonder why there is often a misty white layer just below its surface that ripples and breaks apart , you are not alone			1
physicists have investigated the membrane , which was first identified by scientists in the 1920s , to find that it ’s made up of tiny water droplets that float beneath the liquid ’s surface and form a triangular lattice , which creates the ‘ mist ’			1
measuring just 20 micrometres across , the droplets fall from above the water surface like rain before they are trapped			2
physicists have investigated the strange ' misty ' white layer just below the surface of a cup of coffee ( illustrated with a stock picture ) to find that it ’s made up of tiny water droplets that float beneath the liquid ’s surface and form a triangular lattice , which creates the ‘ mist ’ researchers at @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity29 carried out the first modern study in to the strange phenomenon , @entity25 reported			1
‘ very few people appear to have imagined such fascinating phenomena happening in a teacup , ’ they said			0
using a camera placed underneath a water bath , they discovered that the ‘ mist ’ can be seen on tea and any hot water over @entity39 ( 122 ° f ) - it ’s just not as visible as it is in black coffee			1
measuring just 20 micrometres across , the droplets fall from above the water surface like rain before they are trapped			2
above are microscope images of the hot water surface at different temperatures filming the process , they discovered that the droplets fall from above and that occasionally droplets in a certain part of a cup - or water bath - vanish , causing the misty membrane to break apart			1
the researchers used a camera capable of 8,000 frames a second to film the action to show that the cracks appear at a speed of one metre per second and are accompanied by a wave moving across the surface of the coffee , just below the membrane			1
using a camera placed underneath a water bath ( shown ) , they discovered that the ‘ mist ’ can be seen on hot water over 50 ° c as well as tea and coffee while they may have solved some questions about the strange mist , they are not certain on some of the details			1
@entity77 and his team believe that droplets may be charged , allowing them to form a triangular lattice in areas of the cup that are packed with the minuscule bubbles			1
but they are not sure whether an electrostatic force causes them to levitate			0
they think that the droplets could be levitated by a flow of evaporating particles from the water ’s surface , but this is just a guess			2
they did however , find that the membrane cracks at the same speed as the tiny waves below the surface of the water , suggesting that the droplets are being swamped by a wave as it ripples along			1
the physicists have calculated that such a wave would need to be be high enough to catch a small population of droplets , causing some of them to burst and the surface of the membrane to break apart			2
they even say that cracks may occur because of a single water droplet triggering a wave that spreads			0
whether there is a membrane on your coffee or not , a study released in novemeber claimed that the drink could protect against dementia			0
drinking between three and five cups a day could cut the chance of developing alzheimer 's disease by up to 20 per cent , scientists said			0
nutrition can play an important role in preserving memory and thinking skills , especially during the phase of alzheimer 's disease before symptoms of dementia occur			0
this is according to a report published by the @entity131 , who are funded by major @entity134 coffee companies such as @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			0
research suggests that compounds called polyphenols are responsible for this protective effect ; compounds also found in high quantities in coffee			0
other studies cited in the report found regular , life - long moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing alzheimer 's disease			0
but experts from leading charities @entity149 and alzheimer 's society warned the research does not conclusively prove drinking coffee can prevent @entity153 's , because no clinical trials have been carried out .			0

@entity29 researchers carried out the first modern study in to the strange ' misty ' phenomenon that was first identified by scientists in the 1920s
they found that coffee 's white membrane is made up of tiny water droplets
the droplets form a triangular lattice , which creates the ' mist '
while they claim tiny waves may cause the membrane to break , they are *unsure* why the droplets levitate below the liquid 's surface
similar membranes form on hot water above 50 ° c , but ca *n't* always be seen
