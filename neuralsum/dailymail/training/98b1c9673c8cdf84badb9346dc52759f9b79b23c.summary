by @entity0 for @entity1 the talk on @entity3 this week has been about the footballing enigma that is @entity5 , but 20 years ago today the chatter centred on the emergence of a phenomenon			1
it was on august 28 , 1994 , that @entity10 wrote his name in the record books with the fastest @entity14 hat - trick , plundering his treble against an @entity17 defence which contained @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 in just four minutes 33 seconds			1
that devastating spell stamped the then 19 - year - old @entity10 as the most exciting young talent in the @entity24 game and ensured he was destined for a place in @entity27 folklore ; two decades on , it remains one of the @entity14 ’s most remarkable moments			1
video still got it ! scroll down to watch @entity10 's brilliant crossbar challenge hat - trick : @entity10 scored three goals against @entity17 at @entity27 in under five minutes @entity10 ’s hat - trick against @entity17 at @entity27 , august 28 , 1994 goal 1 — 25min 58sec goal 2 — 28min 42sec goal 3 — 30min 31sec total time : 4min 33sec ‘ is it really that long ? ’ @entity10 asks with a shake of the head , as he revisits that glorious afternoon when his professional life changed			1
‘ it ’s probably the thing i ’m known for most in the @entity14 and it ’s certainly the one i am most proud about			2
‘ i ’ve moved down to sixth in the all - time scoring list and , honestly , that is n’t a problem			0
' i do n’t mind people taking over in terms of the goals they score , both in the @entity14 and for @entity54 , but the hat - trick is the one achievement i want to stay as mine forever			1
’ @entity54 had started the 1994 - 95 campaign with an eye - catching 6 - 1 win over @entity61 at @entity62 but their next assignment , against @entity64 ’s @entity17 , was going to be the true test of their capabilities under @entity67			1
record : even 20 years later , @entity10 's hat - trick is the fastest in @entity14 history on a glorious afternoon , both sides had started confidently in front of @entity74 ’s cameras but midway through the first half , @entity10 exploded into life , scrambling @entity17 ’s senses and sparking pandemonium around @entity27 , hosting its first game without the standing @entity80			1
26th minute : @entity82 ’s right - wing cross bounces off @entity83 and falls invitingly to @entity10			1
@entity84 on @entity74 : ‘ they got a bit of luck there , @entity54			2
but when it dropped to @entity10 , on that left foot , was there ever going to be any end product but the net bulging ? he does n’t miss them			2
’ @entity10 : ‘ i remember the cross came in and i found myself in space after it came off @entity97			2
i did n’t think about what i was going to do			0
i just put my head down and hit it			0
’ 29th minute : @entity54 turn defence into attack with @entity102 setting @entity103 on a storming 60 - yard run			1
as the winger moves forward with menace , @entity10 starts to peel away			2
@entity111 on @entity74 : ‘ @entity103 … @entity10 , making a yard for himself … is it going in ? it is ! two in two minutes from @entity10 and they ’re going crazy here at @entity27 ! ’ goals : @entity10 is sixth in the all - time @entity14 goal - scorers list @entity10 : ‘ that was the best one			1
as @entity119 @entity118 kept running , @entity17 ’s defence kept dropping deep			2
@entity119 and i had a great understanding and i knew if i made an angle , he would provide the pass			0
i managed to squeeze my shot through @entity125 ’s legs and it left @entity18 unsighted			0
31st minute : @entity127 swaps passes with @entity128 just inside @entity17 ’s half and spies @entity10 on the move			1
as @entity127 delivers his lofted ball , @entity27 senses history is in the making			1
@entity111 : ‘ and he ’s away again here ! is this going to be the hat - trick ? … it is ! ’ @entity84 : ‘ that ’s incredible ! how ’s that for a cool head ? unbelievable stuff from @entity54 ! unbelievable stuff from @entity10 ! ’ @entity10 : ‘ what i remember most about this was the noise			1
the old @entity80 had been demolished , so all the season - ticket holders had been moved to the @entity27 end and the noise they made was incredible			1
when @entity148 put the ball through to me , i heard this roar go up as i was about to shoot			0
third : @entity18 and @entity20 try desperately to prevent @entity10 from scoring his sides third ‘ @entity20 and @entity18 tried to block my first effort but i got the bounce of the ball and i managed to turn it in from a tight angle			2
it was an amazing moment			0
’ @entity10 ( left ) ended that season being named @entity160 ’s @entity159			2
he also helped @entity54 win the @entity161 , having scored 31 goals in 57 matches			1
there were many more great days but , as he looks back on what he calls his best of all in @entity168 , there is one slight regret			0
‘ the ball , ’ @entity10 says			0
‘ i ’ve got it somewhere in the house but i could n’t tell you which one it is			0
‘ i kept all the hat - trick balls ( he scored nine , second only to @entity177 )			1
if i ’m honest , i regret not marking that one			0
i got all the lads to sign it but there was no fuss			0
‘ if i had given it some thought , i should have made a point of writing the game and date on it			0
‘ @entity17 were a lucky team for me and i had a lot of good times , including winning the @entity189 in 2001			0
‘ but people still talk to me about that day			0
it ’s great it is still remembered after all these years			0
