@entity1 , 60 , was furious after an investigation uncovered that several of his staff were using their work computers to watch online filth			1
the investigation also uncovered other cyber-slacking activities , such as the excessive use of @entity20 , but it was the extreme use of porn that angered mr @entity1 , the centre left mayor of @entity24 near @entity25 in @entity26			1
he has now ordered that all computers have access to the web denied , with connections limited to the council 's internal system only			0
mr @entity1 said : ' all i am prepared to say is that there has been an improper use of the internet within the council offices - that 's why there is no access to the web			1
' i am not prepared to go into the details of what the sites visited were , other than to say they were not work - related and not ethical			2
it was restricted to a limited amount of staff , not all 74 employees			0
' according to reports in the @entity2 media , some of the employees would clock on at 8am and then spend as long as six hours surfing pornographic websites hardly doing any work and only stopping when the town hall building closed for lunch			2
it also emerged that the building 's wi - fi was not secure , so locals would gather outside the building to log on and surf the web , also enjoying internet pornography			0
according to @entity2 meda , some workers were spending six hours a day perusing porn on the web			1
file picture despite the probe and crackdown , mayor @entity1 , who has been in office for two years , has decided that he will take no disciplinary action against the council employees involved			1
the case does no favours for the traditional view of many of @entity2 local government employees who have long had a reputation for laziness and being work shy - with numerous attempts by central government in @entity87 to try and clean up their act			0
in 2008 then public administration minister @entity89 launched a clampdown which claimed to have halved the number of sick days claimed by public employees by 50 % although the initiative is said to only have had a short - term effect			0
the mayor has now ordered that all computers be disconnected from the internet , with connections limited to the @entity24 council 's internal system among incidents uncovered at the time were a council worker who punched his time - card , then went boar hunting - only to get found out when he got shot in the leg and had to be rushed to hospital			2
another who claimed to have been on sick leave was actually discovered to have been on a ' long vacation in @entity112 , claiming that '' the sun would help '' speed up her recovery from a sprained back			0
more recently the mayor of the southern @entity2 town of @entity119 took to exposing lazy employees by posting pictures of them on his @entity20 site below the question : ' why are these people not working ? ' but the slacking is not just limited to @entity2 - an investigation at the @entity127 once revealed how dozens of civil employees there would also clock in and then leave to go out shopping or spend the day with friends and families when they should have been at their desks .			0
