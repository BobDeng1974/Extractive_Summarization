it 's an agonising dilemma faced by every bride - to - be around the world : just what to wear on her special wedding day ? but spare a thought for the women of @entity7 , where harsh winters can last for up to nine months of the year			1
and while those preparing to walk down the aisle in the @entity11 or the @entity12 pray the rain keeps away , in this part of eastern @entity15 they simply hope they get a nice ' warm ' day -- with temperatures even a little milder than minus @entity19			0
from recommending their footwear - definitely no high heels - to hiding thermals under their dresses , @entity30 has perfected the art of helping @entity15 women realise their dream of becoming a real - life ice princess for a day			1
' why do couples choose to marry in winter here ? well , what choice do they have in a place where winter may last for nine months , ' the 30 - year - old , from @entity56 , told @entity59			1
' the first couple i ever took pictures of were called @entity63 and @entity64			0
' it was december and it was n't very cold , only about minus @entity67 perhaps , but still when the bride was taking her coat off to pose with her naked arms and shoulders i was shaking my head and hurrying her to get dressed			2
' i told her , ' you 'll get cold ' but she answered back , ' never mind that - i want to look beautiful '			2
' oh that brides ' desire to be beautiful			2
the thing is , the coats that are offered in wedding dress shops are made from teddy bear skin			1
they are pure synthetics and , frankly , i think that it would be warmer without them than in them			0
' the coats are usually short with the neck open to every wind			2
' and no , you ca n't put an ordinary coat above the ' princess dress ' , and it is often too expensive to buy a luxurious real fur coat			0
' as well as the dress , @entity26 brides must consider their wedding coat , with this bride opting for a bold red which contrasts beautifully with the surrounding snow @entity30 has perfected the art of helping @entity15 women realise their dream of becoming a real - life ice princess for a day not a typical aisle , but @entity15 citizen 's are used to marrying against a backdrop of thick snow @entity30 says that brides ' desire to look like a princess in their wedding photos often see them brave the arctic weather @entity30 advises staying well covered up to the neck , but still struggles to keep couples outside for longer than 10 minutes @entity30 warns that many of the coats available at bridal shops are simply not warm enough so what to do ? many years experiencing the harsh winters has helped @entity30 come up with the answers - techniques seldom needed in @entity120 and @entity12			1
' on their legs you can put warm thick tights or thermals under the dress , ' she says			2
' i am very strict with my brides in saying that they can choose anything they like - as long as their legs and feet are warm			2
so traditional @entity134 [ felt boots ] or uggs are good			2
' typically the wedding dress is long and it is more important to keep their legs warm than to catch a fever after posing in high heel shoes in the middle of a snow drift			1
' they do usually listen to me , but sometimes that desire to be beautiful wins over common sense			0
' i remember a bride called @entity149 whose wedding was in january , when it was minus @entity151			2
i spoke to her a day before the wedding day about warm shoes , and as we left the house i asked her again if she had taken the boots			1
' she said ' yes ' but when we come to the park she jumps out of the car in her delicate shoes and thin white tights into the snow			0
' i 'm standing with my camera , in warm @entity163 , thermals , three pair of trousers above the thermals , a thick coat , gloves and a very warm hat			0
t is crucial for the brides to keep their feet warm and dry - and this groom is clearly keen to help out ideally , @entity30 says a thick real fur coat should be worn , but she says many can not afford them @entity30 herself dresses up in multiple layers to capture the shots , and the shoots tend to be brief ! despite the challenges that the extreme cold poses , it makes for a dramatic backdrop for the stunning shots ' the absurdity of it is that the dress is so long the pictures do n't even show what kind of footwear the bride has on			1
' @entity30 continues : ' i am always asking my brides to be take something warm with them			1
it does n't matter what it us , just as long as they can have it when we are walking from the car to the area where they 'll pose for me			0
' i also ask them to wrap something around their necks			0
i think the person that invented the typical style of wedding coats have only seen real snow in @entity12 @entity215 movies			1
born in a village near @entity56 , @entity30 graduated from the electromechanical faculty at @entity218 before starting her working life as a designer			1
but she is now one of the @entity7 city 's top photographers , working with a number of local newspapers in addition to her weddings			1
what perplexes her most is the fact that people in this part of the world expect long and harsh winters , yet forget how cold the weather might be on their big day			0
' i think often winter weddings are planned in the house , without going out and feeling what it would be like to pose barely dressed , ' she laughs			0
wanting to look beautiful can win over common sense as one bride shuns @entity240 for heels and thin tights ' of course when discussing their ideal images all couples promise that they will be ready to run around in the snow , make snowmen , go ice skating , you name it			1
' but you are lucky if you can take them for longer than ten minutes out of the car			0
they get immediately cold and start shivering , and their noses , ears and hands get bright red			1
and then naturally there is no point in taking pictures			0
' surprisingly @entity30 says the grooms do not fare any better than their brides			1
' unlike the brides they have to wear shoes , ' she explains			2
' i remember one wedding , of @entity268 and @entity269 , on february 15			0
she is happily jumping about in her comfortable @entity240 , and he is turning into an icicle in his fashionable shoes			0
' he says to me , ' she 's lucky , she 's got her feet warm			0
but i am getting frozen here '			0
' @entity30 says she now has to pass on her words of weather wisdom to the @entity7 men before they go for their photo shoots , with some unusual fashion tips thrown in			1
she says : ' i tell them to take good hats as their ears go bright red within seconds of being outside			1
also the make - up should n't only be about the brides , and grooms too should put some tone on their noses and ears			1
' we also take tea with brandy , or tea with ginger and lemon -- it helps , but not for long			0
' and with another laugh she adds : ' the best way to protect yourself against the freezing temperature is a beautiful skiing costume but no bride would go for that			0

winter in @entity7 lasts for nine months and is *bitterly* cold
brides are forced to wear boots and thermals under their dresses
even with this and coats , most struggle to stay outside for over 10 minutes
top photographer @entity30 carries tea with *whiskey* for brides
even grooms have to apply make up as noses turn bright red in seconds
nevertheless the snow provides a stunning backdrop for wedding snaps
