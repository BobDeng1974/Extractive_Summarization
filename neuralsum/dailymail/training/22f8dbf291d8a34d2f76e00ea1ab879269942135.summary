@entity0 saw @entity1 show his undying love for his favourite @entity3 , and the @entity5 captain led his team to a ' shameful ' performance at @entity10 in the @entity11			1
most @entity5 fans will tell you the truth – @entity3 was at his influential brilliant best leading the @entity5 out of the darkness of the championship			1
since then he 's been out of his depth , yet still @entity1 's love for @entity3 burns strong			0
so after a 4 - 0 defeat and being dumped out of the @entity11 – yet another embarrassing exit after last season 's disasters at @entity23 and @entity24 – the @entity5 manager blamed injuries , implying his squad is n't big enough ( same excuse after last season 's @entity11 defeat )			1
this is just two weeks after the transfer window closed			0
@entity1 's @entity5 crashed out of the @entity11 at the hands of @entity10 on saturday @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 walk off dejected at the end of @entity5 's 4 - 0 loss at @entity10 @entity3 looks increasingly out of his depth and was again exposed on saturday at the @entity38 the @entity5 ' schedule has been no more taxing than most other clubs			1
in fact wednesday 's game at @entity42 was @entity5 's first midweek game for a month			0
why did @entity1 's team look so tired and out of sorts ? @entity10 had also played on wednesday night yet looked full of energy			1
sounds like bad management to me			0
when asked after those two cup shockers last season if he was prepared to apologise to fans , @entity1 replied : ' for what ? ' after the @entity38 horror show chairman @entity54 and keeper @entity9 both said sorry to fans			2
@entity1 was unwilling to apologise to @entity5 fans despite the humiliating @entity11 exit @entity5 chairman @entity54 ( right ) apologised to the 5,000 travelling @entity5 fans afterwards @entity54 tweeted an apology for @entity5 's ' disappointing ' performance at the @entity38 goalkeeper @entity9 ( right ) looks on as @entity10 's @entity61 opens the scoring in saturday 's @entity11 tie the @entity65 goalkeeper described the team 's performance as ' shameful ' @entity1 's unwillingness to empathise with supporters and his failure to apologise to them are signs of a manager who refuses to engage in the emotional side of the game and has no interest in developing any kind of understanding or relationship with the fans			1
@entity1 is only interested in doing the job			0
and on saturday he failed miserably at it			0
@entity5 have improved this season , there have been good signings and some good football			0
but as i wrote in an article for @entity88 recently , @entity5 is a football club ready to burst on to the big time			1
that 's the direction they want to head in			0
they need a manager who shares that ambition , and whose skills reflect the extraordinary salary he 's receiving ( at the last count @entity1 was the 13th highest - paid manager in the world , earning more than @entity99 and @entity100 )			1
what @entity5 do n't need is a manager who moans about the squad size			2
the @entity5 are heading to a world - class stadium and they need to go there with a world - class manager			2
time for @entity5 to let @entity1 go .			2

@entity5 were humiliated 4 - 0 by @entity10 in the @entity11 on saturday
but manager @entity1 showed no empathy for the @entity5 fans
club are ready to become a major player with @entity116 move
they now need a manager who reflects that growing ambition
