those who were there are hardly likely to forget some of the more shameful scenes			0
fans on both sides , as well as neutral bystanders , can only hope that the return of @entity9 football ’s most intense rivalry does n’t create the kind of febrile fury that rained down from the steep slopes of @entity13 almost 16 years ago			1
‘ i know what this game can be like , i remember 1999 , ’ says @entity14 , the former @entity15 winger , before quickly adding : ‘ but i do n’t think sunday will be like that - i hope not			1
‘ it ’s fair to say that was the most volatile game i have been involved in			1
anything that could happen did happen that day , on and off the field			1
@entity15 ' @entity14 celebrates scoring the opening goal during the game on may 2 against @entity25 @entity14 put @entity15 on their way to a 3 - 0 win over @entity25 away from home in an iconic @entity9 rivalry tie @entity14 also scored the third goal as @entity25 lost 3 - 0 in @entity9 football 's most intense rivalry 13 mins : @entity32 slides in @entity33 on the left wing and his cross is touched past @entity36 by @entity14 to hand @entity15 an early lead			1
@entity25 ’s defence , including on - loan @entity39 , is nowhere			1
31 mins : @entity25 defender @entity41 , who has already been booked , reacts badly to a tackle by @entity14 and is sent off by @entity43			1
@entity44 has to be dragged off the park			0
41 mins : a minute after a fan runs on the pitch , a coin is flung from the stands and hits @entity50 , flooring the whistler			0
his cut forehead later needs four stitches			0
43 mins : @entity50 recovers and awards a penalty to @entity15 after @entity57 is adjudged to have pulled @entity58 back in the box , prompting some more fans to invade the pitch			1
@entity62 converts the spot kick			0
53 mins : @entity25 keeper @entity36 is only booked despite handling the ball outside the box			1
@entity36 is one of 10 players cautioned throughout the sorry proceedings			2
76 mins : @entity70 ’s side seal the match - and the title - @entity14 nets his second goal of the evening after sprinting clear of the floundering @entity25 defence			1
86 mins : @entity15 striker @entity33 is shown a red card for a furious reaction to @entity57 ’s late challenge on him			1
90 mins : @entity57 is shown the third red card for a second booking after a lunge on @entity58 beside the corner flag			0
full time : @entity15 players celebrate winning the title at the home of their fierce rivals for the first time by indulging in their own verson of the @entity88			1
missiles are thrown as they make their way to the dressing room			0
‘ i am confident it wo n’t get to that stage			0
there were a lot of things that happened away from the park that day that you do n’t see but , in terms of the actual game , it was one of the most eventful @entity104 games in memory			2
’ the notoriety of that may clash at @entity13 has endured well enough , although it ’s still worth recalling some of the key facts surrounding the title - clinching 3 - 0 win for the visitors			1
none of it makes for pretty reading			0
more than 100 fans were arrested			1
three players - @entity25 ’s @entity41 , @entity57 and @entity15 ’ @entity33 - were sent off			1
referee @entity43 was left bloodied by a missile thrown from the crowd , then had the windows of his home smashed afterwards			0
one man was stabbed outside the ground , while others sustained injuries in the battles that followed the game			2
there were pitch invaders , a victorious @entity15 team mocking the @entity25 huddle – and being pelted with missiles for their cheek – while it all ended with multiple inquiries and , in the best tradition , questions in the @entity136			1
which rather puts @entity138 and @entity139 snarling at each other on the touchline in perspective , does n’t it ? @entity14 , whose two goals - allied to a @entity62 penalty - were overshadowed by the atrocious scenes , was brave enough to admit after the game that he ’d been frightened for his own personal safety			1
he echoed the thoughts of a vast majority when he said : ‘ sunday is a huge fixture but , because there has not been a game of this magnitude for a number of years , the most important thing is it passes safely			2
‘ that ’s the biggest concern			0
i do n’t know if it will be harder to police because it is a neutral venue			0
if it was a home game then the away fans can be shepherded in			2
but hopefully it can be a good event , as it ’s one that ’s been sorely missed			0
’ the good news for all is that , while anyone who saw the ring of police surrounding the pitch for the closing stages of that game in 1999 might have considered this fixture beyond reprisal , it did recover			2
as ugly as it has been at times , as horrible as the atmosphere may be in bar rooms and front rooms beyond the control of police and stewards , we have n’t seen anything approaching that level of trouble since			0
@entity25 's @entity41 , who was sent off during the 3 - 0 defeat , clashes with @entity15 winger @entity14 more than 100 fans were arrested that day as @entity15 won 3 - 0 at @entity13 @entity25 : @entity36 , @entity191 , @entity39 , @entity192 , @entity57 , @entity41 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 subs : @entity200 , @entity199 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 sent off : @entity41 ( 31 ) , @entity57 ( 90 ) @entity15 : @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity58 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity62 , @entity14 , @entity209 , @entity33 , @entity210 subs : @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 sent off : @entity33 ( 86 ) goals : @entity14 ( 12 , 76 ) , @entity62 ( 44 pen ) attendance : 59,918 there are dark murmurings ahead of sunday , of course , with some wondering what might happen if – and it ’s a possibility – a very strong @entity25 side simply steamroller their opponents			1
‘ i ’m not saying that is going to happen , ’ said @entity14 , when asked about he subject of any on - field events provoking violence			1
‘ it comes down to supporters having a responsibility			0
you can never account for everyone but the most important thing is the safety aspect			0
‘ hopefully everyone can enjoy the occasion and welcome back the @entity104 fixture			0
’ enjoyment for those blessed / cursed to spend their lives supporting one side or the other is , of course , entirely dependent upon how their team fare			0
it ’s hardly outrageous to suggest that optimism is more prevalent among @entity25 than @entity15 supporters at present			1
@entity14 conceded : ‘ @entity15 are in real trouble at the moment			1
the sides are worlds apart in terms of the performances on the pitch			0
it could be really tough for @entity15			2
‘ you just want to see @entity15 back for the good of @entity9 football			2
we knew this game would come around			2
we would have liked to see it in the top league but it ’s the cup and one team are going in very strong and another who are a lot weaker			0
‘ but i still believe @entity15 have guys in that squad who , if they get things right tactically , there is a chance an upset could happen			1
@entity25 ’s @entity41 , @entity57 and @entity15 ’ @entity33 were all sent off as @entity14 's side won 3 - 0 referee @entity43 was hit by a missile thrown from the crowd then had the windows of his home smashed ‘ i say upset because the odds are massively against @entity15 , because of the way things are at the moment			1
‘ @entity285 has to be well prepared and get the players ready for it			2
he needs to get a level of performance out of them that ’s a lot higher than we have seen this season			0
‘ at this moment you ’ve got to fear the worst - but you never know			2
@entity25 are a strong side and they have a lot of confidence and swagger			2
but @entity15 fans will still expect a performance and a result though , regardless			1
‘ the phrase “ nothing to lose ” does n’t apply in an @entity104 game			2
you could say a lot of people might not expect you to get a result - but there ’s always something to lose in an @entity104			2
‘ i ’ve experienced both sides			0
i was on the end of a hiding after the 6 - 2 game at @entity13			1
that was n’t good , i locked myself away for a week until the storm passed			0
i ’ve been on the other side after winning			0
‘ it does n’t matter how you go into the match , whether you are strong and in form , it can never be viewed as a meaningless match			0
it does n’t matter if they have n’t played for a few years			0
it ’s still @entity25 v @entity15 and there is so much history			1
the game in may of 1999 was among the most fierce between @entity327 's two intense rivals @entity14 was a feature of the day but even the @entity15 man admits anything could happen on and off the pitch ‘ you can never be ready for it unless you ’ve experienced it , no matter what advice you get from the guys who have played in it 20 times			1
nothing prepares you for when you walk out			0
’ the atmosphere on sunday may surpass almost anything experienced by even hardened @entity104 fans in the modern era , with absence having hardened the edge on a rivalry that has always been on the keen side of sharp , to say the very least			0
for the love of all that is still bonny about the beautiful game , let ’s all hope that the heat and noise at @entity352 is contained , controlled and kept within the bounds of acceptable responsibility			0
however the game itself goes , the last thing @entity9 football needs is even a handful of half - wits deciding to rammy like it ’s 1999 .			1

@entity25 and @entity15 played on may 2 , 1999 , when three players were sent off and more than 100 fans were arrested
@entity15 won 3 - 0 with two goals from winger @entity14 at @entity13
@entity14 admits it was the ' most volatile game i have been involved in ' as ' anything that could happen did happen that day , on and off the field '
