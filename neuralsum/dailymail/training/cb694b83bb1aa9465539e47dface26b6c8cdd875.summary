the wonderful thing about having older children is that they change from travel dependents to travel companions			0
my 19 - year - old daughter @entity5 i seem to have missed out on the ski bunny gene ( unlike other family members ) , so we wanted to find an exciting short - haul getaway with minimal travel and maximum show - stopping thrills			1
the trouble with being out of season is that any traditional hot - spots are out of the question , yet anywhere else takes too long to get to for a five day break			2
tv presenter @entity18 and her 19 - year - old daughter @entity5 visited @entity20 for five days as it turns out , @entity21 now offer weekly flights direct to @entity20 in @entity23 from @entity24 , flying out on saturday and returning on wednesday , which was ideal for us			1
i visited @entity20 many moons ago as a reporter for @entity29			1
i fell in love with the vibrancy of the frenetic souks , as well as the pungent scents and vivid colours of local life , and vowed i would return someday			1
@entity5 had never been there , and i wondered what it would be like wandering around with such a willowy beauty - would i be deluged with offers of 2,000 camels for her and forced to beat them off with sticks ? @entity18 visited @entity20 many moons ago as a reporter for @entity29 and wanted to revisit the busy city they stayed for two nights in a beautiful riad with an open courtyard walking distance from the main square luckily , i did n't have to worry			1
@entity20 today is still like something from a film set , and the locals are just delightful			1
we stayed for the first two nights in one of the many beautiful riads , or bijou hotels , with a glorious open courtyard			0
we wanted to be within walking distance from the @entity63 , @entity20 's main square , which is the perfect starting point to explore the city			1
by day , the colourful square is a bustling hub of carpet sellers , snake charmers , musicians and even a tooth puller ( yes really ! )			0
@entity18 and @entity5 ride on camels during their trip to northwest @entity74 , just a short flight from the @entity76 they took the wise decision to hire a guide to show them around so they would n't miss any ' hidden gems ' at night , however , it takes on a truly magical appearance with twinkling lights , a myriad of pop - up restaurants , henna artists , performing monkeys , fire eaters and story tellers - set amid the pungent smell of incense			1
we loved it , and i wondered how it was possible for one location to appear so different within the space of 24 hours ? on our first day we took the wise decision to hire a guide to show us around and allow us to get our bearings a little			0
the duo visited @entity103 , @entity104 , and the @entity105 & @entity106 @entity107 from @entity108 was brilliant , and although she was n't cheap she was worth every dirham			0
as well as covering all the major important sights - @entity110 , @entity104 , and the @entity105 & @entity112 - she also gave us a flavour of local life that we 'd never have discovered on our own			2
these hidden local gems included the shared underground ovens , a hamam furnace attendant who played his lute and offered us delicious mint tea and tiny pieces of thread tied to the church railings by people hoping to cure their various ailments			2
the locals were friendly and genuinely kind , and respectful when we did n't want to buy any of their wares			0
they had so very little , it seemed , but wanted to share their bread with anyone who needed or wanted to try it			0
the colourful square is a bustling hub of carpet sellers , snake charmers , musicians and even a tooth puller with many restaurants vying for our attention , we were relieved to have a couple of excellent recommendations for dinner			0
@entity142 and @entity143 are both visually stunning , and serve a delicious selection of authentic local dishes with a little belly dancing thrown in for good measure			0
if shopping was a sport , i am its @entity151 , and for me , this was manna from heaven			0
the markets were overflowing with beautiful lamps , gorgeous fabrics and carpets , intricate jewellery and metalwork , fine leather slippers ; the list was endless , but sadly my purse was not			0
after two days of pounding the streets , and all the associated sights and sounds , our next destination was a very welcome five star retreat set a little distance from @entity20 's bustling @entity168			1
@entity18 says she is a champion of shopping and markets were full of lamps , gorgeous fabrics and carpets just 20 - minute drive from the @entity20 's centre , @entity174 is a breathtaking , romantic retreat with its own unique style and sense of tranquility			1
it was here where we tried our first hamam , a kind of giant sauna , where you are placed on a hot slab , washed by hand in black soap , and scrubbed until you feel as if your skin might fall off - before realising that it actually has			1
but although it sounds revolting , my skin has never felt so soft			0
after another cup of mint tea it was time for bed , and the most marshmallow - comfortable beds we 've ever slept in			2
next morning we were invited to attend a cookery lesson with @entity200 , a rather rotund and jovial chef ( just as they should be ) , to teach us how to prepare a ' tagine ' - a delicious @entity204 dish that 's typically made with chicken or lamb			2
local herbs , spices and fruits are added and cooked slowly for a number of hours , making the meat melt - in - the - mouth tender			2
dinner was at the retreat 's beautiful @entity215 - inspired restaurant , which was followed by a movie in the private cinema - complete with popcorn			0
@entity23 was a truly magical experience that came to an end far too soon , and a wonderful mother - daughter trip that , turns out , is right on our doorstep			1
@entity18 stayed at : @entity224 www.riad-idra-marrakech.com and @entity226 and @entity227 www.tigmiza.com ; for more information @entity228 www.travellink.ma			2

@entity18 and 19 - year - old daughter @entity5 visit @entity23 for five days
after visiting @entity20 years ago as a reporter @entity18 was keen to return
they walked around souks , had their first hamam and rode on camels
