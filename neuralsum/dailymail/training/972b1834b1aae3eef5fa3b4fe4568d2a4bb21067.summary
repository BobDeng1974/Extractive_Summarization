thanks to @entity1 , the prospectus for @entity3 has been released to the public for the first time ever , after the polarizing television and radio host won them in an auction earlier this year			1
the plans , which @entity10 and his brother @entity11 used to raise the $ 17 million required to build the park , show a park that looks remarkably similar to the one today			1
drawn in 1953 , two years before the park opened in @entity18 , @entity19 , in 1955 , the map lays out popular attraction such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity24 's castle			2
' of course , not all of @entity10 's ideas for the park came to fruition			1
the @entity45 was a corporate - sponsored attraction that would show how aluminum was made , and eventually became part of @entity21 when the park opened in july of 1955			0
lilliputian land , which was inspired by @entity50 , would have featured 9 - inch - tall singing and dancing mechanical people living in a miniature @entity54 town			0
the main attractions of this land would have been a ride on a 17 - inch - tall locomotive and a barge that took visitors though the canals of the world , according to pages released on @entity64			2
map : a look at the layout of @entity3 as envisioned by @entity10 back in 1953 through the years ; a look at @entity3 when it first opened ( left ) , in 1960 ( center ) and today ( right ) show the park has changed very little , and looks remarkably similar to @entity10 's original plans the park would become so successful upon its opening , that ten years later , @entity10 developed the idea to build four more parks in @entity75			1
unfortunately , he passed away of lung cancer in 1967 before he could see any of them completed			0
@entity79 , the first of the four , opened to the public in 1971 .			0
