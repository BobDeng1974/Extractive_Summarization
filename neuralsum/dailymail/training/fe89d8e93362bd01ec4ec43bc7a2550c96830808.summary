@entity0 , whois facing jail for molesting a woman who used his insemination services a ‘ narcissistic ’ academic who claims to have fathered 58 children as a private sperm donor is facing jail for molesting a woman who used his services			1
professor @entity10 , 51 , set up a ‘ one - stop shop ’ on the internet to artificially inseminate women who were desperate to start a family			1
he visited them at home and pretended to be trying to help them , but instead he was ‘ sexually motivated ’ to embark upon a ‘ breeding programme ’ , a court heard			1
the neuroscientist , an expert in maternal and foetal medicine , was found guilty of sexually assaulting one woman who used his services and was cleared of abusing two others			1
@entity23 in @entity24 heard that @entity0 advertised his services online under a false name and carried out home visits around the country			1
he carried a ‘ donation kit ’ with him containing a dvd player so he could watch pornography , rubber gloves and laboratory equipment			0
but he was arrested after three women complained that he had sexually assaulted them			1
@entity0 , who worked at @entity34 , @entity24 , once gave an interview in which he described being a sperm donor as ‘ like a hobby or charitable act ’ and said that he got ‘ satisfaction by helping ’			0
he also said that he offered his services as a donor and as a doctor because he ‘ loved children ’ and wanted others to enjoy parenthood			2
@entity45 , prosecuting , told jurors : ‘ you have to ask yourselves what kind of woman agrees to meet a complete stranger for artificial insemination : someone who is desperate and is prepared to put up with the potential embarrassment and humiliation and who has kept the details from their friends and families			2
‘ a perfect victim for sexual assault , someone unlikely to complain			0
‘ compare the women to this defendant , someone who has traded on the fact he is a doctor and paraded his scientific knowledge , impressing them with his apparent expertise			0
what kind of man embarks on a breeding programme to have as many children as possible ? ‘ you may feel there is a high degree of narcissism in what he has done and that he is sexually motivated in some of these transactions			2
’ his victim told the court that @entity0 had visited her at home after she contacted him			0
she said she went along with his request for her to perform a sex act on him on several occasions because she had been trying to conceive for a year and was desperate for success this time			0
mr @entity45 said he sexually assaulted her , adding : ‘ she told him three or four times not to touch her , but he went ahead regardless			2
@entity23 , pictured , in @entity24 heard that @entity0 advertised his services online under a false name and carried out home visits around the country ‘ he was not the altruistic donor , but someone who is sexually motivated			1
’ @entity0 , of @entity93 , was convicted of two counts of sexually assaulting the woman and was released on bail until september 30 for a pre-sentence report			1
two other women , both 26 - year - old lesbians , also told the court the defendant abused them – which he denied , but the jury were unable to reach verdicts on this			0
@entity0 is a qualified doctor in @entity104 , but has never practised medicine and is not registered with the @entity106			2
following his arrest , 15 women who had children by him came to his defence , including a police officer , a maths teacher and a lecturer			0
his conviction on june 27 could not be reported until now because the @entity115 was considering a retrial over eight charges relating to alleged assaults on the lesbians , but it has now decided not to proceed .			0
