the @entity1 and @entity2 will be welcoming their second baby in april 2015 , @entity0 has confirmed			1
@entity2 's pregnancy was announced last month but the due date had not been released until now			1
in a statement , the palace said the 32 - year - old @entity2 , who is around fourteen weeks pregnant , continued to suffer from extreme morning sickness but her condition was ' steadily improving '			1
the royal couple 's second baby will be fourth in line to the throne , behind one - year - old @entity22 , who was born in july last year			1
@entity2 recently took refuge with her parents while she was ' struggling terribly ' with her debilitating antenatal sickness			1
the royal retreated to her family home in @entity28 , @entity29 , last week with her son , @entity22			1
sources said the @entity2 ' has n't been at all well ' as she battles hyperemesis gravidarum , which causes severe vomiting in expectant mothers			1
illness : @entity2 , 32 , is around fourteen weeks pregnant with her second child , and has taken refuge with her parents and @entity22 due to her antenatal sickness her mother @entity40 has apparently helped to take charge of her recovery and has been researching alternative sickness cures , such as herbal tea , on the internet			1
and despite the presence of @entity48 nanny @entity47 , mrs @entity40 has also been taking @entity22 off her daughter 's hands			0
she has been seen in local shops with her 15 - month - old grandson , prompting one startled assistant to write on @entity54 : ' served @entity2 's mum and @entity22 today at work			1
he is gorgeous ! ' the @entity2 says she feels far more relaxed at the @entity59 's £ 5million @entity58 mansion , @entity60 , than at @entity0			1
baby number two : @entity2 was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with @entity22 one source told the @entity66 : ' @entity2 is feeling so lousy that she just wanted to be with her family and out of public view			1
' she is extremely close to @entity40 , who is very much a hands - on grandmother			0
between her and their nanny , @entity70 , @entity2 has all the help she needs with @entity22 while she is feeling so sick			1
' and @entity28 is somewhere she can just relax and be herself			1
' @entity73 – who has now returned to @entity74 – has not been seen in public since palace officials were forced to announce her pregnancy last month , several weeks earlier than intended due to her sickness			2
@entity2 was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with @entity22			1
but doctors have been better prepared this time and may , some medical experts have suggested , even have treated her with a drip at home			2
a source added : ' do n't be fooled by the fact that she has n't been admitted to hospital this time			2
she is just as poorly			0
the difference is that her doctors have been able to diagnose and treat her quicker			0
she really has n't been at all well , though			0
' @entity73 was forced to cancel her first solo overseas visit – a trip to @entity95 – last month because of the severity of her condition			2
last fortnight she also reluctantly cancelled a visit to a project by @entity101 in @entity74 and several other forthcoming engagements have now been scratched out of her diary			0
@entity104 , of the charity @entity105 , said : ' @entity106 is not morning sickness			1
it is a chronic and debilitating condition that can cause sufferers to vomit up to 30 times a day			2
' @entity106 affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies			0
the condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘ pregnancy hormone ’ @entity115 , or human chorionic gonadotropin , which increases after conception			2
it causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration , weight loss and a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine , called ketosis			0
it is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers			0
the severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day , with exhausting and hazardous consequences			2
they can not eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week			0
it can trigger a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food			0
hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux , where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat			0
hospital treatment for these women is essential , as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated			0
treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration , as well as supplementation of vitamin b , one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition			0
an intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice			0
the condition can also affect the baby ’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight			2
in severe cases , the sickness can trigger a miscarriage .			0
