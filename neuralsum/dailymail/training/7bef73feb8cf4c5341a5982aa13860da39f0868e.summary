bride - to - be @entity0 spotted the wedding dress of her dreams and knew she had to have it			1
there was just one problem - she needed to lose 5st to fit into the a-line dress			2
@entity0 weighed 15st 4lb and was a size 16 when she spotted the dress but discovered it was only made in a size 8			1
@entity0 , 25 , said : ' when i saw the dress , i just knew that i had to have it			2
' the fact that it was only available in a size 8 was just the incentive i needed to really transform my life and get back into shape			1
' i wanted a wedding album that i could be proud of and i knew the only way i was going to be able to achieve my goal was to fit into that dress			2
' @entity0 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , said : ' i had always put on a weight quite easily and needed to be careful what i ate			2
a chronic snacker , on a bad day @entity0 would eat whole pack of @entity35 @entity0 was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling ' i am the type of person who can easily put on 4lb over the course of a weekend if eating lots of fattening things and having ice cream for dessert			1
' i noticed my weight creeping up and obviously that affected my general self - esteem			0
' i put on a lot of weight after the birth of my eldest son			0
you are told when you are pregnant that you can eat for two , but that is a complete myth			0
' you only need a few more calories in the very late stages of the pregnancy but otherwise you should just eat as you would normally			0
' i put on a stone and a half throughout the pregnancy and i did n't lose it after my son was born			2
' she was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling			0
her doctor said the falls were because of her weight			0
@entity0 's final trigger which encouraged to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the @entity70 switching to a healthier low - fat diet , cutting out the snacking and beginning to exercise saw the pounds fall off the final trigger which encouraged her to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the @entity70			2

i knew i had to change			0
' mother - of - two @entity0 had bought the dress last august and when she finally tied the knot in may this year - just nine months later - she was a shapely size 8 weighing just 9st 12lb			1
she had lost a staggering 76lb , or 5st 4lb , - more than half a stone a month - and got the body she had always wanted			1
@entity0 achieved this feat by completely changing her diet and exercising regularly			1
she had previously snacked throughout the day and was incapable of just having one of her favourite @entity93 - on a bad day , she could munch her way through a whole packet			1
@entity0 was able to fit into her dream dress just nine months after buying it four sizes too small her other downfall was bread - she would eat five or six slices alongside her evening meal			1
@entity0 switched to a healthier low - fat diet , cut out the snacking and started eating low - calorie bread			1
she also started taking @entity108 capsules which she says helped take the edge off her appetite at weak moments and gave her extra energy to exercise more			0
and if she ever needed an extra incentive to carry on with the diet , she just looked at the white dress in the cupboard and dreamed of the day she would be able to fit into it			1
@entity0 said she felt like a new woman as she got back into shape			0
she said : ' once i put my mind to it , i found it quite straightforward			0
@entity0 says her wedding day was the ' happiest ' of her life and that she loved looking at the pictures afterwards ' the @entity128 capsules were a big help			1
i started walking a lot and they gave me real energy and helped me to get out more			0
' at the end of her weight loss journey @entity0 was finally at the right weight to fit into her wedding dress			1
' it meant so much to me , ' she said			0
' the dress fitted me perfectly and looked just as wonderful when i had bought it as a size 16 all those months ago			1
' my wedding day was the happiest of my life and i loved looking at the pictures afterwards			2
' i had the wedding album i had always dreamed of			0
