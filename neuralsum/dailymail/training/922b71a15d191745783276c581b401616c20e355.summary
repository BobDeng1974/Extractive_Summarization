by @entity0 an anti-abortion movement appeared to encourage the kidnapping of women bound for abortion clinics before quickly backtracking amid a torrent of complaints			1
first posted to @entity10 on @entity12 ’s @entity10 page by ‘ praying for you , ’ the message encouraging volunteers to kidnap abortion - ready women went viral and has forced the activist group to distance itself from the comments			1
the post encouraged people to volunteer for shuttles meant to take women safely to and from abortion doctors , and to preach to them and drop them off at churches instead of clinics			2
damage control : @entity24 scrambled to distance itself from the suggestion , but made sure to sling some mud while doing so the post asked people to share an email address being used by pro-choice group @entity30 for volunteers to sign up as shuttle drivers in @entity33			1
‘ i ’m not suggesting you actually take a woman to an abortion clinic , ’ the post reads , ‘ but it ’s a wonderful opportunity to minister to an abortion - minded woman for an hour while you do n’t take her to her clinic			1
’ ‘ even if you ca n’t change her mind by the time she gets out of your car and realizes she is at a church and not the clinic , she ’s missed her appointment anyway , ’ the post continues			1
@entity55 was not able to reach the @entity30 for comment , the group has not spoken publicly about the online posting			2
the shocking suggestion has been sent around the world and back many times by pro-choice groups warning @entity62 about possible kidnappings			2
the @ @entity65 twitter account tweeted a screen grab of the post with the caption ‘ this really alarmed us this morning , just one reminder that getting an abortion in @entity33 can be very dangerous			1
’ the posting has stretched from @entity10 and @entity74 to @entity75 and beyond , the @entity77 response to a @entity79 post showing the inflammatory message suggests that such action could be considered a felony in the @entity33			1
very active : @entity83 routinely protests outside of abortion clinics the post has been deleted from @entity83 ’s @entity10 page , but a screen grab of the message was reposted and received a flood of negative comments			1
‘ y'all know this is kidnapping , right ? ’ wrote the person who re-posted it			2
‘ that 's a felony , and since it 's pre-meditated , have fun in prison			2
’ the group immediately backed down from the message , but not without a fight			2
‘ ’ yes we deny that we support it			0
kidnapping and abortion are wrong for the same reasons , they both violate the inherent rights and dignity of other human beings			0
’ @entity83 ’s comparison of abortion to kidnapping only further fanned the flames			0
‘ we just hate you , ’ one person responded			0
‘ sorry to hear you 're so full of hate , ’ the group responded to a negative comment			0
‘ not surprising considering you advocate murder			0
we love you anyway though			0
’ after a lengthy back and forth during which @entity83 accused the grab ’s poster of slander and libel and even mocked her usage of ‘ y’all , ’ the poster suggested the group ‘ lawyer up and sue ’ her			1
peaceful resistance : the group preaches not to incite violence against people on either side of the abortion debate the group does not appear ready to take her to court , and instead put out an entirely separate post accusing @entity142 for you of being ‘ a fake group created by some pro-abortion rights people who are seeking to create a false story to cast aspersions on anti-abortion activists			1
’ this did little to stem the negative tide , but once again the group aggressively attacked the intelligence of those against it			0
‘ the lack of intellectual integrity some of you are demonstrating the last few days is truly astonishing , ’ @entity83 said in a comment			0
the amount of negative publicity and vitriol directed at @entity83 has failed to prove one thing , any link the group actually has to an organized kidnapping effort			0
@entity33 officials have not reported any abortion - related kidnappings .			0

the *original* post was made to *pro-life* group @entity170 's @entity10 page by a third - party
it was quickly deleted , but a screen grab was re-posted by another @entity10 user
the group denied any *responsibility* and distanced itself from the suggestion while at the same time taking shots at *detractors*
