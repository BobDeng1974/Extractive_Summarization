it seems @entity2 's brother or sister is driving consumer sales and shopping trends even before he or she is born			0
in an effort to emulate the duchess of @entity10 's seemingly effortless pregnancy style and grace , mothers - to - be are flocking to have their own pregnancy captured , with a 43 per cent rise in ' bump portraits '			2
so desperate are they to copy @entity8 's pre-natal look that some women are even coming into the photography studio clutching pictures of the young royal , hoping to exactly mimic her hands - under - the - bump pose			1
the photographic styling and age - group representative of this demand also suggests that the increase has been down to the ' @entity48 '			1
demand for ' bump portraits ' has been particularly marked amongst mothers - to - be in their 30s , with a 57 per cent increase in orders from this age group			2
@entity55 , 38 , who is eight months pregnant , adopts a protective pose such as those loved by @entity8 @entity8 's demure yet elegant maternity fashion has inspired a move away from highly staged @entity60 reminiscent shots to very natural , traditional portraits , such as the picture of @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 , 8 months pregnant @entity8 's fashion choices during her first pregnancy with @entity2 were widely praised and expelled the idea that maternity wear meant tent - like dresses and elasticated waist bands			1
this , coupled with having seen @entity8 's pregnancy documented on camera at every stage , has inspired other women to make a lasting record of their own maternity journey			1
this is reflected in the style of portrait requested has also been significant , with a move away from highly staged @entity60 reminiscent shots to very natural , traditional portraits celebrating mothers ' individual looks , similar to the manner that we see the expectant @entity8 at public events			0
a number of pregnant women have even arrived at their shoots clutching pictures of @entity8 and her bump to recreate her specific pose and look			2
high fashion is now very much embraced by pregnant women ( such as @entity37 ) thanks to @entity8 's example a number of women have even arrived at their shoots clutching pictures of @entity8 and her bump to recreate her specific pose and look ( left : @entity55 , 38 , who is eight months pregnant ) @entity101 , @entity102 , said ; ' since november we have seen a notable increase in portraits of pregnant women at our studios - especially amongst those in their 30s			1
' women not only want to mark this important moment in their lives , they are also more confident about being themselves and maintaining their individual styles - even with a changing body shape			0
' @entity116 such as @entity8 who actually incorporate their bumps into their usual glamorous look has perhaps inspired women and reassured them that they can still look amazing and make the most of fashion even when pregnant			2
' the @entity8 effect also applies to the @entity8 's fashion choices with the £ 195 ' @entity125 ' coat by @entity126 which the @entity8 wore earlier this week having sold out @entity64 , 35 , a pr and portrait painter from @entity129 in @entity25 is four months pregnant and says the @entity42 inspired her to have a fashionable pregnancy and to capture it on camera			1
' after spending most of my adult life controlling my figure , the fact that your stomach is meant to stick out in pregnancy is an interesting shift in perspective ! ' it reminds you that what your body can do is so much more powerful than how it looks			0
' i have to say all the coverage of @entity8 being pregnant and glamorous inspired me to do the shoot			0
i did n't expect to still feel attractive when i was pregnant but it is still you , just you with a bump			0
' it is also easier at this early stage to look good as you can still mix and match your normal clothes with maternity things as @entity8 has been doing			0
