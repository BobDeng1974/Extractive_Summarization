@entity0 was left stunned by @entity2 ’s decision to drop him at the weekend and fears he faces an uphill struggle to persuade @entity4 to keep him at the end of the season			2
@entity4 manager @entity7 shocked the 29 - year - old by leaving him out of the 18 that lost at home to @entity11 and watched the game at @entity13 having received no explanation			1
it is understood that @entity0 and @entity7 did talk at training at @entity17 on monday , with the @entity19 coach telling the striker that the decision was made purely for tactical reasons			0
@entity0 is worried @entity4 wo n't offer him a permanent deal in the summer @entity2 ( left ) told @entity0 his omission against @entity11 on sunday was due to tactical reasons @entity0 ( left ) has scored only three times for the club this season during his loan spell from @entity30 604 - minutes played for @entity4 so far 3 - goals scored and three assists in all competitions 201.3 - minutes per goal			1
@entity35 leads the league on 70.33 £ 40,000 - @entity0 ’s daily wages £ 1.77m - cost of each of his @entity4 goals in wages , not including bonuses ( @entity42 of @entity44 ’s 18 goals has cost @entity45 £ 210,000 in wages ) however , @entity47 understands that @entity0 increasingly wonders if he will ever manage to truly impress @entity7 as he looks to persuade @entity4 to turn a one - year loan deal in to a permanent £ 43million transfer from @entity30 in the summer			1
@entity0 has been doing voluntary extra training at @entity4 after recovering from a calf injury that interrupted his progress in late autumn and is trying to turn himself in to a more rounded forward in the mould of captain @entity55			0
despite this , the @entity57 international believes that he sometimes has to do twice as much as other players to convince @entity7 of his worth and was particularly bemused in late november to hear his manager say repeatedly that he had to get fully match fit before he could return to the team			0
in @entity0 's absence , @entity55 ( left ) and @entity63 both failed to provide an attacking threat on sunday @entity0 is likely to replace @entity66 ( left ) up front against @entity68 after the @entity19 's injury on sunday as far as @entity0 was concerned , he was fit and the fact that another of @entity7 ’s summer signings @entity72 was returned straight to the starting line - up against @entity11 after almost two months out with a knee injury has not escaped his attention			1
@entity4 are currently paying @entity0 in excess of £ 280,000 - a - week on loan from @entity30 and must decide at the end of the season if they wish to make that move permanent			1
so far the former @entity83 and @entity84 star has scored three goals in the @entity86			0
@entity0 is likely to return to the team at @entity68 this weekend after news that the muscle injury suffered by @entity66 on sunday prevented him from travelling to the @entity91 ceremony on monday			0
‘ on the advice of club medical staff i am unable to fly , ’ said @entity92 on @entity93			0
@entity72 ( right ) started @entity4 's defeat on sunday - despite missing almost two months with a knee injury			2

@entity4 lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity11 in the @entity86
@entity0 was omitted from the 18 - man squad for sunday 's match
striker is on a one - year loan with an *option* to £ 43million summer deal
