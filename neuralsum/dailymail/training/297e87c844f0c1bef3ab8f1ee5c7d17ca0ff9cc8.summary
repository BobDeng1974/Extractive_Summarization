by @entity0 published : 20:11 est , 29 july 2012 updated : 20:11 est , 29 july 2012 @entity2 has come under pressure to follow @entity5 's example tighten border controls britons living in @entity5 face tough income tests as the debt - ridden country launches a crackdown on migrants			1
the move has led to demands from @entity16 mps for @entity2 to take a tougher approach to @entity19 nationals living in this country			2
earlier this month , @entity5 passed proposals for ‘ proof of income ’ and other tests			1
ministers hope to save 1billion euros ( £ 780million ) a year by forcing @entity19 citizens to meet strict criteria if they wish to stay for three months or more			1
migrants must prove they have either a job or enough money to support themselves , and if they are jobless , they must produce health insurance			0
if they can not supply the evidence , their application for residency in @entity5 may be rejected			0
it is unclear what effect the rules will have on those currently living in @entity5			2
currently , @entity19 directives say that those living in member states for more than three months should not become an ‘ unreasonable burden on social services ’			1
yesterday , former @entity45 immigration minister @entity44 told the @entity46 : ‘ we do have the power to deport @entity19 citizens – but they are ignored by the @entity7 authorities			1
we should heed the @entity5 example and change our approach			0
’ the @entity52 said yesterday it did not have figures for how many @entity19 nationals were removed because they could not support themselves			2
@entity16 mp @entity55 , a member of the @entity56 , said : ‘ this move drives a coach and horses through the freedom of movement principle and we should take inspiration from it			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity66 said : ‘ we carry out enforcement operations up and down the country every day and wherever we encounter someone breaking the rules , we will take steps to remove them			0
’ a new ministerial order , slipped out by the @entity5 government on july 9 , states that any @entity19 citizen living in @entity5 for more than three months must prove they will not become a financial burden on the @entity75 by producing a job contract or documents confirming they have enough money to support themselves			1
if they are jobless , they must also show they are covered by health insurance			0
the decree , which potentially affects thousands of @entity7 seeking a new life in the country , declares that @entity5 will now adopt a stricter interpretation of the ‘ free movement ’ principle			1
the @entity5 government has justified the measures by pointing to @entity93 7 of the 2004 @entity19 directive on free movement , which gives @entity19 member states the power to define it ‘ without prejudice to national border controls ’ – in other words , entry conditions can be imposed on other @entity19 citizens by member governments			1
tough times : @entity5 demonstrators take to the streets to protest against the country 's austerity measures the @entity7 has also enacted the provision – and the @entity52 insists that it does demand that @entity19 citizens should not be ‘ an unreasonable burden on public funds ’ before allowing them to stay in the @entity7			1
@entity5 is in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the @entity115 and is almost certain to require a bailout in the coming weeks			0
official figures released on friday show that unemployment has soared to a record 5.7 million – a staggering 24.6 per cent of the workforce			0
the centre - right government of prime minister @entity121 has introduced the new controls in an attempt to cut expenditure on health and social services			0
health minister @entity127 said recently that 700,000 foreigners had moved to @entity5 just to obtain free health care			0
the country has become a favourite destination for ‘ health tourists ’ from other @entity19 countries , attracted by short waiting lists , cheap treatment and excellent hospitals			1
under @entity19 law , citizens of member states are entitled to receive health care in any member country			2
but @entity5 authorities say their finances are being drained by the arrangement , with local media claiming @entity7 are the worst offenders			1
in contrast to the @entity5 regulations , @entity19 citizens coming to live in @entity7 do not need to register or take out health insurance			1
and the only requirement on those not in work is that they should not become an ‘ unreasonable burden ’ on public funds			0
a spokesman for the @entity154 in @entity155 said : ‘ you either must hold a job or have the means to support yourself to ensure that you do not become a burden on the @entity5 state			1
‘ those people who do not hold a job would have to show that they have contracted a medical insurance service to cover them during their stay in @entity5 , and also that they have the appropriate means to support themselves and any other member of their families			2
pensioners do not need medical insurance			0
’ a @entity171 spokesman said : ‘ this change simply brings @entity5 in line with many other @entity19 countries			1
the @entity7 @entity154 has issued guidance in @entity176 for @entity7 expatriates in @entity5 via its website			2
we understand the new rules will affect a relatively small number of expatriates			0
’ @entity7 holidaymakers would have borrowing limits on their credit cards lifted by the government if they were caught up in the collapse of the euro , under new plans			2
the move is one of a series of measures being considered by crisis - management teams in @entity194 , the @entity171 and the @entity195 following advice that @entity198 ’s exit from the single currency is ‘ near inevitable ’ – and could come before the end of the summer - holiday season			1
the deepening economic malaise on the @entity202 has led to the conclusion at the top of the government that there will soon be an ‘ orderly ejection ’ of @entity198 from the euro – probably with only a few days ’ notice			1
if this ‘ @entity212 ’ occurred in the height of the summer season , hundreds of thousands of @entity7 tourists could be stranded with euros that are no longer legal tender			1
cash machines could freeze and credit - card companies are unlikely to process transactions			0
the @entity7 @entity185 ’s primary aim would be to avoid panic by allowing @entity7 tourists to remain in @entity198 until the end of their holiday			2
proposed measures include offering taxpayer - backed guarantees to credit - card companies , enabling tourists to use the cards without borrowing limits			0
the companies would then be compensated for any losses			0
euros could also be exchanged for @entity230 on their return , with the @entity7 taxpayer again bearing the burden			0
a @entity171 source said : ‘ we will have a key role to play in making sense of a confusing situation			0
