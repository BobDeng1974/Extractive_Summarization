sir @entity0 has followed a fairly predictable path in his retirement			1
a bit of media work , plenty of endorsements and a range of bikes , available at good stockists everywhere			2
he has reportedly turned down @entity10 but this week he joined @entity11 as a sporting star with his own range of children 's books			1
flying @entity16 are the tales of a young boy who discovers a old rusty bike has magic powers that transport him to sporting success			1
in the build - up to @entity24 , it was @entity0 's rivals who wondered whether he and the @entity28 team had ' magic wheels ' , though the truth was his six @entity32 golds were achieved by an unmatched will to win and 27 inch thighs that powered him like pistons to sporting history			1
@entity0 celebrates an impressive cycling career with the @entity39 flag after yet more success @entity28 cyclist @entity0 poses during the reception for @entity43 and @entity44 athletes in @entity45 @entity0 's legacy is a cycling revolution that has changed the @entity28 sporting landscape but it has also created an expectation that success is now assured forever			1
in @entity53 - when @entity0 won three medals in a @entity52 won seven from ten golds , a feat that that prompted cycling 's governing body to change the rules for @entity45 to prevent such domination			1
and yet , three summers ago , @entity39 again won seven from ten @entity32 titles , including two more golds for @entity0			2
@entity0 celebrates after crossing the finish line to win the gold medal in the @entity24 however , at the recent track cycling @entity67 , @entity28 cyclists failed to top the podium in a single event - their worst performance in 14 years			1
they ranked tenth on the medal table with a haul of just three silver medals , their coach , @entity75 , later questioning their hunger to succeed			2
anyone who witnessed @entity0 's final and most thrilling @entity32 gold in the men 's keirin will know that timing is his strong point			1
and it certainly seems like he got out at the right time			0
@entity0 celebrates winning the men 's @entity85 final on day eleven of the @entity32 in @entity45 however , the 11 - time world champion insists it 's not really as grim as the statistics appear			1
some think the team has been missing a leader since his retirement and @entity0 believes the return to the track of sir @entity96 could be just what 's needed to lift the spirits			1
' he 's an iconic leader and other nations look to him as this global cycling megastar , ' he said			2
' when he 's in the track centre everybody 's focusing on him , so it takes the pressure and spotlight off some of the other riders who do n't particularly enjoy that attention			0
he 's invaluable for the team as a whole			0
' we lost a bit of experience after the @entity32 , after @entity111 and i retired			0
success creates its own problems and pressures			0
now , if you 're the @entity117 going into @entity118 , you 've a realistic chance of medalling in maybe 60 per cent of the events			0
' but in cycling now , unless it 's a gold medal , it is seen as being a massive failure and you 've got to manage expectations			1
' we do still have realistic chances but i do n't think we 'll have another @entity53 or @entity45 but i do n't think that 's a massive surprise or disappointment			0
i still think we have a successful games in @entity118 but with less medals than previous games			0
' @entity133 in @entity134 was disappointing , there 's no way you can spin it to make it sound like a success , as a team it was n't			2
' however , in individual cases and certain events , progress has been made since the @entity67 in @entity144 last year			0
' @entity0 speaks and people listen			2
this week he was back in @entity45 as part of his mentor role in a sports aid initiative backed by energy company @entity150			0
@entity0 in action during the men 's @entity152 @entity155 final on day 6 of the @entity24 a legacy project of last year 's @entity158 , @entity156 is providing 100 talented hopefuls with funding but , more importantly , invaluable advice and experience as they start out on their sporting careers			1
@entity32 silver medallist @entity164 , who famously mentored @entity165 , is guiding them while @entity32 gold medallist @entity166 is advising on nutrition and @entity168 is helping prepare their parents for what might come ahead			0
but it was @entity0 that had the teenagers listening in rapt attention and patiently queuing for the obligatory selfie with @entity39 's most successful olympian of all - time			1
when @entity0 made his @entity28 team debut at the 1993 @entity180 under - 23 championship he was told to return his tracksuit but times have changed			2
' it reminds me of what it was like when i was their age and you 've got your career right in front of you and the excitement that entails , ' he adds			0
@entity28 @entity32 track cycling gold medalist @entity0 poses with his @entity24 gold medals ' there was nothing like this programme when i was starting out , i definitely would have loved to be involved if there was			1
' i take my role as a mentor very seriously , it 's an honour , it 's not just about me speaking about myself and my experiences but i enjoy listening to the athletes and hearing about what they 're doing			0
' it 's exciting to think there could be half dozen or more of these athletes who could be household names in ten years			0
some might even match @entity0 's sporting and , perhaps , even literary achievements			1
' @entity150 's @entity156 programme partners with @entity212 to provide financial support and training to the sports stars of the future			0
keep up to date with the latest @ @entity217			0

sir @entity0 retired on a high after winning a gold medal at @entity24
cyclist has since released his own range of children 's books to the public
books are about @entity228 who finds a rusty bike with magic powers
