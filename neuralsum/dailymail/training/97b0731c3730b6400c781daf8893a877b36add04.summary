@entity152 ' has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else , ' the statement says			0
@entity166 and federal @entity167 officials cleared her to fly last week to @entity25 from @entity169 , and ' suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government - provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful , ' the family says			1
every day , the @entity3 sufferers in the @entity7 and their caregivers produce an astonishing eight 55 - gallon barrels of medical waste @entity176			1
masks , gloves , linens , utensils , medical instruments -- everything the patient contacts must be destroyed and the garbage is piling up			2
while one surefire way to destroy the pathogen is to incinerate the waste , some states have already said ' no way ' to requests they accept the tainted garbage			0

dr. @entity248 , head of the @entity249 , said those caring for @entity2 were vulnerable because some of their skin was exposed			2
the @entity167 is working on revisions to safety protocols			0
earlier ones , @entity248 said , were based on a @entity257 model for care in remote places , often outdoors , and without intensive training for health workers			0
' so there were parts about that protocol that left vulnerability , parts of the skin that were open , ' @entity248 said			0
health officials had previously allowed hospitals some flexibility to use available covering when dealing with suspected @entity3 patients			2

that 's like a do - it - yourself manual , ' @entity309 said			0
