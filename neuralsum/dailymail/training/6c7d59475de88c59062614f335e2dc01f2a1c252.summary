the woman at the center of the latest sex scandal to hit shamed @entity3 has admitted that @entity4 and @entity5 may be ‘ embarrassed ’ by her secret affair with the @entity8 mayoral candidate			1
@entity3 ’s wife @entity9 is one of @entity5 ’s closest aides and has been described as a ‘ second daughter ’ to the former secretary of state and her husband – while former president @entity14 officiated over the @entity16 ’ marriage in july 2010			1
and @entity17 , 23 , a political science student who had a lengthy furtive online affair with @entity3 , 48 , last year , told @entity20 exclusively : ‘ i have a feeling they do n't like me too much right now , because obviously @entity14 married them and @entity9 works with @entity5 very closely , so i 'm sure it ’s embarrassing			1
’ @entity3 has so far insisted he will not step down from the mayoral race , and when asked if the @entity27 should ask him to leave the party , @entity26 replied : ‘ i feel that most @entity27 , especially @entity30 women , do not want to be connected to someone like that			1
‘ @entity34 ’s already spoken out and i do n’t think he should be representing the party , i ’ll say that			2
i do feel he ’s a bad representation of the party			0
i do feel he ’s sexist and he does n’t even realize it , he ’s a sexist pig			0
she ’s extremely loyal , capable and she ’s been with @entity5 forever			1
‘ but there are now serious doubts as to why @entity9 would possibly put herself through this and what the benefits would be			1
‘ if the @entity51 phone @entity9 and say ‘ it ’s time , you have to protect yourself ’ , @entity3 will have to drop out of the campaign , and he will have to drop this public flagellation – he ’ll have no choice			1
’ @entity26 , who has spared no detail in discussing her affair with @entity3 and his obsession with her feet – as well as his fantasises about renting her a condo in @entity74 – added that she was certain that @entity9 was away with @entity5 during most of the times she spoke to the politician at his marital home			1
she said : ‘ i ’m assuming that @entity9 was away traveling with @entity5			1
i just would assume that he would n’t do that while she was there			0
he would just go right into his fantasy			0
’ the @entity51 are so close to @entity9 that they hosted a garden party for her wedding with more than 300 people at their @entity86 home in 2010 , with a massive buffet of @entity89 food and a sign with the couple 's wedding date , " 7 - 10 - 10 , " near the pool			1
' i have one daughter , ' said former president @entity14 as he gave @entity9 a hug , ' but if i had a second daughter , it would @entity9			1
' the striking brunette , who last week stunned onlookers as she spoke out to say she would be standing by her husband amid his latest sex scandal , has been been working as @entity5 's right hand since 1996 , and has been by her side through the @entity105 and presidential campaigns and move to the @entity107			1
she is also linked by many to join @entity5 on a potential 2016 campaign to bid for the @entity110			1
happily ever after - not quite : @entity3 and his wife @entity111 on their wedding day on july 10 , 2010 proud parents : @entity3 and wife @entity111 are parents to a 16 - month - old son called @entity117 giving a speech at the party , @entity5 told the crowd that it was ' love at first sight ' for @entity3			1
and a report at the time told how the @entity51 encouraged the match between the @entity127 beauty who grew up in @entity129 and the @entity130 @entity30 from @entity8			0
the couple represented , @entity4 said in his toast , what he wanted ' the future of the world to be '			2
however , the source said : ‘ their silence now is an expression of their support for @entity9 , but not for @entity3			1
’ like @entity9 , @entity5 stood by her man after revelations about his sexual relationship with intern @entity145 emerged in 1998			1
@entity3 's campaign has referred to the @entity14 scandal to convince @entity27 that voters can still support the mayoral candidate despite his indiscretions			2
and the source told @entity20 : ' the contrast between the @entity4 and @entity5 situation to this is that it concerned a @entity154 , it was prior to the midterm elections and there were a lot of policy issues on the line			1
' this was a presidency that had made a serious difference on all sorts of issues , there were matters facing the country at stake , there was an incentive for @entity5 to stand by her man			2
' by contrast here , he 's not in office and the future of the city is not at risk			0
as much as there is so much positive about @entity9 , it 's not like anyone needs her to be first lady of @entity8			2
she 's already being subjected to a @entity105 inquiry over work payment , it 's all above board and she has a right to earn a living , but you do have people now asking questions			0
' hopefully this wo n't be an issue for @entity5 , @entity9 should have a right to be part of any campaign she runs			1
' yesterday , @entity9 was visited by her mother @entity196 at her @entity8 home , while @entity3 was seen taking their 16 - month - old son @entity117 out for a walk			1
when asked why she thought why @entity3 wants to be mayor so badly , @entity26 said : ‘ i know he has a certainly amount of money from campaign funds and that he basically had to use it or lose it so to speak			2
so it was like , ‘ well , might as well run even if i ’m not going to win			0
i ’ve got all of this money to spend ’ and it just gets him more attention			0
’ crushingly , @entity26 said @entity3 never mentioned his wife during their liaison , and admitted that she had pondered whether their sex life was not so great , adding ‘ i would think a happily married man probably would n’t do that			1
i would want to think so anyway			0
‘ it was almost as if he wanted to pretend of that part of his life was n’t really happening			0
i never asked about her , i did n’t think that was appropriate			0
stand by your man : @entity9 addresses a news conference just hours after it was revealed he had been having an online affair with @entity17			1
she pledged to stay with her husband support : @entity196 arriving to @entity9 apartment to support her daughter in @entity8 ‘ he never told me he wanted to leave her , but he did hint at the fact there were some problems or some problems with her family regarding the first scandal and just embarrassment			1
i knew that everyone was upset by the first scandal			0
‘ he never said he felt bad , absolutely not			0
i think he feels bad when he gets caught or feels @entity9 ’s wrath , but i do n’t think he cares at all other than that			2
' interestingly , @entity26 said she believes that @entity3 may get a kick out of his sexting scandals being made public , adding : ‘ i have wondered that			2
he may secretly like the attention , like people knowing he can get all of these women to talk to him			0
he said in a press conference he could n’t even remember the exact number of women he had been talking to since he resigned from congress			0
‘ it kind of felt like he was bragging to me			0
i do think he gets a sexual kick out of being in the middle of this			0
i think he likes the attention , i think he ’s kind of an ego maniac			0
’ confessing that she feels ‘ very sorry ’ for @entity9 , @entity26 sniffed : ‘ i feel bad , but then again , i ’m not the one who ’s married to her			2
@entity3 should feel much worse than i do , i think anyway			2
close : former secretary of state @entity5 , pictured with @entity111 in march 2011 , has said she considers her to be like a daughter no mention : crushingly , @entity26 said @entity3 never mentioned his wife during their liaison ‘ i would just say i ’m sorry that she ’s hurt			1
i ‘ m , sorry she ’s embarrassed			0
if i could take it back , i would , but i ca n’t , so the only thing i can do now is just to apologize			0
‘ she ’s very beautiful , i think she ’s too good for him , i really do			2
that ’s what baffles me about them staying together			2
‘ i think she seems to be a very classy sophisticated woman			0
he ’s sleazy , a liar , not someone that you would think a woman like that would want to be married to , in my mind			0
and hugely dishonest , to say the least			0
