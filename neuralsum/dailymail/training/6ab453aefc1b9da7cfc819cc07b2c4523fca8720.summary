by @entity1 reporter published : 16:01 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 07:54 est , 21 september 2013 as if @entity5 leader @entity4 has n't enough on his plate , a @entity3 glitch saw him appear on screen with a @entity9 - style moustache today			1
only yesterday , @entity4 was accused of making racist and fascist remarks during his time at school , with the party leader admitting he did ' push the boundaries of debate ' further than he should			1
and now a pixel fault on the @entity3 big screen in @entity18 , @entity19 , saw the @entity5 leader sporting a somewhat unfortunate accessory when appearing on @entity22 this morning			1
not a good luck : the timing of the glitch which appeared on @entity22 could n't have been worse for @entity4 unfortunate comparison : the @entity3 glitch left @entity4 sporting something similar to @entity9 @entity28 broadcast comments from teachers at @entity31 that the teenage @entity4 was a ‘ fascist ’ and a ‘ racist ’ when a pupil at the private @entity35 school in the late 1970s and early 1980s			1
a letter from 1981 claims mr @entity4 , now 49 , was even heard ‘ shouting @entity38 songs ’			2
the claims did not prevent him being appointed as a prefect at the school			0
the @entity5 leader last night played down the significance of the claims , which he said were made by left - wing teachers who disliked his views			1
he denied singing @entity47 songs			0
sadly this latest , unfortunate error comes just at the wrong time for the embattled @entity4			0
and today marked a new low for @entity4 on a personal level when he was forced to call for the sacking of friend and fellow party member @entity55			1
drink it all away : a beer is only a short - term solution to mounting problems facing @entity5 leader @entity4 ( pictured left ) the @entity63 , speaking at an event held to promote women , was heard to say ' this place is full of sluts , ' before calling one journalist ' a sad little man ' and hitting another with a brochure			1
it comes barely a month after mr @entity55 's complaint that @entity72 aid money was being sent to ‘ @entity73 ’			2
mr @entity55 was attending an event at the @entity5 conference designed to promote women in politics			2
he seemed an unlikely choice , having previously declared that he wanted to deal with women 's issues because : ' i just do n't think they clean behind the fridge enough			0
' several female speakers made reference to the remark at today ’s meeting , with one confessing : ‘ i too have never cleaned behind the fridge			0
’ mr @entity55 replied : ‘ this place is full of sluts			2
’ outburst : @entity5 mep @entity55 said an event to promote women in politics ' full of sluts ' before falling foul of @entity96 reporter @entity97 ( left ) clobber : mr @entity55 hit mr @entity97 over the head with the @entity5 brochure as they argued about the fact there were no white faces on the front cover @entity5 called an emergency meeting tonight to discuss whether to kick mr @entity55 out of the party			1
the leader does not have the power to withdraw the whip , but chairman mr @entity110 said the remarks had gone too far			0
and there are further stormy waters ahead for @entity4 , after another @entity63 said he believed rape has ' different levels of culpability ' @entity117 said he stood by his view that the victim ' shares a part of the responsibility ' in some date rape cases			1
mr @entity117 , who was appearing on @entity28 to respond to the @entity5 whip being withdrawn from his fellow mep @entity55 for calling females in the audience at a conference fringe event ' sluts ' , insisted ' we in this party respect women '			1
questioned about his views on rape , mr @entity117 said : ' i think what we are looking at is the situation where different crimes have different levels of culpability , that 's why we have judges , that 's why judges apply different sentences for different offences			1
mobbed : a media scrum formed around mr @entity55 as the row erupetd over his comments about women at a @entity5 event anger : the @entity5 leadership are furious that mr @entity55 's antics have distracted from the launch of its drive to win next year 's @entity155 elections ' we in this party respect women , i 'm sorry that we do n't live up , or that @entity55 did n't live up to that today			1
' asked if he stood by past comments on rape he said : ' yes i do			0
' mr @entity117 added : ' i said that there were different degrees of culpability and that is why we have judges who issue different sentences			2
you would expect a judge trying a murder case to apply the appropriate sentence in relation to the culpability of the person who is accused			0
' we are here today at a party conference where we have a whole range of issues and i 'm not interested in doing an interview with you over a lot of old ground from way back , i 'm much more interested in talking about policy			2
' foot in mouth : @entity5 's @entity117 's quotes on the levels of rape are sure to cause his leader more trouble in 2011 , while a @entity191 mep , mr @entity117 described a ' classic stranger rape ' scenario , where a ' masked individual emerges from the bushes , hits his victim over the head with a blunt instrument , drags her into the undergrowth and rapes her , and then leaves her unconscious , careless whether she lives or dies '			1
he contrasted that with a ' date rape ' , where a woman ' voluntarily goes to her boyfriend 's apartment , voluntarily goes into the bedroom , voluntarily undresses and gets into bed , perhaps anticipating sex , or naively expecting merely a cuddle			0
' but at the last minute she gets cold feet and says ' stop ! '			0
the young man , in the heat of the moment , is unable to restrain himself and carries on , ' he added			0
' in both cases an offence has been committed , and the perpetrators deserve to be convicted and punished			0
' but whereas in the first case , i 'd again be quite happy to hang the guy , i think that most right - thinking people would expect a much lighter sentence in the second case			0
rape is always wrong , but not always equally culpable			0
' mr @entity117 added : ' while in the first case , the blame is squarely on the perpetrator and does not attach to the victim , in the second case the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility , if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend 's mind			2
' mr @entity117 defected from the @entity234 to @entity5 in march 2012 , claiming @entity4 's party better reflected the views of conservative voters .			1

@entity4 was on @entity22 speaking about accusations that he made fascist remarks as a schoolboy
@entity5 leader sees party in fresh *turmoil* after @entity55 's *despicable* outburst
@entity55 said : ' this place is full of sluts ' at party conference
and now @entity5 mep @entity117 says he believes rape has ' different levels of culpability '
