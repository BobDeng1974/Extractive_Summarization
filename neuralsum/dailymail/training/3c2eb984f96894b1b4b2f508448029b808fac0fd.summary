@entity0 were prepared to use top goalscorer @entity1 as a makeweight in their attempts to land @entity5 in the summer			1
@entity1 has been a huge plus point during a largely mediocre season so far for @entity0 , scoring six goals			1
but the @entity9 international could easily have departed @entity11 earlier this year had things panned out differently			2
and the @entity0 boss tried to use @entity22 as bait to convince the @entity15 to part with their @entity25 international			1
at the time @entity1 was unsure of what his role would be under @entity13			1
speaking last month , he said : ' there were some interesting offers this summer , but i wanted to stay at @entity0			1
i wanted to fight for my place because i know i have a lot of beautiful things to show			0
@entity34 has been boosted by the fact @entity1 has been on form this season , top scoring for @entity0 ' i 'm a warrior			1
someone who wants to fight for his chance			0
in the beginning it was n't easy for me			0
i was one of the players @entity13 had n't invited for an individual meeting			2
so i did n't really know what to expect			0
' but i 've reacted by working hard during the week			0
i grabbed my chance during a [ @entity48 ] @entity47 game in @entity49 , where i came in 20 minutes before the end of the game			0
' the next game , against @entity53 , i scored twice and since then i 'd always play			2

@entity1 has scored six goals this season for @entity0
but he could have been different for the @entity59 midfielder
@entity13 was desperate to sign @entity5
@entity1 *admits* he is happy he stayed at the club , as he is a fighter
