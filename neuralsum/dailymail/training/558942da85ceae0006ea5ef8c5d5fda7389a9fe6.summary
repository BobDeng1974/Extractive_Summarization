by @entity0 last updated at 3:12 pm on 21st november 2011 a football referee who tried to commit suicide in his hotel room hours before a top - flight match owes his life to his three assistants , said the head of the @entity8			1
@entity9 , 41 , tried to take his own life ahead of the @entity12 game between @entity13 and @entity14 , which was called off 40 minutes before kick - off with fans already filling the @entity16			1
@entity9 , a former banker of @entity18 descent , was today released from hospital and his father said he had apologised to the family			1
stable condition : referee @entity9 ( left ) attempted to commit suicide on saturday just hours before he was due to take charge of a top flight match ' he said he loved me			1
i am very happy that he is ok , ' said @entity27			2
@entity9 was discovered in the bath of his @entity13 hotel room two hours before kick off on saturday			1
he was found by his assistants - @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 - who received no answer when they knocked on his door after he failed to show up for a meeting			1
dr @entity37 , president of the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , described the pressure on referees as ' immense ' and said that @entity9 was only alive thanks top the actions of his colleagues			1
' i have got to say that these three have saved his life , ' he said			2
' when they discovered him , they ensured that he could survive with quick emergency measures			2
postponed : the message informing fans at @entity13 's @entity16 that the match was called off ' they have explained everything to me and to the police			1
all i can say is compliments to them			2
' they took immediate measures and kept their cool			2
' it definitely took a lot to stabilise him and to contribute to him being able to remain alive			2
' it took less than 15 minutes for @entity9 's assistants to realise that something was amiss when the normally punctual referee failed to show up for a meeting in their hotel			1
attempts to call the @entity70 - based official proved futile while the referee did not respond when they knocked on his hotel door either			1
with the aid of a hotel worker , they gained access to @entity9 's room , where they were confronted with a horrific discovery in the bath tub			1
' they saved his life ' : @entity37 , president of the @entity85 football federation , paid tribute to @entity9 's team of officials ' naturally , all three of them are distraught , ' added dr @entity37			1
' they were sat with him the night before and did not notice anything amiss			0
' only at 1.30pm when he did not appear , did they start to worry and they reacted quickly			0
' it is certainly a burden for them when a close friend , with whom they have worked together for a long time and officiated over important games , takes such a step			0
more than 45,000 fans attended the funeral of @entity106 goalkeeper @entity105 , whose suicide stunned the world of football			0
@entity105 was 32 when he stepped in front of a train near his @entity70 home on november 10 , 2009			0
the highly - rated player had been suffering from depression for around six years but had not wanted the news to be public knowledge , his wife @entity113 said after his death			0
the player was afraid the couple 's adopted eight - month - old daughter would be taken away from them if his illness was known			0
in a country where football is so important , @entity105 's death prompted a debate about whether players receive sufficient psychological support , and struck a chord throughout the game			0
' i think it still has n't sunk in			0
i was pleased that they looked so composed , but i think that will change over the coming days			0
' the three officials were provided with psychological care and dr @entity37 has promised that the @entity85 will ' provide them with all of the help that the @entity8 can offer ' to come to terms with the experience			1
but he expects them to be strong , given the nature of their job			0
' you have got to be very tough to be able to cope with everything in this sport , ' he said			0
' of course refereeing has become a very difficult job and there are a lot of demands placed on referees nowadays			2
' it is not so easy to describe when you hear how people who play such an important role in top - level sport suddenly arrive in a situation where they feel there is no way out , which means they see no alternative in life			0
' that is quite terrible			0
' it is the second time in just over two years that @entity85 football has been rocked by suicide , following the death of the national team 's goalkeeper @entity105 on november 10 , 2009			1
when the announcement was made at the ground on saturday that the game was to be called off there were boos from fans , but @entity8 official dr @entity177 insists there was no other choice			1
' i am deeply shocked and i believe that everybody connected with the @entity12 feels the same way , ' he said			0
' something like this has never happened before and it has deeply shocked people			0
' if there was anything to be learned from the death of @entity105 , then it was that football is not everything in life , as @entity37 said at the time			0
' calling off this game was the right decision , there is no doubt about that			0
' although @entity9 was voted the worst referee three times in the last four years in a poll of @entity12 players conducted by @entity204 , he nevertheless earned his place on the @entity207 refereeing register in 2008			1
and given the reaction of two @entity12 coaches , he is a well - liked personality			0
' it is shocking , ' said @entity70 coach @entity212			0
' @entity9 is a good friend in our club and in our team so we are particularly interested in knowing how he is			1
' @entity217 coach @entity216 added : ' @entity9 is one of the referees i like the most and i hope that we see him again soon in the @entity12			1
' @entity9 has been a referee since 1997 and a @entity12 referee for six years , with his first ever match having also been between @entity13 and @entity14			1
he has officiated 84 top - flight @entity85 league games			2
he had been a @entity207 referee since 2008 , but was not nominated by the @entity8 to referee this year at international level .			2
