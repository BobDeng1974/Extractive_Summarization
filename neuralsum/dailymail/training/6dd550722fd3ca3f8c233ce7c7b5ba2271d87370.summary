by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 08:48 est , 29 november 2013 they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day and for this family sharing it with their pet camel is a no - brainer			1
@entity9 , a six - year - old @entity11 camel visits the @entity14 family 's home every morning , and enjoys munching his way through carrots and bananas on the breakfast table			1
while @entity20 , 34 and wife @entity19 , 31 , who live on a farm in @entity24 , @entity26 attempt to have a nice civilised breakfast with their two sons , @entity30 , 3 and @entity31 , 2 , the family barely have the chance to sit down before @entity9 pokes his head through the window and helps himself			1
@entity9 the 6 year old camel , with @entity20 , 34 , wife @entity19 , 31 , and sons @entity30 , 3 and @entity31 , 2 @entity9 , who stands at 5.83 feet is not particularly picky and will happily chow down on bread , cereal and fruit , but does turn his nose up at cheese			1
although @entity9 lives with three other female camels , he is the only one lucky enough to share breakfast with his owners			1
the others have to eat hay , barley , straw and corn mix in their stable			0
mr @entity14 , said : ' the first time @entity9 joined us for breakfast he was uninvited			1
' he leaned in and rudely helped himself to the fruit bowl			0
but i was n’t surprised because he ’s very good at persuading all the other animals to give him their food too			0
” ' now he comes over whenever he feels like it and hovers around in anticipation			0
@entity9 the camel enjoys his morning meal with the @entity14 family mr @entity14 admits that @entity9 is his favourite pet			1
the couple look after and train 74 other creatures which are used in tv , films and commercials ' he is eating us out of house and home , but we ca n’t get angry at him			1
he is like a big soft giant teddy bear and has become part of the family			2
' although the family have gotten used to @entity9 ’s freeloading , the family were initially frustrated at first with his lack of table manners			1
mr @entity14 said : ' despite his regular visits , @entity9 has n’t mastered a knife and fork yet			2
' he is a messy eater , and the mess he leaves takes ages to clean up			0
he has no table manners			0
' the couple run @entity89 , a business that supplies animals to big events , commercials , film and tv shows			0
@entity9 is their star worker and has appeared in camel races , commercials and events around the country			1
he has even starred in a desert scene for a famous hair brand			0
the cheeky camel invited himself to breakfast one morning , and now the family have made it a regular thing mr @entity14 admits @entity9 is his favourite and has even bought @entity9 his own lorry so he can be transported in style			1
but their relationship has n’t always been a good one			0
at first , when he brought @entity114 back from @entity115 as a calf , training him to follow commands was a tough job			0
it took 12 months to teach @entity9 how to follow instructions and mr @entity14 had to quickly learn to dive out of the way when a ball of spit was aiming for his face			2
he said : ' @entity9 needed to get used to having a head collar on him , we used food to train him and this worked well			2
the hardest part was to teach him how to cush ( kneel down )			0
' he spat at me most of the time showering we with camel dribble and regurgitated food			2
it was n’t the most pleasant of things , but i do n’t blame him for doing it			0
if camels are stressed or agitated then they will spit at you			0
' luckily for the family , @entity9 does n’t spit anymore and is the best behaved animal on the farm			2
