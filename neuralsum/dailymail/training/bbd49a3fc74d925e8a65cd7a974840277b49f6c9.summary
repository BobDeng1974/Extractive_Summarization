a @entity1 bakery owner who refused to make a cake with a slogan supporting gay marriage insists he will not back down , even if he is taken to court			1
@entity6 - based in @entity7 and named after a verse in the @entity9 - has been warned by the @entity10 that the law does not allow them to turn down an order to bake the cake			1
but general manager @entity15 said his company would not be baking the cake under any circumstances , insisting that @entity1 should be able to apply their beliefs to the day - to - day running of their businesses			1
@entity6 bakers , in @entity22 , who refused to bake a gay rights cake are to be taken to court by the state equality watchdog in the past the courts have said it is wrong for @entity1 to refuse to serve gay people on grounds of their sexuality			1
judges have also said it is right for @entity1 to be fired from their jobs for refusing to take part in same - sex civil partnership ceremonies or for saying they would not give sex therapy to same - sex couples			0
but the challenge to the @entity1 - run @entity6 is the first likely legal case in which anyone has been told it is against the law to refuse to take part in gay rights publicity campaigns			1
despite the threat of legal action , the business ' owner insists he will not go against his beliefs			2
mr @entity15 said : ' i would like the outcome of this to be that any @entity1 running a business could be allowed to follow their @entity1 beliefs and principles in the day - to - day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that			2
' the new clash between gay rights and @entity1 convictions began in may when an activist from the @entity65 pressure group approached the @entity22 bakery chain and ordered a cake decorated with the words ‘ support gay marriage ’			1
the design also included the organisation ’s name and two characters from @entity74			0
the order from the activist , @entity76 , was accepted by shop staff			1
however , the owners of the family - run company , @entity81 and @entity82 , and their son @entity83 , who is manager , decided the message on the cake was contrary to their beliefs			2
mrs @entity82 phoned mr @entity76 to tell him the firm would not bake the cake , and to offer a refund			2
the bakers have in the past refused to produce cakes showing sexual images or featuring bad language			0
the new clash between gay rights and @entity1 convictions began in may when an activist from the @entity65 pressure group approached the @entity22 bakery chain and ordered a cake decorated with the words ' support gay marriage ' mr @entity76 complained to the @entity10 ’s @entity7 branch , which warned the bakers that they now face a legal claim			1
a letter from the @entity10 said : ‘ we have advised mr @entity76 that you have acted unlawfully and contrary to @entity105 of the @entity106 ( @entity7 ) 2006 which prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods , facilities and services to a person seeking or obtaining to use those goods , facilities or services on the grounds of sexual orientation			0
’ it said county court proceedings would start within seven days of the letter			0
the threat follows attempts by public sector organisations to compel staff to accept gay rights policies			2
in one case , that of @entity127 , demoted by @entity125 for a message on his private @entity130 page calling same - sex marriage ‘ an equality too far ’ , the @entity125 was told by the @entity134 to back down and mr @entity127 ’s right to free speech was vindicated			1
however , mr @entity127 won only £ 100 compensation			0
the @entity106 , pushed through by @entity138 despite a rebellion by @entity141 members who thought they threatened free expression , have always been taken to mean that businesses may not refuse to serve gay customers			0
in this case , mr @entity76 was turned down not because of his sexual orientation but because of the provocative nature of the cake he wanted baked			2
the bakery is now to be backed in court by the @entity152 pressure group			1
@entity153 lent support to @entity155 and @entity156 , the @entity158 hoteliers who lost a legal battle after they refused a room to a gay couple on the grounds that they were not married			0
the @entity166 judge who made the final decision in the case , @entity169 , has now said she believes the judgement against the @entity171 was too harsh and that the law should allow @entity1 a ‘ conscience clause			0
’ mr @entity76 complained to the @entity10 's @entity7 branch , which warned the bakers that they now face a legal claim @entity152 chief @entity177 said : ‘ the government repeatedly failed to listen to members of the public , lawyers , constitutional experts , even its own mps when they called for safeguards to protect those who back traditional marriage , especially those who work in the public sector			1
‘ now this nonsense , more usually associated with the public sector , is being applied to the private sector			0
this means millions of ordinary people who do not agree with gay marriage face intimidation and the real threat of legal action from the forces of political correctness if they , out of conscience , decline to provide good or services to campaign groups they do not agree with or support			1
‘ it establishes a dangerous precedent about the power of the state over an individual , or business to force them to go against their deeply held beliefs			0
’ mr @entity177 added : ‘ the government must take urgent action to address this injustice by introducing legislation that would introduce reasonable accommodation to protect those who for religious or philosophical reasons believe that marriage is the lifelong union of one man to one woman			0

@entity65 pressure group approached @entity22 bakery chain and ordered a cake decorated with the words ‘ support gay marriage ’
the order from activist @entity76 was accepted by shop *employees*
@entity6 later decided message was against their beliefs
the bakers now face a legal claim after a formal complaint was *lodged*
but owner @entity15 says he will not back down and bake the cake
it is likely to be first legal case in which anyone has been told it is against the law to refuse to take part in gay rights publicity campaigns
