sci - fi fans have long dreamed of having a robotic assistant like @entity2 or @entity3 the housecleaning robot in the @entity5			1
and while some of the droid ’s functions may be a few years off , a new generation of helpful robots have arrived and can act as everything from personal assistants to camera operators			2
while they may be designed to do different jobs , a handful of the robots featured at the @entity17 conference in @entity18 have one thing in common – they are designed to follow their leader			1
it is able to carry 50lbs ( 23kg ) of shopping and follows at a comfortable distance from its owner a robot called @entity27 is designed to follow elderly and disabled people to carry heavy items , such as shopping , @entity35 ’s @entity34 reported			1
made by @entity39 , the robotic assistant looks friendly and features a netted basket			1
to make @entity27 follow , its owner will wear a small device and uses an app to set the distance between them and the following robot			2
the helpful droid will be able to tail its owners at speeds of up to 2.4mph ( 3.9kph ) and send them a text if it ca n’t keep up			1
sensors prevent it from falling down steps or bumping into obstacles			0
@entity27 will come in different sizes , be able to be folded up and weighs 20lbs ( 9kg ) , while it will be capable of carting around 50lbs ( 23kg )			0
it will go on sale in january from $ 1,400 ( £ 879 )			0
while some of @entity62 and @entity2 's functions may be a few years off , a new generation of helpful robots have arrived and can act as personal assistants to camera operators			2
the @entity67 droids are shown people may want a droid for more vain needs			2
the @entity71 ( pictured ) is designed to follow its owner and has onboard cameras to capture them from above , working like a robotic cameraman for golfers , there ’s a smart cart called @entity77 that follows behind them with golf clubs			1
all they have to do is to wear a module on their belt , which includes a remote control , so the cart doens ; t get too close to them when they are taking an important shot			0
people may want a machine for more vain needs			0
the @entity71 + drone is designed to follow its owner and has onboard cameras to capture them from above , working like a robotic cameraman			2
a similar model called @entity94 is billed as a ‘ pet ’ drone and will automatically follows its owner who will wear a small programmable remote			2
the drone could be fitted with a @entity100 camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports , tracking everything from skateboarders to @entity106 riders			0
following drones are also useful in industrial settings			1
@entity109 , a bot made by @entity111 , can work in groups to tend plants in nurseries , for example ( pictured ) @entity94 is billed as a ‘ pet ’ drone and automatically follows its owner who wears a small programmable remote			1
the drone can be fitted with a @entity100 camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports , tracking everything from skateboarders ( pictured ) to @entity106 riders the @entity94 has a flight time of up to 15 minutes , and can reach speeds of 40 mph			0
take - off and landing is completely autonomous , and the @entity94 has preset flight modes to track different sports - including surfing , motocross , wakeboarding and skateboarding			0
the firm say the key to the drone is the algorithm it uses to track people			0
' it took a year and countless caffeine - fuelled hours , that were spent hacking intelligent flight code algorithms , ' said @entity142 , ceo and founder of @entity145 , who came up with the $ 995 ( £ 625 ) drone which could be pre-ordered via @entity148			0
following drones are also useful in industrial settings			1
@entity109 , a bot made by @entity111 , can work in groups to tend plants in nurseries , for example			1
a real drive - thru : in a chinese reaturant , robot waiters follow tracks painted on the floor to carry food to tables from the kitchen , where they collect dishes prepared by a robotic chef that are placed on a conveyor belt ‘ strings ’ of bots follow patterns marked out on the floor , using a @entity170 ( @entity170 ) to work out humans to follow and obstacles to avoid			1
while the following system is more precise , @entity170 is expensive and the robots cost $ 30,000 ( £ 18,837 ) each			0
more simple following technology is already been used in everyday settings			0
for example , robotic waiters carry food to hungry diners by following lines painted on floors in restaurants in @entity186			1
there are even inexpensive toys that can follow lines marked on floors , using basic light sensors .			0

following robots were on show at the @entity17 conference in @entity18
they include drones that autonomously follow their owner and film them too
a robot called @entity203 follows behind its owner to carry heavy shopping
on sale next year , the robotic assistant could help elderly people
the droid will be able to tail its owners at speeds of up to 2.4mph ( 3.9kph ) and will send them a text if it ca n’t keep up
following drones are also useful in industrial settings . @entity109 , a bot made by @entity111 , can work in groups to tend plants in nurseries
other examples of following robots not at the show can be seen in @entity186
there , robots follow paths in themed restaurants to act as waiters
