by @entity1 reporter published : 01:42 est , 22 february 2014 @entity3 : 01:42 est , 22 february 2014 for most cost - conscious consumers , keeping a car running for as long as possible is a serious financial issue			2
automotive web site @entity8 - which aggregates used car listings - have put together a study on cars with the best longevity , based on the amount that had been listed online with 200,000 or more miles on the odometer			1
topping the list was the @entity18 with 4.2 percent , @entity16 reported			1
that represents about 4,000 pickups out of some 95,000 of that model for sale , according to @entity23 , co-founder and ceo of @entity25			2
to measure longevity , automotive web site @entity8 - which aggregates used car listings - analyzed data to see what specific vehicles for sale had the highest percentage of listings with 200,000 or more miles on the odometer results : the list of cars is based on the amount that are listed as for sale with over 200,000 miles topping the list was the @entity18 with 4.2 percent			1
that represents about 4,000 pickups out of some 95,000 of that model for sale interestingly , the top 10 rankings are all large pickups and @entity45 , with the @entity46 taking second place			2
' clearly some of these vehicles are used for work and they are driven more miles but also perhaps get better maintenance , ' @entity23 told @entity52			0
pickups are driven longer , with the average listing for all models showing 90,000 miles compared to 75,000 for the average car listing			2
among cars , @entity57 was at the top , with 1.6 percent of listings showing over 200,000 miles			1
but that percentage is relatively low , partly because there are so many accords on the market			0
of the 377,000 accords for sale , about 6,000 have over 200,000 miles			1
others among the top ten ( when trucks and suvs were excluded ) included , in order - @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity74 minivan , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
the @entity57 was the number one car , the study found while the top vehicles were suvs and trucks , the @entity71 also rated highly as a car while @entity18 and @entity88 topped the list of long - running trucks , the @entity77 is the only model on the car list from a @entity94 - based brand			1
increases in manufacturing quality in the last decade have contributed to more vehicles lasting for 200,000 miles or more			1
' car makers are making better vehicles , and that is a factor in the increasing longevity , ' said @entity23			0
that has resulted in a market even for well - used vehicles			0
for instance , a 2003 @entity106 with 228,000 miles has an asking price of $ 4,900			0
family size : the @entity74 has a good performance record a 2001 @entity57 sporting 250,000 miles is on sale for $ 3,000			1
those prices are 10 to 15 percent of list price for a well - equipped new 2014 version of the same model			0
experts say the easiest way to ensure your car runs as long as possible is to follow the prescribed maintenance schedule and use a good mechanic			0
ensuring that you got some highway driving in is also healthy for the car , with short stop - and - go trips hard on a car .			0
