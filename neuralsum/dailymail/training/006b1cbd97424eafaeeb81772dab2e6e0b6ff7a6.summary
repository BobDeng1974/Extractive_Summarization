by @entity0 published : 20:22 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 22:51 est , 8 december 2013 a business promising to bring ‘ snuggles ’ to the people of @entity3 , @entity4 , has shut less than a month after opening , citing ‘ harassment ’ from city officials who had publicly expressed concerns that it was really just a front for prostitution			1
the @entity12 , which offered hugging , cuddling and spooning with professional snugglers for $ 60 an hour , attracted nationwide attention back in october when it was initially due to open			1
in the end the business only opened on november 15 after weeks of delays because of inspections by city officials who were concerned that the second - floor business could be a front for prostitution			1
these professional snugglers are out of work after the @entity12 in @entity3 , @entity4 , shut after being open less than a month assistant city attorney @entity24 , said her first thought when she heard about the @entity12 was ‘ ok , this is going to be a place of prostitution			1
’ she said owner @entity28 initially had no business plan , no business insurance , no training protocols and no answers when she asked him what he would do if a snuggler was sexually assaulted			2
snugglers contend that touching helps relieve stress , but before it had even opened @entity3 police had talked openly about conducting a sting operation and city attorneys were drafting a new ordinance to regulate snuggling			1
' there 's no way that ( sexual assault ) will not happen , ' said @entity24			0
' no offense to men , but i do n't know any man who wants to just snuggle			0
' @entity12 owner @entity28 was accused by local officials of having no business plan , no business insurance , no training protocols and no answers when asked him what he would do if a snuggler was sexually assaulted on friday the business posted a message on its @entity62 page that it had closed for good			1
‘ the @entity12 is officially closed - for good			0
for those people who supported us , thank you			0
snuggle on ! ’ the post read			2
no specific reason was given , but on @entity62 the @entity12 posted : ' the push back and harassment is not worth it , honestly			1
' the closing announcement drew scores of comments on the @entity12 ’s @entity62 page , most of them sympathetic			1
some said they were sad to see the business close so soon ; a few said they had been hoping to try the service			2
alderman @entity79 , who represents the area , said he received quite a few concerned questions from locals residents and businesspeople before the business opened , but no complaints since then			2
the @entity12 had opened in downtown @entity3 , @entity4 , last month , but announced on friday that it has closed for good			0
he said he was surprised to hear that the @entity12 had closed so soon and so abruptly			0
' my guess would probably be that they just did n’t have the business that they anticipated , ' he told the @entity91			2
the @entity62 page for the business offers the @entity12 ’s furniture to local church organizations ' for people who are in need , ' and promises refunds for unused gift certificates			1
this type of business has been successful in the likes of @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104			2
but @entity4 's ultra-liberal capital city seemed to have deeper concerns than others where similar businesses have set up shop as cuddling has grown into a cottage industry over the past decade			1
the concept was that clients would be able to book in for an hour of hugs and cuddles for $ 60 the @entity12 claimed it was a legitimate business and its advertising materials included a disclaimer warning that there would be no nudity or sex police in @entity123 , @entity102 , said they 've had no complaints about @entity125 , which offers overnight cuddle sessions			1
be the love you are in @entity129 , @entity130 , offers cuddles with ‘ @entity132			0
’ cuddle therapy in @entity134 offers packages that ‘ focus directly with your current needs around connection , intimacy and touch , ’ according to its website			0
the nonprofit organization @entity141 has trained about 100 people across five continents to run group snuggle sessions , said @entity146 , a psychologist who serves as executive director at @entity141 headquarters in @entity149 , @entity150 @entity151 , a @entity152 - based sex educator who facilities cuddle parties in that city , said she 's never had problems with government officials or police			0
@entity141 participants must keep their clothes on and go through a pre-session workshop on how to say ‘ no , ’ she said			0
‘ people think if there 's touch happening there must be sex happening			0
that 's not the case at all , ’ @entity162 said .			0
