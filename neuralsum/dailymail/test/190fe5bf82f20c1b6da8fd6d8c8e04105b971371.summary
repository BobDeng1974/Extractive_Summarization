homesick @entity0 insists it is not a foregone conclusion that he will return to @entity3 when he cuts short his @entity4 stay at the end of the season			1
the 26 - year - old @entity8 full - back is interesting his former club , where his brother @entity10 plays , and @entity3 have an option to bring him back to the @entity12			2
when announcing his departure barely 18 months ago , @entity3 announced they could re-sign @entity0 on a ' defined salary ' on his return to @entity16			1
@entity0 has been released by the @entity4 after feeling homesick and while @entity0 says it would ' be nice ' to resume his @entity3 career , he is tentatively exploring alternative options too			1
asked where he would be playing next , @entity0 said : ' i 've not worked that out just yet			2
the first thing was to sort it out over here that i could go back			0
' hopefully that 'll be sorted in the not - too - distant future			0
' @entity3 is where @entity0 launched his career , playing for the club from 2008 to 2013 , so it is inevitable he should be linked with last season 's @entity32 runners - up			1
' that 's where my brother 's playing and that 's where i 'm from , but i 'm open to other places			0
i 'm just trying to work out what will be the best option for me , ' he said			0
' @entity3 would be nice but i know it 's not the only team i can go to			2
' before the announcement on wednesday morning that @entity0 will be on the move , @entity3 chairman @entity46 told @entity49 : ' if he became available we would be very interested			1
' we 've got the first option			0
if it gets to the point where he is available it is in our hands			0
and i 'll be delighted if that was the case			0
' @entity0 has been open with his current club about the reasons for wanting to leave			0
rather than not settling into the @entity59 game , it is being apart from his family and friends that has been niggling away at @entity0 , unsettling him and leaving him longing for life back in the north of @entity8			1
he told @entity66 : ' i 've enjoyed every minute of being amongst that group but @entity59 is pretty far from @entity3 , where all my family live , so i want to be back in @entity8 around my family			1
@entity0 celebrates winning the @entity70 with @entity3 in 2013 having spent five years with club ' i 'll be two years i 've been away and to be able to go back and be around family and friends is what i 'd rather be doing next year			1
' a replacement for @entity0 has already been found by @entity4 , with @entity59 international @entity76 agreeing a three - year contract that will take effect from next season			1
@entity80 will join from @entity81 , with @entity4 head coach @entity82 describing the 21 - year - old on wednesday as ' a wonderful talent and a fantastic signing '			2
that has cleared the way for @entity0 , currently sidelined with a minor knee injury , to depart without causing excessive disruption 12 months before the end of his three - year contract			2
@entity0 joined the @entity4 for a world record transfer fee - thought to be in the region of Â£ 700,000			1
' they invested a lot into me to get me over here which i appreciate , ' he said			0
' they handled that brilliantly when i was coming and again equally so when i 've asked if i can leave			0
' it was tough because i feel like i owe them something and hope i can pay them back with another big year this year			0
' @entity4 managing director @entity104 said of @entity0 : ' he came here excited about testing himself in the @entity105 and also experiencing living in a new country but , in the end , @entity0 has found it too much of a challenge being away from home			1
' it 's disappointing that it has come to this but reluctantly we have accepted there is no option but to allow @entity0 to return to @entity8			0
