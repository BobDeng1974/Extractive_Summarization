over 250 cans of food and essential items bought in the 1970s have been found in near - perfect condition in a mysterious cupboard that had n’t been opened in 40 years			1
the extraordinary find was made by the caretaker of a tower block in @entity8 , @entity9 - and because there was no key , he had to use an angle grinder to gain entry			1
once @entity14 , 64 , had opened the door on the 11th floor he was transported back in time			1
time warp : items discovered in the cupboard are post-decimal 1971 but still have half pence on their prices , which were abolished in 1984 to @entity21 go : bold detergent ( above ) was launched in 1974 and this packaging was on the shelves until 2004 , when it was given a major revamp			2
the design of the @entity29 soup on the right has barely changed since the 1980s , but was very different in 1910 , when it was first brought to the @entity31			0
@entity33 's sugar crystals ( far right ) are no longer available but the firm still makes a tasty range of coffee			2
the @entity38 's @entity37 ( far left ) , meanwhile , has a notable one and a half pence off inside he found tins of @entity29 lentil and chicken and mushroom soup , mackerel in tomato sauce , @entity47 scotch broth soup and washing - up liquid			1
packs of @entity51 ’s baby powder , brown sugar crystals and cling film were also hidden inside the well organised cupboard			0
items discovered in the cupboard are post decimal 1971 but still have half pence on their prices , which were abolished in 1984			2
@entity57 knows how it got here : @entity59 has been making rice pudding since just before the outbreak of the @entity62 and a tin of it was found in the corner of the mysterious cupboard in @entity8			1
these days the product comes in a pot with a lid			0
on the right is another family favourite - @entity70			2
they still make their famous @entity73 , but not the @entity74 filling pictured mr @entity14 also stumbled across baked beans , jars of coffee , unused pots and pans , a variety of cleaning products and powdered milk			1
the items still had price labels on them including from shops such as @entity87 , @entity47 and some were simply tagged ‘ international ’			0
the cupboard is next to an access point and mr @entity14 only made the discovery because he asked why no one had opened it			1
no one in at the flats knows why the items would have been stored in such an unusual place or who may have put them there			0
remarkable find : mr @entity14 ( left ) said the discovery he made at the tower block in @entity8 ( right ) was ' a little treasure trove of history ' and he 's reluctant to dispose of it mr @entity14 said : ‘ it was pure curiosity			1
i thought it was just going to be full of rubbish so when i popped it open i got quite a shock			2
‘ no one can throw any light on where it all came from			0
‘ there were hundreds of old cans and goods , there was probably at least 250 items stored in the cupboard			0
‘ someone had obviously spent a lot of money and were stocking up for some reason			0
‘ apart from an exploded tin of prunes , it was in perfect condition			0
’ mr @entity14 continued : ‘ the seventies was a very uncertain time , with the miner ’s strikes , the three day week and the @entity133 - so maybe someone was preparing for the apocalypse			1
‘ i am reluctant to dispose of it as it is a little treasure trove of history - whoever stocked it up must have spent a fortune			0
