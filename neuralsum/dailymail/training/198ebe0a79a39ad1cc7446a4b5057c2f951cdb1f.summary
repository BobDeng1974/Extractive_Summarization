the @entity2 has no plans to restrict travel from @entity6 countries hard - hit by the ebola virus epidemic , the @entity1 administration said monday			1
at the same time , the president 's chief spokesman said the @entity2 wo n't absolutely rule it out			1
' a travel ban is not something that we 're currently considering , ' @entity12 press secretary @entity11 told reporters			2
' we feel good about the measures that are already in place , ' he insisted			0
@entity12 on tilt ? @entity1 's aides are facing tough questions from reporters who demand to know why planes from @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 are still allowed to land at @entity2 airports amid an @entity29 now arriving in the @entity2 : 77 sick patients believed to be infected with @entity31 have been stopped from boarding planes bound for @entity2 , and the @entity12 says that 's enough to suggest the planes can still come global village : @entity6 nationals can connect to the @entity2 via @entity37 or @entity38 and the @entity12 says the planes have to continue flying if supplies and aid workers are to reach those in need ' our experts continue to be confident that the medical infrastructure that we have in this country is sufficient to prevent an @entity31 outbreak from occurring , ' @entity11 said			1
he continued monday to project confidence , which some have interpreted as reassuring while others see it as complacency			0
still , he adopted a never - say - never attitude when pressed on the subject			0
' this is something that we regularly assess and re-assess , and – so i would n't rule out any changes in the future , ' he said			1
@entity11 explained that a back - and - forth flow of aviation traffic is needed in order to fight the @entity31 outbreak from an ocean away			1
' we 're relying on the commercial transportation system to move supplies and personnel into the region , ' he said			2
' so we do n't want to obstruct one of the core components of our strategy			0
' the administration is relying heavily on what @entity11 called ' a multi-layered screening protocol ' to spare @entity2 from the kind of public health devastation that has brought three countries to their knees and killed thousands			1
' there are extensive screening measures on the ground in west africa where this outbreak has occurred , ' he said , adding that ' there 's guidelines and guidance and training that has been given to flight crews			1
' ' there also is a protocol in place for @entity94 and @entity95 officers who are manning our ports of entry , ' @entity11 added , ' to be on the lookout for individuals , again , that may be exhibiting symptoms of @entity31 – in other words , that are contagious with @entity31			2
' but health officials said sunday that they are considering the approval of new measures designed to provide the @entity2 with one extra firewall , such as checking the body temperature of everyone who enters the @entity2 from an affected nation			2
death toll keeps tolling : @entity114 workers loaded the body of this @entity31 victim onto a truck for disposal on sunday setting boundaries : @entity2 @entity121 personnel mark out the location of a future field hospital in @entity24 with razor wire , which could be needed to keep hordes of patients out of the few clinics available other pandemics have seen similar strategies			1
in 2009 , at the height of the avian influenza scare , @entity130 and other @entity132 nations required temperature checks of every passenger deplaning in @entity137 and other major points of entry			0
but those modest steps , like the more drastic travel ban proposals , are just drawing - board ideas			0
@entity144 director dr. @entity143 said sunday that a ' discussion is underway right now ' and ' all options are being looked at ' for new @entity2 - based screening plans			1
but the question , he told @entity149 , is whether ' the extra level of screening is going to be worth the resources you need to put into it			0
at a press conference sunday , @entity157 chief dr. @entity156 declared : ' there 's no doubt that we can stop @entity31 in this country			0
' he also said current screening protocols in @entity165 have stopped 77 potentially @entity31 - infected people from boarding planes to @entity2			1
the ebola virus is transmitted via contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person			0
the current strain of the virus is believed to have killed about half of the people it has infected in @entity165			2
@entity2 officials stressed friday during a @entity12 press conference that @entity2 's public health system is more robust and will adequately protect the public .			0

77 people have been prevented from boarding @entity2 - bound planes in west @entity165 , but the @entity157 does n't know what it does n't know
@entity1 spokesman @entity11 said there is no plan to cut off travel from @entity24 and other ebola *hotspots* but ' i would n't rule out any changes '
@entity11 said a back - and - forth flow of aviation traffic is needed in order to get personnel and supplies to the affected countries
the administration has ' a lot of confidence ' in current screening measures
