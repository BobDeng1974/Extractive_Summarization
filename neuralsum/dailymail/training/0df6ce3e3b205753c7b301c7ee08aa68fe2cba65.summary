[ headerlinks ] @entity0 of @entity1 , in a solo show of opportunistic racing , won the 12th stage of the @entity5 in a sprint as @entity7 kept the yellow jersey for a 10th day on thursday			1
after hitching a ride behind the back wheel of @entity12 sprinter @entity11 , @entity0 powered out of the barreling pack and beat @entity14 of @entity15 , who was second , by nearly a bike length , while @entity17 of @entity18 was third			1
the pack overtook a pair of breakaway riders with less than seven kilometers to go			0
@entity0 , who won the @entity23 race this year , pointed his fingers skyward and shouted as he crossed the line - pretty much without any of his @entity27 teammates : @entity14 's @entity29 team and @entity30 took turns leading the pack at the end			1
but @entity0 timed his burst perfectly			2
sprint finish : @entity27 procycling team rider @entity0 his win in the 12th stage of the @entity5 close call : @entity0 celebrates after crossing the finish line to win the 12th stage in @entity41 top of the charts : @entity12 @entity7 of @entity43 kept his grasp of the yellow jersey @entity46 sulking on @entity47 ' i won , finally , and i am really happy , ' @entity0 said of his first tour stage win , adding he had been second in two previous sprints			1
' it was time to win			0
' in @entity1 , there was a lot of pressure on me : i am the only @entity1 this year ! ' @entity0 paced himself without two big rivals : giant - @entity30 rider @entity56 , who has won three stages , was dropped earlier in the ride along four small - and medium - sized climbs , while @entity61 countryman @entity60 , who won stage 6 , crashed within the last few kilometers			1
' i went at just the right time , ' said @entity0 , adding he had no idea the two @entity61 were out of contention for the stage win			2
' i was just thinking about myself			0
' the mostly flat 185.5 - kilometer ( 115.5 - mile ) course from @entity68 to @entity41 in southeastern @entity18 was well suited for a possible sprint finish			0
hands up : @entity0 crosses the finish line ahead of @entity18 's @entity17 to win the twelfth stage over the bridge : the pack push through the 185.5km stretch from @entity68 to @entity41 the top standings did n't change			1
@entity7 leads @entity76 of @entity77 by 2 minutes , 23 seconds , and @entity78 of @entity79 was third , 2:47 back			2
@entity7 is looking to become the first @entity12 to win the tour since the late @entity81 in 1998			2
@entity83 rider @entity82 pulled out before the stage due to severe back pain from previous crashes			0
the @entity88 leader who won the @entity89 last month rode for several hours with excruciating back pain on wednesday , when he finished last on the 11th stage			0
the pack now faces two days in the @entity93 - which are getting relatively short shrift this year - even if both stages feature uphill finishes that are likely to shake up the top standings			1
friday 's relatively long @entity98 will also put riders ' legs under the most strain so far			0
the 197.5 - kilometer ( 123 - mile ) trek begins in @entity41 and will crescendo : it first covers a mid-sized climb , then the category 1 @entity106 pass , and finally an 18 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) ascent to the @entity109 of @entity110 - one of cycling 's hardest climbs			0
@entity7 , however , said his @entity43 team will try to manage the race on friday , before what he sees as a greater challenge a day later			2
' it 's surely the second stage in the @entity93 that scares me the most , ' he said , ' because on the first one everyone has energy , and it 's always the second one that requires more energy - and where you pay for your efforts			0
' scenic : the peloton passes through beaujolais vineyards in @entity129 , @entity18 leader : @entity7 wearing the yellow jersey , rides with his @entity133 's @entity43 teammates			1

@entity1 rider @entity0 held off challenge from @entity14
no change at top of overall standings as @entity7 *retains* yellow jersey
