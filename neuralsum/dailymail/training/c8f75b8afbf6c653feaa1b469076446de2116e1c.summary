by @entity0 published : 12:33 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:45 est , 6 december 2013 arm bone fragments from a 1.34 - million - year - old hominin , @entity4 , were discovered by an international research team a human ancestor that was characterised by a ' robust ' jaw and skull bones was also a muscular creature that had a gorilla - like upper body			1
bones have revealed that one of our ancient ancestor was more adaptive to its environment than previously thought			2
researchers found the partial skeleton -- including arm , hand , leg and foot fragments -- dating back 1.34 million years at at the @entity25 fossil site in @entity26			1
the skeleton belonged to a paranthropus boisei hominid which lived across @entity29 side - by - side with direct ancestors of humans			1
researchers believe the creature stood 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall , was very strong and had a robust frame			1
the find , published in @entity37 , represents one of the most recent occurrences of @entity4 before its extinction in @entity29			1
' this is the first time we 've found bones that suggest that this creature was more ruggedly built - combining terrestrial bipedal locomotion and some arboreal behaviours - than we 'd previously thought , ' said @entity46 , associate professor of anthropology at the @entity48			1
' it seems to have more well - formed forearm muscles that were used for climbing , fine - manipulation and all sorts of behaviour			0
' @entity4 was a long - lived species of archaic hominin that first evolved in @entity29 about 2.3 million years ago the skeleton belonged to a paranthropus boisei hominid which lived across @entity29 side - by - side with direct ancestors of humans			1
@entity4 was a long - lived species of archaic hominin that first evolved in @entity29 about 2.3 million years ago			1
the species was part of a line of close human relatives known as australopithecines that includes the famous three million - year - old @entity68 fossil @entity69 , seen by some as the matriarch of modern humans			2
roughly 2.3 million years ago , the australopithecines are thought to have split into the genus @entity75 - which produced modern @entity76 - and the genus @entity77 , that dead - ended			1
researchers believe the creature stood 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall , was very strong and had a robust frame			1
the size of the arm bones suggests strong forearms and a powerful upper body			2
' we know that it was very strong , ' professor @entity46 said			0
' it 's unprecedented to find how strong this individual was			0
the stronger you are the more adaptive you are			0
' @entity91 discovered the first skull of @entity4 in 1959 in northern @entity26			2
while @entity4 was known for its massive jaws and cranium , the build of the rest of the ancient hominin 's body has been unknown until recently			2
during excavations at @entity101 in 2010 - 2011 , the team discovered the partial skeleton of a large adult individual who is represented by various teeth and skeletal parts			0

earlier analysis of the species teeth had given researchers clues about the kind of food it ate			0
they believe it was omnivorous , leaning more toward plant material roughly 2.3 million years ago , the australopithecines are thought to have split into the genus @entity75 - which produced modern @entity76 - and the genus @entity77 , that dead - ended			1
in the absence of evidence of other skeletal remains , it was commonly assumed that the skeleton of @entity4 was like that of more ancient species of the genus @entity137			2
' we are starting to understand the physiology of these individuals of this particular species and how it actually adapted to the kind of habitat it lived in , ' professor @entity46 said			0
' we knew about the kind of food it ate -- it was omnivorous , leaning more toward plant material -- but now we know more : how it walked around and now we know it was a tree climber			0
' researchers found the partial skeleton dating back 1.34 million years at at the @entity25 fossil site in @entity26 the size of the arm bones suggests strong forearms and a powerful upper body			1
' it 's a different branch on our ancestry tree , ' professor @entity46 said			0
' it came later than the other hominins , so the question now is " what happened to it ? " we 're going to do more work on biomechanics and see what else this creature was doing			0
' in summer 2014 , the bones will be displayed as part of a large exhibit on human origins in @entity173 , @entity26			0
the joint - museum exhibit involves the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity177 , the @entity178 in @entity179 , and the @entity180 of @entity173			0
with each find scientists are adding to the understanding of how humans evolved and adapted to their surroundings through time			2
' the more we are finding of these fossils , the more we are learning about the history of these species , ' said professor @entity46 .			0

discovery was made by analysing bones of a @entity4 hominid
paranthropus boisei first evolved in @entity29 about 2.3 million years ago
the creature stood 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall and had a strong , robust frame
this is first time bones have suggested creature was more ruggedly built
