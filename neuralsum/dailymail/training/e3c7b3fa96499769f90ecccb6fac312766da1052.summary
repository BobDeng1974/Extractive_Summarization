one study revealed how the type of sugar used in such drinks apparently raises blood salt levels			1
a second showed that the drinks may cause the kidneys to get rid of too much protein from the body			1
a hallmark of failing kidneys is called proteinuria – the increased excretion of protein in the urine			2
it was found in those who had two of the drinks daily in a study at @entity30 in @entity31			1
more than 8000 university employees with regular kidneys took part in the experiment			0
a third abstained from fizzy drinks , another third drank one a day , and the final group had two a day			0
in a space of just three days , 10.7 per cent of the third group developed proteinuria , and 8.9 per cent of the second group showed similar effects			0
the first group just showed signs in 8.4 per cent of those tested			0
fructose or fruit sugar is used to sweeten soft drinks and researchers for the second study at @entity52 in @entity53 found that it increases the kidneys ’ sensitivity to @entity56 , a protein that regulates salt balance			1
it means salt is reabsorbed into the kidneys , which could lead to diabetes , obesity , kidney failure , or hypertension			0
fructose : sugary drinks contain fructose , which the study found forces our kidneys to reabsorb salt researchers hailed the tests , on rats , as a potential indication of what is causing epidemics of these illnesses			1
both studies were presented at the @entity81 in @entity82 last week .			0

@entity30 in @entity31 found drinks raise salt levels
they also push protein from body , @entity52 found
