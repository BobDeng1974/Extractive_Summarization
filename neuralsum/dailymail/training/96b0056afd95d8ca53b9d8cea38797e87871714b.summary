prehistoric cave paintings , canyon art and structures such as @entity4 may have been inspired by ' spooky sounds ' , a scientist has claimed			1
dr @entity6 thinks that sound waves reflecting off a cliff face or cave wall produced echoes that may have been interpreted by our ancestors as voices calling within the rock			1
he used acoustic measurements so show the link between prehistoric rock sites and strong echoes			1
spirited painting ? prehistoric cave paintings , canyon art and structures such as @entity4 may have been inspired by spooky sounds , a scientist has claimed			1
a prehistoric cave painting in @entity24 is pictured dr @entity6 , who is based in @entity26 , @entity27 , has studied acoustic archaeology around the world and says that echoes of clapping could sound similar to hoof beats or a herd of stampeding animals			1
‘ many ancient cultures attributed thunder in the sky to “ hoofed thunder gods , ” so it makes sense that the reverberation within the caves was interpreted as thunder and inspired paintings of those same hoofed thunder gods on cave walls , ’ he said			1
‘ this theory is supported by acoustic measurements , which show statistically significant correspondence between the rock art sites and locations with the strongest sound reflection			1
’ rock music : dr @entity6 said that @entity4 ( pictured ) may be linked to the haunting effects of sound interference patterns			1
he believes this may have influenced the positioning of the @entity4 rock slabs dr @entity6 thinks that sound waves reflecting off a cliff face or cave wall produced echoes which could have been interpreted as voices calling within the rock , by our ancestors			1
these noises may have inspired them to paint and lay out stones in a certain way			0
he says that echoes of clapping could sound similar to hoof beats or a herd of stampeding animals			2
because some ancient cultures attributed thunder to ' hoofed gods ' he thinks the reverberation within caves was interpreted as these gods and inspired ancient man to paint images of hooved animals on the walls			1
dr @entity6 thinks that @entity4 and other megalithic sites may be linked to the haunting effects of sound interference patterns			1
speaking at the @entity89 's annual meeting in @entity90 , dr @entity6 said that @entity4 and other megalithic sites may be linked to the haunting effects of sound interference patterns			1
he believes this may have influenced the positioning of the @entity4 rock slabs			1
to test his theory , he played the same droning note on two flutes in an open field			0
‘ the quiet regions of destructive sound wave cancellation , in which the high pressure from one flute cancelled the low pressure from the other flute , gave blindfolded subjects the illusion of a giant ring of rocks or “ pillars ” casting acoustic shadows , ’ he said			2
‘ my theory that musical interference patterns served as blueprints for megalithic stone circles - many of which are called @entity116 - is supported by ancient legends of two magic pipers who enticed maidens to dance in a circle and turned them all into stones			1
’ he explained that even today , sounds can be used to manipulate a person ’s perception of the world around them and lead to illusions inconsistent with scientific reality			0
dr @entity6 thinks this phenomenon has interesting practical applications for virtual reality and special effects in entertainment media			1
‘ sound , which is invisible and has complex properties , can easily lead to auditory illusions of the supernatural , ’ he said			0
‘ this , in turn , leads to the more general question : what other illusions are we living under due to other phenomena that we are currently misinterpreting ? ’ dr @entity6 has studied acoustic archaeology around the world and says that echoes of clapping could sound similar to hoof beats or a herd of stampeding animals			1
a painting of bull - like creatures in @entity155 , @entity152 is pictured			0
the cave contains some of the best - known @entity157 , painted 17,300 years ago the stones at @entity4 could have been ‘ played ’ like a giant xylophone , a study claimed in march			2
researchers spent months tapping pieces of stone onto 1,000 types of rock and recording the sound they made			2
most produced a muted ‘ thud ’ , but bluestones from the @entity170 hills in south @entity171 – where the monoliths are thought to have originated – ‘ sing ’ when struck			0
their ‘ exceptional sonic nature ’ may explain why @entity174 man carted the stones 200 miles to @entity176 in @entity177 more than 4,000 years ago to build @entity4			2
it may also shed light on their circle formation , with sound resonating among the stones when they were ‘ played ’			0
rock music : the stones at @entity4 could have been ‘ played ’ like a giant xylophone , a study claimed in march			2
researchers spent months tapping pieces of stone onto 1,000 types of rock and recording the sound they made the startling conclusion was the result of a study by experts at the @entity197 rather than by archaeologists			2
they were even granted access to @entity4 itself to play the structures like a giant xylophone , where they confirmed the rocks made a range of metallic sounds like bells , gongs and tin drums			2
@entity210 , who led the study with @entity211 , said : the one thing that has n’t been considered until now is that sound may have been an important factor			0
' we found it was a noteworthy soundscape , with a significant percentage of the actual rocks making metallic sounds like bells , gongs , tin drums , etc , when tapped with small , handheld " hammerstones "			0
' we have had percussionists up here who have been able to actually get proper tunes out of the rocks			0
this is real rock music			0
' the research team tested rocks from 1,000 different locations from around the @entity232 to test their sonic abilities			0
they found that bluestones from the @entity170 hills in @entity237 , sounded like no other			0
@entity239 allowed the team to acoustically test the bluestones at @entity4 , effectively playing them like a huge instrument			0
to the researchers ’ surprise , several were found to make distinctive , if muted sounds , with several of the rocks showing evidence of having already been struck			0
the stones make different pitched noises in different places and different stones make different noises - ranging from a metallic to a wooden sound .			0

dr @entity6 thinks that sound waves bouncing off cave walls produced echoes which could have been interpreted as voices by our ancestors
he thinks reverberation was also interpreted as thunder and inspired paintings of ' hooved thunder gods ' such as ancient animals
acoustic measurements at rock art sites show a link to strong echoes
dr @entity6 believes that @entity4 in @entity177 and other megalithic sites may be linked to the haunting effects of sound interference patterns
