@entity0 will not jeopardise his chances of winning the @entity3 @entity2 by repeating the erratic driving style he deployed at the last race in @entity7			1
@entity0 , who will again start on pole position here in @entity10 , slowed down and weaved during the parade lap three weeks ago , causing the cars behind him to slam on their brakes and in some cases to stop altogether			1
the @entity15 has learnt that race officials discussed @entity0 's strange behaviour at the time but decided not to penalise him			1
as long as he keeps his nose clean , @entity0 is likely to win sunday 's race after a brilliant performance in qualifying			1
he finished 0.168sec ahead of his @entity35 team - mate @entity34 to claim his fourth pole position in five races this season			2
for all the talk of upgrades to the cars of rivals at the opportunity offered by the first race of the @entity46 stage of the season , @entity35 have seemingly maintained their significant advantage over the rest			2
on track : @entity35 driver @entity0 is bidding for his fourth straight victory this season nobody can live with them : @entity53 , of @entity54 , was third fastest , a full second back from @entity56			1
' i 'm very disappointed , ' said @entity34			0
' i do n't particularly like coming second to @entity0			1
i did a good lap but he did a better job			2
' there is a danger , implicit in what @entity34 said , that @entity0 can waltz to his second world title			1
he has won three of the four races , the only blip being a technical malfunction at the opening round in @entity69			0
@entity34 won that race and was runner - up at the next three , meaning that he takes a four - point lead into sunday 's race in @entity10			1
@entity0 has not led the standings since he did so fleetingly in 2012			1
second best : @entity34 will start alongside his team - mate on the front row in sunday 's @entity3 @entity2 ' that was my one small taste of leading the championship for some time , but otherwise i do n't remember the last time , ' he said			1
' as long as you 're leading when you cross the finish line at the last race , that 's what counts			1
but it 's my goal to get in front and stay there			2
' @entity0 accomplished his pole position feat despite having problems with his machinery			1
he came on the radio to say : ' i do n't know how but we 've made the car worse			2
' he later explained : ' in practice we had such a great car and often when things are that good you do n't want to change much			2
but we changed a few things over night in the hope of making things a little bit better – small things , like half a millimetre here and there			0
' but today they car was a real handful			0
' best of the rest : @entity53 will start in third ahead of @entity110 who broke down on track the same could be said of the world champion , @entity110			0
the gearbox of his @entity54 failed , condemning him to start 10th and adding to a season of woe			0
how he must be irked by the performances of his team - mate @entity53			0
' i 'm quite disappointed , ' said @entity110			0
it was a dismal day , too , for @entity123			0
@entity124 was eighth fastest – impressive in the circumstances – and his rookie team - mate @entity126 15th			0
the feel - good factor that came with @entity130 's return is dissipating			0
it will take time for the structural changes that are slowly evolving to take full effect .			0
