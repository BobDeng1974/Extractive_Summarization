you ’ll come under a barrage of debris '			2
but local @entity44 mp @entity43 says he wants it banned			1
' this is completely dangerous and quite wrong			1
i would hope it is illegal and if it is n't i would like to know why not , ' he told @entity50			0
scene : one reveller here is dressed in full body armour before being beaten by police training : experts train them how to use weapons and also recreate scenarios like kettling ' not only are they showing people how to instigate a riot , they are showing them how to instigate a riot well			2
' he has already written to the chief constable of @entity66 about the issue			0
residents in his @entity70 constituency are also very upset			0
one wrote to mr @entity43 to say : ' this riot class is really worrying me			1
it is things like this that make me frightened to leave the house			0
' another said : ' is this really the best thing to teach young people - to go and torch things and loot shops			0
' promise : participants are told they will have an atmosphere of ' noise , fire , smoke and fear '			1
frightening : this image shows one man on the floor being attacked by men with batons @entity97 mp @entity96 , whose own constituency was caught up in the 2011 riots said : ' rioting is not a game			1
it is utterly irresponsible and insensitive not least because there are thousands of victims scarred to this day by the memories of what happened in that terrible august week of last year			1
' the activity 's webpage says thrill - seekers arrive and have a full briefing on modern riot control techniques			0
then they are trained to use batons and four foot riot shields , see a petrol bomb demonstration and learn the basics of casualty evacuation			1

tackling that argument a spokesman said : ' we are not inciting a riot , nor are we encouraging anybody to break the law			0
