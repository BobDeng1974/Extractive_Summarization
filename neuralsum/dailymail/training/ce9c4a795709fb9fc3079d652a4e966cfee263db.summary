they are the bane of ramblers and birds alike , but now homeowners are being warned that a nearby wind farm could cut the value of their houses by up to a third , an mp has claimed			2
@entity9 , conservative mp for @entity10 and @entity11 , said some homes in his area are now worth ' significantly less ' thanks to giant turbines , and that it is an ' injustice ' that homeowners should lose out while developers and land owners potentially pocket millions			1
mr @entity9 says proposals for scores of turbines have pushed rural areas to ' tipping point ' and has called for a new scheme to compensate those whose homes are affected			1
desperate times : @entity9 mp says proposals for scores of turbines have pushed parts of rural areas to tipping point planning minister @entity33 has proposed direct compensation for lost property value thanks to developments such as turbines , and also nuclear power stations , rail links and factories			1
the minister is eyeing a pilot scheme in the coming months , and it could be based on the @entity44 model that pays out an average of around £ 8,000 to householders that have suffered ' detriment '			2
mr @entity9 said he welcomed the proposal , which is likely to curry favour across rural @entity51 , @entity10 and @entity52 , where the growing number of wind farms are seen as a blight by residents			1
the mp said : ' an increasing number of people are coming to me with clear evidence that the value of their home is significantly less than what it otherwise would be were the wind farm not there			1
' he added : ' i ’m seeing a minimum 10 per cent to 15 per cent reduction			1
some are seeing a loss of one - third of the value ... how can that be fair ? ' ' how can it be right that landowners and developers are making millions of pounds , while the ordinary household is losing the value of what is their pension , or nest egg in old age			2
' wind farms are the source of much debate in rural communities , with a number of protest groups furious at the loss of local beauty spots			2
worse off : @entity9 said his constituents have been told by estate agents their homes are worth ' significantly less ' thanks to giant turbines in october , campaigners living near @entity96 in @entity97 , won a campaign to have four giant turbines dismantled - the first ever wind farm to be scrapped in the @entity101			1
residents and walkers were delighted by the return of unspoilt views across the rolling hills and deep blue waters of @entity108			0
and to their relief , the 150ft high turbines will not be replaced after the council refused permission for two even bigger machines			0
@entity114 , the chairwoman of the anti-wind farm campaign group @entity116 , says she has seen the value of a number of properties slashed thanks to the presence of a nearby turbine			0
she claims she has even heard of buyers withdrawing at the last minute after discovering plans for a wind farm in the local vicinity			2
ms @entity114 said : ' there is plenty of evidence that even the threat of a wind farm or a wind turbine can prevent the sale of houses '			0
she added : ' certainly after a wind farm has been erected properties within sight or sound of the turbines can become virtually unsaleable			0
of the planning minister 's proposal , mr @entity9 said : ' i would completely support households having to be paid compensation for the depreciation of their house value as a result of wind turbines			1
' ' it is simple nonsense for the pro-wind lobby to say they have no effect on house prices			0
' but he warned : ' the devil will be in the detail			0
how would you differentiate between those that are entitled and those that are not ? ' the compensation package was revealed quietly in december ’s autumn statement , but was detailed by mr @entity33 when her appeared before the @entity167 of @entity168			1
he said the proposal was a ' radical departure ' from @entity101 ’s current planning rules , but would help speed up major infrastructure that will boost growth , and would bring “ individual benefits ” for local residents from new development			2
his idea goes beyond existing schemes to compensate homeowners for roads and rail links which affect the property by creating noise and traffic			0
mr @entity33 said : ' i think that everybody recognises that countries have to do difficult things - build roads , build railway lines , build nuclear power stations and other kinds of power sources			1
' losing out : planning minister @entity33 has proposed direct compensation for lost property value thanks to developments such as turbines he added : ' it is better for everyone that the amount of money is banged up in the transaction process - making the decision , let alone building the thing , as little as possible and relatively speedy			1
with certain projects there has been a principle established of some kind of a benefit being paid to very local communities			0
' mr @entity33 went on : ' one of the things we are keen to pilot is whether people who have properties very close to a substantial development might benefit from some form of compensation for the loss of property value , something that does happen in some other countries , the @entity44 have innovated with it			1
' reacting to mr @entity9 's comments , @entity225 , managing director of local estate agent @entity226 , said : ‘ i ’ve not experienced this myself ... for every person who says i ’m not keen on having a wind farm nearby , another will say it ’s actually quite nice			2
' he added : ‘ i think so long as the thing is n’t on your actual doorstep and you can hear it buzzing , people just accept they are part of the landscape			0
whether or not they affect property value is specific to each individual home and not something that will affect the entire region			0
’ mr @entity225 went on : ‘ people are still far more concerned about other aspects of the sale			0
is it the right location ? is there access to the beach ? what are the schools like ? those are the things that really matter to people buying property around here ’ .			0
