click here for all the stats from @entity3 's win with our brilliant @entity5 service those intent on forcing @entity8 out of @entity3 will have to put their protests on ice			1
his tenure has come under intense scrutiny from disgruntled fans over the past few days ; the defeat at @entity17 on saturday raising major question marks			0
once more , though , he found answers - his side emphatically disposing of a poor @entity22 side			2
the match will forever be remembered for @entity25 's wonder goal			0
booked : @entity50 , @entity45 , @entity47 goal : @entity56 89			0
@entity3 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity37 6 ; @entity64 7 ( @entity65 77 , 6 ) , @entity66 7 , @entity67 6.5 , @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 6.5 ( @entity70 45 , 6.5 ) , @entity71 8 , @entity25 8.5 ( @entity72 45 , 6 ) ; @entity73 6.5 , @entity74 7.5 ; @entity75 6.5 subs not used : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80			1
booked : @entity69 , @entity74 , @entity64 goals : @entity74 3 , 90 , @entity82 & 29 @entity83 : @entity25 att : 20,950 referee : @entity85 6.5 player ratings by @entity87 at the @entity88 @entity8 may remember it for different reasons , however			1
when the chips were down , his players were n't			0
in reality , there was very little at stake for @entity8 's side , with their passage into the knockout stages already guaranteed			1
nevertheless , the manager will be glowing inside about how his side came through for him in @entity101			0
they had two ultra slim hopes of finishing above @entity104 at the top of @entity106 going into the encounter			0
the first was beating @entity22 and @entity108 recording a shock win over @entity111 's men			2
the other seemed beyond the realms of possibility ; @entity3 winning 6 - 0 and then a draw in @entity116 would have been suffice			1
@entity8 played the percentages , leaving 12 first - teamers at home , though most other were injured , so not to risk any further problems going in to the busy festive period			0
there were rare starts for @entity74 and @entity73 , while @entity64 made his first appearance in three months since recovering from an ankle injury			0
the @entity128 's team selection raised a few eyebrows , though			0
despite their minimal chances of finishing , another defeat would only serve to fuel the growing feeling amongst some fans that the manager must leave			0
any early apprehension faded inside three minutes , though , when @entity74 smashed them into an early lead			1
@entity25 , after an early season blip , is starting to reach last season 's heady heights ; and he provided further evidence of that as he strode through midfield before playing in @entity74 down the left			1
the @entity145 still had plenty to do , but the sheer ferocity in his left - foot effort saw the ball speed past home goalkeeper @entity150 at his near post			2
@entity74 wheeled away like it was nothing			0
the quality of the finish begged a question , though			0
with that in the locker why is the @entity159 - winner so far down @entity8 's forward pecking order ? it 's a question @entity74 , who has openly admitted he could quit @entity3 in search of regular football , wants answering next month			1
and @entity74 once again stated his case for regular first - team football in the 11th minute as he played a key role in @entity3 's second			1
under pressure from the @entity116 international , @entity45 lost possession in midfield ; @entity71 picked up the pieces before sliding a ball through to @entity25 who calmly rolled the ball past @entity176			0
it was the kind of unerring finish that became @entity25 's trademark last season			2
we 've not seen so much of it this term , perhaps a key reason behind @entity3 's troubles			1
@entity74 ( 9 ) pretends to polish @entity25 's boot as the @entity3 stars hail the @entity33 for his strike @entity25 met @entity190 's clearance to score a truly memorable goal in the @entity106 match @entity74 fires past @entity22 defender @entity193 to give @entity3 an early lead in the @entity106 clash the @entity145 forward wheels away in celebration of his early striker at the @entity88 on tuesday night @entity73 shares a moment with @entity74 as the @entity3 players celebrate the first half opener gunners midfielder @entity25 scored his first goal of the night with a neat finish past @entity22 goalkeeper @entity150 @entity205 pleased with ' dangerous ' @entity3 the criticism levelled at the @entity208 midfielder is that he 's been trying too hard to replicate the goalscoring exploits of last season ; something that has been noted by @entity8			1
it seems , however , @entity25 is finally finding his touch ; what was to happen later was testament to that			0
@entity74 was in no mood to share the limelight , though , as he set about making a statement to his manager			0
from a similar position to where he open the scoring , @entity74 hit the crossbar in the 20th minute , before hitting the side from an identical location a few minutes later			2
but @entity74 could only applaud what happened next though as @entity25 had the home supporters clapping in admiration with a truly breathtaking strike			2
there seemed no danger when @entity73 's corner was half - cleared to @entity25 35 yards out			2
however , after a quick touch to control , he unleashed an unstoppable half - volley that flew past @entity150 and into the top right - hand corner			1
but for a small section of a few hundred travelling fans , the @entity88 fell silent as they tried to comprehend exactly what had just happened			0
and , finally , as the realisation dawned on them an echo of applause rippled around the stadium			0
suddenly the 6 - 0 scenario that had been dismissed before kick - off did n't seem so far fetched			2
the @entity247 star watches his delicate 11th minute finish glide past @entity22 stopper @entity150 @entity25 celebrates scoring @entity3 's second goal of the night with team - mates @entity69 and @entity68 @entity251 ( right ) beats @entity37 to the ball but was unable to guide his header towards goal @entity3 striker @entity255 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity22 's @entity193 ( left ) during the second half @entity71 collides with @entity47 as the @entity259 winger looks to drive his team on in the first half @entity43 winger @entity73 looks to make a run at the home defence during an easy first half for @entity8 's side with their side unable to qualify for the knockout stages , the @entity88 was largely empty had @entity73 and @entity41 converted excellent chances before the break then it would certainly have been on the agenda			1
but @entity3 's momentum slowed when @entity8 brought off @entity25 - due to a hamstring issue - and @entity69 in place of two youngsters : @entity70 and @entity276 at half - time			1
even that decision looked the right one as news of @entity104 taking the lead against @entity108 filtered through			0
the second half , compared to the first was a none event ; @entity56 scoring a brilliant 88th minute consolation free - kick before @entity74 added @entity3 's fourth with the final kick of the game			1
by that time , though , @entity3 's minds were already on monday 's draw			1
@entity56 ( left ) is congratulated by @entity288 for his 87th minute free - kick @entity74 slides home his second and @entity3 's fourth of the night against a poor @entity22 side @entity75 and @entity74 celebrate the @entity145 's last minute strike which put @entity3 into a 4 - 1 lead			1

@entity3 finish in second place in @entity106 after 4 - 1 win against @entity22
@entity74 fires @entity43 into early lead with third - minute strike
@entity25 doubles @entity3 's lead with delicate finish past @entity150
@entity25 puts @entity8 's side 3 - 0 ahead with sensational first half volley
@entity56 hits stunning 89th - minute free - kick
@entity74 added another for @entity3 in stoppage time
