the families of two frail and elderly pensioners who died after being urgently moved from their troubled care homes have today criticised the government 's watchdog for the rushed closures			1
after more than a month of the authorities refusing to identify @entity8 and @entity9 , their names were today revealed			1
the 85 and 91 - year - old died days after they were evacuated from private care homes @entity12 in @entity13 and nearby @entity14 in @entity15 , respectively			1
their families fear the sudden closures caused the dementia sufferers unnecessary stress and anxiety			1
they want to know why a damning inspection report from health watchdogs went unpublished for eight months			1
the relatives said it could have flagged up serious problems at the homes , as they demanded better planning when relocating vulnerable people in future			0
mrs @entity34 , 91 , died from hypertension apparently brought on by the stress of being relocated from @entity41 with little notice on december 12			1
neither the coroner , the town hall registration officer , police , county council nor the local @entity48 trust would reveal mr @entity8 ’s name and other details of his case and that of mrs @entity34			1
and they have refused to open inquests into either death			0
@entity12 , which had the same owners as @entity41 , was given a clean bill of health in january last year , even though families said it was a ‘ hovel ’ and neighbours reported screaming to the police			1
mr @entity8 's family said they are in ' total shock ' that the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) failed to publish their early concerns about @entity41 for eight months , and believe the information could have pointed to problems at @entity12			1
staff called for another inspection in september after raising concerns and the @entity65 found an ‘ overpowering ’ smell of urine and patients forced to wash in cold water			2
but rather than replacing or overseeing the management until the residents could be re-homed , the watchdog suddenly ordered the home to close , declaring it a ' serious risk ' to residents			0
residents were evacuated on a freezing cold night as @entity12 park was shut , but ambulances ordered by the council failed to show , leaving the elderly people shivering shock : family members of those living at @entity12 were told about the move only hours earlier elderly residents were left shivering in their pyjamas on december 9 as @entity12 was shut and ambulances ordered by the council failed to turn up			1
family members were told about the move only hours earlier			0
mr @entity8 ’s family accuse the @entity65 of closing the home at too little notice , causing immense upheaval			1
mr @entity8 's son @entity98 , told the @entity99 : ' could n't somebody have moved into that home and looked after those people ? ' whoever made the decision to do what they did , and the time of what they did , that was wrong			1
' the @entity65 and social services - they are the people who have to answer the questions			2
' the @entity65 last night apologised for the distress but said responsibility lay with the care homes ’ owners and the local councils			1
it insists it warned @entity120 four days before @entity12 was closed			0
a council spokesman said : ‘ when the @entity65 informed us of its intention to serve a notice on this nursing home our role was to organise alternative homes for everyone			1
‘ once the @entity65 ’s court order was issued , forcing the residents to leave , this had all been arranged			2
’ @entity133 said it was forced to act urgently after owners @entity134 and @entity136 decided to close @entity41 with just 72 hours ’ notice			2
thought to have made £ 650,000 a year from each site , the @entity141 couple live in a £ 2.5million home in south - west @entity143 and drive a fleet of luxury cars			2
@entity134 and @entity136 have repeatedly declined to apologise to the families they allegedly ran the homes on a shoestring and have repeatedly declined to apologise , with mrs @entity136 telling the @entity99 : ‘ we are not interested			0
’ a @entity133 spokesman said : ‘ we absolutely did not want to disrupt the lives of older , vulnerable people			0
we completely sympathise with the families involved			0
’ @entity155 , a @entity156 mp and former care minister , said : ‘ the conditions at @entity41 were shocking			2
the @entity65 were right to serve the notice to close the home			2
' however , i am concerned that it took so long for the @entity65 to publish the report from its first inspection – they had already picked up problems and relatives deserved to know			1
’ @entity167 , @entity65 's deputy chief inspector of adult social care in @entity143 , said : ' we are sorry that the report on @entity41 from an inspection last january was not published until september			1
' this was n't good enough - we know that our reports are an important source of information for the public , and that they - alongside regular monitoring visits they do themselves to check up on the safety of the people in their care - are useful for local authorities too			2
' when we identified serious concerns at both @entity41 and @entity12 , we took action straight away			1
the concerns at @entity12 represented a more serious immediate risk to people 's safety , so that home was closed immediately			1
' the failings identified at both homes were appalling , and the provider should be ashamed of the ' care ' their services were delivering			0
' police are investigating unexplained injuries suffered by four dementia patients at @entity41			2
with his doting granddaughter by his side , @entity8 celebrates turning 85 on christmas day in 2013			2
although fragile and bruised , he is surrounded by cards and a birthday balloon from his adoring family			0
less than a year later , mr @entity8 died after being forced out of his care home on one of the coldest nights of the year			1
mr @entity8 , 85 , died from bronchopneumonia , a lung infection usually linked to a cold or flu , after residents were moved from @entity210 ( pictured ) how the @entity99 reported the tragic events at the care homes last december the great - grandfather ’s death was shrouded in secrecy with a coroner deciding not to hold an inquest into his death and authorities refusing to reveal his name			1
mr @entity8 , who was known to friends as @entity222 , died from pneumonia less than 48 hours after the upheaval of the move from @entity12 in @entity226 , @entity13			1
his formal causes of death include bronchopneumonia , a lung infection usually linked to a cold or flu			0
he also had prostate cancer and a urine infection			0
his family are now calling for the @entity65 to answer urgent questions about why the ‘ terrible ’ evacuation was ordered with such little notice			0
their call is echoed by the family of @entity9 , a 91 - year - old great - grandmother who died less than two weeks after she was suddenly moved from the care home where she had lived for 25 years			1
they believe she would still be alive if she was not forced out so suddenly			0
mr @entity8 , who was married to @entity243 , 75 , had a son , two daughters , seven grandchildren and two great - grandchildren			2
the former office manager had become desperately unwell with dementia and was taken to hospital just over a year ago			0
while his family were reluctant to have him put in full - time care , they eventually had him placed at @entity12 , with the costs covered in part by the family and by his pension			2
mr @entity8 ’s son @entity98 , 55 , a construction manager from @entity258 , @entity13 , said they were in ‘ total shock ’ to discover there had been official reports of an ‘ overwhelming ’ smell of urine at @entity12 with residents forced to bathe in cold water			1
despite the @entity65 ’s findings , they believe inspectors should have managed a measured evacuation of the home , taking it over for a time before allowing residents to be moved when they were ready			1
instead , mr @entity8 ’s son was told about the move just a few hours before it took place on december 9 last year			1
mr @entity8 , who bruised easily and was suffering with a large pressure sore , was evacuated in the dark at about 5.30pm			0
his son said : ‘ could n’t somebody have moved into that home and looked after those people ? ' whoever made the decision to do what they did and the time of what they did , that was wrong			0
‘ the cqc and social services – they are the people that have to answer the questions			0
’ mr @entity8 ’s grandson @entity293 , 17 , added : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s right to just shut the place down and chuck people out in the cold			2
' he was already on the edge			0
that could have put him over the edge			0
’ mr @entity8 ’s daughter @entity301 said they were assured by the coroner he died of natural causes and not because of the move			1
mrs @entity34 was at @entity41 for nearly 25 years until the south @entity143 nursing home , which has the same owners as @entity12 , was evacuated on december 12 , at two days ’ notice			1
her family believe her death on christmas day , partly from hypertension , was caused by the upheaval			0
@entity313 , 62 , said he visited his mother the day after the move and noticed her anxiety			0
he added : ‘ from then on in she did n’t eat and she was reluctant to drink			0
the cause for her not being here now is the move , ’ he said			0
‘ it was the suddenness of it – not being able to prepare for it			0
the swiftness of the move was too much stress and led to her sudden deterioration			0
they [ the @entity65 ] had known all that time but they left it until the last minute			0
lessons need to be learnt from this			0
