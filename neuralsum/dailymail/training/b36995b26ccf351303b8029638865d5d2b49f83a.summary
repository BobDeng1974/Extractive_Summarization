by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has now marked 50 games in charge of @entity5			1
sunday 's trip to former club @entity7 will be his 51st at the helm			0
it is , however , unlikely to be a milestone he will be celebrating			0
rather , it may well come as a point of relief that he has survived this far			0
for it is fair to say his steering job of the champions has proved a rocky ride			0
along the way there have been calls for him to go , each of @entity5 's 10 defeats triggering forensic analysis of his failings			1
all smiles : @entity2 will mark his 51st match in charge of @entity5 against his old club @entity7 there are sure to be similar inquests between now and the season 's end and , once the campaign does reach its conclusion , the question will be asked : does @entity2 deserve more time ? the theory , of course , is that time equates to success			1
many would argue that is a somewhat short - sighted stance , for a bad manager would merely worsen the plight of a club given too long to inflicts his ills			2
but history , in fact , shows that the best managers - those we house in the bracket of ' greatness ' - have been afforded time despite unspectacular starts			0
indeed , @entity59 can reveal that , over the first 50 games of their respective tenures , the likes of sir @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 did not fare as well as @entity2			1
the man in charge : @entity62 oversees @entity70 's match against @entity71 at @entity72 back in 1996 in black and white : sir @entity61 shared an identical start to @entity62 for their first 50 matches phone a friend : @entity64 , posing with son @entity77 , and @entity63 ( right ) , who managed @entity79 they did , of course , go on to enjoy silverware - laden stewardships having negotiated what were indifferent beginnings			1
@entity61 and @entity62 share an identical record of 22 victories , 18 draws and 10 defeats			1
@entity2 ' return of 27 - 9 - 14 is the equivalent of being six points better off ( * see below for our method of calculation )			2
this , then , suggests @entity2 should be granted the time to reverse fortunes at @entity97			2
in the current era , no manager has enjoyed a more lucrative return from their first 50 games than @entity103 during his initial spell at @entity105			1
in 2004 , the @entity106 , having arrived from @entity108 winners @entity107 , guided the @entity109 to @entity111 victory			0
his first half century produced just four defeats and our table has him collecting 118 points from a possible 150			2
the special one : @entity103 is unveiled at @entity118 for his first stint as @entity105 manager incidentally , our findings show current @entity123 boss @entity122 to be second best to @entity103 's effort a decade ago			1
indeed , his predecessor @entity125 earned the equivalent of 20 points less than the current incumbent			2
of the managers who have survived testing times before subsequently flourishing , @entity129 is perhaps the best example			0
he was promoted to the role of player - manager at @entity71 in 1961 with the @entity136 club in the second tier			0
of his first 50 matches , 24 were to end in defeat			1
the board kept faith and , by 1974 and before @entity129 's exit for @entity143 , they had won two league championships , two @entity145 , one @entity146 and one @entity147			0
@entity148 is another who endured criticism during the early days of his reign			0
today , the @entity79 boss is on the brink of sealing his club 's first title in 24 years , and he 's still only 93 games in to his @entity157 stay			0
so does @entity2 deserve a second season to turn things around ? look at our table below and the evidence suggests he probably does			2
