by @entity0 home secretary @entity1 faces questions from mps over accusations that politicians , the police and even her own officials have suppressed allegations against powerful individuals for decades extraordinary new claims pointing to an @entity12 cover - up of child sex abuse by senior politicians emerged last night			1
home secretary @entity1 faces questions from @entity3 over accusations that politicians , the police and even her own officials have suppressed allegations against powerful individuals for decades			1
some 114 files ‘ potentially relevant ’ to child abuse are now known to have been lost or destroyed by the @entity18			1
and , incredibly , at least four specific allegations relating to child abuse in @entity18 files were not passed to police for up to 35 years , officials have now admitted			1
the claims have only been handed over in the past 12 months			0
in an explosive intervention , former @entity26 cabinet minister @entity25 said the evidence suggested there ‘ may well have been ’ an @entity12 cover - up , beginning in the 1970s and 1980s and continuing to this day			1
‘ at that time i think most people would have thought that the @entity12 , the system , was to be protected , and if a few things had gone wrong here and there , that it was more important to protect the system than to delve too far into it , ’ @entity25 said			2
the peer , who served in the @entity39 in the early 1980s , added : ‘ that view , i think , was wrong then and it has been spectacularly shown to be wrong now because the abuses have grown			0
’ his intervention fuelled growing demands for a full @entity46 - style public inquiry into a series of toxic allegations , including claims of abuse by the late @entity52 mp sir @entity51 and allegations of paedophile activity at parties attended by politicians and other prominent figures at the @entity58 in @entity59 , south west @entity60			1
mrs may – who yesterday remained silent on the scandal engulfing her department – will face a storm of criticism from mps as she gives a statement in the @entity69 today			0
in other developments it emerged that former @entity26 home secretary @entity72 has been questioned by police over an historical allegation of raping a woman and a @entity77 peer is under investigation after 12 men made allegations of ‘ horrific ’ child abuse dating back decades			1
police have also traced a child at the centre of the alleged @entity85 paedophile ring			1
the unnamed businessman , in his 40s and based in the @entity88 , claims he was abused by a politician when he was eight			0
mrs may will announce details of a fresh review of her department ’s handling of the affair by a leading @entity96 , but pressure for a public inquiry continued to grow , with 141 mps from all parties backing the call			0
in an explosive intervention , former @entity26 cabinet minister @entity25 said the evidence suggested there ' may well have been ' an @entity12 cover - up , beginning in the 1970s and 1980s and continuing to this day @entity77 mp @entity107 has launched a petition calling on the prime minister to ‘ make amends for historic failures ’ by establishing a national inquiry into allegations of organised child sex abuse			1
he said that ‘ many survivors of child abuse believe they have been let down by the system of child protection in the @entity119 ’			1
the petition has already been signed by thousands of members of the public			0
mr @entity107 said : ‘ thousands had nowhere to turn			0
nobody listened and nobody helped			0
’ the @entity18 launched a review last year to discover what had happened to a dossier of alleged paedophile activity handed to @entity72 by the late @entity26 mp @entity130 in 1983			1
in a statement last week , @entity72 insisted that it had been handled appropriately and that he had asked officials to investigate the claims fully			0
but a public letter written by the @entity18 ’s top civil servant @entity136 at the weekend revealed that the review found dozens of files were missing			1
of the 573 files recovered , 13 contained ‘ information about alleged child abuse ’ , including four involving @entity18 officials			1
incredibly , only nine of the files – dated between 1979 and 1999 – were ever handed to police			2
in other developments it emerged that former @entity26 home secretary @entity72 has been questioned by police over an historic allegation of raping a woman @entity151 , @entity77 chairman of the @entity152 , said he was shocked by the loss of files , which he said was on ‘ an industrial scale ’			1
mr @entity151 , who had opposed a public inquiry into the scandal , said he had changed his mind on the basis of the revelations			0
his committee will question mr @entity136 tomorrow over the missing files			0
@entity26 mp @entity163 said the case for a public inquiry was now irresistible			0
he said : ‘ the home secretary is going to have to think again			1
it is inconceivable that those files were all lost by accident – no one is ever going to believe that , whatever the latest review comes up with			2
we need a proper inquiry			0
it is possible that some of the revelations will be very ugly for the political class			0
but we may need that cathartic experience to clear the air			0
’ @entity77 mp @entity180 , who last week called on @entity72 to reveal what he knew , said it was a scandal that the @entity18 had not passed files containing potentially serious allegations to the police immediately			1
and he warned that senior figures in all three main political parties were still trying to prevent questions about past misdeeds by a small number of mps and peers			2
he said @entity193 may be on the verge of a ‘ @entity196 - like scandal ’			2
the @entity18 declined to comment yesterday but @entity197 insisted the case for an ‘ over-arching ’ public inquiry had not yet been made			1
@entity201 of the law firm @entity203 , which is representing some of the alleged victims , said another internal @entity18 review would not quell the growing public disquiet			2
‘ this can not be another internal review held by those who may well be at fault , ’ she said			2
‘ it will only fuel a growing suspicion amongst the electorate that there is a conspiracy over the abuse of children by those with great power			2
’ shadow home secretary @entity219 warned the ‘ review of a review ’ announced by the government was insufficient			1
in a letter to @entity224 may she said : ‘ any stones left unturned will leave concerns of institutional malaise , or worse a cover - up , unaddressed			2
’ ‘ to be relevant , and effective , any independent inquiry needs to create a safe environment for survivors of abuse to come forward so their voices can be heard			1
at the moment the allegations are so serious and go so far up in the government , to make many survivors fear for their safety			0
’ campaigners are calling for a ‘ @entity46 - style ’ inquiry into historic allegations of child sex abuse			1
this would involve an independent board of experts similar to the panel that investigated the 1989 football disaster			0
public inquiries have traditionally been led by one or more senior judges , as with the @entity250 into the @entity252 killings of 1972 and the @entity253 into press standards			0
more rarely they have been conducted by a panel of veteran @entity258 mandarins – for example the @entity260 into the @entity261			0
but the @entity262 , set up in 2010 to ensure the release of all documents related to the tragedy in which 96 @entity267 fans died , was praised for being different			0
it was chaired by the @entity269 , the right reverend @entity270 , and the nine members included former @entity273 journalist @entity272 , a retired deputy chief constable , an ex-deputy chief medical officer and archive experts			0
each brought specialist knowledge to the task of scrutinising more than 450,000 pages to uncover the truth about attempts to cover up police failings			2
