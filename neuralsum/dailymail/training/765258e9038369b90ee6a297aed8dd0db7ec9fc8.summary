@entity1 manager @entity0 will make a personal plea to @entity3 to stay at the club next season following the @entity7 final			1
the future of goalkeeper @entity3 will be one of the key issues for @entity1 to resolve this summer			0
the @entity11 was expected to rejoin @entity12 for a fourth consecutive season - long loan deal once he signed a new @entity15 contract			0
however , @entity0 wants @entity3 to return to west @entity27 next season to compete with @entity28 for the no 1 jersey			1
@entity0 and @entity3 are yet to hold face - to - face talks with regarding the keeper 's future , with the @entity33 taking the decision to wait until the end of @entity12 's season before speaking to the @entity38 international			2
but the special one is due to meet with the 21 - year - old in the days after the all - @entity42 final on may 24 , where he will tell @entity3 he wants him to play for @entity1 next season			0
watch your back : @entity0 wants @entity28 to have competition for the no 1 spot next season @entity3 is settled in the @entity49 capital and would happily stay with @entity12 for another season			1
after establishing himself as one of the best keepers in @entity54 this season , sitting on the bench at @entity1 next season does not appeal to @entity3			0
however , @entity3 must follow @entity1 's instructions given he still has two years to run on his deal , though the @entity15 are keen not to upset the goalkeeper given he is yet to sign a new @entity15 contract			1
fail : @entity0 has overseen only @entity1 's fourth season without a trophy in the @entity65 era			2

@entity0 to make personal plea to @entity11 for him to stay at @entity1
the @entity1 boss wants him to return to compete with @entity28
it was thought @entity3 would stay with @entity12 on loan for another year
@entity3 must follow @entity1 's lead , with two years left on his contract
