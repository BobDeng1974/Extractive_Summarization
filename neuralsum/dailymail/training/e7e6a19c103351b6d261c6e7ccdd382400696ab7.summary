@entity9 's future at @entity7 is once again uncertain with elements of the club ’s board believed to be keen for him to leave before the end of the season			1
it has long been assumed within the club that the @entity18 would leave at the end of this season			1
but @entity19 understands there are factions of the club ’s hierarchy who would rather see @entity9 leave sooner , with @entity7 struggling in the @entity25			1
under the cosh : @entity19 understands senior board members at @entity7 want @entity9 gone weak : the @entity28 were dismal in their defeat at @entity30 and @entity9 could go before the end of the season they were dire in falling 2 - 0 against @entity30 on saturday and go into the weekend ’s south @entity35 derby against @entity36 only two points clear of the bottom three			1
@entity39 told the @entity40 on sunday night that the club were not discussing a move to sack the manager – a measure they have not taken since @entity46 was dismissed 10 years ago			0
furthermore , senior figures at the club believe it is unlikely that such a drastic step would occur			1
however , the board is extremely unhappy with the team ’s performances on the pitch and there are elements who believe a quick change might be necessary to avoid a relegation fight			0
not happy : the manager vented his anger at defender @entity62 after he got @entity63 sent off trouble : there were serious disagreements at board level over the signing of £ 12m @entity68 it is sorry state of affairs for a manager who led @entity7 to their first major trophy last season and has guided the team to historic wins at @entity76 and @entity77 this season			0
but he came extremely close to leaving in the summer and the team has struggled enormously to gain any kind of consistency in results or performances in this hectic campaign , in which they have done well to reach the knockout stages of the @entity89			0
part of the issues in the summer surrounded @entity9 ’s frustration over transfers , in particular suggestions that they sign @entity96 or @entity97			2
he was ultimately backed to sign @entity68 for a record transfer fee of £ 12million , but @entity96 was signed on deadline day on loan from @entity101			0
@entity9 is currently in @entity102 on holiday and due back on tuesday			2
dismal : the latest defeats means @entity7 have won just one league game since the start of december			0
