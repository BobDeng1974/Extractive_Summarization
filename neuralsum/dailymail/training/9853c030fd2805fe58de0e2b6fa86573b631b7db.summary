by @entity0 published : 00:36 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 5 april 2013 a @entity2 fan built a 5ft - high alien city out of 200,000 bricks in an eight - month labour of love			2
@entity7 , from @entity8 , spent 600 hours creating @entity9 , which is 6ft wide , since coming up with the idea last august			1
the project started out as a large castle that then spread out to become a sprawling hilltop city called @entity14 , complete with tall towers , bridges and space ships hovering above it			2
the design director , whose previous @entity2 efforts include abandoned homes , said : ' i have been using @entity2 for almost three years now as an art medium			1
' my pieces reflect my current state of mind and interests , so this one is about spirituality , which is my greatest interest			0
' through studying different forms of spirituality , i came across the connection to @entity47 , which until now i had always thought stuff like that and ets was just silly nonsense			0
it took eight months of painstaking work to assemble the @entity2 alien city mr @entity7 has already raised nearly £ 3,000 in donations from fans keen to support him as he builds more cities ' our media trivialises @entity47 and @entity61 phenomena as silly tabloid fodder			1
movies often demonise the idea through attacks to @entity66 so that was my thinking behind this			0
' now mr @entity7 is asking for fans of his work to donate through fund - raising site @entity70 so he can buy enough @entity2 to create more cities , that celebrate ' extra-terrestrial contact events , spiritual beings and unique worlds '			1
he has already raised nearly £ 3,000 ( $ 4,400 ) in donations .			0

design director @entity7 , from @entity8 , started ' @entity9 ' last august
he takes his creations apart afterwards because of the cost of @entity2
now he wants fans to support him to build more cities through donations
