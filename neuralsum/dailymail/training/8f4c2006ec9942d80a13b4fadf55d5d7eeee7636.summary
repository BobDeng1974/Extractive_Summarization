@entity15 is accused of shooting his wife with his department - issued gun in october 2007 at their @entity31 home and then trying to make her death look like a suicide			1
accused : prosecutors have depicted @entity15 as a philanderer whose marriage was crumbling , and say he killed his wife after she found out he had staged the theft of his pickup truck to collect the insurance proceeds the less - than - perfect crime : @entity25 was killed when her husband allegedly shot her in the mouth and tried to make it look like a suicide during his testimony , @entity15 frequently broke down and had to take breaks when he recounted his ill treatment of his late wife throughout their marriage			1

@entity26 's move to call @entity15 in his own defense drew gasps on wednesday from a packed courtroom			1
throughout the trial — which has seen four former mistresses of @entity15 and his current wife testify — @entity26 has maintained that his client was a victim of an overly aggressive detective and a botched investigation			2
the other side of the law : former @entity3 police officer @entity15 seen here in his mugshot after allegedly murdering his wife by calling @entity15 to the stand , @entity26 opened him up to questioning from prosecutors , who say @entity15 committed the ' perfect crime ' to cover up an insurance scheme involving the staged theft of a truck			2
under a testy cross-examination , prosecutor @entity93 pressed @entity15 to point to the ' deciding moment ' he sought to stop having affairs with other women , especially since he had sex with a woman in the home he shared with his wife just a few weeks after her death			1
' i was lonely , ' he said			0
@entity93 also asked @entity15 why he left a loaded gun at home with depressed wife and two children			2

other witnesses said @entity25 was having an affair with an @entity3 police officer who was married to the maid of honor in their wedding			0
they had sex in the back of a hair salon where she worked , according to testimony			0
the case has threatened to further tarnish the reputation of the beleaguered @entity153 , which already is under investigation by the @entity155 over a series of police shootings			0
