@entity2 , 24 , had dropped out of the @entity18 weeks before the attack and was nearing the end of his grace period for staying at the institution 's accommodation			1
@entity12 police chief @entity24 also hinted that @entity2 had recently gone through a break up and that authorities were investigating the claim			1
the new details may give some insight into what pushed @entity2 over the edge			1
a former classmate from the @entity18 suggested another cause for the killings , describing @entity2 as someone who had lost touch with reality after becoming ' obsessed ' with video games			1
the classmate told the @entity39 : ' @entity2 was obsessed with computer games and was always playing role - playing games			1
' i ca n’t remember which one but it was something like @entity46 , one of those where you compete against people on the internet			0
' he did not have much of a life apart from that and doing his work			1
@entity2 seemed like he wanted to be in the game and be one of the characters			1
' it seemed that being online was more important to him than real life			2
he must have lost his sense of reality , how else can you shoot dozens of people you do n’t know ? ' it is also believed that @entity2 was due to be evicted from his flat			1
the 24 - year - old , who is now in police custody , pulled out of the university weeks before the deadly attack			1
@entity70 told @entity71 anyone living in the block had to be enrolled at the university otherwise you had 30 days to evacuate			1
earlier @entity12 police chief @entity24 addressed the hunt for a motive for @entity2 's murderous actions , telling @entity92 ' @entity93 : ' i ’ve heard one morsel of information about a relationship that may or may not be true			1
' that ’s why we have all our investigators working on this			0
that ’s why we brought in the @entity104 behavioral analysts			0
they ’re going to figure all that stuff out			0
' there will be no easy or quick answers			0
and maybe there will never be any answers			0
this requires a lot of work			2
and we ’re just not in a position to give any indications of that now			0
' and again , whatever we do develop , the proper place to make sure we get proper justice for the victims is to reveal that stuff in the course of the criminal prosecution			0
' this clue came out on the same day as it was revealed that in addition to a profile on adultfinder.com , @entity2 also had a profile active on the dating website , @entity130			1
on both profiles , he wrote a chilling message to viewers which said ' will you visit me in prison ? ' during the same interview , @entity138 said that they had spoken with someone who was an acquaintance of the 24 - year - old shooting suspect , leading many to initially fear that the investigation had not come to an end			2
' i 'm not quite sure what the term person of interest means , ' mr @entity24 told @entity147			0
' this was a person who had contact with the suspect , a casual acquaintance			0
we found him yesterday , we interviewed him			0
' during the talk with @entity93 's @entity156 , mr @entity24 was quick to downplay the questioning			0
' the relationship was really inconsequential and we 're happy that we spoke to him			0
that 's all that was , ' he said			0
a witness at the scene initially said that he thought he saw a second man helping @entity2 during the attack			1
the male witness who saw @entity2 launch his deadly attack says he thought he also saw someone open the doors of the movie theatre to let the shooter in			1
inspecting carefully : police and fire officials carried out the search of @entity2 ' apartment anti-social : @entity2 was thought to be a recluse who covered his windows with black garbage bags so that no one could see in insight : pictures have not been released of the interior of his apartment , so the only glimpses come from the outside looking in the witness , who has not been named , told @entity189 it appeared that a cinemagoer who left the screening after receiving a telephone call deliberately left the emergency exit open			1
@entity2 used the emergency exit to access the screening of the @entity197 blockbuster in @entity12 , @entity7			1
the witness said : ' as i was sitting down to get my seat , i noticed that a person came up to the front row , the front right , sat down , and as credits were going , it seemed like he got a phone call			0
' so he went out toward the emergency exit doorway , which i thought was unusual to take a phone call			0
and it seemed like he probably pried it open , or probably did not let it latch all the way			0
' as soon as the movie started , somebody came in , all black , gas mask , armour , and threw a gas can into the audience , and it went off , and then there were gunshots that took place			0
' mr @entity24 was clear to mention that while they were still trying to determine the circumstances leading up to the fatal attack - and what , if any , motive the young man had - he said that police are confident in saying that he acted alone			1
' all the evidence we have , every single indicator , is that this was all mr @entity2 ' activity			2
he was n't particularly aided by anyone else , ' mr @entity24 said during the interview			0
massacre : 12 people were left dead and 58 injured in the @entity7 shooting the first time that police began to think that there may have been an accomplice was when a local officer received a threatening electronic message saturday evening , demanding that @entity2 be released from custody or else the sender would become violent			1
the sender and the format of the message have not been released publicly , but police investigated the threat and appear confident that there was no accomplice			0
they spent hours on friday and saturday in @entity2 ' apartment , dismantling the many booby traps and explosives that the madman had set up to kill whomever entered his apartment			2
unconfirmed reports state that @entity2 had a @entity260 poster adorning one of the walls			2
police chief @entity263 would not comment on the poster , but photographers did capture a portion of a different poster while investigators were examining the shooter 's apartment			1
witness : this man claims to have seen someone leave the emergency exit of the cinema open for @entity2 near the beginning of the film @entity279 told the @entity280 that he has known @entity2 for more than a decade and they also both attended undergraduate school at the @entity283 , @entity283 , where they saw each other once a week to watch the television series @entity285			2
they last met in december for dinner and a movie			0
mr @entity279 says at the time , @entity2 seemed fine			2
he also says academics came easily to @entity2 both at high school and at the @entity283			2
mr @entity279 says he remembers that in one college class they had together , @entity2 did n't take notes but would just sit through class and always got an @entity296 police have surmised that the grad school dropout had seemingly spent months planning the murderous assault , as he had amassed a stockpile of arms and explosives over long period of time			1
