rows upon rows of once - majestic aircraft are lined up in the baking heat of @entity6 's @entity5 desert , left abandoned in piles of metal			1
this is where planes go to die - a 2,600 - acre patch of @entity14 desert where several generations of military aircraft are stored in what has been dubbed ' @entity18 '			1
now , @entity20 's @entity19 has created a stunning ' megapixel ' view of this eerie sight using satellite imagery that allows anyone to explore the area in unprecedented , three dimensional detail			2
the desert is a perfect place to store the mass of steel , because low humidity and rainfall means very little rust occurs			2
the hard soil also means they can be parked up without the need for building concrete ramps			0
engines , munitions , wiring and electronics are all recycled to help lower the cost of maintaining the current - day fleet			2
in 2005 , staff at the facility recycled more than 19,000 parts worth $ 568million ( £ 366million )			2
the @entity18 contains everything from enormous cargo lifters to bombers , @entity60 , @entity62 freighters and the @entity64 fighters			1
the planes go on and on , in rows with some appearing newly parked , while others are hidden in protective coverings to keep out the elements			2
the base , home to the @entity72 ( 309 @entity72 ) , carries out repairs to the craft and even gets some of them flying again			0
the site has been a curiosity for eagle - eyed @entity79 users since the satellite imagery software was launched in 2005 , but now for the first time it is available to view in high resolution			1
the $ 35billion ( £ 22billion ) worth of outdated planes is kept as spare parts for current models at @entity87 in @entity6			1
some planes are merely stored at the base between deployments , but for more than 80 per cent of the 4,200 aircraft that call it home , it is a cemetery of steel - 350,000 items to be called on when needed			1

in 2005 , staff at the facility recycled more than 19,000 parts worth $ 568million ( £ 366million )			2
the @entity14 government even allows the military in other countries to buy parts and even planes from the site			1
the facility is the size of 1,300 football pitches			0
' as long as there are aircraft flying , military and commercial aircraft boneyards will always be necessary to keep other planes in the air , ' aviation author @entity110 , who has visited @entity87 told the @entity117			1
' @entity118 of the storage yards typically performs a variety of functions from storing aircraft that are temporarily out of service but expected to return to the fleet , to reclaiming useable parts which are inspected , overhauled , and then held until needed by active aircraft , to dismantling of the aircraft carcasses			1
' the @entity18 contains everything from cargo lifters to bombers , @entity60 , @entity62 freighters and the @entity64 fighters the planes go on and on , in rows with some appearing newly parked such as the left images of the @entity136 , while others are hidden in protective coverings to keep out the elements , or lay in scrap heaps one of the reasons aircraft are kept here is because in the desert there is low humidity and rainfall which means very little rust occurs immediately after @entity152 , the @entity151 's @entity150 @entity149 established a storage facility for @entity154 and c - 47 aircraft at @entity87			1
today , this facility is the @entity72 ( 309 @entity72 ) , which has grown to include more than 4,400 aircraft and 13 aerospace vehicles from the @entity159 , @entity161 - @entity160 , @entity151 , @entity162			1
the planes are kept in various states of restoration , with some coming back to life long being abandoned at the @entity18			2
earlier this month , for instance , an enormous @entity168 - era bomber which first flew in 1962 was resurrected from the @entity159 's scrap heap to serve the nation once more			0

the military has used @entity87 as a plane storage facility for 60 years , and in recent years its unique landscape has been called on by @entity186 for such films as @entity188			0
while it is n't the only aircraft boneyard in the world , it is the largest , containing around 4,400 aircraft			1
planes that have served on aircraft carriers have to be washed to get rid of salt			1
all aircraft have their fuel tanks lines drained and any explosive devices are removed			0
ducts are covered with tape and the aircraft are painted over in white to help deflect the sun 's rays			0

the @entity136 , nicknamed @entity215 , was mothballed seven years ago at the @entity87			0
it took to the skies once more on february 13 after months of painstaking restoration , which saw damaged parts such as the fuel lines and hydraulic steering systems replaced to make her airworthy once more			0
when fully functional , ghost rider will be capable of unleashing 70,000lbs of weapons , conventional or nuclear , almost anywhere on the planet			0
the plane , which will be one of 76 kept flying the the @entity159 , has a range of 8,000 miles on one fuel tank , and can travel 650mph at altitudes as high as 50,000ft			0
in a published report on the restoration , colonel @entity234 , who piloted @entity215 , said : ' i 've been flying the @entity238 since the 80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years ... she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems			0
' it took a little under three hours for the flight and we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed			0

pictured here are b - 52s @entity280 – monthan @entity281 is a @entity159 base located within the city limits approximately five miles south - southeast of downtown @entity5 , @entity6			1

@entity285 shows a 2,600 - acres of @entity6 desert where several generations of military aircraft are stored
it lets you zoom in and look at the planes from both an angle and at using an aerial view of the site
boneyard contains everything from @entity60 , @entity62 freighters and the @entity64 fighters
some planes are merely stored at the site while others are recycles with their parts used in other aircraft
