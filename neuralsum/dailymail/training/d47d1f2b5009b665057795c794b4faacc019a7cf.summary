by @entity0 published : 04:11 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 04:11 est , 13 may 2013 dieters who join @entity2 lose five times more weight than those who go it alone slimmers who embark on a @entity8 diet lose a lot less weight than those who join a slimming group , according to a new report			1
the latest @entity14 study reveals that dieters who join @entity2 lose , on average , five times more weight than those who go it alone			1
researchers at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , compared weight loss among people following the @entity2 approach with those following a self - help approach			2
the findings showed that after both three and six months , people who followed the @entity2 approach achieved significantly greater weight loss than people who tried to lose weight on their own			1
average weight loss after three months in the @entity2 group was 8.6lbs , compared with 1.8lbs in the self - help group			1
after six months the difference in results between the groups was even more stark , with average weight loss in the @entity2 group 10.1lbs , compared with 1.3lbs in the self - help group			1
dr @entity42 , lead researcher on the study said : ‘ the difference in weight loss between the two groups is compelling			0
‘ whilst people in the @entity2 group demonstrated significant weight loss at six months , people in the self - help group started to re-gain weight			2
‘ over time , it is unlikely that @entity8 diets are successful			1
‘ also striking is the level of weight loss in the @entity2 group			0
simply put , more people in the @entity2 group experienced clinically meaningful weight loss which has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases			2
’ as part of the study , 147 people were asked to follow the @entity2 programme , while another 145 participants were asked to diet alone			2
those in the self - help group were provided with publicly available printed materials explaining basic dietary and exercise guidelines for safe weight loss			0
the study concluded that for the @entity2 group , the most important factor for weight - loss success was attending the meetings			0

@entity8 dieters lose just 1.8lbs @entity82 , @entity83 at @entity2 said : ‘ these results demonstrate that the @entity2 approach works			1
‘ we believe that our meetings provide a powerful element of regular group support , where people are motivated , supported and learn how to change their lifestyles - and we have all the tools available to help them , with online and mobile access to our programme			0
’ this is the latest published research which supports the body of clinical evidence that proves @entity2 to be an effective and sustainable weight loss approach			0
a one - year global study recently published in @entity100 indicated that overweight and obese adults referred to @entity2 lost more than twice as much weight as those who just received care from their gp practice			0
an independent study published in the @entity107 also concluded that community based weight loss programmes were more effective and cheaper than those provided by specially trained health professionals .			0
