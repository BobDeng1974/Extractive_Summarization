@entity0 , @entity1 mp for @entity2 , where one of his predecessors was @entity4 , said he may unmask someone ' much more important ' who allegedly abused boys at the notorious @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , which was used as a venue for a paedophile ring of @entity19			1
' i have been contacted by people making serious allegations			1
' the mp says he could use parliamentary privilege - which would give him legal immunity - to name the former influential mp			1
he added : ' it would be best for him to come forward of his own volition , but i would consider using privilege to name the parliamentarian			1
' mr @entity0 spoke as it emerged that disgraced former @entity32 chairman @entity31 faces questioning over an alleged cover - up of child abuse at @entity35 , a special school in @entity2 linked to local @entity36 mp @entity4			1
over three decades , boys as young as seven were repeatedly abused at the school by @entity4 and his cohorts			2
it was described as ' a sweet shop for paedophiles ' and pupils were driven to public toilets to have sex with men who had travelled from all over the @entity49			2
in 2012 - two years after @entity4 's death - the @entity50 admitted the mp should have been charged with historic child sex offences			1
at the time of the alleged cover - up , ex-methodist minister @entity31 was vice-chairman of the social services committee at @entity56 , which oversaw @entity35			2
he is to face claims that he and other @entity2 councillors ignored a series of damning reports detailing the abuse			2
this week @entity31 , 63 , who has been charged with three counts relating to possession of cocaine , ketamine and crystal meth , will receive a letter saying he must answer questions from @entity69 , who is leading the investigation into the council 's handling of the allegations			0
predatory : mp @entity4 , left , knew @entity31 , right , during their time together on @entity56 nine others are also part of the investigation			1
there is no suggestion @entity31 , who was also on the council 's education committee , was involved in any form of abuse at @entity35 , but his time on the council coincides with key developments in the alleged cover - up			0
@entity89 , leader of @entity56 , said : ' the letter is quite strong , and they should be worried because the allegation is that they took part in a cover - up			0
so if they knew and decided not to do anything that is a very serious matter			0
' there are criminal issues here			0
' fears that vulnerable young boys were being abused at the school were repeatedly raised between 1988 and 1992 , when @entity31 held key council posts			0
three reports were issued detailing serious sexual abuse at @entity35 , yet no one was ever held to account			0
it was not until 1994 that the matter was raised again when the reports were discovered by the school 's head of care , @entity113			0
mr @entity115 's inquiry will cover the years 1985 to 1995 and will focus on whether there was a cover - up			0

@entity1 mp @entity0 may unmask someone ' much more important '
he may use parliamentary privilege *protection* to name the former mp
@entity0 has urged the politician to come forward of his own volition
