by @entity1 reporter published : 10:55 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 2 december 2013 for any father , time spent on the road away from his children is difficult			1
@entity7 , who spends a third of the year away , wanted to make sure he had a shared hobby with @entity10 , aged eight , and @entity11 , six , to make sure they stayed close			2
so the inventor and part - time tattoo artist from @entity15 took to colouring in his children 's drawings when had to work away from home , and he has transformed them into amazing works of art. @entity7 colours in his children 's drawings to pass the time on flights : he explains on his website that this was the second drawing from his daughter , and the first he remembered to take before and after photographs mr @entity7 explained that he invents industrial equipment designed to protect the world 's marine ecosystems			1
in order to pay for this , he travels 10 days every month to @entity34 , where he owns a high - end tattoo studio			2
' my children like to draw me pictures for my trip so i can keep them close to me while i 'm away , ' he said			2
@entity41 's monster ? : mr @entity7 says on his third trip his son wanted to get in on the act , so they both drew him something - on @entity48 paper elephant boy : @entity7 explains that his daughter , aged five at the time , drew an ' elephant boy ' for him , telling her that it tells her things in her dreams			1
' i thought this would be the neatest way to color it at the time ' ' one day my daughter did n't get around to making me a picture in time , so right before i left she quickly drew me a line drawing to take with me			0
' on my flights to work i keep a sketchbook to draw on the plane and have coloured pencils handy			0
this one particular trip , instead of drawing in my sketchbook , i decided to colour in my daughter 's drawing in the manner in which i would colour my own work			2
' when i returned home , i gave her the picture and she loved it so much that we started a tradition of me collaborating with both of my children each month on drawings to be coloured by me on my trips			1
' lady in @entity81 : @entity7 wrote on his website : ' i got in trouble for this one			2
apparently she was n't supposed to have a red shirt			0
i had to claim artistic license with my contribution and that was that ' special commission : this effort was a request from the children 's mother who wanted them to draw some chickens for her birthday to decorate the kitchen his pictures have now become a hit online after he shared them on his @entity104 account , drawing an overwhelmingly positive response			1
he explained on his website that he started the process two years ago , and after a few months he asked his daughter to draw him another one			0
his son subsequently wanted to be included			0
@entity111 pumpkin : @entity7 explained that he sometimes forgets to take a ' before ' picture because just starts colouring - like this scary effort from son as well as using colouring pencils on the flights , mr @entity7 has also tried filling the drawings in using digital technology , but following the comments online , he will now stick to pencils			1
alien with a scar : he tried colouring in some of the sketches digitally - in this case an @entity124			0
however after online feedback , he says that he will stick primarily with penciles from now on this coloured drawing of an owl was the first time @entity7 forgot his pencils on his flight , so he experimented with his ipad cats in love : a third drawing from his @entity124 creations			1
he has decided to stick with pencils however , explaining on @entity104 : ' the overwhelming positive response towards the pencils have convinced me to stick to them ' now his newfound fame has led to calls for him to publish the illustrations in a book from online fans - as well as his wife			1
' personally i â€™ve just been doing this because the kids love it , and i love collaborating with them and seeing their faces when the pictures go in a frame and up on the wall , ' he said			0
friendly bat : mr @entity7 explains that sometimes his children forget to give him drawings so he digs old pictures out of his camera , such as this one after his drawings became known to a wider audience , he wrote on his @entity163 account : ' dangit			1
i guess my @entity104 account is public now			0
but i got ta tell ya , the kids are besides themselves seeing their work online			1
' tattoo artist @entity7 ( r ) and the image that started it all			2
he writes on his website : ' i did this one a few years back on a whim to see how it would look if i colored one of my 4 yr old daughter 's pictures			0
this is the one that started it all for me			0
' he started taking before and after pictures after this one			0
