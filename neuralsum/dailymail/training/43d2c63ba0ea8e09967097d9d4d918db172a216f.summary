the speed limit on one of @entity3 ’s busiest motorways is to be cut from 70mph to 60mph under a controversial plan to meet @entity6 pollution targets			1
the first ‘ environmental ’ speed limit is set to be imposed within months on a 32 - mile stretch of the @entity9 – for seven days a week , from 7am to 7pm the limit will be in place for several years , and any driver caught breaking it faces a hefty fine and penalty points on their licence			1
' @entity19 ' scheme : a 60mph speed limit will be imposed within months on a 32 - mile stretch of the @entity9 ( pictured )			1
it will be enforced from junction 28 , near @entity24 , @entity25 , to junction 35a , north of @entity27 , @entity28 the @entity29 said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway , and is ‘ not ruled out ’ on up to a dozen major routes			1
a busy stretch of the @entity35 near @entity36 is among those currently being assessed for anti-pollution measures			0
motoring groups said it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty			1
and the restricted route will still be subject to variable speed limits to keep traffic flowing during congested periods , leading to regular caps of 50mph or 40mph			0
traffic build - up : the @entity9 ( pictured ) , which runs from @entity36 to @entity48 , is one of the country 's busiest motorways the @entity29 admitted it will be the first time a motorway speed limit has been cut on environmental rather than safety grounds , but insisted the plan was backed by ministers			1
the limit will be enforced on the @entity9 from junction 28 , near @entity24 , @entity25 , to junction 35a , north of @entity27 , @entity28			2
motorists will be able to drive at the standard 70mph on the rest of the @entity9 , which runs from @entity36 to @entity48			0
criticism : @entity65 president @entity64 has slammed the scheme - saying it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty the restriction will apply from 7am to 7pm seven days a week and be enforced by speed cameras and police patrols			1
the route is part of a £ 400million ‘ smart ’ motorway scheme , under which technology is used to manage traffic flow and the hard shoulder can be used to ease congestion			0
it passes @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 – and also includes nine so - called @entity84 described as ‘ pockets of poor air ’			0
although the @entity29 said the lower speed limit will be in place until pollution dropped to acceptable levels , it admitted the 60mph restriction was likely to remain for several years			1
it said a lower speed limit was needed to ensure new @entity6 guidelines on air quality , which come into force this year , will be met			1
@entity99 sources said last night that ‘ a handful ’ of other smart motorway schemes currently in the pipeline could have ‘ green ’ maximum speed limits imposed to meet air quality targets and avoid @entity103 fines			2
a section of the @entity35 from @entity108 near @entity36 is currently undergoing environmental assessment to see if measures will be needed to cut pollution levels			2
motoring groups reacted angrily to the plan , and warned of an alarming precedent and that wider use of the lower limit would have an impact on businesses			1
@entity65 president @entity64 said : ‘ billions spent on railways to speed up thousands of journeys while hundreds of millions spent on the @entity9 to slow down hundreds of thousands is an irony that wo n’t be lost on drivers			2
assessment : the @entity29 said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway			0
a section of the @entity35 ( pictured ) near @entity36 is currently undergoing environmental assessment ‘ smart motorways were intended to ease congestion and improve journey time reliability through use of the hard shoulder			0
‘ and here we have a scheme which costs around £ 400million to simply slow traffic down to 60mph with associated enforcement			0
clearly we can not have such a speed reduction when the @entity9 is empty			0
’ @entity144 technical director @entity143 said : ‘ worryingly , this could pave the way for similar restrictions on other sections of motorway			0
while preserving air quality is obviously a paramount concern there will inevitably be a negative impact on business efficiency and individual mobility			2
’ a @entity29 consultation on the plan began yesterday and will close on march 3 .			0

speed limit will be cut from 70mph to 60mph to meet @entity6 pollution targets
will be imposed on 32 - mile stretch of @entity9 between junctions 28 and 35a
drivers who break limit will face hefty fine and penalty points on licence
scheme ' not ruled out ' on other stretches of motorways , including @entity35
motoring groups claim limit will have negative impact on businesses
