the @entity0 fired its first openly - gay @entity1 this week since voting to allow homosexual youth to join the organization in january			1
@entity4 , a 49 - year - old @entity5 , was asked to start a new troop by a reverend at his inclusive methodist church in @entity9 last year and says he did n't conceal his sexual orientation from scouts , their parents or organization officials			1
while the @entity0 's recent decision allows openly - gay youth to join their ranks , it still bars homosexual men from being leaders			1
so when the @entity0 's national headquarters found out about @entity26 sexual - orientation earlier this week in the midst of a report by @entity29 , his position as a the leader of @entity23 was ' revoked '			1
mr @entity30 was invited to set up @entity23 in @entity9 last year by the pastor of an inclusive methodist church and says he was open about his sexuality with both members and officials no gay leaders : the @entity0 voted to allow gay youth into their ranks starting this year but that rule does not pertain to adult leaders			1
above , @entity4 addresses his troop at a parade @entity0 spokesman @entity42 says it was only until reporters contacted the organization about @entity4 for a story that they found out he was gay			1
' our policy is that we do not ask people about their sexual orientation , and it ’s not an issue until they deliberately inject it into scouting in an inappropriate fashion , ' @entity42 said in an email to @entity29			0
before his sacking , @entity4 believes he was the only openly - gay troop leader in the country			2
' it ’s extremely disappointing to not be fully supported and defended in my membership , ' @entity4 said			0
' they are complaining that the problem [ his status as an openly gay man ] is a distraction to @entity64 and they do n’t seem to understand that the distraction is self - inflicted			0
' @entity4 started leading @entity23 98 last fall after he was asked by @entity67 of @entity68			1
@entity69 wanted to start an inclusive troop for local youth , and reached out to @entity4 who attends the church with his husband of 20 years			1
@entity4 agreed to start the troop when asked by the reverend at his inclusive methodist church			2
he attends the @entity68 with his husband of more than 20 years ( pictured together above ) @entity4 was hesitant to start the group at first because he had his own troubled history with the @entity0			2
when he was 22 - years - old , @entity4 was offered the position of assistant scoutmaster but that was job was rescinded once his troop leaders figured out he was day			1
the troop was also sponsored by his @entity86 church , and he was additionally excommunicated from the religion			0
he agreed to start the program , in part inspired by the work of his straight twin - brother @entity91 who has publicly championed for gays to be admitted into to the scouts			0
wo n't stop : @entity4 says he will continue to lead the troop until relieved by his church 's reverend ' if you do n’t participate , you 're not part of the conversation , ' @entity4 , a software engineer , said			1
' yelling from the outside is not conversing			0
so we 're on the inside doing good work			0
talking about the gay and lesbian issue is not the biggest part of what we do — it 's the smallest part			0
' but @entity4 makes clear that his decision to lead the troop was not part of a publicity stunt , but because he genuinely wanted to help out the local kids			2
and his troop at @entity68 , including their parents , thank him for his work			0
' anyone who is willing to step forward and provide an opportunity for our youth should be supported , and @entity4 has done an excellent job , ' said @entity122 , whose son , 14 - year - old son @entity123 is in the troop			1
' if anyone has an issue with this , then where are they ? ' the troop currently consists of all straight boys , but gay high - schooler @entity132 , 17 , says he plans to join the troops after the end of the school year			2
@entity132 left another troop last year because it did n't feel gay - friendly			2
' i 'll be more comfortable going back into scouting and being in an inclusive troop , ' he said , adding that @entity4 will ' understand where i 'm coming from			0
' proud to be a scoutmaster : @entity4 waves a pride flag during an outing with his troop @entity4 certainly understands @entity132 's perspective , having experienced a similar isolation growing up and feeling like he was the only gay person around			2
' one of the things that ’s different now with our troop from when i was a youth in the @entity0 , was there were no identifiable gay or lesbian adults , ' @entity4 said			1
for his part , @entity4 hopes that ' cooler minds will prevail ' and he will be allowed to continue as scoutmaster			0
' that 's what i believe			0
if it does n't happen today , that will be disappointing			0
but it does n't mean it wo n't ever happen , ' he said			0
in a message on @entity169 , @entity4 said he has n't received an official notification from the @entity0 that he is no longer a scoutmaster and says he will continue to lead the group until told otherwise by his church 's revered			1
