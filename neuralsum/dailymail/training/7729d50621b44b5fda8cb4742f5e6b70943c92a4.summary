over the past decade the @entity23 royal family has spent billions of dollars expanding the @entity16 @entity25 pilgrims perform the final walk around the @entity27 at the @entity16 - the focal point of @entity29 last year @entity23 's royal family dropped initial plans to replace the sacred library , which stands on a raised plinth			2
there had been proposals to replace it with either a metro rail station that would serve pilgrims - or a sweeping new library dedicated to @entity40 , founder of the modern kingdom			0
the @entity43 who are in charge of the development , propose that it be razed to the ground and replaced with the imam ’s residence and an adjacent presidential palace , @entity42 reported			1
