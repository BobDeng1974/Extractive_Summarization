by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 20:39 est , 15 october 2012 @entity1 faces the humiliation of a @entity4 vote on whether his pay should be docked for swearing at police			1
@entity7 yesterday tabled a motion that could see the @entity10 chief whip lose £ 1,000 after police claimed he called them ‘ * * * * ing plebs ’ for refusing to let him cycle through the main gates of @entity14			1
that is the amount mr @entity1 could have been fined if , like most people who swear at a police officer , he had been successfully prosecuted			1
under - fire : @entity7 tabled a motion that could see @entity1 lose £ 1,000 after police claimed he called them ' * * * * ing plebs ' for refusing to let him cycle through the main gates of @entity14 @entity7 is expected to force a vote during the next opposition day debate – a move that could expose the lack of support for mr @entity1 among @entity29 and some @entity30			1
home secretary : @entity32 said the police officers involved had accepted mr @entity1 's apology ' and that is an end to it ' mr @entity1 has repeatedly denied calling diplomatic protection officers ‘ plebs ’ but he has admitted swearing , and @entity42 mayor @entity41 has said it would have been ‘ commonsensical ’ for mr @entity1 to be arrested			2
under section 5 of the @entity47 , guidelines for magistrates suggest that anyone convicted of the offence faces a fine equivalent to between 50 and 125 per cent of their weekly income			0
mr @entity1 ’s salary as chief whip is more than £ 79,000 and his weekly income from it is around £ 1,500			2
@entity7 mp @entity57 , who tabled the motion to dock mr @entity1 ’s pay , said : ‘ we still do n’t know what exactly @entity1 said to the police officers , nor has he offered a proper apology			1
' if the prime minister wo n’t act to clean up this mess then @entity65 should do it for him			0
’ as mr @entity1 took his place on the government frontbench yesterday for the first time since his outburst last month , he faced jeers from opposition mps			1
and in the first public criticism from his own party , former @entity10 whip @entity78 , who returned to the backbenches in last month ’s reshuffle , said that mr @entity1 ’s predecessor @entity82 , now @entity82 , is ‘ sorely missed as chief whip ’			2
and during @entity86 questions , @entity84 repeatedly demanded that ministers condemn mr @entity1 ’s behaviour			2
talks : mr @entity1 met @entity91 officials at his constituency office in @entity93 on friday shadow home secretary @entity94 sought to embarrass home secretary @entity32 by quoting her own words to the @entity91 last year in which she said : ‘ it ’s easy to sit round with friends and criticise the police			2
you put up with abuse and worse , but you do so to keep us free			0
it ’s time we gave you all the respect you deserve			0
’ ' we still do n’t know what exactly @entity1 said to the police officers , nor has he offered a proper apology			0
if the prime minister wo n’t act to clean up this mess then @entity65 should do it for him ' @entity7 mp @entity57 miss @entity94 called for mrs may to condemn mr @entity1 , but she refused			1
the home secretary said : ‘ the chief whip apologised to the police officers concerned and the police accepted that apology			0
the police are not taking the matter any further , and that is an end to it			0
’ mr @entity1 roared ‘ hear , hear ! ’ as mrs may came to his defence			0
a @entity14 spokesman made clear the prime minister has dug in his heels and is determined to hold on to his chief whip			0
he said : ‘ @entity1 behaved in a way that he should n’t have towards a police officer , but he has apologised and that apology has been accepted			0
’ mr @entity1 faces a further ordeal tomorrow when he will sit next to @entity133 during prime minister ’s questions when he will inevitably be made the butt of @entity138 ’s attacks on the government			1
and , also tomorrow , @entity10 mps are expected to complain about mr @entity1 ’s behaviour during a meeting of the backbench @entity143 .			1

@entity7 pushes for mps to vote on cutting the *beleaguered* minister 's pay
