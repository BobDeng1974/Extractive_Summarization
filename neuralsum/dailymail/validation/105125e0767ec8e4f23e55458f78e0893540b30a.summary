a wave of migrants 4,500 years ago left their trace in the dna and languages of modern @entity5			1
this is according to a study that found evidence of this @entity10 migration by analysing @entity3 of 69 people who lived across @entity5 between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago			1
among the shifts in the genetic make - up of ancient @entity5 they found that @entity3 associated with the @entity16 people appeared strongly in what is now northern @entity18			1
researchers have identified a mass migration of @entity22 populations ( @entity16 culture ) which went from the @entity25 steppes to the centre of @entity5 4,500 years ago			1
previously , researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the @entity29 , now modern day @entity30 , brought it to @entity5 there are two main theories as to how @entity34 spread in @entity5			1
the first is the @entity36 hypothesis , which claims spread of the language occurred some 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the @entity29 ( currently @entity30 ) brought it to @entity5			1
the @entity22 hypothesis , meanwhile , proposes that the language was spread by nomadic herders of the steppes found to the north of the @entity47 and @entity46			2
this theory suggests their language spread throughout @entity5 after the invention of wheeled vehicles , from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago			1
the @entity16 were herders who lived in the steppe north of the @entity55			1
this injection of @entity3 indicates ' a massive migration into the heartland of @entity5 from its eastern periphery , ' said the researchers , led by @entity61 of @entity62			0
such a large - scale influx would likely have affected not just the dna but ancient cultures as well			0
although genes ca n't determine what people spoke , the researchers argue that their findings could influence the debate about the origins of @entity34 tongues			0
indo - european languages include more than 400 tongues , from modern languages such as @entity75 and @entity76 to ancient languages like @entity78 and @entity79			0
@entity80 , which is spoken in south - west @entity81 and northern @entity82 , is not @entity34 , and may be the only surviving relic of earlier languages once spoken more widely , according to the @entity85			0
linguists have long debated whether @entity34 came to @entity5 with farmers migrating from the @entity88 or some other group , such as the @entity16			2
previously , researchers had believed that @entity34 language spread some 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the @entity29 , now modern day @entity30 , brought it to @entity5			1
the latest study suggests that @entity5 was first reshaped at this time in what archaeologists call the @entity96			0
farmers from @entity98 travelled north , bringing new technology and language into @entity5			2
this was followed by a second wave of people several thousand years later from what is today @entity105 and @entity25			0
the latest study suggests that @entity5 was first reshaped during the @entity96 8,500 years ago			1
farmers at this time travelled north , bringing new technology and language into @entity5			2
pictured is an early @entity111 35 - 40 year old male from , @entity112 , who was part of the first mass migration to @entity5 as well as genetic evidence , researchers point to the fact that many @entity34 share words for things like axles , harness poles , and the wheel			2
these devices were invented long after the @entity96 began in @entity5			0
' major language replacements are thought to require large - scale migration , ' said the authors of the study , which was published monday by the journal @entity129			0
' our results make a compelling case for the steppe as a source of at least some of the @entity34 in @entity5			2
' @entity135 , a linguist at the @entity136 , who was not involved in the study , said it was significant that the mass migration occurred at a time some models had previously identified for @entity34 expansion			0
' it fills in a significant piece of a big and interesting puzzle , ' said @entity135 .			0

study looked at dna of @entity5 who lived 8,000 and 3,000 years ago
dna associated with @entity16 people appeared in northern @entity18
@entity16 were herders from the steppe north of the @entity47 and @entity156 seas
this suggests a large influx that would have changed speech and dna
previously , researchers believed that @entity34 language spread some 8,500 years ago , by the first farmers from the @entity29 , now @entity30
