by @entity0 i 've done the best job of my life this week			1
i had to stand around in an @entity5 - like warehouse in south east @entity6 whilst several beautiful women sprayed body oil all over me			1
eight hours straight of female hands roaming all over my body - rubbing lotion , teasing hair , stroking and undressing me - all for the sake of art. well , all for the sake of my 2015 calendar anyway			1
yes , i know it seems strange to be talking about next year already when we are barely into @entity20 but they do things well in advance these calendar people			2
i 'm well aware that they were there to do a job , but nevertheless i enjoyed the attention			2
that said , four weeks ago when i was given the date for this shoot i was more than a bit concerned			1
i was not in great nick , i 'd let myself go a little bit with some pretty full - on partying and was looking decidedly lumpy and i knew that @entity43 and photographer @entity44 would want me in little more than my boxer shorts for most of the day			0
so i hit the gym hard and had quite a bit of help from my will power in a bottle - @entity51 diet supplements			0
@entity0 had great fun being man - handled by the women on set during his shoot @entity0 went for a mean and moody look for his calender but was happy to lark around when the cameras were n't on him if you are going to turn around weight - loss and toning quickly you have to be pretty committed			1
gym at least every other day - hour - long high intensity sessions			0
i went to @entity64 at @entity65 in @entity6			2
go hard or go home - there 's no point just standing round the gym watching other people			0
push yourself , get it done , and then feel good about yourself afterwards			0
ok , i 'll admit i felt pretty sick a few times when i first started , but one or two @entity74 in the morning helped with an energy boost , and then one in the afternoon to stop snacking			0
eating clean is another big must - 3 or 4 low or no carb meals a day and nothing after 7pm , and cut down on the booze and late nights ( ok , i was n't great at that )			0
in total i dropped 12lbs in four weeks and ta - da - now i do n't look to bad in a tight vest , pretending to be docker working hard down the shipyards			2
@entity0 was sprayed with body oil to achieve his sweaty look			1

@entity0 traveled to an @entity6 *studio* for his calendar shoot this week
the shoot lasted eight hours and *involved* a lot of body oil
@entity0 dropped 12 pounds in four weeks to look fit in front of the camera
