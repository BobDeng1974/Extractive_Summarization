doctors diagnosed @entity3 , 28,with variant @entity4 ( @entity4 ) last august and gave him just 14 months to live			1
mr @entity3 , said : ' i had trouble for quite a long time , going back four years			1
my doctors did n’t take it seriously , my headaches and coordination being off @entity16 just put it down to stress			0
' it was not until mr @entity3 , who has been a vegetarian for the past five years , moved to @entity20 two years ago that a doctor referred him to the specialist @entity23 in @entity24 where he was diagnosed with variant cjd			1
' my memory ’s bad and so is my coordination and sometimes i ca n’t see , ' he explained			0
' i get hallucinations sometimes , which is part the disease and part the medication			0
' i put toothpaste in the fridge once but i have no memory of doing it - it ’s kind of like sleep walking			0
' variant cjd is an incurable disease believed to be caused by exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( @entity42 ) which affects cattle			0
the vast majority of cases are caused by consuming beef contaminated with @entity42			1
contaminated meat contains an abnormal protein called a prion			1
prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells			0
it was not until mr @entity3 ( pictured ) , who has been a vegetarian for the past five years , moved to @entity20 two years ago that a doctor referred him to the specialist @entity23 in @entity24 where he was diagnosed with variant @entity4 symptoms include memory loss , balance and coordination problems , slurred speech , visual problems and blindness , abnormal jerking movements , progressive deterioration and immobility			1
most people with @entity4 will die within a year of the symptoms starting , usually from infection			1
this is because the immobility caused by @entity4 can make patients vulnerable to infection			1
there is currently no cure for @entity4 so treatment involves helping to relieve symptoms and making a patient feel as comfortable as possible			1
this can include using medication such as antidepressants to improve mood and painkillers to relieve pain			0
assistance with feeding may also be required			0
mr @entity3 said it took a long time for him to accept the news and it was n’t until a month later that he finally told his parents			1
mr @entity3 said it took a long time for him to accept the news and it was n't until a month later that he finally told his parents			1
he is pictured here with his friend @entity94 he said : ' it ’s harder for my parents because i think they feel quite powerless			0
' they said to me , " we want you to move home and look after you " , but i ’m just not ready to stop everything yet			0
' i think if you ’re just going to sit about and be sad , what ’s the point in going on anyway ? ' a few months ago mr @entity3 was forced to give up his job as a barman at the @entity107 pub , @entity20 , where he also performed as a drag queen			1
after stumbling a few times behind the bar due to his poor coordination , his friend @entity109 rounded up the troops and moved all of mr @entity3 ’s belongings into her home where he now lives			1
variant cjd is an incurable disease believed to be caused by exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( @entity42 ) which affects cattle.the vast majority of cases are caused by consuming beef contaminated with @entity42 ms @entity109 , 48 , said : ' it was just the right thing to do , i could n’t have stood back and left him - he ’s like my son			1
' now mr @entity3 is now organising a charity event to raise awareness of cjd and money for the @entity129 and @entity130 in @entity131			1
' it ’s for the future because they have got to find a cure for it one day and any money we raise is surely going to make a positive difference , ' he added			1
what is @entity4 ? @entity4 ( @entity4 ) is a neurdegenerative condition and the human equivalent of @entity42 or @entity42 ( @entity42 )			1
how is it transmitted to humans ? the vast majority of cases are caused by consuming beef contaminated with @entity42			1
contaminated meat contain an abnormal protein called a prion			2
prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells			0
they are very different in their behaviour to conventional viruses and bacteria , and are not destroyed by extreme heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses			0
antibiotic and antiviral medicines have no effect on prions			0
a government inquiry in 2000 concluded that the prion was spread through cattle that were fed meat - and - bone mix containing traces of infected brains or spinal cords			0
the prion then ended up in processed meat products , such as beef burgers , and entered the human food chain			2
is eating beef still risky ? strict controls have been in place since 1996 to prevent @entity42 from entering the human food chain and the use of meat - and - bone mix has since been outlawed			2
how common is @entity4 ? between 1996 to march 2011 , 175 cases of @entity4 were reported in the @entity187 and 49 cases in other countries from october			2
following the successful containment of the @entity42 epidemic in cattle , the number of cases of @entity4 in the @entity187 has declined since 2000			2
there were only five confirmed deaths in 2011			0
some experts believe that the food controls have worked and that further cases of @entity4 will continue to decline			2
as of january 2012 there were no patients with @entity4 , but this does not rule out the possibility that other cases may be identified in future			2
there is considerable uncertainty about how many people in the @entity187 population are incubating @entity4			2
a recent study based on random tissue samples suggested that around 1 in 4,000 might be infected with @entity4 , but show no symptoms to date			2
what are the symptoms ? symptoms include memory loss , balance and co-ordination problems , slurred speech , visual problems and blindness , abnormal jerking movements , progressive deterioration and @entity225 people with @entity4 will die within a year of the symptoms starting , usually from infection			0
this is because the immobility caused by @entity4 can make patients vulnerable to infection			0
is there a treatment or cure ? there is currently no cure for @entity4 so treatment involves helping to relieve symptoms and making a patient feel as comfortable as possible			0
this can include using medication such as antidepressants to improve mood and painkillers to relieve pain			0
assistance with feeding may also be required .			0

@entity3 , from @entity20 , was diagnosed with @entity4 last august and was given just 14 months to live
mr @entity3 has only been vegetarian for five years so would have been exposed to the contaminated beef when he still ate meat
he is organising a charity event to raise awareness of cjd and money for the @entity129 and @entity130 in @entity131
