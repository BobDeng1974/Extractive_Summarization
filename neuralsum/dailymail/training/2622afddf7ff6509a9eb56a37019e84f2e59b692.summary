the man popularly known as the fast - food visionary who inspired @entity4 's billion - dollar @entity3 has died of cancer - after never making one cent from them			1
@entity8 , 41 , who had a brainwave for the idea while watching tv in 2009 passed away on @entity12 , surrounded by his wife and two daughters , @entity15 , 19 , and @entity16 , 6 , after @entity4 donated just $ 1,000 towards his medical bills			1
vice president of media and information at the @entity21 , @entity18 lobbied @entity4 and the owners of @entity3 for two years using a much loved and humorous @entity24 campaign that had millions of followers and in march 2012 finally saw his hybrid snack become a reality			1
his friends and family set up a website to accept donations to help with his medical bills and on september 24th , @entity4 donated $ 1,000 to the fund after a friend reached out to the company via @entity49 according to @entity50			1
the fund for @entity18 was seeking to raise $ 10,000 and with @entity4 's donation exceeded this to make $ 11,525 for the father - of two			1
the same friends told @entity50 that @entity18 was a proud man ' with a good idea and a good heart ' and that he would never have set up such a site himself			2
indeed , his friends often urged him to seek some form of compensation for the taco , especially as he became one of its chief supporters through social media			0
modest to the end though , @entity18 told the @entity71 last year that he was not looking for money , the fact that the meal exists was enough			0
' everybody that i tell about this says ' you should be getting some money off these			0
' ' i 've never once said that i deserved any sort of compensation , ' he said			0
' i ca n't be the first person to think of this			0
' the @entity84 approached @entity4 for comment about their donation to @entity8 ' medical bills , but at the time of publication had not received a response			1
proud dad : @entity8 with his daughter , @entity16 seen here on his @entity95 fundraising website confirmation of donation : this grab taken from @entity8 ' you caring medical fundraising website shows that @entity4 put up $ 1,000 towards the 41 - year - olds treatment - of which $ 11,250 was collected in total since the launch the @entity3 , the range has been expanded to three different flavors and sales last year exceeded $ 1 billion			1
indeed , more than 600 million units have been sold to date and @entity4 , which is owned by @entity108 ! @entity109 , which also owns @entity110 and @entity111 , considers the item to be its most successful launch ever			1
however , @entity18 never received a penny , despite the acknowledgement from both @entity3 owner , @entity117 and @entity4 for his part in popularizing the game - changing fast - food snack			1
for his part , @entity18 always shrugged of any attention his bright spark brought him , simply happy to have had his ' cool idea ' come true			0
the story of how one man helped to change the face of @entity130 's fast - food habits began more than three years ago - his wife @entity131 said that her husband would often use @entity3 in taco salads			1
then in 2009 , @entity18 was eating a normal taco while watching the television and as he described it a ' lightbulb went off '			1
' i looked at my wife and said , ' how awesome would it be if this taco shell was a @entity142 ? ' recounted @entity18 in an interview last year with the @entity71			0
the idea would not budge and in late 2010 the successful businessman decided to write a letter to @entity117 to pitch it , but he soon got back a reply that basically said , ' thanks , but no thanks '			2
' imagine this … taco shells made from @entity3 , ' he wrote to @entity117			2
' i know … it ’s an amazing thing to ponder			0
' the chip - giant told @entity18 that they only accepted product ideas from employees			0
undeterred by this , @entity18 took to @entity24 to drum up the help of social media to make his dream to have orange @entity142 's tacos become a reality			2
grief : @entity131 told @entity84 : ' obviously it 's going to be tough for us			2
i think it 's sweet that all of his friends are doing this for him '			0
she added that she thinks @entity8 would be embarrassed by the campaign his page was entitled ' @entity172 from @entity173 ' onto which he posted updates of his campaign and celebrities holding the as - yet unreal fast - food snack			1
eventually , the page racked up over 3,000 likes			0
the online food blogs of the @entity181 , @entity182 , and @entity183 had linked to the page			0
the page views soon spiked over a million			0
with his social media campaign and public swell of support , it is unclear how much influence @entity18 actually had on the decision to go ahead with the snack			0
one day , @entity8 noticed @entity4 had commented on one of his images			1
' he was really excited , ' @entity131 said to today			0
' @entity4 was paying attention to him			0
of course , we called everyone we knew			0
' then , out of the blue in february 2012 , @entity18 received a phone call from @entity4 , to invite him to their @entity32 headquarters where they were going to show him something special			2
one of his final posts : this humorous post was one of the final updates that @entity18 made to his ' @entity172 from @entity173 ' and refers to president @entity209 giving his ' @entity211 ' speech about @entity212 in 2003 @entity213 would have approved : @entity18 used many different memes and celebrities to bolster his campaign to have the snack adopted by @entity4 and @entity142 when he arrived he was shown and tasted his dream come to life - what became known as the @entity3			1
officials at @entity4 told him that they had been approached by @entity117 in 2010 with a proposal to combine their two brands			1
and @entity18 realized that he had written his letter six - months after @entity117 had come to @entity4 - removing any possibility of his idea having been appropriated			2
reacting to his death , @entity4 released a statement to say that @entity18 was a ' true friend of the @entity4 family ' and fondly remembered his 2012 visit as one of the first to try their greatest creation			2
one day : @entity18 helped to revolutionize the fast food landscape with his backing of the @entity3 the snack and the campaign : the @entity3 has sold more than 600 million units nationwide and was helped by @entity8 ' social media campaign that utilized people such as president @entity244 ' we are honored to have had his support through the @entity247 on @entity24 , and we admire his strength and optimism during his recent battle			1
our thoughts and sympathies are with @entity8 's family during this time , ' the company said in the statement			2
one of @entity257 's last @entity24 posts , commemorated the launch of his dream with a nachos - flavored taco shell on the bridge of an aircraft carrier with a banner reading , ' @entity211 ' behind it - in reference to president @entity209 's less successful attempt in 2003 to claim he had completed his task in @entity212			1
in one final comment to the @entity71 last year , @entity18 joked that although he was happy with the glory , ' if they wanted to send me a big taco check , that would be alright			0

@entity8 , 41 , hit upon the genius idea while watching television in 2009
approached @entity3 and @entity4 and was *re-buffed*
began a @entity24 campaign called ' @entity172 from @entity173 ' in 2010 to promote the snack
but in 2012 was told it had been already been invented but was invited to be one of the first to try the hybrid taco
the @entity3 brand has sold over 600 million units and turned around @entity4 's *fortunes* to the tune of $ 1 billion in sales
