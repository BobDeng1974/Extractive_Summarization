by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 04:22 est , 21 march 2013 @entity1 faces further humiliating downgrades to its credit rating after a lost decade that has seen the slowest economic recovery on record , the chancellor was warned tonight			1
in a blow to @entity12 ’s credibility , the @entity8 , the official @entity9 watchdog , today halved its growth forecasts for this year and warned that the plan to cut the deficit has stalled			1
official figures show real wages are due to fall by 2.4 per cent over the lifetime of this @entity19 – seized on by @entity20 as evidence that the @entity22 will leave people worse off at the next general election than they were in 2010			1
rival agency @entity40 has already stripped @entity1 of its gold - plated credit score			1
labour leader @entity43 taunted mr @entity12 for delivering ‘ a downgraded @entity44 from a downgraded chancellor ’			0
the @entity8 said that economic output will not return to its pre-crisis peak until early 2015 – marking seven lost years since the slump started in 2008			1
what comes in and what goes out : how the government will spend £ 108bn more than it receives in taxes this year by 2017 , the size of the economy will be 17 per cent smaller than it would have been if the economy had continued on the pre-crisis path			2
the watchdog said the @entity1 would avoid a triple - dip recession – but only just – with growth of 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2013 following the 0.3 per cent slump at the end of 2012			1
gloomy : the chancellor delivered his budget against a backdrop of economic turmoil but the @entity8 slashed its growth forecasts for the whole of 2013 from the 1.2 per cent it was expecting as recently as december to just 0.6 per cent			1
it also trimmed its 2014 forecast from 2 per cent to 1.8 per cent			0
@entity8 chief @entity70 said @entity1 is suffering a historically slow recovery			1
‘ what has been remarkable has been the slow pace of the recovery , ’ he said			0
the @entity74 warned that there was ‘ a roughly 50 - 50 chance ’ of a triple - dip but added that ‘ it remained probable that growth would pick up as the year wore on ’			1
the economic slump has hit tax receipts and exports remain sluggish , making it ever more difficult for the chancellor to balance the books			1
mr @entity12 has made tackling the deficit and reducing borrowing the centrepiece of the government ’s economic policy			2
the deficit fell from £ 159billion in 2009 - 10 under @entity20 to £ 121billion in 2011 - 12 as mr @entity12 ’s austerity measures were implemented			1
but the @entity8 said progress has stalled , with the government set to borrow £ 120.9billion this year and £ 119.8billion in 2013 - 14			1
and the chancellor is now set to borrow £ 434billion over the next five years – around £ 55billion more than expected at the time of the @entity95 in december			0
the national debt is on course to top £ 1.63trillion in 2017 - 18 – some £ 100billion more than expected in december and nearly double the £ 840billion black hole the @entity22 inherited in 2010			2
mr @entity12 was forced to admit that debt will not start falling as a percentage of national income until 2017 - 18			2
this is two years later than he planned			0
‘ it is taking longer than anyone hoped , ’ he admitted			0
graph showing gdp estimates and revisions from the last quarter of 2008 to the end of 2012 the chancellor has called for more public spending cuts in order to be able to say that borrowing has dropped this year compared with last year			0
mr @entity70 said borrowing will be ‘ essentially flat ’ for three years before starting to fall again in the run up to the election			0
the budget small print reveals how the sluggish economy is hitting ordinary families			0
official figures showed average wages grew by just 1.2 per cent in the past 12 months – less than half the 2.8 per cent rate of inflation – leaving millions of workers out of pocket			0
the @entity74 warned that inflation will remain stubbornly high for another three years as the squeeze on family finances intensified			0
mr @entity43 said : ‘ who is paying the price for the chancellor ’s failure ? @entity1 ’s families			2
’ in his first budget he predicted living standards would rise over the @entity19			0
’ @entity36 said it was ‘ examining the details of the budget ’ to assess the future of @entity1 ’s aaa rating while @entity37 launched a ‘ formal review ’ .			2

@entity8 halves growth prediction as @entity1 hovers above triple - dip recession
it blames fall in tax receipts for *inability* to cut deficit this year or in 2013/14
head of @entity8 warns revised figures do *n't* take into account @entity153 crisis
