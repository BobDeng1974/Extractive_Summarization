@entity1 's reign at @entity2 ended in defeat as @entity4 claimed a surprise 2 - 1 win			1
here @entity7 takes a look at what went wrong for the @entity10 during his first competitive game in charge of the @entity14 outfit			2
@entity2 need a plan c with @entity17 's favoured 3 - 5 - 2 system exposed in the first half and @entity2 trailing 1 - 0 at half - time , @entity2 reverted to a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 in the second - half in an attempt to liberate @entity22 down the flanks and @entity24 up front			1
for the first 20 minutes of the second half , the plan appeared to be working as @entity2 equalised through @entity24 and threatened to build up a head of steam			1
@entity4 's second goal killed the @entity2 momentum and @entity17 's team were unable to recover			1
in attack , it was too ponderous and too hesitant			2
@entity35 said on @entity36 : ' when we blitzed teams in the past , it was all about pace			2
today , it 's all nicey - nicey and taking too many touches			2
there is n't enough pace in the team			0
' @entity46 did not work , plan b ran out of steam			0
time for plan c - buy some high quality footballers			0
the philosophy can become irrelevant if the personnel is not up to scratch			0
admittedly hampered by the absences of @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity66 ended up at left - back and he was predictably caught out for the second goal			0
aside from the injuries , @entity2 desperately require at least one centre - half of elite - standing			1
@entity76 was faultless on his @entity78 debut but @entity79 did not always appear convincing in the defensive three while @entity81 was easily beaten by @entity82 for the second goal			1
@entity2 need a world - class centre back that can provide guidance and assurance to those around him			1
@entity89 's @entity88 remains a target but they should break the bank for @entity92 of @entity93			2
summer target : @entity2 have been linked with a move for @entity96 's @entity88 @entity22 remains the star for much of last season , @entity22 was the stand - out player for @entity2 and the only one who played without fear as the situation deteriorated under @entity102			1
the @entity103 - a little short of match fitness after returning late to pre-season following the @entity107 - began this game on the bench but replaced the injured @entity110 early on			2
immediately , @entity22 demonstrated his talent , committing opponents and sprinting down the right flank			0
one piece of footwork to sidestep @entity116 was breathtaking			0
he is the club 's most exciting and courageous player and @entity17 must find a way to fit him in			2
shining light : @entity22 was one of @entity2 's @entity17 said it will take time @entity1 admitted this summer that it takes time to transplant his ideas			1
at @entity126 , @entity17 's side were 7th after 13 matches in his first season , winning only five by the end of november			1
they did , however , go on to win the title			0
in one season at @entity134 , @entity17 's team were 10th after 14 games			1
again , they went on to win the title			0
at @entity138 , it took three seasons before @entity17 won his first @entity141 title			0
united fans may need to be patient with their new manager			0
buried : @entity4 midfielder @entity144 ( centre ) put @entity4 2 - 1 ahead with a left footed strike @entity17 will give the kids a chance perhaps forced upon him due to injuries , @entity1 started this match with six @entity151 in the starting line - up and nine in the match - day squad			1
nonetheless , we should not forget that players such as @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 started on the bench , as @entity110 and @entity76 were handed an opportunity			0
six of the 10 @entity164 players in the squad were homegrown in the @entity2 academy			1
it is now 3,701 consecutive first - team games that @entity2 have had an academy product in the match - day squad			1
the run stretches back to 1937			0
with @entity17 at the helm and @entity174 as assistant manager , that record should be protected			0
young gun : @entity76 was handed an opportunity to impress @entity17 at @entity14			0

@entity1 's side lost their opening game of the @entity78 season
