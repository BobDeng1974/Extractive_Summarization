in preparation the @entity8 have been increasing their recruitment drives like many other klan factions around the @entity10 ,			1
and unlike @entity0 members of the 20th century , members in 2014 use social media to attract new members and spread their views			1
university student and @entity149 for @entity151 @entity150 , 23 , was another of the six rally speakers			2

racist rocking : @entity150 plays the guitar and sings and plays bigoted white power songs while ( right ) the @entity0 sells cakes to make money for their cause she said : ' being around the @entity0 all their lives has given the boys good judgement			1
' it 's helping them face the situation here in @entity10			1
' we teach them to keep their klan activities a secret and in the home			0
' they are n't allowed to talk about it outside school unless they are with us at a rally like this			0
' the @entity0 is a @entity223 organization , so they get to read the bible and they enjoy going to rallies and they get to play with kids their own kind			1
' i was going to rallies when i was pregnant with both the boys , and they 've been gong to rallies since before they could crawl			0
' we did n't teach our kids that they could n't have @entity234 - @entity10 friends , but raising them in the @entity0 meant they chose the right way themselves			1
' they do n't choose to have black or @entity237 friends on their own			0
' terrifying : membership application for the @entity240 of @entity0 and the klan proper to attract newcomers the lower - ranking members of the @entity0 go on ' night rides ' where they litter small towns with the leaflets under cover of darkness			1
the night riders drive slowly through neighborhoods and throw leaflets in sandwich bags weighed down by grains of rice to stop them blowing away			0
some pamphlets they drop vary from neighborhood - watch - style flyers to mock @entity258 style ' your klan needs you ' posters			0
at the rally that follows , awards are presented to the foot soldiers who dropped the most leaflets or who had worked especially hard on recruitment			0
one member , a single dad named @entity269 in his 30s , who hides his identity with a black baseball cap and sunglasses , said : ' the night rides are good but i prefer to just speak to people			0
' i am permanently recruiting because that 's what we need - more members			1
' and we 're willing to try anything			0
even if i am in there supermarket , i start speaking to people and feel them out			0
good chance you 'll see them at our next rally			0
' the @entity8 themselves span at least three @entity10 states including @entity292 , @entity14 and @entity293			1
they are one of several @entity0 factions totalling up to 6,500 members across the @entity10			1
professor of criminal justice @entity298 , who has been working in and around the @entity0 since the 1970s , said : ' groups like the @entity0 sometimes choose to arm themselves because it 's a way of saying ' we mean business '			2
' the danger the @entity0 poses wo n't come in the form of a national army because their numbers are just too small			2
friends : @entity150 , @entity310 , @entity17 and @entity160 salute for the cameras in @entity14 ' the real danger is more likely to come from small splinter cells , sometimes with new leaders aiming to make a name for themselves			2
' the @entity0 is a shadow of it 's former self , which had far greater numbers			2
' but now , it 's like a cornered rat and they can be even more dangerous			0
' on april 13 , a former @entity0 faction leader , @entity321 , a.k.a @entity321 , was arrested and later charged after a rampage - style shooting at the @entity324 in @entity325			1
three people died in the shootings , including 14 - year - old @entity328 and his grandfather dr @entity329 , 69 , and a woman , @entity331 , 53			0
professor @entity298 added : ' they are becoming less culturally significant but this can lead to desperate acts in some extremist groups like the @entity0			2
' today the @entity0 is targeting younger people for two reasons			2
' they are traditionally made up of members from an older demographic , but young people help keep your organization alive			0
' they also give you a cultural boost in terms of modern approaches to recruitment and technology like the internet			0
