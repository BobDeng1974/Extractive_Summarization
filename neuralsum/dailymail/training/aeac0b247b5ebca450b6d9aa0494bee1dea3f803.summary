one of my former neighbours in my home town of @entity3 - on - @entity4 , @entity5 , was a widow whose son was a sailor in the merchant navy			2
he did not like to tell his mother when he would be coming home on leave because he was afraid she would worry if he was delayed on the way			2
but his mother always knew anyway — thanks to the family cat			2
this pet was very attached to this young man and , an hour or two before he arrived , it sat on the front door mat and began miaowing loudly as if equipped with some sixth sense which told it that he was on the way			2
@entity24 mutt : some animals seem to sense when their owners have had accidents or have died in distant places the cat was never wrong and this early - warning system gave our neighbour time to get her son ’s room ready and prepare him a meal in the certainty that he would turn up soon afterwards			1
this is just one of many examples of animals displaying the apparently psychic tendencies more normally associated with some of their human counterparts			1
many cats seem to know , for example , when they are going to the vet ’s — hiding away in the hope that their owners might get bored of looking for them and give up on the idea			2
more dramatically , some animals seem to sense when their owners have had accidents or have died in distant places — as documented on my database of more than 5,000 case histories involving psychic phenomena in animals			1
this includes 177 cases of dogs apparently responding to the death or suffering of their absent masters or mistresses , mostly by howling , whining or whimpering , and 62 accounts of cats showing similar signs of distress			2
conversely , in 32 instances people knew when their pet had died or was in dire need , even when they were many miles away at the time			2
as we will see , these paranormal powers are of potentially huge value to human beings in the prediction of natural disasters , such as earthquakes and tsunamis			1
and yet , as someone who has spent his entire adult life working as a biologist , holding senior academic posts both here and in the @entity86 , i am constantly surprised and frustrated by the refusal of my colleagues in the scientific world to take them seriously			2
in 50 per cent of dog - owning households and 30 per cent of those with cats , the animals were said to anticipate the arrival of a family member without acknowledging such phenomena , it ’s difficult to see how we can fully understand the behaviour of not just cats and dogs , but wild animals such as wolves			1
the latter were studied by naturalist @entity105 who , in 1919 , wrote a book that described the behaviour of a pack he had followed in @entity110			1
he found separated members of wolf packs remained in contact with each other and responded to each other ’s activities while many miles apart			2
on one occasion , a limping female became separated from the pack @entity105 was tracking and lay recovering in a den while the rest of the wolves moved on			2
days passed , then suddenly the female reappeared among the pack			2
the wolves ’ responsiveness appeared to involve far more than simply following habitual paths , tracking scent trails , or hearing howling or other sounds , and @entity105 wondered whether the same abilities might be found in pets			2
he described some simple experiments with a friend ’s dog which showed a knack for predicting its master ’s return home			0
the dog would go to stand at the door soon after its owner had started his journey from work			0
no one followed @entity105 ’s lead in researching this because , among scientists , the subject of telepathy has always been taboo			1
but in the @entity153 i began asking friends and neighbours if they had ever noticed that their animals could anticipate when someone was coming home			1
i soon received dozens of reports , and by 2011 my database included more than 1,000 accounts of dogs and more than 600 of cats behaving in this way			0
in telephone surveys in @entity166 and the @entity86 , i found that in about 50 per cent of dog - owning households and about 30 per cent of those with cats , the animals were said to anticipate the arrival of a member of the family			1
and it was not just dogs and cats that were involved			0
more than 20 other species showed similar behaviour , especially parrots and horses , but also a ferret , several bottle - fed lambs raised as pets , and pet geese			1
many cats seem to know , for example , when they are going to the vet 's - hiding away in the hope that their owners might get bored of looking for them many of those i spoke to made it clear that the animals ’ responses were not simply reactions to the sounds of familiar cars or footsteps in the street			1
they happened too long in advance of the person ’s arrival , and often even when they came home by bus or train			0
it was n’t just routine			0
some people were plumbers , lawyers and taxi drivers who worked irregular hours , but still their pets were ready to welcome them when they got home			0
intrigued by this , i carried out experiments			0
the most extensive were with a terrier called @entity218 , who lived near @entity220 with his owner @entity221			0
initial observations showed that he was at the window on 85 per cent of the occasions when @entity221 returned home			0
i wanted to be sure that this was not down to @entity228 learning @entity221 ’s routine , or picking up on other clues , so in a series of more formal tests , we arranged for @entity221 to be at least five miles away from home during each test			0
i then set up a camera to film @entity228 ’s behaviour and each day selected a random time for @entity221 to return home , asking her to travel by taxi so as to avoid any cues which might have come from the engine noise of a familiar car			1
she did not know in advance when she would go home , but was informed when to do so by a pager			0
on average , @entity228 was at the window only 4 per cent of the time during the main period of @entity221 ’s absence , and 55 per cent of the time when she was on the way back			0
i did similar experiments with other dogs , including a @entity254 from @entity220 called @entity255			0
he looked out of the window , with his paws on a front table , when his owner came home — but whereas @entity228 ’s vigil began shortly before his owner set off , @entity255 took up his post only when his mistress was already homeward bound			0
both these and the many other cases i have investigated suggest that these animals have some kind of telepathic bond with their owners			1
alongside telepathy , animals also seem to have a sense of impending doom			1
since classical times , people have reported unusual animal behaviour before earthquakes , and i have collected much modern evidence			1
in all these cases there were descriptions of wild and domesticated animals acting in fearful , anxious or unusual ways			1
some possible explanations are that they pick up vibrations in the earth ’s surface , or detect subterranean gases			0
the ability of animals to anticipate disasters have been ignored by @entity293 scientists ... but things are very different elsewhere or perhaps , as i am suggesting , animals rely on something which defies current scientific understanding			1
in the case of the @entity301 tsunami on december 26 , 2004 , they appeared to be aware that something was happening half an hour beforehand			0
according to villagers in @entity304 , @entity305 , a herd of buffalo were grazing by the beach when they suddenly lifted their heads and looked out to sea , ears standing upright			0
they turned and stampeded up the hill , followed by bewildered villagers , whose lives were thereby saved			1
some animals anticipate other kinds of natural disaster such as avalanches , and even man - made catastrophes			1
during @entity324 , many families relied on their pets ’ behaviour to warn them of air raids before official warnings were given			1
the animal reactions occurred when enemy planes were still hundreds of miles away , long before the animals could have heard them coming , and some dogs in @entity334 anticipated the explosion of @entity337 v - 2 rockets , even though these missiles were supersonic and could not have been heard in advance			1
with very few exceptions , the ability of animals to anticipate disasters has been ignored by @entity293 scientists , but things are very different elsewhere			1
since the @entity348 , in earthquake - prone areas of @entity347 , the authorities have encouraged people to report unusual animal behaviour			1
in several cases they have issued warnings that enabled cities to be evacuated hours before earthquakes struck , saving tens of thousands of lives			1
by paying attention to unusual animal behaviour , earthquake and tsunami warning systems might be feasible in parts of the world that are at risk from these disasters			1
millions of people could be asked to take part in this project			0
they could be told what kinds of behaviour animals might show if a disaster were imminent			1
if people noticed such behaviour , they would telephone a hotline			2
a computer system would analyse the places of origin of the messages			0
if there was an unusually large number , it would signal an alarm , and display on a map the places from which the calls were coming			0
exploring the potential for animal - based warning systems would cost relatively little			0
if it turns out that they are indeed reacting to subtle , physical changes , then seismologists should be able to use instruments to detect these and to make better predictions themselves			0
if , on the other hand , it turns out that what we call ‘ presentiment ’ plays a part , we should embrace it , regardless of whether or not we understand it			0
ignoring it , or trying to explain it away , will leave us less protected against the unexpected ravages of nature			0

ability of animals to seemingly anticipate disasters is ignored by @entity293 scientists
but could *monitoring* their behaviour help to save lives ?
