@entity53 said : ' my rule of thumb is @entity77			2
' i want people to restrict themselves to spending no more than it would cost in @entity77			2
' all i ’m asking is for people to be sensible , as this is public money at the end of the day			2
i encourage staff to think , if they could do it cheaper , then that ’s what they should do			2
' bumbling ' @entity4 ' boss @entity10 joined the trust in october 2010 and he rejected a salary of £ 190,000 , claiming it was ' too high ' - taking home a £ 170,000 salary instead			1

@entity53 said : ' there are lots of @entity7 organisations that use credit cards but we did n’t have credit cards in my last two organisations			0
i have never had a credit card and that is a moral position you take			0
' for some reason , a number of credit cards were approved for use by people			0
. most of them had pretty small amounts of money on them			0
in some cases , it was to do with purchasing around it			0
' people had been less than careful about the signing off			0
that has now been introduced			0
i just think too many had been issued			0
my advice is we do need to be careful about how this is perceived			0
' @entity53 said credit cards had been used in the past to make it ' quicker and easier ' for staff to purchase goods , including software for tablets and educational courses at external venues			0
he pointed out although credit cards had been used to pay restaurant bills , the cost was claimed back from professional bodies , such as the @entity191 , and did not come out of the @entity7 or trust budgets in ' many instances '			0
he said : ' it is not possible for me to comment on why my predecessor paid for certain items with a credit card			2
' what i am clear about , however , is my view that we should not be using credit cards unless it is absolutely necessary and we have taken steps to significantly reduce the number of cards the trust holds			0
' furthermore , when we are spending public money and using credit cards , we must take every step possible to ensure we are getting the best value for money			0
' our processes are far more robust now than they were previously			0
all chief executive spending is now countersigned by the chairman and chief finance officer			0
' mr @entity10 said his £ 190,000 proposed salary when he joined in october 2010 was too high and cut it by £ 20,000 , however he used his @entity7 credit card to eat in five star hotels and @entity100 star restaurants the trust said mr @entity10 has given assurance to auditors that his credit card was used for legitimate expenses			1
@entity10 was approached about the transactions but declined to comment			1
@entity227 , regional officer of trade union @entity228 , said he was alarmed by the amount of money spent on all the trust credit cards			2
he said : ' i think the amount spent on hospitality is ridiculous			2
' staff are struggling to pay their own bills when they go to the supermarkets and i ca n’t see them being happy about this			0
' mr @entity227 said reducing the amount of people holding trust credit cards was ' the right way forward '			0
@entity244 , from the @entity243 , said : ' this is a disgrace , and taxpayers will be outraged			0
' money does n’t grow on trees , and every penny frittered away on swanky meals and upmarket hotels is a penny that ca n’t be spent on doctors and nurses			1
' mr @entity10 - and the @entity7 officials who signed off the spending - have serious questions to answer			1
