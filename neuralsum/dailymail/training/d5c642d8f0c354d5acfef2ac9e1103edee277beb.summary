' for years , @entity39 courageously traveled throughout @entity7 collecting tens of thousands of signatures from ordinary @entity7 on a petition that came to be known as the @entity54 , which sought a peaceful democratic transition			2
all @entity39 wanted was a better future for @entity7 and the @entity7 people , and the @entity16 regime assassinated him for it , ' @entity3 said in a statement			1
' since her father ’s murder , ' @entity3 said , ' @entity37 has honored his legacy by continuing to advocate for a free and democratic @entity7 and also fighting to bring his murderers to justice			1
' @entity5 is taking @entity66 , the daughter of late @entity68 pilot @entity67 , as her guest			1

as part of the prisoner swap that freed @entity74 aid worker @entity73 - who is coming to tonight 's address as a guest of president @entity13 tonight - @entity13 commuted the sentence of one of the @entity7 spies @entity5 said today ' was one of the co-conspirators ' in the plot to shoot down @entity66 's father 's plane			1

following @entity7 's release of 53 political prisoners whose freedom the @entity74 demanded , @entity13 last week issued a memorandum easing restrictions on travel to the country			2

and @entity74 who do travel to @entity7 will now be able to bring back $ 100 of alcohol and cigars			0

free elections ' and a multi-party system of governing			0
but the deal negotiated by the @entity13 administration ' is not gon na get us there , ' she said			0
' it 's a good deal for @entity74 tourists , maybe , who want cheaper rum and cheaper cigars , and maybe that 's what 's driving this conversation , ' she said			0
' but i think it 's about freedom , it 's about respect for human rights , and the president is not going to help the @entity7 people get there			0
' ' we 've given away the store , and i do n't think the @entity7 people are going to be any freer today or tomorrow with this very weak @entity7 deal , ' @entity5 told him			0
the @entity7 military runs the tourist bureau there , she explained , so the @entity74 is just ' feeding the monster that then oppresses the people ' when it encourages unrestricted trade and travel with the country			0

' the @entity1 senator , whose parents were @entity7 immigrants , said he hoped @entity37 presence at the @entity9 would ' at least remind [ @entity13 ] that her father ’s murderers have not been brought to justice , and that the @entity74 is now , in fact , sitting at the table with them			0
