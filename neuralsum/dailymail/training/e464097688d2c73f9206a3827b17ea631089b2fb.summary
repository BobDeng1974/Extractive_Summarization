while he still is n't exactly clear - eyed , @entity4 looked much better and joked at the show 's opening that he was ' sitting in ' for @entity12 and @entity13 , who had subbed for him during a six - day absence			1
he thanked the two , and viewers for expressing concern			2
' my apologies to everyone for the unavoidable but uncomfortable circumstance of a broadcaster 's ill - timed affliction getting in the way , even for just a moment , from what we all came here for , ' @entity4 said			1
he 's back : @entity7 's @entity4 was back anchoring again in @entity27 , @entity28 , on monday , pictured hours before his return , he told @entity0 that his infection has to run its course of 2 - 3 weeks , the entire @entity32			1
' it 's the all - time perfect bad timing , but what can you do ? it 's a curve ball and you 've got to go with it , ' @entity4 chuckled during an interview , ' even though i could n't spot the rotation on a curve ball right now			1
' the broadcaster who began his @entity32 work as a late - night host at the 1988 @entity45 looked relaxed at the @entity7 compound in a navy polo shirt and cardigan sweater			1
traces of his bout with viral conjunctivitis were still visible - the infection began in his left eye and spread quickly to the right - and both are still reddened			0
' i 'm better than i was , ' he said , ' but not as good as i 'd like to be			0
' @entity4 nursed a cup of coffee and propped his feet up on the desk as he discussed his unwanted week off			2
he rated himself a 2 on a scale of 1 - 10			0
at one point , he thought there was about a 10 percent chance he would n't make it back for the games			0
pink eye : @entity4 , pictured sunday , was off the air for a week with an eye infection @entity4 interviewed president @entity67 on february 6 , the night before the opening ceremonies			2
he awakened the next morning ' and my left eye was like a slit , and i 'm thinking , " what the hell ? " ' @entity4 recalled			0
' but i 'm also thinking maybe i put a few eye drops in and it resolves itself			0
but as soon as the doctor got a look at it , he realized something was wrong			0
' @entity4 worked that night trying to cover up the redness by wearing glasses that made him look like a hipster			2
drawing barbs from tv critics and snickers on social media , he finally sidelined himself after five nights of @entity32 coverage when his blurred vision and sensitivity to light made working impossible			2
' when something out of the ordinary happens , like with my eyes , you know ( the attention is ) coming , but again , the degree of attention to it makes me uncomfortable			0
not because i do n't understand it , ' he said , ' but because that is n't the story that we came here expecting to talk about			0
' so what i tried to do the first few nights - when i thought it was only going to be a few nights - is kiss it off with a candid line and move on and not dwell on it			0
but when it got to the point where i could n't be on the air , ' @entity4 added , ' you could n't expect that people would ignore that			2
' worst of it : @entity4 , pictured in the midst of the infection , tried to cover up the redness by wearing glasses but he finally sidelined himself when his blurred vision and sensitivity to light made working impossible current today show host @entity12 and former co-anchor @entity13 subbed for @entity4			1
it was the first time anyone except @entity4 had been the host of an @entity32 primetime telecast on any @entity127 network since 1998			1
@entity4 said he spent three days in a darkened hotel room awake at odd hours			1
the chance to watch the @entity7 feed kept him current , but also gave him a different perspective on the coverage			2
' when they did the hookup , it really did n't matter when i slept - from noon to 8 , or midnight to 8 in the morning			0
generally , i was awake at 5 ( a.m. , @entity27 time ) so i watched a good portion of prime - time every night			1
... i experienced it something closer to the way someone in the @entity145 would , except it was dawn when i was doing it , ' he added , ' and it was a little blurry			0
' @entity4 also said he the chance to watch some of the network 's cable coverage of events in real time , and thought about whether that would influence his own presentation			1
' my @entity32 road is closer to its end than its beginning , ' he said			0
' by the time i can foresee prime - time changing radically , somebody else will be doing it			1

while he still is n't exactly clear - eyed , @entity7 's prime - time @entity32 host looked much better as he returned to the network 's coverage monday night
he joked at the show 's opening that he was ' sitting in ' for @entity12 and @entity13 , who had subbed for him during a six - day absence
