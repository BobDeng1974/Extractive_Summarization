by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 18:21 est , 29 august 2012 the number of deaths due to heroin dropped by a quarter last year , it emerged yesterday			1
the @entity4 said there are now indicators @entity7 has fewer hard drug users			1
there were 596 deaths , which doctors and inquests said were due to heroin or morphine overdoses , in 2011 compared to 791 in 2010 and nearly 900 in 2008			2
drug - related deaths : while deaths caused by heroin dropped substantially since supplies dried up , deaths caused by methadone , the legal substitute , have risen the fall was caused by a ‘ heroin drought ’ as supplies dried up on the street making it more difficult for addicts to buy and more harder to find heroin of high purity on sale from dealers			1
fewer heroin users died despite the fears of drug abuse workers and campaigners that the shortage would mean more fatalities among addicts whose tolerance level for the drug fell in the longer period between hits , the @entity4 said			2
it said : ‘ evidence suggests that from october 2010 there has been a heroin drought in the @entity7			1
’ the figures indicate that the country has fewer hard drug users and a falling demand for heroin			0
the @entity4 also said that deaths caused by cocaine - a drug that has become increasingly widespread in @entity7 over the past decade - have dropped to their lowest level since 2008			1
the falling numbers of deaths from hard drugs came in a week when new scientific evidence that cannabis can harm the development of teenagers was published			0
drop in deaths : cocaine deaths dropped to 112 , fewer than half the 235 recorded in 2008 the findings are thought likely to push down still further the declining numbers of young people using the drug once claimed to be entirely safe by supporters of decriminalisation			0
but the @entity4 figures had one bleak spot			0
there were more deaths among users of methadone , the legal heroin substitute prescribed to heroin users which is designed to avoid withdrawal symptoms while not giving the same ‘ high ’			1
methadone deaths rose from 355 in 2010 to 486 in 2011			0
there were 596 deaths which doctors and inquests said were due to heroin or morphine overdoses in 2011 compared to 791 in 2010 and nearly 900 in 2008			2
cocaine deaths dropped to 112 , down from 144 in 2010 , and fewer than half the 235 recorded in 2008			0
the @entity4 said : ‘ evidence suggests that from october 2010 there has been a ‘ heroin drought ’ in the @entity7 , with shortages in the availability of heroin continuing in some areas in 2011/12			1
‘ this heroin drought has resulted in typical street heroin purity falling from 46 per cent in september 2009 to around 32 per cent in september 2010 , and down again to 19 per cent in july to september 2011			2
' drugs workers were concerned that the heroin drought may result in more drug - related deaths , as users who had developed a reduced tolerance could overdose if they used a high quality batch of heroin			1
’ but the report said : ‘ ons data show the opposite trend with deaths involving heroin falling in recent years			0
‘ there was a significant decline in the proportion of 16 to 59 - year - olds reporting use of heroin between 2009/10 and 2010/11			0
' moreover , the number of adults newly entering treatment for heroin and crack use has fallen by 15 per cent in two years			0
’ the @entity4 said the decline is ‘ probably due to reduced demand ' .			2

number of deaths caused by heroin dropped by a quarter last year
@entity4 says high rate could be due to a heroin drought in the @entity7
deaths caused by methadone , the legal substitute to heroin , have risen
