by @entity1 reporter published : 14:14 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 19 august 2013 the bus - sized meteor that slammed into @entity4 in february , injuring more than 1,000 people , setting off car alarms and shattering windows sent a plume of cosmic dust into the stratosphere that showered the @entity11 for three months			1
according to @entity15 's @entity14 weather satellite , the meteor left behind hundreds of tons of microscopic rubble when it detonated 15 miles above the city of @entity20 on february 15			1
some six months later , using the satellite 's @entity21 , the space agency has released a video showing how the dust from the meteor , which also left visible chunks on the ground for passers by to pick up , was thrown up 28 miles and coated the @entity11			1
that represents far less material than is ejected by an erupting volcano , but it still got dragged around by the circulating atmosphere			0
after four days , the @entity14 sensors had watched that dust plume wrap all the way around the planet			2
eventually , it smeared into a single , 250 mile wide belt at an altitude of roughly 22 miles			0
the satellite watched it sit there there for months , slowly settling downward about 295 feet each day			0
terrifying : almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the @entity11 's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000 mph friction : burning from the friction with @entity11 's thin air , the space rock exploded 14.5 miles above the @entity4 town of @entity20 it was @entity70 atmospheric physicist @entity69 who came up with the idea to to track the cloud using the incredible satellite			1
' indeed , we saw the formation of a new dust belt in @entity11 's stratosphere , and achieved the first space - based observation of the long - term evolution of a bolide plume , ' @entity69 , a @entity20 native , said , according to @entity82			1
' initial measurements 3.5 hours after the meteor explosion showed the dust 25 miles high in the atmosphere , speeding east at 190 mph			2
' and within days the plume had ' circumnavigated the entire globe and returned to @entity20 , creating a complete global belt			2
' wake - up call : experts said asteroid 2012 @entity92 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system damage : if an early warning system existed countries could prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris @entity99 only takes snapshots of the belt as it passes by so researchers simulated the dust using a pair of atmospheric models			0
one model is used specifically for ash plumes from volcanic eruptions , and the other captures aerosols			0
almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the @entity11 's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000 mph , blowing out the windows of 900 schools and hospitals and damaging around 100,000 homes			1
the debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash .			0
