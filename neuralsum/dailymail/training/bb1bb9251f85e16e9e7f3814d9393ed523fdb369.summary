a court heard he then dropped his kids off at his sister ’s and arrived at work five minutes late , but told them he felt ill and went home			2
he later went on to the internet to check if there were any automatic traffic surveillance systems on the road and took no steps to notify the police about the collision			2
at home with the dog : @entity7 in @entity23 , in the mid- 1990s , while in her mid-to - late 60s @entity8 , of @entity23 , was due to face trial this september but changed his plea and admitted causing mrs @entity7 ’s death by careless driving			1

i was expecting a much longer sentence			2
the man drove off and then lied about what he ’d done			2
‘ he was obviously guilty because innocent people do n’t flee the scene			2
when they caught him he told lies , he denied he had been at the scene			0
‘ he said the wing mirror had been stolen a few weeks before			0
‘ i just feel that justice has n’t been done			0
what worth is a human life ? an old lady going about her business was run down and he did n’t stop at all			0
‘ he will be out in three months			2
and he only got a two year driving ban and he will be back on the roads			0
‘ it ’s disgusting , the law needs to be changed			0
if you shoot somebody they take the gun off you and you do n’t get it back			0
‘ a car is as lethal as a gun , but you run somebody down and you get it back in two years			0
’ retired social worker mr @entity39 also told how @entity8 changed his plea several times , dragging the court process out for almost two years			1
he added : ‘ he pleaded guilty initially and then he wanted to vacate his plea			0
because of that we were in court a number of times so it dragged it out			0
‘ it was going to go to trial in february but was put back to june			0
then it was put back to september and it was only a few weeks ago that he changed his plea			0
‘ i do n’t know why he did it but i can only presume he saw the pathologist report and knew the game was up			0
‘ i had to go off with stress for four months			2
i went back to work afterwards but i just could n’t concentrate and went off again on long - term leave			2
i then took voluntary redundancy			0
’ prosecutor @entity126 told the court an eyewitness described @entity8 ’s black @entity47 ‘ screaming round the bend towards me ’			1
mr @entity126 added : ‘ it ’s plain she had entered the crossing when the defendant ’s vehicle , travelling in the @entity79 direction , was in collision with her			2
’ @entity8 was arrested and later admitted he was the driver , but told police he was unaware he had struck a person and thought it was an animal			1
defending him in court , @entity140 said : ‘ he simply did n’t see mrs @entity7			1
’ mr @entity39 , who is single and has no children , is now writing to his mp , @entity144 , in a bid to get the sentencing rules in cases of causing death by careless driving tightened up			1
and he said his mother , who was widowed twice , had been a bright and active woman who walked a mile and a quarter every day and was a member of her local gym			0
mr @entity39 added : ‘ we would meet up in @entity79 for a coffee and a panini and she would catch the bus in			1
‘ she was also a keen gardener and enjoyed doing cryptic crosswords			0
it was harrowing to see her deteriorate in hospital			0
‘ had she lived , she would have needed 24 - hour care			0
it was heart - rending			0
’ mrs @entity7 worked as a museum guide and at the @entity165 , but was retired at the time of the horror smash			1
