they include types of ingredients , rations of ingredients , color , feel , and more science has cracked the code of the nacho cheese @entity5 ’s ability to keep us coming back for more			1
ingredients , fat ratio , texture , and even the brightly colored bags all combine to make @entity5 one of the most popular snack chip in existence			1
while a little sneaky , none of the tricks that make @entity5 king make the chip any less irresistible			1
in fact , @entity28 , who invented @entity5 in 1964 , spent much of his life adoring his brainchild			2
when he died in 2011 , his family honored his contribution by tossing the chips into his grave as it was lowered into the ground			1
‘ he would think it is hilarious , ’ said his daughter @entity38			0
it takes the perfect texture to give @entity5 so much allure , food scientist @entity40 told the @entity44			2
@entity5 uses a perfect ratio of fat to deliver its delectable punch : a full 50 percent of their calories come from fat			2
this helps boost flavor while also creating a sensation of the @entity5 melting in your mouth			2
this sensation fools your body and brain into believing less has been consumed			0
the phenomenon is called vanishing caloric density and can also be found in popcorn , cheese puffs , and cotton candy			0

garlic powder helps add to the bold @entity5 taste , as does three different forms of salt			1
three other flavor enhancing chemicals are present , as well : monosodium glutamate , disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate			0
these additives help create a burst of intensely savory flavor			0
@entity113 : the tangy @entity5 taste helped make @entity116 's @entity115 into one the chain 's most successful products ever citric and lactic acids also keep snackers snacking by encouraging salivation , which according to dr. @entity40 and the @entity44 , stimulates the impulse to eat			2
when all of the @entity5 ’s flavors come together , something magical occurs : not a single ingredient ’s flavor stands out			0
with all its ingredients balanced so perfectly , the chip avoids so - called sensory specific satiety — that is , the urge to stop eating after you become sick of the same flavor			0
the @entity5 ’s bright bags and colorful coating are the final factors that make @entity28 ’s chip a favorite for life			1
