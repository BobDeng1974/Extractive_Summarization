looted treasure : this gold - plated bronze figurine was stolen from a museum in @entity3 , western @entity4 militants fighting for the @entity6 in @entity4 are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men			1
looted from ancient buildings in @entity16 strongholds , such as the group 's de facto capital city @entity19 , the antiquities are up to 10,000 - years - old and can exchange hands for more than $ 1 million each			1
the most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy @entity23 - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects , which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring @entity30 and @entity31			1
the trade in antiquities is one of @entity16 ' primary sources of funding , along with oil and ransom payments , and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year			0
the finer points of @entity16 trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the @entity43			0
it revealed that @entity16 militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control			1
if the smugglers decide not to buy the items , they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry , regardless of their historic significance			0
the primary trade routes out of @entity4 are through neighbouring @entity31 and @entity30 , with the homes and private museums owned by wealthy @entity23 the eventual destination			1
one 21 - year - old smuggler originally from the @entity4 capital @entity63 but now plying his trade in @entity65 says the usual method of getting the items over the border is simply to pay a taxi driver already well known to the border guards to carry it in his boot			1
calling himself ' @entity75 ' , the smuggler says his group do their best to make money selling ancient items such as earrings , rings , small statues and stone heads that were stolen from one of @entity4 's many looted museums , most of them in and around @entity86			1
however his three - man outfit are positively small time compared to the large organised crime groups dealing with antiquities worth millions of pounds			0
these groups have the financial clout and connections to smuggle their items to @entity23 without arousing the suspicions of the authorities who mete out severe punishments to smugglers			2
security : a @entity4 police officer patrols the ancient of @entity103 to protect its ruins from looters and smugglers once the antiquities are outside @entity4 , they are generally passed on to middle men with connections to art collectors , usually in @entity23 of @entity110 such as @entity111 or @entity112			1
@entity113 , a @entity4 operating as a go - between in southern @entity31 , claims to have recently sold a single item for $ 1.1 million			2
' it was a piece from the year @entity118 , ' he told the @entity43			0
the middle men usually agree prices with dealers who observe the stolen items on @entity124 or by photographs sent online			1
in another sign of the organised criminal element behind the trade , the dealers then send their own teams to inspect and collect the items before the money is paid			0
the dealers are then able to use their contacts among wealthy art lovers to ensure the ancient items are found a new home , many of them private collections and secret museums of @entity23			1
less valuable items - often still over 1,000 years old - typically find their way in to the back rooms of tourist shops in @entity65 and southern @entity31 , where those in the know ask to see what 's on offer			2
smuggling the products out of the country is the purchasers responsibility however , and the choice is between paying extortionate fees to have the items posted to an anonymous address in the @entity156 , or otherwise risk imprisonment by carrying the items on to planes and buses on their person			0
making them rich : the trade in antiquities is one of @entity16 ' primary sources of funding , along with oil and ransom payments , and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year @entity16 is believed to generate a total of several million pounds a day , with approximately £ 400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil			2
a further £ 250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control , while @entity16 also makes money from farming , water services and electricity production			0
revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate , but the price for release is usually millions of pounds			0
companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under @entity16 ' control - with lorries charged £ 500 per journey , plus a further £ 250 tax for electronic good and £ 200 for food parcels			0
however one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command			0
for example , one @entity213 intelligence official claimed that @entity16 earned £ 23 million in early 2014 alone by selling 800 items stolen from the ancient city of @entity217 near @entity63 .			2

@entity16 are selling 10,000 - year - old antiques for as much as $ 1 million each
militants charge smugglers 20 per cent tax for items they would otherwise destroy as *symbols* of idolatry
smugglers use taxis to *sneak* items from @entity4 into @entity30 and @entity31
once there , middle men use @entity124 to **display** the looted items to dealers
dealers are then able to sell the ancient objects to art collectors in @entity23 and the @entity110 , who **display** them in secret museums
