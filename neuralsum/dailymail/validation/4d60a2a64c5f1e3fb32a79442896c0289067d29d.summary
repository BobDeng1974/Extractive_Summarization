playtime : a couple of thick - skinned surfers in @entity2 were caught on camera as they went head to head with the local pros ; sea lions dressed for the weather : the two unidentified men were spotted of the rocky coast of @entity9 in @entity10 as they paddled alongside the large creatures in near freezing conditions catch me if you can : in one shot a surfer leads the way as the seals trail behind him and in another the animals inquisitively watch as the humans pass them by picture pro : the unusual scene was captured by 55 - year - old @entity21 photographer , @entity20 career high : the cameraman says in @entity2 he sees a lot of wildlife , but spotting the sea lions was ' extra special ' but it was only when he ’d zoomed in on his camera that he noticed the unlikely panel of spectators bobbing in the water			1
incredibly , the sea lions seemed to enjoy the show so much that they stayed nearly two hours but decided to keep their distance			2
recalling the incident @entity20 said : ' when i got there the surfers and sea lions were already there			1
' the sea lions repeatedly stuck their heads or large part of their body out of the water to watch these surfers and what they were doing			2
' i have observed surfers at this location many times before but never with this amount of sea lions and around and i ’ve never seen them this curious			0
' i think the surfers were trying to ignore the sea lions but we were also just careful that they did not come too close			0
' the sea lions did n’t interact with the surfers from what i saw , they can get quite territorial so that could potentially not be a good thing			0
' here in @entity2 we see a lot of wildlife , which is one of the reasons i love living here , so it ’s not a surprise to see sea lions , however , these were extra special			0
