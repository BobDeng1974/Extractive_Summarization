refusing to give up : naked rambler @entity0 , 54 , has lost his case in @entity4 's human rights court human rights judges have told @entity7 's best - known naturist he can not avoid arrest for walking in the nude			1
' @entity0 ' @entity0 has spent more than five years in jails and police cells for refusing to wear clothes - and insisted his treatment by police violated his fundamental rights			1
the 54 - year - old was repeatedly jailed for contempt of court after bringing his naturism into the dock , then was isolated in prison because he was naked there too			0
he brought his case to the @entity21 in @entity22 , saying police and prison officers had violated his rights to free expression and a private life			1
today the court ruled in favour of the government in both cases , saying that while the case was ' troubling ' mr @entity0 had ' full knowledge of the consequences ' when he set off on his naked treks			1
it added his behaviour ' goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society ' and was ' alarming and morally offensive '			1
mr @entity0 , a former marine , has walked naked from @entity42 to @entity43 and is a well - known campaigner for his right to appear nude in public			1
but his actions have repeatedly landed him in prison			0
he spent a total of five years and three months in detention from may 2006 to july 2011 , when his arrests for breaching the peace sparked the human rights appeal			2
today 's ruling , led by @entity57 human rights court president @entity55 , is the culmination of a long legal battle with the authorities by mr @entity0 - who has repeatedly refused to back down			1
mr @entity0 today described the judgment as ' a disappointment ' but added : ' i have no choice but to continue			1
' he did win 3,000 euros ( £ 2,360 ) in damages for ' distress as a result of the physical conditions of his detention ' , but this was substantially less than the 195,000 euros ( £ 154,000 ) he demanded			2
mr @entity0 - who was in detention almost constantly between 2006 and 2011 - said : ' how can nature expressed in human form be indecent ? how can any sane person be offended at seeing the human body ? ' @entity77 : even in prison , mr @entity0 was often segregated because he did not accept guards ' offer of clothing hard fighter : mr @entity0 did win £ 2,360 in damages , but this was less than the £ 154,000 he had asked for the ruling read : ' the applicant ’s imprisonment is the consequence of his repeated violation of the criminal law in full knowledge of the consequences			1
' [ this was ] through conduct which he knew full well not only goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society , but also is liable to be alarming and morally and otherwise offensive to other , unwarned members of the public going about their ordinary business			1
. the court described @entity0 ’s case as ' troubling ' but ruled that ' relevant and sufficient ' measures had been taken against him by the police and legal authorities			1
they were meeting a ' pressing social need in response to repeated anti-social conduct ' by @entity0 , the ruling added			0
there was no violation of his freedom of expression , the judges ruled , and he was not afforded the right to a ' private life ' because his nudity was a public protest			1
in trouble again : the case was finally sparked by his treatment at @entity123 in july 2011 ( left ) after years of public notoriety , which included walking to @entity43 with his girlfriend @entity125 in 2003 judges said his behaviour ' goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern society ' they wrote : ' the applicant , by deliberately and consistently appearing naked in very public places such as urban centres , courtrooms and the communal parts of prisons , was intent on making a public statement of his belief in the inoffensive nature of the human body			2
' even though , cumulatively , the penalties imposed on the applicant undoubtedly did entail serious consequences for him , the court can not find in the circumstances of his case , having regard in particular to his own responsibility for his plight , that the public authorities in @entity151 unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression			2
' on one occasion in 2009 court officials hastily erected a screen around mr @entity0 's privates to prevent him being in contempt of court			0
two years later he walked out of @entity160 naked after a jail term , and was approached by police within minutes - but still refused to put on his clothes			0
he appeared naked once again in court as he pleaded not guilty to breaching the peace - rejecting the sheriff ’s warnings that he would be held in contempt again if he did not put some clothes on			0
the @entity151 courts found @entity0 ’s conduct on that occasion was severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people , threatened serious disturbance to the community , and presented as genuinely alarming in its context to any reasonable person			2
he was jailed to 330 days for the breach of the peace and 90 days for contempt , together with 237 days unspent from a previous sentence - landing him a total jail term of one year , nine months and 18 days			0
mr @entity0 said today : ' i expected them to take the wider view			0
' then again , what great endeavour ever succeeded without having to surmount many obstacles that stood in its way ? why should it be any different for me ? i have no choice but to continue			0
' not saying goodbye : mr @entity0 , pictured , has vowed to continue his naked quest despite the ruiling he added : ' how can nature expressed in human form be indecent ? how can any sane person be offended at seeing the human body ? ' intolerance and ignorance go together , in the same way that freedom and truth do			2
we can not be intolerant and free			0
we can not ignore the truth and expect justice to be the outcome			0
and an unjust world affects us all , whether we are aware of it or not			0
' i was brought up to believe i lived in a country that celebrated eccentricity and difference , not only because it added variety and colour to the otherwise slavish conformity that can feel depressive , constricting and sometimes just downright boring , but that it also indicated a deeper appreciation of how the unorthodox , at its very essence , is how originality and creative energy manifests itself			0

*ex-marine* @entity0 , 54 , has spent more than five years in cells
he *challenged* string of arrests in the @entity21
but @entity22 ruled today he had ' full knowledge of the consequences '
case ' troubling ' but his right to free expression not violated , judges said
they ruled his walks in the nude were ' alarming and morally offensive '
he did however win £ 2,300 damages - and vowed to continue his habit
