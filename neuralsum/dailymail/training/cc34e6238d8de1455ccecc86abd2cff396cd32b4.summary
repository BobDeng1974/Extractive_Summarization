she had become another victim of a mysterious spate of deaths in the tropical rainforest			0
if wildlife officials had not led the three - month - old infant to safety , it would probably have remained beside its mother until it , too , died			1
' great loss ' : a three - month - old elephant calf attempts to wake its mother ; one of ten pygmy elephants found dead in @entity23 's @entity22 state its distress moved the rescuers to tears , and left them desperate to discover who or what caused the tragedy			1
