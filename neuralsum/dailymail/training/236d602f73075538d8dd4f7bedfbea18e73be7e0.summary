colours may be the same around the world , but the language in which they are described can have a significant impact on how they are perceived			2
in @entity6 , the most popular base colours are blue , pink and green , while in @entity8 red , blue and green are more prominent			1
a data scientist wanted to put this theory to the test and , in doing so , has created a graphic that reveals how few ways there are in certain @entity16 cultures to talk about colours , compared to the @entity18			2
language lessons : on the left , you can see the number of @entity6 names for colour hues , and the right shows how there are much fewer names for colours in @entity8			1
in @entity6 , the most popular base colours are blue , pink and green , while in @entity8 red , blue and green are more prominent @entity29 from @entity30 designed the infographic to show the range of names for colours and hues on @entity36 , in @entity6 and then in @entity8			1
his method is biased as there are more @entity36 users that are @entity6 speakers , but it does reveal the importance of certain colours in both languages			1
in @entity8 , most popular base colours are 紅 ( red ) , 藍 ( blue ) and @entity46			1
colours can also relate to objects like salmon , stone and pine tree			1
this may be telling as red in @entity8 cultures symbolises good fortune and joy			1
it remains a popular colour in the country and is affiliated with the current government			2
this graphic shows the number of different words for each colour shade in @entity8			1
one of the most popular colours is red , which symbolises good fortune and joy in @entity8 culture there are far more words for blue and green in @entity6 than there are in @entity8			1
' i was fascinated by the urban legend that @entity76 has 50 words for snow , and the idea that a culture will develop a richer vocabulary for things it cares , ' said mr @entity29 on @entity84 by comparison , popular @entity6 colours are blue , green and pink , with some colours based on objects			1

mr @entity29 's graphic highlights the debate over whether speaking a certain language allows people to ' see ' more colours , because they have more descriptions			2
a number of studies seem to suggest this may be the case			0
the left image shows the use of light colours in @entity6 , and the right image shows its use in @entity8			1
mr @entity29 's graphic highlights the debate over whether speaking a certain language allows people to ' see ' more colours , because they have more descriptions a 1954 study found that @entity119 speakers , a tribe of @entity121 , found they do not differentiate between orange and yellow			2
as a result , they have trouble telling them apart			0
a separate study focused on how @entity129 speakers have separate words for light blue ( goluboy ) and dark blue ( siniy )			2
@entity133 recruited 50 people from the @entity136 area in @entity137 , half of whom were native @entity129 speakers			0
they found they were 10 per cent faster at distinguishing between light ( goluboy ) blues and dark ( siniy ) blues than at discriminating between blues within the same shade category			0
the @entity146 has devised a training programme to see if adults without synaesthesia can develop the key hallmarks of the condition @entity152 , including singers @entity153 and @entity155 , report an overlap in their senses ; they see smells , taste colours or feel sounds			0
the neurological condition , which can affect as many as one in 23 people , has long been linked with creativity			0
and now scientists believe the condition correlates to an increase in intelligence - and they claim people can even be taught to experience it			0
the @entity146 has devised a nine - week training programme to see if adults without synaesthesia can develop the key hallmarks of the condition			0
they found , in a sample study of 14 , that the participants were able to develop strong letter - colour associations to pass all the standard tests for synaesthesia			0
most experienced sensations such as letters seeming ' coloured ' or having individual personas , for instance , ' x is boring ' , ' w is calm '			0
one of the most surprising outcomes of the study was that those who underwent the training also saw their iq jump by an average of 12 points , compared to a control group that did n't undergo training .			0
