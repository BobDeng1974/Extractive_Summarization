‘ although it is rare , in any situation where we feel that a patients ’ privacy may have been compromised we will not hesitate to act , and will take immediate steps to help ensure that a similar event could not happen again			0
‘ i have personally asked all five of our directorates ( medicine , women and children ’s , regional services , clinical services and surgery , critical care and anaesthetics ) to review every clinical area they are responsible for , in order to ensure that the privacy and dignity of every patient we treat is protected at all times			1
