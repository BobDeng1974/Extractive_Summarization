by @entity0 for @entity1 a married @entity3 man has been ordered to pay a woman £ 3,000 compensation for ' violating her right to virginity ' because he pretended to be single when they slept together			1
the man , identified only by his surname @entity10 , was fined and told he will have to write his younger lover an apology letter during sentencing at @entity14 in @entity15 yesterday			1
the couple first met online five years ago but did not begin a relationship until september last year , at which @entity10 told the woman - whose surname was given as @entity21 - that he was a bachelor			0
violated : the man , identified only by his surname @entity10 , was fined and told he will have to write his younger lover an apology letter during sentencing at @entity14 ( pictured ) in @entity15 yesterday the court rejected @entity10 's claim that the couple had not had a sexual relationship and found him guilty of taking @entity21 's virginity by deception			1
@entity21 met @entity10 on an online forum several years ago , but the couple only started dating last september - at which point @entity10 insisted he was not already in a relationship , according to the @entity35			0
the couple had sex for the first time during a visit to @entity40 later in the year , but @entity10 broke off the relationship shortly after they returned to @entity3 and refused to respond to any of @entity21 's repeated attempts to speak with him			2
frustrated by the lack of contact , @entity21 broke into @entity10 's apartment in @entity15 in february this year - where she was shocked to discover he was living with wife of several years			1
a month later she filed a lawsuit alleging @entity50 had ' violated her virginity by deception ' and demanding he pay her £ 50,000 in compensation as well as write her a letter of apology			2
deception : there have been several similar cases of men being ordered to pay compensation for breaching the virginity or chastity ' rights ' of women in @entity3			0
while some are purely symbolic , others result in heavy fines the @entity14 agreed that virginity was a civil right that must be protected , adding that having sex with @entity10 had negatively impacted on @entity21 's health and reputation , but ruling that a written apology and a reduced compensation package of £ 3,000 is the correct punishment			1
it is the first time a case arguing sexual ' rights ' has been upheld in a court in @entity15 - although there was previously a similar successful trial in @entity83 province			0
in that instant a married man who told a woman he was single before having a one night stand with her was ordered to pay symbolic compensation of 1 yuan - roughly 10p - becuase he had violated her ' right to chastity '			2
he was also ordered to make a written apology			0
compensation for a breach of ' chastity rights ' has also been ordered in @entity96 and @entity97 provinces , but only when the victims were virgins .			0
