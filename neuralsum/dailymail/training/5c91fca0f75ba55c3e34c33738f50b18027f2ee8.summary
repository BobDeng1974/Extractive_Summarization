@entity0 insists @entity1 silenced his critics by inspiring @entity4 's fightback against @entity5			1
former @entity6 and @entity8 star @entity7 has been the most outspoken in questioning why @entity1 's development has stalled since making his debut in 2008			1
the 22 - year - old issued the perfect response against the @entity14 champions , reacting to @entity16 's opener by lobbing @entity17 before teeing up a sublime volley for @entity19			1
@entity1 has silenced his critics according to @entity4 manager @entity0 @entity21 ' late header salvaged a 2 - 2 draw for @entity5 , but it was the dynamic @entity1 who really caught the eye			1
' the best place to answer critics is on the pitch , ' said @entity0 , who was forced to defend the unimpressive @entity27 once again			1
' that 's what @entity1 did , but i do n't believe we can explain his good performance through the criticism of @entity7			1
' but you have to respond to critics when you 're in a public job			2
you have accept criticism , go on the pitch and show you have the talent			2
' the most important thing is to go show how good you are			0
' @entity1 finished with his right foot and chipped a goalkeeper who knows him well			1
i 'm very happy with that way he finished			0
the @entity4 academy product exchanged passes with @entity27 before chipping @entity17 ' he looked dangerous in the first half as well because he has found his pace again			1
' debate has raged over @entity1 's best position with @entity7 highlighting the uncertainty before saturday 's @entity52 showdown in his role as analyser for @entity55			1
but @entity7 was greeted by an irrepressible display that argued a watertight case for being involved in the advanced role favoured by @entity1 and @entity0			1
@entity6 coach @entity59 has used him more defensively , but @entity0 believes his strengths demand a different approach			1
' @entity1 was always a boy who was at his most dangerous in the final third			2
that 's why i prefer him to play higher up the pitch , ' @entity0 said			2
' one of his qualities is penetrating in the final third , but i 'm not against him being defensive			0
he can do both because he is a good footballer			0
@entity1 's performanceinspired @entity4 's comeback against @entity5 at the emirates ' for a long time he did n't kick the ball well because of his ankle injury			1
' the big difference now is that he stays on the feet , whereas before for a while when he was not as confident to push on his ankle he would go down			0
' now he has that solid aspect to the game he had before he was injured			0
' @entity1 took the diplomatic line by stating he is happy in either midfield role , but his words also made his preference clear			2
' naturally i want to go forward more			0
in @entity4 's formation it 's nice to play forward and in the @entity6 one it 's different			2
i 'm happy to play either way , ' @entity1 said			2
it was @entity1 's first goal since january and the @entity4 academy product admits he needs to be more prolific			1
@entity90 said that @entity4 were a better side than last year with ' more quality all over the pitch ' ' i want to score more goals and my goalscoring record has n't been good enough , ' @entity1 added			1
' in the formation we play i should be scoring more goals			0
we play with one holding and two going forward and i 'm the one who gets forward			0
' i 've had a few chances already this season and i should be scoring more			0
hopefully that will be one of many			0
' @entity1 highlighted the new found spirit that ensured @entity4 would not fold after slipping a goal behind and @entity5 captain @entity90 was impressed by what he saw			1
' they have definitely made progress			0
they are a better side			0
they have more quality all over the pitch , ' @entity90 said			0
' obviously they played well but they did n't have too many clear - cut chances			0
' they did n't need too many to score twice , which is the sign of a strong team			0
' @entity122 applauds ' quality ' match			2
