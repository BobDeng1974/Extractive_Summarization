bogus : @entity7 would buy goods then make fake @entity4 receipts on her home computer and return them for a higher refund the prosecutor said in april , 2011 , @entity7 was spotted at the @entity23 again , recognised , followed and detained after a checkout transaction			1

' he said she was ' not a career criminal by any stretch of the imagination , ' and had gone back to the same store			0
he continued : ' it really was n't that well thought out , that well planned or that sophisticated			0
' mr @entity92 said : ' she clearly did n't need the money			2
she 's clearly very well off , very comfortable indeed and continues to be so at this particular time			0

he said : ' it 's a very strange set of circumstances which is quite difficult to understand and explain			0
' these offences were reasonably sophisticated and it appears the motivation was an irrational anxiety that you would run out of money and you were trying to plug possible gaps by obtaining relatively small amounts of money on a number of occasions			1
