for the last few years the self - styled biggest club in the world , @entity0 , have not even appeared the biggest club on their home patch			1
the ‘ noisy neighbours ’ of @entity5 have spent more and won more			1
and the sir @entity7 factor vanished from @entity8 when he retired in 2013			0
in fact the last time @entity0 won a derby at home was in 2011 when @entity13 ’s late spectacular acrobatic goal earned them a 2 - 1 victory			1
@entity13 scored a spectacular overhead kick as @entity0 beat @entity5 2 - 1 in 2011 @entity0 sit above @entity5 in the @entity18 table for the first time in 16 months after having played the same amount of matches - following the latest round of results @entity13 ( centre ) scored a stunning half - volley as @entity0 beat @entity26 3 - 1 on april 4 meanwhile @entity5 players look crestfallen during their 2 - 1 defeat at @entity29 on easter monday night but there has been a sudden and surprising shift this season			1
@entity0 have forced their way above @entity5 in the @entity18 table for the first time since november 2013 , and should @entity37 ’s red - hot team beat their suddenly - fragile rivals on sunday afternoon , they will move four points clear of the defending champions			1
for many , then , the natural balance of power will have been restored			0
@entity5 manager @entity42 is no longer trying to hide the collapse of his side ’s season , which has seen them slip to fourth and make an early exit from three cup competitions , including the coveted @entity49			2
having defended his side earlier following losses at @entity53 and @entity29 , the @entity50 has decided to be more candid ahead of the derby			0
‘ it has not been a good season , definitely not a good season , ’ he said			0
‘ it was not so bad until the end of 2014 , we were top of the table and still in the @entity49			0
but in the last three months , we have thrown it into the garbage , all that we did earlier			0
we are doing some things very badly , that ’s why we must improve			0
’ admitting there is a problem is always the first step to recovery but @entity42 , who has won his last three games against @entity0 , appears a little less sure about how to fix it			2
city boss @entity42 has branded the last three months of their season as ' garbage ' due to poor form the @entity50 ( left ) cut a frustrated figure during @entity5 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity81 monday night his players have been derided as an ageing first - team squad			1
fifteen of them are 29 or over , including captain @entity85 , who is experiencing his worst season at @entity5			2
but @entity42 will not go along with such a theory , saying defensively : ‘ i do n’t think the best players at the end can suddenly grow old in three months			0
’ nonetheless , he clearly believes @entity5 must flex their financial muscles again to replenish the squad , just as they did in 2008 when the new @entity93 owners broke the @entity95 transfer record within 24 hours of their arrival to sign @entity97 for £ 32.5million			2
since then , they have spent £ 500m on transfer fees			0
‘ i will try to continue being noisy , ’ said the @entity50 , referring to @entity7 ’s famous quote about @entity5 in 2010			1
‘ all the big teams spend a lot of money , always			0
people just talk about it when it ’s @entity5			2
’ the problem for @entity42 is that @entity0 are back in the game , competing for the top players following a brief @entity108 wobble			2
united executive vice-chairman @entity109 , who has overall responsibility for the budget , is determined his club will not be bullied out of deals as they were when @entity5 beat them to @entity114 , from @entity115			1
@entity42 wants @entity5 to flex their financial muscle in this summer 's transfer market to bolster their squad @entity5 pipped rivals united to the signing of @entity114 ( right ) from @entity115 in august 2011 @entity122 , after five consecutive @entity18 wins , is equally bullish , declaring : ‘ i do n’t have any doubt that players are coming to @entity0			1
’ negotiations for @entity127 ’s @entity126 and @entity128 are understood to be under way but the acid test will be for @entity131 and @entity133 star @entity132 , 22 , rated the best young midfield player in @entity135 and coveted by @entity0 and @entity5			1
both will throw money and the promise of titles at £ 60m @entity132 , who began his career at @entity8 but was allowed to leave for @entity141 after a rare error of judgment by @entity7			0
city say there are mitigating factors why they are a point behind @entity0			2
@entity148 thinks @entity0 ’s absence from the @entity49 has helped them			2
‘ it does n’t surprise me @entity0 are doing well , they have had the advantage of only having the @entity18 to play for , just as @entity153 did last season , ’ said the @entity150			2
‘ it will be a hard game for us but we can definitely win			0
’ the future of @entity42 will come under huge scrutiny if he loses this match			0
he has been given some comfort by @entity122 , who dismisses @entity5 ’s last result , a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity29 , as a virtual fluke			1
@entity128 ( right ) anchors @entity127 's midfield and could be brought by @entity0 in the summer @entity126 ( left ) looks likely to join @entity0 this summer to strengthen their porous rearguard @entity131 ' £ 60million - rated midfielder @entity132 is also a summer target for @entity0 and their rivals @entity5 ‘ i saw the game , watching on tv at home with a cup of coffee			1
@entity29 went 2 - 0 ahead but you could not imagine it was a 2 - 0 game , ’ said the @entity0 manager			1
‘ we have also played these kind of matches			2
the opponents crossed the halfway line three times and they scored two goals but that ’s football , and more so in @entity182 than in other countries			0
‘ @entity5 were unlucky and , of course , confidence is a big thing in football			0
but sunday is another game , a special game and it shall not influence a lot			0
’ @entity13 ’s brilliant winner against @entity5 in 2011 was voted the best @entity18 goal of all - time			1
the @entity0 captain still regards it as his favourite			0
‘ it was my best goal because of the importance of it			0
we won the game and soon after we won the title , ’ he said			0
should @entity0 win on sunday , their supporters will dare to dream of such moments again			1
but if @entity5 can upset the odds and prove they are still a major force to be reckoned with , the noise will reverberate around @entity135 - and even reach @entity132			1
@entity0 manager @entity37 believes @entity5 's defeat at @entity29 wo n't influence sunday 's derby expected team line - ups for the @entity209 derby at @entity8 on sunday afternoon so far @entity5 boss @entity42 has a 100 per cent record against @entity0 since he succeeded @entity211			1
@entity5 4 - 1 @entity0 , september 2013 @entity212 scored twice as @entity42 celebrated victory in his first @entity209 derby while another managerial debutant , @entity215 , watched his @entity0 side taken apart			1
@entity0 0 - 3 @entity5 , march 2014 @entity217 scored after just 45 seconds at @entity8 and later added another as @entity5 completed a league double over @entity0			1
@entity42 will have to think about starting the @entity221 striker today			0
@entity5 1 - 0 @entity0 0 , november 2014 different manager in the @entity0 dug - out , same result			1
@entity212 struck again after @entity224 had been sent off for @entity0 .			0

@entity0 host rivals @entity5 in the league on sunday
@entity0 last beat @entity5 in the derby at home came in a 2 - 1 win four years *ago*
@entity0 sit above @entity5 in the table after having played the same amount of league matches for the first time since november 2013
@entity0 can move four points clear of their ' noisy neighbours ' with victory
