just 8p in every £ 10 spent looking after dementia patients goes on research into the causes , shocking figures reveal			2
the outlay on stroke research is little better , with 19p allocated from each £ 10 spent on the health and social needs of patients			0
a study says the amount spent by the government and charities studying dementia and strokes is ‘ still way too low ’			2
just 11 per cent of research funding from he @entity11 and charities into the @entity19 ’s leading causes of death and disability was allocated to dementia , research has found despite extra cash pumped into the two diseases recently by government bodies , they remain underfunded given the economic and personal impact felt by millions of sufferers and their families , say researchers			1
in comparison to cancer and coronary heart disease they are still poor relations , according to calculations by @entity39 academics			0
the amount spent on cancer research is around 13 times higher than dementia , and almost six times more than stroke			2
the spend on heart disease is eight times that of dementia and triple the amount spent on stroke research , says the study published in the online journal @entity54			0
researchers assessed central government and charity research expenditure in 2012 into the @entity19 ’s leading causes of death and disability – cancer , coronary heart disease , dementia and stroke which together accounted for over half of all deaths			1
the combined amount of research funding allocated by the government and charities to the four conditions came to £ 856million in 2012 , almost two - thirds of which was allocated to cancer			1
around one - fifth was devoted to coronary heart disease , while just 11 per cent was allocated to dementia and 7 per cent to stroke research			1
the study found a significant shift in funding since 2008 , particularly after a commitment by the @entity80 to new money for dementia research			1
but the sums allocated by charities have scarcely budged since 2008 , possibly because they rely on public donations which may be affected by ‘ a form of ageism ’ where dementia and stroke are seen as inevitable only in the elderly			2
research leader professor @entity91 , of the @entity93 at the @entity94 of @entity95 , @entity39 , said overall research funding has not been cut but priorities had shifted			1
almost two - thirds of research funding allocated by to the four conditions was allocated to cancer overall research spending by government bodies went up 20 per cent over the period , but there was a change in diseases that benefited			1
in 2012 , £ 157million was spent on cancer research by government bodies , down from £ 267million in 2008			0
prof @entity91 said : ‘ there was increasing recognition that expenditure on dementia should rise and this was reflected in the @entity80 agreement			0
‘ as a consequence less was spent on cancer because of the increasing emphasis on dementia and stroke , but these areas remain underfunded when compared with the burden of disease			0
’ he said research funding was ‘ still way too low ’ in both diseases , especially for stroke			1
there are at least 800,000 dementia patients and 1.2million stroke victims needing health and social care each year in the @entity19 , compared with 2.3million cases of cancer and the same number of heart disease cases			2
costs of healthcare were highest for cancer at £ 4.4billion and lowest for dementia at £ 1.4billion and stroke at £ 1.8billion			0
but social care costs of dementia outweighed social care costs of the other three conditions combined			0
health and social care for dementia cost £ 11.6billion in 2012 – more than double the equivalent bill for cancer			0
this means that for every £ 10 of health and social care costs attributable to each condition , £ 1.08 in research funding was spent on cancer , 65p on coronary heart disease , 19p on stroke , and just 8p on dementia , the researchers calculated			1
@entity156 , of @entity157 , said the charity has more than doubled its annual commitment to research since 2008			0
she added : ‘ it will be vital for the next government to make dementia research a priority if we are to defeat the condition			0
’ dr @entity167 , of @entity168 , said : ‘ @entity168 has pledged to spend at least £ 100million on dementia research over the next decade – more than ever before – but if we ’re going to improve the quality of care , develop better treatments and ultimately cure dementia we need politicians to pledge continued commitment and set out an ambition to create a step change in research funding			1
’ dr @entity179 , of the @entity180 , said that if the ‘ wholly inadequate ’ level of research funding into stroke remains the same , ‘ we will not be ready for the challenges a growing and ageing population will bring ’ .			2

just 11 per cent of research funding is allocated to dementia
money comes from both the @entity19 government and charities
almost two - thirds research funding was allocated to cancer
