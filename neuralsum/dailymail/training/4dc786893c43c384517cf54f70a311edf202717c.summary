by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 07:57 est , 31 july 2012 today should see the opening shots fired as the billion - dollar @entity4 v @entity3 patent case gets underway in a @entity6 courtroom			1
the two bitter rivals are arguing over a cluster of phone patents , each alleging that the other is infringing on intellectual property as they vie for top place in the smartphone wars			0
both companies are seeking potentially billions of pounds from each other in royalties - and whatever decision the 10 people on the jury takes , it is likely to will change the industry forever			0
opening arguments are expected today to decide the merits of @entity4 claims that @entity3 smartphones and computer tablets are ' illegal knockoffs ' of the @entity28 and @entity29			1
the @entity30 and the @entity31 : @entity4 claims @entity3 ripped off their phone with the @entity34 range if the case goes @entity4 's way , @entity3 may be forced to pay out $ 2.5billion , and experts say the @entity39 community may find itself mired in lawsuits - with @entity41 itself dragged into the fight			1
if the case goes @entity3 's way , @entity4 may need to pay out on patents owned by @entity3 - and this may mean @entity28 prices will increase			1
opening arguments in federal court will be followed by @entity4 calling its first witness , a company designer			2
the witness lists of both sides are long on experts , engineers and designers and short on familiar names			0
@entity4 ceo @entity59 , for example , is not scheduled to testify			0
@entity4 filed a lawsuit against the @entity62 company last year alleging smartphones and computer tablets made by the world 's largest technology company are illegal knockoffs of @entity4 's popular @entity28 and @entity29 products			2
to the consumers , they are arch - rivals , with the @entity73 smartphone competing directly with the @entity28 and being the runaway success of @entity39 handsets			0
in the courts the fighting is even more fierce , with @entity4 repeatedly trying to stop @entity3 selling phones and tablets around the world			1
but in business , @entity3 is one of @entity4 's top suppliers - and @entity4 will spend an estimated £ 7billion on @entity3 parts for their products , including iphones and @entity29 , this year			1
the amount is expected to increase until at least 2014 under the current terms of their contract , according to a deal reported earlier this year			0
the @entity92 said that @entity4 bought around £ 4.9billion worth of parts from @entity3 in 2011 including displays , mobile application processors , nand flash chips and mobile memory			1
you will find @entity3 processors , displays and memory chips inside the new @entity29			0
@entity4 's much - admired ' @entity102 ' displays are also manufactured by @entity3			1
@entity4 is demanding $ 2.5 billion in damages , an award that would dwarf the largest patent - related verdict to date			0
@entity3 countered that @entity4 is doing the stealing and that some of the technology at issue - such as the rounded rectangular designs of smartphones and tablets - has been industry standards for years			2
the case is just the latest skirmish between the companies over product designs			0
a similar trial began last week , and the two companies have been fighting in courts in the @entity120 and @entity121			0
@entity123 district judge @entity122 last month ordered @entity3 to pull its @entity34 10.1 computer tablet from the @entity123 market pending the outcome of the upcoming trial , though she barred @entity4 attorneys from telling the jurors about the ban			1
' that 's a pretty strong statement from the judge and shows you what she thinks about some of @entity4 's claims , ' said @entity137 , a @entity138 law professor and patent expert			0
he said that even though the case will be decided by 10 jurors , the judge has the authority to overrule their decision if she thinks they got it wrong			0
' in some sense the big part of the case is not @entity4 's demands for damages but whether @entity3 gets to sell its products , ' said @entity153 , a @entity155 professor and director of the @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 , and technology			2
@entity153 said a verdict in @entity4 's favor could send a message to consumers that @entity39 - based products such as @entity3 's are in legal jeopardy			1
a verdict in @entity3 's favor , especially if it prevails on its demands that @entity4 pay its asking price to certain transmission technology it controls , could lead to higher - priced @entity4 products			1
@entity4 lawyers argue there is almost no difference between @entity3 's products and @entity4 's and that @entity3 internal documents show it copied @entity4 's iconic designs and its interface			2
@entity3 denies the allegation and counter-claims that @entity4 copied its iconic iphone from @entity183			2
@entity3 lawyers noted the company has been developing mobile phones since 1991 and that @entity4 jumped into the market in 2007 .			1

@entity4 vs @entity3 begins in *earnest* today following legal *scuffles* across the world
jury of ten ready to listen to arguments in trial which is expected to run for four weeks
experts say verdict could *affect* *evolution* of smartphone market
