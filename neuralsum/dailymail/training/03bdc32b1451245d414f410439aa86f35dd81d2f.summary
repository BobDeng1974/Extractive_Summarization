when sir @entity1 had a velodrome named after him ahead of the @entity3 , he probably presumed he could enter the arena at his own accord			1
but on thursday , the six - time @entity6 was reportedly asked to present his id by security on the first day of action			1
@entity35 , who will be competing in the velodrome this summer , said : ‘ it is a bit odd			2
i ’d be a bit p * * * * * off if i were him because they ’ve stuck a great big @entity42 sign over his name and it does n’t stand out that it ’s the sir @entity1 velodrome other than a little thing as you walk in			1
it ’s more like a shopping sign with an @entity42 thing on it			2
' ‘ i think there should be more made for him			0
stick a whopping great statue outside because it does n’t hit you straight away that it ’s his velodrome			2
i think he got done over a bit			0
‘ but he wo n’t complain because he ’s far too nice			0
so i ’ll complain for him			0
they should do something about it			0
’ not good enough : @entity35 says he would be p * * * * * off with the way @entity1 has been treated getting ready to go : a @entity65 cyclist warms up in the sir @entity66 on day one @entity68 is back on track			1

@entity11 report that @entity1 was *stopped* by security on thursday
' sir @entity66 ' was opened for @entity17 action
@entity35 says the velodrome is not enough for @entity1
