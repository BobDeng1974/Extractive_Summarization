by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent reshuffle : mr justice @entity3 has been placed in charge of the @entity5 a judge who wants to ‘ let the light in ’ was put in charge of @entity10 ’s most secret court yesterday			1
mr justice @entity3 was made vice-president of the @entity5 , the tribunal that has been heavily criticised for making life - changing decisions out of sight of the public			1
the reshuffle means the @entity5 will from next month come under the full control of mr justice @entity3 , a family judge who has backed the drive for more openness in the courts			1
the appointment , made by lord chief justice @entity21 and justice secretary @entity22 , follows a series of scandals involving the court , which decides on the affairs of people too ill to decide for themselves			0
in april it was caught in controversy after the @entity30 revealed that a @entity5 judge had secretly jailed a woman over her attempts to get her father out of a care home where she thought his life was in danger			1
it was criticised again earlier this month after ordering that a woman who had been sectioned under the @entity40 undergo an involuntary caesarean			1
mr justice @entity3 has been judge - in - charge of the @entity5 – a non-statutory role – since 2011			1
the @entity43 said in an announcement yesterday that the new appointment ‘ will allow him to continue with the work he has begun as judge - in - charge ’			2

the @entity43 said mr justice @entity3 , 65 , will use ‘ his family background and his extensive experience to support the president ’			0
the judge told a committee of peers last month that there was a ‘ historical reluctance ’ to publish @entity5 judgments but this was going to change			2
‘ to my mind the impact of proceedings having more sunlight let in , more transparency , outweighs the difficulties that in some cases some people may have in having their privacy invaded , ’ he said			0
controversial : the @entity5 , unlike almost any other , is closed to public scrutiny he added that greater openness ‘ would improve the performance of all involved in the court process – i do n’t exclude judges from that ’			2
the switch means that one of the most senior judges , chancellor of the @entity50 sir @entity84 , loses the title of vice-president of the @entity5 after less than a year			0
sir @entity84 took up the post of @entity82 , including the @entity5 role , only in january .			0
