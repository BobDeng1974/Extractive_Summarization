by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:32 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 2 february 2013 lord @entity3 ’s brother has told the @entity4 that the fugitive aristocrat died in 2004 and is buried in @entity6			1
@entity7 is said to have made the startling disclosure in an ‘ unguarded moment ’ after an interview at his @entity12 home			1
when the cameras stopped rolling , he was pressed by a journalist on the @entity16 programme about whether @entity3 – accused of murdering his children ’s nanny , @entity19 , in 1974 – was ‘ dead or alive ’			1
twist : the startling revelation was revealed by @entity19 's son @entity22 mr @entity7 , 72 , replied : ‘ i know for a fact my brother died in 2004 and that his grave is in @entity6			1
’ the alleged admission – which would mean @entity3 was 70 when he died – was revealed by mrs @entity19 ’s 46 - year - old son , @entity22			1
he took part in the same programme and has remained in close contact with reporter @entity31 , who interviewed mr @entity7			2
mr @entity22 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , said yesterday : ‘ the @entity4 and @entity31 have since been desperate to find the grave and make another documentary			1
’ only two minutes of the 90 - minute interview were broadcast last december			0
it is largely unremarkable , with mr @entity7 repeating his previously aired view that his brother escaped after @entity40 , 29 , was bludgeoned to death at the peer ’s @entity43 home			1
resources : detectives thought @entity3 , left , fled abroad helped by his powerful friends including billionaire sir @entity48 after the murder of @entity19 , right , ‘ i believe my brother was innocent but i do n’t believe he would commit suicide , ’ he said			1
‘ he was a man of considerable resourcefulness , so i imagine he used those resources to remove himself from the picture			0
’ but mr @entity7 ’s subsequent claim is likely to be seized on by detectives			2
police said they were unaware of it last night			0
the @entity59 has been shown a 2002 police report that details the evidence against the @entity62 and outlines @entity64 ’s strategy			0
it reveals that officers looked into sightings of @entity3 in @entity68 , where he was said to be living under an assumed name			2
@entity6 : @entity64 detectives had looked into sightings of @entity3 in @entity68 where he was said to be living under an assumed identity the report says : ‘ recent developments have included alleged sightings of @entity3 in @entity6			1
enquiries have yielded photographs of a person who is the subject of these reported sightings			0
‘ with a little imagination , these photos are sufficiently close to @entity3 ’s possible appearance to warrant submission to a facial imaging expert			2
’ it adds that the man was living on an estate containing a ranch and several small holiday chalets			0
‘ locals refer to this complex as @entity3 ’s house			2
should enquiries be desirable in @entity68 or @entity6 , a potential source ( a recent former @entity97 police officer ) , who is familiar with the locale , is available for low - level intelligence gathering			2
’ it is believed that @entity3 , a professional gambler , mistook mrs @entity19 for his wife @entity103 , from whom he was estranged , and hit her with lead piping			1
@entity105 was also attacked but managed to escape			0
lord @entity3 telephoned his mother , asking her to collect his children , and then drove to a friend ’s house in @entity110			1
he left hours later and was never seen again			0
detectives have long thought the 7th @entity62 fled abroad helped by his powerful friends , including billionaire sir @entity48			0
despite sightings across the world , most detectives who worked on the case believe @entity6 would have given the peer the best opportunity of living anonymously			0
although mr @entity7 dismissed the @entity68 sightings , he has said in a previous interview he was ‘ sure ’ his brother fled to @entity6			1
last night , he said he did not wish to speak about his brother			0
the @entity4 declined to comment .			0

@entity125 drove to friend 's house in @entity110 then *disappeared*
