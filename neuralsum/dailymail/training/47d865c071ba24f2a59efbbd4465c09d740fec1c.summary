@entity0 : the @entity2 is by far the biggest stage of all , it ’s @entity4 and @entity6 ’s last chance to shine @entity0 : is @entity7 the new @entity8 ? @entity9 will suffer if they keep it tight with @entity11 ... he must be brave , as he promised @entity0 : @entity9 must be adventurous and take the @entity2 by storm or go out in glory ... my starting xi for the opener with @entity11 the most underrated player in the @entity17 ? @entity18			1
in an era when we are searching for young @entity26 talent , players who can keep the ball ; and admiring – almost over-admiring – those who step forward and show some technique , it ’s amazing this kid has been overlooked			0
he ’s not only got ability , he ’s got bottle as well			0
for a kid to let his contract run down so that he can leave @entity32 on a free transfer and join his boyhood club @entity34 , is the ultimate in football bravery			1
it ’s right up there with @entity41 ’s evil switch from @entity42 to @entity43			1
@entity41 recently claimed he was surprised at the venomous reaction from the @entity42 fans			2
i hope @entity18 is n’t as naive – he will get fearful abuse from the @entity32 fans when the @entity50 derbies take place			2
but he does n’t deserve it			0
happy days : new signing @entity18 holds a @entity34 scarf and poses for photographs pitch side montage : @entity32 tweeted this picture of @entity18 scoring and celebrating against @entity34 cross rivalry : @entity18 's move is right up there with @entity41 ¿ s evil switch from @entity43 to @entity42 put it this way – if @entity18 had come through the acclaimed @entity66 academy , he would have made their first team , played in central midfield and probably been in @entity69 right now preparing for @entity70			1
but @entity32 shifted him to left back , kept changing manager , and @entity18 ’s talents have never really been able to flourish over a decent period of time at the @entity75			1
@entity18 was in the same youth team as @entity77			0
when a space came up in the @entity32 midfield , @entity77 took it , and @entity18 went on loan to @entity82			1
it could easily have been the other way round			0
all change : @entity32 's form drastically improved when @entity86 put @entity18 back into midfield @entity86 eventually trusted @entity18 in central midfield , and @entity32 ’s form was phenomenal			1
he ’s just an honest lad who wants to play for the club he supported as a boy , his hometown team			0
every @entity32 supporter can understand that concept , so they should thank @entity18 , wish him all the best , and move on			2
but football sadly does n’t work like that			0
unbelievable : @entity86 worked a miracle to eventually keep @entity32 in the @entity17			0

it 's amazing @entity18 has been overlooked by many clubs and @entity9
his move to @entity34 is up there with @entity41 's switch from @entity42 to @entity43
the transfer is brave , and why should he not play for his boyhood club ?
if @entity18 had gone through the @entity66 academy he would probably be heading to @entity70
@entity86 trusted @entity18 in midfield , and @entity32 ’s form was phenomenal
