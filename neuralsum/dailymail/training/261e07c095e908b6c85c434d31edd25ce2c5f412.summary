@entity2 's @entity1 team produced the greatest football of their dominant four - year spell in world football against @entity6 – during a @entity8 semi-final in which they eventually lost on aggregate			1
the claim comes from one of @entity2 's closest assistants and the match in question was the epic @entity8 semi final in 2012 , when @entity6 drew 2 - 2 at the @entity16 , despite having ten men for most of the game , winning 3 - 2 on aggregate and progressing to the @entity8 final where they beat @entity19			1
a performance against @entity22 at the @entity23 in 2010 is also high on the list of the finest moments of @entity1 's @entity2 , reckoned by many judges to be the one of the greatest teams of all - time after they won an extraordinary two @entity8 trophies , two @entity30 , three @entity32 trophies and two @entity34 @entity33 in @entity35 's four years at the club			1
@entity6 beat @entity1 3 - 2 on aggregate in 2012 , with @entity38 netting a late goal to seal it but @entity2 's closest assistant believes @entity1 were playing their best football at the time @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 look despondent after the game at the @entity16 @entity46 : the @entity47 is out now but in a compliment to @entity51 's @entity6 team , @entity2 and his assistant @entity48 discuss the best football played by the @entity1 team , debating whether the 2012 semi final with @entity48 saying the @entity6 game was the team 's peak			1
the new book , @entity46 , reveals : ' guardiola and @entity48 get involved in a debate about the best moments of @entity1 's recent golden era			2
for @entity48 the absolute peaks were : ' the first half against @entity22 at the @entity23 [ march 31 , 2010			0
2 - 2 ] and the first half against @entity6 in the @entity8 semi-final of 2012			2
we never played better than those two days			0
' the performance against @entity6 was fabulous but i think we played better in the final of the @entity72 against @entity73 ( in 2011 )			0
that was our all - time peak			0
' the @entity22 game in 2010 saw an exquisite @entity1 team go into a 2 - 0 lead before @entity80 's side came back with two second half goals to create probably the greatest @entity8 game seen at the stadium			1
@entity22 eventually lost the tie 6 - 3 on aggregate			2
the @entity6 semi-final saw @entity6 travel to the @entity16 with a 1 - 0 lead from the first leg			0
but @entity1 , playing some extraordinary football , went into a 2 - 0 lead , and , with @entity92 sent off shortly before half time , @entity6 seemed doomed			2
but @entity94 scored for @entity6 and @entity95 missed a penalty for @entity1 before a late goal from @entity38 confirmed @entity6 in the final			2
@entity51 was delighted after progressing to the @entity8 final , which they went on to win @entity2 , meanwhile , believes @entity1 were at the peak of their powers when playing @entity22 in 2010 @entity104 also feature in @entity2 's discussions about the best his teams have played , with last year 's 3 - 1 victory at the @entity108 considered to be the peak display by @entity110 last season			1
ironically it is @entity22 who were also responsible for the worst ten minutes of @entity110 's football last season			0
@entity2 , who now coaches the @entity116 club and won the league and cup double last season , faced @entity80 's side in the last 16 of the @entity8 and eventually saw his side run at 2 - 0 winners at the @entity23 and 3 - 1 on aggregate – but only after an excellent start in @entity125 by @entity22			1
in the book @entity2 is quoted as saying : ' our worst 10 minutes this season were in the @entity23			0
@entity130 's hand saved us that day , ' he reflected			0
' our best ? probably the game against @entity104 in @entity133 or the first 40 minutes of the @entity135 match in @entity136			0
' ' @entity46 : the @entity47 of @entity2 's @entity137 at @entity110 , out now in paperback and ebook , published by @entity140			1

@entity6 won @entity8 semi-fina 3 - 2 on aggregate
@entity94 and @entity38 scored for 10 - men blues at the @entity16
but @entity48 claims @entity1 were at their best in game
@entity2 felt they hit top form against @entity22 or @entity73
