by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 13:01 est , 27 june 2012 two million years ago , one of our distant ancestors lived on leaves and fruit from the trees in @entity7			1
scans of fossil teeth show the short and gangly @entity10 lived on a hard diet of trees , bushes and fruit two million years ago - similar to a chimpanzee			1
but virtually all other ancient human ancestors from @entity7 tucked into softer meals of grasses and sedges - even the ' @entity20 ' , @entity21 , with his massive jaws and teeth			1
an analysis of the teeth of the short , gangly hominin australopithecus sediba shows it had a diet unlike virtually all of our other known ancestors a. sediba had an upright posture and long arms , and embodied characteristics of both primitive and modern hominids - including a human - like ankle , short fingers and a long thumb for possible precision gripping and a relatively complex brain compared to earlier hominids			1
researchers made the discovery by zapping fossilised teeth with a laser , which frees carbon from the enamel - allowing scientists to find the types of plants consumed and environments where the hominids lived			2
although bark and woody tissues had not been documented as a dietary component of any other ancient @entity7 hominids before , these foods had been scoffed by many contemporary primates and contain both protein and soluble sugars			2
the diet of a. sediba also may have been similar to that of today 's @entity7 savanna chimpanzees			1
the researchers also discovered microscopic , fossilised particles of plant tissue called phytoliths trapped in ancient tooth tartar - a hardened form of dental plague			2
@entity71 doctoral student @entity70 said : ‘ the fact that these phytoliths are preserved in the teeth of 2 - million - year - old hominids is remarkable and speaks to the amazing preservation at the site			1
boning up on the facts : a right hand skeleton of @entity79 superimposed against a modern human hand remarkable find : one of two sets of bones from @entity79 are unveiled at the @entity84 in @entity85 this week ancient : scientists say the bones are 1.977million years old ‘ the phytolith data suggest the a. sediba individuals were avoiding the grasses growing in open grasslands that were abundant in the region at the time			0
‘ it is an important finding because diet is one of the fundamental aspects of an animal , one that drives its behaviour and ecological niche			0
‘ as environments change over time because of shifting climates , animals are generally forced to either move or to adapt to their new surroundings			0
‘ what fascinates me is that these individuals are oddballs			0
i had pretty much convinced myself that after 4 million years ago most of our hominid kin had diets that were different from living apes , but now i am not so sure			0
‘ and while our sample is too small to be conclusive , the rate at which @entity117 is spewing hominid fossils makes me reasonably certain we wo n't have to wait another two million years to augment our data set			0
’ the study was published by @entity122			0
it was helped by the @entity124 , @entity125 , the @entity126 and the @entity84 , both in @entity7 , and @entity127 .			2

two - million - year - old @entity7 had different diet to other *pre-humans*
' *missing* link ' fossil analysed to judge diet
short , gangly creature ate leaves and fruit like chimps
