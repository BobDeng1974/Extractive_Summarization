@entity0 held a meeting with @entity3 's players to refocus their minds on @entity6 qualification after @entity8 's future came under question			1
this weekend is arguably @entity3 ' biggest match of their season , with former manager @entity12 returning to @entity13 's for the first time since leaving for @entity15 in the summer			2
just a point and a place separate @entity0 's men from @entity15 in sixth , although this season 's surprise success has brought with it speculation that players will exit much like last summer			1
@entity0 held a meeting with @entity3 's players to refocus their minds on @entity6 qualification @entity8 's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at move to @entity27 @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 have all been linked with a move away , while @entity8 was quoted on thursday claiming @entity27 were interested in his services			1
the @entity33 denied making those comments in subsequently deleted @entity36 posts - an incident which proved the catalyst to @entity0 sitting his squad down on thursday morning			0
' i spoke to @entity8 this morning , ' @entity0 said			2
' we had a meeting with all the players because what we need is now to really have the focus on the last five games			0
we play for a @entity6 position on the table			0
' we have a massive game this saturday and no interest in talking about rumours in the press about future and contracts and have the focus on the football side			0
' that 's difficult but it 's not true what they put in the press and i believe the player			0
@entity0 spoke to @entity8 and his other players to refocus them on the last five @entity66 games @entity28 has been linked with moves to @entity27 and @entity15 in another @entity3 firesale ' it 's a good signal for everybody that we have to be focused to the football side and not about the contracts			1
i do not answer any more questions about player 's contracts and the focus on the last five games			0
' @entity0 called the @entity8 story ' bulls * * * ' in a separate interview and the midfielder later posted on @entity36 to clarify the situation			1
' sorry - was caught off guard this morning about a story that i had n't read , ' he said			0
' to put it straight : we all respect @entity27 but right now i 'm only focussed on helping @entity3 to have a strong finish to the season			1
@entity90 are said to be interested in signing @entity3 's @entity91 right back @entity29 ' the newspaper article does not say that i have spoken to @entity93 or anyone else from @entity27 - and that 's the truth			1
' we are doing so well and what other managers think of me as a player is totally out of my control			0
' @entity8 is one of a number of players to have spoken about their future in recent months , with such comments becoming increasingly regular as the season comes to a close			2
a week does not go by without @entity0 having to field questions about the future of his players and that is something he says has to stop			2
@entity30 is still not back from a year - long injury lay - off but he has been linked to @entity111 ' it 's not a lot about the players but in my case as well because i have always to answer questions about @entity28 , about @entity29 , about the future of the players , ' he said			1
' i think now is the moment to really focus on what we have to do which is to win the games and not about future of players			0
' if i keep going talking about future of players , it 's easy for the players to do the same and we said together we need to be focused on the football side and we do n't need to talk about the other side			2
