by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 19:29 est , 28 september 2012 there is something vaguely disconcerting about the sight of @entity4 with a smile playing on his pudgy lips , not least because he usually bears such a strong resemblance to a lugubrious @entity10 jug			1
yet there is no doubt that the perennially gloomy tv presenter has plenty to be jovial about at the moment — this week the 45 - year - old was photographed canoodling with his girlfriend , comedienne @entity17			1
he and miss @entity17 , 44 , were kissing and cuddling like lovestruck teenagers in a park in @entity21 , @entity22 , she sporting a slouchy , tartan shirt - dress , while he wore a pair of faded cargo shorts of the type that might constitute warm weather attire on any @entity30 building site			1
new couple : perennially gloomy tv presenter @entity4 , 45 , has plenty to be jovial about at the moment after being photographed canoodling with his girlfriend , comedienne @entity17 , 44 the fact that the @entity36 liaison is already nearly a year old apparently means they ’re well past the stage where they ’re dressing up to the nines for each other			1
but what they lack in sartorial punch , they certainly make up for in easy togetherness			0
clearly , it is not an interest in fashion that unites the pair			0
in fact , surprisingly , they have bonded over a mutual and deep faith in @entity54			1
‘ they are both devoutly religious , ’ a friend and colleague of @entity57 - born @entity4 told the @entity58 this week			1
‘ i ’m pretty sure they have also gone to church together from time to time , and they pray together			0
‘ it ’s not something either of them really talks about , but their faith is very important			2
they ’re not happy - clappy or evangelical , they just share a love of @entity54			1
’ looking at them , it is certainly hard to imagine a more content - looking couple			2
one @entity77 - based @entity76 , who saw the couple out in the city this week , told me : ‘ they were window shopping in the sunshine , but every time they stopped , or waited to cross the road , he had his hand on her stomach like an expectant father would			2
‘ maybe it ’s that they are so comfortable with each other and he ’s just the tactile type , but my immediate thought was : “ i wonder if she ’s pregnant ? ” ’ whatever the case , miss @entity17 ’s relationship with @entity4 is progressing apace , to the extent that in the summer he flew his lover out to @entity102 , from where he was presenting @entity105 ’s coverage of the @entity107 football tournament , and , apparently , took her on a ‘ date ’ to the @entity109 death camp			1
so what is the story behind their spiritual connection ? in love : mr @entity4 and miss @entity17 were kissing and cuddling like lovestruck teenagers in a park in @entity21 , @entity22 , she sporting a slouchy , tartan shirt - dress , while he wore a pair of faded cargo shorts @entity4 , who was brought up in the @entity122 church but converted to @entity123 five years ago , is understood to have introduced convent school - educated miss @entity17 to a select group of his religious mentors over the past year			1
key figures in his life include father @entity129 , an @entity130 who lives at @entity132 in @entity133 , and @entity134 , a television director and , like @entity4 , an avid @entity137 fan , who acted as his ‘ sponsor ’ during his conversion			1
understandably , both men are protective of their protege			0
' it ’s not something either of them really talks about , but their faith is very important			2
they ’re not happy - clappy or evangelical , they just share a love of @entity54 ' friend and colleague of @entity4 ‘ i could n’t say anything without talking to @entity4 about it first , ’ mr @entity134 told me this week			1
however , other friends admit that @entity4 and miss @entity17 — famous for her catchphrase ‘ am i bovvered ? ’ — are uncannily similar			1
both confess to being natural - born worriers and pessimists , and both have seen long - term relationships founder — all of which makes their public display of affection all the more endearing			0
miss @entity17 is understood to be renting a house close to the @entity167 in @entity77 , where she is filming the @entity169 version of @entity170			1
sources in @entity172 say she has been commuting between @entity173 and the programme ’s set since early may			0
after appearing on - and - off in the show as socially inept @entity76 @entity177 for the past 18 months , miss @entity17 plays a much bigger part in the current series , which began airing last week in the @entity180			1
she has become something of a regular fixture in the starry enclave of @entity21 , but , as a non-drinker , she avoids the @entity30 - style pubs where @entity77 - based expat actors congregate			1
happy couple : rumours that miss @entity17 , 44 , and mr @entity4 , 45 , were dating first emerged a year ago rumours that she and @entity4 were dating first emerged a year ago			1
and in july this year miss @entity17 , who has a nine - year - old daughter , @entity189 , with her ex-partner , was photographed on the back of @entity4 ’s motorbike in @entity173 , wearing knee - high boots			1
but their nascent love affair was dealt what might have been a terminal blow by the arrival on the scene at the end of last summer of @entity201 ’s @entity202			0
@entity17 and the handsome 42 - year - old singer met when she played him in a spoof version of the band for @entity206 in march last year			1
' they were window shopping in the sunshine , but every time they stopped , or waited to cross the road , he had his hand on her stomach like an expectant father would ' @entity77 - based @entity76 , who saw the couple in the city this week when she and @entity202 were introduced during the filming of the sketch , people on the set at the time say , she confidently asked the lantern - jawed singer for his number			0
meanwhile , members of @entity202 ’s inner circle told me this week that @entity231 comic @entity230 acted as matchmaker between the two after miss @entity17 and @entity202 went to cheer him on when he swam the @entity234 for charity last year			1
but they made an unlikely couple — a view shared by countless @entity201 fans who went on internet forums to accuse miss @entity17 in unflattering terms of punching above her weight			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , her relationship with the pop star cooled around @entity244 , when she stayed at home and @entity202 went off to detox at a @entity247 spa famous for its colonic irrigation and yoga in @entity250			0
with @entity202 off the scene , @entity4 made a sudden re-emergence in the life of the often - troubled comedy star			2
born @entity17 on the @entity256 council estate in @entity173 ’s @entity257 , she never knew her father , who split from her mother , @entity259 , before she was born			2
bullied for having ginger hair , @entity17 was afflicted as a child by a strange obsessive - compulsive disorder linked to the letters of the alphabet			2
one symptom meant she was convinced something terrible would happen if she left her jumper on the floor , because it began with the same letter as her mother ’s name			0
all smiles : surprisingly , mr @entity4 and miss @entity17 have bonded over a mutual and deep faith in @entity54 after attending the catholic notre dame school in @entity275 , @entity173 , she won a place at @entity277 and took a string of bit parts before being spotted performing at the @entity280 by a casting director			1
a role in the sitcom @entity284 , with @entity285 , followed , before she was given her own @entity287 show in 2004			0
but even as she was filming the first series of the @entity289 , she was succumbing to the trauma of acute postnatal depression following the birth of her daughter			0
her then partner , @entity294 , from whom she split last summer , gave up work as a stage manager to help her cope with the baby			0
@entity294 now has a flat around the corner from the £ 800,000 mews house where @entity17 and @entity189 live in @entity300 , @entity301			2
friends says the split has been amicable			0
@entity294 is regularly seen arriving in the morning to do the school run , and @entity189 often stays overnight with her father			0
@entity17 ’s career success has done little to lift the impression the comedienne gives of being shrouded by a pall of melancholy and angst			2
until recently , she fretted that @entity189 would choke on her breakfast cereal while she was away filming , and admits to suffering panic attacks , which she has sought to dispel with a rather obsessive interest in , among other things , astrology and the alignment of the planets			0
‘ i ’m an incredibly negative person , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’ve realised i need a gnawing , nagging , anxious doubt when i wake at 4am			0
’ which is where , one imagines , the overcast @entity4 comes in			2
after all , he has made a career of his distinctly downbeat demeanour			0
he married @entity325 , now a presenter of @entity327 ’s @entity326 , in 1998 , but they divorced three years ago on the grounds of his unreasonable behaviour			0
they have two daughters , @entity333 , 12 , and nine - year - old @entity334			0
@entity4 did a disastrous stint with his former @entity337 co-host @entity336 on @entity105 ’s @entity338			2
their reunion in september 2010 lasted until december last year , when they were axed as ratings tumbled			0
there had long been rumours about the nature of @entity4 ’s relationship with @entity347 , which was warm and affectionate and involved after - work curries at his @entity301 flat			2
but their friendship cooled when @entity353 - born @entity336 began dating @entity354 and @entity356 footballer @entity355 three years ago			0
judging by how things looked this week , however , it would seem that @entity4 ’s relationship with miss @entity17 is hotting up very nicely .			1

@entity4 , 45 , and @entity17 , 44 , were pictured in @entity22
couple have surprisingly bonded over mutual and deep faith in @entity54
kissed and cuddled in @entity21 park like lovestruck teenagers
