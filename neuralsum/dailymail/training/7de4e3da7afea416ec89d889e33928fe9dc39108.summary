by @entity0 published : 03:12 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 04:19 est , 21 august 2012 @entity2 's nuclear defence is under threat because the @entity4 will not have enough people to properly man its submarines , it was warned today			1
@entity10 subs and @entity2 boats holding nuclear weapons may have to stay in port as a result of staff shortages , internal @entity8 documents reveal			1
the @entity17 's official risk register says engineer numbers will also be down by 15 per cent within three years , causing even more problems for the @entity2 fleet			1
problems : vessels like @entity2 's top submarine @entity25 , pictured , may be understaffed , an official report reveals one in seven weapons officer posts ranked at lieutenant will also be vacant in the coming years , meaning there may not be enough people to fire weapons			1
the @entity4 is desperately trying to bolster its number of ' experienced ' mid-level staff on its six attack submarines and four large @entity25 boats that carry our @entity10 nuclear weapons			1
' there is a risk that the @entity4 will not have sufficient suitably qualified and experienced personnel to be able to support the manning requirement of the submarine fleet			1
anger : @entity10 has caused a great deal of protest , @entity45 activists pictured here in @entity49 , and its replacement programme could be threatened by a lack of experienced staff , documents warn ' inability to recruit , retain and develop sufficient nuclear and submarine design qualified personnel will result in an inability to support the @entity59 , ' it also warned			1
questioning @entity2 's ability to replace the controversial @entity10 missiles it said they are worried about the ' erosion of manufacturing capability , cost growth , time delay , and poor performance of contractors '			2
concerns : admiral @entity69 , of @entity70 says the the @entity4 must prepare for any staffing problems now there are currently 5,000 @entity4 submariners but at the moment some vessels are going out for tours with only 85 per cent of its staff capacity filled			2
the @entity17 is busy trying to find out how to attract and keep more staff as so many will spend up to four months without leaving the submarine			0
admiral @entity69 today called the situation ' worrying ' and that the @entity4 must have procedures in place to cope with any staff shortages			0
' there â€™s no doubt that recruiting and keeping highly qualified nuclear engineers has been tough			0
nuclear engineers have also become highly sought - after by the civil industry as this country has not trained enough , ' he told the @entity94			0
the @entity95 was handed to the @entity96			0
director @entity97 told the @entity94 : ' these risks highlight major pitfalls ahead and that @entity10 replacement is far from a forgone conclusion			0
how effective we are at mastering these risks will determine whether @entity2 can remain in the nuclear weapons business			2
' but the @entity17 today told @entity105 they were not worried about the situation			0
' this report recognises that the @entity4 has sufficient manpower for its submarines and we are confident that this will remain the case , ' a @entity4 spokesman said			0
' the @entity17 is committed to sustaining the highest safety standards and to maintaining the defence industrial supply chain to design , build and support the nuclear fleet			2

*government* ' risk register ' says they will be short on experienced staff to man the @entity2 fleet
' @entity123 to recruit ' will cause ' an inability to support the @entity59 , ' the report adds
