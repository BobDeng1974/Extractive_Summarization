supermarket giant @entity0 has again been caught out misleading customers over the freshness of its groceries			1
in commercials , aired in august and september , celebrity chef @entity4 makes reference to @entity8 grown apples being fresh at @entity0 right now and suggests that you ' feed your family better , fresher , with spring fruit and veg from @entity0			1
' following a complaint that the advertising was misleading , an investigation by the @entity14 found the company had breached the food code			1
' i live in @entity8 and my apple tree is dormant ! these apples would have been in storage for months , they are not fresh , ' he said			0
' this ad is misleading and my wife would like a personal apology from @entity4 ( or cash )			2
' @entity0 said it was satisfied that it was n't in breach of the food code and that the advertisement was not misleading			1
the food giant said it sourced the bulk of its apples from @entity8 , and the pink lady variety featured in the advertisement were harvested this year in @entity8 in the last half of april			1
it says for ten months of the year they could choose to source apples from outside of @entity57 to fulfil demand but it chooses to only sell apples from local growers			0
' @entity0 is able to continue to deliver a fresh apple outside of the harvesting period due to the availability of advanced cold storage facilities			2
' ' cold storage facilities place apples in a controlled low temperature and reduced oxygen ( no nitrogen is added ) environment to preserve their freshness			0
' while @entity0 said it was satisfied that it was n't in breach of the food code for its advertisement of pink lady apples , the @entity14 said it was in fact misleading @entity0 says it is able to continue to deliver a fresh apple outside of the harvesting period due to the availability of advanced cold storage facilities @entity0 said it considers apples can remain fresh , even if placed in cold storage because ' @entity87 ' is determined with regard to the quality			1
' @entity0 ' view that produce can remain ' fresh ' despite storage is consistent with the @entity93 , which defines ' fresh ' as retaining the original properties unimpaired , ' it said			0
the @entity14 noted that whilst the use of the word ‘ fresh ’ in relation to apples is not misleading , the reference to ‘ @entity101 ’ fruit changes the context of the word ‘ fresh ’ to imply that the apples have been freshly picked during the @entity101 season ready for immediate sale			2
the @entity14 also considered that the likely interpretation of the advertisement by the average consumer would be that the @entity8 apples being promoted as fresh this @entity101 would have been freshly picked in recent weeks and not over 3 months ago			2
it also referred to another case of ' fresh ' produce at @entity112 in 2012 where the company was not deemed to be misleading in using the word ‘ fresh ’ on the basis that @entity112 had stated they may use cold storage , not freezing			0
