@entity0 has called for a ban on selling arms to @entity3 following her resignation from the @entity5 @entity0 ’s call for a ban on selling arms to @entity3 received its most high - profile @entity10 backing last night			1
a day after her shock departure from @entity5 , former international development secretary and @entity15 chief whip @entity14 demanded an arms embargo in response to the ‘ misery and carnage ’ in @entity20			1
his intervention piles further pressure on @entity24 following the @entity27 minister ’s resignation on tuesday over the government ’s position on the crisis , which she described as ‘ morally unjustifiable ’			1
a number of @entity10 backbenchers praised her ‘ principled ’ stand and said they hoped it would encourage the government to consider her call for an arms ban			2
yesterday , mr @entity14 , who was forced to resign last year over the ‘ @entity42 ’ row , became the most senior party figure yet to back @entity0			1
speaking to @entity45 ’s @entity46 , he said the current ceasefire in @entity20 must be made permanent before talks move on to addressing the wider issues in the @entity51 peace process			2
on whether there is a case for an arms embargo on @entity3 , mr @entity14 said : ‘ yes , i would have thought there is a strong case for trying to ensure that weapons getting into this conflict are minimised as much as possible			1
i think it ’s right an embargo should be considered			0
‘ on the issue of @entity20 , there is a quite extraordinary level of misery and carnage going on			2
@entity66 needs to play a role on a whole series of different levels			0
’ arms export licenses worth £ 42million have been granted to 130 @entity66 defence manufacturers to sell military equipment , including drones and armoured vehicles , to @entity3 in the past four years			1
the @entity75 are also coming under pressure from their @entity78 partners to consider an embargo on @entity3			1
@entity80 , the deputy prime minister , said he believed @entity3 has every right to defend itself from rocket attacks by @entity83 – but that its operation had ‘ overstepped the mark ’			1
he described the strikes on three @entity88 schools in @entity20 as ‘ outrageous ’ and added : ‘ that ’s why i believe that the export licences should now be suspended			2
’ party colleague @entity91 , the business secretary , said : ‘ we have been making this case inside government but have not yet been able to get agreement for this position			0
i hope and expect that to change shortly			0
’ a @entity99 spokesman said : ‘ a review of export licences to @entity3 is under way following the sustained barrage of rocket attacks from @entity20 into @entity3 which prompted @entity3 to launch @entity105			1
‘ since then no new licences have been issued for use by the @entity3 military			0
suspending export licences is not a decision we take lightly and it is right that we examine the facts fully			0
last night it was reported that @entity27 minister @entity113 had also considered quitting in protest over policy on @entity20			2
@entity116 named him as the government figure who had discussed resignation with @entity0			0
former international development secretary and @entity15 chief whip @entity14 ( above ) has demanded an arms embargo in response to the ‘ misery and carnage ’ in @entity20 but mr @entity113 denied he was ready to resign , saying : ‘ i want to be very clear – i have absolutely no intention of resigning whatsoever			1
’ announcing replacements for @entity0 , @entity99 said her title as ‘ senior minister of state ’ , which was created specially for her , would be scrapped			2
her @entity27 job will be taken by @entity130 , while her other role as faith minister will be taken over by communities secretary @entity133			0
mr @entity14 admitted on the @entity45 that @entity0 ’s resignation was ‘ undoubtedly a loss ’ , adding : ‘ she ’s a very important part of the @entity10 ’s dna			1
she reaches parts ... which others in the @entity10 do n’t reach so easily			0
’ but he suggested she should have stayed in government to argue for a tougher line on @entity3			0
‘ you should fight your corner , ’ said mr @entity14			0
‘ her voice needs to be heard			0
