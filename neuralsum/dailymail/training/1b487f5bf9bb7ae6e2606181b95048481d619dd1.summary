by @entity0 follow @ @ gedbrand10 @entity2 manager @entity1 says the club are building for a season with striker @entity5 , despite the @entity6 coming close to a move to @entity8 last month			1
@entity1 was in dire need of the 27 - year - old in front of goal during saturday 's 1 - 0 friendly defeat to @entity14 at @entity15 , the @entity2 taking 70 minutes to test the opposition goalkeeper			1
@entity5 , who may have scared off potential buyers with a failed medical at @entity19 , has been superb in training , according to @entity1			1
' he 's fine , he has trained great and his attitude has been first - class			1
i could n't have asked for more from him			0
' he 's here and he wants to work and get in the team			0
' @entity36 's own goal late on rounded off an uninspiring performance in front of a sparse crowd , but new Â£ 6millon midfielder @entity34 played the full 90 minutes on his debut			0
@entity41 and @entity42 started in a five - man defence , and looked assured enough in front of a bombardment from the @entity47 runners up to give @entity2 real hope of avoiding relegation comfortably this season			2
impressive : @entity5 scored 14 goals in 26 @entity27 games on loan at @entity54 last season @entity14 hit the post and forced two fine saves from @entity58 , with @entity60 's header , cleared off the line , representing the hosts ' best effort			1
@entity64 was tested to lead the line with @entity66 , but @entity2 fans feel another striker would round off a successful summer			2
@entity5 would be like a new signing			0
@entity1 admitted the squad was short , but insists the @entity5 situation has not affected his search in the transfer market			1
' not at all , it should n't do			0
but we need the squad , we need to strengthen			0
[ pre-season ] has n't been great , we have n't had very good games			0
' hopefully with a weeks training @entity5 will be fit to play next week			2

the @entity2 manager hopes to have @entity5 available for *selection* next weekend
after seeing a move to @entity8 collapse @entity1 says @entity5 's attitude and *application* in training has been ' first class '
*rangers* are in desperate need of *firepower* with just two strikers at the club
