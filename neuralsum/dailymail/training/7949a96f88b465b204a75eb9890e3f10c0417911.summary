by @entity0 they are the £ 250 trainers that have won a host of celebrity fans , convinced by promises that they improve posture and reduce back pain			1
but now a scientific study has shown that the @entity10 shoes favoured by stars such as @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 have no benefits for sufferers of lower back pain – and in some cases can make problems worse			1

they are said to improve balance and increase muscle sensitivity @entity10 stands for @entity30 and the shoes have a curved ‘ rocker ’ sole which is said to mimic the effect of walking without footwear on soft sand or grass			1
despite their chunky appearance , manufacturers say their health benefits include improving balance and increasing muscle activity			0
but almost two decades after they were launched in 1996 , scientists have discovered that they are no better for people with lower back pain than traditional sports shoes			2
the damning report states : ‘ rocker sole footwear has been marketed with persuasive advertising suggesting that use of this footwear leads to a reduction in low back pain			1
manufacturers claim that the unstable curved sole can positively influence mechanisms associated with chronic lower back pain , such as poor balance , sub-standard muscle function [ and ] poor posture ‘ manufacturers claim that the unstable curved sole can positively influence mechanisms associated with chronic lower back pain , such as poor balance , sub-standard muscle function [ and ] poor posture			1
‘ however , there is no evidence in the literature supporting these claims			0
’ researchers at @entity70 , @entity71 and two @entity73 hospitals recruited 115 people who suffer from chronic lower back pain to wear either a rocker sole shoe or a standard trainer for at least two hours each day while standing and walking			1
after assessing the participants , the scientists concluded : lrocker sole shoes appear to be no more beneficial than flat sole shoes in reducing pain in people with chronic lower back problems			2

celebrity fans include fitness fanatics @entity12 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) lthose given flat - soled shoes were more satisfied with their trainers than those given @entity26			0
the findings , which are due to be published in the journal spine in october , will add to the woes of @entity10 , coming just 18 months after the @entity97 parent company filed for bankruptcy			0
@entity99 , from @entity10 ’s medical academy , challenged the report ’s findings , saying that hundreds of thousands of customers had reported that their back pain had been helped by the use of the shoes			1
he said : ‘ there are many studies published in medical journals showing the benefits in balance , posture , muscle activation , blood circulation and impact absorption			0
’ he added : ‘ we always say in our claims that it “ may ” help lower back pain			2
like all health and fitness tools , for many people it does help and for some it does not			0
