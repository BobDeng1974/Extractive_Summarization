‘ people do understand that we do need to tighten our belts and be much more responsible and careful in public expenditure , ’ said the archbishop			1
‘ but i think what is happening is two things : one is that the basic safety net that was there to guarantee that people would not be left in hunger or in destitution has actually been torn apart			1
it no longer exists and that is a real , real dramatic crisis			1
' and the second is that , in this context , the administration of social assistance , i am told , has become more and more punitive			2

he wrote : ‘ i strongly refute this claim and would politely ask you to stop scaremongering in this way			0
‘ i understand that a feature of your business model must require you to continuously achieve publicity , but i ’m concerned that you are now seeking to do this by making your political opposition to welfare reform overtly clear			1
