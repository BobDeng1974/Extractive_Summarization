’ his words are a crumb of comfort for savers who have been hammered by @entity25			1
they have lost out since interest rates were slashed to 0.5 per cent in march 2009 and the @entity11 started printing money to stop recession turning into depression			2

@entity47 , at campaign group @entity46 , said : ‘ savers may give one cheer to see the back of @entity25			1

savers are still under immense pressure with little prospect of relief in sight			2
’ the @entity11 has pledged not to raise rates until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or lower – something it does not expect until late 2016			0
