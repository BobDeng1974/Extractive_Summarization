by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 8 november 2013 in a land as riddled with fakes as @entity4 , it ’s perhaps not surprising that a less - than - authentic @entity5 : the @entity7 poster ended up in the foyer of a cinema there			2
rather than showing the film ’s hero , played by @entity14 , wrapping his muscly arm around @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , it features @entity5 embracing his evil brother , @entity19 ( @entity18 )			1
the poster , while not genuine , inadvertently gave @entity22 ’s publicity campaign a huge boost , as it went viral			1
brotherly love : the fan - boy poster , left , appeared in the foyer of a @entity4 cinema			1
pictured right is the real deal @entity17 's amazing : ms @entity17 poses for the cameras at the @entity30 in @entity31 on monday at the @entity32 it was posted to @entity34 and quickly amassed hundreds of comments from amused internet users			0
some approved of the effort that had gone into the image			0
@entity40 said : ‘ it 's interesting how the fan made poster looks better than the real one			1
’ @entity45 agreed , commenting : ‘ is it just me or the poster they used look more natural than the actual poster ? ’ in the sequel to 2011 ’s smash - hit , @entity5 battles to save @entity51 and the nine realms from a shadowy enemy called @entity54 , ruler of the @entity55 of @entity56 – and tries to get his intergalactic dating with @entity16 back on track			0
but @entity54 has a super-weapon called the aether that stands in the way			0
@entity63 , as @entity64 , describes it as ‘ an ancient force of infinite destruction ’ and @entity16 as something that can ‘ tear apart the very fabric of reality ’ , so @entity5 certainly has his work cut out			0

the home - made poster shows @entity14 's character in an embrace with @entity18 's evil @entity19
