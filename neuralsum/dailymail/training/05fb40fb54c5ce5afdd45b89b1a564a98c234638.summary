@entity0 believes a @entity2 training session may have been spied on by a drone that flew over their base in @entity6 earlier this week			1
the @entity8 coach revealed at a media conference on saturday that @entity10 are investigating the incident , which left players bemused as they trained at @entity15 's @entity14 stadium			1
@entity0 lodged a complaint with @entity10 ahead of sunday 's @entity32 clash against @entity33 , with the coach seemingly concerned about the possibility that his tactics had been discovered			1
' apparently , drones are used more and more , ' he said			2
' it 's not up to me , @entity10 handle this and have been carrying out an inquiry			1
we do n't want any intrusion into our privacy but it 's very hard to fight this these days			1
' a @entity47 reporter defended the integrity of his national team			2
' it was n't us ! ' he declared			2
' no ? ' replied @entity0 with more than a little suspicion			1
' i did n't do anything special anyway that day			0
' training day : @entity8 prepare for their @entity55 opener against @entity33 even by @entity10 's standards that will be a tricky inquiry			1
one imagines , also , that communications chiefs at the world governing body might have a quiet word with @entity0 , who refused to use headphones provided to listen to questions posed to him in any language other than @entity2			1
this proved problematic when he was questioned in @entity69 about problems with player cliques at previous tournaments , such as the @entity73 in @entity74 and @entity75			0
in fairness to the @entity78 - winning captain , he has a decent command of @entity69			2
but he claimed : ' i have n't understood everything there , i did n't use my earphones			0
i heard @entity74 , and you should n't mention @entity74			0
we are now four years on			0
this is a different environment			0
' clique is a rather technical word for me			0
but we have to live life in common			0
what is important is that we 're united with a common objective			0
