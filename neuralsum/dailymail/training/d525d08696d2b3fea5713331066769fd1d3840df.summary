with sister @entity20 as office director and @entity14 , a former employee of accountancy giant @entity69 , working as business development manager , they cold - called victims promising top - end wines as a better investment than stocks and shares			0
they pretended to have offices in @entity77 , @entity78 , when in fact this was just a postal address for their actual base in @entity84 , south - east @entity85			1
once potential investors had been snared with promises of 30 per cent profits and low risk , they were sent a glossy brochure pledging the wine would be stored in a premium temperature - controlled facility in @entity11			1
between january 2007 and august 2009 , @entity8 ’s firm promised to make 39,000 bottles of fine wine , but in fact produced just a quarter of that			2

‘ with @entity132 , investors could be told the wine should n’t be sold , to increase in value , which would mean it would be a long time before they discovered they did n’t actually have any wine to sell			1
‘ with @entity140 , the wine would be sold quite quickly and the defendants had to move quickly			1
‘ £ 2million was generated in little over six months , representing something like 50 containers of wine , shipping containers used to transport by sea			2
’ but just two containers were actually purchased and shipped to @entity121			2
