by @entity0 the terminator films may have been onto something with their terrifying use of liquid - metal exoskeletons			1
in what could be precursor to the films , a @entity6 lab recently announced it has been able to use liquid metal to repair severed nerves			1
a team at @entity13 in @entity14 said the futuristic technique could someday improve current methods of nerve repair in animals and humans , while preventing long - term disabilities			1
the researchers are hoping to find out whether the liquid metal will prevent nerve repair			1
one tentative idea is to only place the liquid metal around the peripheral thick area of the nerve and then include growth factors - a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating cellular growth - in the thinner microchannels when a nerve is severed , the muscles at one end of that nerve are cut off from signals from the brain , and essentially immobilised			1
this can potentially lead to atrophy , a process in which the nerves waste away			0
to prevent this , neural signals still need to be sent from the brain over the gap in the severed nerve as it heals			1
the most common way of doing this is to use a solution of salts called @entity49 's solution that copies the function of body fluids , according to a report in @entity54			0
but metal could be a better way of conducting those signals , according to the research			0
the terminator films may have been onto something with their terrifying use of liquid - metal exoskeletons			2
in what could be precursor to the films , a @entity64 lab recently announced that it ’s been able to use liquid metal to repair severed nerves			1
pictured is @entity72 as @entity73 in the 1991 film @entity74 : @entity76 when a nerve is severed ( left ) , the muscles at one end are cut off from signals from brain and essentially immobilised			2
this can potentially lead to atrophy , causing the nerve to waste away			0
to prevent this , neural signals still need to be sent over the gap in the severed nerve as it heals			1
a healthy nerve is shown on the right scientists believe the metal is likely to work well in surgery as it remains liquid at body temperature			2
more tests are needed to see if it is safe for humans the team in @entity14 tested the liquid metal on a severed sciatic nerve connected to the calf muscle of a bullfrog			1
the sciatic nerve begins in the lower back and runs through the buttock and down the lower limb of the bullfrog			0
scientists applied a pulse to one end of the nerve and measured the signal that reached the calf muscle , which contracted with each pulse			0
they then cut the sciatic nerve and placed each of the severed ends in a capillary filled either with liquid metal or with @entity49 ’s solution			1
the pulses were re-applied and the scientists measured how they moved across the gap			0
the pulses that passed through the @entity49 ’s solution tended to degrade , while the pulses passed readily through the liquid metal			2
‘ [ @entity49 's ] solution could not be competitive with the liquid metal in the performance as functional recovery channel , ’ the researchers wrote			2
they believe that metal , known as metal alloy gallium - indium - selenium , is also likely to work well in surgery as it is liquid at body temperature			2
however , the material still needs extensive testing to see if it is safe to use in the body			0
the team now plan to make special conduits for reconnecting severed nerves that contain liquid metal			1
the researchers are also hoping to find out whether the liquid metal will prevent nerve repair in some way			1
one tentative idea is to only place the liquid metal around the peripheral thick area of the nerve and then include growth factors - a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating cellular growth - in the thinner microchannels			1
actor @entity72 famously portrayed the @entity73 , a liquid - metal robot which repaired itself			2
last year , more than 20 years after the 1991 film @entity74 was released , @entity155 scientists claimed to have developed the world 's first self - healing polymer that can spontaneously rebuild			0
the new material has been labelled ‘ terminator ’ by researchers , who said it could help improve the lifetime and security of plastic parts in anything from electrical components to houses			0
the discovery - revealed in the @entity170 - was hailed as the first polymer that restores itself without intervention , reported @entity173			0
the researchers from the @entity175 in @entity176 said that after being cut in two and the pieces pushed back together , one sample 97 per cent healed in two hours			0
the single piece was unbreakable when stretched by hand , according to scientists @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			0
they said : ‘ such a material presents near quantitative self - healing efficiency at room - temperature , without the need for any external intervention such as heat or light			0

scientists tested the liquid metal on a severed nerve in a bullfrog
it was more *effective* than current solutions at transferring electric signals
team in @entity14 hopes the technique could improve current methods of nerve repair while preventing long - term disabilities
further tests need to be done before the alloy can be tested on humans
