archaeologists have unearthed an ancient bathtub in a first - century mansion that could have belonged to one of the priests who was responsible for @entity6 ' death , while another expedition has found a town where @entity6 is believed to have stayed following the feeding of the 5,000 miracle			1
the mansion , which houses the bathtub and is situated on @entity13 in @entity14 , would have belonged to wealthy owners , signified by its size and features such as intricate carvings , a luxurious oven and the bathtub , which is similar to others found in @entity24 's palace and a priest 's residence			1
archaeologists believe the mansion , which was built close to the walls of the @entity30 erected by @entity24 , could have been home to one of @entity6 ' archenemies - a man belonging to the @entity35 class , which was typically wealthy , powerful and allied with the @entity36			1
archaeologists have unearthed an ancient bathtub ( pictured ) in a first - century mansion			2
the bathtub is the biggest clue as to who lived in the house as two similar tubs were unearthed in @entity46 's palaces at @entity47 and @entity48 , while a third was located at a priestly residence also in @entity14 the building is an example of an early @entity54 period mansion , which historians hope will yield plenty of domestic details abut the ruling classes of @entity14 at the time of @entity6			1
@entity60 , who specialises in early @entity62 history at the @entity63 at @entity64 , told @entity65 : ' we might be digging in the home of one of @entity6 ' archenemies			1
' @entity69 , who is leading the expedition , believes the house could have belonged to the high priest @entity73 or @entity74 but they were both members of the ruling priest class			0
these ruins could be a mansion that was inhabited by one of the priests that condemned @entity6 to death , according to archaeologists			1
the ruins are located on @entity14 's @entity13 close to the walls of the old city the bathtub is the biggest clue as to who lived in the mansion as two similar tubs were unearthed in @entity46 's palaces at @entity47 and @entity48 , while a third was located at a priest 's house also in @entity14			1
it is buried in a vaulted chamber adjacent to a large underground ritual cleansing pool called a mikveh and is only the fourth bathroom of its kind to be found in @entity102			1
dr @entity69 said : ' it is only a stone 's throw away , and i would n't hesitate to say that the people who made that bathroom probably were the same ones who made this one			0
it 's almost identical , not only in the way it 's made , but also in the finishing touches , like the edge of the bath itself			0
' the location of the mansion is a strong indication of a high - status resident			0
the bathtub was found in a vaulted chamber adjacent to a large underground ritual cleansing pool called a mikveh ( pictured )			1
@entity126 is known about the daily lives of priests at the time and archaeologists hope to build up a better picture of their lives from the newly - discovered mansion dr @entity60 said : ' whoever lived in this house would have been a neighbor and would have been able to pop into the palace			2
' if this turns out to be the priestly residence of a wealthy first century @entity142 family , it immediately connects not just to the elite of @entity14 – the aristocrats , the rich and famous of that day – but to @entity6 himself			1
' these are the families who had @entity6 arrested and crucified , so for us to know more about them and their domestic life and the level of wealth that they enjoyed , would really fill in for us some key history			2
' the team hopes to learn more about the household activities that might have been undertaken by priests at the time , as there are very few historical reports about their activities outside the holy temples in @entity14			2
dr @entity60 also believes that the details of the first - century @entity142 ruling class could provide fresh insights into @entity165 history			0
the mansion would have belonged to wealthy owners , signified by its size and features such as intricate carvings and a luxurious oven ( pictured )			0
archaeologists believe the mansion could have been home to one of @entity6 ' archenemies - a man belonging to the @entity35 class he said : ' @entity6 , in fact , criticises the wealth of this class			1
he talks about their clothing and their long robes and their finery and in a sense , pokes fun at it			0
so for us to get closer to understanding that , to supplement the text , could be really fascinating			0
' the archaeologists also found plenty of animal bones and cooking pots inside a cistern some 10 metres deep , which could have become a makeshift hiding place for @entity142 residents during the @entity54 siege that led to the @entity201 's destruction in @entity202			1
a @entity54 historian said over 2,000 bodies were found underground in similar cisterns and many of the occupants had died of starvation			0
dr @entity69 said : ' we still need to look at this material very carefully and be absolutely certain of our conclusions , but it might be that these are the remnants of a kitchen in use by @entity142 hiding from the @entity36 -- their last resort was to go into these cisterns			0
the archaeologists also found plenty of animal bones and cooking pots inside a cistern some 10 metres deep , which could have become a makeshift hiding place for @entity142 residents during the @entity54 siege that led to the @entity201 's destruction in @entity202 ' it was a common practice , but this conclusion is theoretical			1
it makes for a very good story and it does look that way , but we ’ve got to be certain			0
' archaeologists believe this particular residence survived because of its location after the city was ruined			1
@entity13 was left unoccupied until around 400 ad and the beginning of the @entity232 period , when people simply built on top of older walls			1
around 200 years later dr @entity69 believes what remained of the house was covered with landfill material from the construction of a church called @entity241 of the @entity242 near the site			0
he said : ' the area got submerged			0
the early @entity232 reconstruction of these two - story @entity247 houses then got buried under rubble and soil fills			2
then they established buildings above it			0
that 's why we found an unusually well - preserved set of stratigraphic levels			2

archaeologists found pottery remains , tesserae and architectural fragments indicating a town flourished in the area from the second or first century bc. they think @entity6 could have rested after performing the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 at an ancient town near this site a separate group of @entity259 have uncovered an ancient town on the northwest coast of the @entity272 , which they believe was where @entity6 rested after performing the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 , where he is said to have fed a large group of people with less than seven loaves of bread and two fish			1
the town is 2,000 - years - old , situated in @entity102 's @entity258 and is thought to be ' @entity282 ' , which is described in the @entity283 as the location of @entity6 ' next journey after the miracle , @entity280 reported			1
the town is only mentioned once in the @entity283 , which states that after feeding 5,000 people @entity6 sailed to @entity282 , where he was questioned by the @entity290 and aked to provide a sign from heaven			1
@entity54 column fragments lying on the side of a road in the modern - day town of @entity297 are thought to be part of a newfound ancient town			0
locals use artefacts as garden ornaments in the modern town @entity304 , of the @entity305 , who led the archaeological team , believes the town was prosperous in ancient times due to the vessel glasses and amphora discovered			2
the team said a 2,000 - year - old boat found in 1986 on a shoreline nearby , adds to the picture of a thriving town			2
writing in the journal @entity318 , he said : ' stone anchors along with the access to beaches suitable for landing boats and of course , the first - century boat … all imply an involvement with fishing '			0
the team thinks the town survived for a number of centuries as hundreds of pieces of pottery from as early as the first century @entity333 as well as later pieces from the @entity335 were scattered between the modern town of @entity297 and the coast			2
they also found cubes called tesserae associated with @entity142 practices in the early @entity54 period , suggesting a @entity142 community lived there , as well as basalt ashlar blocks used as garden ornaments in the modern town , which they believe were found in the local area and probably the newly - discovered town			0
key finds include @entity350 column pieces and a pagan altar made of light grey limestone .			0
