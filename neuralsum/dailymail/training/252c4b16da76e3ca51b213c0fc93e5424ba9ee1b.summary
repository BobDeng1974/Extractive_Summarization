electrical skin shocks to treat autistic patients who are self - harming may soon be banned in a @entity3 school			1
the @entity4 is considering whether to stop the shock devices used by the @entity6 in @entity7			1
self - injury is one of the most difficult behaviors associated with autism and other developmental or intellectual disabilities			1
some of the patients at the private facility outside @entity15 cut themselves while others slam their heads against walls or desks - one girl did it so hard she detached both retinas while another patient pulled out all his teeth			1
pictured : a therapist checks the ankle strap of a shocking device on student @entity31 at the @entity6 in @entity7 @entity31 , who was born with a developmental disorder , wears the device to control violent episodes the facility , which takes on some of the hardest - to - treat cases , is the only place in the country known to use skin shocks as aversive conditioning for aggressive patients			1
the review is a rare move by the @entity4 , following years of complaints from disability rights ' groups and even a @entity48 report that the shocks are tantamount to torture			1
@entity4 commissioner @entity51 says the shock therapy has raised a lot of questions			1
with the remote control of a shock device hanging from his belt , a therapist watches as a physical education teacher helps student @entity31 ( pictured ) on a treadmill during an exercise program @entity62 of @entity63 , @entity3 , says the skin shocks are the only treatment that has worked for her son , @entity31 , ( both pictured ) who suffered brain damage at birth and became dangerously aggressive as he got older @entity69 must get a court 's approval to begin administering skin shocks to a student ' we really wanted to take a much more focused and rigorous look at it , ' @entity51 said in an interview with the @entity78			1
' there 's a lot of concern about the downside of this approach and the harm and the risk to the patients receiving it			1
' @entity69 must get a court 's approval to begin administering skin shocks to a student			1
the center uses a graduated electronic decelerator , or ged , that is attached to the arms or legs			2
aversion therapy is a controversial form of therapy which is based on the premise that certain types of behaviour can be avoided if those displaying it associate it with an unpleasant feeling			2
this form of encouraging ' learnt behaviour ' , as made famous in the @entity109 novel @entity108 , has received much criticism over the years			0
questions have been raised over how effective the treatment is over the long - term while others have raised serious ethical concerns			2
according to @entity117 , it is unclear why the shocks have certain effects , while the treatment is also believed to be less effective in the outside world away from the therapist			2
it is also said to have a high relapse rate			0
if the student acts aggressively — head - banging , throwing furniture , attacking someone — then a center worker can press a button to activate the electrode , delivering a two - second shock to the skin			1
some patients compared the shocks to a hard pinch or bee sting			1
others say it 's far more painful ; one said it was like being stung by a thousand bees			0
at an @entity4 advisory committee hearing this year , most of the neurology and ethics experts concluded the device poses an unreasonable and substantial risk , while acknowledging that other therapies do n't work for everyone			1
' i think that what has happened is that this has gone on for this long because this is a population who can not adequately speak for themselves , ' dr. @entity149 , a clinical psychologist affiliated with the @entity150 's @entity151 , told fellow committee members			0
dr. @entity160 , a bioethicist at the @entity161 , was one of several advisers concerned about the lack of scientific studies showing the shock therapy works			0
that only one treatment facility uses them , he said , makes it ' unreasonable to conclude that these devices are part of the standard of care for this class of patients			1
' but @entity62 of @entity63 , @entity3 , says the skin shocks are the only treatment that has worked for her son , @entity31 , who suffered brain damage at birth and became dangerously aggressive as he got older			1
@entity31 spent years at a @entity181 facility , where his mother says he bit , hit and kicked staff members			2
when restraints did not work , workers tried medications to calm him			0
' he was a zombie , ' @entity62 said			0
therapist @entity188 comforts a student , who is wearing a waist pack holding a shocking device			0
many students at the school , who were born with @entity194 and development disorders , wear shocking devices to control violent outbreaks a female student , wearing a shocking device on her leg , lines up with classmates after lunch he was kicked out at age 19 and taken to @entity69 , which weaned him from some medications and began the skin shocks			1
now , at 33 , @entity31 still gets a shock or two every month , but his mom says his life is better			0
he 's happy and he 's functioning to the best of his abilities , ' @entity62 said in an interview			0
' we have our son back			0
' @entity69 's executive director , @entity218 , calls the shocks a last resort coupled with positive behavior programs , such as rewarding students with time at @entity224 's internet cafe or the teen lounge with its arcade games			2
the idea is that the two - second shock is quick but painful enough to jar the patient out of the harmful episode			2
of the 235 patients at the center , 55 are being treated with skin shocks			1
most are in their 30s ; five are between age 17 and 21			0
the @entity4 first cleared the ged device for use in 1994			1
but @entity69 started using a more powerful version , about 2.5 times stronger , that was developed after one student built up a tolerance to the shocks			2
in 2000 , the @entity4 said the newer device did n't need approval , but the agency changed its position in 2011 and said approval was required , eventually leading to april 's hearing on whether to ban it altogether			1
@entity252 sued the center for malpractice after her autistic son , @entity255 , was shocked more than 30 times over approximately seven hours in 2002			0

it does n't feel safe			0
i ended up having nightmares , ' @entity264 , 38 , ( pictured ) testified via video at the @entity4 's hearing			1
she said the ged left burn marks and was prone to misfires , unintended shocks the center insists it is safe , but some former students say otherwise			2

it does n't feel safe			0

@entity264 's mother is suing @entity224			0
her attorney says @entity264 , who has autism , was given more than 230 electrical shock treatments since 2002 and not permitted to take psychiatric medications			2
@entity264 said she is less anxious at a new treatment facility in @entity291			2
' they help figure out what makes me want to do things that could be harmful so i can learn how i feel before it happens , ' @entity264 told the @entity78 @entity69 representatives says the suit has no merit and that ' @entity264 made incredible progress ' at the center			0
about 10 percent of people with intellectual disabilities or autism display self - injurious behavior			1
severity varies widely and treatment should be individualized , said dr. @entity308 , program director of the neurobehavioral unit at @entity311 's @entity310			0
@entity308 was not part of the @entity4 panel reviewing skin shocks			1
the most studied approach - behavioral treatment - involves identifying what social or environmental factors trigger a patient 's behavior , and then teaching the person coping skills plus altering their environment to decrease those problematic situations			2
@entity308 said medications that address mood , impulsiveness and other conditions also frequently are used			0
@entity264 's suit is not the first			0

he can be heard screaming , ' help me			0
no. ' the center settled the suit			0
the center says that ' is not the same treatment approach @entity224 would take today			0
' @entity218 , the center 's executive director , said skin shocks would be suspended earlier and the center would take a closer look at potential triggers of aggression			1
@entity353 of @entity354 , @entity355 , fears a ban on skin shocks would return her 21 - year - old son , @entity357 , to the violent behavior that used to force her to lock herself in a room with her young daughter			1
his parents say they tried everything but the only thing that worked was the shocks			2
' do not take away what is saving his life , ' @entity353 said in an interview as the @entity4 considers the ban			1
' do n't take this away until you are convinced there are better alternatives			0

the @entity4 is considering whether to ban devices used by the @entity6 in @entity7
the facility takes on some of the hardest - to - treat cases
