by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 8 june 2013 an orchestra stuck on board a delayed plane decided to pass the time with an impromptu performance - much to the delight of their fellow passengers			1
members of the @entity10 found themselves stuck on the tarmac for three hours while they waited for their flight from @entity13 to @entity14			1
so four of them decided to treat their fellow - passengers to a movement from a string quartet by @entity19			1
' the four then gave a rendition of the finale of @entity19 's @entity42 as their audience stood up and filmed them on phones and tablets			0
despite the cramped conditions , and half way through , one passenger 's phone ringing , the four raced through the movement 's energetic phrases flawlessly			0
first class entertainment : the four played to a sea of mobile phones , one of which went off midway through the performance fellow - passengers held the music for them in the absence of music stands			2
at one point the cameraman rotated the device the four were being filmed on , and the picture did not auto correct			0
at the of the performance the captive audience responded with cheers and rapturous applause			0

@entity10 's @entity13 to @entity14 flight was delayed by three hours
musicians took *opportunity* to treat fellow passengers to *inflight* show
