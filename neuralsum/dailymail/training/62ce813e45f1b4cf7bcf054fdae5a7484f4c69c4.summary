by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 15 august 2013 @entity2 : 17:48 est , 16 august 2013 it was hardly the reunion @entity5 had imagined when he waved his daughter @entity6 off to @entity7 seven weeks earlier			1
in a police station in distant @entity9 , he tries to comfort his distraught child , stroking her hair and kissing her head as she sobs into his chest			1
she can not hug him back because her hands are cuffed			2
when he sees the chains around her wrists , he breaks down too			2
police officers believe they were knowingly involved in smuggling , which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in jail			1
the women claim @entity30 gangsters forced them to act as drug mules			1
exhausted from travel , mr @entity5 confesses it takes him a few seconds to realise it is his child rushing towards him			1
her face is thin , there are deep bags under her eyes and she is almost unrecognisable from the happy , tanned teenager he saw in the photographs of her holiday she posted on @entity44			2
today @entity6 turns 20 , but there will be no celebrations at @entity50 ’s maximum security @entity48 police station , where mr @entity5 , 54 , was allowed only 15 minutes with his daughter on wednesday night			1

@entity6 claims @entity30 gangsters took her from @entity7 to @entity92 in @entity93 , and then @entity90			2
at least one gang member escorted her on each flight			2
physically shaking , @entity6 tells her father : ‘ they made me do it			2
’ but as he breaks down , she tells him soothingly ‘ i know @entity100 ’ and reaches for his hand			2
she talks quickly as she tells him how one of her new female friends in @entity7 had introduced her to a charming @entity104 man who gave his name as @entity106			0
she said he had seemed ‘ really nice and friendly ’ , and he came back to the apartment she shared with a close friend from home , 20 - year - old @entity108			2
there , she claimed , he became aggressive			0
‘ i felt really scared because i was alone in the flat			0
he told me i had to come and meet some of his friends and pressured me to get into a taxi			0
’ then she was bundled into a flat and confronted by a group of @entity30 gangsters , who put a gun to her head			0
she says : ‘ i could feel the metal against my temple			0
i thought they were going to kill me			0
they said they knew all about me and my family			0
i was so scared they were going to hurt them if i did n’t do as i was told			0
i did n’t know they wanted me to take drugs or money or guns at that point			0

they were kept captive in a flat , she said , then flown to @entity50 separately			1
officers suspect they were recruited by a cartel allegedly operated from behind bars by @entity147 , the nephew of singer @entity148			0
the 38 - year - old was arrested in @entity9 last year after £ 3million worth of cocaine was found on a yacht he and two other @entity104 men were trying to sail across the @entity154			1
during the first visit , @entity6 tells her father : ‘ i wanted to tell the air hostesses or anyone in the airports , but the men said they would know if we had spoken to anyone , that they were watching all the time			0
‘ it was a choice between doing what i was told and getting it over and done with and hopefully getting back to @entity77 or trying to escape and being killed			1
’ the two women are in separate concrete cells , but are able to communicate when they visit the shared bathroom			0
@entity6 says she is ‘ freezing ’ at night , but that staff are treating them well			0

as she talks to her father about her fears , a detective tells her that she must return to her cell			0
mr @entity5 quickly gives her a few comforts he and his wife chose from her bedroom at home – a navy blue spotted onesie from @entity194 , a pink fleece and her grey @entity197			1
she puts them on immediately			0
coerced : @entity133 , left , and @entity22 , right , say they were forced into carrying drugs by a violent gang who threatened their families the father and daughter look anguished as she stands up to leave and mr @entity5 whispers in her ear : ‘ we will do everything we can to get you out of here			1
we will work something out			0
’ as they separate , armed guards lead @entity6 down to her cell and she shouts to her father , ‘ i need to learn @entity77 ’			1
as the metal doors leading to the prison shut , she shouts : ‘ i love you dad ’			0
