a fifth expectant mother has died giving birth at a hospital already under investigation after four other women died in similar circumstances			2
a new probe is today under way at @entity8 in @entity9 , east @entity10 , instigated following the latest death last month			1
@entity12 was called in last summer to assist an internal review into how the first four mothers died within a space of eight months			2
such deaths are extremely rare - therefore it is unusual for a single hospital to have so many deaths in a short period			1
in the whole of @entity12 and @entity23 in 2013 there were just 47 maternal deaths during pregnancy , childbirth and the six - week period following birth - out of almost 700,000 deliveries			1
a fifth expectant mother has died at @entity8 , it has emerged			0
a new investigation is now under way at the east @entity10 trust			1
it comes after a series of probes following the deaths of four other women in similar circumstances over eight months from july 2013 to april last year @entity8 has already been the subject of one internal review , another by the health watchdog , the @entity41 and a further by the @entity42 and @entity43			1
the investigations came following persistent allegations from an anonymous group of whistleblowing midwives raising concerns over ' avoidable ' deaths of mothers and babies at the maternity department			1
the first four deaths occurred in july and october 2013 , and january and april 2014			1
the latest death , the fifth , is believed to have followed an elective caesarean section			2
the mother died on january 17 , and a spokesman for @entity8 said the matter ' is in the hands of the coroner '			1
the hospital added the case would not be included in its internal review into the other four deaths , which is not yet complete			0
it has also not revealed details of any of the cases , citing confidentiality and ' potentially identifiable patient information '			0
a group who dub themselves the ' unhappy midwives ' flagged up concerns two years ago			0
they referenced several unspecified serious incidents at the hospital , claiming women and babies were being exposed to poor standards of care and a culture of racial discrimination			0
results of an independent investigation by the @entity42 and @entity86 ( @entity87 ) published in september concluded none of the allegations could be substantiated and did not identify any failings in the standard of care			0
but an unabridged copy of the report leaked to the @entity94 made urgent recommendations			0
it refers to an under - staffing of consultants and supervisor midwives , and the extraordinary fact no obstetricians were available to undertake an analysis following any major incident			0
the report states that serious events were not referred for further scrutiny ' that may have enabled the service to detect themes with incidents or individuals involved '			0
maternal deaths in childbirth are very rare			1
in @entity12 and @entity23 in 2013 there were 47 such deaths in total it adds : ' in at least three cases that were reviewed the statements described missing equipment or inadequate rooms that could have an impact on the care provided			1
' at the beginning of an investigation in october 2013 , the trust was advised to consider informing the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) of serious incidents			2
however the report points out that in early january 2014 - by which time three maternal deaths had occurred - it had not informed the @entity127			1
a spokesman for the trust said it was investigating the latest death which had been reported to the ' appropriate authorities '			2
a spokesman for @entity42 and @entity87 said : ' as commissioner for maternity services , @entity42 and @entity87 takes its role and responsibilities extremely seriously , which is why it requested a full and independent review of the allegations made by the @entity143			0
' the investigation found no failings in the standard of maternity care at @entity8 although there were some recommendations for improvement			2
' these are being closely monitored by the @entity87 's @entity152			0
' any maternal death is extremely saddening and the @entity87 will work closely with the @entity154 to implement any recommendations of the recent review that was carried out by @entity12 at the request of @entity8			1
' our overriding concern is , and always will be , to ensure that women receive the best care possible			0
