in the search for meaning and importance , the @entity0 might have found its saviour			1
enter @entity5 and @entity6 , a club and manager not just popping into the party to say a polite hello and a quick goodbye			1
tonight , against @entity12 at @entity13 , @entity6 faces one of those defining moments in a season that has not lacked them			1
his only hope must be that this time it does n't go so horribly wrong			0
so far it has been a theme of the campaign that when the need was greatest , so too have been the disappointments			0
he loaded for duck on a bear hunt in the @entity27 against @entity28 and lost			2
he wanted to save his best resources for @entity30 and lost that game , too			0
@entity32 found the net in @entity5 's @entity0 clash with @entity12 but his effort was ruled out @entity12 salute their fans at @entity37 after earning a @entity39 replay at home to the @entity42 side when the @entity44 portion of their season fizzled out , first in the big show and then in the @entity47 , the @entity42 offered an opportunity			1
getting into the top - four without @entity49 and often in the absence of @entity51 would be an immense achievement			2
having started the season so badly and recovered so impressively , it became a real possibility			0
then two huge games - @entity57 and @entity58			0
@entity60 lost his mind , the defence lost the plot and @entity5 lost by a combined total of 6 - 2 across the two games			1
a top - four place is virtually gone , unless anyone can conceivably see them making up seven points and a massive goal difference on @entity71			2
suddenly , the romance of the @entity0 is a little more two - sided			1
@entity60 's birthday falls on may 30 , the same day as the @entity0 final at @entity77 the @entity0 represents @entity5 's last chance of silverware after a disappointing season ' i do n't want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season , ' said @entity6 before the replay of their quarter - final against @entity12			1
' our objective at the start , though , was to win a trophy			0
' so i think if we did n't get in the top four and we did n't have a trophy this year , we would be disappointed			2
i think certainly the @entity0 would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club			1
' that 's the expectancy we want			2
we want to be able to be challenging every year			0
' that was the key thing for me , to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies			2
the @entity0 would mark a good step forward for us			1
' the need for trophies has been a dominant theme since @entity6 took over at @entity5 and made them contenders again			1
there is no denying the steps he has taken with the club and very little to suggest he is anything other than one of the sharpest managerial minds working in this country			0
@entity51 will be crucial to @entity5 's chances of reaching the @entity0 semi-final @entity119 is in good spirits in training ahead of @entity5 's trip to @entity13 on wednesday but how he will be tested if this season ends without either a top - four place or a trophy			1
@entity125 rather helpfully alluded to the need for the latter recently			0
that tricky contract situation has not gone away and it is less likely to have a happy ending for @entity5 if they ca n't present a silver argument to @entity125 in the summer			1
the same goes for potential new arrivals			0
@entity6 can talk magnificently and persuasively but his sales pitches to leading players would be enhanced immeasurably if he could talk about current achievements			1
something shiny and tangible and recently acquired would help			0
it 's a tough ask			0
they face @entity12 with a defence looking as woefully shaky as it did at the start of the season			2
without @entity141 and @entity142 tonight that defence could be vulnerable again			0
not ideal , though not necessarily a tremendous setback against a @entity146 side			0
in any case , @entity5 and @entity6 need to find a way through			1
it has been three years since they last won a trophy â€“ under @entity151 - and the @entity0 is a chance to stop the clock			1
it 's a defining moment that must not end in another failure			0
@entity5 have not won a trophy since they beat @entity157 to win the @entity158 three years ago @entity28 1 - 0 @entity5 , november 4 finally back on the grandest stage , but @entity6 opted for a watered down xi. @entity160 , @entity60 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 played all previous @entity27 matches but none of them started			1
the aim , it appeared , was to prioritise the following league game			0
@entity172 celebrates scoring for @entity28 against @entity5 at the @entity173 @entity5 1 - 2 @entity30 , november 8 it was time to vindicate the gamble in @entity28 , which was widely criticised			2
@entity6 made seven changes to the side that lost in the @entity27 and @entity142 put them ahead			1
but @entity30 won 2 - 1 , leaving @entity5 eighth in the @entity42			2
having rested a host of players in @entity28 , @entity6 ' side then lost a crunch league game to @entity30 @entity30 1 - 0 @entity5 , january 27 after drawing the first leg of their @entity158 semi-final , @entity5 blew a host of chances and fell to a stoppage - time winner			1
the @entity189 also knocked @entity5 out of the @entity158 following a 1 - 0 win at home @entity192 1 - 0 @entity5 , february 26 ten years after their @entity27 miracle in @entity194 , @entity5 returned to face @entity192 in the @entity47 last 32			2
they held a 1 - 0 first - leg lead			0
it went horribly wrong and they lost on penalties			0
' unfortunately , on this occasion , @entity194 is not a happy place , ' said @entity6 @entity200 celebrates after @entity160 missed the crucial penalty in the shoot - out against @entity192 @entity58 4 - 1 @entity5 , april 4 @entity5 's last real shot at getting into the top four and it fell apart spectacularly			1
@entity125 's unauthorised interview hardly helped matters in the build - up and the game was a disaster			0
they were 3 - 0 down at half - time and ultimately repeated the kind of defensive inadequacies that hurt them earlier in the campaign			0
@entity216 curls home @entity58 's second in their 4 - 1 win over @entity5 in the @entity42 last weekend			1

@entity5 take on @entity12 in their @entity222 replay tonight
the competition represents the @entity37 club 's last chance of success
@entity6 ' side are all but out of the race for the top four
@entity5 also endured poor campaigns in both @entity44 campaigns
@entity235 : @entity0 hunt must not be all about @entity60
