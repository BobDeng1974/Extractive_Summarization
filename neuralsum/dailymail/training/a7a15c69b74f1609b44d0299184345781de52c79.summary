wildlife researches have charted a grizzly bear 's astonishing three - year , 2,800 - mile trek through backyards , down main streets and up mountains - in what they have deemed a ' bizarre ' journey			2
@entity9 the grizzly bear was captured raiding an apple orchard in @entity11 , @entity12 in 2012 and was fitted with a radio collar that sent gps data to a satellite once a week			1
after she got her new collar , she was relocated 50 miles away to @entity19 of the @entity20 because her previous home was not deemed safe , researchers told @entity22			1
what they gathered from the gps data over the next three years astonished them			0
' she had some really bizarre travels			0
' @entity22 reported that these ' bizarre ' movements were prompted by her move to an unknown place			0
but if she indeed was trying to get back home , she took the scenic route			2
the incredible data shows that she headed south to the @entity56 and @entity57 - which is about 120 miles from her starting point - before heading another 120 miles south to the @entity60 and eventually into @entity30			1
she then headed 200 miles north to pass the towns of @entity62 and @entity63 , where she hibernated - but not before the @entity63 newspaper reported a sighting of her near the town 's high school			1
spotted : the daring bear walked through backyards , around downtown areas and across highways journey : her journey - which has left researchers baffled - is extremely unusual for a female grizzly bear after waking up again , she headed to @entity78 , @entity12 and towards the small town of @entity80			1
when she arrived , she wandered downtown - right through the streets and backyards - into landfills and across @entity84 but astonishingly there were no reported sightings of her , @entity22 reported			0
' she was minding her own business , walking around trying to figure out where she is , ' @entity43 said			0
on one occasion , she nearly made it back home but instead missed it and headed to @entity94 and then headed west again			2
she eventually lost her collar on october 17			1
' the area and terrain she covered was pretty significant , ' @entity96 , a researcher with the @entity97 , told @entity22			0
' she just was n't travelling on flat ground			0
she made huge crossings across mountains , rivers , and even towns			0
' @entity9 ( like the grizzly bear pictured ) eventually lost her collar in october but officials hope to find her again she added that researchers hope to find @entity9 - who was named after the owner of the apple orchard where she was first found in 2006 and then 2012 - and check in on her			1
speaking to the @entity46 , conversationalists said that while they can not be 100 per cent sure why @entity9 went on her ramble , the tracking has taught them that the beasts can co-exist with people			2
officials believe @entity9 , who was found with a two - year - old cub when she was captured and tagged in 2012 , is in her 20s			1
grizzly bears live until up to about 30 years .			0

@entity9 was fitted with a radio collar after she was found raiding an apple orchard in 2012 and the trek she took afterwards stunned researchers
over the next three years , she walked for nearly *3,000* miles across state parks in @entity12 before heading into @entity30 and wandering through towns
she eventually headed back to @entity12 but lost her collar in october
some *experts* have *suggested* that she might have walked so far in a *bid* to get home after being relocated - but the trek has researchers *stumped*
