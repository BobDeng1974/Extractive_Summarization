ever since his aging @entity2 broke down a decade ago and he could n't afford a replacement , 56 - year - old @entity0 has been making 21 miles of his daily commute to his factory job on foot			1
but not being able to afford a vehicle is n't a problem any more - after $ 230,000 of donations poured in to an online fund to get him a new ride			1
@entity13 touched by images of @entity0 battling through the snow on his daily reached for their wallets to help out the dedicated worker , whose intimidating commute never stops him making it in for his $ 10.55 - an - hour wage			1
as only part of his journey is covered by bus routes , he puts in 21 of the 46 - miles round trip on foot			1
he walks eight on his way in way in , while on the way home he faces a 13 - mile trek , since some services have finished			0
however , the punishing , all - weather hikes now look like a thing of the past for @entity0 , whose surging total on a @entity28 donations page passed $ 230,000 tuesday evening			1
that amount of cash in the bank could get @entity55 some of the flashiest motors on the market - including a convertible @entity58 ( around $ 138,000 ) , a @entity59 ( $ 132,000 ) , or , at a push , a @entity61 ( from $ 181,000 )			2
@entity62 : @entity0 has a perfect attendance record at work , and has battled heat , rain and cold alike to make it on time for the past 12 years tough life : @entity0 takes a bus for just over half of his 46 - mile - a - day trek , but still puts in almost half on foot but the machine operator , who said in an interview with the @entity78 that @entity13 manufacturers are more his style , has said all he wants is a @entity31 , which will set him back some $ 27,000			1
he said : ' i 'm a @entity82 fan			0
they look comfortable , nothing fancy			0
they 're simple on the outside , strong on the inside — like me '			0
' i 'm 6 - foot and i think the @entity88 's a little tight , ... i mostly stay with @entity13 cars - @entity90 , @entity82 , @entity91 , @entity92			2
' the fundraising campaign for @entity0 was started by @entity29 , 19 - year - old college junior who read his story and decided to raise money for him - initially with a $ 5,000 goal			1
over just two days , 6,750 people have donated , with individual contributions as high as $ 2,000			0
moment of rest : in the above photo , @entity0 stops to pray during a break at the factory in the @entity24 suburb of @entity105 where he works @entity29 and @entity0 met monday night at a bar in @entity105 , @entity25 , ahead of a round of national press interviews			2
at the encounter , @entity0 said : ' i 'm always going to be in your debt — i will never forget this			2
' the teen responded by showing him some comments left alongside the donations - many of which said that he deserved the money for his decades of hard work			2
although the fund was originally just meant to get @entity55 - whose last ride was a decrepit @entity2 which gave up in 2005 - a new set of wheels , the fund could now do much more			2
as well as the car itself - which some local dealers have offered to give to him for nothing - the cash is likely to help with medical and dental expenses , as well as longer - term commuting expenses like gas , repairs and insurance			0
the interviews and meeting were orchestrated by @entity139 , a @entity140 banker who saw @entity0 's commute , sometimes gave him lifts , and first told the press about him			0
the finance expert has now assembled a group of advisers to manage the ever - growing fund , which is now 17,500 times larger than his annual wage - or equivalent to eight and a half years ' work			0
breaking the bank : @entity61 ( $ 181,000 ) should @entity0 want to spend most his $ 230,000 windfall at once , he could just about nose his way into the elite ranks of @entity155 owners			1
the entry - level @entity61 ( below ) sells for just over $ 180,000 , leaving a little spare cash for gas			0
a touch of @entity161 class : @entity58 ( $ 138,000 ) if style is more of a concern for @entity0 than out - and - out cost , the @entity161 - made @entity58 , the slightly more affordable cousin on @entity164 cars like the @entity165 , sells for just shy of $ 140,000			1
@entity169 : the @entity170 while not quite the range - topping ride which his budget allows for , the @entity170 ( below ) , does have the advantage of coming from one of @entity177			0
it could be his for as little as $ 85,000			0
' @entity180 ' , the @entity181 : @entity31 ( $ 27,000 ) despite the sizable fund now on offer , @entity0 said that he only wants a modest car - and is seemingly set on a @entity31 , shown below at a 2011 motor show in @entity186 .			1

@entity0 , 56 , has been walking to work in @entity24 since 2005
he catches a bus part of the way , but still puts in 21 miles on foot
after his story was revealed this *weekend* , donations for new car *flooded* in
@entity55 now has $ 230,000 to play with - enough for a @entity155
but he has said a @entity31 , which costs $ 27,000 , is more his style
