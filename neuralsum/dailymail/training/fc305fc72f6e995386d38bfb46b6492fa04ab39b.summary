@entity1 ’s potential mega-fight with @entity2 could take place in the @entity4			1
reports have claimed that a group of investors in the @entity8 have put around £ 70million up to help facilitate hosting the fight in @entity10			1
after years of posturing , it seems that the super-fight could be edging closer with may 2015 being the target date for the two superstars of boxing to finally get in the ring together			2
@entity2 waves to his fans during his victory parade in @entity21 following his win over @entity23 @entity2 looked excellent during his win over @entity23 ( left ) @entity1 ’s hometown of @entity26 is one of the favourites to host the fight , but @entity2 ’s last fight against @entity23 was held in the @entity32 city of @entity33 and that could also be another option for the fight			1
but @entity10 has emerged as a potential third host for the fight			1
the @entity4 has never hosted anything of this size in the past and the time difference between @entity10 and @entity43 would have to be factored in			2
@entity44 and @entity45 famously fought in @entity46 40 years ago and @entity47 beat @entity48 in @entity49 in 2001			0
but rarely do mega-fights such as this happen outside @entity43			0
but that has not stopped the @entity4 group talking up their chances of hosting the fight			0
@entity1 ( left ) is unlikely to want to fight outside @entity43 @entity1 is undefeated in his 47 fights @entity57 outclasses @entity58 to retain title spokesman for the group , @entity60 told @entity63 : ‘ the funding is in place , and because of this and the group ’s unique and distinctive make - up and backgrounds , it has emerged as the leading and most serious group striving to secure the bout			1
i ’ve been instructed by the group to do whatever it takes to bring this long - awaited and eagerly - anticipated fight to fruition			0
‘ there ’s absolutely no doubt that each fighter , individually , will receive more money than any other boxer has in the past			0
the combined purses are approaching $ 200million ( £ 127m )			0
and , rest assured , we have the resources to do just that			0
‘ we want to be a part of mr @entity1 ’s historic march to 50 - 0 , no matter where the fights may take place			2
’ since his win at the end of last month over @entity94 , @entity2 has been keen to talk up the prospect of a fight with @entity1			1
@entity2 took to @entity97 to say : ‘ stop throwing punches on @entity97 and let 's get in the ring ! # @entity102 # @entity101 ’			2
