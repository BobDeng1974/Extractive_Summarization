however they did not provide a proof of life			0
when they stopped calling , @entity37 's source could not contact them as he had no phone number for the captors			0
he did not reveal how much money had been handed over			0
according to @entity82 ' @entity81 , dr @entity10 and mr @entity18 may have been used to safeguard an @entity6 leader while they were in the compound			1
@entity3 officials have not revealed a specific individual that was targeted during the attacks , but said the compound was hit because intelligence strongly suggested militants were inside			1
the senior member of the terrorist organisation may have believed if opposition forces knew hostages were in the compound , he would be safe from drone strikes			0

president @entity109 has taken ' full responsibility ' for the attack which killed dr @entity10 and @entity112 aid worker mr @entity18 in january			1

pictured next to his wife are his two daughters , his son - in - law and two granddaughters ' we were so hopeful that those in the @entity3 and @entity21 governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through			1
we do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding @entity10 's death but we do understand that the @entity3 government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances			1
' we look forward to the results of that investigation			0
but those who took @entity10 captive over three years ago bear ultimate responsibility			0
i can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of @entity21			2
' the cowardly actions of those who took @entity10 captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with @entity169 and they will have to face their @entity170 to answer for their actions , ' mrs. @entity164 said			2
' @entity10 spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people 's lives better			0
in @entity21 , where he was working before he was abducted , he loved and respected the @entity21 people and their culture			0

' ' i want to thank congressman @entity192 , senator @entity193 , and senator @entity194 - as well as specific officials from the @entity196 - for their relentless efforts to free my husband			0
' unfortunately , the assistance we received from other elements of the @entity201 was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years			0
we hope that my husband 's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the @entity3 government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families			1
' ' i am disappointed in the government and military in @entity21			2
@entity10 's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country , but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself , instead treating @entity10 's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority			2
i hope the nature of our future relationship with @entity21 is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these			0
