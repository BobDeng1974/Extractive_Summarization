@entity2 had a rare tumour growing in the blood vessels on her neck
the tumour caused a bruise - like rash that spread from her neck to chest
only six other @entity24 children were affected with the same tumour
@entity2 had to undergo 12 months of chemotherapy and was *injected* with steroids for nine months to help shrink the tumour
she was the first person in the country to be given a treatment *specifically* for transplant patients to treat her tumour
