by @entity0 published : 07:33 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 09:09 est , 12 june 2012 a teenager who suffers from a rare condition that made her sick up to 30 times a day is at last on the road to recovery after she had a pacemaker fitted in her stomach			1
@entity9 , 19 , had been in agony for years after she developed gastroparesis , paralysis of the stomach muscles , in 2007			1
the condition caused the desperate teen to vomit up to 30 times a day , and saw her shrink to seven stone			2
recovering : @entity9 with her dog ( left ) is now able to go on holiday and eat proper meals			1
she shrunk to 7st due to a mystery condition that was revealed to be gastroparesis over the next few years puzzled doctors explored everything from appendicitis to irritable bowel syndrome , as well as kidney problems and cancer			1
finally she was diagnosed with gastroparesis			2
@entity9 , from @entity28 , near @entity29 , said : ' i was absolutely stunned when doctors said i would have to have a pacemaker fitted			1
' but now , i 'm so grateful for it			2
' when doctors first suggested a pacemaker to me , i was really shocked - i thought they were just something that old people needed for heart conditions			1
' it 's not a cure , it 's more of a way to manage my symptoms			2
it 's been a living hell trying to find out what was wrong			2
' some days i was so ill i felt like i wanted to die			2
i said " do n't treat me any more , just let me go "			2
' but then i wake up the next day and say ' that was n't me , that was the pain talking '			0
' i finally feel like i 'm on the road to recovery			0
' in 2010 @entity9 had to be fed nightly through a tube ( pictured ) @entity9 , a keen swimmer , first noticed pain in her stomach during a lifesaving class - and mistakenly believed she was suffering from cramp			1
@entity9 said : ' i thought it was cramp at first , but i quickly realised it was worse than that			1
as a swimmer , i 'm used to aches and pains , but this did seem worse			0
' it was as if somebody was standing with 10 knives stabbing me			0
' the pain subsided eventaully , but kept coming back every few days - and when it came back , it got worse			0
' her worried parents @entity67 , 45 , and @entity68 , 48 , took her to @entity69 at @entity70 numerous times but puzzled doctors could not diagnose her			1
they even suggested to @entity9 that it could be all in her head			1
although they discovered she had an unrelated kidney condition , they could n't figure out what was causing the pain , which at times left her unable to stand up			2
@entity9 is now a healthier size ( left ) after a gastric pacemaker allowed her to eat properly for the first time in years			1
pictured at her school leaver 's ball , right but in february , 2010 @entity9 took a turn for the worse while in @entity87			1
she said : ' one day i fell into unconsciousness while i was at the hospital			0
' the crash team were called , intensive care doctors and so were my mum and dad			2
' i was out of it for about three days and i was moved to the high dependency unit			0
my body was just shutting down			0
' i thought i was dead			0
it was only because my mum was on one side holding my hand and my dad was on the other that i realised i was n't			0
i realised i had something to fight for			0
' mother @entity67 , said : ' that was the darkest day of my life			0
they did n't know what was wrong with her.the doctors came to speak to @entity68 and me and we asked ' is she going to be ok ? ' and they said we are doing everything			2
' but @entity9 pulled through , and on may 10 that year surgeons opened up her abdomen , leaving her with a big scar down her front , to see if they could discover what was wrong			1
they still did n't find an answer and when she woke up she was even more poorly			0
for the next year she was sick up to 30 times a day			2
she could n't eat or drink , and had to be fed nightly through a tube			0
her weight dropped to under seven stone and she was dangerously ill. @entity9 was able to do the @entity124 with her proud mother @entity67 this year @entity9 with her dog @entity126 : she said the pain felt like being stabbed that summer , doctors finally discovered what was wrong , after doing tests on @entity132			1
she has gastroparesis , paralysis of the stomach muscles , which means they do n't contract in the normal way to empty food			1
that august , @entity9 was offered a temporary gastric pacemaker			1
she said : ' for the full six days i could eat and drink and i was n't sick			0
the pacemaker has two wires that fed into my stomach and it sets pulses and makes my stomach do what it should do			1
' however , @entity29 and @entity148 said she could n't have the permanent version , called an enterra , until there was funding but they did n't know how long it could take			0
@entity9 said : ' i was at the stage where if i did n't get it i thought i was going to die			1
it was the only option			0
i thought ' i can not do this for the rest of my life			0
' @entity9 's scrapbook on her mysterious condition finally , the health board said the money was there , and , on april 21 , 2011 , she became the youngest of only around 50 people in the @entity168 to have it fitted			1
a spokesperson for @entity29 and @entity148 , said : ' patients referred to the gastric pacemaker service have a complex nature of conditions which may require thishighly specialised surgical intervention			1
' before surgery can be considered patients undergo an extensive assessment			0
the reason for this extensive assessment is the highly specialist nature of the procedure andthe need for the input of a very full multi-disciplinary team			0
' this patient has now had a gastric pacemaker fitted and we are delighted to hear she ismaking good progress			1
' although she is still in pain , which she must sometimes take morphine to handle , @entity9 can finally enjoy her life			2
she has just been on her first holiday to @entity193 , and is finally able to eat and drink normally			0
@entity9 added : ' i could have been diagnosed , and thought , ' that 's my life gone '			1
' but i 've decided that this is what i 've got , i ca n't change it , i might as well make the most of it			0
' i want to say thanks to my family and friends because they 've been an amazing support			0
' her mother said : ' @entity9 's a very positive and caring girl			1
you can see her teenage life has been taken away from her			0

@entity9 , now 19 , was the youngest of only around 50 people in the @entity168 to have a gastric pacemaker fitted last year
