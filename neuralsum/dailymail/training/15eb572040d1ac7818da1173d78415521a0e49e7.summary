this week a boat carrying hundreds of migrants sunk 100 miles south of @entity10			1

video courtesy of @entity75 the body of an @entity77 would - be migrant washed up on the shore of @entity80 in @entity58 it is thought the man was travelling on a boat that sank off the coast of @entity58 headed for @entity36 on sunday a @entity58 official surveys the scene and writes down notes as he stands next to the body of the migrant he said : ' it was three in the afternoon when we finally got into the last cabin in the bow after having got past a wall of bodies			1
' the divers still had ten minutes oxygen left when they got through a wall of bodies to the last cabin in the bow and saw a mother with a baby bump			0
he told @entity75 : ' we could n't leave without doing something for her			0
we took her out forming a human chain with our arms			0
then we lay her on the sea bed			0
with a rope we joined her to the other bodies and with buoyancy aids we took them towards the light			0
' it was n't until we passed the body to our colleagues in the boat that they made the shocking discovery - in her leggings was a newborn baby			2
none of us could believe it			0
we all began to cry - my mask was full of tears			0
' the police marshall said he had never before lost control in the job			0
' but in front of that newborn baby i lost my cool			0
the baby may never have seen light - only the darkness at the bottom of the sea			0
it was a horrible job			0
' earlier today the body of a migrant who tried to flee @entity140 for a new life in @entity142 washed up on a @entity58 beach			1
the gruesome discovery was made on the shore of @entity80 , east of @entity146 days after the trawler he is thought to have been travelling on sank off the @entity58 coast claiming at least 17 lives			1
the sinking , which has so far led to two arrests , comes amid claims hundreds of thousands more would - be illegal immigrants are preparing to set sail for southern @entity36			1
those rescued from the sunken ship were taken by the @entity36 navy to @entity160 harbour in @entity161 the ship , @entity162 was sent to rescue the migrants off the coast of @entity146 where they were stranded 17 bodies have so far been recovered by the @entity36 navy			1
here coffins containing the bodies were carried off the rescue ship the body , which has not yet been identified , is one of 17 so far recovered while 206 people were rescued by patrol boats and merchant ships from the wreck in international waters between @entity58 and @entity36			1
@entity36 media have cited coastguards as saying there were around 400 people on board , which would mean dozens are still unaccounted for			1
survivors include two @entity34 children who lost their parents and siblings			0
@entity36 authorities have now detained two @entity188 suspected of smuggling migrants aboard the boat having arrested them on suspicion of murder			2
@entity36 , with its southernmost island , @entity10 , just 70 km off the coast of @entity140 , is the first port of call for many seeking a new life in @entity142			1
now the country has threatened to send asylum - seekers across @entity142 without more help to stem the tide of arrivals			2
so far this year more than 36,000 migrants have arrived by boat on @entity36 ’s shores , with authorities warning the rate is even faster than the record number of 2011 during the @entity207			2
migrant traffickers often mix with their passengers only to abandon them when accomplices in speedboats arrive to return the smugglers to base			0
@entity36 intelligence says that another 800,000 would - be migrants are on the @entity77 coastline ready to set sail			1
@entity36 ’s interior minister @entity218 said that , without more help with sea patrols , @entity36 would defy @entity222 rules obliging migrants to stay in the country where they land and allow them to travel on to northern @entity142			1
' we 'll just let them go , ' he said			0
' since migrants do not want to stay in @entity36 , they should have the opportunity to exercise their right of political asylum in the rest of @entity142			1
otherwise we transform @entity36 into the prison of political refugees			2
' survivors of the sunken vessel were temporarily taken to a sports hall in @entity160 where they were given makeshift beds the migrants are staying there while police and mediators work on identification and reunification of families officials list the identifications of migrants in a sports hall in @entity160 which has been converted into a makeshift home for survivors he said that @entity142 should intercept migrants in @entity58 , setting up camps and offering humanitarian aid to migrants , before they set sail for @entity142			1
‘ the humanitarian reception must start in @entity140			0
@entity142 must go there , put up tents and take care of migrants there , ’ he added			2
the interior minister of libya @entity264 said that they could not cope with the influx of migrants transiting through from sub @entity140 saying that ‘ @entity142 must pay the price ’			2
@entity58 has descended into lawless chaos since the failure of the @entity207 , powerless to stop the criminal gangs of human traffickers shipping thousands of migrants to @entity142 , often on overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels			1
after the tragic shipwreck that killed more than 300 off the island of @entity10 last autumn , an @entity222 wide sea patrol from @entity278 was planned , but has so far failed to materialise .			1
