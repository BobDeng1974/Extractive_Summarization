diving and feigning injury are the scourge of the modern game			1
we used to blame foreigners but now everybody is at it and it needs to be stopped			1
how ? by making sure we punish the offenders			0
last weekend @entity10 and @entity11 got away with ridiculous play - acting			1
@entity11 dived over thin air and @entity10 farcically held his face after he was pushed in the chest			1
@entity17 players used to have a reputation for being strong and honest but that stereotype has disappeared			1
since 2006 , the three worst culprits in the @entity21 are @entity17			0
@entity24 ( 7 ) , @entity22 ( 5 ) and @entity23 ( 4 ) were all booked multiple times for diving			1
he could easily have gone down to try to get @entity43 sent off			0
everything is appealed for — throw - ins , corners , tackles			2
players are hard - wired to challenge the referee ’s decision to try to gain as much of an advantage as possible			1
diving and faking injury is an extension of that			1
it ’s ultra-competitive but it ’s not very sporting			1
one of the most important elements of any sport is being able to trust your opponent			0
you can go hammer and tongs for 90 minutes and then shake hands at the end knowing it was an honest battle			0
that ’s where you earn the respect of your opponents			2
@entity11 goes down all - too easily after feigning contact with @entity72 's @entity71 @entity11 falls to the floor in and won a free - kick for @entity35 despite no contact between the players when i played you never wanted to show you had been hurt — you ’d only limp when your opponent was n’t watching ! in the second half of my career that changed			1
i certainly would n’t be on a list of @entity21 do - gooders but i relished scraps with @entity84 and @entity85 because they were hard but fair			1
one of the reasons the infamous incident with @entity88 at @entity89 came about was because i did n’t trust him — he was constantly falling over trying to win a free - kick			2
the sad truth is that conning a referee is now part of a player ’s decision - making process			1
they think : ‘ do i pass , take this player on or knock it forward and try to win a free - kick			2
’ @entity39 looks bemused after @entity101 's @entity43 makes contact with his forehead gamesmanship like that scrapes at the fabric of sportsmanship and it ’s one of the issues that makes players ’ and fans ’ blood boil			1
player dishonesty also leads to a risk of further incidents			0
dives provoke players , which increases the likelihood of retaliation			2
football is full of injustices but if referees are n’t careful , aggression spills over			0
it would be refreshing if managers castigated their own players but the best punishment is a ban			1
fines do n’t work , particularly on clubs for failing to control players			2
it ’s far better to hit offenders where it hurts : with a suspension			2
@entity137 rears up and mocks @entity88 after the @entity138 missed a penalty at @entity89 @entity137 enjoys a hard but fair tussle with @entity84 in the 1998 @entity142 final if a player dives then he should be banned			2
for a serial offender , double the number of games			0
the same goes for feigning injury			1
if these punishments already existed then the problem might already be eradicated			0
this is an embarrassing issue and governing bodies need to look closely at it			0
do we really want parents telling kids to take a dive or fake an injury in their @entity159 games ? the standards set in the @entity21 send out the biggest message of all			0
it ’s time they got this one right			0
@entity166 @entity168 v @entity167 is a defining match for both of them			0
for the @entity168 it ’s a massive test			0
are the big boys too much for them or is it gloves off and time to fight ? can @entity167 be champions again ? there will probably be a lot of mixed feelings about that in their camp			0
the @entity182 result was big but if they do n’t beat @entity168 , their title challenge could be over .			0
