by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 03:22 est , 13 december 2012 @entity1 's today became the first city in the @entity3 to ban students from smoking marijuana at school			1
the city 's mayor @entity7 introduced the law after school chiefs complained about pupils turning up to classes high after rolling up outside the grounds			1
marijuana is widely available in @entity16 as , although it is technically illegal , police ca n't prosecute people for possession of small amounts			1
the @entity3 ' relaxed drug policy means some youngsters are turning up to classes stoned , prompting a ban of its use near schools ( file picture ) but it has also had the unwanted side effect that @entity3 children are frequently exposed to the drug in public areas			1
@entity33 spokeswoman @entity32 says schools have always forbidden pot , but found it difficult to enforce the policy when students smoked on or near campus and challenged administrators to do anything about it			0
' it 's not really what you have in mind as an educator , that children would be turning up for class stoned , or drunk either for that matter , ' she said			2
' but it has been a problem for some schools			2
' tolerance : @entity1 is known for its ' coffee shops ' , where marijuana can be purchased and smoked ( file picture ) after a change in national law , the city will now be able to declare as of january 1 ' no toking zones ' - areas like schools and playgrounds where weed - smoking is forbidden by law			2
the move is closely paired with a decision by the new government to ditch plans for a national ' weed pass ' that would have blocked tourists from buying marijuana			0
that was a measure years in the making , and greatly desired by southern cities such as @entity75 that have been flooded with dealers from @entity77 and @entity78 who drive across the border to buy weed in bulk			0
marijuana has been tolerated in @entity16 for decades , attracting many tourists who travel there to enjoy the drug but the weed pass was opposed by @entity1 , where drug tourists are not generally seen as causing many problems			1
last month , @entity90 der @entity7 proclaimed that coffee shops would stay open for tourists after all			0
in a letter wednesday , he noted that one in three tourists who come to @entity1 try marijuana while they 're here , more than previously estimated			0
after several decades of the tolerance policy , @entity3 marijuana usage rates are in the middle of international norms , higher than those in neighboring @entity78 , but lower than those in @entity103 , @entity104 or the @entity105 .			0
