by @entity0 published : 04:56 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 12:38 est , 3 may 2013 a rare @entity3 bomber from the @entity4 is set to be raised from the @entity5 where it has lain for seven decades , it was announced today			1
the retrieval of the last surviving @entity9 from the @entity10 off the coast of @entity12 will be the biggest recovery of its kind in @entity16 waters			0
the aircraft was first spotted by divers in 2008 , lying 50ft below the surface on a chalk bed , surrounded by debris			0
work began today to raise what is the only surviving @entity4 @entity29 bomber from its watery grave in the @entity5 under the sea : a @entity9 bomber which lies off the coast of @entity12 is set to be recovered sonar scans carried out by the @entity36 , @entity37 and the @entity38 confirmed that the plane is the @entity41 number 1160 , which was shot down during the @entity42			1
two of its four - man crew were killed as it crashed into the sea , but the other two were captured and taken into custody as prisoners of war			0
the plane , which is said to be in ' remarkable condition ' , was one of the @entity55 's ' flying pencil ' bombers , named for their narrow fuselage			2
it is covered in coral , barnacles and other marine life , but is otherwise largely intact			0
the main undercarriage tyres remain inflated and the propellers clearly show the damage inflicted during the bomber 's final crash landing			2
lifting the plane from the sea will take around three weeks using pioneering technology , and will be dependent on tides and weather conditions			2
mission : recovery workers prepare the mechanism which will help to retrieve the @entity3 plane from the channel unprecedented : this will be the biggest operation of its kind ever to take place in @entity16 waters the @entity9 was known as the ' flying pencil ' , because of its unusually narrow fuselage			1
it was one of the main bombers used by the @entity55 during the @entity4 , including at the @entity42 in 1940			1
the plane was developed to be a commercial aircraft , but was turned down by @entity88 and redesigned into a bomber			1
although the @entity9 was no longer made after 1940 , it was used by @entity29 forces throughout the war			0
more than 400 of them were flown in the @entity42 , with 171 shot down by the @entity94 or otherwise lost			1
the planes were 52ft long with a wingspan of 59ft , and could carry 2,000lb of explosives while manned by a crew of four			0
none of the aircraft were believed to have survived for long after the end of the conflict , until the discovery of the plane off the coast of @entity12			2
a frame will be built around the aircraft underwater , and will then be slowly winched up and placed on a floating platform			0
the operation has been made possible by a grant of more than £ 345,000 from the @entity111			2
@entity112 , director general of the @entity36 , said : ' the discovery and recovery of the @entity24 is of national and international importance			1
' the aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the @entity118			0
' it will provide an evocative and moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of the @entity42 and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men of both air forces and from many nations			1
' when the @entity128 has been recovered , it will be prepared for display at the @entity36 in @entity130 , @entity131			1
the preservation work will take place at the museum 's conservation centre in @entity136 , @entity137 , where the plane will be placed in two hydration tunnels and soaked in citric acid			2
channel : the plane was sunk in @entity10 , off the coast of @entity12 near deal in action : a @entity128 bomber similar to the one which crashed into the sea during the @entity42 culture minister @entity149 said : ' today marks the beginning of an exciting project to raise the last surviving @entity9 bomber from the @entity5			1
' i 'm delighted the @entity36 and the @entity111 have joined forces to make this project possible and i know that it will be a tremendous addition to the museum 's collection where it will serve to educate and entertain all who visit			1
' the @entity9 will join a range of more than 1,200 objects and places which have been safeguarded by the @entity111 at a cost of more than £ 300million			0
these include @entity166 , the last surviving @entity168 ship , a rare collection of work by codebreaker @entity172 and @entity173 , the last surviving submarine of the @entity4			0
the @entity128 is not the only @entity4 plane to be the subject of a recovery mission - a @entity16 enthusiast is currently searching for a haul of @entity180 lost in the @entity182 jungle			0
@entity183 has hired a team of workers to find the 36 fighters which he says were delivered to the country at the very end of the war .			0

@entity3 bomber has lain in @entity5 since the @entity42
£ *350,000* project to retrieve the plane and display it at the @entity36
