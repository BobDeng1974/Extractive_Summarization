there were angry scenes in court as @entity15 , 32 , escaped a jail term for launching an attack on tiny @entity2 that ' could have killed him '			1
now , @entity2 ’s mum @entity18 , 22 , has told how @entity2 robbed her of a year of her baby ’s life as he was taken into care as police investigated who was responsible for @entity2 ’s injuries because @entity2 would not admit what he had done			1
a court has heard @entity2 ' momentarily lost control ' and gripped , shook and threw down @entity2 , who will be three next month , on january 16 , 2010			1
@entity2 has now admitted assault causing grievous bodily harm			1
judge @entity31 , sitting at @entity30 , imposed a 12 - month sentence suspended for two years , saying the only thing that kept @entity2 out of jail was his low intelligence			1
@entity36 , @entity18 ’s uncle , shouted : ' it ’s a disgrace			1
you ’ve let him walk the streets of @entity40			0
he has got away with hurting @entity2			1
' after the case , @entity18 said : ' he almost killed his own son and should have been locked up			1
' i feel disappointed and let down by the system that it has taken since 2010 for this to come to court			0
but even now @entity5 has n’t said how the injuries were caused			0
' @entity49 , prosecuting , told the court @entity2 , who had a daughter by a previous relationship , did not work and was described as ' lazy ' at home , doing little to look after @entity2			1
@entity18 was taking a hairdressing course at @entity56 and on january 16 left @entity57 to look after @entity2 on his own			1
brutal : @entity15 with @entity2 just after he was born but weeks later the father turned and fractured his skull miss @entity49 told how at lunchtime @entity2 phoned 999 and paramedics arrived			1
@entity2 said @entity2 was ' floppy ' and ' breathing funny ' but insisted nothing had happened			1
at first medics suspected meningitis but investigations subsequently found that @entity2 had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain			1
a doctor later said @entity2 had been subjected to ' significant forces '			1
it was likely the baby had been ' held , shaken and thrown down			1
' upset : @entity18 is furious her former partner @entity15 has not received a custodial sentence after pleading guilty to assault on her son @entity2 denied hurting his son but admitted to being ' a bit heavy - handed or rough ' but no - one had shown him how to handle a baby			1
a ‘ findings of fact ’ hearing in june 2010 decided that @entity2 had caused the injuries			2
@entity82 , for @entity2 , presented a psychological report which described @entity2 as ' less intellectually able than 99 percent of his peers			2
' miss @entity82 said : ' the defendant ’s limited capabilities meant he was not able to deal with @entity2 when he had one of his more difficult periods			2
' @entity2 suffered with colic and i am sure those with children understand how difficult colic is			2
' the defendant should really never have been left alone with the child			2
' the defendant had a momentary loss of temper and caused the injuries			0
' sentencing , judge @entity100 said : ' a child is precious and needs to be protected and handled gently and carefully			2
' they do not always do what we want			0
they often make noises and messes that we do n’t want them to			0
' you did something very bad to him when he was only a few weeks old			0
' you hurt him , you shook him and threw him down and broke his skull			2
' it ’s an injury that could hurt him for a very long time			0
it could have killed him			0
' @entity2 was also given a two - year supervision order and told he could never work with children			1
@entity18 told after the case how she left @entity2 with @entity2 while she returned to college for one day a week			1
she was called out of an exam to news that @entity2 had been rushed to hospital			2
she said : ' i have never felt so scared in all my life			0
i thought he was going to die			0
' happy and healthy : @entity2 has fully recovered from his injuries @entity2 insisted he knew nothing of @entity2 ’s injuries but a specialist decided it was ' non-accidental ' , meaning @entity18 was only allowed supervised access to her son			1
' i was confused , angry and just wanted to hold my poorly baby , ' she said			0
' we were asked how the injuries happened and were given the opportunity to admit to anything			0
i was devastated that anyone could have hurt my baby			0
' had @entity5 confessed at the very beginning my baby would have been returned to me			0
' shocking : members of the child 's family erupted in anger when they heard the verdict at @entity30 but @entity2 was placed with foster parents and @entity18 had a daily 30 - mile round trip to see him			1
she said : ' leaving my baby was the hardest thing and our bond was destroyed			0
' it was obvious he saw his foster mum and dad as his real parents and i was devastated			0
i missed so many of his milestones and i can never get that back			0
' i was 10 years younger than @entity5 and never suspected he had learning difficulties , yes i knew he had problems with reading and writing but never in a million years would i have suspected he had such a low iq			0
' he was a popular lad , he liked to go out and have a laugh			0
there was no way i ’d have left @entity2 in his care if i had suspected such a thing			2
he ’d never been violent towards me			0
' now i hate him and i am appalled that he is allowed to go unpunished for what he did to his own child			0
' it is hoped @entity2 , who has started nursery , will suffer no lasting effects .			2

@entity15 admitted assaulting his child @entity2 but got a suspended sentence because of his ' low intelligence '
he had ' gripped , shaken , and thrown ' the baby , fracturing his skull
@entity2 's mum @entity18 was separated from her boy for a year as police investigated because @entity2 would *n't* confess he did it
