by @entity0 @entity2 ’s diameter is said to be 7,918 miles , but how does that compare to planets outside our solar system ? until now , astronomers have relied on estimations to determine the magnitude of alien worlds - but a new method has enabled them to make the most accurate size calculation for an exoplanet to date			1
the planet in question is @entity16 , and scientists claim it has a diameter of 11,700 miles ( 18,800 kilometres ) - plus or minus 150 miles ( 240 kilometres )			2
researchers in @entity20 say kepler - 93b is 1.481 times the size of @entity2 ( illustration shown )			1
the accurate measurement was made with two @entity26 telescopes			1
these measurements confirm the planet is what 's known as a super-earth to make the key measurement about this exoplanet 's radius , the @entity31 and @entity32 telescopes each watched @entity31 - 93b cross , or transit , the face of its star , eclipsing a tiny portion of starlight			1
@entity31 's unflinching gaze also simultaneously tracked the dimming of the star caused by seismic waves moving within its interior			0
these readings encode precise information about the star 's interior			0
the team leveraged them to narrowly gauge the star 's radius , which is crucial for measuring the planetary radius			0
@entity32 , meanwhile , confirmed that the exoplanet 's transit looked the same in infrared light as in @entity31 's visible - light observations			1
taken together , the data boast an error bar of just one per cent of the radius of @entity31 - 93b			0
the measurements mean that the planet , estimated at about 11,700 miles ( 18,800 kilometers ) in diameter , could be bigger or smaller by about 150 miles ( 240 kilometers )			0
this is almost one - and - a - half times the size of our planet , making @entity31 - 93b officially a super-earth			1
scientists made the measurements using @entity26 ’s @entity31 and @entity74			1
the size of the exoplanet is now known to an uncertainty of just 74 miles ( 119 kilometres ) on either side of the planetary body			0
although super-earths are common in the galaxy , none exist in our solar system			0
exoplanets like @entity16 are therefore an ideal target to study this major class of planet			0
with good limits on the sizes and masses of super-earths , scientists can finally start to theorise about what makes up these worlds			0
previous measurements , by the @entity96 in @entity97 , had put @entity100 's mass at about 3.8 times that of @entity2			2
the density of @entity16 , derived from its mass and newly - obtained radius , indicates the planet is in fact very likely made of iron and rock , like @entity2			2
' with @entity31 and @entity32 , we 've captured the most precise measurement to date of an alien planet 's size , which is critical for understanding these far - off worlds , ' said dr @entity113 , a @entity26 @entity114 at the @entity115 in @entity116 and lead author of a paper on the findings published in the @entity120			1
' the measurement is so precise that it 's literally like being able to measure the height of a six - foot tall person to within three quarters of an inch - if that person were standing on @entity127 , ' said @entity113			0
to make the key measurement about this exoplanet 's radius , the @entity31 and @entity32 ( illustration shown ) telescopes each watched @entity31 - 93b cross , or transit , the face of its star , eclipsing a tiny portion of starlight			1
taken together , this data has an error bar of just one per cent of the radius of @entity31 - 93b kepler - 93b orbits a star located around 300 light - years away , with approximately 90 per cent of the sun 's mass and radius			1
the exoplanet 's orbital distance - only about one - sixth that of @entity147 's from the sun - implies a scorching surface temperature around @entity152 ( 1,400 ° f )			0
despite its newfound similarities in composition to @entity2 , kepler - 93b is far too hot for life			2
' @entity113 and her team have made a major scientific advance while demonstrating the power of @entity32 's new approach to exoplanet observations , ' said dr @entity162 , project scientist for the @entity163 at @entity26 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 .			2

researchers in @entity20 say @entity16 is 1.481 times the size of @entity2
the accurate measurement was made with two @entity26 telescopes
using @entity31 and @entity32 the astronomers have an error of just 1 *%*
these measurements confirm the planet is what 's known as a super-earth
@entity16 is 300 light years but to hot to support life as we know it
