these magnificent snow - capped mountains , found deep within a country very few @entity3 tourists dare to visit , are virtually untouched			1
every year a handful of adventurous skiers are brave enough to make the long trek to @entity7 , in @entity8 , even though it ’s one of the most dangerous countries in the world			1
those who make the trip are being inspired by locals , who are some of the poorest people on the planet , and joining in a grassroots effort to grow the sport in @entity8 and develop the region into a destination for tourists			1
but @entity7 , which lies on the @entity39 that cuts through @entity40 , is a picturesque setting in the winter thanks to the snow - covered @entity43 mountains , one of the least explored ranges in the world			2
for years , locals have been using primitive skis fashioned from planks of wood and homemade poles to go up and down the mountains , which are home to peaceful minority groups			0
they ’re now being joined by more westerners who are looking for adventure , including a select few who are trying to improve their lives			0
a professional snowboarder from @entity63 leaps over a donkey and locals during a film shoot a grassroots effort is underway to transform @entity7 into a destination for ski tourists organisations and companies are introducing modern equipment and training , and providing jobs to locals			1
the @entity75 launched the programme in 2008 , with @entity78 brand @entity77 providing equipment and training for locals , and the @entity78 ski resort of @entity82 raising funds and inviting two @entity85 skiers to the @entity86 for training			1
in 2011 , @entity87 , a @entity88 tour operator , became the first company to take ski tourists to @entity8			1
since then it has been bringing 10 to 20 foreign skiers to the mountain range every year , taking great care with respect to safety and security , said co-founder @entity98			2
with no ski lift or rope tow , skiers must hike up the mountain before skiing back down but @entity7 , which lies on the @entity39 that cuts through @entity40 , is a picturesque setting in the winter each holidaymaker pays £ 1,700 for a 10 - day trip , which includes accommodation , food , local transport and instruction from an internationally qualified ski guide			1
they are usually joined by local guides as well			0
mr @entity113 said : ‘ the ski conditions are good			0
@entity8 does have a high risk of avalanches , so on many days we have to stick to low elevations			2
‘ in @entity7 , in winter it is cold , it snows			2
however there are many more clear days when in @entity123			0
in the summer it has warm days and cool nights			0
’ it is the definition of raw skiing , as there are no ski lifts , meaning skiers must hike up the mountain			2
a ski tourist has a laugh after taking a tumble while on holiday in @entity8 the @entity43 mountains in @entity8 are one of the least explored ranges in the world unlike other areas in @entity8 , @entity7 is not under threat from insurgent groups and is quite safe for tourists , said mr @entity113			1
he said : ‘ @entity7 is one of the few places in @entity8 where it is possible to do such type of outdoor activities			1
@entity8 is a melting pot of different religious and ethnic groups			2
‘ whilst this is one of the reasons for its troubled history it is also why certain areas of the country can be perfectly safe , or at least no riskier than other @entity40 developing countries , to visit whilst others would be extremely dangerous			0
’ the tour groups avoid dangerous areas , including unstable regions in the @entity163 heartland , and they keep a low profile and are cautious when they travel into @entity165 , the capital , about 100 miles south - east of @entity7			1
a professional snowboarder soars through the air during a visit to @entity7 in @entity8 in 2011 , @entity87 became the first company to take ski tourists to @entity8 the @entity88 tour operator takes 10 to 20 ski tourists to @entity8 every year mr @entity113 said : ‘ if we walk in the city we will always have a car nearby , we will continually check safety reports and we will stay in discreet guest houses , not in the big hotels that are well - known targets			1
‘ however , the cities are well covered by security personnel and are generally very calm			0
if we thought that there was a major risk in any particular city then we would avoid it			0
’ he added : ‘ driving between cities is also something we take a long look at with regards to security			0
we check reports from a service that provides security updates to @entity193 workers and also ask drivers we know who regularly take passengers on the roads we take			0
we also get calls and texts from a security service should there be problems on the road			0
’ ‘ the security on the road is actually currently not too bad but it has been bad in the past and it makes sense not to take any undue risk if flights are available			0
@entity7 is home to @entity8 's only ski race , which pits locals against ski tourists competitors in the @entity217 race up the hill before skiing back down ‘ many of our guests have some safety concerns			1
it is @entity8 after all			0
however by the end of their trip their perception of @entity8 has changed a lot			0
’ of all the things that help to change visitors ’ perceptions of @entity8 , the locals of @entity7 play a massive role			1
tourists have plenty of opportunities to interact with them as locals work as ski guides , drivers and tour organisers , and some sell drinks and snacks			2
another opportunity is the annual @entity217 , an incredible event where local and foreign skiers compete in a race up and down the slopes			2
the event , @entity8 ’s only ski race , is operated by the @entity249 , which also arranges training and equipment for local skiers			1
@entity98 said the local skiers usually beat the tourists in the @entity217 mr @entity113 said locals , who strap planks of wood to their feet , usually beat the foreigners as they ski up the mountain and then ski back down			1
last winter three professional snowboarders visited @entity7 to record @entity8 ’s first ever snowboard film , calling it @entity261			1
during the summer , @entity7 is a popular stop for @entity85 tourists , who visit the lakes at @entity265			2
the region is also a draw for those who compete in or watch buzkashi , the country ’s national sport			0
it is a fierce competition where athletes on horseback carry the corpse of a decapitated goat , instead of a ball , and attempt to throw it into a scoring circle .			0
