by @entity0 when , early one morning , my partner and i told our 11 - year - old son we were going to get married after 15 years together , he excitedly rushed to school and broke the good news to his teachers			1
months later , after proudly acting as ring bearer at the register office and delivering the best man speech at our wedding party , @entity9 declared it had been the best weekend of his life			1
so eight years on , in 2007 , when my husband @entity19 walked out , the personal sense of loss and anguish that i felt was accompanied by a profound sense that we had let down our son			1
i was convinced he would now see love as an illusion , a sham , and that his view of marriage would be skewed for ever			1
@entity9 ( right ) said that his mother @entity29 ' s wedding to his father @entity19 was the ' best weekend of his life ' my husband believed that if our relationship was to end , it should be when our son was going off to university			1
he said this would be ‘ best ’ for @entity9 , in so far as he was grown up enough to lead an independent life			1
i thought it might be the worst of all times , given that it would coincide with him starting to form tentative romantic and sexual relationships			0
if his own parents — who for a large part of his life , had seemed so loving and happy — could drift apart , what kind of confusing message would that convey to him about the possibility of having a successful marriage as he embarked on an important stage in his life ? new research from @entity54 — which suggests that half of today ’s 20 - year - olds will never marry — reminded me of all this			1
it may have come as a shock to the researchers , but it is no surprise to me			0
given that 42 per cent of marriages will end in divorce , my generation — and the generation of 40 - somethings behind me — have n’t exactly been good role models			1
growing up in the 50s and 60s , i ca n’t recall a single divorced couple among my parents ’ friends			1
my own mother and father , who were always companionable and affectionate , were married for 60 years before my dad died			1
bad example ? @entity29 , who has been divorced twice , with her son @entity9 , 26 my assumption then , based on example and expectations within society , was that love led to marriage and that marriage was for eternity			1
my own brutal awakening was a disastrous first marriage that began when i was 19 and ended six years later when i realised we were incompatible in every way			1
although i was shaken by this break - up , i was still able to look at my parents ’ wonderful example of long - lasting love and believe in its possibility			0
sadly , my son and his generation have far fewer such examples to hang on to			2
now 26 , @entity9 is still single and house - sharing with friends			1
and , as for most of his generation , marriage is currently the last thing on his mind			2
he does n’t describe himself or his friends as commitment - phobic , as such , but he does regard himself as one of the ‘ wary generation ’			0
happier times : @entity29 with her ex-husband @entity19 so many of his pals ’ parents are divorced too that he knows , however loving a relationship , it may not last			2
on the one hand , it saddens me that his eyes are as wide open to the possibility of failure as they are to success			0
on the other , i think it ’s no bad thing if romantic aspirations are tempered by pragmatism rather than fuelled by fairytales with a ‘ happy ever after ’			0
last week ’s report points to a general decline in marriage and a dramatic fall in the wedded state among those in their 20s			2
in 1970 , the peak year for marriage , 564,818 men and women aged 25 tied the knot			1
in 2010 , just 56,598 did — a 90 per cent drop			2
it ’s astonishing that there ’s been such a shift in so short a time			0
but today ’s 20 - somethings are just reacting to what they ’ve seen from us parents			0
a few years ago , i was editor of a glossy wedding magazine , and we decided to take a stand at a wedding fair			2
unlike the other enterprises , selling favours , frocks , flowers and cakes , we had nothing much to offer beyond magazine subscriptions			0
so we opted to offer emotional support from our agony aunt			0
dozens of girls queued for our stand and most ended up in tears as they talked , fortified with a glass of wine			0
the number one stress factor , it turned out , was warring divorced parents and arguments about whether new partners should be invited or banned , who would be allowed to sit at the top table and in a couple of cases whether stepdad or real dad — or mum — should take the bride down the aisle			1
many brides - to - be said it was causing problems with the families and rows with their boyfriends , too , and they were thinking of calling the whole thing off			0
9.7 per cent of the adult @entity185 population are divorced - that 's higher than in @entity188 , @entity189 or @entity190 no wonder they were reluctant to marry			1
of course , parental divorce is not entirely to blame			2
the acceptability of sex before marriage has made the teens and 20s a time for freedom , experimentation and fun rather than settling down for life			2
and girls ’ desire for babies is often put on hold until careers have taken off			0
perhaps the biggest stumbling block for 20 - somethings is economic			0
some 3.3 million youngsters aged between 20 and 34 — nearly a quarter — still live with their parents			0
they ca n’t afford to get married , even if they want to			2
for those who do manage to set up home with a boyfriend or girlfriend , living together is no longer simply a prelude to marriage , it ’s an alternative to it			2
student debt and high house prices mean saving for a deposit , rather than a wedding , is the priority			0
when the daughter of a friend rang her mum to say she had exciting news about her and her boyfriend — with whom she had been renting a flat for two years — my friend assumed she was about to announce her engagement			2
‘ i ’m so so happy , ’ her daughter gushed down the phone			0
‘ @entity236 has asked me to buy a flat with him			0
he ’s inherited a bit of money and i ’ve saved a few thousand			0
is n’t it wonderful ? ’ @entity9 has told @entity29 that his family still means a lot to him marriage was n’t even mentioned			1
that seems to tie in with my son ’s thinking			2
@entity9 says marriage is not high on his list of what he believes constitutes commitment			1
he explained : ‘ commitment is living together			0
it ’s buying a home together			0
or having a child together			0
for me a wedding seems more like a big public performance than anything else			0
’ i ca n’t reverse the fact i ’ve had two divorces			0
nor can i undo the effect of those marriage failures on my son			1
so i ’ve tried to mitigate the impact by remaining on civil terms with his dad and not burdening @entity9 with our hurts and resentments			1
last @entity269 , for example , @entity9 was torn between coming to me for a @entity269 feast with my sister , her family and close friends , or joining his dad , who was going to be on his own			1
so i invited his dad to join us , which he did			0
@entity9 tells me family still means a lot to him			1
he gets on well with @entity278 , my partner of the last few years , and @entity278 ’s two daughters			2
i make a point of fixing extended family gatherings , and at every opportunity mixing up the generations			0
@entity9 always seems happy to join in			1
i ’ve told @entity9 that @entity278 has asked me to marry him but i have turned him down , because , although i intend to stay with @entity278 for the rest of my life , i do not want to make that very public commitment for a third time			1
@entity9 simply smiled and nodded knowingly , but i think he may be relieved that , having witnessed his parents ’ wedding , he does n’t have to witness another ceremony			1
i may not have been a good role model for marriage , but hope i ’ve tried to show love and forgiveness			0
whether or not @entity9 ultimately marries is a decision for him and any future partner			1
i ’d be lying if i said i would n’t shed a tear of happiness to see him walking down the aisle			1
but , sadly , i have to admit that i ’d be a hypocrite if i were ever to suggest it .			0

@entity0 's son @entity9 was *delighted* when she married his father , yet eight years later they were divorced
she had *previously* had a disastrous six year marriage
now she worries her example is putting @entity9 off walking down the aisle
42 per cent of marriages now end in divorce
