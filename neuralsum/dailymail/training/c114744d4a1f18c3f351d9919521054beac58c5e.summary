@entity4 is yet to make an impression at @entity1 after signing on a free from @entity14 but , ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity18 , @entity0 believes it will give the hitman the chance to regain his fitness			1
' it will give us an opportunity to work with him			2
it 'll give us an opportunity that we had with the likes of @entity30 , ' he said			2
' from our point of view it is a good thing			0
hopefully from @entity35 's point of view , ultimately , it 's a good thing			1

' @entity4 has been snubbed from @entity3 's next two games in november the 29 - year - old is yet to start this term after playing in the summer 's @entity42 meant he was behind on his fitness			1
@entity0 said : ' he 's not been ready , he 's not been fit enough			2
i have said all along if you miss pre-season life is very difficult			0
it 's difficult to get fit when other players are doing sessions as you are making sure they are doing the right levels			2
' @entity35 did n't do a pre-season , he had the @entity42 which meant he was having his rest when everyone else was working			0
the @entity1 forward has been a mainstay in the @entity3 set - up before his move to the @entity12 ' other players who missed pre-season were able to top up but he would have spent previous international breaks preparing for games rather than getting ready			1
' he needs to get to the right level physically			0
he has to get the most out of every training session he can			0
' @entity62 is still sidelined with an @entity64 problem while @entity65 is out for the weekend after groin surgery but did return to training on thursday			0
