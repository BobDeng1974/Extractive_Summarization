traffic jams are set to cost the average family more than £ 2,000 a year in lost time by 2030 , a damning report reveals today			1
the cost will rise to more than £ 4,000 a year for families in @entity6 – the @entity8 ’s most congested city			2
over the next 16 years congestion will wipe more than £ 300billion off the @entity8 economy , the @entity11 / @entity10 report concludes			1
by 2030 , the cost of sitting in traffic jams will be higher per person in the @entity8 than in @entity17 , @entity18 or the @entity19 , the @entity11 / @entity10 report concludes traffic congestion : population growth and a booming economy are the main factors driving the rise in traffic population growth – predicted to rise from 64million to 72million in 2030 and offset a fall in average car ownership levels - and a booming national economy are the main factors driving the rise in costly gridlock which will provide ‘ a terrible shock ’ for households			1
the annual cost of jams to the nation will soar by 63 per cent from £ 13billion last year to more than £ 21billion by 2030 – a figure that exceeds entire @entity8 transport budget for 2014 , it says			1
over that same period , the predicted cost per household will increase by 44 percent – from £ 1,426 in 2013 to £ 2,057 – or three times the average @entity8 monthly rent in 2014 , says the report			1
it will see the time spent by the average @entity8 motorist stuck each year in gridlock annually rise from 124 hours last year to 136 hours in 2030 - equivalent to 18 working days a year			2
in @entity6 , which suffers the worst congestion and delays , drivers spent more than 250 hours idling in traffic in 2013			1
this is double the @entity8 average but is set to increase to 299 hours in 2030 - equivalent to 40 working days a year			1
the @entity8 ’s 63 per cent increase will be the highest among the main world economies studies and compares to a 50 per cent rise in the @entity19 and 31 per cent in both @entity18 and @entity17			0
more time is wasted in jams in @entity6 than any major city included in the report 's findings growth in the number of miles travelled by car is forecast to be highest in the @entity8 , and in @entity6 @entity6 will be left in the slow lane , with the sharpest fall in average speeds when in traffic congestion 2013 - 2030 cumulative @entity8 cost of congestion : £ 307billion ( 18 per cent of @entity8 gdp in 2013 ) £ 191billion – direct costs £ 115billion – indirect costs 2013 - 2030 annual @entity8 cost of congestion increase : 63 per cent £ 13.1billion in 2013 £ 21.4billion in 2030 ( more than the entire @entity8 transport budget in 2014 ) 2013 - 2030 per @entity8 household cost of congestion increase : 44 per cent £ 1,426 in 2013 £ 2,057 in 2030 ( three times the average @entity8 monthly rent in 2014 ) source : @entity82 and @entity83 ( @entity10 ) the study from traffic experts @entity11 – who supply data used in car sat - nav systems - and the @entity82 and @entity83 based its @entity8 findings on the @entity8 ’s 18 largest urban areas			1

it says that although households will have fewer cars on average , population growth means there will be more cars on the road in absolute terms ‘ as the @entity8 economy continues to strengthen			2
’ the @entity11 report concludes : ‘ between 2013 and 2030 , the total cumulative cost of congestion to the @entity8 economy is estimated to be a staggering £ 307billion			1
’ of that £ 307billion - equivalent to nearly a fifth ( 18 per cent ) of the nation ’s productive wealth last year - some £ 191billion is in the form of ‘ direct costs ‘ such as the value of fuel and the time wasted by not being productive at work			0
a further £ 115billion is in the form of ‘ indirect costs ’ which relate to higher transport and freight costs and business fees from company vehicles idling in traffic , which are passed on to consumers as additional costs to household bills			0
the report notes that in the @entity8 last year , almost 70 per cent of the workforce commuted to work by car during peak times , with the average @entity8 driver spending 124 hours stuck in gridlock annually			0
‘ this is set to rise to 136 hours in 2030 , equivalent to 18 working days a year			0
this has both a direct and indirect economic impact on car commuting households , ' the report says			0
and adds : ‘ in @entity6 , the @entity8 ’s most congested city , drivers spent more than 250 hours idling in traffic in 2013 , which is double the @entity8 average			1
this is set to increase to 299 hours in 2030 , equivalent to 40 working days a year			2
' the cost of jams : rising congestion in @entity6 is expected to cost families in the capital £ 4,000 each in 2030 2013 - 2030 cumulative @entity6 cost of congestion : £ 130billion £ 68billion – direct costs £ 62billion – indirect costs 2013 - 2030 annual @entity6 cost of congestion increase : 71 per cent £ 5.4billion in 2013 £ 9.3billion in 2030 2013 - 2030 per @entity6 household cost of congestion increase : 44 per cent £ 2,765 in 2013 £ 4,002 in 2030 source : @entity173 and @entity83 ( @entity10 ) it says that although fewer than a third of @entity182 commute to work by car , the cost of living and the value of time for the capital ’s 1.4million car commuters is at such a premium that it will cost ‘ each car commuting household more than £ 4,000 a year by 2030			1
’ the cost of congestion to the capital ’s economy will rise by 71 per cent – from £ 5.4billion in 2013 to £ 9.3billion in 2030			1
the cost per @entity6 household will rise over the same period by 44 per cent – from £ 2,765 in 2013 to £ 4,002 in 2030			2
as a result , the cumulative cost of congestion in @entity6 over the next 16 years will top £ 130billion , of which £ 68billion will be direct costs and £ 62billion indirect costs			1
the @entity11 / @entity10 report concludes that population growth and the ‘ expected strengthening of the @entity8 economy ’ will lead to ‘ a significant increase in the demand for road travel across the country over the next 16 years			1
’ it notes : ‘ population growth is the largest driver of road travel demand in the @entity8			0
@entity8 population is predicted to grow by 12 per cent , from 64million in 2013 to 72million in 2030			2
' @entity6 alone will experience a 20 per cent population increase from 8.4million to 10.1million over the period			0
this will place a significant strain on the capital ’s road network ’			0
@entity218 is predicted to rise by a quarter ( 24 per cent ) by 2030 : ‘ as incomes increase , households are expected to choose car travel over other forms of transport , driving up congestion levels as a result			0
' car ownership levels , which last year stood at stood at 448 vehicles per 1,000 people are ‘ expected to decrease slightly ’ because of shifting attitudes and investment in rail			0
but the report stresses : ‘ the absolute number of vehicles on the @entity8 ’s roads is still expected to be higher by 2030 as a result of continued population growth ’			0
the @entity239 ’s prediction of stable fuel prices suggests @entity8 fuel prices will increase by only 2 per cent in real terms , from £ 1.34 per litre in 2013 to £ 1.36 in 2030 , it says			1
added to improvements in fuel economy , this will ‘ reduce the effective cost of motoring ’ and persuade more people to drive , it says			0
@entity248 , @entity249 director of @entity11 said : ‘ this study is a warning of the worsening impact of gridlock on the @entity8 economy and on household budgets			2
‘ we now know that congestion will continue to have serious consequences for national and city economies , businesses and citizens in the years to come			0
if we think this problem is bad now , we are in for a terrible shock come 2030			0

annual cost of jams in the @entity8 will soar by 63 per cent to £ 21billion by 2030
congestion will cost the @entity8 economy £ 300billion over the next 16 years
@entity182 wasted 250 hours in traffic in 2013 , rising to 299 hours by 2030
