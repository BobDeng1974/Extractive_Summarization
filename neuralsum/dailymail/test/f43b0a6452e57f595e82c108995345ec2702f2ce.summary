saints very nearly hit right back with fresh - legged @entity67 believing he had cashed in on a @entity0 dropped ball with a try , only for the in - goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up			1
saints made a tactical switch at the break , with youngster @entity64 withdrawn and the backline reshuffled			0

@entity33 's goal made it 16 - 12 to the visitors			0

after a high kick was caught and returned quickly by @entity101 , @entity37 were soon back on the front foot , but a fumble by @entity122 on the halfway line turned the ball over			0
