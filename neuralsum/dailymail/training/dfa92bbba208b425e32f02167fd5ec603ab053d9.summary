by @entity0 the number of armed police officers could drop dramatically due to a watchdog 's plans to stop them conferring while writing up reports on shootings , it has been claimed			1
the @entity8 wants to make sure all armed police are separated from each other while writing up reports on shootings and the use of tasers			1
but a leading figure in @entity17 's @entity16 says the changes would see about half of armed police refuse to carry arms over fears they 'll be ' criminalised ' or put on trial for murder			1
a police chief has warned proposed changes to the way armed police report on shootings could lead to hundreds of officers refusing to carry guns			1
pictured : armed police outside the @entity31 in @entity17 police are currently given 48 hours after a shooting to produce a statement and can confer about events in the lead up to the incident			2
but the @entity8 want to stop officers conferring and force them to write up their report before they go off duty			1
commander @entity41 , @entity16 head of armed policing , says the changes would seriously hit his force 's ability to tackle gun crime and place even more pressure on armed officers			2
he said : ' we remain deeply concerned that the proposals will see officers being treated as suspects , separated from colleagues and questioned at what is always a traumatic and stressful time			0
' rather than assist an investigation we believe these proposals will greatly hinder the evidence - gathering process and prevent the best evidence from being obtained			0
' armed officers place themselves in harm 's way for the good of the public on a daily basis			2
they are highly - professional and dedicated individuals who deserve our support			0
' he fears more than 50 per cent of the @entity16 's 2,000 armed officers would refuse to carry a weapon if the changes were brought in , and far fewer officers would apply for the roles			0
commander @entity41 ( left ) , head of armed policing at @entity74 , says changes to how police shootings are reported would have a huge impact of tackling gun crime the @entity8 proposals come after the controversy surrounding the death of @entity82 , who was shot dead by police in @entity85 , north @entity17 in august 2011			1
his killing led to protests in the area , which turned into the riots which spread across @entity17 and @entity90 that summer			0
in that case , police officers spent eight hours together preparing their reports on the events leading up to shooting , days after the incident occurred			2
in january this year , an inquest jury concluded by a majority of eight to two that mr @entity99 was lawfully killed			0
the jury found unaminously that he had a gun with him in a minicab shortly before he was shot			0
they found it was more likely than not that he had thrown the weapon just before he was killed			0
a gun was found about 20 feet from the scene			0
the @entity8 later questioned the police use of a ' hard - stop ' tactic in the case , in which suspects are intercepted and confronted by armed officers			1
the @entity8 want to stop officers conferring when producing reports about shootings and wants them to complete the paperwork immediately instead of within 48 hours lawyers say the proposals could lead officers involved in shootings to refuse to take part in investigations for fear they 'll end up on trial for murder			1
commander @entity41 said that the @entity8 was protecting its own reputation after a survey found 80 per cent of armed officers lacked confidence in the changes			1
the same survey found that two thirds of the @entity16 police officers ' would think seriously ' about handing in their weapons if the plans changes were approved			0
the @entity8 was accused of mishandling the probe in the so - called ' @entity141 ' affair , in which cabinet minister @entity142 clashed with officers in @entity144 , and the watchdog was criticised earlier this year over investigations into deaths in custody			2
but the @entity8 's director of investigations , @entity149 , has backed the proposals , which would need to be approved by home secretary @entity152 before being brought in mr @entity149 said : ' separating officers after an incident , as soon as it is practical to do so , allows them to provide their accounts and importantly , and often overlooked , it adds integrity to their accounts and protects them from accusations of a cover up or collusion			2
' i believe that explainable inconsistencies are more credible than unexplainable consistencies			0
' the proposals we have put forward ... will increase public confidence in the police version of events , and help ensure our investigations are as robust and thorough as they can be			1

@entity8 have put forward changes to the way shooting reports are prepared
they propose to stop officers *speaking* to each other about statements
but police chief says the changes will ' criminalise ' officers and add to stress
he thinks the number willing to be armed will drop by half if changes made
follows controversy surrounding shooting of @entity82 in 2011
watchdog says proposals will boost public confidence in the police
