@entity1 announced the formation of @entity15 ( pronounced ' forward us ' ) in an op - ed article in the @entity18 yesterday			1
in it , he said the @entity20 needs a new approach to these issues if it is to get ahead economically			1
this , he wrote , includes offering talented , skilled immigrants a path to citizenship			2
' we have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants , @entity1 wrote			1
' and it 's a policy unfit for today 's world			2
' the move comes as a bipartisan @entity35 group is expected to roll out on a comprehensive immigration bill in the coming days			0
@entity1 's goal echoes the proposed legislation			1
he said he wants ' comprehensive immigration reform that begins with effective border security , allows a path to citizenship and lets us attract the most talented and hardest - working people , no matter where they were born			2
' of @entity49 extraction , @entity1 's interest in immigration stems from the fact that his own great - grandparents arrived as immigrants via @entity53 , to @entity20 , coupled with his experience teaching entrepreneurship at an after - school program			1

many will have to leave if we do n’t pass comprehensive immigration reform			0
' @entity1 also calls for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science , technology , engineering and maths			1
today 's knowledge and ideas - based economy , the 28 - year - old @entity114 dropout wrote , is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources , industrial machines and labour			2
