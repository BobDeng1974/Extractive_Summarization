the number of children being put up for adoption has fallen dramatically because social services are misinterpreting judicial guidance , it has been claimed			2
despite recent official figures which showed a record rise in youngsters being successfully adopted , experts fear the numbers being put forward have almost halved over the past year			1
they blame the decrease - some 47 per cent , according to umbrella group the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) - on fears over a @entity17 judgement from last year which highlighted concerns with too speedy adoptions			1
recent figures showed a record rise in children being successfully adopted , but experts fear numbers have halved in the past year			1
file photo @entity27 , the @entity28 , said last night : ‘ the last year has seen a record high in the number of adoptions - this means thousands more of our most vulnerable children are finding the loving and permanent homes they need			1
‘ however , we ’ve also seen a decrease in the number of children placed for adoption , because of a misinterpretation of the law following a number of significant judgements by the courts			2
‘ the new guidance published today by the @entity13 will help make clear the law around the correct interpretation of these complex cases and ensure the right decisions are being made each and every time			0
’ education secretary @entity49 said a campaign for more adoption was starting to bear fruit official figures published in september showed the number of children completing the adoption process in @entity56 had increased by 25 per cent to a record 5,000 in a single year			1
the news was celebrated by education secretary @entity49 as proof that a campaign for more adoption by her predecessor in the role , @entity65 , who was himself adopted , was starting to bear fruit			2
but last night , the @entity14 described what it said was a 47 per cent fall in children being put forward for adoption by local authorities as ‘ alarming ’			1
they said they were concerned that gains made in successfully placing children with new families were now at risk of being ‘ reversed ’			0
its chairman , former @entity80 ’s boss sir @entity78 , now the government ’s adoption tsar , issued emergency guidance to social services insisting that the law on adoptions had not changed despite a @entity17 judgment issued a year ago which highlighted concerns about the drive to speed up adoption			1
figures from the @entity14 showed the number of local authority decisions that a child should be adopted fell from 1,830 in the three months to september last year to 960 in the three months to june , a drop of 47 per cent			1
according to the board , the fall is in part an over-reaction to remarks by sir @entity101 , the president of the @entity102 , who attacked the ‘ anodyne and empty ’ arguments for enforced adoption presented at family courts , and accused social workers of paying lip service to the law , which says a child should be separated from its parents only in the most serious cases			0
he said in september : ‘ sloppy practice must stop			0
it is simply unacceptable in a forensic context where the issues are so grave and the stakes , for both child and parent , so high			0
’ he also criticised the ‘ recurrent inadequacy of the analysis and reasoning ’ used to support adoption and said four appeals in the last ten days of july alone had raised concerns			2
applications for court orders allowing a child to be placed for adoption have fallen by more than a third one ‘ lamentable ’ case at @entity131 in north @entity132 failed because of poor social work evidence and weak reasoning by a judge , he said			0
sir @entity101 , sitting in @entity132 ’s @entity136 , was speaking as he rejected an appeal into the adoption of two children in @entity141			0
he said ‘ lurking behind ’ the case were ‘ serious concerns and misgivings ’ about how family courts approach the issue of adoption			2
@entity149 , a member of the @entity150 and chief executive of the charity @entity152 , told the @entity153 last night : ‘ what we are concerned about [ is ] that we will see a reversal of the progress that was being made			0
‘ what we are seeing here … is what we believe to be an over-reaction and a misunderstanding of @entity164 judgments ; we are trying to do everything we can to address that			0
