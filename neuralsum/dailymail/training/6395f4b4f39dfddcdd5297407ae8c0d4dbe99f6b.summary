by @entity1 reporter published : 13:48 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 14:37 est , 29 august 2013 these peculiar portraits were created by a dedicated artist who spent every day for an entire year drawing a self - portrait using both hands			1
ambidextrous artist @entity6 , 53 , came up with the idea of his @entity8 as a way of being creative at least once a day			1
some days he would work for just one minute while others he would draw for hours - but the pictures always had to be finished that day			2
a year in the life : @entity6 stands before dozens of the portraits he created for his project the project lasted nearly 13 months with @entity6 , from @entity16 in @entity17 , completing 395 self - portraits			1
his unique talent meant that @entity6 could clench a pen or a paintbrush in both hands when creating his works			2
the technique , which he calls ' @entity25 ' , requires using movements with his left hand and firm movements with his right			1
@entity6 said his works were created through whatever means took his fancy that day			1
@entity6 describes his technique as ambidextrous impressionism - movements with left hand and firmer movements with his right hand nods to @entity38 and @entity39 ? @entity6 uses pens , pencils and paintbrushes he uses pens , pencils and paintbrushes , planned some works but spontaneously sketched others and used surfaces ranging from paper to cardboard , wood , shopping bags and canvases			1
he even let his hair grow for an entire year to help depict change			0
@entity6 said : ' there were days that i relished creating them and there were days that i grew bored of drawing myself again but no matter how tired i was i would do it			0
more experimental : there were days when @entity6 relished creating and days when he grew bored scary : several times @entity6 was travelling with friends and would pop out to the bathroom with paper and pencil in hand to work @entity6 was determined to finish at least one portrait per day discipline : @entity6 wrote comments about his portraits on @entity71 so he had to get on with it ' several times i was travelling and visiting friends and i 'd pop out to the bathroom with paper and pencil in hand , taping the paper to the mirror for a quick sketch			2
' but despite the trauma of having to look at my goofy face every day for hours at a time , no matter what happened on a particular day i knew i had accomplished this one artistic task			0
' there was no stopping because i had made a public commitment on @entity71 - i had to do the portraits			0
being watched was good motivation			0
' when drawing with two hands it 's like two people drawing side by side			0
it 's almost like a third artist has created them - i ca n't produce the same look using just one arm			0
