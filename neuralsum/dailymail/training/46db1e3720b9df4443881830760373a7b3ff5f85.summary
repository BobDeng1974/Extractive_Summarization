@entity0 is the great - granddaughter of @entity1 and says his story is even stranger than the fiction shown on the hit @entity5 show fans of the @entity5 series mr @entity1 probably think they know everything about the colourful @entity11 tycoon – from his trim , dark beard to his compulsive womanising and betrayal of his long - suffering wife			1
but the truth about @entity1 is very much stranger than that told in the hit show , according to one surviving member of his family			1
@entity0 , the great - granddaughter of the man who revolutionised @entity26 shopping , says the real story of mr @entity1 and his family includes @entity30 assassins , showgirls , drug scandals , a slide into poverty – and a bizarre tale of smuggled bull semen			1
mrs @entity0 has never spoken in public about the series and says she watches the show under sufferance			1
but when she was tracked down by @entity41 she was keen to set the record straight on a couple of key points : @entity1 was not unfaithful , she insists – and he did n’t even have a beard			1
‘ mr @entity1 is a story which is entertaining for the masses , but it is not necessarily fact , ’ she says with withering precision			1
‘ i was particularly annoyed by the portrayal of my great - grandfather			2
' he did not have affairs when his wife was alive , though he went slightly bananas after she died in the flu pandemic in 1918			0
‘ he made some bad decisions			0
he had a good time with the ladies , particularly the @entity59 , identical twin dancers who helped him spend his money			0
' then he discovered that one of them was taking a lot of drugs and he severed the relationship			0
‘ and i was disappointed that @entity66 has a beard – my great - grandfather never wore one			1
’ last sunday , mrs @entity0 watched a portrayal of her own grandmother @entity69 – @entity1 ’s daughter ( played by @entity71 ) – getting married in style to a @entity30 emigre , the rakish aviation pioneer @entity74			1
a shot from season three of mr @entity1 , starring @entity66 ( pictured third from right ) as @entity1 an undated photograph showing @entity1 with his daughter @entity80 's grandmother mrs @entity0 says : ‘ i thought @entity71 was very good as my grandmother , but they got the dates wrong			1
' i do know they all broke glasses [ during a toast ] but the wedding was completely different			0
' they married in a private ceremony at the chapel of the @entity92 in @entity93			0
’ mrs @entity0 was not convinced , either , by @entity95 ’s portrayal of the groom ’s mother , princess @entity96 , as a grasping woman			1
‘ my great - grandmother was a deeply religious woman and was n’t on the make , ’ she says			2
‘ her family had estates all over @entity30 but lost everything			0
her husband disappeared with the secret police at some stage and never came back			0
princess @entity107 ( pictured left ) and @entity109 and @entity110 with their baby @entity69 ( right ) ‘ and i ’m not convinced they are particularly accurate about grandpapa , who was quite a nervous chap			0
he was always worried that he was going to be assassinated by his political enemies in @entity30			0
‘ when he came over here , he had a cossack who used to sleep across the bedroom door , which my grandmother found quite trying , as you can imagine			0
‘ @entity120 was quite witty and charming and had an eye for the ladies , but i never heard any stories that he was tempted to go off with anyone else			0
’ now 70 , mrs @entity0 says @entity1 lavished money on his four children – @entity69 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 – and bankrolled their husbands			1
mrs @entity0 with the wedding dress that was handed down to her from grandmother @entity133 @entity69 ’s husband @entity109 tried – and failed – to become the first man to fly across the @entity136 after the @entity137 offered a £ 1,000 prize in 1908			1
after their marriage , the couple lived with @entity1 in @entity93 ’s @entity142 while @entity109 started a short - lived aviation company that only ever made one machine – a two - seat utility biplane that was illustrated in the 1919 edition of @entity147			2
despite his lack of success , the family enjoyed a wonderful sailing trip to @entity152 in @entity153 on @entity1 ’s steam yacht , @entity155 , as well as playing tennis on the roof of the department store and sitting in the front row at show premieres			1
@entity1 even installed a soda fountain in the store for his eldest daughter			2
eventually , @entity1 ’s spending spiralled out of control as the @entity166 hit his profits , and he was ousted from the board in 1941			2
when he ran into money troubles he moved to a flat in @entity171 , @entity93 , with @entity109 , @entity69 and mrs @entity0 ’s mother , @entity172			1
‘ he did n’t have any money , ’ mrs @entity0 recalls			1
‘ my grandmother once turned the bailiffs away and she had to go and work in the finance department at @entity177			2
‘ she did n’t want to be recognised , so she took the name mrs @entity179			0
’ @entity1 died in penury in 1947 , at the age of 90			2
mrs @entity0 was just three years old			1
despite their troubles , @entity172 was a debutante and married @entity185 , grandson of the @entity187 mp sir @entity186			0
they moved to @entity189 , where @entity185 worked as a farmer and geneticist			0
he was the author of the book @entity194			0
there was , however , one more scandal to hit the family			0
an undated picture of @entity1 with his mother , @entity200 , in @entity93 - she died in 1924 @entity185 was arrested for smuggling semen from @entity153 @entity203 cattle into @entity26 , which was used to inseminate @entity205 cows belonging to @entity206 and @entity26 agriculture adviser @entity207			1
‘ they stored the semen in my grandmother ’s fridge which she thought was outrageous , ’ mrs @entity0 reveals			1
‘ the resulting calves were exhibited at the @entity213 , but my father felt a hand on his shoulder in 1965 and was fined £ 50 for smuggling			0
‘ it was an extraordinary story but actually it has changed the dairy industry			0
’ in spite of their straitened circumstances , the family retained strong ties with @entity177 after its founder was ousted – @entity172 even had a discount card			2
‘ sadly the links have been severed now , ’ says mrs @entity0			1
‘ it ’s a shame because i would have loved that discount card			0
’ @entity1 ( centre ) at the christening of his granddaughters @entity69 and @entity127 in @entity233			2
