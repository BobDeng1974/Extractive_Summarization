three missing suspected @entity1 terrorists have given themselves up after officials in @entity3 put them on a plane to the wrong @entity6 airport			1
the men are understood to have been jailed by @entity1 on suspicion of spying after expressing a desire to return to @entity6 when they grew disillusioned with the group 's campaign of terror in @entity14 and @entity15			1
having escaped from their brutal captors , the men - who include the brother - in - law of @entity18 , the man who murdered seven people at a @entity21 school in @entity22 in march 2012 - handed themselves in at the @entity14 border with @entity3			2
but despite them having agreed to justice in @entity6 , @entity3 authorities managed to bungle the extradition - failing to put the men on an agreed flight to @entity28 and instead sending them to @entity29 without informing the @entity6 police , allowing the suspected terrorists to simply wander off on arrival			1
this allowed the men to simply pass through customs without causing suspicion and disappear , causing much embarrassment to @entity6 officials who had triumphantly announced in advance that the suspected terrorists would be arrested within minutes of their arrival at @entity53 airport			1
several hours after the men vanished , they once again handed themselves in - this time at a village police station the found after driving 105 miles north of @entity29			1
lawyers defending the men say they handed themselves in because they want prosecutors at any future trial to take their evidence seriously			0
' the three men handed themselves in because they want to be listened to by the authorities , ' lawyer @entity61 said , adding the men had been in touch with @entity6 authorities for several months before their return			2
' they were stunned not to have been questioned yesterday			0
' embarrassingly for the government , the case has come at a time when @entity6 is already on high security alert after militant group @entity69 threatened @entity6 targets			2
@entity6 has joined a @entity73 - led campaign of air strikes , hitting @entity69 targets in @entity15 last week			0
non arrival : @entity6 police were waiting for the suspected @entity1 militants to arrive at @entity53 ( pictured )			1
however bungling @entity3 officials put them of a different flight to @entity29 - some 450 miles to the south the mix - up in understood to have occurred after the pilot of the @entity28 - bound aircraft refused to let the men board the plane due to their status as suspected terrorists			1
instead of reporting the problem , @entity3 officials simply booked the men on to the next available @entity6 - bound flight - a passenger plane headed to @entity29 , some 450 miles from @entity28			1
one aspect that made the mix - up even more embarrassing for @entity6 authorities is that they were forced to backtrack on earlier claims the men were already in custody - admitting not only had they not yet been arrested , they had now disappeared without trace			0
@entity6 interior minister @entity97 said he had ordered an investigation of the case and said he would also travel shortly to @entity3 to ensure the errors were not repeated			0
an interior ministry official said the three men had long been under surveillance by security services			0
one of them , @entity106 , has already spent time in a @entity6 prison after being charged for links to a jihadist network in @entity15 in 2007			0
another of the three , @entity111 , is the brother - in - law of @entity18 , who killed seven people including three @entity21 children in @entity22 in march 2012 before police shot him dead			0
@entity116 , a lawyer advising @entity118 's wife , said the men had originally gone to @entity14 to live in a religious society			0
they had escaped @entity69 to hand themselves over to @entity3 officials because they had been terrified by the ' fanaticism ' there , he said .			2

suspected @entity1 *fighters* *deported* from @entity3 were to arrive at @entity53
but pilot of @entity28 - bound flight refused to take the men over *safety* concerns
@entity3 officials put group on next @entity6 - bound flight , heading to @entity29
they did not inform @entity6 police , who were waiting to arrest men in @entity28
on arrival in @entity29 the men passed through customs and wandered off
eventually handed themselves in , to the embarrassment of security officials
