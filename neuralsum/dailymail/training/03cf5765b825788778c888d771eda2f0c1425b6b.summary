most victims were 75 and over , and had medical conditions , such as heart and lung problems , made worse by the cold			0
last year ’s harsh winter was clearly a factor , along with high fuel bills and the fact that @entity37 homes are far colder and less insulated than those in many other parts of @entity40			1
the @entity41 is to provide an extra 2,500 hospital beds and 3,000 staff to help prevent a crisis in @entity45 this winter			1

the government ’s severe cuts to elderly care mean support is being withdrawn from homes and hundreds of thousands more older people are turning to hospital - they deserve much better			0

' older people can be physically frail but they have a lifetime 's wisdom and experience to share			0
health secretary @entity149 today gave details of how an extra £ 250 million for struggling @entity45 units will be spent this winter			2

' making sure older people have got a well insulated warm home and the income to pay the fuel bills is n’t green crap			0
it ’s what a decent society should do			0
' how can colder @entity215 countries avoid this annual toll while we simply wring our hands ?
