the number of children dying from cancer has dropped by 22 per cent in the last ten years , according to new figures			1
ten years ago around 330 children in the @entity5 died from cancer each year , but thanks to better treatments this has now dropped to around 260 each year			1
the steepest decline was in leukaemia , the most commonly diagnosed children ’s cancer , where death rates have almost halved , dropping from around 100 deaths each year to around 55			1
ten years ago around 330 children in the @entity5 died from cancer each year , but thanks to better treatments this has now dropped to around 260 each year ( file photo ) the figures are published today , at the start of @entity21 , by @entity23 charity which attributes much of the fall to tackling childhood cancers by combining a number of different chemotherapy drugs			1
the charity played a key role in the clinical trials that proved the benefits of these combined treatments , including a large international trial that has helped lead to liver cancer death rates falling by a quarter ( 26 per cent ) in the last decade			1
research to improve imaging and radiotherapy techniques is also playing a big part , it says			0
professor @entity39 , the director of the @entity40 in @entity41 , said ‘ it ’s very encouraging to see that fewer children are dying of cancer , but a lot more needs to be done			2
there are still a number of cancers where progress has been limited – such as brain tumours			0
‘ @entity23 ’s long - standing commitment to clinical trials for children with cancer has been a major factor in developing today ’s treatments and is pivotal to ongoing research that will offer new hope to the children and their families			2
‘ many children who survive cancer will live with the long - term side effects of their treatment that can have an impact throughout their adult lives , so it ’s vital that we find kinder and even more effective treatments for them			0
’ around 1,600 children are diagnosed with cancer every year in the @entity5			1
overall survival for childhood cancer has tripled since the 1960s , and three quarters of children with cancer are now cured ( file photo ) the new figures are announced as @entity23 and @entity79 celebrate the 10th anniversary of their partnership and the @entity83 campaign , the @entity5 ’s biggest clothes collection			1
since 2004 , @entity79 has raised £ 13.2m to help @entity23 find ways to beat children ’s cancers sooner , funding research into many areas including developing better treatments that also reduce the long - term side effects for children with cancer			0
to mark the occasion , @entity79 will fund the @entity5 ’s participation in an international children ’s cancer trial led by professor @entity97 to improve survival for children and young people with a type of brain tumour called ependymoma			2
since 2004 , @entity79 has raised £ 13.2m to help @entity23 find ways to beat children ’s cancers sooner these tumours are often aggressive and difficult to treat and better therapies are urgently needed to improve survival and quality of life for young people and their families affected by this devastating disease			0
professor @entity97 , from the @entity114 , said ‘ @entity23 has made clinical trials possible that have led to great improvements in treatments for childhood cancers			0
however , ependymoma brain tumours are exceptionally difficult to treat and survival rates remain poor			0
’ around 1,600 children are diagnosed with cancer every year in the @entity5			1
overall survival for childhood cancer has tripled since the 1960s , and three quarters of children with cancer are now cured			0
@entity127 , @entity23 ’s chief executive said ‘ we ’ve made great progress in helping more and more children survive cancer than ever before , but this work is not finished – better , kinder treatments must continue to be our target			0
our researchers are making great strides every year to help even more children beat the disease			2

ten years ago around 330 @entity5 children died each year , now down about 260
@entity21 begins today to *highlight* issues
steepest decline was in leukaemia , where death rates have almost halved
