by @entity1 reporter published : 23:09 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 29 may 2013 @entity2 has cornered the market for a surprising new demographic - the @entity5			1
the social networking site has become one of the must - have accessories for thousands of @entity5 teens during their @entity11 years - when they cast off their parents ' rules and experiment with technology , popular culture , alcohol and even sex and drugs			1
@entity2 has become a way for @entity5 teens to meet other @entity5 , organize parties and brag to their friends about their new ' @entity23 ' ( @entity25 ) haircuts , and lifestyle			1
but teens on @entity11 post pictures of themselves - just like teens in the modern world getting together : teens use @entity2 to date - but usually only other @entity5			1
@entity36 is often seen by elders as a time to find a spouse strange : the marriage of @entity5 , cell phones and @entity2 made this entirely bizarre post possible			1
this teen has apparently borrowed his father 's horse and buggy to go meet his friends ' they love the stuff , but they do n’t have a lot of experience with it , ' @entity47 , who counsels @entity5 teens about drug and alcohol abuse , told @entity55			1
@entity2 and smartphones allow many @entity5 teens to fall into the same patterns of social media use as their @entity25 peers			1
they post ' selfie ' photos , images of their drunken friends at parties and pictures of themselves in @entity25 clothes			1
for most @entity5 , even sitting for a photograph is considered prideful and not in keeping with the rules of the community			2
social media has also allowed for massive booze - fueled parties			1
@entity72 , 22 , who recently left the @entity5 , says teens have gotten smart about not posting details about parties on @entity2 because they know cops could be reading			1
new recruit : @entity2 has become a ubiquitous feature if @entity11 for many @entity5 teens this @entity5 teenager shows off his new , modern haircut and sunglasses , as his family 's buggy sits in the background simple life : smartphones have allowed for young @entity5 to share their daily lives - just like teens in the ' @entity23 ' ( @entity25 ) world ' there are a lot of underagers , so they will forward a text message around with the address , time , and whatever of the party , ' he told @entity55			1
because @entity2 allows @entity5 teens to dramatically widen their social circles			1
a party that might have attracted a few dozen teens from a few neighboring farm communities now draws hundreds - sometimes from different states			0
' we used to have parties , but it was not this easy to find them			0
now it does n’t take long to set it up and 700 kids show up			0
everyone is connected , everyone is texting everyone , ' @entity47 said			0
sex remains to verboten topic - even on @entity2			2
@entity72 says teens still look at online pornography and they often troll dating sites like @entity120			0
however , this is usually not talked about			0
group picture : as this picture reveals , some @entity5 teens choose to adopt modern clothes , while others choose to wear their traditional garb ' @entity128 ' : these bonnet - wearing girls took a group picture together			1
it 's unclear whether the ' duck face ' has made it to the @entity5 community yet play hard : this photo depicts a scene closer to a @entity138 bachelor party - not a group of @entity5 teens on night out @entity11 has been portrayed in popular culture as a hedonistic time of no - holds - barred partying for @entity5 teens			1
the rite of passage - usually between age 14 and 16 - allows young @entity5 to experience the outside world , including technology , and defy the rules of their parents			0
however , most teens never actually leave home on @entity11 , and the vast majority decide to join the church and stay with the @entity5 community when @entity11 ends			2
it is true the @entity5 teens often drink alcohol at parties - usually with their parents ' knowledge			1
some experiment with sex and illegal drugs			0
most @entity5 boy and girls , though , live at home during @entity166 and only party on the weekends			0
when they do party , it is nearly always with other @entity5 on @entity11			0
even with vast new - found freedom , many @entity5 teens ca n't bear to stray far from home or from their traditional values			1
ironically , @entity2 expands the world for most @entity5 teens - but only opens it enough so they can meet other @entity5			1
most @entity5 teens on @entity11 are n't interested in dating non-amish or even necessarily socializing with them			2
largely , @entity2 has became a way for @entity5 teens to meet other @entity5 teens			1
' it serves [ as ] an insulating social network - one more way that @entity5 youth socialize only with other @entity5 youth - rather than a means of expanding @entity5 social circles , ' @entity187 , a professor a @entity188 in @entity189 who studies the @entity5 , told the @entity191 in 2011			2
most @entity5 teens use smartphones - iphones are the most coveted - because they can be easily charged using solar power strips			1
contrary to popular belief , most teens on @entity11 still live with their parents , meaning it 's not feasible to own computers			0
despite the very modern obsession with social networking , photography and meeting people online , there is one place @entity5 teens draw the line - video games			1
the teens who become obsessed with @entity208 or @entity209 are ridiculed			0
' they kind of think it is stupid			0
they are very practical ; they think it is childish , ' @entity47 , the @entity5 counselor , said			0
@entity11 , which takes place for teens between ages 14 and 16 in most @entity5 communities , is seen as a time of courtship			2
however , it is also a time when teens are free of their parents rules			0
at the end of @entity11 , the teens must choose whether to be baptized as @entity5 as rejoin the community or whether to abandon their families and way of life for the modern world			2
bragging rights : @entity2 has allowed @entity5 teens to gather in the hundreds to gather for booze - fueled parities driving no longer requires a horse - drawn buggy for the wealthiest teens on @entity11			1
this guy bought a new @entity239 pickup truck modern clothes : teens often buy new sets of clothing to go with their new lifestyle in the modern world the vast majority of teens choose the @entity5 life			2
one @entity249 in @entity250 , @entity251 , said @entity5 youths have always been curious about trying new technologies			0
@entity2 is just the latest			0
' when automobiles came out , some @entity5 rode in automobiles			0
when @entity256 became popular , some @entity257			0
most anything that comes along , some @entity5 kids will pick it up , ' the man told the @entity191			0
there is some evidence that @entity2 has an even wider use among @entity5 youths than just those teens on @entity11			2
cell phones have recently come into use in @entity5 businesses and some more liberal bishops have allowed their members to use social media to market their shops and wares			1
there is no way to cell for certain how many @entity5 kids are on @entity2 , but some church leaders have begun to speak out against the site			2
' this is something no proper @entity5 would endorse			0
kids can get themselves in trouble , ' a @entity280 told the @entity191			0
part of the problem with @entity2 and cell phone use among young @entity5 - whether on @entity11 or not - is that parents and older leaders in the community have a difficult time fathoming the technology and how it really works .			2

@entity2 and smartphones allow many @entity5 teens to fall into the same patterns of social media use as their @entity25 peers
they post ' selfie ' photos , images of their drunken friends at parties and pictures of themselves in @entity25 clothes
