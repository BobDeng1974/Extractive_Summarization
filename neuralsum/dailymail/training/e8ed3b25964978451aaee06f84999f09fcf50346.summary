a filmmaker has created a nailbiting video of a group of daredevils attempting to tightrope walk between two hot - air balloons			1
filmmaker @entity6 shot the exploits of a group of @entity10 adventurers who call themselves @entity11 as they attempted the death - defying feat. the group strung up a line between two hot - air balloons then launched them high into the skies before attempting to walk across the tightrope			1
many were wearing small cameras on their heads to capture first - person footage of the exhilarating stunt			0
none of the footage shows the tightrope walkers drifting to the ground on parachutes , but presumably that 's what the tiny packs on their backs contain			0
three 's a crowd : a third balloon of observers watches the two joined ones high rise : the first tightroper edges out into the open air fine line : the rope looks slack and the walker has difficulty keeping his balance as he is buffeted by the wind skyliners describe themselves as ' a group of flying frenchies , ' whose passions are ' highlining , basejumping , mountaineering and much more			2
' @entity67 , whose childhood in the @entity70 fueled his passion for the outdoors and sports , has been following and filming the group for several years and recently released a film about @entity76 , @entity66 ) is about @entity77 and @entity78 who pioneered ' highlining , ' a vertiginous combination of climbing , slackline and tightrope walking			0
the fall : the walker loses his balance , holding the rope briefly before falling to the ground @entity88 : a camera on this walker 's head shows exactly what he can see wobbly : it 's incredible the @entity11 can take any steps at all free falling : the walker loses his balance and falls to the cheers of his team while none of the @entity11 were successful in their first hot - air balloon tightroping bid , the crew intend to make another attempt within @entity107 hot - air balloon is the oldest successful human - carrying flight technology			1
the very first untethered balloon was launched from @entity110 in 1783 by @entity111 and @entity112 .			0

a group of @entity10 daredevils tightrope walked between two hot - air balloons
the group call themselves @entity11 and describe themselves as a group of flying @entity120
none managed to get the entire way across before falling - but were presumably wearing parachutes
they plan to attempt the feat again soon
