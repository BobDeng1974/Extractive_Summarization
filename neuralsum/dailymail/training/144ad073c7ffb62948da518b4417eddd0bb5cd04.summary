@entity4 was knocked unconscious after the fish suddenly jumped from the water and slammed into his head			1
he was airlifted to hospital in serious condition with a double fracture of the skull following the terrifying encounter with the four foot long fish in @entity13			2
freak accident : @entity4 is pictured in the neck brace he must now wear as he recovers from a fractured skull he got from an airborne sturgeon that leapt over his family 's boat the youngster is now recovering at home but has to wear a neck brace until further medical tests are carried out			1
two other children , his nephew @entity25 , 14 , and 16 - year - old daughter were also struck			0
‘ it happened so quick , and it was a big fish , ’ said @entity4 ’s father @entity27			2
‘ when i saw it come over the boat it was too late			0
but i yelled , " watch out ! " ' massive : while on the @entity33 near @entity34 , @entity13 , a 4 - foot sturgeon like this one jumped into the air and struck @entity4 , leaving his bleeding from the nose and ears he said the fish leapt from the river and struck the children while he was preparing to dock the family ’s 16 - foot boat on the @entity33 near @entity34 , @entity13 , last month			1
@entity27 said his son was bleeding from his ears and mouth after being struck			0
‘ it was the scariest moment of my life , ’ he said			0
according to the @entity53 in the @entity52 area can grow up to 200 pounds and 8 feet in length			1
@entity55 said the sturgeon that struck his son was at least 4 feet in length and may have weighed 100 pounds			1
in the spring , sturgeon migrate from saltwater to freshwater , where they live through the summer			0
during that time , rivers in the @entity63 are highly populated by the fish , said @entity66 spokesman @entity65			0
mystery : @entity13 rivers like the @entity33 ( pictured ) are the summer home to sturgeon that can reach 200 pounds and leap six feet in the air , though scientists do n't know why the fish do it @entity4 is the second person to be injured by an airborne sturgeon on the @entity33 in the last 11 years , according to @entity66			1
@entity75 , of @entity76 , suffered a collapsed lung , broken sternum , several broken ribs , and damage to internal organs when he was struck in the chest by an airborne sturgeon in 2002			0
he had been fishing on the @entity33			2
scientists are unsure why sturgeon leap from the water , but @entity88 fish biologist @entity87 said it could be a way for the fish to communicate with each other			2
‘ another idea , ’ @entity87 said , ‘ is that they ’re actually jumping to keep balance in their swim bladder , which is the organ that helps to maintain buoyancy underwater			0
but the short answer is we just do n’t know why they jump			0
’ @entity87 said sturgeon can leap as high as six feet above the water			1
and though it ’s rare that sturgeon strike people , @entity65 urges boaters on the @entity33 to slow down and be observant			1
