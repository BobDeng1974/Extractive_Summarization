by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 12:51 est , 4 may 2012 a woman who fell in love with planes as a nine - year - old child when she was invited to sit in a cockpit has become one of @entity8 's youngest women pilots aged just 25			1
@entity10 's achievements in a male - dominated industry prove she 's got substance and style			1
having graduated in aviation technology from the @entity15 , @entity10 has carved out a career in an industry where fewer than five per cent of pilots are women			1
life 's ambition : @entity10 has become one of @entity8 's youngest female airline pilots after securing a job with @entity26 - based firm @entity25 in an industry with fewer than five percent of pilots are women @entity10 , a pilot for @entity26 - based airline @entity25 , said : ' as far back as i can remember , i have always been interested in flying			1
' the turning point was when i was able to sit with the pilots in the flight deck			2
i was nine years old and the captain asked if i wanted to sit there while the plane landed			2
' from that moment on , @entity10 was single - minded in her pursuit to become a pilot choosing science and mathematics over the arts - ' any subject geared towards a career in flying '			1
after graduating from university , @entity10 struggled to find a job in the midst of the recession			1
in the hot seat : @entity10 fell in love with planes as a nine - year - old and graduated in aviation technology from the @entity15			1
but after failing to find a job , she turned her attention to flying instead but she successfully applied to flight training @entity53 ( @entity55 ) and attended an aviation school in @entity57 where she also secured a position on the @entity25 mentoring programme			2
she spent 14 months at flight school getting 800 hours of ground school under her belt and taking on 14 subjects including flight navigation , radio navigation , principals of flight and meteorology			2
in order to continuing training , every candidate has to get a pass mark of at least 90 per cent in each exam - something @entity10 achieved			1
at @entity10 gained her commercial pilot 's licence enabling her to fly a small four - seater , single - engine aircraft			1
' i got the aviation bug ' : @entity10 is starting her career with £ 80,000 worth of debt accumulated from paying for the 14 - month intensive live - in course at the @entity57 flight school and a pilot loan she then moved on to a six - seater twin engine aircraft and then a @entity84			1
potential pilots must also gain their instrument rating , to enhance their skills and proficiency to a higher , safer level			2
@entity10 said : ' you need to know the mechanics and principals around how the aircraft works - i know more about my aircraft than my car			1
' she recalled : ' the first time i got control of a @entity84 was at @entity98 when i had to do six take offs and landings			0
' the aircraft was empty of passengers and i had to fly it from @entity104 to @entity98 i did the landings and then we flew back			0
it 's an amazing feeling			0
' recently the @entity108 , who moved to @entity110 , @entity26 , after getting a job with @entity25 , realised a long - held dream of flying into her home city airport			0
' i had this ambition to fly there and i finally got to do that			0
' i 'm getting paid to do my hobby - how many people can say that ? there has never been a time when i have wanted to do anything else			0
' it 's an expensive hobby			0
@entity10 is starting her career with £ 80,000 worth of debt accumulated from paying for the 14 - month intensive live - in course at the @entity57 flight school and a pilot loan			1
she said : ' i guess that money could have been put towards a house and i will to paying it off over a long period			0
' however it is all worth it in the end as it setting me up for a lifelong career , so the positives far outweigh the negatives			0
' as a newly qualified pilot , most of @entity10 's salary will be eaten up paying for rent and paying off the loan - most loans are payable within seven years			2
fortunately , she can expect to be a captain on a @entity84 or a first officer on a jet within three years boosting her salary as with any profession , salaries increase with experience			0
figures from october 2011 show that a direct entry captain for @entity25 can earn up to £ 82,000 compared to £ 81,509 with @entity155 and £ 65,000 with @entity156			0
the high debt and comparatively low starting salaries mean it 's not a career for the not - quite sure			0
@entity10 said : ' i 've got the aviation bug			2
it 's a lot of hard work training to become a pilot but it 's so rewarding in the end			0

@entity10 qualifies in industry where only five per cent of pilots are women
