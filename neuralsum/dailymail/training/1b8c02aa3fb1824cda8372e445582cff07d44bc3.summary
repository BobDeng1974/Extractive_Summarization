by @entity0 , @entity1 shooter @entity3 's bid to become the outright most successful @entity6 athlete of all time is over after he missed out on a place in the final of the 50m air pistol			1
the 60 - year - old grandfather from @entity12 , competing at his sixth games , had drawn level with fellow shooter @entity15 on saturday when he won his 18th medal , taking bronze in the 10m discipline			1
blow : @entity3 has missed out on the chance to become the most successful @entity6 athlete of all time @entity3 said afterwards that he had achieved what he came out of retirement for , and that he would be ' chillaxing ' when he stepped back on to the range for monday 's event			1
and , despite shooting a competitive total of 529 from his six rounds , he bowed out of the competition in 13th place			2
afterwards @entity3 confirmed he would be hanging up his gun competitively , ruling out another tilt at a 19th medal in @entity36 in four years			1
' i wanted to give it a little bash and try to get the all - time record , ' he said			1
' but unfortunately the bullets i used would n't go into the middle of the target			0
they kept flying into the nine ring , or sometimes the eight ! ' it was a case of not enough 10s today			0
i was trying - i was n't too chillaxed			1
i gave it my best shot but my body was telling me it 's time to pack up			2
my legs are burning and i 've got a trapped nerve in my back , so it 's time to call it a day			2
' @entity3 does want to stay involved in shooting , however , and hopes to take up a coaching @entity58 also revealed he would dedicate saturday 's record - equalling bronze to @entity61 , with his wife @entity62 suffering from the disease			2
' i 've sacrificed the family a bit , going away from home twice a week to train , leaving my wife on her own , ' he added			0
' the last year has been pretty bad			2
my mum got cancer and then @entity62 got pneumonia			0
that will do : @entity3 celebrates winning the @entity73 medal in the @entity74 gold : 25m standard pistol , @entity77 : 10m air pistol , @entity79 : 10m air pistol pairs , @entity79 : 50m pistol , @entity79 : 10m air pistol , @entity82 : 10m air pistol pairs , @entity82 : 50m pistol , @entity82 : 50m pistol pairs , @entity82 : 50m pistol , @entity85 : 10m air pistol pairs , @entity87 : 10m air pistol pairs , @entity89 : 50m pistol , @entity89 : 25m centre fire pistol , @entity91 : 10m air pistol , @entity93 : 25m standard pistol pairs , @entity95 : 50m pistol pairs , @entity96 : 25m standard pistol , @entity98 : 50m pistol pairs , @entity85 1994 ' the amount of effort i 've put in - i 've got 40 years of experience behind me , i 've shot millions of rounds and hit millions of 10s			1
the actual sacrifices have been tremendous - we have n't had a holiday in 20 years , so we 'll have one now			2
' the wife has told me this is definitely the last one			0
i 've put myself through an awful lot and @entity62 's frightened i might have a heart attack			0
' but it was worth it			0
i 'm the most successful @entity6 athlete in the history of the @entity114 - well , joint with that @entity36 chap , but we wo n't be speaking about him			1
' i might come back as a coach			0
we 'll wait and see			0
i 've got a hell of a lot of experience to pass on			0
' the medal i won , i 'm dedicating to the @entity124 's society as my wife has had @entity124 's for 10 or 15 years so we need to do something about that			0
' now i 'm going to put my gun away , watch the final , then get in the car and drive home			1
i signed off with a couple of 10s , which was nice , and that 's it			0
' there will be @entity138 interest in monday afternoon 's final after 21 - year - old @entity140 shot a personal best to qualify in second place			1
out with a bang : @entity3 confirmed he would be hanging up his gun competitively			1
