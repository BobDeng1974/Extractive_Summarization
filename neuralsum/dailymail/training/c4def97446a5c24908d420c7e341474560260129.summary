and have an initial mass production of 10 tons a year starting in 2015 by @entity1 published : 10:50 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 11:28 est , 27 may 2013 a @entity3 company has created an electric blue dress made of synthetic spider silk			1
the company , named @entity7 , have made the garment to demonstrate the different ways that the incredibly strong yet lightweight material can be used			2
their artificial fibre based on spider silk is called @entity13 , from the @entity3 word ' kumonosu ' meaning ‘ spider web ’			1
if the silk was used to make body armour , it would be at least three times stronger than @entity33 , depending on the spider			1
@entity35 begins in the spinning gland as a random coil of proteins before it is passed through ducts in precise conditions of acidity , water content and chemical concentration			0
it is then pushed out of the spider ’s body through a spinning wart			2
the fibre that emerges is water - resistant , partly crystal and partly coiled			0
the silk has been used in wound dressings , as it has antibacterial properties			0
looks are deceiving : despite its fragile appearance , spider silk is incredibly strong			1
the silk is composed of a complex structure of fibrils which , gram for gram , make it stronger than many metals spiders secrete their silk through a special gland called a spinning wart			2
the fibre that emerges is water insoluble , partly crystal and coiled the high - collared cocktail dress , on display at the @entity71 complex in @entity72 , was created to demonstrate the technology behind @entity75 , according to a report by cnet			0
scientists are increasingly interested in the silk because they believe it could be used for everything from parachute cords to artificial blood vessels			0
but the territorial nature of spiders makes it very difficult to farm spiders like silkworms			0
in the absence of prey they will readily resort to cannibalism too			0
spider silk ( the synthetic version pictured here , on reels ) is five times stronger than steel and if it was used to make body armour , it would be three times stronger than @entity33 spiders also only produce minute amounts of silk , spinning only what they need for a web , then consuming any excess it has ' spun '			1
the blue dress is not the first garment to be made from spider silk			1
last year an exhibition at the @entity110 showcased a yellow cape made from the silk of a @entity113			2
the spider , from @entity115 creates orb - shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than @entity33			1
juvenile males also weave spider webs , but once they become adults , they abandon this behaviour and instead direct their energies solely to sex			0
for survival , the @entity124 's bark spider relies in part on its mottled , jagged appearance , which camouflages the spider against trees and - along with @entity124 - inspired its name			0
an analysis of the @entity124 's bark spider 's silk indicates it 's the toughest biological material discovered to date			0
in nature , spider silk is spun into threads , but in laboratory conditions the same proteins have been rearranged into spheres , thin films and capsules			2
one team of @entity144 scientists even tried to make spider silk by genetically modifying goats to produce spider silk protein in their milk			1
@entity7 have created a manmade version using synthesised genes which coax bacteria to produce fibroin , a structural protein found in spider silk			1
@entity7 then uses the technology to culture the microbes efficiently and weave the fibroin into fabric			2
the company , a spinoff from @entity72 's @entity162 , has applied for 16 patents on its spider silk technology			1
it is also teaming up with car parts maker @entity166 to build a plant that can turn out about 220 pounds of the synthetic silk a month			1
@entity7 hopes to have an initial mass production of 10 tons a year starting in 2015			1
‘ this fabric can be used in various industries , such as automobiles and medicine , ' @entity171 president @entity170 told the @entity177 newspaper			0
‘ it is a major first step toward a manufacturing process that does not depend on petroleum			0
’ even in the minute quantities in which it can be gathered , it has found a number of uses - as a fishing line , or in the crosshairs of optical instruments .			0

@entity7 have created the silk using synthesised genes which coax bacteria to produce fibroin , a structural protein found in spider silk
spider silk is at least five times stronger than steel , more flexible than nylon and three times stronger than body armour @entity33
company hopes to produce 220 pounds of the synthetic silk a month and have an initial mass production of 10 tons a year starting in 2015
