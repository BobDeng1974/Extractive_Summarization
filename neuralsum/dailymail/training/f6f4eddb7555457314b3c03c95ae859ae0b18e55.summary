i could n’t believe it when i learnt i would n’t be paid for all the time i was working			2

' during a debate in the @entity24 on wednesday , ms @entity16 said @entity7 thought she had landed her dream job with the airline			0
she said : ' it was not until she started that she learned she would not be paid for all the hours she put in , only the time when a plane she was working on was in the air			1
mp @entity16 ( left ) accused @entity80 's ( right ) airline of using the tactics to help achieve record profits of nearly half a billion pounds ' that meant not a penny for every pre-flight briefing she attended , nothing for sales meetings , nothing for turnaround time when a plane was on the ground between flights , and nothing for the hours waiting on the tarmac during delays and flight cancellations			0
