by @entity0 last updated at 9:16 pm on 6th december 2011 @entity1 , the former @entity2 chairwoman who authorised a boardroom surveillance probe that ultimately sullied her remarkable rise from investment bank typist to the corporate upper class , has died after a long bout with cancer			1
ms @entity1 , 58 , died on sunday at her home in @entity10 , @entity11 , surrounded by her family			0
her sister @entity13 said ms @entity1 's ovarian cancer had returned			2
once one of the most powerful women in corporate america , ms @entity1 saw her career tarnished in 2006 when she was ousted from @entity2 and brought up on criminal charges - which were ultimately dropped - for approving the company 's plan to snoop into the private phone records of board members , journalists and @entity2 employees to catch people leaking to the media			1
scandal : former @entity2 chairwoman @entity1 attends a hearing at @entity31 in october 2006 the scandal unfolded as ms @entity1 continued to battle a disease that had haunted her through a sparkling investment banking career and a stormy nine - year stretch on the board of @entity2 , one of the world 's largest technology companies			1
she had spent time on philanthropic matters in the years since the scandal , ms @entity13 said			0
she said she wanted people to remember her sister 's ' incredibly influential rise in her professional life and her courage and valiant battles over the course of her treatments '			2
ms @entity1 's time at @entity2 coincided with some of the most contentious and challenging periods since the @entity52 - based company was founded in 1939			1
she joined @entity2 's board in 1998 and was instrumental in the hiring and firing of chief executive @entity55 , whose flamboyant personality and ferocity in securing the 19 billion - dollar purchase of @entity59 ultimately helped hasten her departure amid a sagging stock price and disappointing results from the combined company			1
ms @entity1 was the one who announced ms @entity55 's sacking in february 2005 and named her low - key successor , @entity65 , previously ceo of @entity66			2
mr @entity65 himself was ousted last year after an investigation into a sexual harassment claim found inconsistencies in expenses reports filed			0
ousted : @entity1 , left , with @entity65 , former president of @entity2 who was suspended from the company last year following inconsistencies in expenses reports filed ms @entity1 also assumed ms @entity55 's role as chairwoman at the time			1
but she was forced out of that role in september 2006 in an embarrassing scandal involving spying on the telephone records of board members and journalists to ferret out the source of leaks to the media			1
just a month later , @entity11 's attorney general charged ms @entity1 and four others with four counts each of conspiracy , fraud , identity theft and illegally using computer data			2
that came just two days before she started chemotherapy treatments for advanced ovarian cancer			0
the criminal charges against ms @entity1 were eventually dropped , as prosecutors said she had little involvement in the actual ' pretexting ' - the ruse used by investigators to view private telephone records by pretending to be someone else - and because of her ailing health			1
charges against the other defendants were also dropped , with a @entity31 judge calling their conduct ' a betrayal of trust and honour ' at worst that was not criminal behaviour at the time it occurred			1
once an aspiring investigative reporter , ms @entity1 , a graduate of the @entity112 , found more immediate and lucrative work in the financial world and made her mark in investment banking			0
after working briefly as a part - time reporter for a community newspaper in @entity120 , she began her corporate climb by capitalising on a temporary typist job that she landed at an investment firm in the 1970s			0
public address : @entity1 speaks , after being inducted into the @entity125 of the @entity126 , during a dinner in @entity120 she was able to turn the two - week typing assignment into full - time work and managed to quickly rise through the ranks by earning a reputation as a hard - edged businesswoman			0
that reputation eventually helped her earn the promotion to ceo of fund management behemoth @entity135 in 1995			0
but ms @entity1 's life had been far from charmed			2
financial difficulties dogged her family throughout her childhood and her father , a vaudeville actor , died of a heart attack before she was a teenager			0
after his death the family moved to @entity145 , north of @entity120 , and her mother 's emotional health deteriorated			0
she later died of breast cancer			0
it was at the height of ms @entity1 's corporate success when she was diagnosed with cancer herself , forcing her to step down in 2002 from her role as @entity135 ceo to fight breast cancer and melanoma			0
two years later she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and in autumn 2006 she underwent surgery for a metastasised tumour - three weeks before the public learned of the @entity2 investigation that spawned congressional investigations , criminal probes and forced ms @entity1 's resignation			1
ms @entity1 is survived by her husband @entity163 ; three adult children , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 ; 10 grandchildren ; a brother , @entity169 , and sister ms @entity13 .			1
