the parents of two ' best friend ' sisters @entity15 and @entity16 , who were killed in a car crash while on holiday in @entity5 , will never know what caused the accident after @entity10 agents were unable to find any information from @entity5 authorities @entity15 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) were both students at university			1
a senior coroner today criticised foreign governments and agencies for making it increasingly difficult to obtain evidence into @entity10 citizens dying abroad @entity42 , a 21 - year - old law student at @entity43 , was driving a @entity44 northbound on the @entity45 , just 14km south of the town of @entity48			1
she and her elder sister @entity16 , a 23 - year - old media student at @entity50 in @entity51 who was sitting in the front passenger seat , died at the scene from multiple traumatic injuries			1
the inquest , at @entity56 , @entity57 , heard their car lost control and veered across the carriageway at around 5am local time			1
their friend @entity63 , then 21 , was a backseat passenger in the car when it struck a @entity67 coming in the opposite direction and spun into a head - on collision with a 4x4			0
mr @entity63 was seriously injured in the collision along with four other people , while five people were treated for minor injuries			0
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity63 had arrived in @entity5 together two days earlier on september 15 2012 on their travels through @entity76 , where they also visited @entity78			1

mr @entity87 today said that despite attempts to ascertain why @entity15 lost control , the @entity88 were unable to produce evidence for the inquest			1
the pair ( @entity16 , left , and @entity15 , right ) had been travelling across @entity76 before they were tragically killed he added the @entity5 authorities may not have even conducted any investigation at all and that @entity63 was unable to help with evidence because he was asleep at the time			1
he added that during his time as a coroner , his investigations have been hampered because he has encountered such problems more regularly in recent years			0
resuming an inquest into their deaths in southern @entity5 on september 17 2012 , mr @entity87 today said : ' this has taken two and a half years to get to this stage			2
' the reason it 's taken such a long time is the efforts of the @entity88 to liaise through diplomatic channels with the @entity5 government			2
' a state representative said there have been numerous attempts to secure results of investigations carried out			2
' while there is a responsibility on a coroner to carry out an investigation the trouble is we do n't always get evidence from crime scenes in relation to that investigation			2
' we rely on the corporations , foreign governments and the agencies in those foreign countries to assist and sadly in this case the @entity88 's attempts to get evidence into the deaths of both @entity15 and @entity16 has failed			1
' this happens , sadly , and the problem is increasing in recent years			0
i 'm not going to say anything further on the subject but it makes our ability to carry out investigations very difficult			0
' trip of a lifetime : the sisters and their friend had been holidaying in @entity5 when the accident happened near @entity150 ( pictured ) recording verdicts of death by road traffic collision , he added : ' i 'm sorry our efforts to produce more information in relation to their deaths and perhaps to how @entity15 came to lose control of the vehicle have not produced results			1
' it may be the case there was no investigation as would have normally been the case if an incident occurred in @entity169 and @entity170			0
we have bespoke road traffic collision investigators			0
' they were driving to this remote location of this particular incident and that may be why our efforts have not produced anything more substantial			0
' he continued : ' i offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends and on that note i bring the inquest finally to a close			2
' their heartbroken parents @entity186 and @entity187 parents told of their ' complete devastation ' and said their daughters had brought ' light and laughter to whoever met them ' in statements released at the time of their deaths			0

' they made a difference to so many lives and they lit up every room on entering			0
' this trip was to be an adventure of a lifetime for which they had planned , worked hard and saved together for months to be able to do			2
' both girls were about to enter their final years at university with @entity16 , who had been offered a job in @entity226 , looking at a career in journalism and @entity15 in law			1
