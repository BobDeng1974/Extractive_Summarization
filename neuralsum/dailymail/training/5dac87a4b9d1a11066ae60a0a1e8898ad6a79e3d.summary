' nothing short of appalling ' : @entity1 , from @entity2 , has been jailed for three and a half years a photographer who infected a lover with @entity5 by failing to tell her he had the disease has been jailed for three - and - a - half years			1
@entity1 did not inform the woman , referred to only as x in court , he had the disease before they started a sexual relationship			1
the 48 - year - old had denied causing x grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury after a trial			1
prosecutors said @entity17 , who publicly apologised to his victim through his barrister , had a ' cavalier ' attitude to sex and disregard for the safety of others			1
at @entity27 yesterday judge @entity26 branded @entity28 ' utterly irresponsible and selfish			2
' the judge told him : ' at no time during the relationship did you inform @entity8 of your hiv positive status			1
' worse than that , you deliberately concealed that positive status from her			2
' when you did take medication you hid the medication , and the fact you were taking it , from her and you also kept your visits to the clinic from her			2
' she trusted you implicitly , it never crossed her mind that you were @entity5 positive			2
' she believed it was a safe relationship , given your account to her that previous relationships had been long standing			1
' needless to say , the revelation she was @entity5 positive had a devastating effect upon her , leading to severe and continuing emotional and physical problems in addition to the serious psychological harm you caused her			0
' having regard to the victim personal statement , clearly @entity8 ’s life has been changed forever			1
' she speaks of depression , a sense of worthlessness			0
' she speaks of her nightmares , her fragile state			0
she speaks of trust remaining a huge issue for her			0
you were advised in terms to tell all partners of your status and i am satisfied you deliberately chose not to , thereby denying x choice			1
' you chose , quite deliberately , to ignore repeated warnings and advice you were given by the clinic			0
' the court heard during the trial @entity17 had been repeatedly advised on how to avoid passing on the disease - as well as the importance of condoms - after he was diagnosed			1
he had also been warned of his legal and moral obligation to inform sexual partners of his illness			2
but @entity17 , of @entity88 , @entity2 , had sex with the woman without using protection and had not been regularly taking his medication or attending clinic appointments to try and control his illness , as he had been advised			1
@entity94 told jurors she collapsed when she tested positive for the disease ( file picture ) following the conviction in october , the victim known as @entity8 said : ' the selfish behaviour of @entity101 is nothing short of appalling			1
' through the position he now finds himself in , i hope he uses this time to reflect on the damage he has done through his treatment of others , and learn something of compassion			2
' @entity17 did not give evidence during the trial but told detectives in interview he believed it was still possible for him to have safe sex even without the use of a condom			1
@entity8 told jurors during the trial , while giving evidence from behind a screen to protect her privacy , she confronted @entity125 at his studio after was told she had the disease and suspected he had given her it			2
she told the court : ' it was rage , it is the only word i can use to describe it			2
' i am a very calm , private person really and i do n’t think i have ever felt that way before			0
' the deceit just beggars belief			1
it was an unpleasant experience feeling like that			0
i hope one day i can move on from it '			1
the woman told jurors @entity17 had told her during the confrontation he ' was n’t dealing with it ' after getting his own diagnosis			1
she added : ' i said quite a few unpleasant things in the heat of the moment			0
' i tried to slap him across the face			0
it did n’t work - he caught my wrist and told me to calm down			1
' lies : ' x ' said she would have continued her relationship with @entity17 if he had not kept the secret from her @entity8 told jurors she would have used condoms if she had known @entity125 was @entity5 positive but would not have ended their relationship for that reason alone			1
she said : ' people with @entity5 are allowed to have relationships , are allowed to lead a healthy life			2
' the irony of it is he has said he did n’t tell me because he was frightened he would lose me			0
' he lost me because he did n’t tell me			0
' it would have made no difference to how i felt about him if he had told me , i would have thought he was a very , very brave man and i would have supported him			2
' the woman told jurors she ' collapsed ' after being told she had tested positive for the disease during a health check , after her relationship with @entity17 had ended			1
she told jurors she ' regrettably ' did not use condoms while having sex with @entity17 and they were never suggested or discussed			1
she said : ' it was because i was in love with him , because i thought it was a safe relationship , i felt safe in it			0
' i think it was serious from the first time that we went out on the very first date			0
' it was , on reflection , difficult to describe because it was a very stupid thing to do			0
' i think i was just so happy he had asked me to go out with him and spend some time with him it just never crossed my mind			0
' the woman told jurors she never saw @entity17 taking medication other than @entity201 for headaches and minor ailments and believed his health to be excellent			1
prosecutor @entity206 told the court : ' the crown ’s case is he was clearly reckless in his actions in not telling her he was infected , not attending the clinic and not taking his medication ' he failed to protect x by engaging in sexual intercourse without protection			1
' it shows his cavalier approach to sex and disregard for the safety of others and complete lack of concern as to whether he could infect another person			0
' @entity17 told police very few people were aware of his @entity5 status and said he tried to kill himself twice after the confrontation with @entity233 speaking after the case , @entity8 added in a statement released by police : ' the actions of @entity101 towards myself have taken away so many choices i should have been entitled to , therefore i ask that i am allowed to continue to lead a private and dignified life as is my human right			1
' i would like to take this opportunity to urge anyone who has had a relationship with @entity101 to contact their @entity245 and request @entity5 testing			0
' early diagnosis and treatment can prevent irretrievable breakdown of good health , and ultimately saves lives			0
the care and support i received has helped me enormously in re-building my life			0
' should any persons feel it necessary to talk to the police , i want to state with complete confidence that without prejudice or judgement , the respect and kindness i have received has shown no bounds			0
' there is no shame in having an hiv test , or indeed being @entity5 positive			0
look after yourself and others , going for a test may well save your life			0
' @entity272 , defending , said @entity17 was in a state of ' denial ' after his diagnosis and had to cope with the death of both his parents within a short time of each other as well as the collapse of his business			1
mr @entity272 said : ' when the offence was committed , the information available suggests , this man was not in his right mind and that may have effected his appreciation of the level of risk he posed to other people			2
' the doctor ’s report describes his response to diagnosis as a state of denial			0
' it led to certain behaviour such that he did n’t treat himself , he pretended it had n’t happened			0
' he , according to the doctor , was living in something close to a fantasy world where it had n’t happened at all			0
' mr @entity272 said @entity17 is now a ' different man ' who is acting responsibly in relation to his illness			1
he added : ' he expresses very deep sorrow and remorse about the victim in this case			2

@entity1 , 48 , did not use protection and allowed lover to become infected
victim told previous hearing : ' the deceit just beggars belief - i hope one day i can move on from it '
former partners of @entity17 urged to get tested if they fear they are at risk
