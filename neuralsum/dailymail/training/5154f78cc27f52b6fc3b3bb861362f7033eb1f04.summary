by @entity0 the teacher who organised vile @entity6 ‘ death parties ’ and compared the @entity3 to @entity4 , bought her council house using the @entity6 's right - to - buy scheme and then doubled her money , it was revealed today			1
@entity10 , 45 , made £ 150,0000 when she sold her @entity12 home four years after buying it off the local authority in @entity15			1
@entity6 wanted to increase house ownership in the 1980s after she came to power , so she let council property residents snap them up for bargain prices from local authorities			2
and it appears that extreme @entity23 miss @entity10 used the scheme to make a huge sum of cash			2
@entity6 hater : @entity10 invited 5,000 to a party celebrating the @entity6 's death , but years earlier bought a council house ( right ) using the landmark right - to - buy scheme , selling it for double what she paid sale : documents show that @entity37 bought the house in @entity15 for £ 141,000 and then sold it four years later for £ 298,000 in june 2006 miss @entity10 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , bought the leasehold of a flat in a pretty @entity44 townhouse from @entity45 for £ 141,000			1
just four years later she sold the @entity12 property for £ 298,000			1
if she had sold it within three years she would have had to repay some cash to the council			2
speaking next to a burning effigy of the former prime minister at a demo last weekend in @entity53 , she said : ' the council houses were sold , what a wonderful thing to be able to own your own home and i have no problem with poorer people being able to buy their own home but that money went straight to central government			1
' it was n't used to build more council houses for people for affordable rents			2

' protests : miss @entity10 , who specialises in teaching troubled children , wrote : ' who wants to p * * * on her grave ? ' as she encouraged people to celebrate @entity6 's death she added : ' i think @entity6 was a despot			1
she was cold , calculating and she knew exactly what she was doing			0
surgery : @entity10 was given breast implants on the @entity82 because she complained of low self - esteem , it also emerged ' i do n't care about @entity6 , i did n't care about her dying , i do n't care about celebrating her death			1
i care about the issues and i care about being able to mark that			0
' i am not interested in celebrating someone 's death , i am interested that there is a whitewash of who she was , and that she is not made out to be some wonderful woman			0
' history does not forget ' @entity96 was unavailable for comment today			0
@entity10 called @entity6 a despot and said : ‘ they danced in the streets when @entity4 died , too ’			2
the 45 - year - old – who was given breast implants on the @entity82 because she complained of low self - esteem – had sparked outrage by creating an internet page called : ‘ the witch is dead			1
’ on it she urged more than 5,000 people to attend a death party in central @entity12 on monday			1
miss @entity10 , who specialises in teaching troubled children , wrote of @entity6 : ‘ who wants to p * * * on her grave ? ’ she later attempted to defend her behaviour by claiming she was ‘ the voice of reason ’			1
‘ i did n’t do the rioting – i just organised a @entity119 page			0
i ’m actually the voice of reason			0
i did n’t fan the flames			0
it was a way for us to come together and create unity and solidarity .			0
