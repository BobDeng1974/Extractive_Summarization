@entity0 take on @entity1 at @entity2 on sunday as the two sides go head - to - head for the @entity6 trophy			1
the @entity7 fell to a surprise 5 - 3 defeat against @entity1 on @entity10 as @entity1 striker @entity11 helped his side earn all three points at @entity14			1
@entity16 's side will be hoping to exact revenge against @entity1 after losing to their @entity19 rivals in the @entity6 final in 2008			1
here , @entity21 compares the two predicted line - ups for sunday 's clash			1
@entity0 face @entity1 in the @entity6 final on sunday at @entity2 @entity16 's side take on @entity26 's @entity1 side in the first domestic cup final of the season @entity29 and @entity11 will be hoping to fire their respective sides to @entity6 glory @entity33 8.5 @entity34 9 @entity36 shotstopper @entity33 has done well since finally donning gloves for @entity0 after a loan spell at @entity39 which saw him become @entity42 's hottest property			1
however , a few recent mistakes have seen him rotated with @entity7 stalwart @entity44			2
in @entity34 , @entity1 have the finished article			2
the @entity46 is one of the most sought - after keepers on the continent and vies with @entity49 for the title of the @entity52 's finest no 1			0
@entity0 's @entity33 and @entity1 's @entity34 are among the best keepers in the @entity52 @entity54 8 @entity55 7 to be the fiercest competitor in this @entity0 team takes some doing , but @entity54 is just that			1
his never - say - die attitude is only matched by his uncanny ability to pop up with crucial goals			0
once one of the premier talents in @entity65 football , @entity55 must work on his defending if he is to become the real deal			0
however , his attacking from full back remains a real threat and a pinpoint cross from him could decide the final			0
@entity54 is an important member of @entity16 's side while @entity55 is back to full fitness @entity74 7 @entity75 7 @entity77 centre half @entity74 has come in for flak this season , shipping quite a few goals through errors - notably against @entity1 on @entity10			1
he remains a solid presence on his day but it 's touch and go whether him or @entity84 will get the nod			0
youngster @entity75 has seen off the challenges of @entity87 and @entity88 to become @entity1 's first - choice centre half			1
the threat of @entity29 , however , will be the ultimate test			0
@entity74 's form has dipped this season while @entity75 has wormed his way into @entity1 ' first team @entity96 9 @entity97 8 @entity0 's evergreen skipper has continued his impeccable form under @entity16			1
still the best centre half in the @entity52 , if he has is hands on the trophy come sunday you suspect he 'll have more to do with it than anyone			0
@entity108 has been more inconsistent than his first season at the @entity14 , but remains @entity1 's defensive rock on his good days			2
@entity96 will be hoping to lift the cup , while @entity97 is out to win his first trophy at @entity1 @entity115 8 @entity116 7 @entity117 has drawn criticism for his defensive work despite his attacking presence and ability to grab a goal , while @entity115 is the polar opposite			2
the converted right back has been one of @entity16 's most consistent performers			0
@entity115 and @entity116 are both expected to start at left back for their respective sides @entity129 7.5 @entity130 7 @entity132 's suspension is terrible news for @entity0 , the big @entity134 being the cornerstone of @entity16 's side			1
while a vastly different player , the experience and pace of @entity129 is handy to call on			2
@entity130 is just one of a host of @entity1 youngsters to come into the side and efficiently make a first team spot his own			0
@entity129 will fill in for the suspended @entity132 , while @entity130 is expected to get the nod @entity145 8.5 @entity146 8 @entity148 fans were beside themselves when their former favourite son returned to the capital in blue , and @entity145 ' role as @entity0 's creative master have shown why , even if recent performances have waned			1
@entity146 is one of several @entity26 success stories , a hugely adept technical and physical presence in the @entity1 midfield			0
@entity0 midfielder @entity145 will go head - to - head against @entity1 's @entity146 @entity159 8 @entity160 7 @entity159 has been one of @entity0 's leading lights over the past couple of months , surely to the chagrin of new signing @entity164			1
fans often want more end product from the @entity168 , but he 's one of the first names on @entity16 's teamsheet			0
@entity160 has overcome a poor 12 months after emerging as one of @entity77 's brightest hopes , but questions still remain over his consistency and ability in big games			0
@entity159 is expected to start ahead of @entity164 , while @entity160 could pose a threat on the wing @entity179 8 @entity180 8.5 @entity180 has been one of the players of the season , his vision , creativity and eye for goal constantly digging @entity1 out of a hole with partner in crime @entity11			2
@entity168 @entity179 struggles slightly with consistency in this @entity0 side , but on his day will be man of the match			0
his all action displays in the no 10 role belie his tender years and scream ' @entity16 player '			0
@entity179 and @entity180 are two of the best playmakers in the @entity52 @entity200 9.5 @entity201 7 hazard is one of the finest players in the world and in full flow the best to watch in the @entity52 , with most of @entity0 ’s attacking play being driven by him			2
@entity201 has improved under @entity26 but still looks a far cry from what @entity1 expected for £ 30million @entity200 and @entity201 have the potential to win the match for their side by producing a piece of magic @entity29 8.5 @entity11 8.5 two of the stars of the season , local boy come good @entity11 has lit up the scoring charts and put @entity0 to the sword on @entity10			1
in @entity29 , however , the @entity7 have a behemoth , capable of terrorising defences with a frightening mix of tenacity , physicality and scoring prowess			0
@entity29 and @entity11 have scored goals for fun during the course of the season @entity0 90.5/110 @entity1 84/110			1

@entity0 face @entity1 in the @entity6 final on sunday
