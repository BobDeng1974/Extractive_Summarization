this was an afternoon that had it all			0
comebacks , shambolic defending , and - for @entity5 at least - the dawning realisation that they need to learn how to hold on to leads			0
wolves were behind , then ahead before surrendering twice			0
they are games like these that may determine whether the newboys can keep pace at the top			0
@entity14 , for all their good work going forward , were there for the taking			2
@entity18 's own goal had looked like handing the visitors all three points , but @entity22 ’s vicious strike from the edge of the box as we crept into injury time stole the show			1
@entity22 was able to save @entity14 from defeat as @entity7 twice relinquished their lead @entity22 and @entity14 celebrate their last - minute equaliser to make it 3 - 3 against @entity7 @entity22 salvaged a point for @entity14 as @entity33 returns the ball to the spot for the restart @entity37 scores @entity7 ' third goal as he thought he 'd gifted the visitors a late 3 - 2 winner @entity7 manager @entity5 looks on during the @entity41 3 - 3 draw at @entity14 @entity14 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity43 6 , @entity44 5.5 , @entity45 6.5 , @entity46 5.5 , @entity47 6 ; @entity18 6,5 , @entity48 5 ( @entity49 46 - 5 ) , @entity50 7 , @entity51 7 ( @entity52 73 ) ; @entity53 6.5 ( @entity33 68 - 6 ) , @entity22 7 subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity52 , @entity58 bookings : @entity49 , @entity51 goals : @entity45 ( 19 ) , @entity51 ( 55 ) , @entity22 ( 89 ) @entity7 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity61 6 ; @entity62 6 , @entity63 6 , @entity64 5 , @entity65 6 ; @entity66 6 , @entity67 7 ; @entity68 ( @entity69 79 ) , @entity70 7 ( @entity37 77 ) , @entity71 6.5 ; @entity72 6.5 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 bookings : @entity64 , @entity37 goals : @entity68 ( 51 ) , @entity67 ( 54 ) , @entity37 ( 84 ) referee : @entity81 a four - minute spell early in the second half to yield three goals was the obvious highlight , but this was captivating from start to finish			1
wolves were dozy in switching on to @entity47 ’s short corner with @entity91 before the latter whipped in wonderfully from the right , allowing the young central defender @entity45 to steal a yard at the near post and thump home a header			2
it was a sweet moment for the 22 - year - old , who netted a first goal for the club who brought him through its academy			1
this is his first sustained period in the first team alongside the more experienced @entity46 ; @entity45 has had to work for an opportunity after no less than an astonishing 11 loan spells away in a short career			2
the last - a season at @entity112 - clearly did him no harm			0
on - loan striker @entity22 showed just why the majority of the @entity41 would n’t mind having him in their midst after his quick thinking robbed @entity64 of possession and won the initial corner and would later flash an effort just wide after easily pushing the weak @entity66 off the ball 30 yards out			1
@entity14 's @entity45 scores his side 's first goal as @entity7 fell 1 - 0 down after just 19 minutes @entity14 's @entity45 celebrates scoring his side 's first goal against @entity7 on sunday @entity45 of @entity14 celebrates scoring the opening goal of the @entity41 clash with @entity7 @entity14 's @entity45 celebrates with @entity18 after putting his side 1 - 0 up against @entity7 @entity45 and @entity18 celebrate together after @entity14 went 1 - 0 up against @entity7 the @entity14 might have found themselves behind before that 19th minute opener , though			1
the impressive @entity130 , only 21 and formerly of @entity131 , found himself in @entity46 ’s slipstream after intelligent work from @entity72 but could only fire straight at @entity43			0
wolves , too narrow and one - paced , had struggled to really get a grip on this until the break			0
six minutes after it , @entity71 was finally afforded time to run at @entity44 on the left and drilled a cross low towards @entity142 at the back post who duly obliged			2
@entity142 of @entity7 celebrates scoring his side 's first goal against @entity14 @entity142 of @entity7 celebrates scoring the visiting side 's first goal against @entity41 club @entity14 the away end of the @entity150 - heavily populated with 1,800 visiting supporters - went berserk			1
even more so three minutes later			0
inexplicably unmarked on the penalty spot , @entity67 calmly slotted in a second after @entity47 uncharacteristically gave the ball away in his own box			2
the four - minute madness did n’t end there			1
almost immediately from the restart the hosts were level			0
@entity53 broke menacingly through the middle , playing in @entity51 and the winger slotted underneath @entity61			0
@entity18 put through his own net from a corner to spark further delirium before wily @entity22 was able to earn a share of the spoils for @entity167			1
@entity67 of @entity7 scores his side 's second goal minutes later to reverse the lead @entity67 put @entity7 ahead in the second half after @entity14 took an initial lead after just 19 minutes @entity14 's @entity51 celebrates scoring his side 's second goal to make it 2 - 2 on sunday afternoon @entity14 's @entity51 brought @entity14 level with @entity7 after the home side relinquished their early lead @entity14 brought matters level to 2 - 2 with more than half hour to play against @entity7 on sunday afternoon @entity7 players look dejected during a break in play after @entity14 equalised to make it 2 - 2 on sunday reading manager @entity183 looks on after his side relinquished their early 1 - 0 lead against @entity7			1

@entity45 gave @entity14 an initial first half 1 - 0 lead after 19 minutes
@entity142 equalised in the 51st minute to bring @entity7 level to 1 - 1
@entity67 gave @entity7 the lead shortly after but @entity14 equalised less than a minute later through @entity51 to make it 2 - 2
@entity18 own goal looked to win tie for @entity7 with 84th - minute strike
@entity22 netted in 89th minute to make it 3 - 3 and take a point *apiece*
