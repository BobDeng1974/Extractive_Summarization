by @entity0 a father and son who were filmed laughing as they encouraged their dogs to tear animals to shreds will be released from prison in just a few weeks after being given light sentences today			1
@entity9 , 63 , and his son @entity10 , 42 , both from @entity11 in @entity12 , were branded ' absolutely inhumane ' after filming themselves feeding live pigeons to ferrets , cutting off the heads of chickens with knives and setting a pack of dogs on a fox			1
but the the pair were today jailed for just 12 and 22 weeks respectively after admitting a total of seven animal cruelty offences at @entity25			1
his father @entity9 , 63 , was jailed for 12 weeks after causing unnecessary suffering to animals through the ‘ inhumane ’ slaughter of chickens			1
at an earlier hearing in february , @entity35 pleaded guilty to a number of charges , including the inhumane slaughter of chickens , causing wild rats to be attacked by dogs and taking feral pigeons to feed ferrets			1
he also pleaded guilty to causing an animal fight by placing a fox with three dogs			1
@entity9 had earlier pleaded guilty to one charge of the inappropriate slaughter of chickens			0
trapped : @entity35 is pictured holding a cage containing a wild rat he captured			1
@entity10 and his father @entity59 would later set the rat loose in a courtyard and encourage their dogs to tear it to pieces @entity66 : the captured rats were released from their cages into a rundown courtyard , where @entity35 and his father @entity59 would then set their dogs on them sick : on a video released by the @entity73 , the three dogs can be seen chasing the terrified rat before pinning it in a corner and tearing it to pieces referring to @entity35 ’s role in the acts , @entity79 , prosecuting , said : ' the charges involve the slaughter of chickens , and the causing of wild rats to be attacked by dogs			1
' there are three offences relating to the rats and there ’s also an offence relating to the feeding of wild pigeons to ferrets			1
' and an offence - perhaps the most serious - of causing the animal fight to take place between a fox and three dogs			1
the dogs were set upon the fox that was kept in a caged box , tearing it apart and killing it			2
' several of the offences - which took place between november 2011 and june 2013 - took place in front of gathered crowds and were captured on video			0
@entity35 could even be heard laughing on the footage			2
pain : the dogs eventually get hold of the rat as it tries to escape down a drain			0
they then tear it apart no escape : elsewhere in the footage , the dogs are seen being encouraged to enter a small cage in which a fox is held			2
the dogs can then be seen viciously attacking the animal @entity125 , defending , said both defendants were ‘ very ashamed ’ by their actions			0
he added @entity9 had enjoyed success at dog shows with pets in the past and that the prospect of being banned from owning animals would be a ' considerable punishment ' to him			0
but district judge @entity135 ignored pleas to give the defendants suspended sentences			0
' this was absolutely inhumane behaviour to treat animals in this way , ' he said			0
' most people would not be able to comprehend how you could treat animals with such cruelty			2
' @entity73 officer @entity147 described the case as the worst one of its kind he had ever dealt with and welcomed the sentences			0
vicious : the fox is quickly torn to pieces by the dogs , as one of the two men is heard encouraging them to increase their aggression death : the fox eventually escapes from the cage , but the dogs follow it to a grassy area , where it is torn apart ' these sort of offences are just barbaric			1
it is abhorrent cruelty that belongs in the history books , ' he said			0
' there has been a rise in this sort of behaviour across the @entity173 and if people are going to take that decision to get involved in that sort of cruelty then they can expect to spend time in prison , ' he added			0
' @entity35 is clearly obsessed with the interaction between predator and prey , even to the point that i could hear laughter in the background , ' mr @entity147 went on to say			2
the defendants were also ordered to pay £ 300 each in court costs			0
their four dogs , one of which has since given birth to six puppies , have also been seized .			0
