at first glance , it appears to be any ordinary play - date for two young girls at primary school			1
in a pink - walled bedroom , decorated with posters of @entity9 , best friends @entity5 and @entity6 settle themselves on to the bed and press play on the webcam of their computer			2
but they ’re not about to video - chat with friends or a relative abroad			2
what they ’re doing is far more pernicious — and will be horrifying to parents everywhere			2
then she settles down — seemingly without any comprehension of the genie she is unleashing from its bottle — to publicly deem each one of them as either ‘ hot ’ or ‘ not ’			2
it ’s hard to think of a more spiteful game			2
‘ if we say you are not pretty or good looking , do n’t get offended , ’ pipes up @entity6 , issuing the standard disclaimer for videos of this kind			1
‘ it ’s just our opinion ! ’ the roll - call then begins			2
‘ @entity58 ’ is the first of the 30 names on the list to be read out as if from a class register			2
‘ @entity61 ! ’ the girls immediately exclaim in unison			1
‘ hot ! ’ is the decree			2
the name of a third classmate , however , is met with a pause just long enough for the girls to exchange knowing smirks			2
sorry ! ’ they chime in high voices which belie the cruelty of what they ’re saying			2
remember , these girls , and the objects of their derision , are no more than ten or 11			2
and they ’re far from alone			2
i ’ve discovered that these kinds of scenes are being played out in children ’s bedrooms across the country			1
seven more classmates , both boys and girls , get the thumbs - down			2
as soon as the last judgment is handed down , the girls sign off with a satisfied : ‘ thanks for watching ! ’ they then upload the video to @entity89 for everyone to see			0
in just a few days , the clip gets 120 views , suggesting no one in their class — or perhaps their school — has missed it			1
but what people will miss is the sight of the stricken faces of the children so cruelly dismissed , the tears shed into pillows , and the bravery needed to go to school the next day			1
of course , cruelty among children has existed since the words ‘ no , you ca n’t play with us ’ were first uttered			1
but this is a new , more public humiliation			1
scroll through @entity89 and you ’ll find ‘ hot - or - not ’ videos by girls who look no older than nine			1
thousands more can be found on @entity118 pages			0
these all seem to be filmed in bedrooms and verdicts delivered with a brutal certainty even @entity123 would baulk at			0
there are variations — one angelic - looking little girl called @entity127 used ‘ @entity128 ’ or ‘ @entity129 ’			0
she ’s had 2,000 views so far			1
as a parenting expert who ’s written five books on raising children , i know the effect this could have on those deemed ‘ not hot ’			1
and coming at such a critical time in their lives , when youngsters are looking to their peers to help them work out who they are , those effects can be life - long			0
the fact ‘ hot - or - not ’ videos are so public increases a young person ’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look			1
my worry is that youngsters internalise these labels and start bullying themselves , telling themselves they are ugly and they can do nothing about it			0
feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success : study after study has found that the grades of such children go down			1
the fact ‘ hot - or - not ’ videos are so public increases a young person ’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look			1
feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success : study after study has found that the grades of such children go down ( picture posed by models ) and if they feel they do not belong , they often start to avoid school			1
meanwhile , those who feel ugly or not good enough rarely join in class discussions , for fear of drawing attention to their appearance			0
indeed , more than six out of ten children who have been bullied said it had a detrimental effect on their education , according to a survey by charity @entity192			1
even worse , almost one in three bullied children goes on to self - harm , with 10 per cent attempting to kill themselves			1
who knows what nightmares this new type of bullying will cause ? living up to these ideals of beauty is one of many pressures bearing down on 15 - year - old @entity203 as she prepares to take her gsces this summer			0
@entity203 , who lives near @entity205 , @entity206 , has been on the receiving end of some of the judgments passed down in the 50 or so videos made by fellow pupils at her school , an oversubscribed academy rated ‘ good with outstanding features ’ by @entity215			1
although she has been mainly rated ‘ hot ’ , she has also been dismissed as ‘ not ’ in some clips			1
when she describes her experiences , it offers a glimpse into a brutal world in which youngsters ’ popularity is dictated by looks and the ‘ in ’ girls seek to maintain their classroom pecking order by passing down decrees on others			0
as girls grow up , the prettiest rise to the top of the popularity poll , and it is this group , says @entity203 , who are more likely to feel entitled to declare from up high who also makes the grade			0
she says : ‘ if you are judged to be “ not ” , you do n’t say anything as you do n’t want the others to think you are upset			0
but it ’s humiliating because it ’s so public			1
some people will try to change the way they look because of it			0
there are loads of these videos			1
there are so many of them on people ’s @entity118 pages as well as @entity89 — and there ’s nothing adults can do			0
’ ‘ hot or not ’ started off as an @entity253 phenomenon , where young women would put a picture of themselves online and be rated by other users			1
in the @entity258 , it morphed into the version we have today			0
some youngsters justify these videos by saying classmates can put themselves forward to be rated by ‘ liking ’ a status announcement saying someone at their school is planning to film one			1
sadly , it ’s often the most insecure youngsters , aching to be accepted by the pretty girls who make these videos , who volunteer			1
they ’re seeking validation they wo n’t get			0
so why is such ruthlessness starting ever younger ? one reason is puberty is kicking in earlier , with as many as one in seven girls showing signs of breast development ( with the associated surges in hormones ) aged just eight			0
girls can also be allowed by their parents to grow up too soon , so they act like teenagers without the maturity to understand the consequences of their actions			0
in a world where girls grow up feeling like they are in a constant beauty contest — half of three to six - year - olds say they worry about being fat , and a fifth of those under 11 have already been on a diet — these ‘ hot - or - not ’ videos should hardly surprise us			1
and middle - class girls are most likely to post these videos , as their families more often own @entity305 and computers			1
middle - class values also make them more likely to want to look a certain way and avoid conflict , says @entity310 , author of best - selling book @entity311			0
that also means any anger and aggression comes out in indirect ways — such as those brutal video judgments			0
what is so shocking is their total disregard for others ’ feelings			0
but in an age where children spend longer in front of a screen than with friends , one result is that they ’re not learning social skills or empathy			1
indeed , they may be genuinely unaware of the impact			0
throw into the mix that they see adults being just as judgmental on some of our most popular tv shows — the @entity337 , @entity258 ’s @entity338 , @entity339 — and it ’s easy to see where they get the idea that being nasty wins friends			0
‘ you are showing children that it ’s entertaining to you — that normalises it , ’ says @entity344 , author of self - help book @entity346			1
but there may be a glimmer of hope			0
in a clip in another bedroom , @entity357 , yet another girl in her early teens , signs off her @entity89 video — which was viewed 13,000 times — saying : ‘ if it offends anyone , i am not sorry			0
i do n’t care because i am just telling the truth			0
’ the comments posted by viewers make clear that some of her peers see life very differently			0
‘ everyone is beautiful in their own way			0
what is the point of doing these videos ? ’ asks one			1
‘ i can only hope that one day , you ’ll understand what a terrible thing this is to do , ’ adds another			0
let ’s hope parents can help that message spread before too many young lives are damaged			2
some names have been changed			0
