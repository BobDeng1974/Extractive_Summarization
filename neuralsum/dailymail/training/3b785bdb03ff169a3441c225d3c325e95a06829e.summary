by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 04:41 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 9 july 2013 @entity3 first lady @entity2 was today forced to pay legal costs to a writer who accused her of being the ‘ shared ’ mistress of two married politicians			1
it follows ms @entity2 withdrawing her claim of defamation against @entity12 , who exposed the 48 - year - old ’s extraordinarily colourful love life			1
mr @entity12 and fellow tv journalist @entity15 wrote a book called ‘ @entity17 ’ ( @entity16 ) which ms @entity2 originally wanted pulped			1
@entity3 president @entity18 and his partner @entity2			2
the accusations over her fidelity were made in a biography of the @entity23 called the @entity24 it reveals how she was regularly sleeping with 58 - year - old @entity18 , the future @entity28 president , at the same time as former conservative minister @entity29 , now 68			2
ms @entity2 , who works for the glossy celebrity magazine @entity30 , was still married to fellow journalist @entity31 while the affairs were taking place in the early 2000s			2
both men were aware they were ‘ sharing ’ ms @entity2 , but when mr @entity29 refused to leave his wife , she stuck with mr @entity18 , says the book			1
mr @entity18 was still with @entity37 , the mother of his four children , at the time of the four year - long affair , the book alleges			2
ms @entity2 has never directly denied the accusations , and has now abandoned her libel claim for £ 90,000			0
this is despite the first lady winning a privacy case against the writers , using notoriously strict @entity3 legislation designed to protect the personal lives of public figures from public scrutiny			1
ms @entity2 was said to be sleeping with mr @entity18 at the same time as @entity29 ( pictured right ) following the withdrawal of the defamation case , ms @entity2 has to pay the equivalent of £ 2,150 to mr @entity12 to cover legal expenses , and the same amount to his publishers			1
ms @entity2 ’s humiliation was blamed by her barrister , @entity59 , ‘ purely on procedure			0
’ he pointed to the fact that she was awarded the equivalent of more than £ 10,000 by the @entity64 in @entity1 following her successful privacy case earlier this year			1
but the journalists both insist that their account of ms @entity2 ’s past was the result of an ‘ honest investigation ’ meant to illustrate ‘ the overbearing closeness between politicians and political journalists ’			0
despite being a journalist for a magazine which regularly features intimate details of people ’s private lives , ms @entity2 has become notoriously litigious since moving into the @entity79 last year			0
she successfully sued @entity30 rivals @entity80 and @entity82 for publishing swimsuit pictures of her and mr @entity18 on a private beach			0
ms @entity2 has not commented on her latest court reversal , which was announced in an official court order late on monday			0
she is herself facing a legal action over claims that the taxpayer should not be supporting her lifestyle as the ‘ president ’s mistress ’			0
@entity93 , a supermarket chain heir , launched the complaint earlier this year , saying : ‘ it is scandalous that our taxes are being used to house , feed , upkeep and pay for the staff and travel of a lady to whom we have no legal obligation			0

claims of the affair were made in a book called ' @entity16 '
@entity2 had already won a privacy case against the writers
