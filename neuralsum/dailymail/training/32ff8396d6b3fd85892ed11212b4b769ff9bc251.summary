a @entity1 student travelled more than 5,000 miles to @entity2 , @entity3 , to meet a stranger who @entity5 suggested he make friends with			1
@entity7 , 24 , was curious when @entity8 , 49 , popped up as a ' suggested friend ' on his @entity5 feed because they had no obvious connection aside from one mutual acquaintance			1
but after browsing through mr @entity8 's pictures , mr @entity7 , from @entity15 in @entity1 , became intrigued by the artist 's eclectic interests			1
have you seen this man ? the poster which @entity1 student @entity21 , 24 , placed all over @entity2 , @entity3 in an attempt to find @entity8 , a stranger whom @entity5 suggested he should befriend			1
' @entity5 suggested we become friends , and i thought that was pretty absurd , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' i became fascinated by him			0
he had a long beard and looked a little unusual			0
he did art performances and paintings of mythical creatures and strange beasts which only made me more interested in him			0
' he looked like someone i wanted to meet - a very eccentric person			0
' so when mr @entity8 , of @entity3 , failed to respond to him on @entity5 , mr @entity7 decided to make the 5,000 - mile trip to ask him in person if they could be friends			1
' these days you can be friends with anyone anywhere just by clicking that friend request button			0
i wanted to take it back to the real world , ' mr @entity8 said			1
search : mr @entity7 during the search for mr @entity8 , filming one of their posters pinned up around @entity2 best of @entity5 friends : mr @entity7 , mr @entity48 and mr @entity8 , who they finally met at a book signing mr @entity7 set off with his friend , @entity51 , 27 , who took a video camera to document the adventure			1
they spent a week searching for mr @entity8 , scouring the city of @entity2 by putting posters up on every street and asking passers - by if they knew him			1
they even wore t - shirts carrying the slogan ' @entity8 for president ! ' in the hope they would help them find him			2
mr @entity7 , said : ' at first we thought our chances of finding him were very slim , but then we visited some places in @entity2 that we knew he liked to go - and we eventually found someone who knew him			0
' that contact suggested looking for mr @entity8 at a book signing			2
there mr @entity7 finally came face - to - face with the stranger to whom @entity5 was so keen to introduce him			0
' we were nervous when we first saw him , ' said mr @entity7 ' we did n't know how he would react - but after we explained the whole thing he just laughed and said " well , you found me " as if he was expecting us			0
' eccentric : one of mr @entity8 's @entity5 pictures , standing next to a tree with a cartoon face , which persuaded mr @entity7 that @entity5 's algorithms were right and they should indeed become friends fun times : in the end mr @entity7 and mr @entity48 spent three weeks in @entity2 getting to know mr @entity8 @entity5 's algorithms were vindicated as mr @entity7 and mr @entity48 spent three enjoyable weeks with mr @entity8			1
mr @entity7 said : ' we had a lot of fun with @entity8 , and i consider him a real friend			2
we 're still in touch through @entity5 , and he might be coming to visit us next summer			0
mr @entity7 and mr @entity48 's short documentary can watched on @entity93 .			0

@entity21 was intrigued at the suggestion he befriend @entity96
after looking at the artist 's pictures decided add him as a @entity5 friend
but after mr @entity8 failed to respond the student travelled to find him
he and a friend *tracked* down mr @entity96 and spent three weeks with him
