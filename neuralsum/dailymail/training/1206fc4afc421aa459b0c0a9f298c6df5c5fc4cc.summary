@entity7 student @entity6 has been playing @entity8 , morphing together images of different , ordinary animals to create with some hilarious hybrid creatures			1
from the wacky ' guinea lion ' through to the ' platyporse ' and ' pengwhale ' , these playful creations have gained a cult following online			1
neigh way ! @entity7 student has gained a cult following online for his pictures of weird and wacky creatures made from photos of two ordinary animals morphed together such as this ' shorse ' the 24 - year - old said : ‘ i try to think of unique - looking animals so that the hybrid will be memorable			1
‘ take for example beluga whales , pugs and proboscis monkeys			0
they look nothing like any other animal so i thought that they 'd make for fun subjects for animal hybrids			0
better than study : the 24 - year - old student started experimenting with the pictures as a distraction from study during exam time , creating hybrid creatures such as this ' purilla ' pug attack : this pug dog looks oddly at home with a shark 's body in this strange hybrid combination cute and cuddly ? @entity6 first started the craze with this image after feeling inspired by a picture of his friend 's guinea pigs a galloping ' snorse ' : @entity6 's pictures became popular among his friends and family and now are found all over the internet ‘ i 've also gone the other way by choosing horse as a base and trying lots of different animal heads on horses to see what it would look			1

‘ so , when i wanted breaks from reading to the exams , i began to @entity5 guinea pig heads onto other animals , to make them look even weirder			0
‘ i think the @entity101 is the first animal hybrid i made			0
’ since then , the student has gone from strength to strength and his photoshop skills are the envy of all his friends and family			0

' people think the pictures are funny , and for that i 'm grateful			0
‘ my six - year - old nephew begs me to teach him how to make them , but he 's got to wait a few years first			0
