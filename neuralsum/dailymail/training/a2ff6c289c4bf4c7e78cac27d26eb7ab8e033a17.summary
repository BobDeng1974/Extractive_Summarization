a series of online ads released this week by a @entity3 organization for college students are being called ' sexist ' by some women for the way they believe the commercials talk down to young , female voters			1
the minute - long ads , created by the @entity14 , spoof the @entity11 show @entity9 and feature a recent college grad shopping for a wedding dress with her mother and friends			1
for anyone who 's ever seen the popular reality tv program on which the ads are based , the @entity20 to the candidate videos are a spot - on parody of the drama that typically plays out in each episode of the show			2
each dress is named after a candidate in november 's elections			1
the prettier dress , shown above , is always a @entity3 candidate a mother and daughter bicker over which dress is the ' one ' as the bride 's mother insists ' i know best , ' the bride - to - be 's tag alongs take the side of their friend , and in the end , the woman walking down the aisle settles on the dress she wanted all along			1
the wedding dresses in the ads serve as metaphors for various political candidates in november 's elections , and locally targeted versions of the campaign spots are running online in 16 states			1
the more attractive wedding dress in the ad is favored by an undecided voter and young bride identified as @entity70			1
the uglier , more expensive dress , which comes with ' additional costs , including ' $ 2 billion in taxes , $ 3.6 billion in debt and 15 percent tuition increases ' is her mom 's first choice			1
notably , the simple dress in the spoofs represents @entity3 candidates , and the frumpy dress always shares a name with a @entity85 candidate			1
while conservatives and @entity3 are lauding the ads as quirky and refreshing , the @entity14 has taken flak for the million - dollar ad campaign from women who perceive the commercials as demeaning to female voters			1
@entity94 's @entity93 called the campaign the ' @entity96 ' and blasted the @entity14 for belittling women			2
' because women do n’t like dirty old politics , women like wedding dresses ! ' she sarcastically wrote			2
@entity93 also took issue with the way the ad boils down financial issues to ' an ugly veil , ugly sash , and ugly necklace			0
because veils are easier to understand than debt , obviously , ' she opined			0
a writer for the @entity112 , a left - leaning publication , also labeled the ads as ' offensive ' in a piece and ' condescending ' in her headline			0
@entity119 's @entity118 trashed them as a ' half - a * * ed attempt at brainwashing ' and claimed that the videos make ' no sense			0
none , zero , zilch			0
' the @entity85 governor 's @entity126 piled on , saying in a statement that the ads are ' further evidence ' that @entity3 ' still have no idea how to communicate with women voters			1
' ' that ’s because it ’s not just their attitudes that are condescending and insulting , but because their policies – from deep cuts to education to opposition to equal pay for equal work , to mandatory ultrasounds and defunding @entity146 – are deeply out - of - touch with the concerns of women and families , ' spokeswoman @entity133 said			0
the frumpy dress , featured here , is always a @entity153 running in that state 's election the mother and daughter bicker over which dress is the ' one ' as the bride 's mother insists ' i know best ' and tries to push the bride - to - be to pick the dress named after a @entity153 @entity165 chair , @entity164 , the first woman to be elected to the organization 's top spot , defended the campaign in the @entity170 as an attempt by her majority - female staff to speak to young women in a ' culturally relevant way			1
' @entity164 was backed up by a spokeswoman for @entity176 , another conservative organization for college students , on @entity178			0
way to reach young females in a creative way , ' @entity176 's @entity180 tweeted			2
@entity14 chairman @entity183 also thew his support behind @entity164 and the @entity14			0
' i think it 's a pretty clever ad , ' he said , according to the @entity188 's @entity187			0
making fun of the attention being heaped on the controversial set of ads , @entity193 , a columnist for @entity194 , a website that focuses on news related to @entity197 , joked that she was bothered by the way her state 's male governor , @entity200 , a @entity3 , was objectified in the @entity197 - based version of the ad and treated with ' disrespect			2
' ' yes , she 's actually comparing the governor of @entity197 to a shiny piece of fabric			0
i was flabbergasted , ' @entity193 stated			0
' how can they get away with such patronizing tripe ? ' @entity211 went on to say @entity200 ' is more than just a pretty face ' and points out that he earned three degrees in six years from the @entity214 .			0

the wedding dresses serve as metaphors for various political candidates in november 's elections
the more attractive wedding dress is favored by the young bride , and the uglier , more expensive dress , is mom 's first choice
