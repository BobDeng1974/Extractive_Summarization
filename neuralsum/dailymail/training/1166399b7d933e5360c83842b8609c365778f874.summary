' the photographic journey was a way of getting away from the computer and into @entity3 parks , ' @entity2 told @entity14			2
' a photo is the finished product but there 's everything else between - this was a way to spend a lot of time reconnecting with nature			0

' projecting onto a tree was an accident , ' he said			0
' it was one of the different surfaces i was trying and i ended up liking it because the trees , the shape you get when you project portraits , fill up the tree			0
' but the stunning photographic transformations all started in the same way , with some of @entity2 's idols agreeing to be photographed in black and white images taken in a studio			2
among the famous faces embedded in the natural forms during dusk and night include are media personality dr @entity75 , tv presenter @entity44 , @entity78 radio presenter @entity77 as well as a mix of fashion designers , tattooists , skateboarders and musicians			1

@entity2 used a long exposure technique to capture the projections			2
' depending on what you project on , it picks up the colour and texture of the surface , ' he said			0
trees were @entity2 's preferred object to project onto and created more natural and organic forms compared to rocks			2
' i wanted the people to look like them , ' he said			0
' it 's quite an abstract portrait so it helps to have recognisable faces so people can spot people they know and go " wow i 've seen that person before , they look different "			0
' ' you see familiar faces in a different context and for subjects who are often photographed , it shows them differently from normal			0
' designer @entity137 said he was happy to be involved in the series and was pleased with the finished result after seeing his profile projected onto bush in @entity47 circus performer @entity142 , pictured left , blends into a large pine tree on a bright night in @entity144 in @entity3 's east , pictured left , while journalist @entity146 becomes part of a tree in @entity97 @entity78 radio presenter @entity150 's portrait is illuminated by trees in @entity144 many of the locations @entity2 chose to project the portraits are also recognisable , including spots in @entity156 in @entity3 and coastal rocks between @entity47 and @entity48 in @entity3 's eastern suburbs , close to where the artist 's home			1
