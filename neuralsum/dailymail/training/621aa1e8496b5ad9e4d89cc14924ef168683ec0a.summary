by @entity0 for @entity1 meet devout @entity3 @entity2 - the proud owner of the world 's largest turban			1
the holy man says his extra large headgear weighs a hefty 100lb and measures a staggering 645m ( 2,115 feet ) when unwrapped - the same length as 13 @entity10 - sized swimming pools			2
the 60 - year - old has been regularly adding to it for the past 16 years and it now takes him up to six hours to get it on			1
i 'm most happy when i wear it			0
' i just keep putting on the cloth from top to bottom one layer at a time just like you would lay the storeys of a building			0
' on the rare times i do n't have my turban on i keep getting this feeling of being incomplete , that some part of me is missing			0
i get afraid that i may fall and i keep wondering " have i lost something , where is my turban ? " ' tight squeeze : mr @entity2 can only just fit through normal doorways he added : ' until the time i have no more have strength in my limbs i will carry this turban on my head			1
' most other @entity3 wear turbans that measure between five and seven metres , but mr @entity2 , from @entity47 , in the @entity48 , has decided to take it to a whole new level			1
the length of the cloth is yet to be officially verified but if proved correct it would overtake current @entity54 holder , @entity55 , whose turban measured 400m			2
to break the record , mr @entity2 says he took the length up in stages from 150m to 250m , 365m and finally a shocking 645m			1
he says the purple and orange cloth alone weighs 66lb but with the addition of decorative ornaments tips the scales at a whopping 100lb			0
wide load : the size of mr @entity2 's turban is even more apparent when he 's alongside other sikhs in full attire , mr @entity2 also carries a sword and heavy bangles , which weigh an additional 87lb			1
the height and width of his bulbous headgear makes entering doorways extremely difficult and getting into a car is impossible			0
so mr @entity2 rides a motorcycle on his regular pilgrimages across the @entity48			1
not surprisingly he has become something of a celebrity - but the attention is not always welcome			0
accessories : mr @entity2 wears bangles and decorative ornaments that push the weight of his clothing to 100lbs intrigue : mr @entity2 interacts with local school children while sporting his huge traditional @entity94 turban in the @entity96 town of @entity47 it 's a wrap : most other @entity3 wear turbans that measure between five and seven metres ' when i go out a huge crowd gathers around me			1
some are amazed beyond belief and tell me " you are great for carrying such a large turban			0
you must have been blessed with lots of energy " , ' said mr @entity2 , who belongs to the prestigious warrior order of @entity3 , known as @entity106			1
' but sometimes all they want is to take a picture , so i loudly tell them to stop			0
after all it takes me hours to put on my turban and all they want is to take a quick picture and then run away			0
' however , his efforts are impressing many in the @entity3 community			2
@entity121 , who affectionately refers to mr @entity2 as @entity122 - which means grandfather - says the giant turban has helped reawaken love for their religion among younger people			1
he said : ' these days many @entity3 children choose to cut their hair and have forgotten to wear turbans			2
but @entity122 remind us of its importance , which is very good			0
' the @entity3 community can learn a lot from him and our children can learn that they should grow their hair and wear a turban			2
