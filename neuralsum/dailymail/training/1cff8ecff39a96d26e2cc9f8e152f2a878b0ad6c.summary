by @entity0 bungling pub bosses have irritated locals and history buffs by replacing a pub sign for the @entity5 with a picture of the wrong duke			1
the 18th century pub in @entity9 , @entity10 , was named in honour of @entity12 , the @entity5 and @entity13 - the younger brother of @entity14 - after he died in 1767			1
and until a fortnight ago , the pub proudly showed off a picture of the correct duke on its pub sign hanging outside the historic alehouse			0
how it should look : the old sign on the @entity23 pub shows a picture of @entity12 who died in 1767 wrong sign : it included a picture of @entity12 who died in 1827 , instead of the @entity5 who died in 1767 , right but after a refurbishment , the sign was replaced with an image of @entity34 , @entity5 - the second son of @entity14 , who died in 1827 marching his troops up a hill – becoming the subject of a nursery rhyme			1
the pub first opened in around 1770 in memory of @entity12 , the @entity5 and @entity13 , after he died in 1767			1
local @entity42 , 41 , a history graduate , said : ‘ the @entity5 is a great pub , but why do they keep screwing around with the name ? ‘ this has got to be the most embarrassing of the lot , getting the wrong @entity5 and sticking up a daft pub sign showing the @entity47 leading his men up a hill			1
outrage : locals are n't happy with the sign which includes an image of the wrong @entity5 ‘ why bother having a pub with so much history if you go and get the very basic historical facts about the pub wrong ? ‘ you might as well build a new pub and called it the prince william , duke of cambridge			2
’ @entity61 , an ex-regular , said : ‘ i think it 's pretty lazy of @entity63 's to have just overturned the pub 's history - it 's another bit of tradition lost in the town			0
‘ the @entity5 - the correct one - was a colourful character , a ladies ' man , and i understand a bit of a lad			2
’ former landlord @entity75 said : ‘ the history behind the original name goes back to the 18th century during the reign of @entity14 who opened a tavern on the @entity81 in remembrance of his brother @entity12 , the @entity5 who had died in @entity74			1
' bit of fun ' : @entity63 's , which bought the pub , said there was no real reason behind the sign change ‘ it was said that the brothers would frequent establishments on the @entity81 during their holiday visits and this was one of their favourite venues and therefore the @entity98 's choice in opening a respectable tavern in his brother 's name			0
’ a spokesman for @entity63 's , which bought the pub 18 months ago , said : ‘ there is no real reason behind it other than a nice recognisable bit of fun			0
‘ we have been very mindful of maintaining the traditions and history of the pub. ‘ we aimed to transform the pub in a style that was empathic to the local area ( and ) every change has been approved by local conservation officers			0
‘ the name of the pub has not changed - it will remain the @entity5			2
’ it ’s not the first time the pub has been in the spotlight for the wrong reasons			0
locals kicked up a stink in 1998 when bosses at the @entity130 brewery changed its name to @entity132 's - claiming that @entity132 once visited the town			0
pub chiefs tore out glass windows with the @entity5 written on them , but were ordered to put them back by the council as the building is @entity138 - listed .			2

18th century @entity9 pub was named in honour of @entity12
after a *makeover* , new sign shows @entity34 - who died in 1827
latter @entity5 was topic of *mocking* nursery rhyme
