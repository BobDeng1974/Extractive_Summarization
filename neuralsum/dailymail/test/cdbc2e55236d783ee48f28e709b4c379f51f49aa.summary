a 4,000 - year - old tree thought to be @entity2 's oldest living organism may be dying according to its custodian			1
the stunning @entity8 , in the churchyard of the parish 's @entity5 , in @entity7 , has a girth of 38ft and an enormous vast canopy			2
its central trunk is hollow with six smaller ones branching off - possible due to disease - and locals fear it is on its way out due to wilting branches and falling leaves			1
the 4,000 - year - old tree is ' looking extremely sick , ' according to a warden at the church in @entity21 , @entity7 churchwarden @entity22 said : ' the tree is supposed to be the oldest living thing in @entity25 and was already fairly mature when @entity26 was being built			1
' experts say it is 3,500 to 4,000 years old			0
' but it 's looking extremely sick at the moment and i 'm worried whether the rural church or the yew will die first			1
' but tree expert dr @entity34 said the yew , in the village 10 miles west of @entity37 , could just be going through a bad patch			1
he said : ' they go through spells where they might look as though they are not thriving , but a few years later they might look fine			0
' the @entity8 is the subject of myth and legend and people believe the mound it grows on is @entity51 and that a @entity53 chief is buried there			2
the world 's oldest tree lives on a mountain in central @entity57 – and it is still growing			2
the 9,500 - year - old @entity58 ( pictured right ) was discovered by scientists at @entity60 during a 2004 tree census in @entity62 in @entity57			0
the age of the tree was established using carbon - 14 dating at a laboratory in @entity67 , @entity68 after an investigation by the university			0
it has been able to survive so long thanks to the process of vegetative propagation , which means it is able to effectively clone itself			0
while the visible portion of the 13ft tall tree is relatively new , its root system has been growing for almost ten thousand years .			0

experts say the @entity8 was mature when @entity26 was built
locals fear it 's ' extremely sick ' due to wilting branches and falling leaves
but a tree *surgeon* thinks it could just be going through a ' bad patch '
