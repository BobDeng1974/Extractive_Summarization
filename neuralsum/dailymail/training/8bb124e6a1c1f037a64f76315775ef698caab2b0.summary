@entity5 , 58 , fell foul of a council - run spy car when he stopped in an empty taxi rank to let 82 - year - old @entity10 out			1
he later received a letter from @entity13 council , giving him 28 days to pay the fine – which works out as £ 10 for every second of his good deed			1
stopped : mr @entity5 's car is pictured pulling over on @entity13 high street at 14.22.28 driving off : in this next picture , the driver is about to pull away in his car at 14.22.35 close - up : the images were taken by a council ' spy car ' parked a few metres away the council - run car recorded the moment mr @entity5 stopped his @entity29 at the side of the road that afternoon at 14.22 and 28 seconds			1
it then took a second snap of mrs @entity10 getting out of the car at 14.22 and 33 seconds before grabbing a third photo as her son - in - law was driving away at 14.22 and 35 seconds			1
the retired firefighter received a four - page letter from @entity39 saying he was guilty of ‘ parking contravention ’ and was given 28 days to pay the fine			1
the council refused his appeal , warning that parking for just a few seconds could have prevented a cab driver from picking up a fare			1
if he had parked just yards further up the road in a loading bay , he would have avoided the penalty notice			0
pay up : mr @entity5 received a letter from @entity39 saying he was guilty of a ' parking contravention ' today mr @entity5 joined other drivers who also fell foul of the spy car by complaining to @entity39 claiming motorists were being targeted as ' cash cows '			1
mr @entity5 , who is a blue badge holder and registered disabled due to a spinal injury he suffered when in the fire service , said he had never been given a parking ticket before			1
he said : ' people talk about the death of the @entity64 high street and it ’s hardly surprising when the people in authority allow this sort of thing to happen			1
penalty charge : the driver thought this letter he received from @entity13 council ' was a joke ' ' it just puts you off going into town for fear of being spied on by these council snoopers			1
' when the fine came through the post my first reaction was just to be very angry			2
i have never been in trouble in my life and never even had a parking ticket			2
' i thought it was a joke			2
i could have just pulled over on the road but i thought i did the right thing by getting off the road and not causing an obstruction to other traffic			2
' the taxi rank was empty anyway it was two in the afternoon , not in the rush hour or peak time and there was not a soul waiting for a cab			1
' i did n’t even turn my engine off			0
how can you get a parking fine when you have n’t even parked up ? it has all been a big shock			0
it took me a while to realise what the offence was and when i did i burst out laughing			0
' the council must be very hard - up if they ’re charging people for seven seconds			1
it is just ridiculous - whoever has seen this and then sent it out ought to be demoted			0
' our town centre is dead now , full of charity shops and empty buildings and it ’s no wonder			0
shoppers do n’t want to come here any more because of these jobsworths			0

one driver complained after pulling up for 12 seconds to drop off his wife and daughter in the same area			2
@entity134 , who runs @entity135 in @entity123 , said : ' lots and lots of drivers , more than 100 , have been caught			0
' i got a ticket when i popped into the shop with a small delivery a couple of weeks ago			0
i ca n’t believe that they are trying to catch people out like this			0
' when i got my fine i had been stopped for less than 20 seconds			2
i think it is affecting business			0
when people are so worried about parking then it puts them off coming into town			0
' ' @entity153 ' : the vehicles , which are fitted with @entity156 cameras , have been called council ' cash cows ' by critics the council said parking and stopping , for any time , in taxi ranks contravenes the @entity163			1
a @entity39 spokesman said : ' the taxi rank is reserved for the use of @entity168 drivers only and no other vehicles are permitted to stop there			1
' we acknowledge this driver may feel that the fine is unfair because he was there for only a short period of time			0
however , the taxi rank is clearly signed and stopping in the rank , even for a few seconds , could prevent a taxi from parking and picking up a fare			1
' today , figures released by car insurance company @entity181 showed that motorists are being stung by almost 900,000 parking fines a month at a cost of £ 30million			1
this is an increase of 4 per cent on the previous year			0

in may , a @entity205 council was accused of ordering the ' spy ' cars to hit minimum targets for issuing penalty notices - despite the practice being illegal			2
the alleged policy , carried out on behalf of @entity212 in north @entity205 , was revealed in a series of leaked emails and showed that the cars were told to issue at least 260 fines a day			0
