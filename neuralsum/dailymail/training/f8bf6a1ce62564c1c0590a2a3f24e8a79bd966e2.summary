the @entity6 said yesterday that @entity7 and his wife @entity8 would not face charges over the funding of residential care for his mother - in - law			1

@entity7 , mp for @entity20 , with his wife @entity8 said their ' nightmare ' had come to an end after being told they will not face criminal charges mr @entity7 , 61 , also claimed that the strain of the events contributed to his wife being diagnosed with breast cancer last week , arguing that the couple ’s ordeal had condemned her to anxiety and sleepless nights			1

the police passed a file to the @entity6 in november but they only decided to drop the case yesterday			1
mr @entity7 , mp for @entity20 in @entity50 , told the @entity51 : ‘ this nightmare has lasted more than a year from the time when the police raided our house			1
it is just absurd that justice takes this long			0
‘ the trauma my family has been through is unbelievable			0
our reputations were under a cloud for a year – and i am an mp			1
the shocking thing is that any innocent person in @entity65 can have this happen to them at any time			0
’ he added : ‘ my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer last week			0
we would argue this ordeal contributed to it			0
if this had all been dealt with in a few months she would not have gone through all the sleepless nights and worry			0
’ mrs @entity46 is locked in a dispute over care home fees with @entity78 which is still the subject of a civil case			2

but @entity90 , deputy head of the @entity6 special crime division , said : ‘ having carefully considered all of the available evidence , we have decided there is insufficient evidence to charge any criminal offence			1
’ exonerating the @entity85 , he said : ‘ the evidence showed : firstly that the woman ’s mother considered the suspects ’ conduct to be acceptable ; secondly that the suspects acted openly in declaring the sale of the mother ’s house to the council ; thirdly that no element of dishonesty could be proved			1
therefore we have advised the police to take no further action			2
’ mr @entity7 said : ‘ there were unfounded allegations made by the county council which took the police an extremely long time to investigate when they were without any foundation , which the @entity6 has made clear in its remarks			1
‘ we were interviewed only once by the police			2
we were never charged with any offence whatsoever and yet this has been hanging over us for an entire year			2
’ mr and @entity46 have already filed official complaints with the police and the local council over their conduct			0
the mp said : ‘ we were lied to throughout the process by the police about what was going on			2
people ought to be entitled to know what is happening and they ought to be entitled to swift justice			0
’ he said he will now raise the difficulty some people have in getting speedy justice with the government ’s top law officer , @entity134			0
‘ this is something i will talk to the attorney general and the home secretary about , ’ mr @entity7 said			2

’ he added : ‘ we are naturally delighted that this nightmare has now come to an end			0
