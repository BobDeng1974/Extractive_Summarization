@entity0 says he will always class himself as a midfielder despite being called upon to shore up @entity4 ’s defence			1
the 33 - year - old is highly regarded by manager @entity6 and has been trusted to play as an auxiliary centre - back and has cut an accomplished figure			2
‘ i class myself as a midfielder and probably always will , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i might have spells at centre - back , as i have over the last few years , but i ’ve played for that long in midfield that i ca n’t class myself as anything other than a midfielder			2
’ @entity0 ( left ) has impressed playing out of position in defence for @entity4 recently @entity0 ( right ) blocks a shot from @entity21 and @entity23 striker @entity22 in @entity4 's 2 - 1 win @entity0 has helped @entity4 manager @entity6 lead his team to six consecutive wins however , as @entity28 and @entity29 are both still injured , @entity0 may continue in defence for saturday ’s visit to @entity32			1
‘ you have to adapt because that ’s just how things have gone in recent weeks , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ maybe when the injuries settle down and we have more of a settled squad then it will be more consistent in terms of positioning			2
but you have to be ready to deal with injuries			2
it ’s happened a few times this season and , the more it does , the easier it gets			2
’ @entity0 missed the first three months of the season after undergoing ankle surgery in july but since his comeback , @entity4 have lost once to @entity49 and won six successive games			1
talking to @entity51 and @entity52 , @entity0 said : ‘ i feel good and i feel fresh			1
obviously i missed a lot of football at the start of the season , but i ’m enjoying it			2
‘ when you ’re out for so long you really miss it , so i am just happy to be back playing and looking forward to the games ahead			0
you just try to play your own game			0
@entity0 may continue in defence at @entity32 as @entity29 ( left ) and @entity63 ( right ) are injured @entity0 ( right ) congratulates @entity4 captain @entity64 after beating @entity65 3 - 0 at @entity66 @entity0 also praised the impact that @entity68 ( centre ) has had playing at full back for @entity4 ‘ when you ’re out for so long , you do think about how your return will go and it ’s hard to judge where you ’re at in terms of fitness and match sharpness , but things have gone alright			1
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , has praised another versatile performer @entity68 for his performances at full back			1
‘ @entity80 is a pure athlete , ’ said @entity0			1
it is the work he does that does n’t get noticed , things like carrying the ball up the pitch for 30 or 40 yards when you have been defending			0
‘ he takes you up the pitch and defenders just back up because they know about his pace			0
if he can go down the line , then he is pretty hard to catch			0
he is a great team player and , when you are playing with him , you certainly appreciate that he is on your team			0
‘ he is pretty much the full package , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ he is reserved but determined at the same time			0
he is quiet , he is pleasant and he is polite			0
he is not somebody who shouts and screams in the changing room but i certainly would n’t want to get on the wrong side of him			0
‘ he is stubborn and determined			0
he has got a real desire to win , like everyone at this club			0

@entity0 has shone in a **defensive** role for @entity4 lately
his performances have eased @entity4 's **defensive** injury *concerns*
but @entity0 believes his strongest position will always be in midfield
