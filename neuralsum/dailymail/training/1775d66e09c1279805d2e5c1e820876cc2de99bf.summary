by @entity0 a recent study has suggested children with stressed parents are more likely to be fat as they get older stressed parents are more likely to have obese children , a study has warned			1
children whose parents have high levels of stress have a @entity10 , or @entity10 , about two per cent higher than those whose parents have low levels of stress			1
they also gained weight seven per cent faster than other children , the @entity15 study claimed			1
researcher dr @entity19 warned if not stopped at an early age , weight gain will continue to lead to health problems later in the children 's lives			1
he said : ‘ childhood is a time when we develop inter-connected habits related to how we deal with stress , how we eat and how active we are			0
‘ it ’s a time when we might be doing irreversible damage or damage that is very hard to change later			0
’ dr @entity19 said it was not clear why the link between stress and obesity existed			0
he said parents might change their behaviour when they were stressed , buying more ready meals or junk food to save time rather than preparing healthy meals			2
parental stress could also have a knock on effect for the children , who in turn cope by eating more and exercising less , or whose stress leads to biological changes that cause weight gain			2
the study by @entity51 , @entity52 , looked at data collected during the @entity54 , one of the largest and most comprehensive investigations into the long - term effects of air pollution on the respiratory health of children			0
the childrens ' @entity10 was calculated each year and their parents were given a questionnaire to measure their perceived psychological stress			1
it asked how often in the last month they were able or unable to control important things in their life and whether things were going their way or their difficulties were piling up so high they could not overcome them			0
experts claim changes in parents ' behavior such as buying more ready meals or junk food to save time when they are stressed could be a factor in the results ( file photo ) rather than focusing only on getting parents to change their behaviour , more needed to be done to support families such as making sure they have a reliable supply of healthy food or improving living conditions			2
he noted that more than half the students followed in the @entity92 study were @entity93 , and that the effects of stress on their @entity10 was greater than children of other ethnic backgrounds			1
this was consistent with other research which has suggested that @entity93 children may be more likely to experience hypherphasia , excessive hunger or increased appetite , and sedentary lifestyle			0
the study was published in the journal @entity107 .			0

@entity109 found children with stressed parents had higher @entity10 than others
they also gained weight seven per cent faster than peers
