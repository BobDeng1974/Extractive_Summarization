the couple and a few guests who were staying over headed to bed not long after midnight once the party was over			2

they had first met through a friend and had seen each other intermittently over the years , mainly on canoeing trips in @entity85 with mutual friends			2
he said : ' in the run up to the party he had checked with us if any single women were going to be there - he was frustrated that he was still single			2
' we knew that he was also pretty stressed out at work and that money was a bit of an issue for him , but we 'd thought that our party would just be a chance to relax			2
' ' but the thought never crossed my mind that he would be violent			0
' when the case finally came to an end and @entity17 was given an indeterminate jail sentence with a 13 - year minimum tariff			2
ms @entity10 said : ' we 'd moved from @entity52 to @entity11 to be closer to @entity9 's parents , who were unwell , and had invited lots of friends to celebrate the new chapter in our lives			1

but in may , 2010 , the pair were left with catastrophic injuries after friend @entity17 crept into their room while they were sleeping and stabbed them both in the head ' the house was a stunning four - bedroom detached former @entity125 superintendent 's home with a huge garden so we 'd had a barbeque and been playing games all afternoon - we even played rounders on the village green			1
' she added : ' our physical injuries were only a fraction of what we experienced			0
it was the mental horror , the post-traumatic stress which caused us the most pain and anguish			0
' when we woke up in hospital after the attack we were shocked that we were even alive - the doctors had n't expected us to make it			0
' we came round and just looked at each other with tears streaming down our faces			0
@entity17 ( left and right ) , 39 at the time and a chef , went into their kitchen , took a knife and crept up to their bedroom to attack them , with absolutely no warning or apparent reason			1
the court heard he had approached several different women at the party but his advances had been turned down each time ' one thing that gave us relief in the very tough times was the idea of us both floating on a raft , letting go of all the anxiety and things we could n't control - just ' going with the flow '			2
the couple have since set up @entity173 , an organisation to share what they had learnt overcoming their experience and to help others			0
ms @entity10 said : ' before the attack , @entity9 and i were both very career - driven			1
we both had older children from previous relationships and we 'd never even considered having a child together			0
' but our long road to recovery made us re-evaluate our lives			0
' we started meditating and we realised we wanted to refocus our lives around our family instead of our careers , and we had @entity13 in 2014			0
' she has been a little angel that arrived to finish of the healing process			0
' if we had n't have nearly died that night , we would n't be nearly as happy as we are today			0
' ' it 's been a long , long road to recovery but we 're proud to say that our lives are better now than they were before that evening			0
' it was a blessing in disguise and has given us a second chance at life			0
