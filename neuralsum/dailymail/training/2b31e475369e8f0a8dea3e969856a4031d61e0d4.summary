by @entity1 reporter published : 06:44 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 12 january 2013 targeted : @entity2 was threatened with arrest a gay man claims he ’s been labelled a ' serious criminal ' by police because of a relationship he had in the army 30 years ago			1
officers threatened 50 - year - old @entity2 with arrest unless he provided a dna sample as part of a controversial crime crackdown mr @entity2 was sentenced to six months in prison in 1983 after he admitted having sex with a male colleague while serving with the @entity17 in @entity18			1
although homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967 it remained an offence in the armed forces until 1994 and the ban on homosexuals serving in the @entity25 was not lifted until 2000			2
mr @entity2 , from @entity26 , was discharged from the army after being charged with gross indecency and he was later convicted of sexual assault in a military court as both he and his partner were under 21 , the legal age of consent for gay sex at the time			2
he said he was stunned when police arrived at his home last sunday and demanded he provide a dna sample			2
he said : ' if you look at the details of my criminal record , i ca n’t see what possible threat i ’m meant to pose to the public and why i ’ve been targeted by @entity44 find it completely ridiculous			1
' @entity45 ( @entity45 ) said they were ' concerned about the particular issues ' mr @entity2 ’s case had raised			1
the force launched @entity49 last year in a bid to collect dna samples from 2,000 people convicted of serious crimes			0
the operation , using controversial new powers under the @entity56 2010 , saw samples added to a dna database in a bid to match suspects to unsolved crimes			0
cap badge of the @entity17 if ex-offenders refuse to provide a sample , officers have the power under the act to force them to comply			0
the act mr @entity2 was convicted for is no longer illegal as the age of homosexual sex was lowered to 18 in 1994 and then 16 in 2001			0
he told the @entity71 : ' if i did the same thing today , it would not longer be considered illegal			0
yet the police still want my dna on record and to me it just begs the question ‘ why ? ’ ” @entity45 ’s deputy chief constable @entity78 said that @entity75 samples from convicted offences allowed the force to ' look for potential matches with dna evidence recovered from previously unsolved crimes			1
' but he added : ' we do understand the very personal and sensitive issues that mr @entity2 has raised			0
' we are concerned about the particular issues his case raises and therefore we would invite him to make direct contact with @entity45 so we can review his case			1

' i ca *n't* see what possible threat i pose and why i *'ve* been targeted '
@entity45 chief *promises* a review of the case
