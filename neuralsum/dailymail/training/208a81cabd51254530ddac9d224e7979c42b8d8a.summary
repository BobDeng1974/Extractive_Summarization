these striking pictures show @entity2 @entity1 praying for their lives and livelihoods - as just a few miles away , @entity6 militants fight to take both away from them			1
the men and women who went to @entity10 yesterday at @entity11 in @entity12 , northern @entity2 , form part of a fast - dwindling minority as extremists sweep through their nation enforcing a violent interpretation of @entity18			1
only a thin line of @entity21 fighters , supported by a few hundred @entity23 troops , separate them from the violence which has engulfed wide stretches of @entity2 , including the city of @entity27 50 miles away			1
pictured , women pray in a @entity10 at @entity11 in the @entity21 capital @entity12 , which has so far remained untouched dwindling : reports say the number of @entity1 in @entity2 has dropped sharply over the last decade militants have threatened those who do not follow their interpretation of @entity18 with death			1
@entity1 , because of their association with the @entity41 , are among the most hated by the @entity42			0
others in peril include the @entity47 people , tens of thousands of whom were besieged on a mountaintop in desperate need of food and water by @entity6 militants			0
many @entity1 have fled the country in the latest crisis , adding to the numbers which observers say have been trickling out since the 2003 war and the insurgencies that followed			2
reports claimed there were 1.5million @entity60 in 2003 , but this number dropped to less than 500,000 last year			2
some estimates of the current number have been as low as 200,000			0
minorities : non-muslims are particularly vulnerable to the militants , who threaten their enemies with slaughter despite the danger , the church remains similar to those in the @entity41 , with rounded windows and wooden pews others , however , have remained in @entity12			0
the @entity21 regional capital , which has 1.5million residents , has remained mostly untouched by the militants - but not by the killing sprees they have caused			1
many of what used to be @entity2 's biggest @entity1 strongholds have already been taken by the militants , including the second city of @entity27 and the city of @entity85			1
thousands of refugees have flooded into the areas around @entity12 , which is home to the sprawling @entity89 refugee camp			0
more than 1.8million people have been displaced across @entity2 since the rapid advance by @entity6 militants first began in january , according to the @entity93			0
even in towns near @entity12 which have been seized back by the @entity21 , residents are unwilling to return			2
one , @entity96 , has been left as a ghost town after its 20,000 citizens were too frightened to go back			0
@entity100 : many @entity1 have fled @entity2 in the crisis , but others have stayed firmly in cities such as @entity12 under siege : a recent study shows the extent to which @entity6 militants have swept through @entity2 @entity21 peshmerga forces are left to patrol the streets , where the phrase ' @entity6 ' is daubed on many buildings			1
in many cases it is misspelled to read @entity114 state - state of peace - a sign that many of the militants holding the town were probably foreign fighters			0
@entity12 is also home to @entity23 troops who are bolstering @entity21 forces in their fight against the militants			1
overall around 1,500 @entity23 military personnel are in @entity2 , many of them embedded with the country 's security forces to find targets for air strikes			2
the @entity23 has launched more than 150 such strikes against the militants , which could be stepped up after the beheading of @entity136 hostage @entity134 .			0
