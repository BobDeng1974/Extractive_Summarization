by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 22 august 2013 red alert : carrot tops such as @entity3 carry a gene mutation that lowers their skin cell dna protection against deadly sunlight damage prince @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity3 all share a deadly secret linked to their carroty locks			1
the gene responsible for red hair also leaves a person up to 100 times more susceptible to the worst form of skin cancer , scientists have shown			1
it was always known that fair - skinned red - heads are at greater risk of melanoma , which claims more than 2,000 lives a year in the @entity23			1
now @entity25 researchers believe they have discovered why			0
a particular gene mutation that colours hair red leaves dna in skin cells more prone to damaged by sunlight			1
laboratory and mouse experiments showed that the @entity35 - @entity34 gene variant both lowered a cell 's guard against harmful ultraviolet ( @entity39 ) rays , and stimulated cancer - causing biological signals			2
@entity34 stands for ' red hair colour '			0
study leader dr @entity43 , from @entity44 in @entity45 , said : ' together , our findings provide a possible molecular mechanism as to why red - haired individuals harboring @entity35 mutations are much more susceptible to uv - induced skin damage than individuals with darker skin , resulting in a 10 to 100-fold higher frequency of melanoma			1
' it all adds up to bad news for @entity7 and others of his ilk			0
melanoma is diagnosed in about 13,000 people each year in the @entity23 and is responsible for three quarters of all skin cancer deaths			1
the cancer originates in pigment - producing skin cells called melanocytes			2
previous research had shown that the melanocortin - 1 receptor ( @entity35 ) gene plays a key role in protecting melanocytes from uv - induced dna damage			2
under normal circumstances @entity35 binds to and protects another gene well known for its ability to suppress tumours , @entity77			0
the new work demonstrates that the red hair version of @entity35 no longer acts as a @entity77 guardian			0
' as a result , upon uvb exposure , we saw an increased destruction of @entity77 in the mutated pigment cells , ' said dr @entity43			0
the same mutation was linked to the ramping up of a biological signalling pathway , @entity89 which is implicated in a number of cancers , including breast , ovarian and lung			1
other red - heads such as prince @entity7 and @entity8 should take extra care in the sun a further connection was found with a mutation in the braf gene which is found in 70 per cent of human melanomas			2
scientists say there is also a glimmer of light in the findings , reported online in the journal @entity110			0
the research could open up avenues of study leading to new melanoma treatments or ways of identifying highly at - risk individuals			1
' we think that @entity35 variants , in combination with mutations in the braf gene , could be used as markers of an increased risk of developing melanoma , ' said dr @entity43			0
there was also a suggestion that compounds that inhibit @entity128 / @entity89 could be combined with the skin cancer drug vemurafenib to treat some melanomas .			0

@entity133 mutation in red heads makes skin dna more susceptible to @entity39 damage
melanoma claims more than 2,000 lives a year in @entity23
same *abnormality* may also be linked to breast , ovarian and lung cancer
findings open - up new ways to identify at - risk individuals
