by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 21 february 2013 an unknown amateur artist 's paintings are set to make his family £ 200,000 because abandoned work by @entity5 was found hidden on the back			1
the celebrated artist used the canvases to paint his famous ' screaming pope ' series of images on in the 1950s			0
but @entity5 was a ruthless self - critic and trashed his work if he was n't satisfied with it			1
he gave some large , discarded canvases to struggling amateur artist @entity15 on the strict instructions he had to rip them up before using them			2
unseen work by @entity20 artist @entity5 has been found on the back of an amateur artist 's work			1
@entity5 gave @entity15 the discarded canvases			1
it is believed to be worth £ 200,000 valuable : @entity27 's work			2
his family discovered the @entity30 artworks on the back of them after mr @entity15 died mr @entity15 used the reverse of the canvases to paint his still - life scenes and portraits on at his studio in @entity38			1
after he died in 2006 , the two - sided paintings were passed down to members of mr @entity15 's family , who only then realised parts of @entity5 's works were on the back			1
@entity5 's paintings on the reverse are a series of lines and colours , thought to create the background of the ' screaming pope ' pieces			1
the ripped - up canvases measure 2ft by 3ft each and without @entity5 's work would be worth hardly anything			1
but auctioneers selling the six double - sided paintings have put a pre-sale estimate of £ 100,000 on them , but would n't be surprised if they fetch twice that amount			2
@entity61 , of @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , said : ' @entity5 donated his pieces to a struggling artist , @entity15			1
amateur artist @entity15 was given the canvas by @entity5 , under the instruction that he must cut them up ' @entity5 had a thing about his work that he was n't happy with it falling into the wrong hands and going into the public domain and market , so if he did n't like it he would destroy it			1
' he preferred to paint on the back of a canvas , so he thought these discarded piecescould be used by another artist , but only if he cut them up before using them			0
genius : artist @entity5 photographed in front of some his work at @entity87 , @entity88 , in 1977 ' the images are from a series of @entity92 paintings before @entity5 was very famous and without his work on the back , they would be worth almost nothing			2
' if it was a completed @entity30 piece they would be worth much more			0
one of the screaming pope series sold last november for £ 18.7million			0
' @entity5 was painting popes at that time and it was all to do with the @entity102 , i think he thought the @entity103 had been ineffective so it was a bit of a rebellion			0
' mr @entity61 says he does n't know how many of these discarded @entity107 canvases are in existence but hopes that people who have a @entity15 painting will look on the back to see if they have a @entity5 piece			1
he added : ' people have n't necessarily got the money to buy proper @entity5 paintings , so this is an opportunity to buy something from the hand of the artist			1
two of the oil paintings are expected to fetch £ 30,000 each			0
one shows the leg of a chair on the reverse and the other shows the arm of a pope			0
three pieces are expected to sell for £ 20,000			0
one which shows a set of curtain rings on a black background , another the yellow and white edge of a chair and the third a series of vertical black stripes			0
the final canvas , which has not been looked at by the the @entity139 of @entity5 , is expected to reach £ 10,000			0
@entity5 was born in @entity140 in 1909 and was known for his disturbing imagery and use of religious themes			0
