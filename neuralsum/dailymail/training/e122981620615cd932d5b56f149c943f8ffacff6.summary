by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 05:17 est , 26 november 2012 prince @entity1 jokingly admitted that he is impatient prince @entity1 , the longest - waiting heir to the throne in @entity4 history , has spoken of his ' impatience ' to get things done			1
joking about the vigour with which he pursues his pet projects , he declared : ' impatient ? me ? what a thing to suggest ! yes , of course i am			1
' he added : ' i 'll run out of time soon			1
i shall have snuffed it if i 'm not careful			2
' @entity1 was speaking a few days before his 64th birthday during a visit to @entity16 , a stately home in @entity17 he has helped save for the nation			1
the comments , which were recorded for a film on the @entity22 website , were in the context of his involvement with @entity16			1
but they will fuel speculation that the @entity1 is more eager than ever to take the throne			2
in 2008 , he became the longest - waiting heir in @entity4 history , overtaking his great - great grandfather @entity30 courtiers insist @entity1 is fulfilled by his present role as one of the hardest - working members of the royal family , undertaking hundreds of charitable engagements a year			2
but many royal commentators have suggested he feels frustrated his reign has not yet begun			0
with a history of longevity in his family – the @entity39 is 86 and in good health while the @entity44 lived to 101 – @entity1 may have some time to wait until he succeeds his mother			0
he has nothing but praise for the way the @entity39 has led her country for 60 years			0
but he has previously hinted at his impatience with the long wait for succession			0
in 1992 , when his then - brother - in - law @entity53 became @entity54 on the death of his father , @entity1 told him : ' you are fortunate enough to have succeeded to the title when still young			0
' professor @entity66 , director of @entity68 's constitution unit , said @entity1 had to fit a unique job description			0
' he is an age when most people are starting to contemplate retirement , yet he 's not actually started the job he has spent his adult life preparing for			0
' royal biographer @entity76 said : ' he is impatient , but when he becomes king , his activities and all the projects he most enjoys where he can make a difference will be seriously curtailed			1
