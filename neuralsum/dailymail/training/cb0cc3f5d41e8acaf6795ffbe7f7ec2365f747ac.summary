the body of @entity1 was found wrapped in plastic and buried under logs in the @entity4 former @entity6 police officers have expressed concern that the senseless murder of 14 - year - old @entity1 bears disturbing parallels with two other unsolved cases from the same area			1
this week , @entity13 's body was found wrapped in plastic and buried under logs in a @entity17 river			1
the murder investigation has a prime suspect , @entity19 , a convicted murderer from @entity20 , who vanished from his home in west @entity17 , days after @entity13 went missing			1
but former @entity23 police officers are worried about the striking similarities between @entity13 's murder and two unsolved cases from the @entity17 borough of @entity28			1
in april 1999 , a 19 - year - old student , @entity29 , left @entity30 and was caught on cctv walking home along the @entity33 near @entity28 police station			1
she was never seen again			0
her sister , @entity35 , has never given up hope of being reunited with her sibling			0
she said : ' we want @entity39 to know that we love her and miss her very much			0
' nine months later , in january 2000 , @entity40 , 27 , an @entity41 - born computer graduate , got off a bus outside @entity44 station near @entity46 station			1
she too disappeared without trace			2
both instances occurred within a few hundred yards of the spot where @entity13 went missing on august 28			2
the victims all went missing at busy times of the day and their disappearances went unnoticed by members of the public			1
they told @entity67 , of the @entity68 : ' the odds against three girls disappearing or being murdered in such a small area of @entity17 , even over a 14 - year period , are astronomical			1
' @entity74 murders on lone young females walking in the street during the day by a man unknown to them are extremely rare occurrences in the @entity79			0
' the vast majority of victims are known to their attackers and any such cases always become big news stories			2
there are only ever two or three a year nationally , if that			0
' whoever killed these girls showed considerable coolness , sophistication in avoiding being seen during the act , and avoiding capture			0
' the killings took place out of sight and sound of the public , as did the subsequent disposal of the bodies			0
this latter aspect takes considerable planning and coolness on the part of the attacker , raising the question of whether there was more than one attacker			0
' all the above circumstances are extremely rare in any case of murder , let alone in such a small area of @entity17			2
' @entity13 's body was recovered from the @entity4 in west @entity17 on wednesday , a month after she vanished @entity112 said the disappearance of @entity20 builder @entity19 made him the prime suspect in the inquiry in to @entity13 's murder the @entity6 said @entity29 and @entity40 were strongly suspected to have been murdered by @entity118 , a convicted rapist and murderer from @entity120 who died in 2009			1
@entity118 , known as ' @entity121 ' , was questioned in 2004 but the @entity6 never found any hard evidence against him			2
but officers who were involved in the murder inquiries disputed that claim , although they accepted he was a ' good suspect '			2
elsewhere , former met officers told the @entity68 that the disappearance of @entity20 @entity128 made him the prime suspect in the inquiry			1
the source was also concerned at the delays in contacting @entity20 police over @entity128 ' whereabouts , although the police dispute any such delays			2
privately , several retired detectives are shocked it took the @entity6 five days to launch a murder inquiry into @entity13 's disappearance			1
one said : ' it was an unacceptable delay			0
a 14 - year - old girl should have been classed a high - risk missing person and the murder inquiry should have started after 24 hours - particularly when the police realised her phone was not working			1
' vital forensic leads may have been lost for ever after it took police more than a month to find @entity13 's body			1
the @entity6 faces questions over the time it took to find @entity13 's body in shallow water just yards from where her rucksack was found aerial shot reveals how close @entity13 's body was found to her rucksack and where police had earlier searched in the hours after @entity13 's body was found , her family said in a statement : ' we have been left completely devastated by the recent developments and it is difficult to comprehend that our sweet and beautiful daughter was the victim of a terrible crime			1
' why anyone would want to hurt her is something that we are struggling to come to terms with			0
' @entity13 was a loving and much loved daughter and sister , a quirky live spark of a girl , beautiful inside and out			0
she was a funny companion , a loyal friend , both passionate and compassionate , and so talented with a bright future ahead of her			0
she brought so much joy to our family and those who knew her			0
' we still do n't know who is responsible for this crime and we ask that people continue to help the police by giving them information that could help bring the perpetrator to justice			0
