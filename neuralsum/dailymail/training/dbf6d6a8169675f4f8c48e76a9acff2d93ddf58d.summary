@entity8 has turned down numerous offers from the council to move from his childhood home in @entity12 , @entity13			1
but he is not budging from the home , even though he has no neighbours and no community			2
@entity17 : @entity8 is now the last resident left in an old council estate in @entity12 which was once made up of 600 homes isolated : @entity22 's home is the only landmark on a desolate stretch of scrubland left after the council estate was demolished all alone : mr @entity8 's home , circled in red , is now the last inhabited building on a site where once stood 600 homes mr @entity8 said : ' i was born in this house and i have been here for 62 years			1
' my mum got the house after the @entity36 and she brought ten of us up in here			2
i ’m the last one and i ’m staying here			2
' this was one of the best estates ever			0
we had everything but now we have nothing , not even neighbours			0
' i used to have hundreds of neighbours but now it ’s just us			2
' mr @entity8 ’s house is bookended by two partially demolished buildings and lies on a street surrounded by wasteland			1
@entity53 : in the 1960s , the street was full of houses last man standing : @entity8 refuses to leave the house where he was born 62 years ago despite requests from the council to vacate the property bygone times : it was a thriving road which had a cafe and had a steady flow of traffic changed : this is how the land around @entity68 looked in 1936			1
most of the housing has now been demolished despite not being much to look at , he loves his home , and his sense of pride can be seen through the flagpole flying a @entity75 in his back garden			1
having been born and bred in the home alongside his nine brothers and sisters , his family eventually bought the house from the council			1
but mr @entity8 is refusing to give it back without a fight			1
home sweet home : @entity8 has lost all of his neighbours as , one by one , their homes have been knocked down by the council determined : mr @entity8 has refused to leave the house he bought off the council without a fight he said : ' i do n’t need anyone to fight my battles but if the council wants a war , it ’s got a war because i ’m staying here			1
' at one time around here , everyone had families			0
they grew up and stayed for years and there was real community spirit			2
alone : mr @entity8 grew up on the estate playing with friends in the street by now has no neighbours ' there were nice five - bedroomed houses and people like living here			1
i look around now and ca n’t believe it ’s all gone			0
the situation angers and upsets me			0
' the reason given by the council when they wanted to clear the area was that there was too much housing stock and no - one to live there			0
' that ’s rubbish , because i have spoken to friends who used to live here , who say they would give anything to move back - if there was anything to move back to			0
the estate , which lies near to @entity12 ’s docks , was once a sea of 600 post-war houses , home to thousands of workers who sustained the manufacturing and shipbuilding industries			1
plans were put into place to clear homes to make way for new factories , but the jobs and investment failed to materialise , leaving the area desolate and unkept			2
while 14,000 people from the estate were once employed in the industrial sector , this dropped to just 1,300 by the mid 1980s , causing the area to slip towards poverty - however there was still a sense of community for families			0
mr @entity8 , a former boilerman and shop steward , said : ' we use to play on these streets as kids			1
kids grew up , got married and got a house on the estate			2
their kids would go and see their gran			0

all of our family was brought up on this estate and i ’m the last one out of the lot			0
