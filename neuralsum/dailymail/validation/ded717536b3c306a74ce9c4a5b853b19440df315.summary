@entity0 hailed his second - half winner against @entity2 as ' the most important goal ' of his @entity5 career			1
with 55 minutes on the clock and the scoreline locked at 1 - 1 after @entity8 had cancelled out @entity10 's opener , the @entity11 trapped a long punt forward by @entity13 and then arrowed the ball past @entity15 to restore @entity5 's lead at the @entity17			1
@entity19 's side went on to dominate the remainder of the game and won 2 - 1 , thus building a four - point advantage at the top of the @entity25 table			1
@entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity13 , @entity29 and @entity30 get suited and booted after the triumph goalscoring hero @entity0 poses for a pic with fellow frontmen @entity26 and @entity29 after the victory @entity0 fires home the winner past @entity15 to send @entity5 on their way to victory @entity0 celebrates scoring the goal that sent @entity5 four points clear at the top of @entity25 the strike was @entity0 's 14th in all competitions for @entity5 since he made his Â£ 75million move from @entity44 last summer			1
and the 28 - year - old had no doubt this was his most crucial goal for his new club , ranking it above the two he netted against @entity50 in the @entity51 last month			2
' this is the most important goal i 've scored for @entity5 and it has an extra significance because of the rival we were playing against , ' @entity0 told @entity5 's official television channel			1
' i just tried to take advantage of the space between defenders and be as fast as i could so i did n't give the centre - backs any time to recover			0
' the dressing room is very happy , we knew this was a really important game if we wanted to stay top of the league and increase our advantage			0
' @entity5 coach @entity19 sang the striker 's praises after the game , calling the goal ' an action that only few players are capable of '			1
' we are very happy that he is a being decisive player for us and we are very happy with his attitude and what he brings to this team , ' he said			0
' he brings a lot to the team he is not just a classic centre forward , he also links up with his team - mates			0
he 's a player that marvellously compliments the squad we have , and that 's why we signed him			2
' @entity10 headed home the opening goal for @entity5 in the first half @entity8 equalised for @entity2 but was unable to stamp his authority on the game @entity2 now have 10 weeks to catch up with @entity5 , who have won 19 of their 21 matches in 2015			1
@entity2 coach @entity94 lamented the fact his side failed to keep a ' cool head ' after the break , following their strong performance in the opening 45 minutes			2
' we were playing very well until their second goal and from then on the game was very difficult for us , ' said the @entity105 in his post-match press conference			0
' before that we were doing well , we pressed well and were solid at the back			0
we lacked a cool head to turn the game around , we kept playing long balls and trying to execute difficult passages of play			0
' this is @entity94 's third defeat in four league games against @entity5 and , if his side can not bridge the four - point gap with the @entity115 , he will have failed to win the @entity117 league title in his first two seasons with @entity2			1
however , the man who delivered @entity2 their long awaited 10th @entity51 last season dismissed the suggestion his side would now focus their attention on the @entity51 , with a quarter - final tie against neighbours @entity126 coming up next month			2
he said : ' the league is not over , they have the same points advantage that we had before but anything could happen			0
' we 're not going to give a priority to either competition , the priority for us is the league and the @entity51			0
