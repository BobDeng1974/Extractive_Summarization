he used his time to read and had many pen friends and was a very interesting man			1
' after exchanging several letters , @entity10 began visiting @entity32 during the summer holidays from her teaching job			1

' @entity10 continued to visit @entity32 up until his execution , aged 37 , in 2008 , which she attended			1
' it was very traumatic			2
i was ok for a couple of weeks afterwards and then i had a bit of post-traumatic stress and i could n't sleep , ' she said			2
' but everyone at home was very supportive			0
' i am not in favour of the death penalty as you can not always be certain you have the right man or woman			0
' @entity99 ( left ) was part of a gang that robbed and killed two people and has since developed a talent for sketching the paintings and sketches are all the more remarkable as they must be made using crudely fashioned objects as prisoners are not allowed certain materials in case they use them as weapons			1
the killers and sex offenders are only allowed to use the ink taken from the plastic casing of biros and paint is made by melting coloured pencils			0
@entity58 who paints @entity62 , murdered @entity120 in 1987 after breaking into her home as she was packing for a holiday to @entity123			0

' i discovered that quite a lot of the @entity15 prisoners were talented at art. they are locked up all day and do n't have much to do			1
' they are not allowed things like biros , in case they use them as knives , so they are just given the ink and have to improvise			0
' one prisoner , @entity58 , gets round the fact he does n't have paint by melting coloured pencils			0
' their work often has themes of freedom or religion			0
it shows that even people who may have committed acts can achieve extraordinary things if given the chance			0
