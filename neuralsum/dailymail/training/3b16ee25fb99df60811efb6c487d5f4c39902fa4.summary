the day @entity1 striker @entity0 gave @entity2 the runaround at football made the @entity6 lock realise he should stick to rugby			1
towards the end of his three years at the @entity9 , @entity2 was given a tough time by @entity0 in a junior game against @entity12			1
@entity2 was 14 at the time and the experience helped him to decide that he should turn his attention to the oval ball			2
@entity6 ’s @entity2 charges forward against @entity16 earlier this month @entity2 is pushing for a @entity18 call - up after an impressive start to the season @entity2 , @entity1 club : @entity6 , @entity22 : wolves , football position : centre half @entity26 – @entity6 – @entity28 - goalkeeper @entity29 – sale – @entity30 – left back @entity31 – sale – @entity32 – left wing @entity34 – harlequins – @entity30 – centre midfield @entity37 – harlequins – @entity40 - striker @entity41 – @entity42 – @entity43 – centre midfield @entity45 – @entity42 – @entity46 – right wing @entity50 - @entity49 - @entity48 – centre half the decision paid off and the 6ft 6in and 19st forward is currently knocking on the door for a @entity18 call - up			1
however , there was a time when he seemed more likely to pursue a career as a centre half , rather than a second - row			0
‘ i flirted with football for a couple of years , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ at @entity63 , we went on tour and played against teams like @entity66 and @entity48			0
‘ i played against @entity0 when i was 14			1
i was marking him — or trying to ! as you ’d expect , he was n’t a bad player and was a pretty big unit back in the day			0
' he gave a few of us the runaround , but at the time you did n’t really appreciate what he would go on to achieve			2
’ @entity0 now earns around £ 150,000 a week , while salaries in rugby are a relative drop in the ocean			1
but @entity2 recognised the slim chances involved with pursuing football ’s mega-bucks and instead completed his a-levels and signed for @entity84			1
@entity0 gave @entity2 the runaround during an academy game between @entity63 and @entity12 out of his academy age - group at @entity63 , only @entity87 went on to play in the @entity89 as most failed to make the cut in an extremely competitive market			1
but doors to the senior ranks opened quickly when @entity2 turned his focus to rugby			1
‘ i realised i was a bit more suited to the rugby environment with my size and that kind of thing , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ there were a few transferable skills — we focused a lot on agility and speed over a short distance , which always helps			0
@entity2 has no regrets turning his back on football to pursue a career in rugby ‘ we would train about three times a week at @entity63 — it was tough , but not a lot of people made it so i did n’t see a massive future in the game			1
’ @entity2 is not the only ex-footballer to make the switch			2
as with a hard - hitting forward , natural size and strength is a valuable asset for a goalkeeper or defender			0
@entity26 and @entity125 are both former keepers who went on to play in the pack , while @entity50 and @entity2 were centre halves who joined rugby ’s heavies in the tight - five			2
physicality is not such an important asset in the back - line and some of @entity1 ’s most skilful playmakers have backgrounds as wing backs , midfielders and strikers			0
@entity42 full back @entity41 is one of the most intelligent readers of the game — previously he conducted play as a central midfielder for @entity43			0
@entity16 star @entity37 used to play as a strike for @entity40 before switching to rugby @entity16 scrum - half @entity37 is known for his ability to snipe around the fringes of the breakdown and he used to run lines through the defence as a nippy striker for @entity40			0
similarly , @entity29 , @entity34 , @entity45 and @entity31 all played further up the field in football before becoming astute backs in rugby			2
at @entity159 , @entity2 is often seen breaking clear of defenders , in a way you would not expect from a man of his size			0
his footwork and quick change of balance helps keep defenders guessing and his form has earned him a consistent run in @entity6 ’s starting xv			0
director of rugby @entity173 has rotated his squad for tonight ’s @entity177 tie against @entity178 , with @entity2 on the bench alongside @entity1 hooker @entity180 and @entity182 hopeful @entity181			1
@entity2 is aiming high and has targeted a first cap for @entity1 but @entity2 has international ambitions			1
after playing for the @entity186 and being called up as injury cover for the @entity188 , he is now hoping to go one better and win his first cap			0
‘ i loved being involved in the autumn and i ’d be lying if i said i was n’t thinking about it , ’ said @entity2			0
‘ the reality is there are a lot of quality second - rows around @entity1 at the moment , so i just have to see how it goes			0

@entity2 played against footballer @entity0 at youth level
@entity6 lock *admits* @entity1 striker gave him the runaround
@entity2 decided to quit football to focus his efforts on rugby instead
