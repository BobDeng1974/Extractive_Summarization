if @entity1 should flip six or more @entity3 seats on tuesday , they 'll control both houses of @entity5 for the first time in ten years , opening up a host of possibilities that the @entity9 - run @entity3 has blocked under the currently majority leader , @entity11 sen. @entity10			1
obamacare as we know it ? no longer a guaranteed keeper			0
immigration reform ? maybe , but on @entity1 ' terms			1
regulations that bring out the @entity19 in every conservative ? dead , at least for a time			0
some legislation will still be off the table since president @entity24 has a veto pen at the ready – and because @entity1 themselves are n't unified about how to respond to what @entity27 have put in place in recent years			1
but the legislative game would be changed in some important and earth - shattering ways			0
every @entity3 committee will have a @entity1 chairman or chairwoman in january if the @entity1 wins control on tuesday			1
that will allow them to slow - walk legislation , or entirely refuse to entertain it , in the same way @entity10 has done since 2007			0
the powerful @entity41 , especially , would become a game - changer , turning on its head the @entity45 's calculations when it chooses to appoint judges – including the next nominees to serve on the @entity48			1
in smaller ways , cogs in @entity24 's governmental machine would find themselves , one at a time , without teeth			2
all that 's required is for both houses of @entity5 to pass joint resolutions noting their disapproval			2
just like that , the government rule in question is stopped in its tracks and robbed of any effect			0
such resolutions require just a simple majority to pass in the @entity3 , meaning that with just 51 seats the @entity1 could team up with an expanding @entity45 majority to crush , or at least delay , a wide range of @entity24 administration initiatives during the president 's last term in office			1
@entity24 's signature is still required on a resolution overturning a regulation , just like anything else that emerges from @entity5			1
but while the @entity45 wrangles over its pr strategy , the regulatory proposal would sit and collect dust			0
republicans would then announce their intention to override the veto , an unlikely proposition since they lack two - thirds majorities in either house			2
but that process could be dragged out , and the @entity68 would halt the regulation in question until 30 days after they officially give up			1
everything from the administration 's @entity72 rules on coal - fired power plants and water pollution to minimum - wage hikes and unpopular moves that open the borders to @entity121 patients could be open for debate , producing consistent howls from @entity27 along the way			2
we 'll finally find out if it 's possible to @entity128 on a larger stage , changing or repealing the @entity130 law would be the ultimate prize for conservatives in the @entity1			1
@entity27 passed it during the president 's first term in office , when they controlled both houses of @entity5			1
not a single @entity1 voted in favor of the final bill			0
@entity24 at first resisted the @entity1 's demands for changes to the law , but then put his own in place to delay its phased - in implementation until after the election			1
that has brought howls out of the right - wing 's woodwork , and the threat of a lawsuit from @entity45 @entity1 since precise , hard - and - fast dates were written into the law			1
@entity24 , they say , lacked the power to change how the law was implemented without permission from @entity5			1
conservatives like @entity161 sen. @entity160 favor sending a complete repeal bill to the @entity45 now that @entity130 – and @entity24 himself – are wildly unpopular			1
that itself would be tough since it 's practically impossible that @entity1 will hold 60 seats , the number required to force an end to a debate and call for a vote on legislation			2
but current senate majority leader @entity55 has signaled that he 's willing to use a special budget maneuver called ' reconciliation ' to get around that , setting the bar at just 51 votes			0
@entity10 invoked something similar in 2013 for the first time in @entity178 's history – a play known as the ' nuclear option ' – to confirm a group of controversial judicial nominees without @entity1 support			2
now it could be @entity186 's turn to move the levers			0
should the president veto an @entity130 repeal bill or let it languish until it expires ( a so - called ' pocket veto ' ) , right - wingers would then urge their leadership to pass a rapid - fire series of laws repealing @entity130 one piece at a time , forcing @entity24 to issue veto after veto and rebranding @entity27 as ' the party of " no "			2
' will he stick around ? if longtime majority leader @entity10 loses his top post , the @entity11 @entity201 might shirk the role of minority leader in favor of returning to the back bench voters in many states have been casting ballots for weeks , but d - day officially comes tuesday @entity212 's @entity211 the @entity45 will certainly hunker down in any event , portraying the @entity130 as a blessing for the previously uninsured			2
republicans will follow their lawsuit through the federal courts			0
another game - changer could see an oil pipeline bringing unrefined petroleum from the expansive tar sands of @entity222 , @entity212 to the @entity161 coastline on the @entity224			1
the idea was described ten years ago as a job - creation miracle and a way to lower energy costs all across @entity178			0
but president @entity24 's @entity229 , prodded by environmental groups , has slow - walked the project , crashing into hurdle after hurdle seemingly on purpose			1
@entity212 desperately wants the project to move forward			0
the alternative is to pipe as many as 830,000 barrels of oil westward every day toward the @entity240 , where it would be refined and shipped to @entity242			0
if the @entity17 were built as planned , much of the finished fuel would go to @entity244 and @entity245 no matter what , but green groups have struck a ' not in our backyard ' pose and urged the @entity45 to delay it as long as possible			2
but the @entity229 's own review board ruled in january , after years of study , that the project would have a negligible impact on the environment			0
whither @entity130 ? with @entity3 and @entity45 conservatives both holding @entity258 's car keys , it 's not clear how much of the president 's hard - won medical insurance overhaul would survive by the end of his term armed with that document , a @entity1 - run @entity5 would likely pass a bill immediately funding the project and forcing @entity24 's hand			1
the @entity45 's public position has long been that it 's not stalling – merely enduring a lengthy deliberative process to make sure it 's doing no harm			1
republicans will force the issue if they win control of the @entity3			0
and enough @entity27 want the project built that @entity24 may have no choice but to go along			0
illegal immigrants could go from protected class to endangered species they will also push back hard against what they see as @entity24 's lawless moves to remake immigration policy in a way that gives unreasonable advantages to people who are in the @entity286 illegally			1
at stake , they say , are the potential bankrupting of the @entity286 education system , the availability of jobs for @entity286 citizens , the worsening of an already strained criminal justice system , and a host of other controversial shifts in what @entity286 life looks like			0
the @entity45 has pined for a rewrite of @entity286 immigration law since day one of @entity24 's first term , but used all its political capital to get @entity130 passed – and never thought it would lose control of the @entity304 in 2010			1
as a result , the @entity24 administration had to rely on a bipartisan ' @entity308 ' senators last year to craft an immigration proposal that might , just maybe , be palatable to @entity45 republicans			1
the @entity3 bill passed , containing something for everyone : dramatically fewer deportations of illegal immigrants , increased border security and other political dog - whistles			2
but conservatives feared the @entity45 could n't be trusted to hold up its end of the bargain , and the proposal never got a vote in the @entity45			0
more walls : any immigration proposal a new @entity1 - led @entity5 might approve would be guaranteed to focus on border security instead of on mainstreaming illegal immigrants – as the @entity24 administration has sought @entity24 responded by unilaterally putting part of the bill into place with an executive order , guaranteeing that tens of thousands of people brought illegally to the @entity286 as children could stay – at least as long as he holds the @entity45			1
he has pledged to go further still after tuesday 's election			0
another government shutdown ? it 's possible @entity1 want to be in a position to stop him , but even in their rosiest scenario they wo n't take control until the new @entity5 takes office january 3			1
at that point they could use the power of the purse to deny @entity24 the money he needs to put his ideas into practice			0
but they have few weapons in the meantime , during the end - of - year ' lame duck ' session that 's likely to last a few weeks			0
one possibility is another threat of a government shutdown , since the last budget resolution @entity5 passed expires on december 11			2
@entity45 @entity1 leaders could hold that over the president 's head and threaten a budget standstill before @entity359 in order to force his hand			1
a new war of words would surely follow , with republicans calling the @entity45 lawless and @entity27 comparing the @entity1 to ill - mannered @entity366 , jeopardizing the postal service and @entity286 ' benefit checks during the busy holiday season			2
we 've seen this movie before			0
it usually ends with the @entity1 backing down since it has controlled only the @entity304 and ca n't take action without @entity27			0
this time could be different .			0

armed with majorities in both houses , a @entity1 - led @entity5 could embarrass president @entity24 into accepting changes to his health care law
the @entity1 could use a 1996 law to stop practically any regulation , at least until @entity24 vetoes a resolution and @entity1 give up on an override – and then for 30 days more
president 's hoped - for immigration reform law would be dead in the water and @entity1 could use their budget *axe* to *gut* his executive orders
an immediate funding *mechanism* to build the @entity17 oil pipeline could be on the table by *mid-january*
every @entity3 committee would be chaired by a @entity1 , changing the @entity45 's calculation on everything from foreign policy to @entity48 appointments
