by @entity0 a tourism boss has told of her dismay at the return of a real - life @entity4 to tv screens this summer			2
hapless @entity7 was the star of the series @entity10 , which showed his eccentric leadership of a hotel in @entity13 – the setting for @entity16 ’s legendary comedy character			1
his flamboyant and bizarre antics at the @entity18 were watched by an average of 2.8 million people when the fly - on - the - wall programme aired on @entity22 over three series			1
the re-emergence of @entity7 in a fourth series of @entity10 fills @entity26 , the chairman of @entity27 , with dread			1

@entity26 , the chief executive of the @entity37 and chairman of @entity27 said : ‘ i am personally disappointed to hear that @entity22 are making another series of @entity10 this summer in @entity13			1
‘ in my professional opinion i believe that the programme to date has portrayed @entity13 hotel standards in an unbalanced way which is unhelpful , particularly when @entity13 has just been voted the top seaside destination in the country by @entity47 ’s @entity46			1
@entity4 gives the car one last chance to start before he threatens to thrash it to within an inch of its life as @entity54 goes horribly wrong ‘ i have never believed in all publicity being good publicity			2
’ although @entity58 has confirmed it has signed the deal with @entity22 , the hotel ’s owners have been sworn to secrecy and declined to comment on the individual characters			1
manager @entity62 said : ‘ contracts were exchanged this week			2
we were n’t allowed to talk about it until then			2
‘ they are coming in july			0
i think they will be here for six weeks			0
’ you ca n't get the staff : @entity4 is exasperated by @entity70 , the @entity71 waiter who knows nothing how to win friends and influence people : @entity4 does his level best to amuse the @entity77 guests at his hotel he added : ‘ this will , hopefully , be good for business			0
anything that puts @entity82 on the map is good news			0
‘ the show will probably be screened next january , so we will hopefully get a boost early season next year			0
‘ we have already started to get more bookings since word got out			0
’ the @entity91 in @entity92 , the hotel which inspired @entity94			0
