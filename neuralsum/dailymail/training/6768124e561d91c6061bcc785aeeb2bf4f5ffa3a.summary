by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 11:28 est , 26 november 2012 when @entity2 visited the doctors with agonising back ache , she assumed she had developed a kidney infection			1
but just six hours later she was giving birth in hospital			0
unbeknown to the 24 - year - old nursery nurse , from @entity9 , @entity10 , already a mum to daughter @entity12 , she was five weeks overdue			2
@entity2 visited an out - of - hours medical centre suffering from back ache - only to be told she was pregnant			1
just hours later , @entity2 gave birth to @entity16 five weeks overdue , weighing 7lb 7oz ms @entity2 said she had not realised she was pregnant because she continued to have periods throughout her pregnancy and bizarrely had actually lost weight - dropping from a size 16 to a size 12 -14			1
she said : ' you read about women not realising they were pregnant and think ‘ how did you not know ? ’			2
i had no pram , no cot , nothing			0
' i ’d given it all away after @entity12 as was adamant we were n’t going to have another baby			0
' @entity2 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , felt pains in her back when she visited the park with her parter @entity34 and their two year - old daughter @entity12 in may this year			1
at first she thought her back ache was caused by a kidney infection and visited an out - of - hours medical centre for medication			0
ms @entity2 said she had not realised she was pregnant because she continued to have periods throughout her pregnancy and bizarrely , had actually lost weight but as she awaited the results of a routine urine test , a doctor asked her ' how far into your pregnancy are you ? ' she said she was n’t pregnant , but was sent to the @entity49 for a scan			1
she said : ' just after 6pm i was seeing a doctor and by 7.30pm i was at the maternity ward having a scan			0
' if they ’d said i was four months pregnant i could have got my head around that but they said ' it ’s good news , there ’s a baby there and you ’re 8cm dilated			1
' ' i could n’t believe it			0
my body went into shock and i started throwing up			0
i had periods throughout the pregnancy and in february was sick a couple of times so did a pregnancy test and it came back negative			0
there were just no further symptoms			0
' @entity16 was born weighing 7lb 7ozs with very dry , cracked skin			1
midwives told @entity2 when they ’d delivered her placenta it had stopped working			1
@entity2 said : ' they did n’t know what @entity16 had been surviving on and thought she was up to five weeks overdue			1
' she was back - to - back and they think tucked behind my pelvis which is why i was getting the back ache			0
' @entity12 has been brilliant with @entity16 , it ’s like she ’s always been here			2
' now six - months - old @entity16 has been diagnosed with severe @entity85 and @entity86 , commonly known as @entity85 ( @entity85 ) , causing her head to misshapen			2
while a baby ’s sleeping position is the main cause of mild @entity85 other causes include factors in the womb such as a lack of amniotic fluid and the position of the baby			0
@entity2 now has to raise £ 2,000 for a cranial helmet which will re-shape @entity16 ’s head and is also incurring costs for the family having to travel weekly to a clinic in @entity103 specialising in her condition			1
treatment for the condition is not available on the @entity107 as it is classed as a cosmetic problem			0
@entity2 said : ' it was n’t until i took @entity16 to the doctor that anyone showed any concern for the shape of her head but it was clear just to look at her it was flat			1
' we were referred to a consultant who told us @entity16 had @entity86 but because the condition is cosmetic there was little the @entity107 can do			2
@entity16 was born weighing 7lb 7ozs with very dry , cracked skin because her mother 's placenta had stopped working while in the womb ' you could see straight away her head was misshapen and we did n’t want @entity16 to have to grow up with this			1
children can be so cruel and i did n’t want that for my little girl			0
' i went to the hospital hoping they ’d help			0
if the @entity107 can fund boob jobs and gastric bands , why ca n’t they fund a child in need ? @entity85 occurs when a baby ’s soft skull bones are subjected to abnormal or prolonged pressure and the baby develops a misshapen head			0
while @entity86 refers to flatness at the sides of the head , @entity16 also has brachycephaly which is flatness at the back of the head			2
both conditions can cause changes to a baby ’s facial features such as ears and eyes not being aligned and , as with @entity16 , their forehead jutting out more than it normally would			1
@entity16 will have to wear the helmet 23 hours a day with the possibility of blisters on her head during the first seven weeks			2
@entity2 will need to travel to @entity103 every week at a cost of £ 116 a time for six weeks and then every fortnight after that so @entity16 ’s progress can be monitored .			1

@entity2 , 24 , had actually lost weight and had no idea she was pregnant
she was so far gone her placenta had stopped feeding baby @entity16
