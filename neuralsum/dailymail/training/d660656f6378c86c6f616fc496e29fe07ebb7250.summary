by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 09:22 est , 23 june 2013 @entity2 coffee chain @entity1 has finally paid corporation tax , for the first time since 2008			1
bowing to pressure from @entity7 and the public late last year @entity1 agreed to pay £ 20million in corporation tax by 2015 and the @entity8 has now received the first £ 5million , the company said today			1
the payment comes after the coffee chain faced a wave of protest late last year and was condemned by politicians for failing to pay corporation tax for almost every year since it began operating in @entity13 in 1998			1
@entity1 ’ chief financial officer @entity14 told the influential @entity15 last december that the coffee shop chain had made a loss for 14 of the last 15 years , achieving only a small profit in 2006			2
public outcry : @entity1 faced a wave of public protest over its failure to pay corporation tax in almost every one of the last 15 years but he and executives from other large corporations including @entity27 and @entity28 were branded ‘ immoral ’ by the committee ’s @entity30 chairman @entity29			1
@entity1 was revealed to have paid nothing in corporation tax between 2009 and 2012 , despite sales of £ 400million in 2011 , and had only paid £ 8.6million since it began trading in the @entity13			2
last year , @entity1 told investors its @entity36 businesses made a $ 40million ( £ 26million ) profit in 2011 , but accounts filed for its @entity13 , @entity40 , and @entity41 units , which make up 90 per cent of @entity36 revenues , showed a loss of $ 60 million ( £ 39million ) for the year to september 30 2012			1
this year however the @entity36 arm of the company has turned a profit			2
in its most recent trading update @entity1 said operating profit in @entity36 was $ 5.2million ( £ 3.4million ) for the three months to 25 april , up $ 12.2million ( £ 7.9million ) on an operating loss of $ 7million ( £ 4.5million ) for the same period a year earlier			1
a @entity1 spokeswoman said today : ‘ six months ago , we felt that our customers should not have to wait for us to become profitable before we started paying @entity13 corporation tax			1
‘ we listened to our customers in december and so decided to forgo certain deductions which would make us liable to pay £ 10 million in corporation tax this year and a further £ 10 million in 2014			1
‘ we have now paid £ 5 million and will pay the remaining £ 5 million later this year			0
‘ we are also undertaking measures to make @entity1 profitable in the @entity13 , such as relocating unprofitable stores to more cost effective locations , closing them where that is not possible and placing greater reliance on franchised and licensed stores			0
’ legal and fair : @entity1 ' chief financial officer @entity14 claimed late last year that the coffee shop chain was an ' extremely high taxpayer ' despite having paid no corporation tax since 2008 tax avoidance has become a major theme for the @entity68 as it has pursued a policy of austerity since coming to power three years ago			1
@entity71 has previously been criticised for lowering the top rate of income tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent and for imposing cuts to benefits payments while not doing enough to close tax loopholes			0
last week , prime minister @entity77 announced he had secured agreement with @entity13 's network of overseas territories and crown dependencies to sign up to a new global clampdown on tax evasion			0
tax , and the use of global tax havens , also formed one of the major themes of last @entity89 at @entity90 , @entity91			0
the first payment in corporation tax to be made by @entity1 for five years follows a fiery showdown with mps late last year			2
too little to latte : but mr @entity14 's claims drew a wave of fresh protests and led to consumers boycotting the coffee shop 's stores until @entity1 eventually agreed to pay £ 20million in corporation tax in december @entity1 insisted it was ‘ an extremely high taxpayer ’ globally and acted ‘ to an ethical ’ as well as a legal standard , despite declaring losses on its @entity13 operation			1
’ mr @entity14 blamed an over-aggressive entry to the @entity13 market for its failure to pay corporation tax claiming the strategy had left the coffee chain with expensive properties that did not make money			1
‘ it is fundamentally true , everything we are saying and everything we have said historically , ’ he told the committee while saying @entity1 remained committed to making profits here			0
he conceded a tax deal struck with the @entity123 authorities - that he declined to detail - was ‘ an attractive reason ’ for basing the coffee company 's operations there			0
however , it later emerged the deal saw around 6 per cent of @entity1 ’ @entity13 branch profits reduced to 4.7 per cent in what one mp called a ‘ cosmetic ’ deal with the @entity13 tax office , before being transferred to the @entity123 holding company as a dividend , meaning there was no profit to declare			2
@entity1 also charges a 20 per cent mark - up on coffee which it buys via @entity141 where it pays 12 per cent tax			2
‘ respectfully , i can assure you there is no tax avoidance here , ’ insisted mr @entity14 at the time			0
‘ we have a global tax rate of 33 per cent around the world			0
our tax rate outside the @entity2 is 21 per cent			0
that is higher than most multinationals ' global rate			0
we are an extremely high tax payer			0

@entity1 pays £ 5m in corporation tax for the first time since 2008
coffee chain promises to pay another £ 5m by end of the year
deal follows wave of public protest six months ago
last annual accounts show @entity1 ' @entity36 arm made a loss of £ 39million in 2012
but 2013 second quarter global net income rose 26 *%* to $ *390million* ( £ *253million* )
