prosecutors alleged that the @entity49 national deliberately placed her baby daughter into the chute with the intention of killing her			1

@entity59 , defending @entity33 , told the court that her client had been suffering from a post-natal psychosis - a severe form of post-natal depression			1
describing @entity33 , who came to the @entity66 from @entity49 in 2011 , as a competent and loving mother , @entity65 also argued that her illness meant she was not capable of ' forming an intent to either kill or cause really serious injury to her baby '			1
' i was extremely sad , ' she told jurors			0
' i went to the living room , i put the baby in a rubbish bag and i threw her away			1
' after i had done so , i just could n't believe what i had just done , and i could n't understand why i did it			0
' answering questions from ms @entity65 , @entity33 added that she had not ' planned ' to do what she did and had not thought about what she was going to do			2
' even now as i am speaking to you , i am still in a state of disbelief of what i have done			0
i have lost control of my thoughts when i did so			0
' i ca n't tell whether i was crying at the time or not , but i have done this			0
i was n't aware of what i was doing			0
if i thought that by doing so i would do some harm to the baby , i would n't have done it			2
' jailing @entity33 , judge mrs justice @entity107 said she accepted that the incident was not premeditated and that @entity33 was suffering from post-natal psychosis - a severe form of post-natal depression - at the time			1
she said : ' on september 2 last year you gave birth to your baby daughter			2
investigation : police tape gives residents in the block of flats that the chute is not to be used following the incident ' six days later you placed her in a black bin liner and you placed that bin liner in the rubbish chute and closed that chute			1
' she fell from the fifth floor			0
she sustained critical head injuries from which she will never fully recover			2
' you gave a false story to your husband and to the police about the baby being abducted			0
that story was obviously nonsense			0
' it 's quite clear that the jury were satisfied that you were suffering from postpartum psychosis ( severe post-natal depression ) at the time you acted			1
' anyone who sat through the whole trial will understand exactly how they came to that conclusion			0
' as you said yourself , you were her mother			0
you should have been her guardian			0
you will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life			1
' @entity33 was told she will serve half of her sentence in prison before serving the rest on licence			1
she showed no emotion as she was led down from the dock			0
prosecutor @entity154 said the baby girl suffered serious brain injuries and was likely to need intensive support from medical professionals			1
he also said it was unlikely she would be able to feed herself orally and that she was developing the signs of a severe form of cerebral palsy			0
@entity33 's barrister @entity59 told the court : ' when you describe this as an utterly tragic case , one can not be accused of exaggerating			2
' this was a life shattering event for this little family			0
' she ( the baby ) makes steady but slow medical progress			0
@entity174 ( @entity33 's husband ) has been constant in his attendance at the hospital and that 's where he stays now			2
' he 's not here but i know he will welcome her back with open arms			0
' @entity33 moved to the @entity66 to live in @entity23 , in the @entity183 , with her arranged marriage husband @entity185 , 32 , in august 2011			1
she told the jury she was happy in the marriage and she and her husband started trying for a baby as soon as she arrived in @entity66 before she eventually fell pregnant early in 2012			0
but days after giving birth , the court heard @entity33 suffered post natal depression			1
on the day she attacked the tot she also smashed up the @entity197 basket which she also lobbed down the rubbish chute			2
police released a shocking digital reconstruction of the baby 's fall which revealed it took just 2.2 seconds for the tot to fall from the fifth floor of the tower block to the ground			2
experts said the impact the baby suffered was the equivalent of her being in a car crash at 30mph without wearing a seat belt			2
the baby was found in a communal rubbish area on the ground floor by mr @entity185 wrapped in a headscarf - like material and surrounded by broken pieces of the tot 's moses basket .			2
