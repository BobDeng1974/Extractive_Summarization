by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 2 april 2013 pope @entity1 has made an emotional pilgrimage into the ancient necropolis beneath the @entity4 to visit the tomb of @entity6			1
the 76 - year - old is the first pontiff to tour the site , where pagans and early @entity10 were buried , since extensive archaeological excavations in 1965			2
the 45 - minute ' visit of devotion to the tomb of @entity6 ' was private , the @entity4 said , but it later released photographs and a video showing @entity1 walking through the streets of the city of the dead			1
the basilica was built over the location where early @entity10 would gather in secret , at a time of persecution in ancient @entity24 , to pray at an unmarked tomb believed to be that of @entity6 , the apostle @entity18 chose to lead his church			1
going underground : pope @entity1 in the necropolis beneath the @entity4 where he visited the tomb of @entity6 prayer : the @entity1 kneels before an altar in the main basilica after he concluded his visit to the necropolis the @entity4 first said @entity1 would pray at @entity6 's tomb , but later said he prayed instead in the basilica			1
the new pope ' paused in silent prayer , in profound and emotional meditation ' in the @entity41 in the vast basilica that is ' the closest place ( in the basilica ) to the tomb of the @entity46 , ' it said			0
during a tour of the necropolis conducted by its director and an @entity52 cardinal , the pope ' climbed up a bit , got closer to the place where the tomb of @entity6 lies , exactly under the central altar and the dome of the basilica , ' the @entity4 said			1
@entity1 walked down the entire main street of the ancient city of the dead , the statement said			1
the streets of the necropolis are similar to those of ancient @entity24 , only they are flanked by tombs instead of shops and apartments			1
the @entity4 said @entity1 walked to the necropolis entrance from the hotel on the @entity4 grounds where he lives , took the tour and later - after paying homage at the tombs of several popes in another underground level known as the grottoes , including @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 - strolled back to his residence			1
the underground excursion was a sharp departure from how popes in past years often spent the day after @entity84 , known in @entity52 as ' little @entity84			0
' those pontiffs would head to @entity86 , the @entity4 palace in the @entity87 , a short drive from @entity24			1
but that oasis of sprawling gardens and strolling paths in the quaint hill town is occupied by the predecessor of @entity1 , @entity94 , who spent the last hours of his papacy there before becoming the first pope in 600 years to retire			2
@entity94 is staying in @entity86 until a monastery at the @entity4 in @entity24 can be readied for him			2
unusual : the site was excavated in 1965 but no @entity1 since then has visited the tombs			1
the @entity4 said that the pilgrimage was private and ' a visit of devotion ' city of the dead : the necropolis resembles ancient @entity24 but instead of shops and houses , the streets are lined by tombs many @entity52 spend ' little @entity84 ' by having a picnic lunch in the countryside or in city parks , and @entity1 told @entity113 and tourists who gathered in @entity115 at noon monday to see him to ' have a good lunch			1
' @entity1 said he was praying that @entity84 would inspire the faithful so that ' hatred gives way to love , lies to truth , ' and that it would especially comfort those in ' most need of trust and hope			2
' he spoke to them from the studio window of the apartment in the @entity128 overlooking the square			0
@entity94 and popes before him lived there , but so far @entity1 , who stresses simplicity , has declined to move into the quarters			0
instead , he has continued to stay at the @entity4 hotel , where , as @entity136 archbishop , he stayed with fellow cardinals to elect @entity94 's successor			0
they chose him , @entity1 , the first pontiff from @entity140			2
@entity6 's mission was to continue to preach the message of @entity18 and reach more souls			1
@entity1 , as a @entity144 , is steeped in the evangelising mission of the church , and the necropolis tour brings him back to the origins of the church in its simplest years as a community of @entity10 professing their faith in defiance of the crackdown by @entity155 emperors			2
@entity6 himself was among the christian martyrs during @entity159 's reign			2
he is believed to have been crucified , head down , on the @entity4 hill			0
@entity84 blessing : @entity1 addresses the crowds in @entity115 on sunday			0
he is spending the week in @entity24 popular : the new pontiff has drawn huge crowds every time he has appeared in public since taking up the post last month @entity169 , the first @entity170 emperor , had an early basilica built on the slopes of the @entity173 , burying the pagan and @entity170 cemetery - necropolis means ` city of the dead ' - that surrounded @entity6 's burial site			1
the current basilica , named after @entity6 , was constructed over the earlier basilica that was deemed unsafe and demolished in the late 15th century			0
the @entity182 master architect @entity181 designed the bronze canopy over the central altar over the spot of @entity6 's burial site			1
the current basilica was planned as an awe - inspiring monument that would project the image of a powerful church			0
under popes of the last century , extensive excavations were carried out of the sprawling necropolis			0
in 1965 , archaeologists said they had found the bones of @entity6 in an area near an ancient @entity197 inscription saying ' @entity6 is here			0
' part of a nearby necropolis came to light in 2003 during construction of a parking lot			0
a few years ago , the @entity4 unveiled the largest and most luxurious of the pagan tombs under @entity204 - that of a family of former slaves			0
guided tours of the necropolis , upon appointment , have been one of the most sought - after attractions for tourists to the @entity4 .			0
