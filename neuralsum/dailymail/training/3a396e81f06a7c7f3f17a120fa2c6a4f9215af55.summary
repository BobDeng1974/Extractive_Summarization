but in a recent interview with @entity106 , @entity3 's father @entity104 said it was ' all money '			1
he told the channel : ' we had information that took us straight to @entity6 ... it was all money ... @entity112 had some big contracts he 'd put together worth millions			1
' @entity3 and @entity6 were in a similar line of business - according to @entity117 , @entity114 would often sell custom - made water fountains to @entity120 's more general garden business			1
investigators today said : ' @entity3 and @entity122 owned their own businesses , both related to waterfalls			1

' speaking at the conference , @entity126 , the district attorney for @entity127 , said : ' this is a cold and callous murder of an entire family			1

' i know he 's in a better place - i know that sounds a little trite but this gives our family a little more closure , the opportunity to heal and move forward and he 'll get what he 's got coming to him			1
' @entity145 , @entity80 's mother , added : ' my son and his family was a beautiful family that did not deserve this , @entity112 was so generous and kind to so many people - i always kept hope that we 'd find him			1
' ' ... that phonecall [ to say their bodies had been found ] was the biggest shock of our lives			2
but i still had hope because i felt the strength and power from this team [ of law enforcement officers ]			0
they did a wonderful job			0
defiant : last year in an exclusive @entity20 interview , @entity6 denied wrongdoing and hoped police would find the ' a * * * * * * s who did this ' ' now i received that phonecall , and now there 's a little more to our journey			1
i need justice from the law and the courts			2
' a year ago , their skeletons were found in the desert outside @entity64			1
the site was not far off heavily traveled @entity202 15 , which connects @entity50 and @entity204			0
investigators said there were no signs of forced entry at the family 's home or in their suv , which was found parked near the @entity214 - @entity213 border			1
neither @entity8 nor @entity215 had told family or friends they were leaving			1
when they were reported missing , authorities went to the house and found eggs that had rotted on the kitchen counter and two pet dogs in the backyard , indicating the family had n't prepared for an extended leave			1
nothing was missing from the home , and the couple 's credit cards and tens of thousands of dollars in bank accounts never were touched			2
last november , @entity122 was eulogizing the @entity3 family , he spoke with his ' best friend ' @entity3 multiple times a day and had an exciting business venture in the pipeline			1
now , almost a year later , he has been charged with murdering @entity120 , his wife and his two children , aged three and four years old			2
@entity6 , who said he took a lie detector test to remove himself from suspicion , spoke at length about the murdered family in an exclusive interview with @entity20 last year			1
speaking from a restaurant in the @entity94 , he called for the law to catch whoever is responsible , and claimed he himself was ' the least violent man on the planet			0
' in words which take on a chilling meaning after he was today charged with four counts of murder , he said : ' i was the last person @entity8 saw			1
' he then went on to describe a business meeting , and the last call from @entity3 's phone number - to him			1
@entity6 said : ' he came to @entity99 on february 4 to talk to me about a huge business deal we had going on in @entity259			2
‘ we met for an hour - and - a - half for lunch			0
we had the @entity259 project and a few other things going on			0
' the business had never been so good and we were looking forward to the future			0
he did nothing to suggest there was anything wrong or untoward			0
‘ we both left and went home and i spoke to him on the phone about two or three times on his drive back to @entity49 , all standard business stuff			0
the last time i spoke to him was around 6 o’clock			0
‘ it has been reported that i spoke to him in the evening , but that is n’t true			0
he did call me at 8.28pm , but i was watching a movie with my girlfriend , looked at the phone and decided not to answer			0
' when you talk to @entity8 it takes about half an hour , so i thought i ’d catch up with him in the morning			2
‘ i did n’t answer that call and i regret it to this day			0
’ @entity6 also responded to widespread accusations he was behind the killings - fueled in part by the revelation he had a criminal record and had served two jail sentences			2
he eventually agreed to a lie detector test in a bid to shake off suspicion			0
speaking of the crimes , he said : ' i regret it , but that does n't give people the right to trash me , especially after i have lost my best friend			0
‘ very soon after the disappearance , lt @entity301 who was leading the case , called me and asked if i would take a lie detector test , because he was convinced i knew where @entity8 was			1
‘ i declined at first and got some advice from an attorney , who told me not to do it , because if anything at all shows up they will harass you			0
‘ but i spoke to my girlfriend about it extensively and decided , you know what , i ’m just going to do the damn test , so they can forget about me and focus on something that might actually help find him			0
‘ about three of them came out to my attorney ’s office in @entity324			0
they asked me whether i knew anything about the disappearance , and if i did know anything , would i tell them			0
‘ after i ’d finished , @entity301 ’s partner said to me , " well there are a couple of inconsistencies " but that was just them trying to trick me into saying something			0
i did n’t hear any more about it after that			0
‘ was i a suspect ? well , i do n’t know if i ’m the only one they asked to do a lie detector test , but i am the only one who actually agreed			0
they were certainly on my case			0
' he said : ‘ i may not be the nicest person in the world , but i have only ever had @entity8 ’s best interests at heart			2
that ’s all i have ever cared about , despite what had been written about me			0
‘ i am a normal man , trying to take care of my three kids and i have lost a very good friend			0
' i was n’t @entity8 ’s best friend , but he was mine			2
i did n’t have many people close to me , but we shared a lot			0
