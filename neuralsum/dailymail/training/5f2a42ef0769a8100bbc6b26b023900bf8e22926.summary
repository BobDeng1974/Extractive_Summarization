by @entity0 a @entity2 judge who absolved sir @entity3 of wrongdoing in an ongoing fraud probe has labelled his response to the proceedings as dilatory and ignorant of the law			1
@entity9 made his stinging attack on the ageing actor in a lengthy court document explaining why he was eliminating him from his inquiry			1

before it was sold on they entertained stars including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 in the magnificent whitewashed villa mr @entity9 , who threatened the couple with international arrest warrants late last year after failing to get them to testify as suspects over the property deal , said the delays were no fault of the court			2
he said : ' although they may have harmed the progress of the case , it 's also true that if the suspects had observed the proper rules of conduct , namely a minimum level of cooperation with the judicial authorities , the fate of those suspects would have been clarified more than two years ago			2
' describing the delays as incomprehensible , he added : ' perhaps it would lead one to think that the idea was to protect or hide the acts or participation of the actor 's wife , something that only harmed sir @entity3 himself			1
' recalling reports around the time sir @entity3 was first named in the probe nearly three years ago that it had cost him a lucrative publicity contract , he claimed : ' such damage , if it existed , is largely down to the suspects ' own slackness , a slackness that could even be described as showing little respect towards the work of the @entity2 judicial system			1

mr @entity9 said it showed ' legal ignorance ' and described sir @entity3 's decision to wait until he and his wife were threatened with international arrest warrants to swear his affidavit as ' surprising to say the least			2
' he shelved his inquiry into the @entity44 after he denied any relationship with former corrupt mayors of @entity16 and a jailed ex-town planning chief			0
he also said he had sold his shares in a firm linked to the suspect land deal to his wife in the @entity3 's wife will now continue to be investigated on suspicion of fraud and planning and tax offences			0
she has not at this stage been formally accused or charged with any crime			0
