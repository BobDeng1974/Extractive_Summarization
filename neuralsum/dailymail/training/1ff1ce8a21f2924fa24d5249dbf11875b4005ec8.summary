the association has spent more than two years working on the design for the scarves , which come with a letter from five - time gold medallist sir @entity46 , encouraging people to ‘ wear it , wave it and help @entity114 with it ! ’ the @entity33 hopes to sell at least one million of the scarves , which some have described as looking like tea towels , in an attempt to mirror the success of the @entity120 – where 4.3m pairs of red mittens were sold , raising millions for the organising committee			0
@entity33 chief executive @entity124 said the scarves were vital for building support for the games			1

here is an item you can take to show you have gone out and supported the team			2
’ the scarves will be available online when and in @entity17 stores from may – but may not be on sale in any of the official @entity24 merchandise stores in @entity9 venues , due to a row between the @entity33 and @entity140 , which controls the shops			1
