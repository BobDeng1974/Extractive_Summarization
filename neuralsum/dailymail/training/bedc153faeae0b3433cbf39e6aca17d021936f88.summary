the island is believed to be one of the last places the @entity3 lived after teeth were discovered on its @entity11 cave ( pictured ) in 1910 @entity15 archaeologists have now found that a large portion of the site contains sediment dating to the last @entity25 , preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence			1
‘ in terms of the volume of sediment , archaeological richness and depth of time , there is nothing else like it known in the @entity15 , ’ said dr @entity28 of the @entity29 at @entity30 , who helped lead the research			2
‘ given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers , finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site			0

pictured is dr @entity51 retrieving dating samples from the rediscovered deposits at @entity54 in @entity5 the team dated sediments at the site using a technique called @entity59 stimulated @entity60 , which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight			1
the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old , indicating that @entity3 teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought			1
according to the researchers , they probably belonged to one of the last @entity3 to live in the region			2

‘ excavation in the future will provide us with the opportunity to subject the site to the wide range of approaches we use today in @entity115 archaeology and quaternary science , ’ he added			0
‘ for example we are hoping to be able to link our site with the broader @entity3 landscapes through study of similarly aged deposits around the island and , through bathymetric survey , on the seabed			0
’ ‘ we were sure from the outset that the deposits held some archaeological potential , but these dates indicate we have uncovered something exceptional , ’ explained dr @entity28			0
‘ we have a sequence of deposits which span the last 120,000 years still preserved at the site			0
crucially , this covers the period in which @entity3 populations apparently went “ extinct ” ’			0
it was during this period that @entity3 appear to have been replaced by our own species - homo sapiens			2
the project is set to continue exploration of the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years			0

in 1910 , *ancient* teeth were found in the @entity11 cave
team have now dated sediment where teeth were found using a technique which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight
results showed that the grains are between 100,000 and 47,000 years old - indicating that the @entity3 teeth are younger than first thought
overall it is thought the @entity5 cave has produced more @entity3 stone tools than the rest of @entity168 put together
