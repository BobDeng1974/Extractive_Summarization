’ shameful : @entity13 's refusal to admit what he had done led to @entity11 having to face him in the court , which she said ' felt like rape again ' her friend @entity18 , 55 , was inspired to join a crew on the 2013 @entity50 , raising cash to help the rape and @entity53 in @entity54			1

they became great friends , ' he said			0
' @entity62 kept her ordeal all to herself			0
she had a effervescent personality and extremely outgoing			0
we had no idea about what had happened to her			0
there was nothing at that would give you the impression she had suffered			0
' but in the year leading up to the trial she lost a lot of weight and had been into hospital			2
it is only afterwards that i realised she had attempted suicide			0
' she was incredibly brave			0
when you stand up to a man like that , and an institution like that , you must feel like you have the whole world against you			0
' this was very much in memory of @entity62 , and will hopefully help other victims of abuse			2
' there are a lot of vulnerable people out there who become victims			2
i hope this will bring some help and attention to their plight '			2
mr @entity18 has already raised £ 4,000 but hopes to raise even more cash for the ' inspirational ' woman			2
tough : @entity18 and the rest of the crew crossed the ocean in 18 days , where the boat was battered by six metre waves and had its front sail ripped moved : @entity18 said crossing the @entity8 ( pictured ) will hopefully do some good for those who have suffered sexual abuse or rape race : mr @entity18 joined a crew on the 2013 @entity50 , raising cash to help the rape and @entity53 in @entity54 disgraced choirmaster @entity13 , and his ex-wife @entity14 indecently assaulted former pupil @entity11 over a number of years			1

mrs @entity11 had also suffered abuse from the age of eight , she told the court , she was repeatedly raped by an uncle , her home life made worse by the death of her adoptive father , whom she dearly loved , at the age of 12			1
the following year she won a place at @entity135 ’s , where she fell into the clutches of @entity13 , a man with a predilection for his young , female pupils			2
at the age of 18 , his wife joined in the abuse , telling @entity11 that she ‘ owed her ’ as she indecently assaulted her			1
no doubt to dull the pain , the teenager drank and self - harmed			0
but that picture of the tormented young @entity11 is not one her loved - ones find easy to match with the successful , ebullient woman she became			2
however , the trial brought her pain back and she was unable to cope , but it is hoped she will inspire others to get help			2
@entity18 , whose boat was hit with six metre waves and its front sail ripped by force nine gales during the 18 day @entity8 crossing said it was worth it			1
he said : ' it was an opportunity to reflect on how lucky we were to know @entity62			0
