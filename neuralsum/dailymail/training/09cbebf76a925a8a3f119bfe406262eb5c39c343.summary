dozens of people gather on the pavement after the parked vehicle ( pictured ) blocks two trams from passing the group of passengers and bystanders then collectively lift the @entity3 off the tram tracks it is lifted and then pushed out of the way of the trams , much to the delight of stranded passengers trams could n't get around the parked vehicle , which was left sitting across the curb and sidewalk the woman then failed to return to the car despite hundreds of people gathering near it			1
a group of passengers eventually decided to lift and move the @entity3 off the tramlines and out of the way when she showed no sign of appearing 20 minutes later			1
