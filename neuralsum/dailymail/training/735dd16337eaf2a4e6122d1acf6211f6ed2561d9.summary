' i decided to do it because i was getting a lot of messages online asking me for signed picture , ' mrs @entity9 told @entity47			1
' i 'm just naturally business minded and decided it would make sense			2
' mrs @entity9 had started offering a picture free to buyers of her old clothes , which she had found when she cleared out her wardrobe after losing half a stone			1
but she said ' demand ' meant she had decided to sell just the photos on their own			2
she added : ' i chose it because i think it 's just a nice natural photo			0
it 's makeup - free and it 's not overtly provocative or sexual			0
i thought if people want it why not do it			0
' i 've had a lot of interest and did n't actually think it would be this popular			0
i 've suddenly realised it 's less than two weeks to @entity68 and i 'm going to be spending my time signing and sending out selfies			0
' mrs @entity9 said her husband did n't mind her selling the photo and was used to her taking a business - like attitude			1
mrs @entity9 has become known for posting a number of selfies , particularly charting her exercise regime but she said she feared she may need to order more pictures as she has already sold more than double the 200 she had printed			1
she also said she had decided to spray the photos with her favourite @entity41 scent , likening the idea to the scented love letters people used to post			2

mrs @entity9 has posted a number of cleavage baring selfies on her @entity98 account but said the pictures she has been sharing were ' not meant to be sexy ' after the councillor was accused of cheapening politics but the publicity has also come with its downsides			1
in august former conservative mp @entity104 described her as ' @entity106 's most embarrassing wife ' and claimed she was cheapening politics for constantly posting pictures of her cleavage			1

it 's where we are as a society			0
' it 's a way of taking the blankness out of life when people are often too standoffish			2
at the end of the day it is just a postcard			0
' a lady even said to me the other day it was " so nice for @entity16 to be associated with glamour			0

@entity9 , 31 , is selling signed pictures of herself for £ 10 on @entity13
the councillor said picture of her , showing her cleavage , will be scented
had *originally* listed selfies for free along with old clothes she was selling
but the wife of @entity127 mp said demand forced her to sell just the photo
she sold more than 400 in less than 24 hours and had 4,000 show interest
mrs @entity9 said selling photo made ' good business sense ' and was way of making life more *colourful* in a society where people are ' standoffish '
