@entity0 has poured scorn on the notion that swearing during a press briefing after the 1 - 0 friendly win against @entity5 last week was a sign of the pressure getting to him			1
the @entity10 manager has been in the spotlight ever since @entity10 ’s awful @entity13 display , in which they picked up just one point and scored twice , their worst performance at a @entity13 finals since 1950			1
it led him to use the words ‘ f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * ’ after the @entity5 game when he was asked if he was worried that statistics from the game showed @entity10 had two shots on target			1
@entity0 regularly berates the use of stats , considering them an unsophisticated reading of the subtleties of the game			1
and he laughed off the fact that he had sworn , admitting that he even does so in front of his wife			2
furious : @entity0 swore during a press conference after @entity10 's win over @entity5 ‘ that ’s ridiculous , ’ he said , when asked about his language			1
what sort of world are we living in ? you are scraping the bottom of a barrel to say something negative there			2
‘ listen , i ’m a football coach			0
i worked most of my life , up to the age of 25 , in @entity10			1
i played in @entity50 with dockers whose every other word was a swear word			0
they did n’t even know they were swearing because they did n’t know any other words			0
‘ if you say : “ we are very , very annoyed and morally offended by @entity0 , the @entity10 manager , using a swear word			1
and we insist that in the future he never swears , ” then , ok , i will never swear in your company again			0
‘ i just thought i was with people mature enough to understand that a swear word , which i thought was probably used at the right time , should not provoke a fit of moral indignation ... i was n’t arguing with anybody , i was making my points			2
is this the way to victory ? @entity0 takes his @entity10 side to @entity70 for their first @entity72 qualifier ‘ it was the same discussion about @entity10 ’s future , it was put in the same [ calm ] tone of voice			1
it was put strongly — yes , i ’ll accept that			0
i will put the message forward quite strongly , even a little bit aggressively , sometimes			0
‘ but there was no need for me to be upset by anybody and there was no ill feeling			0
i swear all the time			2
i swear in front of my wife			0
i never used to when i was a kid but i do now , so there you go			0
’ @entity0 says that his broader point in the exchange was that the young players he has at his disposal can cope with the pressure being placed on them to lift the gloom that has enveloped the national team ever since the @entity13 failure			1
‘ i do believe they can , without a shadow of a doubt , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ they ’re getting a baptism of fire , many of them are coming in very young and into an air of negativity			0
it ’s a bit of a baptism of fire			0
’ he added : ‘ it would be nice if the @entity70 game was n’t being built up into a @entity13 final			1
once they ’ve played with each other for a couple of years , had @entity122 experience with their clubs and played another 10 to 15 international matches , they will go into the @entity108 and that ’s when we ’d be hoping they could lift our heads a little bit out of this gloom			0
’ this way ! @entity10 must improve if they are to come away from @entity70 with three points on monday			1

@entity0 feels he swore at the right time after @entity10 beat @entity5
@entity10 manager believes youngsters can come into their own
feels @entity70 clash has been *wrongly* *billed* as @entity13 final
