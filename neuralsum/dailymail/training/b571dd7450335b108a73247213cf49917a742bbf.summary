after implementing the plan , the company told the agency that , even though they held 54,000 of ammonia at the plant , it was ' no ' risk of a fire or an explosion occurring there			1
the company said the ' worst possible scenario ... would be a 10 - minute release of ammonia gas that would or injure no one ' , an @entity11 report reveals			2
with their claim now proved tragically wrong , questions are emerging over exactly what caused the deadly blast - and what the owner , @entity34 , and his employees could have done to avoid it			1

' it felt like an extra loud sonic boom out in the country , ' the younger @entity34 said			1
' i had n't heard a sonic boom since i was a kid			0
about 30 seconds later , it dawned on me what it was			0
' he said his father is too distraught to talk and that neither of them understand what caused the initial fire as machinery is never left on			2
' everybody in town basically knows everybody , ' @entity34 said , his words soon dissolving into sobs			1
' it 's really rough			0
' proximity : inspectors noted how close the plant was to schools and homes but said it did not pose a danger			2
but in february the school was evacuated after staff noticed a fire at the plant a letter sent to parents of children at @entity113 , which is across the road from the @entity7 plant , reveals that the school was temporarily evacuated because of a ' concerning fire ' in february			1
' the evacuation was executed in calm , but serious fashion , ' it said			0
the letter noted that the school had not been notified ahead of time that the plant had been carrying out a controlled burn , so the principal had called 911			2

it noted the gas would be stored in two 12,000 gallon permanent storage tanks , and that staff would only fill the tanks to 85 per cent capacity denial : mr @entity34 's company had told federal safety agencies that there was ' no ' risk of a fire at the plant devastating : the family will be facing tough questions over what caused the fire - and as many as 15 deaths in subsequent reports , inspectors noted the proximity of the plant to schools and homes - without passing any judgment on the safety of this			1
' there are two schools located within 3000 ft of this facility , however , the impact potential is described by the region [ regional @entity127 office ] as low , ' a 2007 report noted			0
