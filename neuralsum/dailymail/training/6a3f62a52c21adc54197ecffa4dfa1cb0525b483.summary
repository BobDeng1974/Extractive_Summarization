by @entity0 published : 14:06 est , 11 november 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 12 november 2012 determined : home secretary @entity1 wants to reduce the ' pull factors ' blamed for attracting jobless migrants migrants from @entity5 and @entity6 could be barred from using @entity8 hospitals if they come to @entity9 without a job , @entity1 suggested yesterday			1
the home secretary admitted she would not be able to extend travel restrictions on the two countries when these expire at the end of next year			1
but she said she was determined to limit the so - called ‘ pull factors ’ blamed for drawing thousands of jobless migrants to the @entity9			1
@entity18 sources said officials were looking at restricting access to key public services for migrants who arrive here without a job			1
areas being looked at include healthcare , education , housing and benefits			1
detailed proposals will be published next year but enforcing any ban will be fraught with difficulties			0
the scheme has echoes of @entity36 ’s controversial ‘ @entity39 ’ law , which barred undocumented immigrants from using public services			0
the law was adopted in 1994 but abandoned five years later after it was ruled unconstitutional			0
mrs may told the @entity43 ’s @entity42 : ‘ i will be looking at the transitional controls on @entity5 and @entity6 at the end of 2013			0
' i will be looking at what we call the pull factors , what is it that attracts people sometimes to come over here to the @entity9 , so looking at issues about benefits , and access to the @entity58 , and things like that			1
’ ministers fear that a mass influx of immigrants from the two ex-communist regimes could derail the already difficult target of reducing net immigration to under 100,000 by 2015			0
@entity5 and @entity6 joined the @entity67 at the start of 2007 and remain its two poorest countries			2
transitional restrictions were imposed to prevent the kind of influx of migrants seen when @entity74 joined the @entity67			1
influx : ministers fear they will miss target for reducing immigration as a result , migrants from these two countries still require a work permit , and there are strict quotas on the number who can come to do low - skilled jobs			1
only people who have lived in the @entity9 for the past year can get free @entity8 treatment but a @entity91 investigation found that a third of 133 hospital trusts that replied to @entity95 requests made no checks			0
earlier this year an investigation by @entity99 magazine estimated that over the past three years health tourists had been given free hospital treatment worth £ 40million			0
mrs may also confirmed she was reviewing the wider question of free movement within the @entity67			0
controls : mrs may told @entity42 she is reviewing free movement in the @entity67 the @entity18 is in talks with other @entity67 countries about stopping illegal immigrants who enter into sham marriages with people in other @entity67 countries in order to be able to work and travel freely across the continent			1
mrs may insisted the government was still committed to its target of cutting net immigration from well over 200,000 a year to under 100,000			0
‘ that is still our aim , that we will get net migration down to the tens of thousands , ’ she said			2
‘ in the last figures , which were to the end of last december , we saw 30,000 fewer net migrants – the first significant fall for many years			2
’ @entity126 critics believe the target is unachievable without restrictions on migration from the @entity67			2
but senior @entity130 , including business secretary @entity131 , argue tight restrictions could damage the economy .			0

thousands of migrants could also be blocked from *claiming* benefits
but @entity1 admits she is *powerless* to extend restrictions on travel from the two *eastern* @entity141 countries
