an empty piece of land on the world - renowned @entity3 peninsula has gone on the market for £ 6.25million – more than the price of a 38 - bedroom castle in the @entity8			1
the muddy plot , the latest in the so - called @entity10 to go on the market , is now priced at £ 2m more than when it came with two houses			2
despite being empty , the plot is the same price as an entire estate on the south shore of @entity18 , @entity19 , which includes a castle , a swimming pool , 12 extra villas or bungalows , a sports hall , a golf course , a shooting range and an army assault course			1
if it sold at the asking price , the plot - which measures 27m by 18m - will equate to a staggering £ 1,161 per square foot			1
the reason that the sliver of land is set to fetch such an eye - watering sum is because it backs onto the beach and is located on the narrowest part of the peninsula , meaning that it boasts two - way views , including over @entity63			2
a property two doors down holds the record for the most expensive house on the peninsula per square foot			1
the detached house sold last year for £ 3.45million , which worked out as £ 1,725 per square foot			1
@entity3 is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 - to buy property and counts @entity78 and his son @entity79 among its residents			1
prices in the area have soared in the past few years , with prospective buyers even able to get more for their money in the exclusive @entity74 neighbourhood of @entity87			2
at the moment , £ 6.75million could give buyers a two - bedroom flat , within spitting distance of @entity92			1
the latest plot in the exclusive resort has gone on the market after the owner decided to stay put in the house he currently rents			2
the owner initially bought the land , which included two 1960s houses , with the intention of building his dream home in their place			1
but while the planning application was being considered , he fell in love with the property he was living in and decided to remain there			2
he went ahead with knocking down the two houses on the @entity3 plot , later securing permission for two four - bed houses , complete with their own gym and swimming pool			1
the planning permission stipulates that the twin properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively and would be set over four floors with a terrace running all the way around			1
but whoever buys the land could face spending an additional £ 1million on building the new homes			2
when the existing owner bought the property , it consisted of two houses ( pictured ) which he knocked down to make way for his dream home the site , situated in the sought - after resort of @entity3 , backs onto the beach and boasts two - way views , including over @entity63 whoever buys the plot will face spending about £ 1m each on building the two new homes , which will be four - storey and four - bedroom the owner intended to build his dream home on the plot but decided to stay in his current property , despite obtaining planning permission the properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively , set over four floors with a terrace running all the way round to enjoy the views @entity3 is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 - to buy property the prospective buyer will also count @entity78 among their neighbours			1
the @entity156 manager bought his ultra-modern property with his wife @entity158 for £ 3million in 2001 and commutes daily from his waterfront home to @entity156 's @entity74 - based ground @entity160			1
troubled footballer @entity162 also reportedly moved to the exclusive resort earlier this year , where he is said to be renting a flash penthouse apartment			0
other notable residents include a number of well - known names in football such as @entity170 manager @entity169 , former player and manager @entity172 , and mr @entity78 's son @entity79			0
computer magnate sir @entity174 also has a home there			0
@entity178 , of tailor made estate agents which is selling the empty plot , said : ' this is one of the few plots left along that section , most of the houses have now been replaced with new properties			2
' a lot of those have been turned into apartments so they 're unlikely to change again			0
a property in that particular area , two doors down from this one , holds the record for cost of a house per square foot			1
' one of the reasons why the properties on that section go for so much is because of the two - way views			0
historically that section has always been sought - after and the most expensive			0
every home in the @entity3 community ( pictured from above ) is within just a few minutes ' walk of the beach , with most enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the @entity209 the property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years , with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting - edge new properties to meet demand ( pictured ) ' on the peninsula the houses are much larger , 13 - 14,000 sq ft , they will change hands for £ 8million , but this bit is the narrowest part of @entity3 so the houses there can only be about 4 - 5,000 sq ft. ' he added : ' generally they are second homes on that stretch but we are seeing a change in fashion			1
historically everybody wanted large homes but we are seeing more people very happy to live in something smaller and easier to manage			0
' a lot of people are using them as their main home in the @entity236 but then also have another home in @entity238 , @entity239 or @entity240			0
it means they do n't have a huge maintenance bill when they 're away			0
' in that area people are only going to move when they pass away , because where do you move from there ? you 've got a nice plot , with two - way views , waves crashing on the beach - it 's a great place to live			2
' the empty plot is more than the price of an entire estate on the south shore of @entity18 , @entity19 , which includes a 38 - bedroom castle the £ 6m estate , which has this view , includes a swimming pool , 12 extra villas or bungalows , a sports hall , a golf course and a shooting range located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of @entity63 in @entity267 , @entity3 - nicknamed ' @entity236 's @entity268 ' - is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of its sought - after property			1
by area , @entity3 and surrounding @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the @entity236 's largest concentration of expensive properties outside @entity74			1
@entity3 's popularity is attributed to its seclusion , and every home in the community is within just a few minutes ' walk of the beach , with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the @entity209			0
houses were first built on @entity3 in the late 19th century , but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built - up , turning into a @entity10 filled with luxury beachfront mansions			1
the property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years , with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting - edge new properties to meet demand			2
in july 2009 a 14,990 sq ft ( 1,393 - square - metre ) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £ 13.5million – the equivalent of nearly £ 10,000 per square metre			1
in may , a bungalow bought for just £ 1,000 almost a century ago ( around £ 40,000 in today 's money ) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £ 5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value			2
earlier this year a tatty 1950s three - bedroom @entity3 bungalow which would be worth just £ 200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye - watering £ 2.25million			1
prospective buyers could even get more for their money in @entity87 , where £ 6.75m could buy you this two - bedroom flat in march , an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £ 3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down			1
last year , 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £ 80million as @entity3 ' reputation has continued to grow			0
mr @entity178 added : ' the land is worth more without the old houses on it because it 's all about the potential use of the land			0
' generally you can get more square footage in a modern build than you could just ten years ago			0
properties now can build one or two floors higher so you get a larger house and a more popular layout			0
' most of the older properties are only two storeys and generally do n't take full advantage of the two - way view			0
construction now with no pillars or internal walls means you can sit in your kitchen and look both ways with no obstruction			0
you just ca n't get that in a 1970s build			0
' the key thing that drives the value is we 're surrounded by water			0
what you have got in @entity3 is all you have , it 's not like a rural place where you can expand and build a new village			0
and the more popular it becomes the more in demand plots like this are			0
if you want to be here you have to pay the money and people selling know that			0
