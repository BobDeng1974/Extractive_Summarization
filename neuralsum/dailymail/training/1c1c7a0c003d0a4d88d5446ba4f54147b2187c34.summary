warning : the @entity0 has confirmed a acrylamide , which is found in coffee , is a cancer risk a chemical found in coffee , chips , burned toast , crisps , crackers and certain types of baby food has been confirmed as a cancer risk by @entity14 food watchdogs			1
the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) said children are most exposed to the chemical , which is called acrylamide and forms when roasting , frying and browning food			1
health authorities in @entity23 and @entity14 have long been aware of the concerns about the chemical and @entity0 was asked to establish the scale of the problem and the risk			2
it has now published a consultation paper , which warns : ‘ @entity0 has confirmed previous evaluations that , based on animal studies , acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups			1
‘ coffee , fried potato products , biscuits , crackers and crisp breads , soft bread and certain baby foods are important dietary sources of acrylamide			1
on a body weight basis , children are the most exposed age groups			2
’ the organisation suggests it may be necessary to establish new legal controls for the food industry to try and reduce the levels found in products sold in restaurants and supermarkets			1
the watchdog said it may also be necessary to issue new advice to home cooks to help them cut levels of the chemical in home cooked meals			0
food manufacturers in @entity23 have been under pressure to change their cooking methods and recipes in order to reduce the levels of acrylamide formed during cooking			1
despite this , the chemical remains at high levels in some products , while acrylamide is also created in the home during roasting and frying			1
a study published by @entity23 ’s @entity82 ( @entity82 ) last year found raised levels of the cancer risk chemical have been found in big brand foods from fries sold by @entity87 to crisps , ginger biscuits and even healthy breakfast cereals			1
the chair of an @entity0 panel set up to examine acrylamide , dr @entity94 , said : ‘ acrylamide consumed orally is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract , distributed to all organs and extensively metabolised			1
‘ @entity98 , one of the main metabolites from this process , is the most likely cause of the gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies			0
’ however , dr @entity94 , who is head of chemical risk at the @entity82 , pointed out that the evidence of harm to humans has , so far , only ‘ provided limited and inconsistent evidence of increased risk of developing cancer ’			0
the panel has recommended the need for new research involving humans			0
it also wants surveys to give a better picture of acrylamide levels in food cooked and eaten in the home			1
dangers : the watchdog confirmed children were most exposed to the chemical , which is also found in chips @entity0 said : ‘ once finalised , @entity0 ’s scientific advice will support @entity14 and national decision - makers to consider possible measures to further reduce consumer exposure to this substance in food			1
‘ these may include , for example , advice on eating habits and home - cooking , or controls on commercial food production			2
’ in the past , there have been higher levels of the chemical in certain children ’ s biscuits , but not in the rusks given to the very young			0
the @entity23 ’s @entity82 has been carrying out regular surveys of high street food to measure acrylamide levels			1
the last survey , published in april 2013 , found raised levels in 14 products			1
the biggest problem was with crisps , including a number of expensive brands such as @entity158 crisps			0
the @entity23 's @entity82 has highlighted high levels of acrylamide in @entity161 there were also raised levels in @entity165 ready salted crisps , @entity167 cheese and onion crisps , @entity170 crisps , @entity173 @entity172 sea salt crisps and the co-op ’s @entity174 and chardonnay wine vinegar crisps			0
manufacturers suggested the problem was caused by the bad weather during the growing season of 2012 which changed the sugar levels in the potatoes thus creating more acrylamide during frying			2
in terms of take - out food , raised levels were found in a sample of @entity87 fries bought at a fast food restaurant in @entity191 , @entity192 , and a fish and chip shop in the same town			2
breakfast cereals are promoted as a healthy start to the day			0
however , those containing bran , which is cooked at a particularly high temperature , can contain more acrylamide			0
raised levels were found in @entity202 flakes , @entity205 ’s @entity204 bran flakes , the co-op ’s wheat bran flakes and @entity209 wheat sold under the @entity211 name			2
higher than expected levels were also found in @entity214 ’s @entity213 and @entity216 biscuits			0
the @entity82 stresses that it does not consider the levels of the chemical found in the products to be dangerous , however it is keen that they are brought down as a precautionary measure			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity82 will work with the relevant local authority to encourage food manufacturers to review their acrylamide reduction strategies			0
’ the watchdog says there is no need for the public to give up the foods named in its survey , however it does publish advice on how people can reduce exposure			0
this includes cooking chips only to a light golden colour while advising that ‘ bread should be toasted to the lightest colour acceptable ’			0
it said manufacturers ’ instructions for frying or oven - heating foods , such as chips , should be followed carefully .			0

@entity0 say children are most exposed to acrylamide , which forms when food is roasted , fried or browned
organisation has suggested legal controls on the food industry
would try and reduce the levels found in products sold to the public
