by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 14:15 est , 24 may 2012 a man has reportedly claimed he lured six - year - old @entity2 with candy , before stabbing him to death and chopping up his body - nearly 33 years after the boy vanished as he walked to the bus from his @entity9 home			1
@entity10 , who worked as a shopkeeper and lived just blocks from @entity12 at the time of the boy 's disappearance , reportedly told police he dumped the youngster 's remains in the garbage			1
investigators swooped on him in @entity21 , @entity22 on wednesday evening after a relative tipped off police that @entity10 had admitted to killing a boy shortly after @entity12 vanished			1
missing : six - year - old @entity2 vanished on the way to the school bus in 1979 and has never been found			2
police have questioned a man who claims he stabbed the boy and dumped his body the relative only called police after investigators excavated the basement of @entity33 , a handyman who had known @entity12 , in search for evidence last month			1
police commissioner @entity37 said in a statement on thursday that the man ' has made statements to @entity42 detectives implicating himself in the disappearance and death of @entity2 33 years ago ' commissioner @entity37 added that further details would be released later today			1
according to a source speaking to the @entity47 , @entity10 told investigators he had enticed the boy with sweets , stabbed him , cut up his body and put him in plastic bags			1
but in a conflicting report from @entity54 , another source said @entity10 claimed he suffocated the boy and left the body in a box in a @entity9 alleyway			2
after moving to @entity22 shortly after , @entity10 told family members he had killed a boy but did not mention his name , sources said			2
he also told a spiritual adviser in the 1980s about killing a child			0
the confession led a relative to call police after the high - profile search of @entity33 's @entity70 basement			1
unsolved : @entity2 vanished on the way to the school bus in @entity70 , @entity73 in may 1978 police told @entity75 they have no hard evidence to support the confession			1
but if true , the claims - which come almost exactly 33 years after @entity12 vanished - could solve a case that shocked @entity80 and raised awareness of the plight of missing children across the country			1
it will also bring closure to @entity12 's parents , @entity88 and @entity89 , who have not moved from their @entity70 home since his disappearance in the hope that he will someday return			1
the revelations come a day short of the anniversary of his disappearance ; he was last seen on may 25 , 1979 as he walked to the bus stop - the first time his parents had let him go alone			2
it sparked an international manhunt and he became the first child whose ' missing ' photo appeared on the side of a milk carton			0
may 25 is now @entity105			0
he was officially declared dead in 2001			0
in may 2010 , the @entity9 district attorney ’s office said they were taking a fresh look at the decades - old case of the missing six - year - old			0
questions : in the 1980s , @entity112 , right , was identified as a prime suspect but no hard evidence has ever linked him to the crime			0
last month , police searched the basement of handyman @entity33 , left search : in april , police swooped on @entity33 's basement - under the blue tarp - in a renewed search for evidence just weeks ago , police launched an intensive search for the missing boy when they dug up the basement workshop of @entity33 , who knew the six - year - old from the area			1
@entity33 , now 75 , was questioned several times by police after his ex-wife told them about the alleged rape of his niece			2
he ' sky rocketed to the top of the list ' of suspects after the claims , police said			0
the missing boy 's mother , @entity137 , was also said to have told agents to look again at the handyman , who befriended @entity12 before he vanished and hired @entity112 to do odd jobs for him			1
concrete had been laid over the foundation of the basement shortly after the youngster vanished - but the search did not yield any new evidence			2
when authorities told @entity33 cadaver dogs picked up the scent of human remains at his basement he allegedly blurted out : ' what if the body was moved ? ' in light of the claims by @entity10 , @entity157 , @entity33 's lawyer , told the @entity47 he ' has said all along that @entity33 had nothing to do with the case '			1
renewed search : the @entity162 searched the basement belonging to @entity33 , a handyman who knew @entity12 from the area , after his ex-wife claimed he had raped his niece			1
the search yielded no new evidence hope : investigators sent off concrete , which was laid down shortly after @entity12 's disappearance , for analysis ' [ @entity33 ] has nothing to do with this latest suspect , that i know of , ' @entity157 added			1
while no one has ever been arrested or charged with @entity12 's disappearance , @entity112 - a drifter whose girlfriend was the boy 's babysitter - was identified as a prime suspect in 1985			1
jailed for an unrelated crime , @entity112 , 68 , later told a prison cell mate he knew every stop of the bus route that took @entity12 to school and knew the six - year - old got off at the third stop			1
he admitted to taking a boy back to his apartment to rape him on the day @entity12 disappeared , but he said he let the boy go			1
he said he was ' 90 per cent sure ' it was the same boy he later saw on tv			0
no hard evidence has linked him to the crime			0
he is now in a @entity196 jail on a 20 - year sentence for abusing two boys and is due to be released in november			0
@entity12 's father has previously said : ' @entity200 is the man who abducted my child			1
we lost our child to a pedophile , and that 's not comprehensible			0
' pain : @entity208 , @entity12 's father , watched over the search from the family 's home half a block away grief : @entity137 watches the search for clues to her son 's disappearance in april from her window family : after the disappearance in 1979 , @entity137 , left , appeared on a number of tv shows to try to find her son			2
@entity224 , @entity225 , holds a photo of @entity12 as he poses with his other son @entity227 along with @entity12 's mother @entity88 , @entity208 watched over the search in april from their apartment just half a block away			2
they have never moved from their home , in the hope their son would one day find his way back			0
nor have they changed their phone number , as @entity12 knew it off by heart			0
his father said another reason they did not want to move was because of their other two children , @entity246 , who was eight at the time of the disappearance , and @entity227 , two			0
@entity89 and @entity137 have continued to fight for a legal resolution to their son ’s death			0
in 2000 they spoke with @entity254 's 60 minutes about their refusal to give up hope			0
@entity137 said at the time : ' we have his belongings all over the house			0
to put them away , it seems to us and to our children that he 's gone and he 's not coming back			0
' convinced that @entity112 is guilty of the crime , @entity225 sends him a copy of the missing child poster twice a year with the words ' what have you done with my little boy ' written on the back			0
police said they expect to provide further details on the new developments later today			0
@entity12 ’s disappearance came before a time when the faces of missing children would peer out from milk cartons and tv movies explored a seeming epidemic of vanishing children			1
the only small comfort his parents ever received from their son 's abduction was knowing that it had become the catalyst in the search for missing children			2
his disappearance prompted such an extensive search that by 1985 , it had taken in the whole of @entity80 , parts of @entity294 and even reached @entity298			0
may 25 , the day @entity12 disappeared , is @entity105 , which was named by president @entity299 in 1983 in honor of the missing six - year - old			1
an entire network for tracking missing children emerged since then , including @entity304 and pictures on milk cartons - @entity12 's was the first picture of a missing child to ever be put on a milk carton			1
after 30 years the case is still officially open and the world has never forgotten the face of the blue - eyed , blond - haired boy who captivated a nation			0
each administration since @entity299 has honored the annual reminder to the nation to renew efforts to reunite missing children with their families and make child protection a national priority			2
on the day he disappeared , the school noted @entity12 's absence but did not notify his parents			1
it was n't until 3.30pm his mother @entity88 realized he was missing and called police			0
his father @entity328 , a professional photographer , dispatched black - and - white photographs of @entity12 in an effort to find him			2
the massive search and media attention that followed focused the nation ’s attention on the problem of child abduction and lack of plans to address it after it became apparent there was no coordinated effort between federal , state , and local law enforcement , no national response system in place and no central resource to help searching families			0
@entity12 's parents have since become outspoken advocates for missing children			1
for years , they refused to change their phone number , in the hope that @entity12 was alive somewhere , and might call			2
they never moved in the hope he would return home .			0

@entity10 lived just blocks from @entity12 when he disappeared
told investigators he thew @entity12 's body parts into garbage after slaying
police tipped off by relative who said @entity10 had confessed to the crime
comes just weeks after the four - day excavation of handyman @entity33 's @entity70 basement , where police found no new evidence
revelations come nearly 33 years to the day since @entity12 disappeared - and could solve one of the country 's most enduring missing children cases
