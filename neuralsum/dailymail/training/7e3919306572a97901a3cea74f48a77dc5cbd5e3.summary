' she added that when @entity38 is awake in the hospital , she screams uncontrollably - terrified the man will find her and drag her away			1

career : @entity10 ( right ) has appeared in several films , including the 2010 movie @entity118 , pictured speaking today , ms @entity8 said she believes the employee may have been working with the sex offender as the two were friends			1
' i do n't know what their motive was or if it was a money thing , ' she said			2
' but my daughter is very petite and young looking and i believe one of the men is a registered pedophile , so perhaps that was why he went after her			0
' she was very vulnerable			0
they singled her out and preyed on her			0
my daughter never touched hard drugs in her life			0
she was always a very demure and quiet girl			0
' the university professor said she is just glad @entity10 is still alive after a threatening email was sent to @entity10 's boyfriend last month saying he was going to kill both her and her mother			0
' i spent two weeks in @entity12 looking for her after that			1
i got no help from police who warned me victims are n't usually found alive after three months missing , ' she said			0
' it was only when i made a plea on @entity145 and then the media got hold of it that the police really started to investigate her disappearance			0
' sightings : @entity150 , who appeared in a handful of films , was seen 6500 block of @entity106 job : @entity10 was working at a @entity4 @entity105 when she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised , missing a term of school			0
her mother said that is where her problems began police had considered her ' voluntarily missing ' - but her mother refused to believe it , saying that @entity10 was always in touch regularly			0

it will likely be a while before her daughter can even talk about what happened , she said			0
' i want to get my daughter back and give her the love and care she needs			0
the last four months have been a nightmare , i have n't been able to sleep or eat or work or even think			0
' once she is back to normal , i know @entity10 will go back to pursuing her dream			1
she will not give that up just because of what that man did to her			0
downfall : @entity161 mug shots from drug charges show @entity150 looking increasingly disheveled and ill she later posted a message calling for help on @entity145 , writing that her daughter ' has health issues risk to life , and previous torture by this man lead to suicidal ideas , and he forced drugs '			0
authorities have never divulged the nature of her health issues			0
on her @entity145 page , the concerned mother wrote : ' @entity10 is not voluntarily missing ; she has had no contact with not only family but friends throughout this occurrence			0
' she added : ' on the surface , she ’s an adult and can do whatever she wants			0
' but you start digging below the surface and you find these connections and you ca n’t ignore these connections			0
so where is she ? ' @entity210 : @entity10 was noted as ' voluntarily missing ' but her mother disputes this , saying they spoke every day			0
