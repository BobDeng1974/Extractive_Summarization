time to put the credit cards away because @entity2 's shot - off finger is not for sale after all			1
the former @entity5 slugger , and admitted doper , severed his left - hand middle finger last month when his handgun accidentally misfired at home while he was cleaning the firearm			1
doctors reattached the digit , but last week the 50 - year - old announced on @entity14 that the limb had fallen off and that he planned to sell it on @entity17 , along with his flashy gun			1
now he says the story about the finger falling off in the middle of a poker tournament was all part of an elaborate joke he devised after seeing a fake finger for sale in a @entity31 shop , @entity20 reports			1
so much for owning a piece of baseball history			0
he has since told @entity20 that the finger never fell off			0
pictured above with fiancée @entity39 ( right ) @entity2 had sports fans gearing up to start a bidding war last week when he wrote a series of prank tweets , saying he was going to sell his finger and gun			1
' i will soon put the finger that fell off in the poker tournament on @entity17 for sale , ' @entity2 tweeted monday night			1
' the @entity17 ad will read slightly used middle finger with 462 home runs could be used as a stirring straw for drinks , ' he joked			1
@entity55 went on to offer the finger as a package deal , with the 45 - caliber @entity59 gun that shot it off on october 29			1
however , there were signs that it was a joke then since firearms and human remains are not allowed to be sold on @entity17			1
@entity2 's lighthearted attitude about the painful injury is marked change from last month , when he broke down in tears about the incident to @entity71			2
describing what happened , he said : ' at first i heard it go off and i actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table			0
' ( @entity78 ) thought nothing had happened			0
then i look at my hand and my finger ’s blown off			2
' @entity2 explained the bullet only narrowly missed his fiancée , swimwear model @entity39 , who was standing nearby			2
she quickly ran to his aid			0
' i was telling @entity2 not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out , ' @entity39 told @entity71			2
accident : the former @entity5 star , who admitted to using performance - enhancing drugs during his long career , accidentally shot off his left - hand middle finger last month while cleaning his handgun at home in @entity94			1
pictured on the left in july 2013 , and on the right playing for the @entity96 in 1992 @entity39 wrapped his hand in a towel and called 911			0
' i ’m just glad nothing happened to her ( @entity39 ) , ' @entity2 said			0
' if it ’s a lesson having to lose a finger , so be it			0
' @entity39 said her fiancée had been at a shooting range a few days earlier			0
he then decided to clean the weapon but did n't realize it was still loaded			0
' the middle finger was hanging by a thread , and i wrapped his hand in a towel and then called 911 , ' @entity39 told the newspaper			1
' he blew away an artery and a big bone chunk			0
' the @entity113 dominated the @entity5 with his hitting prowess in the 1980s , but later admitted to using performance - enhancing drugs for much of his career			1
@entity2 is a right - handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six - time all - star			2
he also played for @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , the @entity124 and @entity125 during a career that spanned from 1985 to 2001			0
it could have been much worse : in an emotional interview last month , @entity2 described how the bullet almost hit his fiancée @entity130			2
the couple seen above in a picture posted to @entity130 's @entity133 on november 19			0
