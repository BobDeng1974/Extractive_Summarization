by @entity0 published : 16:18 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 22:16 est , 5 november 2012 when @entity2 was plunged into darkness last week during a blackout caused by @entity5 , the city streets became alien and frightening to most residents			2
but as these eerie yet now familiar - looking photographs show , it is not the first time that the city has been left to find its way in the dark			0
in the summer of 1959 , @entity2 suffered a similar blackout - although the consequences were far less devastating that those wreaked by @entity5			0
on august 31 that year , a 500 - block radius around @entity17 in @entity18 suffered a black - out - believed to have been caused because the grid could not cope with so many people using increasingly popular refrigerators and air conditioners in a heatwave			1
the power was cut just as night fell , leaving @entity2 to do their best to make their way to cafes and bars where people crowded around candles as shown in the atmospheric but gloomy photographs taken by @entity33 nearly half a century ago			1
@entity34 goes dark : on august 31 , 1959 , a 500 - block radius around @entity17 in @entity18 suffered a black - out dining in the dark : @entity2 make do in an improvised meal at a diner during the summer heatwave after power went out in their apartments gloomy : the summer blackout , which lasted for 13 hours , was believed to have been caused when the circuit overloaded due to the increasing popularity of refrigerators and @entity46 the pictures are strikingly familiar to those taken in the aftermath of @entity5 as residents huddled together , shared food and warmth and helped each other through until daybreak			1
reassuringly some things have n't changed - police reported very little crime during the 1959 blackout , a statement echoed by the @entity60 in 2012			0
fortunately for @entity2 back then , their power cut lasted just 13 hours			1
the aftermath of @entity5 was far more devastating			0
the ferocious storm killed at least 113 people and two million remain without power as the bitter november cold sets in			2
last week , the lower half of @entity18 was almost in complete darkness after power was cut off when an electrical substation blew up due to surging flood waters in the @entity72			0
although the situation has vastly improved on the island , about 1.9million homes and businesses remained in the dark for the seventh night in devastated communities up and down the @entity79 - with @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and parts of @entity84 some of the worst hit			0
