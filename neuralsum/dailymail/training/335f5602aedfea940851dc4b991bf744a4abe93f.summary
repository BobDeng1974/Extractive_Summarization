they had been back on @entity1 for a matter of hours			1
but that was no excuse for three @entity5 astronauts were who whipped into some colourful traditional @entity8 costumes for a press conference today after their @entity11 spacecraft landed in the country			1
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity16 @entity15 had been in space for 163 days before jettisoning their capsule from the space station this morning			1
they were dragged form their capsule and were soon this afternoon , @entity23 tweeted : ' soyuz capsule lands safely at 7:45 am edt on the steppe of @entity8			1
all 3 crew members are safe and adjusting to gravity			1
eight search - and - rescue helicopters circled the landing site to ensure a speedy recovery			2
@entity13 , in the capsule 's central seat , was the first to be hauled out and hoisted into a reclining chair			2
while medical personnel mopped his brow and checked his vital signs , the astronaut smiled broadly and chatted with his colleagues			2
@entity14 , and then a heartily laughing @entity15 , went through the same procedure a few minutes later			2
one of the locals : @entity16 astronaut @entity15 , wearing a traditional @entity8 costume , attends a press conference in @entity8 they came from outer space : the three astronauts pose for the cameras grounded : @entity16 astronaut @entity15 ( left ) , @entity35 cosmonauts @entity13 ( centre ) and @entity14 ( right ) rest shortly after the landing high flyers : the three astronauts have been on board the @entity85 for 163 days speaking from the touchdown site , @entity23 spokesman @entity86 called it ' a bullseye landing '			1
' the spacecraft landed almost exactly where it was forecast to , ' he told @entity23 television			2
earlier @entity93 showed footage today of the departing crew saying their farewells to the three astronauts left behind before being shut into their cramped capsule			2
' although i will miss this place and this crew , i also am very happy to return home to my family , ' @entity15 said			2
' it is time for @entity44 to step aside and make way for @entity106			0
' the capsule undocked and began a slow , gentle drift away from the space station as scheduled at 0818 gmt. its landing was aided by the deployment of several parachutes , which slowed its descent			0
three small engines also fired to soften the landing			0
happy days : @entity118 ( left ) @entity119 ( right ) and @entity14 on board the @entity85 @entity121 away ! this @entity23 graphics shows how the @entity11 craft separated from the @entity85 gently does it : the @entity11 craft was slowed down by thrusters and three parachutes the @entity37 spacecraft is composed of three elements attached end - to - end - the @entity129 , the @entity130 and the instrumentation / propulsion module			1
the crew occupies the central element , the @entity130			0
the other two modules are jettisoned prior to re-entry			0
they burn up in the atmosphere , so only the @entity130 returns to @entity1			0
the @entity129 provided the crew with extra living space during the two - day trip to the @entity5			0
it contains systems vital to rendezvous and docking with the @entity5 's @entity143 or other port - a docking mechanism , a hatch and rendezvous antennas			0
having shed two - thirds of its mass , the @entity11 reached ' @entity150 ' - a point 400,000 feet above the @entity1 , where friction due to the thickening atmosphere heated its outer surfaces - three hours after undocking			1
with only 23 minutes left before it landed on the grassy plains of central @entity157 , attention in the module would have turned to slowing its rate of descent			0
eight minutes later , the spacecraft streaked through the sky at a rate of 755 feet per second ( 514mph )			0
before it touched down , its speed slowed to only five feet per second ( 3mph ) , and it landed at an even lower speed than that			1
as the @entity11 made its gradual descent , one unidentified ground control staff member remarked that ' @entity14 ( @entity14 ) must be real hungry right now ' and that he would be looking forward to ' soup and some meat '			1
the retirement of the @entity16 shuttle fleet has left @entity35 's @entity11 spacecraft as the only means to deliver crews to the space outpost			1
@entity35 cosmonaut @entity180 has now taken over as commander of the space station and will stay until july together with @entity93 astronaut @entity183 and @entity185 's @entity184			0
they will now prepare for the arrival of first commercial cargo shipment to the space station in early may			0
the @entity190 , better known as @entity190 , launches its @entity191 from @entity192 on april 30 , and the capsule will take a few days to get to the space station			0
it will be the first time a private company has launched space station supplies			0
the space station will then return to its standard six - person crew with the arrival of @entity93 astronaut @entity199 and @entity35 colleagues @entity200 and @entity202 , who will blast off from the @entity203 in @entity8 on may 17			1
the @entity204 seen at the launch pad after being raised into vertical position on november 11 , 2011 at the @entity203 in @entity8			1

their @entity11 craft touched down on the steppes of @entity8
