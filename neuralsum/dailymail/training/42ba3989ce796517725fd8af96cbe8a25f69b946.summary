from their perch 200 miles above @entity2 , astronauts have sent thousands of incredible images of our planet glittering with lights			1
but what we usually do n’t see is the high - tech ‘ office ’ within the @entity10 from which these stunning photos are captured			0
now @entity12 has released a spectacular image of the @entity14 – a module that provides panoramic views of @entity2 and houses one of the space station 's two robotic work stations			1
the large bay windows allows the @entity26 crew to see outside			1
the @entity14 houses one of the space station 's two robotic work stations used by astronauts to manipulate the large robotic arm seen through the right window these robotic work stations are used by astronauts to manipulate the large robotic arm seen through the right window			1
the robotic arm , or @entity34 , was used throughout the construction of the station and is still used to grapple visiting cargo vehicles and assist astronauts during spacewalks			1
the image , taken on january 4th , shows the @entity14 ’s large bay windows which allow the @entity26 crew to see outside , providing them with a full panoramic view of @entity2			1
it is a pressurised observation and work area that accommodates command and control workstations and other hardware			2
most images on the @entity10 are taken in the cupola , where there are often as up to eight cameras set up with different lenses			2
at times , astronauts compete with each other for the best position from the @entity10 200 miles ( 320km ) above @entity2 , astronauts have sent thousands of incredible images of our planet glittering with lights at any time , crew members in the @entity14 can communicate with other crew members , either in another part of the station or outside during spacewalk activities			1
@entity64 , one of @entity12 's most prolific astronaut photographers , has spent large amounts of his time in the @entity14 , trying to get the best shot of @entity2			1

' say a volcano 's going off , ' said @entity64			0
' maybe one crewmate has a 400mm , maybe one has a midrange 85 - 180mm lens			0
' and then someone 's shooting with a wide - angle lens			0
we 're all shooting at the same subject at the same time in this rather small space			0
' ' you want to take pictures and share them freely with anybody who 's willing to look at your photography			0
and that , to me , is more of a compliment than anything else , ’ he added			0
astronaut @entity92 mission specialist for space shuttle @entity93 , takes in the view while sitting in the @entity14 on the @entity10 @entity64 shot this time - lapse photo while aboard the @entity10 in 2012			2
astronauts on the @entity10 are asked to take pictures of @entity2 and its surrounding , providing a scientific data set that has been recorded now for over 14 years			2

@entity14 is a module that houses one of the space station 's two robotic work stations and huge bay windows
robotic work stations are used by astronauts to manipulate the large robotic arm seen through right window
these windows provide a panoramic view of @entity2 , allowing astronaut 's to take images using eight cameras
