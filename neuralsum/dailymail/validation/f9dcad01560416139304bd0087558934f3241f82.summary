as @entity1 delivered his ‘ giveaway ’ budget today , it was n't just his generous economic measures that got people talking			1
the chancellor of the exchequer appeared to be in the final stages of an image overhaul , adding the finishing touches to his new slimline figure and modern haircut with a trendy suit			2
and as he stepped out of @entity13 this morning , he was snapped with what appeared to be a face of makeup			0
however , thanks to a lifestyle makeover – which included lots of jogging and fasting twice a week on the 5:2 diet – the chancellor today cut a trimmer figure			1
the 43 - year - old 's new haircut was also compared to @entity35 movie star @entity34 ’s in his early days , with a miniature wispy fringe edged over his forehead			2
but it was mr @entity1 's new suit that really drew reaction , with comments flooding on social media			1
mr @entity1 's new look echoed that of @entity35 actor @entity34 mr @entity1 was wearing a thick layer of make - up to present the budget critics called the ensemble a strange cut – and said it appeared too large around the shoulders and too short in the length of the trousers			1
it also featured large stitching around the lapels that gave it a childlike quality			0
but it was the decision to go for the old - fashioned , three - button suit that really got people talking on @entity20			2
@entity61 posted : ' not a fan of @entity1 's suit - strange cut			1
' while @entity64 tweeted : ' my old boss was on @entity67 and was convinced a man was guilty on the basis he was wearing a suit like @entity1 's ! ' and @entity71 added : ' @entity1 controversially going for three - button suit , against gentlemen 's outfitters orthodoxy			1
' @entity20 was awash with comments about @entity1 's suit today @entity78 fashion expert @entity77 said : ' he may be delivering the budget , but i did n't realise @entity1 was shopping on a budget			1
' this suit screams cheap to me			0
you can tell by the strange stitching and the high - cut , sloppy lapels			2
also a big give away is the wrinkling material			0
' it definitely looks budget to me			0
and a three - button jacket is a very old school , strange choice			0
' maybe his expensive suits were all at the dry cleaners			0
' bad timing , and bad choice , for one of his biggest and most - covered speeches in the @entity100			0
' mr @entity1 supporting a fuller face in 2001 , left , and last year , cutting a trimmer figure mr @entity1 in 2012 , when he was considerably heavier and less style - conscious fortunately for mr @entity1 , the suit took the attention away from the fact that his face was seemingly covered in a thick layer of foundation			1
despite a few setbacks , the chancellor 's style transformation has been a vast improvement on his original look of five years ago			1
the style overhaul has been thanks to one of his senior government aides , @entity116 , who used to work as a producer for @entity120 political editor @entity119 before mr @entity1 hired her to manage his image			2
as well as his new look , she has also been responsible for the increase in appearances at places like building sites to make him appear more down to earth			0
thanks to a healthier lifestyle - and the 5:2 diet , which involves fasting for two days of the year , @entity1 has lost weight as part of his style makeover - pictured , left , in 2014 , and , right , today mr @entity1 has made appearances at places like building sites to make him appear more down to earth ms @entity116 was responsible for his new haircut and also for putting him on the 5:2 diet , which saw him slim down dramatically over the course of a year			1
the diet requires mr @entity1 to limit his intake to 600 calories two days a week and eat normally on the other five			0
it has been reported that the new look has been tailored to give him the best possible chance of succeeding @entity146 as prime minister when the time comes			0
how @entity1 's style has changed since he first delivered the budget in 2010 ... mr @entity1 wears a ' badly fitted ' three - button suit to deliver his budget today , left , although it 's similar to the outfit he wore in 2014 ( right ) , the trouser suit legs are too short , although he has slimmed down in 2013 , mr @entity1 cut a fuller figure , wearing a navy suit which looked puckered with one button fastened ( left ) , he was trimmer in 2012 ( right ) wearing a creased shirt and worn - out looking shoes mr @entity1 delivered his first budget in 2010 ( right ) looking pale - faced and wearing a crumpled suit that looked like a school uniform			1
he started to put on weight by the time the budget came around in 2011 ( left )			0

@entity1 delivered his new budget today
but many were more *interested* in the cut of the chancellor 's new suit
he was also *judged* on his *hairstyle* , slim frame and heavy make - up
