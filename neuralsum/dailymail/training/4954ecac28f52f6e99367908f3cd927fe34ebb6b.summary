our galaxy is suddenly looking far more crowded			0
@entity2 has confirmed a record setting bonanza of 715 newly discovered planets outside our solar system			1
scientists using the planet - hunting @entity8 telescope have nearly doubled the number of planets discovered in the galaxy to around 1,700			1
the planets eclipse or transit their host star from the vantage point of the observer			1
this angle is called edge - on			0
@entity2 says its new technique for spotting planets can be likened to the behavior we know of lions and lionesses			1
in our imaginary savannah , the lions are the @entity8 stars and the lionesses are the planet candidates			0
the lionesses would sometimes be observed grouped together whereas lions tend to roam on their own			0
if you see two lions it could be a lion and a lioness or it could be two lions			0
but if more than two large felines are gathered , then it is very likely to be a lion and his pride			0
thus , through multiplicity the lioness can be reliably identified in much the same way multiple planet candidates can be found around the same star			0
astronomers used a new confirmation technique to come up with the largest batch of planets announced at one time			1
twenty years ago , astronomers had not found any planets circling stars other than our sun. all the new planets are in systems like ours where multiple planets circle a star			1
four of those new planets are in habitable zones where it is not too hot or not cold			1
@entity2 's kepler mission announced wednesday the discovery of 715 new planets			1
these newly - verified worlds orbit 305 stars , revealing multiple - planet systems much like our own solar system			1
nearly 95 percent of these planets are smaller than @entity77 , which is almost four times the size of @entity78			1
this discovery marks a significant increase in the number of known small - sized planets more akin to @entity78 than previously identified exoplanets , which are planets outside our solar system			1
' the kepler team continues to amaze and excite us with their planet hunting results , ' said @entity89 , associate administrator for @entity2 's @entity90 in @entity91			0
' that these new planets and solar systems look somewhat like our own , portends a great future when we have the @entity95 in space to characterize the new worlds			1
' since the discovery of the first planets outside our solar system roughly two decades ago , verification has been a laborious planet - by - planet process			2
a record breaking day for @entity8 : the histogram shows the number of planet discoveries by year for roughly the past two decades of the exoplanet search			0
the blue bar shows previous planet discoveries , the red bar shows previous @entity8 planet discoveries , the gold bar displays the 715 new planets			2
now , scientists have a statistical technique that can be applied to many planets at once when they are found in systems that harbor more than one planet around the same star			1
to verify this bounty of planets , a research team co-led by @entity124 , planetary scientist at @entity2 's @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 , analyzed stars with more than one potential planet , all of which were detected in the first two years of @entity8 's observations -- may 2009 to march 2011			2
the kepler space telescope orbits around the @entity134 , 40 million miles from @entity78			1
it is named after @entity137 astronomer @entity136			0
it was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets			2
@entity8 is a space observatory launched by @entity2 to discover @entity78 - like planets orbiting other stars			1
data from @entity8 could help humans find alien life @entity8 's mission was supposed to be over by now , but last year @entity2 agreed to keep @entity8 running through 2016 at a cost of about Â£ 13 million ( $ 20 million ) a year			0
according to @entity2 scientists , there is , what 's dubbed , a ' @entity153 ' in space where the temperature is not too hot , or too cold , for water to exist in liquid form			0
any planets found in this zone could have life on them			2
if @entity8 is retired , @entity2 scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered			2
the research team used a technique called verification by multiplicity , which relies in part on the logic of probability			2
@entity8 observes 150,000 stars , and has found a few thousand of those to have planet candidates			0
if the candidates were randomly distributed among @entity8 's stars , only a handful would have more than one planet candidate			0
however , @entity136 observed hundreds of stars that have multiple planet candidates			0
through a careful study of this sample , these 715 new planets were verified			2
' four years ago , @entity8 began a string of announcements of first hundreds , then thousands , of planet candidates -- but they were only candidate worlds , " said @entity124			0
the blue bars on the histogram represents all the exoplanets known , by size , before today 's @entity194 announcement on feb. 26 , 2014			2
the gold bars on the histogram represent @entity8 's newly - verified planets			1
' we 've now developed a process to verify multiple planet candidates in bulk to deliver planets wholesale , and have used it to unveil a veritable bonanza of new worlds			1
' these multiple - planet systems are fertile grounds for studying individual planets and the configuration of planetary neighborhoods			2
this provides clues to planet formation			0
four of these new planets are less than 2.5 times the size of @entity78 and orbit in their sun 's habitable zone , defined as the range of distance from a star where the surface temperature of an orbiting planet may be suitable for life - giving liquid water			1
one of these new habitable zone planets , called @entity8 - 296f , orbits a star half the size and 5 percent as bright as our sun. kepler - 296f is twice the size of @entity78 , but scientists do not know whether the planet is a gaseous world , with a thick hydrogen - helium envelope , or it is a water world surrounded by a deep ocean			1
sizes of @entity238 found by @entity8 - boosted significantly by today 's announcement ' from this study we learn planets in these multi-systems are small and their orbits are flat and circular -- resembling pancakes -- not your classical view of an atom , ' said @entity250 , research scientist at the @entity251 in @entity252 , @entity127 , and co-leader of the research			0
' the more we explore the more we find familiar traces of ourselves amongst the stars that remind us of home			0
' this latest discovery brings the confirmed count of planets outside our solar system to nearly 1,700			0
launched in march 2009 , @entity8 is the first @entity2 mission to find potentially habitable @entity78 - size planets			1
discoveries include more than 3,600 planet candidates , of which 961 have been verified as bona - fide worlds .			0

newly developed technique to spot planets led to *massive* haul
four of the new planets are in habitable zones
nearly 95 percent of these planets are smaller than @entity77 , which is almost four times the size of @entity78
