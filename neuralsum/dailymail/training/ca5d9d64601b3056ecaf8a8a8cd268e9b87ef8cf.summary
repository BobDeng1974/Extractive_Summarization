by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:10 pm on 11th october 2011 a junior football league which stopped publishing scorelines from one - sided matches to spare losing players ' blushes has agreed to resume the proper reporting of results			1
the @entity9 had come under fire for listing all home wins as 1 - 0 and away victories as 0 - 1 to ensure the welfare of youngsters aged between 9 and 16 following heavy defeats			1
the league claimed to be keeping to @entity18 guidelines in withholding the true scores from its matches , but the ruling body has no rules requiring results to be changed			2
victory : the @entity25 has said it will now publish the correct scores on its website having initially insisted all results be recorded as either 1 - 0 , 1 - 1 or 0 - 0 to avoid embarrassing young players in a statement confirming that the @entity16 has now agreed to report actual scorelines , the @entity30 said : ' the @entity35 , in response to the @entity34 , have piloted a different system of recording results			1
' in hindsight , this was a decision that should have been taken in consultation with the member clubs of the league and the county @entity18			2
' following a meeting between the league management committee and @entity49 vice-chairman @entity48 , it has been recommended to the league by the @entity49 that in the interim , before a meeting of the league management and member clubs to discuss future policy of reporting results , the correct scores be reported			1
' a spokesman for the @entity18 commented : ' there 's an @entity18 rule that prohibits the publishing of results and league tables across all media for @entity65 and @entity66 age groups where the focus of the game is about learning to play without the pressure of full - time scores			1
' across all age groups , there are no rules , sanctions or @entity18 guidelines which indicate that the final score should be changed			0
' the league , which was founded in 1984 and has more than 2,000 players from clubs in @entity79 , north @entity80 and @entity81 , had said it would will also stop recording results for under - 11 teams altogether from next season			1
' still 1 - 0 ... despite 7 goals ' : the @entity86 had stopped recording thrashings , no matter how many goals young players scored the move drew criticism from parents , who said it made the league table a pointless exercise			1
one parent , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ this is because they do n’t want kids embarrassed if their team has lost ‘ if that ’s the case what ’s the point of having a league table up on the website at all ? ’ another parent , who also did not want to be named for fear of turning officials against his son ’s team , said : ‘ i think it ’s crazy - kids need to learn about winning and losing from an early age			1
they are n’t recognising the boys ’ achievements			0
‘ they might not want to embarrass the losing team but if one of the lads scores six or seven goals and that is n’t recorded what kind of message does that send to them ? ‘ the lads might as well not turn up			2
’ assistant secretary @entity127 said the league had introduced the results policy on its official website this year			2
but not everyone was against the moves and @entity133 , manager of the under - 11s @entity135 team , backed the move			0
he said : ‘ the children ’s welfare is paramount			0
the winners have three points on the website if they win and the children who lose 20 - 0 would feel very disheartened if it was on the website			1
‘ they might think of not playing			0
i think it ’s a very good idea			0
’ but mr @entity133 added there must come a point when players had to accept defeat			0
he said : ‘ i think probably by the age of 15 then they have an understanding that life is a bit of a competition and we are competing with other people			0
’ @entity159 , the double @entity160 champion , has spoken out in the past about the decline of competitive sports for children			0
she said it risked spawning a generation of bad losers and blamed a culture of political correctness for making ‘ competitiveness ’ a dirty word .			0

all results recorded as 1 - 0 , 1 - 1 or 0 - 0 as league refuses to record thrashings
' @entity49 have said it is a guideline and we chose to go with it . if someone else wins , the children do not need to be embarrassed '
