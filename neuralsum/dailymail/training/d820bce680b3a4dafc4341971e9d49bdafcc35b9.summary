' he continued : ' it is such an awful disease that millions of people suffer from , but the charity changed our lives and that 's why i became so adamant to raise so much money for them			2
' there 's no cure to @entity20 and it has often felt like a death sentence but since being introduced to @entity25 , @entity9 's life has changed dramatically			1
' there used to be a cloud hanging over her head but the charity has really helped her so i wanted to do as much as i could to raise awareness			0
@entity5 took part in marathons around the world including @entity54 ( left ) and @entity55 ( right ) @entity5 poses in @entity16 after completing seven marathons in seven days , the @entity56 can be seen behind him @entity5 says he was n't much of a runner before but the thought of his childhood sweetheart , @entity9 , got him through ' i signed myself up for the event without thinking - i 'm not athletic at all , that 's why i wanted to do it , to prove that if i can do it anyone can			1
' i put myself in a position where failing was n't an option , i often sign up to things without thinking but thankfully i 'm stubborn and determined enough to power through			0
' competitors had to complete each marathon in under eight hours and often only had time to sleep in airport lounges and on flights as they ran through marathons in @entity74 , @entity55 , @entity54 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , before finishing in @entity56			0
his fundraising on @entity80 drew attention from celebrities including @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
@entity5 was surprised to complete the challenge with very little training for the events in some of the harshest of conditions			2
he said : ' for me there was 500 per cent more effort going into fundraising than training for the actual marathons , i knew i 'd be able to do it - thinking of @entity9 got me through			1
' the @entity74 marathon was one the most interesting , getting there is so difficult because it 's such a remote area , then you have the cold to deal with , by the end of the marathon there were icicles forming on my beard			0
' @entity5 relied on compression socks , and careful taping of his sore feet to get through the seven marathons @entity5 poses in very little clothing with one of his fellow marathon runners in @entity74 @entity5 says that his hardest challenge came on the fifth day : ' day five 's marathon in @entity115 was the toughest			2
having done three marathons in the space of 37 hours i was extremely tired			0
' in @entity77 's marathon i took a break from the road to sing the song , @entity121 , for a couple who were getting married on the beach			0
' it must have been quite a surreal moment for them but i had time to spare on the run and thought it would be something special to make their day			0
' they did n't speak @entity131 so i could n't be sure but they seemed to enjoy it , i posed for a few pictures then went back to running			0
' at the final finish line in @entity56 , @entity16 , @entity5 was greeted by overcoming @entity20 , professor @entity136 , who runs the charity that improved the quality of @entity9 's life			1

@entity9 and @entity5 met when they were 18 and she says they have been inseparable ever since @entity5 looks please to see wife @entity9 who says she kept constant track of his progress during his challenge @entity9 says she knew @entity5 would complete the challenge even though he 's not naturally active @entity9 first noticed something noticed something was wrong when her words became slurred while in the bath			1
at the time she feared she 'd had a stroke but brain scans revealed she had multiple sclerosis - a condition that affects more 100,000 people in the @entity162			1
@entity9 said : ' i was n't given a lot of hope when they told me i had @entity20 , you ca n't help but think of a lifetime of wheelchairs and pain			1
' me and @entity5 have been inseparable since we were 18 and it seemed like a big axe hanging over us , i dreaded the way the disease would affect our family			2
' but since the programme i feel a lot more positive about the disease , i 'm healthier and am thinking a lot more about life beyond the disease			0
' i 'm amazed at @entity5 , he 's not a runner or an athlete by any stretch of the imagination , and he knew that , that 's why he choose the hardest one out there			2
' @entity9 went to cheer her husband on at marathon number four in @entity75 with daughter , @entity191 , 17 , taking a picture to mark the moment			2
she said : ' he did n't know i was coming so was just overwhelmed to see me			0
he looked absolutely exhausted but i knew he could do it			0
' i kept in constant contact tracking his whereabouts and how he was getting on , with every marathon he completed i knew he was one step closer to home			0
' when we went to pick him up from the airport it was amazing , there were around 50 kids from the boarding school where we work who came to welcome him home			0
' the charity has really changed my life , it has given me a spring in my step again so knowing @entity5 's raised so much for this charity is astonishing , he truly is my hero			2
