researchers have warned of a catacysmic supervolcano forming under the @entity2 they say could threaten life			2
the @entity5 team say two or more continent - sized ' piles ' of rock are colliding as they move at the bottom of @entity10 ’s thick mantle 1,800 miles beneath the ocean			1
they say the movement could be the beginning of a vast eruption that could threaten life on earth in 100 - 200 million years			0
volcanic lightning is seen over the @entity19 , over 500 miles south of @entity20 , @entity21 , on sunday , june 5 , 2011 : researchers now say undersea movement could lead to a ' supervolcano ' eruption that could cause mass destruction on @entity10 in 100 - 200million years the undersea movement is creating is creating a @entity29 - sized zone of partly molten rock , which researchers say could lead to one of two huge eruptions : a hotspot plume supervolcano eruptions like those during the past 2 million years at @entity37 ’s @entity36 , which covered @entity38 with volcanic ash			1
a gargantuan flood basalt eruption , similar to those which created @entity46 basalts 17 million to 15 million years ago , @entity41 ’s @entity40 some 65 million years ago and the @entity2 ’s huge @entity48 basalts , which buried an @entity50 - sized area 125 million to 199 million years ago			1
the discovery was made when seismologist @entity52 , the study ’s principal author and an assistant professor of geology and geophysics at the @entity5 , analyzed seismic waves that bombarded @entity10 ’s core			1
' what we may be detecting is the start of one of these large eruptive events that – if it ever happens – could cause very massive destruction on @entity10 , ' he said			1
but disaster is ' not imminent , ' he claims , ' this is the type of mechanism that may generate massive plume eruptions , but on the timescale of 100 million to 200 million years from now			1
' so do n’t cancel your cruises			0
' the new study , set for publication this week in the journal @entity10 and @entity76 , found that two or more continent - sized ' piles ' of rock are colliding as they move at the bottom of @entity10 ’s thick mantle and atop the thicker core some 1,800 miles beneath the @entity2			1
that is creating a @entity29 - sized zone of partly molten rock , which researchers say could lead to one of two huge eruptions			1
the first would be a hotspot plume supervolcano eruptions like those during the past 2 million years at @entity37 ’s @entity36 , which covered @entity38 with volcanic ash			0
the second possibility is a gargantuan flood basalt eruption , similar to those which created @entity46 basalts 17 million to 15 million years ago , @entity41 ’s @entity40 some 65 million years ago and the @entity2 ’s huge @entity48 basalts , which buried an @entity50 - sized area 125 million to 199 million years ago			1
' these very large , massive eruptions may be tied to some extinction events , ' @entity52 says			1
the @entity48 eruptions have been blamed for oxygen loss in the oceans and a mass die - off of sea life			0
this map shows @entity10 ¿ s surface superimposed on a depiction of what a new @entity5 study indicates is happening 1,800 miles deep at the boundary between @entity10 ¿ s warm , rocky mantle and its liquid outer core			1
using seismic waves to probe @entity10 ¿ s deep interior , seismologist @entity52 found evidence that two continent - sized piles of rock are colliding as they move , creating a @entity29 - sized blob of partly molten rock ¿ called a ' mega ultra low velocity zone ' ¿ which is the beginning stage of massive volcanic eruptions that won ¿ t occur for another 100 million to 200 million years			1
since the early 1990s , scientists have known of the existence of two continent - sized ' thermochemical piles ' sitting on top of @entity10 ’s core and beneath most of @entity10 ’s volcanic hotspots – one under much of the @entity2 and extending up to 20 degrees north latitude , and the other under volcanically active @entity134			2
using the highest - resolution method yet to make seismic images of the core - mantle boundary , @entity52 and colleagues found evidence the pile under the @entity2 is the result of an ongoing collision between two or more piles			0
where they are merging is a spongy blob of partly molten rock the size of @entity29 , @entity148 or @entity149 beneath the volcanically active @entity151 hotspot			0
the study ’s computer simulations ' show that when these piles merge together , they may trigger the earliest stages of a massive plume eruption , ' @entity52 says			2
@entity158 in @entity159 : three eruptions at @entity36 in the @entity161 over the past two million years covered much of @entity38 with ash			0
now researchers are warning of a new threat under the @entity2 which could lead to a new ' supervolcano ' eruption @entity52 conducted the new study with @entity168 and @entity169 of @entity170 , and @entity171 and @entity172 of the @entity173			1
' we did hundreds of simulations for lots of different variations of what the @entity10 might look like at the core - mantle boundary – the most simulations anybody has ever done to look at the core - mantle boundary structure , ' @entity52 said			2
' my study might be the first to show actual seismic evidence that the piles are moving			0
' they move around on the core somewhat like continental plates drift at @entity10 ’s surface			2
' seismic imaging uses earthquake waves to make images of @entity10 ’s interior similar to the way x-rays make ct scan pictures of the inside of the human body			1
the new study assembled the largest set of data ever used to map the lower mantle in the @entity2 by using 4,221seismograms from hundreds of seismometers around the world that detected 51 deep earthquakes originating more than 60 miles under the surface			0
@entity52 and colleagues looked for secondary earthquake shear waves known as s - waves that travel through much of the @entity10 , hitting the core , and then convert to primary compressional waves or p - waves as they travel across the top of the core			2
then they convert back to s - waves as they re-enter the mantle and then reach seismometers			0
@entity52 says the short bursts of p - wave energy are very sensitive to detecting variations in the rock at the core - mantle boundary			0
@entity52 performed 200 days of supercomputer simulations at the @entity5 ’s @entity229			0
he simulated hundreds of possible shapes of the continent - sized piles and state - sized blobs until he found the shapes that could best explain the seismic wave patterns that were observed			0
@entity52 says the merging piles are each about 1,800 miles diameter , forming a single pile some 3,600 miles wide from east to west and stretching across @entity10 ’s core beneath an area from @entity241 almost to @entity242			2
two blobs of partly molten rock – called a ' mega ultra low velocity zone ' , on the piles ’ edges merged to form a new blob that is perhaps 6 to 10 miles thick and covers an area about 500 miles long and 150 miles wide , about the area of @entity29 or ' eight to 10 times larger than any @entity251 we observed before , ' @entity52 claims			0
because the larger piles have n’t fully merged , seismic imaging shows there is a depression or ' hole ' between them , and the @entity29 - sized blob is forming there as smaller @entity260 merge in the hole .			0

researchers say eruption could cause ' very massive destruction ' on @entity10
warnings similar eruptions have lead to ' extinction events '
