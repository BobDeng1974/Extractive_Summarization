by @entity0 published : 15:40 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 17:47 est , 8 march 2013 beaming boy : @entity2 has been born with a rare genetic condition which means he will forget how to walk , talk and even smile with his happy face smiling back at you , it seems all the more cruel that even this simple pleasure will one day be taken away from baby @entity2			1
the 11 - month - old boy , from @entity9 , @entity10 , has been diagnosed with one of the rarest genetic diseases in the world - @entity13 - believed to affect just 150 people worldwide			1
closely linked to @entity16 - the disease which claimed the life of @entity20 's sister @entity19 earlier this year - it will mean @entity2 will forget how to perform basic motor functions such as walking and talking as he gets older			1
only discovered in 2005 , the disease which affects almost exclusively males occurs when a gene which controls brain function is duplicated			1
sufferers usually begin to experience seizures by the age of five which causes the brain to stop functioning properly			2
most require round the clock care and at least half will die before the age of 25			2
@entity2 's mother @entity32 , a nurse , and her husband @entity34 , said they were devastated when he was diagnosed with @entity13 three weeks after he was born on march 21 last year			1
mrs @entity32 , 36,said : ' as soon as @entity2 was born , i had a feeling something was n't quite right			1
' there was n't one thing in particular which set the alarm bells ringing - i think it was just my mum 's instinct			0
when we found out what was wrong with him , we were absolutely devastated			0
' hope : @entity34 and @entity32 with @entity2 and daughter @entity45 , three , are raising money to try and find a cure for @entity13 rare : @entity49 was diagnosed with @entity13 three weeks after he was born - the condition affects just 150 people worldwide ' we do n't know when exactly this will all start happening , but we 've been told @entity2 is likely to gradually regress once the seizures start			1
' it wo n't all happen straight away , but he is likely to lose most of his skills until he is like a small baby again			0
sibling love : @entity59 , three , enjoys making @entity2 laugh by pulling faces at him ' thinking of what @entity2 is going to go through fills me with panic			1
we have no way of knowing how bad the seizures will be , but they could be so violent they give him a heart attack			0
' i worry he will suffer one in front of @entity45 , because that would absolutely terrify her			2
' @entity75 , i 'm scared of being robbed of my son			0
we 're already falling in love with @entity2 's personality			1
he spends so much time laughing at @entity45			0
' the thought of all of that being taken away from us and him not even being able to smile is almost too much to bear			0
' the couple are battling to raise Â£ 1.2 million to fund trials in the @entity85 and the @entity86 which may be able to help @entity2 continue his favourite pastime - laughing as his three - year - old sister @entity45 pulls faces			1
' it is a lot of money but i could n't go to my grave knowing that i did n't do absolutely everything in my power to help @entity2 , ' said mrs @entity32			2
' we all love him so much no matter what but we want him to have some quality of life			0
' as it stands , i 'll have to care for him 24 hours a day and he 'll still be wearing nappies , even when he 's in his twenties			0
' people might think a cure is a long way off but i believe if we can raise this money we could see significant developments in @entity2 's lifetime			1
' @entity32 and construction company director @entity34 , 32 , have joined forces with other families affected by @entity13 duplication syndrome across the world to raise money for similar trials involving their son 's condition			2
professor @entity119 , from the department of neuroscience at @entity118 , said that he and his fellow experts are optimistic @entity13 duplication syndrome could soon be treated			2
recent experiments carried out on mice indicate the symptoms of @entity16 could be reversed by adjusting protein levels in the body			0
he said : ' the data from @entity16 is very encouraging that a viable treatment for @entity13 deficiency can be found			2
' the current models for how @entity13 is causing disease would apply to both @entity16 syndrome and the duplication syndrome			1
' however the model needs to be validated			0
but if it holds up , there is a reasonable expectation that treatments for duplication syndrome can be developed also			0
