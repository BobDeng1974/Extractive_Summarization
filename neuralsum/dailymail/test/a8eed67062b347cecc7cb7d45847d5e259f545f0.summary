no footballer has ever been late for kick - off because he was tied up negotiating a new contract			2
so , from the start , @entity4 ’s explanation for the end of his conversations with @entity7 did not stand up			1
it is n’t the talks that are the distraction			2
no player is sat in an office haggling over image rights , only to check his watch at 3.30pm and bolt out of the door			0
a player may feel uncertainty about his future			0
his brain may whirl over where he will play next season			0
@entity7 ? @entity24 ? abroad ? yet postponing the process to the end of the season does n’t solve that issue			1
if anything , it makes it worse			0
if @entity4 wanted to stop thinking right now , he could sign his new deal or tell @entity7 to come back in a year			1
he has , after all , got more than two seasons left on his existing arrangement			0
@entity4 has turned down a new deal with @entity7 and put off contract talks until the summer @entity4 ( right ) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £ 100,000 - a - week to stay at @entity7 the 20 - year - old gave an interview to the @entity41 on wednesday giving his reasons for his decision so all @entity4 did , the day his advisers ended negotiations until may at the earliest , was complicate his affairs			1
it is not as if he will be able to forget about the decision in the coming weeks , particularly as his stance appears to have damaged his relationship with @entity7 ’s supporters			1
without doubt , they were dissatisfied with his attitude even before this week ’s ill - conceived @entity41 interview			1
as @entity7 ’s hopes of a @entity59 place next season became increasingly remote with the home defeat against @entity61 , @entity4 bore the brunt of the dissent			1
in truth , his performance was little worse than any of his team - mates that day - but he is the one who is seen as disloyal , as rejecting at the first opportunity the club and manager that have best developed his game			2
@entity7 and @entity71 have done well by @entity4			1
they made him a key player in last season ’s title near miss , got him to the @entity76			0
he owes them a little more respect than has been displayed in recent weeks			0
he owes them enough to know it is downright rude to talk of being flattered by @entity24 just days before the teams meet			0
@entity7 are entitled to think it is equally flattering for a club of its stature to offer a salary worth more than £ 5million annually			1
@entity4 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity7 manager @entity71 during training on thursday @entity4 has played in various positions this season under @entity71 - including as a striker and at wing back among the reasons advanced for @entity4 ’s coldness towards a long - term commitment at @entity7 has been @entity71 ’s recent decision to play him at right wing back			1
this has been a result of injuries and suspensions , rather than a long - term strategy - but it does raise wider questions regarding the mindset of @entity107 players , and why many might find their pathway blocked			2
would a young player brought up through @entity113 ’s system , for instance , be so affronted by this temporary change ? why is it the @entity107 in particular that see football in straight lines ? @entity4 has played as a centre forward , a no 10 , a wide midfielder and now a wing back			2
is n’t this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams ? is n’t this an education ? why is it that @entity107 produces pigeon - holed full backs or midfielders , and not footballers ? should n’t a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of £ 100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere ? indeed , should n’t he welcome that endorsement from his manager ? @entity24 progressed to the 2006 @entity59 final at a time when @entity138 was injured			1
in his place through the knockout stages , home and away against @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 , was the 22 - year - old @entity146 midfielder @entity145			1
he had n’t played full back in his entire professional career , he said			0
but he never complained , and @entity24 did n’t concede in any of his six matches			0
midfielder @entity145 ( right ) was used a full back in @entity24 's run to the 2006 @entity59 final @entity145 is n’t a creative in @entity4 ’s mould - but then right wing back is n’t the same as left back , either			1
@entity4 is still operating as a winger when @entity7 attack			1
@entity145 , a central midfielder , was used strictly as a defender			0
it was n’t as if @entity158 was gung - ho in those games : three ended goalless , two in 1 - 0 victories			2
@entity145 performed with exceptional discipline			0
one imagines that midfielder @entity163 did n’t sign for @entity7 expecting to be part of a back three			2
@entity71 first used him as a defender this season against @entity167 in december , and he has remained there ever since			0
can is @entity169 , though , the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture			0
@entity76 - winning captain @entity172 eagerly switched between holding midfield and full back			2
midfield lynchpin @entity175 began his career as a right winger , while @entity179 can play centre forward , support striker , attacking midfielder and winger			0
every player will have a favourite position but in @entity107 these desires become entrenched			0
even the most gifted , such as @entity187 , never seemed entirely at ease with his versatility			0
maybe @entity4 should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be ; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than £ 100,000 a week			1
because that player goes wherever his team needs him — and that makes him worth the coin			2
@entity4 's @entity7 team - mate @entity163 ( centre ) has been used mainly in defence , despite being a midfielder			1
