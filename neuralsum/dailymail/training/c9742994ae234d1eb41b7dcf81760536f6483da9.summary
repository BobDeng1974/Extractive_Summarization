by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ ralphellis56 @entity3 boss @entity2 swapped his club suit and tie for a casual open neck and jeans on the touchline – but there was nothing dress down about his team ’s display			1
the @entity14 club who have started the @entity16 with two wins in two looked smart as they eased their way into the @entity20 ’s third round			0
and @entity2 , who made ten changes to the starting line - up that has beaten both @entity23 and @entity24 , learned he ’s got plenty in reserve			1
booked : @entity49 goals : @entity31 22			2
@entity40 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity61 6 ; @entity62 5.5 ( @entity63 55 , 5 ) , @entity64 6 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 5.5 ( @entity67 72 ) ; @entity68 5.5 ; @entity69 5.5 , @entity70 6 , @entity71 5.5 ( @entity72 59 , 5 ) , @entity73 5.5 ; revell 5.5			1

booked : @entity68 , @entity63 , @entity62 , @entity64			0
the rookie boss whose side stunned @entity84 and provoked the spending spree that brought @entity86 to @entity87 for a @entity89 transfer record has played the transfer markets like a veteran			0
and it was the star signing of his summer , @entity94 international striker @entity31 , who got the crucial first half breakthrough			1
the 29 - year - old , picked up for nothing from @entity98 , showed the class that has brought him 12 @entity101 caps as he spun on to @entity50 ’s pass and placed a shot in the bottom corner			0
it was a perfect opening shot from @entity31 in his battle to win the centre forward ’s role from last season ’s 24 - goal top scorer @entity54			0
and when the @entity111 striker replaced the @entity94 late on he was desperate to get on the scoresheet himself – but fired over from 12 yards and saw another effort blocked on the line			0
@entity50 , made captain for the night , was the one player who stayed in the side and was full of enthusiasm to enjoy his night			0
having a go : @entity31 tried his luck on a night when he endeared himself to the @entity122 crowd @entity50 , made captain for the night , was the one player who stayed in the side and was full of enthusiasm to enjoy his night			1
his pace troubled the @entity41 new boys early on and he was so proud of the chance to skipper the side that he refused to come off despite a nasty head wound in the second half			2
@entity50 ’s enthusiasm set the tone for a committed home display , and @entity135 also saw a quality debut from his own @entity139 @entity138 star , centre half @entity44 , who cost little more than a tenth of what @entity23 have paid for @entity143			0
and alongside him former @entity144 youngster @entity45 had an outstanding night to suggest that the @entity145 have plenty of depth in their squad			1
competitive : @entity40 battled hard but were unable to force an equaliser against @entity3 there were even some promising cameos from academy graduates @entity51 and @entity47			2
@entity40 boss @entity154 made five changes to the team that beat @entity157 , and clearly wanted to gain some momentum from a @entity138 success			1
but midfield man @entity70 wasted their one big opportunity when with half an hour gone he volleyed over the bar from six yards			0
however all the time there was only one goal in it , boss @entity154 knew his side had a chance and he turned away in despair when sub @entity72 drove a late chance to equalise over the bar			1
@entity154 could constantly be seen arguing with the fourth official when decisions did n’t go his way , but the truth was that @entity3 – even in dress down mode – had far too much quality			2
strength in depth : @entity3 manager @entity2 made 10 changes to the side that beat @entity24 on saturday jeans and shirt : @entity2 ditched the club suit and tie for a more casual outfit for the visit of @entity40			1

summer signing @entity31 put the hosts in front after 22 minutes
