the pilot @entity0 : @entity1 at the controls of a helicopter before his son @entity4 was born he always said giving up his flying career would be a wrench			1
but even prince @entity1 ’s closest friends are surprised by quite how strong the pull of piloting his own helicopter has proved to be			1
little more than eight months after quitting the @entity11 and his role as an @entity14 search and rescue pilot , it emerged this week that the @entity0 is itching to get airborne again			1
plans are being drawn up that could see him joining the @entity17 , based near his country home , @entity20 , in @entity21			2
some will doubtless see this as perverse , but then @entity1 has always been something of a ‘ reluctant royal ’			1
even with last year ’s announcement that he wanted to devote himself to conservation and charitable projects , it was also made clear that he had no wish to become a full - time working member of the @entity31			1
from his military career to wanting to be a farmer , to full - time dad to hankering after a return to the helicopter cockpit , all have crossed the @entity0 ’s mind — anything that delays the inevitability of his royal role			1
yet when the @entity0 has carried out public duties — as he and the @entity42 did in @entity43 on thursday — he has done them with great aplomb			1
his visit with @entity42 to @entity47 and @entity48 last month was such a success and pr coup , thanks partly to the winning presence of son @entity4 , that anti-monarchy support @entity54 slumped to its lowest level for 35 years			1
to the frustration of royal aides the issues that now cloud the mind of this young man — who is , surely , with his wife and son the @entity66 ’s greatest asset — have turned the clock back to another period of uncertainty in @entity1 ’s life , the time when he dated but seemed reluctant to marry @entity42			1
they are asking if prince @entity1 is now wobbling over his career in the same way he once wobbled over his choice of wife			1
it may be hard to picture now but almost exactly seven years ago the relationship between @entity1 and @entity42 was almost dead and buried			1
after more than four years together , they split up after @entity1 was photographed in a nightclub with his arm around a pretty young woman , his hand apparently cupping her right breast			1
@entity42 , who was already enduring the barbs of her ‘ @entity42 ’ nickname was not looking for a ring			0
she simply wanted to know where she stood and that he was committed to her			0
faced with what he saw as her demand for his long - term commitment , @entity1 declined to give it			1
and on that sad and uneasy note the romance was abruptly ended			0
as we know it was not terminal			0
@entity42 resolved to show @entity1 what he was missing , partying in thigh - skimming skirts			1
three months later , @entity1 , in the words of one of her friends , ‘ came crawling back ’			1
now it seems similar uncertainties have come crowding in as @entity1 struggles to adjust to a life that demands an increasing commitment to royal duties , and puts him more firmly in the limelight than he enjoys			1
the @entity111 , pictured receiving a teddy bear in @entity113 , @entity43 , on thursday , has always been a ' reluctant royal ' should he — having first obtained a commercial pilot ’s licence — take a role with the air ambulance ? the decision would expose the question that lies at the heart of @entity1 ’s hesitant attitude to his role in the monarchy ; just what kind of prince does he want to be ? like his mother princess @entity127 , he is a man of contradictions , capable of exhibiting a common touch			1
palace aides , for example , to the fact that whether they feel obliged to or not , @entity1 does not expect staff to bow to him or curtsey to @entity42 , and deny that , like his father , he possesses a short temper			1
so what has brought on this problem ? according to a friend he has missed the camaraderie of his air - sea rescue days in @entity145 more than he realised			1
‘ he genuinely loves flying and he loved being part of a proper working team in which he could be pretty anonymous and not given any special privileges , ’ the friend explains			0
‘ i think he has now found his royal life rather boring and feels he is worth more than just shaking hands			0
’ @entity1 has always been something of a ' reluctant royal ' there is no doubt that being in uniform gave @entity1 a structure and routine that allowed him and @entity42 to live as ‘ normal ’ a life as possible			2
since moving from their simple whitewashed @entity161 farmhouse to their grand @entity164 apartment so much has changed			0
the couple ’s altered circumstances have coincided with a growing number of official engagements being passed to prince @entity1 as he and the @entity0 take on more of the ageing @entity171 ’s duties			1
so the idea that he might return to flying will not thrill courtiers who fear a spanner is being thrown into the well - oiled royal works			0
but then @entity1 , 32 , next month , has always been a headstrong young man intent on doing things his way			2
it was he who chose the moment to announce his engagement — and the date of the wedding , ignoring officials who wanted the nuptials to be held in the summer			0
it was he who from the outset included @entity42 ’s parents in all the plans — unlike previous royal in - laws			0
and it was @entity1 who decided to give his fiancée his late mother ’s iconic sapphire and diamond engagement ring			2
‘ he likes to be doing things — but not being told what to do as he is for royal duties , ’ says a friend			0
‘ talking to him the other day he was enthusing about the farming course he had gone on at @entity111 earlier this year			0
it gave him a purpose			0
‘ there is no doubt he misses the adrenaline rush of flying his own helicopter			0
saving lives piloting an air ambulance would be the kind of excitement he has been missing			1
and he would be making the decisions rather than being told what to do by someone else			0
’ there is one other crucial factor — privacy			0
according to a close friend , the publication this week in @entity221 of a tasteless picture of @entity42 ’s bottom , snapped in @entity47 when a gust of wind caught her flimsy dress , has infuriated @entity1			2
‘ he can not bear that every time they perform public duties they are being scrutinised for everything they say and do , ’ says the friend			0
‘ it is how he remembers his mother being treated and he is determined neither he , @entity42 nor @entity4 will suffer the same way			2
’ on thursday he will visit an air ambulance team during a trip to @entity239 , near @entity113 , with his wife , the @entity42 the @entity111 shows the @entity0 one of the @entity242 helicopters , as prince @entity243 visits @entity244 on @entity161 in july 2012 after @entity127 ’s death @entity1 was given considerable privacy at school and university and he managed to prolong this by choosing a military career			1
since his teenage years , @entity1 ’s single - mindedness to do things his way has marked him out			2
it is why he did not join in when he might have been persuaded to fall in with roistering friends and do foolish things — – drugs , for example — – which characterised the growing - up years of his brother @entity259			0
this self - control and assurance was something prized within the @entity31			0
the @entity171 in particular knew how much stronger willed @entity1 was than his father , and appreciated that he was more positive than @entity243 who so often seemed to be wringing his hands about this or that			1
‘ @entity1 was seen as a young man who makes up his mind about something and then he does it , ’ says a @entity164 figure			2
but now , just as the royal roadshow needs to shift more towards @entity243 and his sons , @entity1 ’s stubbornness suddenly appears not to be such an asset			2
‘ the queen is 88 and quite simply the younger royals , like @entity1 and @entity259 , will have to do more royal engagements , not fewer			2
equally , the popularity of @entity279 in particular can not be overstated			0
’ quite how these increased royal demands could be met by the @entity111 if he started to fly air ambulances — which might involve him working ten - hour shifts on a rota of five days on and three days off — is unclear			0
‘ there are bound to be some misgivings , ’ says the figure			0
@entity243 is sympathetic to his son ’s wishes because he always regretted leaving the @entity289 and losing his action - man life when he was still young			0
for @entity1 , however noble the intention , the danger remains that such a move will be seen as an attempt to postpone his royal destiny			2
it may be that @entity1 , who did n’t realise what he had with @entity42 until he had almost let her go , needs to apply the same cool head that allowed him to swallow his pride then , and make up his mind			2
queen and country deserve that .			0
