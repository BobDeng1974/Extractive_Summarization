many people may not have heard of @entity1 before she struck gold at this month 's @entity3			1
but athletics fans know the @entity6 - based athlete has put in years of training to finally achieve a major title			1
and to her own surprise , victory has come when she 's least expected it			1
she told @entity12 : ' i 'm really chuffed			0
i have been trying to get a gold medal for so many years at a championships so to finally achieve it at the age of 40 with two young children is quite funny in some ways			1
years ago i would never had thought this would be the circumstances in which i achieve a gold medal			0
she trained and worked as a physiotherapist in the nineties before deciding to pursue a full - time career in athletics			2
since then , she has been to four @entity38 and won silver and bronze @entity25 and @entity40 medals			1
but she adds that her dream was to get that ' elusive gold '			0
it was winning gold that has kept her motivated to train after becoming a mother to @entity48 , five , and @entity49 , who will be one in september , with husband @entity50 - who is also her coach and manager			1
after she gave birth to @entity49 last september , @entity1 said she gradually returned to training but was n't sure if she would be able to return to form in time to qualify for this summer 's @entity54 and @entity40			1
team effort : @entity1 said she could n't have won the gold without the support of husband @entity50 , right , who helps her juggle training with being a mother to their children @entity48 and @entity49 she said : ' when i was pregnant i carried on jogging but i did n't do any hard running and i wore a heart rate monitor at all times			1
after i had @entity49 i took my time getting back into training as i just wanted to enjoy having a newborn			2
i carried on breastfeeding until april so in the early stages i just fit in what training i could around her			2
' when i got back into track sessions earlier this year my times were nowhere near what i needed to achieve so i thought it would be unrealistic for me to try and make the @entity78 team this summer			2
the trial for the @entity25 10k was in may and i really felt up against it			1
but i just kept working away and i qualified			0
' she qualified in style , beating athletes half her years and proving age and motherhood is no barrier to sporting success			0
as well as going on to win the @entity25 title over 10k - making her the oldest champion in the event 's 80 - year history - she also took a bronze at the @entity94 over 5k , roared on by the @entity96 crowd			1
go @entity97 ! @entity49 watches as @entity1 trains on the track ( babysat by @entity50 behind the camera here ) @entity1 said she hopes her success inspires other people not to give up on their dreams			1
' i think because i 'm still able to enjoy it , i am still able to run well , ' she explained			0
' i think some people retire too early from sport			2
i 've been pleasantly surprised in training at what i can still achieve and have n't noticed a reduction in speed			2
i can still be competitive			0
so i say to other people get out there and enjoy it , you 're not over the hill yet ! ' she certainly does n't have any plans for retirement herself just yet			0
other races this year will include taking part in the @entity122 in @entity123 in september and doing a half marathon in the @entity125			0
battling to bronze at the @entity40 : @entity1 thinks being a mother has improved her endurance she said she would love to do another marathon in the future with the aim of lowering her 2 hour 28 minute personal best time set in 2011			1
the @entity133 in 2016 remains ' a realistic possibility ' but she 'll decide nearer the time whether to target the 5k , 10k or marathon distance			2
as a mother - of - two , @entity1 said fitting in her 100 - mile - a - week training requires being flexible and she and @entity50 always ensure their children 's needs come first			1
she said : ' i 'm lucky that i have a supportive husband and it 's very much a team effort			1
@entity50 is also my coach and manager and he looks after the children while i 'm training			1
' sometimes i will train on my own or on other days they will all come with me to the track or the forest			0
' we fit the training in around the kids ' needs because being a mum is my priority			0
' @entity1 added that she thinks being a mother is one of the secrets to her recent success			1
' i think it has done me good because now i do n't stress about training like i did when i was younger			0
all i did then was eat , sleep , train , ' she said			0
' now i do n't stress about my training , i train harder than ever but i do n't worry if i 'm not hitting my targets			0
' i am so happy because i have two lovely children and a supportive husband			2
being happy gives me a lot of motivation and being busy as a mum has given me more endurance in a lot of ways			0
' as well as training and racing , @entity1 is also currently working as an ambassador for the charity @entity177 , who fulfil the wishes of seriously and terminally ill children			1
@entity1 said : ' i am honoured to promote the charity and give advice to their runners who are doing races like the @entity185 to raise money for them			2
' the charity is close to my heart being a mum			0
given what the children are going through , it â€™s so important to find ways to make their lives better			0
