by @entity1 reporter published : 08:19 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 01:42 est , 24 october 2012 blow : @entity3 , the @entity4 commissioner for justice and fundamental rights , has been forced to dilute her draft proposal for binding gender quotas a @entity4 plan to force companies to allot 40 per cent of board seats to women by 2020 has been dropped at the last minute , after lawyers argued strict quotas were unlawful			1
men currently represent over 85 percent of all executive posts in the @entity4 , an imbalance some prominent women in @entity4 institutions are trying to correct , but their efforts have run into widespread opposition			1
@entity3 , the @entity4 commissioner for justice and fundamental rights , has been struggling to overcome obstacles to her draft proposal for binding gender quotas , and had to scale back the plan after lawyers in the @entity27 said its main tenet was unlawful			1
ms @entity3 had wanted to push a binding 40 per cent quota for women on company boards , enforced with sanctions			1
and earlier drafts of her proposal showed that she wanted a quota to be enforced by 2020			0
but officials say that has now been diluted in the proposal , which was still being drafted ahead of a vote by the 27 @entity4 commissioners later on tuesday afternoon			2
the @entity4 's legal service said countries can not be obliged to reach the 40 per cent female quota , but can ensure that more is done to address gender bias on boards			1
previous drafts outlined hefty sanctions for companies which were not meeting the quota			0
in a recent version the size of such sanctions has been left to member states to decide			0
supporters of ms @entity3 's plans say men could also benefit from the corporate gender push			2
if a man who is out of work on paternity leave for a year is up against a woman in a job interview who had been in work for a year , then the man could get priority , one official said			0
many of the @entity4 's 27 member countries have already said they will not support ms @entity3 's proposal , and their opposition has also contributed to the softening of her position			2
a recent survey of female workers in the @entity76 showed the majority did not aspire to become directors			1
the survey of 547 female workers , by the @entity81 found , only four per cent aspired to join the board with a similarly small proportion saying they were looking to become chief executive			1
while some other female commissioners say they agree with the proposal 's objective , some say its unwieldiness and subsequent unpopularity could kill off much - needed debate on gender inequality			0
poll : a survey of @entity76 female workers found only four per cent aspired to join the board five of the commission 's nine female commissioners are against the proposal a commission official said while several of the male commissioners , including @entity106 's @entity105 and @entity107 of @entity108 , are in favour			1
@entity111 commissioner @entity110 is set to vote against it			0
her career has spanned several company board positions and two tenures as a commissioner			0
but despite the difficulties @entity3 's proposal faces , the gender debate has been high on the agenda of other @entity4 institutions			2
members of the @entity124 economics committee on monday rejected the appointment of @entity127 's @entity126 to the @entity128 , because no women had been considered for the post			0
while @entity126 is still expected to get the job , members of the @entity124 believe the stand has put the issue under the spotlight .			0
