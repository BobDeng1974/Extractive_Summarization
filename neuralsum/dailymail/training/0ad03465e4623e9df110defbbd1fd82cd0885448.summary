by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:03 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:00 est , 20 december 2013 indulgent : some pudding portions contain a woman 's rda of sugar diets go out the window at @entity10 and it 's no surprise that many of our favourite festive foods are high in sugar			1
but with a few canny choices , you can cut down on your intake whilst still having a sweet @entity10			1
health coach , @entity19 , 27 , a self - confessed former sugar addict , discovered there 's a huge difference in the amount of sugar in the same products from leading supermarkets			1
there 's as much as 30g difference in the amount of sugar in a portion of @entity10 pudding depending on whose offering you consume			2
@entity35 's christmas pudding comes in at the highest in sugar with a huge 56g per portion - that 's more sugar than the @entity40 recommend women consume in a day			1
in comparison , @entity44 @entity43 pud has 32g per portion			2
' for what is essentially the same food , that 's a big difference , ' @entity19 told the @entity50			2
she added : ' i was very shocked when i first realised just how much sugar was actually in a single @entity10 pudding portion , especially when you consider it 's nearly all of a women 's 50g daily limit in one go ( and it 's not unknown for people to have two portions )			1
' you can suddenly see how the pudding , mince pies , chocolate and alcohol could really add up to mean people are easily eating and drinking three times their daily sugar limit without even thinking twice			1
i think it 's useful for people to just be aware of this so they are careful with portion sizes			0
' @entity71 and the co-op 's @entity10 puds also came in high on the sweetness scale as they all had more than 50g of sugar per portion			1
more sugary by half : @entity80 the @entity79 has 56g of sugar per portion , left , almost double that of the @entity44 @entity43 pud a @entity35 's spokesman said : ' our taste the @entity84 is a once a year indulgent treat			1
it 's very high fruit content , including the delicious hidden cherry centre , means that this pudding is naturally higher in sugar than a pudding with less fruit			0
' the @entity40 recommend men have 70g of sugar a day and women 50g			0
eating too much sugar contributes to health problems including tooth decay , obesity and developing type - 2 diabetes			1
@entity19 , who writes the blog happysugarhabits.com , said people do n't need to deny themselves festive treats but they can cut down their sugar intake with some savvy choices and awareness of nutritional content			1
she said : ' i 'm often unpopular at this time of year as i 'm telling people not to eat mince pies and drink mulled wine			2
but with a few simple food swaps you can cut down on how much sugar you have so it wo n't ruin your @entity10			2
' @entity19 recommends : ' keep sugar somewhat sensible by looking for puddings that are at least under 45g of sugar per portion and where sugar is n't the first ingredient			0
this at least means that the sugars are from the more natural fruit source rather than refined sugarcane			0
' when it comes to mince pies , there 's also a vast difference between sugar contents between the various supermarket products			1
@entity80 the difference mince pies , left , are also high in sugar with 24.8g per pie compared to @entity135 from @entity44 mince pies which have 19.1g @entity35 's are the highest with their @entity137 containing 24.8g per pie			1
@entity139 has 22g but @entity140 is far lower with 18g in their chosen by you product			0
@entity19 said : ' a single mince pie can have up to 30g of sugar ( six teaspoons ) so look for ones that come in under 20g			2
even better opt for a mini mince pie which tend to average around 7g of sugar per portion			0
' for an even healthier mince pie , @entity19 recommends ditching the supermarket varieties for baking your own			0
she said : ' by making your own mince pies you can cut the sugar and the fat by using just dried fruit alone to sweeten the pie and swapping sweet shortcrust pastry with filo or puff pastry			1
' she also recommends making your own mulled wine to cut down on sugar as pre-made versions will have more in order to preserve them for longer			0
festive foodie : @entity19 says you can cut down on sugar and still have a sweet @entity10 with some savvy choices aside from mince pie and @entity10 pud choices , @entity19 recommends keeping your sugar intake down by snacking on other festive treats such as nuts , satsumas and cheese			1
if you do have chocolate she advises : ' opt for dark chocolates over milk or white ones			0
generally the higher per cent cocoa solids , the less sugar			0
' she added : ' do n't eat food mindlessly over the @entity10 period for the sake of it			0
you do n't need to eat every sugary food that 's offered to you			0
@entity189 out which days you 'll treat yourself , look forward to them , and have some control with the rest			0
' but there is hope for anyone who simply ca n't resist the sweet treats over @entity10 and are happy to keep indulging till the @entity198			0
@entity19 will be running a six week ' @entity200 ' programme from 6th @entity201 which she said will help people combat their sugar cravings for good			0
so next @entity10 , you wo n't be at the mercy of your sweet tooth			2
