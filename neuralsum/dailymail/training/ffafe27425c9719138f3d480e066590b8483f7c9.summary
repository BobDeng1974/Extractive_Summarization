by @entity1 reporter controversy : @entity3 characterised @entity4 as a ' christian country ' in a recent article @entity3 's controversial claim that @entity4 is a ' christian country ' risks sowing ' alienation and division ' in society , a group of leading public figures has warned			1
more than 50 writers , scientists , broadcasters and academics have signed an open letter expressing concern at the ' negative consequences ' of the prime minister 's assertion in a country where most people do not describe themselves as @entity24			1
signatories of the letter , published in @entity27 , include the authors @entity28 and sir @entity30 ; broadcasters @entity31 and @entity33 , the philosopher @entity34 ; and the human rights activist @entity35			1
it follows the article last week for the @entity38 by mr @entity3 - who in the past has been reluctant to discuss religious matters - in which he wrote of his own faith and his desire to infuse politics with @entity24 ideals and values			2
while the letter acknowledges that the prime minister is entitled to his religious beliefs , his comments do not reflect the country as it is today			0
' we wish to object to his repeated mischaracterising of our country as a " christian country " and the negative consequences for our politics and society that this view engenders , ' the letter states			2
' repeated surveys , polls , and studies show most of us as individuals are not @entity24 in our beliefs or our religious identities and at a social level , @entity4 has been shaped for the better by many @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70 forces			0
' we are a plural society with citizens with a range of perspectives and a largely non-religious society			0
to constantly claim otherwise fosters alienation and division in our society			0
' the letter said that mr @entity3 was wrong to ' exceptionalise ' the contributions made to society by @entity24 when they are equalled by those of people with different beliefs			2
author @entity28 is one of 50 signatories of the letter - which has been published in @entity27 ' it needlessly fuels enervating sectarian debates that are by and large absent from the lives of most @entity4 people , who - as polls show - do not want religions or religious identities to be actively prioritised by their elected government			1
' professor @entity96 , the theoretical physicist and science broadcaster and president of the @entity99 , who organised the letter said mr @entity3 's comments were part of a ' disturbing trend '			1
' politicians have been speaking of our country as " a @entity24 country " with increasing frequency in the last few years , " he said			0
' not only is this inaccurate , i think it 's a wrong thing to do in a time when we need to be building a strong shared identity in an increasingly plural and non-religious society			0
