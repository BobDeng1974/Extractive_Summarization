mouths on @entity1 were agape friday as @entity2 told congressional staffers that president @entity5 's recent one - night stay in @entity7 cost taxpayers more than $ 2.9 million – and that 's just for hotel space and rental vehicles			1
the amount covered @entity5 's march 25 - 26 stay in @entity13 's capital , plus two weeks of work by his advance team before the president participated in a @entity18 and @entity19 summit and a tour of the @entity21			1
the @entity22 first reported on a single requisition for lodging in @entity7 at a hotel called ' @entity26 , ' costing an estimated $ 1.52 million			2
@entity2 has found two additional requisitions , covering more than $ 396,000 at a @entity25 and $ 1.05 million in expenses for ' vehicle rentals			0
' ' the best view over @entity7 ... even from the sauna ' : @entity5 was in the lap of luxury for one night , and taxpayers chipped in for millions no generic lodging : ' @entity26 ' is the creme - de - la - creme of @entity13 's four - star hotels @entity38 ? even the ordinary rooms at ' @entity26 ' include bubbly and walk - in ' rain ' showers ; imagine what the presidential suite is like ! the cars were requisitioned from @entity44 , a @entity7 company that specializes in luxury limousines			1
' are you kidding me ? ' asked a senior aide to one @entity50 member of the @entity51			2
' the president is going to have to get used to flying commercial some day			0
i bet taxpayers wish that cay came sooner			0
' ' wow , that seems disgusting , does n't it ? ' said a @entity50 committee staffer elsewhere on @entity1			0
' i know we need to protect the president , but at some point you have to assume we spent a fraction as much to shuttle @entity63 around and protect him			0
' ' and why do nearly 1,000 people have to go on the trip ? are there really that many @entity69 agents and clipboard - holders ? this is a testament to why government needs to shrink down and start treating taxpayers with respect			2
' neither aide would agree to be named			0
a search friday on @entity77 found that rooms at ' @entity26 ' in @entity7 can be had for $ 320 per night on upcoming tuesdays , the same weekday @entity5 spent the night there			1
the presidential suite presumably costs far more			0
but even the top - tier rooms for ordinary travelers feature 46 - inch led tvs , private fridges with complimentary champagne and wine , and walk - in rain showers			0
including both ' @entity26 ' and the @entity89 , the brief stop in @entity7 required exclusive use of 387 hotel rooms and 143 rental cars , according to federal government procurement documents			1
@entity5 arrived in @entity7 on the second leg of a four - nation tour that included stops in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 the president spent his 24 hours in @entity7 at @entity103 and @entity18 summits , touring @entity21 , and sleeping in the lap of luxury @entity5 's ' @entity107 ' limo is a one - of - a - kind stretch @entity109 with armor plating on every surface ; he took it with him to @entity112 and the @entity113 in march the rental cars formed a formidable motorcade in @entity7 whenever @entity5 moved from event to event			1
modern car features mostly @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 sedans			0
a pool reporter traveling in the phalanx of vehicles noted on march 26 as @entity5 departed the city that ' [ t ] he streets were mostly blocked off and deserted , though some small pockets of onlookers waited behind police barricades to see @entity131 drive by			2
' according to the @entity133 , it now costs $ 228,288 per hour to fly the president 's customized @entity134			1
that hourly expense is up 27 per cent since @entity5 took office			0
the @entity5 entourage , which some reports claimed was 900 - strong , arrived in three planes which hauled an additional 45 vehicles – including the president 's armored @entity109 limousine known in the @entity145 as ' @entity107			1
' the @entity146 reported that @entity13 's cost for providing security and planning surrounding the president 's 24 hours stay was at least $ 10.4 million .			1

the @entity153 president spent a single night in @entity13 's capital , but taxpayers of both countries are on the hook for millions
his brief stay required the use of 387 rooms , and 143 rental cars from a luxury limousine *service*
@entity5 took three planes and 45 vehicles – including his *personal* armored @entity109 limo – on a six - day trip to four foreign countries
@entity172 now costs more than $ 228,000 per hour to operate
' are you kidding me ? ' said one *astonished* congressional aide , while another called it ' disgusting '
