justice secretary @entity0 apologies to the @entity1 for the breach in confidentiality phone calls between dozens mps and inmates have been recorded and monitored by prison staff , it emerged today			1
justice secretary @entity0 issued an apology to the @entity10 after revealing the extraordinary breach , which dates back to 2006			1
@entity12 condemned the ' truly shocking ' admission , as an independent investigation was launched by the chief inspector of prisons @entity16			1
mps were told that the @entity18 , which runs prisons across the country , had identified calls dating back to 2006 which had been recorded			1
it includes calls made by former labour justice secretary @entity25 and staff working for current @entity28 justice minister @entity27			1
mr @entity0 said he learned of the error last wednesday , and had come to @entity30 ' at the earliest opportunity '			2
in total , there are 32 mps ' whose calls or those for their offices appear to have been both recorded and listened to ' , mr @entity0 admitted			1
' for 18 of these mps it appears the prison did not list the number as confidential and therefore the action was not taken to prevent recording			0
' he added : ' in a further 15 cases , members appear to have been identified correctly on the system as @entity39 , but due to a potential failure in the administrative process the required action was not taken by prison staff so the calls were recorded and appear to have been listened to , one member falls under both categories			2
' prison rules state that communication between prisoners and mps must be treated as confidential where the prisoner is a constituent of theirs			0
mr @entity0 said there is no evidence that information from the phone calls was passed on to anyone else and he did not believe it was part of a concerted attempt to monitor calls			2
the justice secretary stressed it was part of the routine checking process and mistakes may have been made			0
he told the @entity1 : ' i have as yet seen no evidence that information was passed on to anyone else , i do n't believe this was part of a concerted attempt to monitor , it was simply part of the routine checking of this process to make sure nothing untoward was going on			0
' but clearly again , it 's something i 'll be asking @entity16 to confirm			0
' mr @entity0 said he believed all recordings have now been destroyed as they are only kept for a limited period			0
it emerged that a call made by ex-justice secretary @entity25 and one by the office of @entity28 justice minister @entity27 were among those recorded since improvements to the system in autumn 2012 , only one mp clearly identified on prison lists has had their calls with prisoners recorded and listened to , he added			1
but there have been a small number of cases where phone calls between prisoners and lawyers were ' accidentally recorded ' , mr @entity0 said			2
he added : ' whilst these have been dealt with individually with the prisoner at the time , i want to be confident that the safeguards for all confidential calls are satisfactory			0
' mr @entity0 said mr @entity16 will first report at the end of the month to ensure that safeguards to stop phone calls being recorded or listened to are in place before publishing a full assessment of the facts in early 2015			1
@entity12 's shadow justice secretary @entity114 said the revelations were ' truly shocking ' and welcomed the investigation to be led by mr @entity16			1
he pointed out that some of the conversations may have taken place with prisoners who had not yet been convicted of a crime			0
he told the @entity1 : ' what you have outlined in your statement is a very serious breach of confidentiality involving mps and their constituents			2
' many of us in this @entity10 will deal with constituents in prison , many of which i remind the @entity10 have not been found guilty of any crimes , on a regular basis as part of our duties as good constituency mps , often our staff speak to prisoners on our behalf as they do with other case work			0
' i am sure i am not alone in being shocked in hearing today 's news that some of these conversations have been listened into , that some of these conversations have been listened into and recorded			0
' @entity28 justice minister @entity27 said : ' this is a serious matter and everybody should be able to contact their mp confidentially , whatever their circumstances			0
' the @entity153 has appointed @entity16 , the chief inspector of prisons , to lead an investigation and i expect all officials to provide full and frank disclosures to this inquiry			1
