@entity1 boss @entity0 has had a complete change of heart by insisting he will embark on the first @entity4 campaign of his managerial career with a view to winning the @entity7			1
unsurprisingly he likes the incentive of the invite to the @entity9 that comes with the trophy and it will be interesting to see to what extent @entity1 ’s priorities change after the @entity13 , if they are off the pace in the @entity15 but still in this competition			1
‘ it ’s not a competition that ’s attractive to me , ’ he had said in february			2
‘ i do n’t see the appeal			2
it ’s for teams not good enough to be playing with the best			0
’ his tune has changed , and who can blame him ? it still takes 16 games to make it from this stage to the final in @entity39 in may , but @entity40 have upped the ante with the @entity9 place on offer and the @entity44 has moved to @entity1 , where he has a stronger squad and greater expectation than at @entity26			1
‘ the @entity7 is now a different competition , ’ said @entity0 here last night			1
‘ why ? well , if you won it last year you basically got nothing , just a trophy			0
now the @entity7 gives you the opportunity to play in the @entity9			1
that is a big challenge for us			0
’ nevertheless , @entity1 travelled to @entity57 for the first leg of their play - off tie against @entity60 with a 21 - man squad missing several senior players			1
five of those who started at @entity65 on saturday have not travelled — @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 — and there could be as many as nine changes			0
goalkeeper @entity73 prefers to carry on playing as will @entity74 , sent off at @entity75 and banned from sunday ’s home game against @entity77			0
back - up keeper @entity79 has not been included in the squad for this round after an extended @entity82 with @entity83			0
providing @entity1 qualify , they will submit another squad before the group stage which starts next month after the transfer window has closed			1
trophy target : @entity74 ( left ) , @entity89 ( centre ) and @entity91 train on wednesday it is a calculated risk against @entity60			1
the runners - up in the @entity94 should not trouble @entity1 but they gave @entity95 , managed by @entity96 , a fright in the @entity9 qualifiers , beating the @entity99 1 - 0 in @entity21 before losing 3 - 0 away			1
@entity1 are still capable of fielding a strong team , such is the depth available , and @entity0 intends to work closely with his medical team and the club ’s sports scientists to monitor individual fitness levels as the season unfolds			2
‘ the year is very difficult because of the @entity82 , ’ he said			0
‘ the players came in to train at different times			0
we need to analyse each case and work to decide what is best for the player and the team			0
we need to be clear when we start a recovery , not only ( a player ’s ) physical performance but his psychology , too			0
’ temperatures are expected to reach 38 ˚ c in @entity21 , where @entity60 play their @entity4 games in @entity119 ’s @entity20 because their own does not meet @entity40 ’s floodlight standards			1
change of tune : @entity0 once dismissed the @entity7 as a competition that ‘ kills you ’ ‘ we travelled four - and - a - half hours from @entity125 , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it is more than 30 degrees and it is tough for the players			0
it is a different environment			0
we need to be focused and ready			0
‘ we need to change our chip — our way of thinking — because @entity60 will be difficult opponents			2
’ @entity60 ’s @entity136 coach @entity135 is aware his side ’s task is a tall one , but insisted : ‘ there is belief			2
’ @entity0 will be satisfied if it all begins in the same way as his @entity4 debut as a player , also in @entity57 , when @entity145 beat @entity146 3 - 2 on aggregate in the @entity7 in 1996			1
water jets : @entity1 's training session in @entity21 is interrupted by the pitch sprinklers being turned on @entity151 is to always believe - @entity0			1
