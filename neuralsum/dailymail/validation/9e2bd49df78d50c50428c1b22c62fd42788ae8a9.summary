the absence of @entity1 from @entity3 's team was a major blow for @entity6 's side before their 2 - 2 draw in @entity9 in @entity10 qualifying on saturday			1
@entity1 was taken ill with flu shortly before the game but the legendary @entity14 goalkeeper was seen back in training on monday as the @entity3 stepped up their preparations for the visit of @entity19 's @entity18 in @entity20			2
the friendly is a repeat of the @entity24 group match which @entity3 won 2 - 1 and @entity6 will want his team to repeat the result as he looks for a response to the draw that kept @entity3 second in @entity10 qualifying @entity30 @entity1 missed @entity3 's @entity9 match with illness but was back in training on monday the return of @entity1 ( right ) provided a major boost to @entity3 ahead of their encounter against @entity18 @entity1 appeared to be over the worst of the flu , which ruled him out of playing against @entity9 @entity41 ( centre ) attempts to intercept @entity44 's ( left ) pass during @entity3 training @entity46 ( right ) controls the ball with his chest as @entity49 closes him down @entity50 ( right ) controls the ball under pressure from @entity53 during training in @entity20 @entity56 striker @entity55 could be in line to start for @entity3 against @entity18 on tuesday @entity6 ( left ) watches on as his @entity3 players warm up at the beginning of training @entity3 midfielder @entity61 ( second left ) controls the ball as @entity3 prepare to take on @entity18 @entity6 ( fourth right ) addresses his team as they look to put an end to @entity18 's seven wins @entity67 ( left ) runs to @entity6 after scoring @entity3 's equaliser in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity9 @entity70 lead the standings on 13 points , two ahead of @entity3 , who like @entity18 were left praising a goal from a debutant after the game			1
@entity77 - born @entity67 , a 58th minute substitute , marked his first appearance for @entity3 with a goal in the 83rd minute to rescue a point for @entity6 's team			0
but @entity18 and @entity3 failed to qualify from @entity82 in the @entity24 , which resulted in a managerial change for the @entity3 as @entity6 replaced @entity84			0
and @entity6 could be tempted into rotating his squad for the visit of @entity18 , with @entity56 's @entity55 potentially starting while @entity67 could get his second cap after marking his first with a goal .			0

@entity1 missed @entity3 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity9 with flu
but the goalkeeper was back in training on monday to boost the @entity3
the friendly is a repeat of the @entity24 fixture that @entity3 won 2 - 1
