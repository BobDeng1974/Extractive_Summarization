@entity2 concentration camp bosses , such as @entity3 , who claimed they were just ' following orders ' truly believed in what they were doing , researchers have claimed @entity2 concentration camp bosses who claimed they were just ' following orders ' truly believed and took pride in what they were doing , researchers have claimed			1
landmark studies on human behaviour in the 1960s and 1970s had founded the theory that people carried out evil act because they naturally follow orders from figures of authority			1
and @entity2 war criminals famously tried the defence at the @entity25			2
but @entity27 psychologists have challenged the fifty - year - old findings after going back and re-examining the original experiments			1
professor @entity30 of the @entity31 and prof @entity32 of the @entity33 , @entity34 , began their research ten years ago with a prison study which was broadcast on the @entity37			2
they found that volunteers given the role of ' guards ' only acted brutally when they identified with their role and believed their actions were necessary to maintain control			1
in a series of more recent experiments , they found that people will only bow to authority if they believe it is necessary to serve a greater good			1
professor @entity32 said : ' our own research shows that tyranny does not result from blind conformity to rules and roles , it is a creative act of followership that flows from identification with authorities who represent vicious acts as virtuous			1
' the researchers both add : ' a series of thoroughgoing historical examinations have challenged the idea that @entity2 bureaucrats were ever simply following orders			1
' this may have been the defence they relied upon when seeking to minimize their culpability , but evidence suggests that functionaries like @entity3 ( hanged in 1962 for his role in organising the @entity75 ) had a very good understanding of what they were doing and took pride in the energy and application that they brought to their work			0
@entity2 war criminals tried the defence that they were ' following orders '			1
pictured are concentration camp prisoners as @entity86 troops liberate the @entity2 concentration camp in @entity88 , @entity89 , 30 april 1945 in @entity92 ’s research on obedience to authority , carried out in the 1960s and 1970s , volunteers found themselves cast in the role of a ' teacher ' with the task of administering shocks of increasing magnitude to another man - the learner - every time he failed to recall a correct word			1
unbeknown to the ' teacher ' , the ' learner ' was an actor , and the shocks were not real			0
but to @entity92 ’s and everyone else ’s dismay , all participants proved willing to administer shocks of 300 volts and 65 per cent went all the way to 450 volts			0
this appeared to provide compelling evidence that normal well - adjusted men would be willing to kill a complete stranger simply because they were ordered to do so by an authority figure			0
@entity118 ’s @entity117 took these ideas further by exploring the destructive behaviour of groups of men over an extended period			0
students were randomly assigned to be either guards or prisoners within a mock prison that had been constructed in the @entity128			0
in contrast to @entity92 ’s studies , the objective was to observe the interaction within and between the two groups in the absence of an obviously malevolent authority			0
once again , the results proved shocking - and the abuse handed out to the prisoners by the guards was so brutal that the study had to be terminated after just six days			0
' typically too , roles and orders were vague , and hence for those who wanted to advance the @entity2 cause - and not all did - creativity and imagination were required in order to work towards the regime ’s assumed goals and to overcome the challenges associated with any given task			1
' ' @entity152 of this , the practical details of ‘ the final solution ’ were not handed down from on high , but had to be elaborated by @entity3 himself			0
' today 's understanding of the psychology of tyranny is dominated by two classic studies from the 60s and 70s : @entity92 ’s research on obedience to authority and @entity118 ’s @entity117 , which found people tended to simply follow orders			1
but the new study of these findings , headed by @entity168 suggests zealousness is the key to such acts of violence			2
@entity30 and @entity32 say that there is a ' believed morality ' behind people ’s actions			2
professor @entity30 said : ' in short , people do harm not because they are unaware that they are doing wrong , but because they believe that they are doing right			2
' the fundamental point is that tyranny does not flourish because perpetrators are helpless and ignorant of their actions			0
' it flourishes because they actively identify with those who promote vicious acts as virtuous			2
' it is this conviction that steels participants to do their dirty work and that makes them work energetically and creatively to ensure its success			0
' moreover , this work is something for which they actively wish to be held accountable - so long as it secures the approbation of those in power			0

people do not just carry out evil acts because they naturally follow orders , say experts
@entity27 psychologists instead found they must ' believe in what they are doing '
