in his most outspoken attack yet , mr @entity1 said @entity0 was ' sowing the seeds of division ' by accusing ' that bunch over there ' of being responsible for a shortage of housing , gp appointments and well - paid jobs			1
the shadow business secretary attacked @entity0 's ' abhorrent ' language about immigrants and the ' distasteful ' spectacle of the @entity21 song performed by dj @entity22 in a mock @entity24 accent			1

he accused mr @entity3 's party of using the same language about @entity41 immigrants as once was used against black and @entity43 people who moved to @entity6			2
he told @entity45 radio : ' they are asking people to give them the benefit of the doubt when a stream of @entity0 candidates and supporters have come out with the most offensive and racist things over the months			1
' what really worries me about this is there is not more of a row about the things we see coming out of @entity0			1
it 's almost as if people price this in			2
' they are now arguably one of the main parties , and a lot of this stuff is vile , is absolutely vile , and it 's not in keeping with our @entity6 values of respect , tolerance and fair play			2
' a new racism row erupted this week with the release of @entity21 , in which @entity22 sang in a @entity24 - accent warning of ' illegal immigrants in every town			1
read himself has insisted it was just ' a bit of fun ' , adding : ' i do n't have a racist bone in my body			2
i work across all cultures and creeds , i travel the world			0
i 've got so many chums out in the @entity85			0
i 've spent a lot of time out there			0
' but mr @entity1 , the son of a @entity89 migrant , said the song ' distasteful ' , adding : ' a lot of people have said they think it 's racist			1
i do n't know whether his intention was to be racist			0
' the rise of @entity0 has led to a growing debate about the need to control immigration , with @entity99 promising curbs on freedom of movement within the @entity103			1
but mr @entity1 accused @entity0 of using attacks on migrants to blame them for problems in @entity6			1
' what i find really awful is this notion that somehow all the problems in our country are caused by immigration			0
' all the problems that you have , whether it 's a getting an appointment at your gp , the fact you are n't earning enough at work , the fact your child ca n't get a house round the corner from you , is down to eastern @entity41 immigration			0
it is misleading and wrong			0
' seeking to blame it on " that bunch over there " is a complete con			0
' @entity131 1 dj @entity22 has launched a bid for chart success with a song singing the praises of @entity0 and its leader @entity3 mr @entity1 went on : ' the reason i find it abhorrent â€“ i 'll be frank , my name is @entity1 , clearly i 'm of immigrant stock - is the kind of things you hear people saying about eastern @entity147 these days is exactly the kinds of things they were saying about black and @entity43 people when they first arrived in this country			1
' we ca n't have any truck with that			0
that is not what we are as @entity157			0

the @entity169 said it was ' gravely concerned ' by @entity0 's deal to accept a member of the @entity165 @entity172 ( @entity172 ) into its grouping in the @entity174			2
