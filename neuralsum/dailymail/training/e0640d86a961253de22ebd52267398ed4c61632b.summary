it is the erotic novel that has housewives across the globe spluttering into their tea - and has sent sales of @entity4 soaring 71 per cent			2
@entity6 ' @entity5 , dubbed ' mummy porn ' for its appeal to the average married mother , has reignited the trend for erotic fiction - and has got everyone , even fellow bonkbuster authors - talking			2
last week @entity14 went on the record to say that whether @entity6 's trilogy was well - written or not was debatable - but what was certain was that the author had done writers like her a service by putting the bonkbuster back on the map			1
disappointed : lace author @entity23 says ' mummy porn ' trilogy @entity5 is ' infantile ' and now , @entity23 , author behind @entity26 erotic hit lace , has joined the conversation , coming out to discuss the racy trilogy ahead of the re-release of her book this summer			1
the 79 - year - old author has hit out at the @entity5 trilogy , saying it does not deserve the moniker @entity35 porn			1
instead , she says , the books are more worthy of the nickname ' baby porn ' , owing to the absence of any real boudoir action			0
speaking to @entity43 , ms @entity23 was disdainful of the global bestseller , calling it ' infantile ' and expressing her disappointment with how long it took before any real s&m was introduced			1
' it 's more like baby porn , ' she said			2
' you have to wait until page 200 for any sex at all			0
she does n't get her bottom spanked until page 400			0
' @entity6 nets herself Â£ 862,069 per week for the novel which has gripped the nation ms @entity23 also repeated a popular criticism of the trilogy , which ms @entity6 initially published herself using @entity61 's self - publication tool , saying that the prose was ' jerky ' and needed ' a good edit '			1
of course , ms @entity23 is not unaware that the success of @entity5 has paved the way for the re-release of her own erotic works			1
but she has her own theory as to why the sadomasochistic theme of the @entity5 trilogy has so successfully captured the imagination of women today			0
she thinks women are aroused by submission because ' so many women have experienced patriarchal violence from their fathers '			0
' i certainly did , ' she admits			0
' not that it made me find it erotic later in life .			0

@entity23 , 79 , says the writing is ' jerky ' and needs a ' good edit '
