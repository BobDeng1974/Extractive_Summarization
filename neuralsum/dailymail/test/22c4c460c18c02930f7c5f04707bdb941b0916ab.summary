i see @entity1 on the circuit and he ’s always good fun			1
he likes to make jokes of me ! i remember in @entity5 , at the last @entity6 , when i was competing in the 200m when most people saw me as a 100m runner , he killed me in the warmup			1
‘ what are you doing ? ’ he asked me			1
‘ this is for the 200m runners – the 100m was a few days ago			1
’ i told him i was doing the 200m			2
‘ why ? he asked again			2
i said i wanted to try it			2
he was winding me up			2
it was helping me relax , actually			2
@entity21 says @entity1 is a joker on the circuit and gives him great advice the young @entity26 athlete says he is nowhere near @entity1 's standard at the moment but it could be his time soon @entity30 has announced his participation in the @entity32 this summer it obviously worked , as i then ran sub- 20 and he was praising me a lot and saying great things about me			1
@entity1 gave me some great advice to really enjoy athletics and have fun with it			1
he told me to have patience with it , make sure you keep enjoying it and you will get serious when you get a bit older and start to take it more seriously but do n’t put pressure on yourself to perform			2
no matter whatever anyone says or writes , make sure you ’re always having a good time			0
he ’s good like that			0
i can take that into this year			0
i like to think i always have a great time when i go to compete			1
i always give a big smile before races because you never get bored of that feeling ; people cheering for you and making you feel like ‘ wow ’ all this training you ’ve done in the winter and throwing up on the track , all the hard slog is worth it			0
it ’s a brilliant feeling			0
hopefully i can get a bit more serious , now that i ’ve just finished uni and i will start to get a bit more competitive with those guys			0
i do n’t think @entity1 will be too worried about me at the moment , he ’s something special when he gets himself into shape and competing			1
i ’m very lucky to be around at this time when he ’s at his peak and running			0
to be in the mix and be a part of these guys is nice			0
@entity1 has been beaten before , which shows he is only human			1
after those guys have retired — sprinters like @entity81 and @entity82 — it ’ s quite open for people to step in and take the mantle			0
obviously the @entity86 and @entity87 sprinters have always been the top dogs , they are very powerful nations and hard guys to beat			0
in @entity26 and @entity92 we have some great young names coming through that can go on and push the performances up			1
i ’d like to think there is a chance for @entity26 sprinters to step into the void			1
we do n’t do the sport to come second or third			0
you do the sport to try to be the best			0
there will be a nice little gap opening and it will encourage a lot of people to step up their performance ten @entity26 sprinters - including @entity30 ( centre ) got together for as stunning @entity113 photoshoot as well as funding the @entity117 athletes , every week @entity115 players raise over £ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities			1
