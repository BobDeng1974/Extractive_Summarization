@entity1 sunshine could soon be powering homes in the @entity3 if an ambitious @entity5 project gets the green light			1

its investors have already spent £ 8 million ( $ 12.9 million ) on their project , which they claim will provide energy that is 20 per cent cheaper than other sources			1
@entity1 sunshine could soon be powering homes in the @entity3 if an ambitious @entity5 project gets the green light			1
the @entity8 project ( pictured ) aims to power up to 2.5 million @entity3 homes by 2018 using solar energy captured in the vast @entity1 plains @entity8 , a partnership between @entity3 renewables investor @entity20 , developer @entity22 , and @entity1 investors , has gathered three years of solar data from their site in @entity27			1
they are now seeking approval from the @entity3 government , who has recently allowed non-uk developers of renewable energy projects to bid for contracts that guarantee subsidies			0
' this is not a back - of - the - envelope fantasy , ' @entity35 , chief executive of @entity8 told @entity38 at @entity39			2
' we are working with some of the largest engineering firms in the world			0
this is a serious project			0
yes , it is risky like any big energy project is risky			2
' the @entity8 project will work with concentrated solar power ( @entity48 ) technology which uses thousands of mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto a central point			1
electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat , which drives a heat engine connected to an electrical power generator the @entity8 project will work with concentrated solar power ( @entity48 ) technology which uses thousands of mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto a central point			1
electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat , which drives a heat engine connected to an electrical power generator			1
the plan involves building an undersea cable to @entity66 to connect to the @entity68 grid			0
but earlier this year , industry analysts warned that northern @entity5 states carried significant political risks			0
vast solar farms are a blight on the countryside and will no longer be eligible for @entity68 subsidies , the environment secretary has declared			0
@entity77 said carpeting acres of agricultural land with ' ugly ' panels was preventing @entity3 leading the world in growing crops and raising livestock			0
two years ago there were just 46 solar farms			0
there are now 250 , with another 200 awaiting planning permission			0
miss @entity77 has announced that from january subsidies worth £ 2 million ( $ 3.23 million ) a year from the @entity90 's @entity89 will be axed			1
' @entity92 farmland is some of the best in the world and i want to see it dedicated to growing quality food and crops ' , she said			0
' i do not want to see its potential wasted and appearance blighted by solar farms			0
' they are ugly , a blight on the countryside and are pushing production of meat and other traditional @entity3 produce overseas			0
' the policy does not affect subsidies for those who put solar panels on their roofs , or those built on the roofs of public buildings to generate their own energy			2
landowners can still claim @entity3 subsidies from the @entity120 for solar farms , but these were slashed this year			0
@entity8 was an associate member of a separate solar project , @entity124 which last week announced that it had all but folded			1
the project aimed to help to provide up to 15 per cent of @entity68 's power from solar and wind parks in @entity5 and the @entity129 by 2050			1
@entity124 said that only three of its 19 existing shareholders had decided to stay on board : @entity134 's @entity133 , @entity136 's @entity135 and @entity138 's @entity137			2
they have decided to continue the project in an ' adapted format ' , @entity124 said , adding that it would now function as a service company in the @entity129 and @entity5			2
@entity8 , a partnership between @entity3 renewables investor @entity20 , developer @entity145 , and @entity1 investors , has gathered three years of solar data from their site in @entity27			1
the plan involves building an undersea cable to @entity66 to connect to the @entity68 grid ' costs were very high and some companies said we 're not that interested in the @entity129 and @entity5 , ' @entity124 chief executive @entity156 told journalists , trying to explain why so many shareholders had left			0
@entity124 's aim was to capitalise on the desert sun , which it estimated could provide more power in six hours than mankind could use in a year			1
spread over a 6,500 square mile area more than half the size of @entity165 , @entity124 's projected delivery of more than 1 terawatt hours ( @entity167 ) would have been almost enough energy to power the whole of @entity136 for two years			1
also , @entity68 has had its own solar power boom , raising questions about the need for imports			2
as a result , a number of major shareholders had already left the project in the past few years , including @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			0
@entity35 , chief executive officer at @entity22 : ' recent news around @entity124 ( @entity183 ) has raised some questions about the concept of @entity5 solar			2
' @entity48 is a proven technology and the @entity188 is an area of optimum solar resource			0
successful government programmes such as @entity191 in @entity192 prove that developing solar in the @entity188 is a cost effective source of renewable energy today			1
' this coupled with the growing energy demand and need for low carbon and non-intermittent power in @entity68 makes @entity5 an optimum region for large scale solar development			2

the @entity8 project has already spent £ 8 million ( $ 12.9 million ) on its plans
it is developing a solar farm in @entity27 , south *western* @entity1
it says it can provide energy 20 per cent cheaper than other sources
it works with concentrated solar power which uses thousands of mirrors
these reflect and concentrate light onto a central point , generating heat
