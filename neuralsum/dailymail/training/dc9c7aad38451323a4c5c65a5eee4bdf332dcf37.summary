by @entity0 published : 04:33 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 28 october 2013 a @entity2 district attorney whose predecessor refused to prosecute the parents of murdered beauty queen @entity5 despite their indictment for child abuse that led to her death has said he is not sure if he would have made the same decision			1
@entity11 said he did n't know if he would have pursued @entity12 and @entity13 after their six - year - old daughter 's body was found strangled and beaten at her family home in @entity18 , @entity2 , in 1996			1
claiming she had been murdered by an unknown intruder , they were never charged because former district attorney @entity22 refused to sign the document to prosecute them , citing a lack of evidence			0
but newly - unsealed grand jury documents revealed last week that @entity28 and mrs @entity5 were indicted in 1999 for child abuse by putting her in a situation that ultimately led her to her death			1
but despite their indictment , her parents were not prosecuted over her death and today the district attorney of @entity37 @entity11 : ' i do nâ€™t know if i would have made the same decision , but i know how difficult these decisions are			2
' the grand jury documents released in @entity18 , @entity2 on friday were compiled long before dna evidence led the da to publicly exonerate the @entity43 in 2008			1
@entity11 said he learned of the sealed documents when he took office in 2009 , but a review showed that the statute of limitations had run out on the charges			0
' my staff evaluated the @entity5 case to determine if there was any charge for which the statute of limitations had not run and for which there was conclusive evidence , ' @entity11 wrote in a lengthy opinion piece in the @entity59			0
' because there was none , we focused on other matters ( including four murders we tried in 2009 , two of which were cold cases )			0
' ' i do n't know ' : @entity18 district attorney @entity11 , left , said he was n't sure if he would have done the same as his predecessor @entity22 , right , in refusing to prosecute @entity5 's parents indicted : @entity12 and @entity13 , who are pictured in 2004 , were accused of putting their daughter in a situation that ultimately led to her death			2
mrs @entity5 died from ovarian cancer in 2006 the released indictments ' are nonsensical , ' said the @entity5 's attorney @entity77 on friday			0
' they reveal nothing about the evidence reviewed by the grand jury and are clearly the result of a confused and compromised process			2
the @entity5 family and the public are entitled to the benefit of the full and complete record , not just a historical footnote			0
' she added : ' the dna was not available to the grand jury in 1999			1
' what we have here is a release of a sliver of the evidence that the grand jury looked at and reviewed			2
it 's just based on incomplete evidence			0
' the parents of @entity5 were both indicted with child abuse resulting in death and acting as an accessory to a crime by the grand jury in 1999			1
on the child abuse charge , the grand jury wrote that @entity12 and @entity13 ' did unlawfully , knowingly , recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child 's life or health , which resulted in the death of @entity5			1
' on a second count of accessory to a crime , the grand jury wrote that each parent ' did render assistance to a person ' with the intent to prevent their arrest or prosecution ' knowing they had committed and was suspected of the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death ' a reporter for @entity135 and the @entity136 had filed a lawsuit to seek the records and the documents were released on friday after a ruling by a @entity2 judge in the four - page document , one of the counts read that they ' did unlawfully , knowingly , recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child 's life or health , which resulted in the death of @entity5			1
' even though the grand jury voted to go ahead with the charges in 1999 , the @entity153 had declined to proceed over fears he could not prove guilt without a reasonable doubt , the @entity59 reported			2
the body of @entity5 , a child beauty queen , was found bludgeoned and strangled in her family 's home in @entity18 on december 26 , 1996 , hours after she was reported missing			1
her parents had called police to report her kidnapping and said they found a note demanding a ransom of $ 118,000 for her safe return			0
after her death , her parents were placed under an ' umbrella of suspicion ' , an investigator said , but in 2008 , the @entity153 said that evidence suggested the killer was a stranger , not a family member			2
two years earlier , mrs @entity5 had died after a long battle with ovarian cancer			0
the statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002			0
the documents ' release comes just days after @entity5 's father said he did n't want secret grand jury indictments from his daughter 's case released to the public			1
@entity192 's attorneys had sent a letter to the @entity37 district attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire grand jury record would only defame the parents			1
' public release of the allegations of an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame ( @entity192 ) and his late wife @entity202 , ' the letter said , according to the @entity59			0
help us find the killer : @entity192 looks on during a 1997 television appearance as wife @entity206 touts a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of @entity5 ' mr. @entity5 will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those allegations in a court of law			1
' nor will the public have any ability to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury record is unsealed and opened to public view			2
' but the judge ordered the current da to provide a reason why the documents should be kept secret			0
he provided them to a judge on tuesday to determine if they were suitable to be released			0
officials told mr @entity5 that they would only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired			0
the judge also said that the court would not be permitted to release all of the information in the case			0
' the court is sympathetic to the position of mr. @entity5 , ; judge @entity243 said on wednesday , but a release of the entire record " would set a precedent that would impede other @entity245 in performing their functions under statute and rule '			0
december 26 , 1996 : @entity5 , 6 , is found dead in the basement of the family 's @entity18 home , several hours after her mother called 911 to say the girl was missing and that she had found a ransom note			1

@entity5 , 6 , was found strangled and with a fractured skull in her family 's basement in december 1996
her parents have long thought to have been involved in her death but were publically exonerated in 2008 after new dna evidence
but a 1999 grand jury indictment shows they were charged with child abuse resulting in her death - but they were never prosecuted
indictment was finally released after a ruling by a @entity2 judge
