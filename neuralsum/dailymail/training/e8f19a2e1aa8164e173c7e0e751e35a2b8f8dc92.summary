the hunt for alien life has so far focused on planets that may contain water , but scientists claim we should be looking further afield			0
a new study argues that alien species could exist on planets that contain an exotic substance known as ' supercritical ' carbon dioxide			2
this type of @entity11 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds , creating a supercritical fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas			1
a new study argues that bacteria ( pictured ) could exist on planets that contain an exotic substance known as ' supercritical ' carbon dioxide carbon dioxide becomes supercritical when its temperature exceeds 305 degrees @entity29 ( 32 ° c ) and its pressure goes beyond 72.9 the standard atmosphere at sea level			1
on @entity34 , it 's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment , but astrobiologists at @entity39 believe it could also be capable of sustaining life			2
' i always have been interested in possibly exotic life and creative adaptations of organisms to extreme environments , ' study co-author professor @entity42 told @entity48 at @entity49			0
' @entity11 is often overlooked , so i felt that someone had to put together something on its biological potential			0
' professor @entity42 and his team compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water , and found that they were more stable in supercritical co2			2
an international team of scientists found evidence of tiny creatures living inside the basalt of the @entity65 floor - covered by 2.5km of water and hundreds of metres of sediment a parallel universe of life exists hidden beneath our planet 's ocean floors and could help us search for life on other planets , research last year claimed			0
an international team of scientists found evidence of tiny creatures living inside the basalt of the @entity65 floor - covered by 2.5km of water and hundreds of metres of sediment			0
the results of their studies revealed evidence of a vast ecosystem whose characteristics are entirely different from any previously investigated			0
core samples taken from the sea floor off the west coast of the @entity91 contained traces of micro-organisms living in the total absence of light , and almost entirely disconnected from the world above			0
' we 're providing the first direct evidence of life in the deeply buried oceanic crust , ' said microbiologist @entity101 , who worked on the study as a phd student at @entity104			0
' our findings suggest that this spatially vast ecosystem is largely supported by chemosynthesis			0
' supercritical carbon dioxide makes enzymes choosier about the molecules they bind to , leading to fewer side reactions			1
they also found that a number of species of bacteria are tolerant of supercritical carbon dioxide			1
previous studies have found that microbes can live near liquid carbon dioxide trapped under @entity34 's oceans – and area where the fluid can become supercritical			1
the researchers believe that supercritical carbon dioxide may be present on @entity123 ( pictured ) , whose atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide			1
if it is , it may have trapped remnants of life once existed on the planet for instance , @entity131 samples taken from the sea floor off the west coast of the @entity91 contained traces of micro-organisms living in the total absence of light , and almost entirely disconnected from the world above			2
' it would be great to drill into areas with supercritical carbon dioxide on @entity34 and investigate those environments in detail , but this is obviously difficult because of practical limitations and huge expenses , ' @entity140 told @entity49			1
the researchers believe that supercritical carbon dioxide may be present on @entity123 , whose atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide			1
if it is , it may have trapped remnants of life that may have once existed on the planet .			2

supercritical carbon dioxide has features of both a liquid and a gas
it is created when @entity11 reaches temperature and pressure thresholds
some bacteria on @entity34 can survive in supercritical carbon dioxide
it may be present on @entity123 , as its atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide
*material* may contain remnants of life that once existed on the planet
