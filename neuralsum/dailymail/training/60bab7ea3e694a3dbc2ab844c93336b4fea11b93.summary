@entity1 medical chief @entity0 has supported @entity3 's conduct over the head injury sustained by @entity6 goalkeeper @entity5			1
and he insists team doctors are best placed to assess their own players despite undoubted performance pressures			0
@entity5 was substituted in the first half of last sunday 's @entity12 match with @entity13 , but only after playing on for 13 minutes after sustaining a head knock in a challenge with @entity16 forward @entity17			1
@entity5 is caught in the head by @entity17 's knee during sunday 's @entity20 @entity5 appeared to be out cold for a short while as @entity17 and @entity22 ( right ) tried to help him ' in the case of @entity3 , i think sincerely that the team doctor did a correct examination , ' @entity0 said at the @entity27 in @entity29 conference in @entity30			1
' she ( @entity3 doctor @entity33 ) came to a conclusion that he could go on , but she kept an eye on him and from the moment he did n't feel well - and that can happen in the case of concussion - they took again the right decision to take him off			1
' @entity0 insists team doctors must assess their own players and that the @entity45 means they should not compromise their ethics and morals to benefit the team they are employed by			1
' a team doctor can be under pressure of the coach , the whole stadium , ' @entity0 said			1
' ( but ) it is only the team doctor who knows very well the normal behaviour of his ( or her ) player			2
@entity17 apologises to @entity5 after the @entity3 goalkeeper is able to sit back up ' if he has had a concussion his normal behaviour can change			1
that , a neutral doctor can never judge			2
' it is the team doctor who has the medical responsibility over his players			0
he is the only medical person who knows his players			0
' but he can ask for assistance			0
it would , for instance , be good if someone else looked at the television images of how precisely an accident occurred			0
' @entity1 has amended regulations over head injuries to form rules in its competitions to stop the game for three minutes to allow a team doctor to examine a player			1
if more time is needed for a complete neurological decision the player should be replaced			0
@entity5 is treated again by @entity33 after he went back down with blood coming from his ear @entity1 , football 's world governing body , can not demand full - scale rule changes - that is the role of the @entity89 - but @entity0 hopes the regulation is adopted throughout the game			1
' we have now imposed that rule for our international competitions , ' @entity0 added			2
' i would be very grateful if this would go down to the 209 associations of @entity1			2
' i think it will be the case in many , many countries			0
i am behind that proposal			0
we must do our very best for the health of the player			0
' substitute goalkeeper @entity104 ( left ) eventually replaces the young @entity105 later in the first half			0
