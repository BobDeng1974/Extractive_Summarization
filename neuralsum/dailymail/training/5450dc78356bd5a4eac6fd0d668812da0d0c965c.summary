@entity0 said the system would be ' fairer ' than tuition fees and would be introduced ' in the medium term ' if @entity4 returns to power the government ’s decision to triple tuition fees will end up costing students and taxpayers more money – because half the loans will never be repaid , new figures have revealed			1
ministers increased the cap on student fees from £ 3,000 to £ 9,000 a year to fill the hole in university funding left by government cuts to the higher education budget			1
but , because student debs are written off after 30 years , 49.5 per cent will never be recouped , meaning the scheme will cost the government £ 2.5billion a year more than ministers claimed , @entity21 library figures show			1
at the same time average graduate debts have doubled from £ 20,000 in 2010 to £ 43,500			2
it comes after @entity0 , the shadow business secretary , revealed @entity4 would introduce a ' graduate tax ' on the earnings of those who go to university to replace tuition fees			1
mr @entity0 said the system would be ' fairer ' than tuition fees and would be introduced ' in the medium term ' if @entity4 returns to power			1
the @entity36 proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £ 15,000 , for a period of 20 years , with the highest earners paying higher rates			2
@entity4 is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £ 9,000 a year to £ 6,000			1
in 2011 , it announced the policy as it sought to win over disaffected former @entity49 voters angered by @entity50 reneging on a pledge to scrap fees and signing up to @entity53 plans to allow institutions to charge up to £ 9,000 a year – triple the amount students paid previously			1
the £ 6,000 cap is expected to be included in @entity4 's general election manifesto , but it is not clear how the party intends to meet such an expensive commitment			1
previously , @entity4 has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better - off students			2
the party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees , leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost			2
mr @entity0 , who is responsible for higher education policy , said introducing a full - scale graduate tax ' as soon as possible is my priority '			1
@entity79 ’s campaign chief @entity78 attacked the decision to increase tuition fees			2
she said : " @entity79 has long said that he thinks that the current system [ of tuition fees ] needs to change and a report out this morning , figures we ’ve gained from the @entity86 this morning show that the new funding arrangement , the increased tuition fees to £ 9,000 a year is actually costing the taxpayer more because half of those loans that people are having to take out wo n’t be repaid			1
‘ so we ’ve got young people leaving university with £ 30,000 , £ 40,000 worth of debt			0
nearly half of them wo n’t actually repay those loans so it ’s costing the taxpayer more anyway			0
’ the decision to hike tuition fees is one of the most controversial decisions of the @entity53			2
@entity50 , appearing on the comedy show @entity105 on friday admitted it had given him sleepless nights			0
however he also continued to defend the decision , adding : ' i 'm not prime minister so i ca n't do what i want			0
' cost cutting : @entity4 is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £ 9,000 a year to £ 6,000 the @entity49 have pointed to figures showing the gap between the number of rich and poor students wanting to go on to higher education had fallen since 2010			1
business secretary @entity120 has described the new system as ' better , affordable and fair '			0
he said : ' we have paid a price for this policy more than any other party			0
but the success of these reforms , with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university than ever before , shows it was a price worth paying			0
' regardless of family circumstances , all students can now obtain university level education as long as they meet academic requirements			0
this is a good legacy			0
' the figures , from university admissions service @entity137 , show 21 per cent of 18 - year - olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in @entity141 applied this year			0
overall , the richest 18 - year - olds in the @entity143 are 2.4 times more likely to want to go to university than the poorest			0
but in 2006 , when @entity4 was in power , the wealthiest were 3.7 times more likely to want to apply .			0
