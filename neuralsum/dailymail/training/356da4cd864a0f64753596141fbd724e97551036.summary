@entity0 , the @entity1 , has taken issue with @entity5 coach @entity4 's explanation for ' @entity6			1
' @entity4 said at a press conference on saturday that a sudden change in temperature or rubbing the footballs could be behind why balls used in the @entity5 ' @entity13 victory over the @entity14 that paved the way for his team to reach the superbowl were under - inflated			1
but @entity0 , who used to host a popular science kids show , disputed that theory on @entity21 yesterday			1
' i do n't think you can change the pressure ( like that ) , ' @entity0 said			1
to really change the pressure you would need to use an inflation needle , he said			1
' what he said did n't make any sense , ' said @entity0			1
' i can not help but say ' @entity51 ! ' @entity0 said			2
coach @entity4 went into detail during his impromptu press conference , saying that the team conducted an internal investigation in which they simulated how their balls were stored and treated that showed how the @entity58 changed from when they were measured for air pressure before the game to after they came off the field			1
and earlier this week @entity62 , a professor of physics at @entity64 had said ; ' if they had inflated the balls inside the building and put it to the minimum amount , and then brought it outside to temperatures that were about 30 degrees lower , that would drop the @entity58 by between 1 and 2			2
meanwhile on friday afternoon , the @entity38 broke their silence on the issue			0
in a statement , the league said ; ' our office has been conducting an investigation as to whether the footballs used in last sunday â€™s @entity13 complied with the specifications that are set forth in the playing rules			0
' among other things , the league said they had conducted over 40 interviews , been reviewing video footage and even hired a forensics team to figure out what happened on sunday			0
while @entity5 coach @entity4 has been speaking out about his theories on ' deflategate ' his quarterback @entity40 also denied to the press of having any part in deflategate or altering balls			1
on the field : @entity5 quarterback @entity40 winds up for a pass during a @entity5 practice ahead of next sunday 's game inspection : @entity40 glares at a ball during the training session in @entity103 , @entity104 response : @entity40 has denied deliberately deflating the balls as the @entity38 continues their investigation the allegations of cheating using deflated balls and the accompanying press conferences are proving to be rich pickings for @entity113 comedians			2
@entity115 's opening sketch featured coach @entity116 - played by @entity117 - giving a flat denial at a ' press conference ' of any involvement in the unfolding scandal			0
@entity117 opened his ' conference ' saying : ' i have absolutely nothing to do with deflating those footballs			0
' i 'd like to spend the remainder of the press conference throwing my quarterback under the bus			0
' in case the implication was n't clear enough , he then said of @entity40 : ' i love him like a son , just more of an estranged son that i would n't trust around footballs			0
' ' @entity40 ' , played by @entity136 , then took the stage and played comically dumb about the allegations - describing the much - discussed science of ball pressure as ' nerd stuff '			0
laughing matter : @entity115 also joked about @entity6 during their show last night , featuring cast members @entity117 ( left ) as coach @entity4 and @entity136 as @entity40 ( right )			2

@entity4 says temperature or rubbing balls could be behind deflation
but popular scientist @entity0 says that theory does n't make sense
an inflation needle would be required to really change pressure , @entity0 said
