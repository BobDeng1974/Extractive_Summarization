shocking new images have emerged showing the risks taken and the injuries sustained by the young men who jump on to and off speeding trains in @entity5 in a desperate attempt to reach the @entity7			1
the majority of those attempting to hitch a ride on the trains are from @entity13 countries like @entity14 and @entity15 who are willing to risk their lives for the opportunity to work illegally in menial jobs should they ever actually reach the @entity7			1
referring to @entity22 as ' the promised land ' the train hoppers that manage to make it on to a speeding locomotive are seen clinging on for dear life as they tear through the countryside of northern @entity5 to the border they stand little to no chance of actually making it across			1
shocking : the images show the risks taken and the injuries sustained by the young men who jump on to and off speeding trains in @entity5 in a desperate attempt to reach the @entity7 making a jump : a man is seen either jumping or falling off of a speeding train as it passes through the @entity5 countryside near @entity42 treatment : a seriously injured young man is taken to hospital by medical workers after a failed train jump near the city of @entity49 recovery : @entity51 , 42 , is seen recovering after having both legs amputated at the @entity54 @entity53			1
@entity51 had both legs amputated after he tried to jump on a moving train in @entity57 before the @entity7 - bound trains appear on the horizon , the young men are seen relaxing and sleeping on the railway tracks of northern @entity5			1
many of them have already travelled thousands of miles from countries deeper in @entity22 - but their journey is far from finished			0
while many of the young men wait near train stations so they can jump on to trains that have yet to build up speed , others consider that approach fair to likely to raise the suspicions of the driver or platform guards			1
instead they wait out in the @entity5 countryside , where they are unlikely to have been spotted and make the death - defying leap on to trains speeding along the rails			1
while many somehow manage to make it on to the trains , others are unsurprisingly dragged beneath the 36 - inch steel wheels and crushed to death			1
one of the biggest threats to the young men 's lives is exhaustion			1
having already travelled thousands of miles and spent several nights clinging to trains or sleeping in the open , when the time comes for them to make the all - important jump , their bodies fail them and they either fatally miscalculate the leap , or else suffer life - changing disabilities			1
lucky : one of the biggest threats to the men 's lives is exhaustion			2
having already travelled thousands of miles and spent several nights clinging to trains or sleeping in the open , when the time comes for them to make the all - important jump they often miscalculate the distance rest : before the @entity7 - bound trains appear on the horizon , the young men are seen relaxing and sleeping on the railway tracks of northern @entity5			1

the majority have come from poverty - stricken countries such as @entity14 , @entity161 and @entity15 and are aged in their late teens or early 20s			0
another thing unites the men too - their all or nothing desire to start new lives in the @entity7 where , as illegal immigrants , they are unlikely to find work other than as exploited , below - minimum - wage workers in restaurants , cleaning and maintenance businesses and on building sites			2
' the trains are for the poorest of the poor , ' says @entity176 , a migration expert in the southern state of @entity179			0
' if they thought they had any other choice , they would take it			0
' nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains , but on certain days , in the most popular train towns - @entity192 , along the southern @entity189 , and @entity57 , a modest farming town south of the @entity191 - you will find hundreds , even thousands , of people waiting by the tracks			2
if they are lucky , they will hang on long enough to make it to @entity199 , where they switch lines in the massive train yards , and then in dwindling numbers head out again , pushing north to the @entity7 border , or as close as they can get			2
the risks are enormous : they must navigate a spidery network of aging rails — the trains themselves sometimes jump the tracks — through jungles and deserts and mountains , searing heat and icy rain			0
they face attacks by the bandits and gun - toting gangs that patrol the trains , and must hop off and on at immigration checkpoints , risking limb and life each time			2
the trip can take weeks , or months , if you allow for all the pitfalls and stopovers to earn a few pesos for food			0
death - defying : @entity5 tries to catch the train hoppers before they enter the country			1
but the southern border is porous , and , says @entity5 's immigration commissioner , @entity237 , ' we can not stop them all ' nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains , but on certain days , in the most popular train towns - @entity192 , along the southern @entity189 , and @entity57 and @entity49 ( pictured ) - you will find hundreds , even thousands , of people waiting by the tracks tragic : dozens of desperate young men die every year jumping on to @entity7 - bound trains in @entity5			1

in @entity161 , 130,000 lost their homes in @entity272			0
@entity15 is crippled by drought , and in @entity276 , one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere , the majority of the people have little or no work			0

' how many lose arms or legs along the way ? impossible to know - not everyone is counted			0
wedged between cargo cars , perched on tanker tops , stuck in stuffy boxcars , with money sewn into shirt cuffs and pants hems , they hop on , often in daylight , high noon even , because arresting impoverished migrants has not , historically , been a top priority in @entity5			0
women and children are most vulnerable , to both the elements and to the men , and are usually the most difficult to spot			0
if they can , they wait for the trains to stop in the dusty yards then make a dash for it			0
you can find them hiding in the dark hollows of the hopper cars , the children wide - eyed , their mothers fingering the family bible .			0

young men are seen clinging on for dear life as the trains tear through the countryside of northern @entity5
they leap on and off the speeding trains in the hope of a better life as a menial worker in the @entity7
dozens of young men die every year making death - defying leaps on and off the fast - moving locomotives
many are so exhausted that they miscalculate the leap and are dragged under the train 's 36 - inch steel wheels
