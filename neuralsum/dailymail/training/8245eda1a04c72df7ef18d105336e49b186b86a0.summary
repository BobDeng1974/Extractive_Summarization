by @entity1 reporter the ancient @entity4 crater where the @entity5 landed looks strikingly similar to the @entity6 in @entity7 with its looming mountains and hanging haze , scientists said on wednesday			1
' the first impression that you get is how @entity14 - like this seems looking at that landscape , ' said chief scientist @entity15 of the @entity16			1
overnight , the car - size rover poked its head out for the first time since settling in @entity20 , peered around and returned a black - and - white self - portrait and panorama			2
during the last few seconds , a rocket - powered spacecraft hovered as cables lowered @entity5 to the ground			2
in the latest photos , @entity5 looked out toward the northern horizon			0
nearby were scour marks in the surface blasted by thrusters , which kicked up a swirl of dust			2
there were concerns that @entity5 got dusty , but scientists said that was not the case			0
this @entity26 image shows a portion of the first 360 - degree panoramic view from @entity26 's @entity5 , taken with the @entity55 cameras ' we do see a thin coating of dust , but nothing too bad , ' said @entity60 , imaging scientist at @entity26 's @entity62 , which manages the $ 2.5 billion mission			1
scientists were giddy about the scour marks because they exposed bedrock below - information that should help them better understand the landing site			2
since landing , @entity5 has zipped home a stream of low - resolution pictures taken by tiny cameras under the chassis and a camera at the end of its robotic arm , which remained stowed			2
it also sent back a low - quality video showing the last 2 1/2 minutes of its descent			2
the rover successfully raised its mast packed with high - resolution and navigation cameras			2
comparing : the @entity6 stretches throughout southeastern and central @entity7 as well as southern @entity86 , southwestern @entity87 and northwestern @entity88 , in the @entity89 this @entity26 image shows a @entity92 - like self portrait of @entity26 's @entity5 taken by its navigation cameras , located on the now - upright mast with the mast up , it can begin its photographic days in force , including taking a 360 - degree color view of its surroundings as early as thursday			1
@entity15 said he was struck by the @entity4 landscape , which appeared diverse			1
there seemed to be harder material underneath the gravelly surface , he said			2
' it kind of makes you feel at home , ' he said			0
' we 're looking at a place that feels really comfortable			0
' @entity4 , of course , is very different from @entity14			1
it 's a frigid desert constantly bombarded by radiation			2
there are geological signs that it was a warmer and wetter place once upon a time			0
one of the mission 's goals is to figure out how @entity4 transformed			1
from above : curiosity is seen photographed here by the @entity121 instrument or @entity5 , showing the 15 - foot ( 4.5 - meter ) diameter heat shield when it was about 50 feet ( 16 meters ) from the spacecraft a view through a hazard - avoidance camera on @entity26 's @entity5 before and after the clear dust cover was removed			0
both images were taken by a camera at the front of the rover			0
after sailing 352 million miles and eight months , @entity5 parked its six wheels near the @entity4 equator , where it will spend the next two years poking into rocks and soil in search of the chemical ingredients of life			1
@entity26 has also revealed amazing new images from the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) camera aboard @entity26 's @entity141 , which captured the @entity5 and the components that helped it survive its seven - minute ordeal from space to its present location in @entity4 ' @entity20			1
' this latest image is another demonstration of the invaluable assistance the @entity141 team , and its sister team with the @entity152 orbiter , have provided the @entity5 during our early days on the @entity4 , ' said @entity154 , mission manager for the @entity155 at @entity26 's @entity62 in @entity156			1
' the image not only satisfies our curiosity , it can provide important information on how these vital components performed during entry , descent and landing , and exactly locate the rover 's touchdown site within @entity20			0
' in the image ( below ) the curiosity rover is in the center of the image			0
this amazing image from the @entity139 camera shows the @entity174 on @entity4 along with the components of its landing system to the right , approximately 4,900 feet ( 1,500 meters ) away , lies the heat shield , which protected the rover from @entity181 ( about 2,100 degrees @entity182 ) temperatures encountered during its fiery descent			1
on the lower left , about 2,020 feet ( 615 meters ) away , are the parachute and back shell			0
the parachute has a constructed diameter of 71 feet ( almost 21.5 meters ) and an inflated diameter of 51 feet ( nearly 16 meters )			0
the back shell remains connected to the chute via 80 suspension lines that are 165 feet ( 50 meters ) long			0
to the upper - left , approximately 2,100 feet ( 650 meters ) away from the rover , is a discoloration of the @entity4 surface consistent with what would have resulted when the rocket - powered @entity155 impacted the surface			1
the parachute and back shell of @entity26 's @entity5 strewn across the surface of @entity4			1
' this is the first of what i imagine will be many portraits @entity139 will be taking of @entity5 on the surface of @entity4 , " said @entity202 , @entity139 investigation scientist at @entity62			1
' the image was taken monday at about 10:30 p.m. @entity208 when @entity141 was at an altitude of about 186 miles ( 300 kilometers ) , and we are getting resolution on the surface down to 1.3 feet ( 39 centimeters ) per pixel			1
' it is the most expensive and ambitious mission yet to @entity4			1
its ultimate destination is a mountain towering from the center of the crater floor			0
preliminary estimates indicate @entity5 landed four miles away from the base of @entity221 , thought to contain intriguing signs of past water - a starting point to learning whether microbial life could exist			0
before the one - ton , nuclear - powered curiosity can start roving , it has to undergo several weeks of tedious but essential health checks			0
since it was too heavy to land using traditional air bags , it used a heat shield , parachute , rockets and cables			0
an orbiting spacecraft spotted the discarded spacecraft hardware , including the ballast weights that were shed soon after entry into the atmosphere .			0

the clearest image ever taken of the surface of @entity4 reveals an @entity14 - like desert - scape that has been compared to the @entity6 in @entity7
