call : environment secretary @entity1 will today call for @entity2 to lead the way in adopting @entity5 foods ministers want @entity5 crops on supermarket shelves by the end of the decade after declaring they are ‘ categorically ’ safer than conventional food			1
environment secretary @entity1 yesterday made the extraordinary claim that millions of children in the developing world are ' dying or going blind ' because the controversial technique has not been more widely adopted			1
he blamed @entity17 reluctance to grow ' @entity18 ' for ' generating unwarranted resistance to the technology in the parts of the world ' that need it most			1
‘ over the last 15 years … every attempt to deploy @entity24 [ modified to boost @entity25 ] has been thwarted and in that time seven million children have gone blind or died , ’ he said			2
‘ i think all those who have thwarted the attempts to bring this in , for free , should reflect those are real young people			0
‘ young people will wake up this morning able to see and they will go to bed blind for life			0
some of them will die today			0
’ but when asked if he would feed a genetically modified tomato to his children , he first hesitated before saying ‘ yes ’			2
his bold claims that @entity5 crops are safer and would save lives were dismissed by critics as ‘ hysterical ’ and ‘ emotional nonsense ’ , which deflects from more sustainable ways of improving food security			1
environment secretary @entity1 claims adoption of @entity5 in the @entity2 could be as significant as the agricultural revolution mr @entity1 will argue that using @entity5 crops to improve yields will require less space , freeing up more greenfield land earlier this year , the @entity51 , which is working on the @entity24 project , denied reports that it was available for commercial planting , saying it has yet to pass safety tests or prove it could reduce vitamin a deficiency			1
dr @entity58 , of @entity59 , which campaigns to ensure any use of @entity5 is in the public interest , said : ‘ @entity1 has lost the plot when he starts claiming that @entity5 food is safer than the food we all eat every day			1
‘ genetic engineering can introduce new proteins into food or cause unexpected changes that are not fully understood and it is important that people can avoid such foods if they do n’t want to eat them			2
‘ claims that critics of @entity5 are killing babies elsewhere in the world is verging on hysteria			1
a decision on whether to grow @entity24 will be made in the @entity80 , not @entity81			2
it is in any case an unproven approach to tackling vitamin a deficiency and better ways exist to stop children growing blind			2
’ flashback : campaigners dump four tonnes of @entity5 soya outside @entity93 in 1999 at the height of the protests against genetically modified food @entity97 , policy director at the @entity98 , said : ‘ @entity1 is simply ignoring the science when claiming @entity5 crops are safe when there is no scientific evidence to support that statement			1
‘ and his claims that millions of people have died in developing countries because efforts to grow @entity24 have been thwarted is emotional nonsense			1
no one in @entity81 had any control over @entity111 and therefore , no way of stopping it			0
’ due to public concern , there are only a handful of products containing gm - crops currently available on @entity2 high streets			2
in recent weeks the prime minister , the government ’s chief scientific adviser , sir @entity121 , and science minister @entity123 have all voiced support for the controversial technology			0
many scientists have also voiced their support for the technique			0
due to public concern , there are only a handful of products containing gm - crops currently available on @entity2 high streets his bold claims that @entity5 crops are safer and would save lives were dismissed by critics as ' hysterical ' and ' emotional nonsense ' but a @entity140 study showed public support for ‘ frankenstein foods ’ declining from 46 per cent in 2002 to only 27 per cent now			1
campaign groups have also raised concerns over ministers ’ secret meetings with @entity5 lobby groups – details of which emerged only following freedom of information requests			2
currently , there are no commercial @entity5 crops in @entity2 , but livestock is commonly reared on imported @entity5 feed			1
so far biotech firms have been deterred due to tough @entity17 regulations			2
but mr @entity1 , a long - standing advocate of gm technology , wants to see an easing of the restrictions			1
he said he wants to see the controversial produce on @entity2 supermarket shelves before the end of the decade or ‘ as soon as possible ’			0
speaking yesterday from @entity164 in @entity165 , where he toured the only active @entity5 crop trial in @entity2 , he insisted the technology was safer than conventional farming methods			1
‘ it ’s not probably safer , ’ he said			0
‘ we have an absolute categoric statement from the chief scientific officer			0
’ regardless of the view in @entity177 , the administrations in @entity174 and @entity175 remain firmly opposed to @entity5 environment secretary @entity1 ( left ) and plant molecular geneticist @entity178 view a genetically modified crop trial environment secretary @entity1 insists @entity5 poses no threat to health or the environment and that it could feed a hungry world			1
here @entity184 examines his claims and identifies many disturbing questions : @entity187 @entity188 : @entity5 food is ‘ probably safer ’ than the meals we eat today			1
‘ there is no substantiated case of any adverse impact on human health , ’ said mr @entity192 : in may 2011 , independent doctors in @entity198 reported that toxins implanted into @entity5 crops to kill pests were reaching the bloodstreams of women and unborn babies			1
ninety - three per cent of blood samples taken from pregnant women and 80 per cent of umbilical cords showed traces of the chemicals , probably ingested by eating meat , milk and eggs from livestock fed @entity214 is no conclusive evidence about the health effects , but these toxins could conceivably trigger changes in the body , including allergies , miscarriages , abnormalities and even cancer			0
despite @entity1 's claims to the contrary , evidence from @entity2 trials and commercial cultivation in the @entity229 points to real damage to the ecosystem @entity232 : this modified crop – which developing countries have been reluctant to accept because of fears over @entity5 – contains high levels of vitamin a , which can protect eyesight			1
mr @entity1 ’s emotive claim was that : ‘ over the last 15 years … every attempt to deploy @entity24 has been thwarted and in that time seven million children have gone blind or died			2
young people will wake up this morning able to see and they will go to bed blind for life			0
some of them will die today			0
’ reality : children do not go blind overnight through a lack of @entity25 in their diet			0
in any case , the same vitamin is available more cheaply through many other natural foods such as green vegetables			0
doctors can also offer cheap supplement tablets where there is evidence of a problem			0
a protester carries an @entity261 banner environmental effects @entity188 : @entity5 farming is good for the environment			2
‘ there is a very strong environmental case for @entity5 , ’ said mr @entity1			1
‘ we can farm more efficiently , using new technology and using less land			0
it gives a wonderful opportunity to free up land for wilderness and forestry			0
’ reality : @entity275 from @entity2 trials and commercial cultivation in the @entity229 points to real damage to the ecosystem			0
@entity2 farms were planted with crops of oilseed rape and beet that had been genetically modified to make them immune to heavy spraying with a powerful weedkiller			0
the results , published in 2003 , revealed this spraying not only wiped out weeds , but also wild plants and insects			0
butterfly numbers were down almost a quarter in some areas.one strain of @entity5 corn – @entity295 – has been created by @entity229 biotech firm @entity296 to include a toxin which kills pests			2
@entity299 banned the crop last year because its pollen was believed to be harming bees			0
it is also banned in @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , and @entity309			0
@entity310 : @entity5 crops are better for the environment because farmers use fewer @entity314 : evidence from the @entity229 suggests that initial reductions in the use of chemicals on @entity5 crops are now being @entity320 study by @entity321 , a research professor at @entity322 , found the weight of chemicals used on @entity229 farms has increased by 404million lb since @entity5 was introduced in 1996			1
he warned : ‘ resistant weeds have become a major problem for many farmers reliant on @entity5 crops , and are now driving up the volume of herbicide needed each year by about 25 per cent			1
’ superweeds and @entity339 : ‘ thanks to biotechnology , farmers around the world have been able to protect yields , prevent damage from insects and pests and reduce farming ’s impact on the environment , ’ said mr @entity192 : weeds and insects sprayed with chemicals on @entity5 farms in the @entity229 have evolved to become immune to them			1
as a result , superweeds are now so rampant in some areas that growers have resorted to machetes , flame throwers and defoliant chemicals used during the @entity355			0
the biggest threats are giant ragweed and pigweed , which grow at a rate of more than one inch a day and reach a height of 10ft			0
@entity361 : high - yield @entity5 crops will save billions from starvation			1
‘ at this very moment there are one billion people on this planet who are chronically hungry , ’ said mr @entity1			2
‘ are we really going to look them in the eye and say we have the proven technology to help , but the issue ’s just too difficult to deal with , it ’s just too controversial ’ ? ’ reality : @entity374 published this week shows that increases in crop yields have been much greater in countries which have not adopted @entity378 of maize or corn in @entity81 , where farmers have rejected @entity5 , have risen more quickly over the past 30 years than those in the @entity229			1
yields of oilseed rape have always been higher in @entity81 than @entity198			0
this gap has grown since @entity198 started cultivating @entity387 research was carried out by a team based at the @entity389 , @entity390 , and published in the peer - reviewed @entity391			0
@entity394 cotton @entity392 : growing @entity5 cotton has been of huge economic benefit to poor communities in @entity394			2
‘ it has been a massive boon to some of the least advantaged people in the world , ’ said mr @entity192 : prince @entity321 has pointed out the high rate of suicide in @entity394 among farmers growing @entity405 in 2008 , he highlighted the ‘ truly appalling and tragic rate of small farmer suicides in @entity394 , stemming in part from the failure of many @entity5 crop varieties ’			1
he has been accused by the @entity5 lobby of being ‘ luddite ’ and ‘ ignoring ’ the potential benefits of @entity5 crops to feed the @entity415 .			1

@entity1 said children are dying because @entity5 food is *n't* being adopted
*17million* farmers now grow @entity5 products around the world
but resistance to ' frankenstein foods ' has *slowed* *uptake* in the @entity427
blamed @entity17 reluctance to grow ' *frankenfoods* ' for ' generating unwarranted resistance to the technology in parts of world ' that need it
his bold claims that @entity5 crops are safer and would save lives were dismissed by critics as ' hysterical ' and ' emotional nonsense '
