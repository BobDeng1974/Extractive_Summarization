' dumbed down ' : exams in @entity3 primary school pupils are to be simplified to accommodate children who speak @entity3 as a second language in order to accommodate students who speak @entity3 as their second laguage , are colourblind or have learning disabilities , @entity6 is instructing exam writers to ‘ dumb down ’ exams , the @entity22 reports			1
the regulating body provides a list of the 1,000 most commonly used @entity3 words , instructing test providers to use them			0
it advised that using complex language could pose a problem for ‘ inexperienced readers ’ sitting @entity39 tests in primary schools in @entity41			1
this has led to accusations that the watchdog is insulting bilingual children and that the guide will lead to a drop in exam standards			1
‘ there should always be provision for children who speak @entity3 as a second language but there is no need to dumb down the exam terminology , ’ @entity49 , a former head teacher and chairman of the @entity51 , told @entity22			2
‘ it is an insult to these children			2
’ problem : the guide states that complex words and sentence structures could make exams unnecessarily difficult for ' inexperienced readers ' ‘ a lot of them are very bright , motivated and better at @entity3 than native speakers – and they wo n’t want to be sitting an exam that ’s been skewed for their sake			2
it represents an erosion of exam standards			0
’ @entity6 defended the guide , saying it was not specifically for pupils who spoke a foreign language , but that the changes would give all pupils an equal chance to show their level of knowledge and understanding of a subject			1
easier : the guide instructs test writers to use a limited number of verbs per sentence ‘ the guidance , which was developed in partnership with subject and assessment experts , aims to help achieve this , as well as making sure that questions properly assess the skills and abilities they are designed to test , ’ a spokesperson said			0
the 30 - page guide suggests that test designers should ‘ present information in short sentences ’ and ‘ use simple sentence structures with a logical conceptual flow ( subject , verb , object ) ’			0
it instructs examiners to ‘ avoid subordinate clauses ’ and discourages them from using complicated sentences such as : ‘ the man who was driving the car was in a hurry ’ as it contains a lot of condensed information , and should be written as : ‘ the man was driving the car			0
he was in a hurry			0
’ it encourages ‘ simple , active sentences such as subject - verb - object ( @entity126 ) ’ in favour of passive sentences and also advices test designers to avoid using more than 65 characters in one line			0
@entity6 also recommends an appropriate font size to be ' between 10pt and 15pt ’ and to use ‘ underlining , bold , italics , boxes , indentation and shading consistently , ’ to make exams easier to read			1
the watchdog concluded : that ‘ test developers and designers need to understand the principles explored in this document if they are to produce “ fair access by design ” for all pupils			0
