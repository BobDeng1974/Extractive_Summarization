by @entity0 @entity1 , son of @entity2 , said his father had acquired the priceless works legally art recluse @entity1 has said he wants the £ 1billion of art treasures taken from his flat by @entity7 customs officials returned to him – despite the fact at least some of the haul is @entity12 loot strong - armed from @entity14 people at knock - down prices			1
@entity1 , 80 , told @entity17 news magazine in a rambling interview laced with an overriding sense of victim - hood that his father @entity21 – a powerful @entity12 - era art dealer once tasked to sell modern art abroad for the regime to buy weapons – had acquired the priceless works legally and that he as his heir sees himself as their rightful owner			1
he is a man consumed with anger – at the state , at the media – even towards his sister @entity31 for dying of cancer			2
‘ she was two years younger than me and married			2
she should have outlived me , ’ he said			2
‘ then she would have inherited everything , and she would have known how to deal with this			2
now , everything is so miserable			0
‘ i will not give anything back voluntarily , ’ said the eccentric loner who has not been charged with any crimes			0
‘ i hope this gets resolved soon and i finally get my pictures back			0
‘ i ’ve never committed a crime , and even if i had , it would fall under the statute of limitations			0
if i were guilty , they would put me in prison			0
’ @entity1 , who suffers from a heart condition , said he had given state prosecutors investigating him on charges of tax evasion and misappropriation of assets ‘ enough ’ documents to prove his innocence			1
the art was seized in february last year but the existence of the collection only became known a fortnight ago , subjecting @entity1 to a media firestorm which he detests			1
the flat was raided by customs officials who had stopped him in 2010 on a train back from @entity62 with 9,000 euros in cash and empty envelopes stamped with the name of a @entity62 bank			0
they entered his apartment expecting to find undeclared cash – and instead stumbled on the most breathtaking haul of art seen since the war ended in 1945			2
‘ i am not @entity93 , what do these people want from me ? ’ he said , referring to the former @entity83 legend and the legions of journalists who camped outside the @entity87 flat where the 1,406 paintings by such greats as @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 were found			1
‘ i just wanted to live with my paintings , ’ he added			2
while his father sold many of the works he purchased on behalf of the @entity100 , he kept a vast trove for himself			1
most of the collection was believed lost or destroyed but was found behind tins of rotten food in his apartment			0
@entity1 's @entity87 flat was home to 1,406 paintings by such greats as @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 at least 500 of the pictures have been identifed as being bought at rock - bottom prices from @entity14 seeking to raise the necessary cash to buy exit visas from @entity113 ’s @entity7			1
@entity1 told @entity17 : ‘ i never had anything to do with acquiring the pictures , only with saving them , ’ he says			1
he added people should be thankful to him because he helped his father back in @entity118 when they saved the works of art from the advancing @entity121 in 1945			1
' my father knew the @entity121 were getting closer and closer , ’ he said			2
@entity124 lives in denial that his father bought collections at rock bottom prices from @entity14 seeking to escape the wrath of the @entity12 regime , even though cursory checks thus far have shown that to be the case for some of the art. at least 500 pictures have been identified as being bought at low prices from @entity14 seeking to raise cash to buy exit visas from @entity113 's @entity7 ‘ the pictures came from @entity7 museums or art dealers , ’ @entity1 says , adding that his father only co-operated with the @entity100 because he wanted to save the paintings from being burned			1
he added : ‘ it ’s possible that my father may have been offered something privately , but he certainly did n’t accept it			2
he would have found that unsavoury			0
’ but that denies the truth of @entity2 ’s role in the @entity12 : he was one of just four art experts hired by the regime to find modern art @entity113 classified as ‘ degenerate ’ , buy it for knock - down prices and sell it on abroad			1
post-war records show that @entity21 lied to the @entity155 after @entity113 fell saying that his collection was destroyed in the @entity158 bombing of @entity118 in february 1945			0
@entity1 says he has received a letter informing him that a number of works of art are going to be returned to him			1
he does n’t know which ones – but he believes he is entitled to receive the collection in its entirety			0
he clearly displays a deep sense of persecution in his interview , @entity87 is the ‘ source of all evil , this is where the movement was founded ’ , he says , referring to the @entity173 founded in the city			1
according to the reporter who interviewed him ‘ he keeps repeating the same sentence , and when he does his quivering voice becomes louder ’			0
@entity1 talks about the beginnings of the @entity173 in 1920 , and about the speech @entity113 gave in the @entity181 , in which he announced the party ’s manifesto			1
in @entity1 ’s opinion , evil still appears to reside in the city			1
” he admits he has never loved another human being - either a woman or a man - and says that the art that was taken from him is “ everything			2
” he added : ‘ there are people who are still climbing mountains at 97 , but i wo n’t live to be that old			0
at least they could have waited until i was dead to take away the pictures			0
there is nothing i have loved more in my life than my pictures			0
’ @entity17 added : ‘ when asked whether he has ever been in love with a human being , he giggles and says , “ oh , no ”			0
’ @entity1 has experienced many goodbyes in his lifetime : his father ’s death in a car accident , his mother ’s death , his sister ’s cancer			1
‘ saying goodbye to my pictures was the most painful of all , ’ he says			0
‘ i hope everything will be cleared up quickly , so i can finally have my pictures back			0

@entity1 hoarded a cache of 1,401 paintings in his @entity87 home
son of *dr* @entity2 who looted ' degenerate art ' for @entity100
claims father acquired the works legally and as his heir he is rightful owner
@entity72 launched a probe into him thinking he was a tax fiddler
