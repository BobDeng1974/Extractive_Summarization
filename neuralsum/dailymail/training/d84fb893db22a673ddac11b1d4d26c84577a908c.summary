an adult film star who tested positive for @entity3 - causing the porn industry 's third shut down this year - was reportedly trying to book a sex shoot after finding out his diagnosis			1
the male star , who has not been identified but is known to authorities , attempted to book a scene with a female sex actress that would appear via webcam in the days following his positive test results , according to @entity14			1
' we can f --- but do it on cam , ' he wrote in a text message obtained by industry blogger @entity19			0
' then it ’s not cheating			0
' the woman agreed to the shoot , however pulled out after it emerged the actor had returned a positive result during the mandated fourteen - day industry disease screening			2
anti-porn acitvists protest for a 100 % condom use policy in sexually explicit films in a move that is backed by the @entity32 ' [ the hiv - positive actor ] contacted [ the actress ] on december 5th at @entity35 and suggested that they do a webcam show together on sat dec 7th , ' @entity19 wrote on his site , adding [ the actress ] ' indicated that she was booked to shoot that day , but sunday would work			2
[ the hiv - positive actor ] agreed on sunday			2
' ' this is clearly after [ the hiv - positive actor ] would at least know that he had tested positive for something , and i find it hard to believe that 48 hours after the test he did n’t know what , but he had to know that he was n’t supposed to be shooting , he was even marked unavailable in [ the industry testing system ]			1
' this kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable and it shows a total disregard for her life			0
on dec. 6 , the @entity56 , an adult film industry trade group , announced its latest moratorium on filming , according to @entity59			1
' we are taking every precaution while we do research to determine if there 's been any threat to the performer pool , ' @entity56 ceo @entity60 said in a statement			0
' we take the health of our performers very seriously , and felt that it was better to err on the side of caution while we determine whether anyone else may have been exposed			0
' the male star at the center of the webcam claims is the cause of the moratorium			2
the news comes more than a year after @entity82 voters passed a ballot initiative that made using condoms in porn mandatory , however the rule was never enforced and later ruled to be unconstitutional			2
porn star @entity86 , who has been appearing in xxx films since 2010 , went public with her @entity3 diagnosis in august after it was revealed her boyfriend , @entity92 , had also contracted the disease @entity3 : @entity94 and his tearful girlfriend @entity86 talk to the press about their @entity3 results			1
there is no suggestion @entity92 is the star who tried to shoot a scene after his diagnosis in online post , the coalition explained that performers underwent mandatory testing for sexually transmitted infections every two weeks and that the performers prefer this to using condoms			1
' unfortunately , condoms are n't perfect , ' the blog said			0
in the shoots that can take several hours , they can cause abrasions known as condom rash which , paradoxically , can make it easier to transmit an infection if one does break			0
' for this and a host of other reasons , performers generally prefer to rely on the testing system over condoms			2
' porn industry leaders have also said condoms were bad for business , leading to a decline in pornography sales			1
as in previous @entity3 outbreaks , the industry is currently testing the performer 's on - and - off - screen sex partners to make sure that the virus has n't spread			1
it expects to have results early this week , according to the @entity56			0
in august , porn star @entity86 tested positive for @entity3 , forcing a six - day filming moratorium			1
on aug. 28 , the industry declared all performers who worked with @entity141 ' tested and cleared , ' but on sept. 4 , @entity141 's boyfriend , porn actor @entity94 , announced that he , too , tested positive for @entity3			1
@entity141 and @entity92 have since spoken out about unsafe industry practices			0
there is no suggestion @entity92 is the actor who tried to shoot scenes after his diagnosis			0
several other porn actors have also since tested positive			1
' ultimately , it 's just a big industry , and their main concern is money , ' @entity92 said in a september news conference			0
' if they do care that much about the performers , they would use condoms			0
' on sept. 6 , a third actor , whose identity has been kept secret , tested positive for @entity3 , prompting the second industry shutdown .			1
