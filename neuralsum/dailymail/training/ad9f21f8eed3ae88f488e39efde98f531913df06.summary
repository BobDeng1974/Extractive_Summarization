furious : @entity2 mp @entity1 is unhappy that the @entity11 hunt plans to oust its huntsman @entity13			1
he is being prosecuted by the @entity14 for illegal fox - hunting ms @entity1 , chairman of the @entity20 , says if the hunt does not support professional huntsman mr @entity13 in the run - up to the trial in the @entity25 , it could ‘ damage ’ the reputation of hunting across the country			1
the court case , disclosed in @entity29 last month , is threatening to embarrass mr @entity5 , who has ridden with the hunt , because it will reopen political divisions over the pastime and increase pressure on ministers to overturn @entity2 ’s 2004 ban			2
the row has also caused divisions in the @entity8 set – an influential group of @entity40 and media professionals who live close to the @entity44 market town			1
bad news for @entity5 : how we broke the story last month wealthy landowners , including @entity50 presenter @entity49 and sir @entity51 , chairman of the @entity53 excavator company , allow the hunt to ride through their woods and fields			2
the issue could surface at next month ’s annual £ 90 - a - head black tie hunt ball at the home of former racing trainer @entity60 and his wife @entity61 , the former chief executive of @entity62 – who is at the centre of the phone - hacking scandal			1
the fate of mr @entity13 , one of the country ’s best - known professional huntsmen , is to be decided at an emergency general meeting just days before the ball			0
insiders are predicting a fierce backlash if a decision is made to remove the popular huntsman and they believe many hunt supporters would boycott the ball			0
the row began after the current senior master of the hunt announced he was standing down next year , and the person chosen to replace him , @entity78 , said that he wanted also to take over the role of huntsman , who is in charge of the hounds during hunt meetings			0
miss @entity1 and senior figures in the @entity20 fear that such a move would undermine mr @entity13 ’s court case			0
in a letter to @entity89 , chairman of the @entity11 hunt , which has been leaked to @entity29 , she said : ‘ we must distinguish between the running of the hunt , which is your concern , and the public reputation and future of hunting as a whole , which is ours			2
‘ we are concerned that to replace , demote or make redundant the defendant in this case , at this particular time , to be potentially damaging for the wider cause of hunting , and the very people upon whom we rely to keep hunting going			0
’ mr @entity89 , an arable farmer who is married to three - day eventer @entity107 , is backing mr @entity78			0
he said : ‘ @entity13 has our full support in the legal action , but we needed a new senior master who could organise the hunting and our seven full - time staff			0
