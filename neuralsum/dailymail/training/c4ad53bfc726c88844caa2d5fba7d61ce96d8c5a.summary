published : 04:11 est , 25 april 2014 updated : 05:31 est , 25 april 2014 a farm is letting customers pump milk straight from the cow after installing a new vending machine that cuts out the milkman			1
farmer @entity6 , 56 , who runs @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , installed the machine to give his customers the freshest milk possible			1
the only process the milk goes through to get from the udder to the mouth is pasteurisation , which kills bacteria			0
mr @entity6 , who runs the farm and creamery with his wife @entity38 , 57 , is allowing customers to pour themselves milk , produced by @entity6 's 60 @entity42 cows , which graze just yards away , for just £ 1 a litre			1
father of five mr @entity6 said : ' you ca n't get much fresher than this			2
the milk is n't homogenised so the cream will separate naturally from the milk			2
' people can either shake the milk to mix it all back up , or if they fancy semi-skimmed simply take the cream from the top			1
' visitors can choose how much milk they want by pressing the ' stop ' button when they have enough and if they have n't got a traditional pint bottle they can buy a re-usable container for £ 2			0
the mechanism within the machine automatically calculates how much milk has been drained and it also gives out change			2
mr @entity6 , who runs the farm with his wife @entity38 , 57 , hopes the machine will mean almost none of his milk is wasted most of the farm 's milk , produced by their @entity42 cow herd , is used to make a cheese called @entity73 @entity20 and her mother @entity74 take advantage of the machine , which charges just £ 1 per litre mr @entity6 said : ' it has been amazing how popular the vending machine has been			1
it has just spread by word of mouth			0
' we had two girls come to sample the milk after they heard people talking about it down the local pub. we are out of the way in location but there is a steady stream of motorists who travel in this area			0
' we are happy to offer milk straight from the cow - a nutritious and wonderful tasting milk which a lot of people have never experienced before			1
' the @entity96 use most of the milk from their @entity42 herd to make a historic and popular cheese called @entity73 , which was invented in 1660 in the village of @entity73 , @entity101			2
but as the couple found they had lots of excess milk , they decided the perfect thing to do was introduce their vending machine , so nothing went to waste			0
mr @entity6 said : ' we are happy for people to come and help themselves			0
lots of younger people have been coming to sample our fresh milk which is great , as it 's so nutritious			0

farmer @entity6 hopes it will offer customers freshest tasting milk
users have to scrape cream off themselves if they want semi-skimmed
