desperate : @entity2 's highest court on wednesday temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate so it could consider a last - minute appeal			1
@entity9 's death was one of a number of botched executions the lengthy execution quickly re-ignited the death penalty debate as critics denounced it as cruel and unusual punishment and said it raised grave questions about the two - drug combination @entity2 uses for lethal injections			1
@entity9 had waged an intense , last - minute legal battle that challenged the state over key information about who supplies the drugs and how they are administered			2
the execution came after the @entity245 @entity181 denied several appeals seeking details about the state 's execution methods			2

@entity2 's highest court temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate wednesday morning so it could consider a last - minute appeal before soon allowing it to proceed			1

the execution occurred amid new scrutiny nationwide over lethal injections after several controversial executions			1
the @entity245 @entity181 on tuesday cleared the way for @entity2 to carry out its third execution in the last year following a closely watched @entity272 fight over the secrecy issue			2
going forward : a fence surrounds the state prison in @entity14 , @entity2 where the execution of @entity179 was scheduled to take place on wednesday @entity9 's lawyers used a new legal tactic in which defense attorneys claim their clients ' first amendment rights are being violated by the government 's refusal to reveal details about lethal injection drugs			1
@entity9 's lawyers were seeking information about the two - drug combination that finally killed him , including the makers of the drugs			2
a federal appeals court ruled in @entity9 's favor before the @entity245 @entity181 put the execution back on track			1

while many death row inmates have made the same @entity272 argument as @entity9 , the @entity181 has not been receptive to the tactic			2

states have refused to reveal details such as which pharmacies are supplying lethal injection drugs and who is administering them because of concerns over harassment			1
an @entity254 inmate in january snorted and gasped during the 26 minutes it took him to die			0
in @entity326 , an inmate died of a heart attack minutes after prison officials halted the process of his execution because the drugs were n't being administered properly			1
the fight over the @entity2 execution has also attracted attention because of a dissenting judge 's comments that made a case for a firing squad as a more humane method of execution			1
' the guillotine is probably best but seems inconsistent with our national ethos			0
and the electric chair , hanging and the gas chamber are each subject to occasional mishaps			0
the firing squad strikes me as the most promising , ' wrote @entity350 , the @entity351 's chief judge			1
' using drugs meant for individuals with medical needs to carry out executions is a misguided effort to mask the brutality of executions by making them look serene and peaceful - like something any one of us might experience in our final moment			0

double murderer @entity179 was pronounced dead at 3.49pm , an hour and 57 minutes after his execution began on wednesday
