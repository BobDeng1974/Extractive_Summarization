by @entity0 abandoned and decaying , this eerie @entity2 base was once was rumoured to house nuclear warheads in case of an attack but now stands empty , untouched since it was last used two decades ago			1
@entity6 in @entity7 was once a bustling strategic base for the @entity9 , hosting huge b - 52 bombers and a detachment of top secret u- 2 reconnaissance aircraft , deployed to covertly check out latest @entity14 weapons			1
however , 20 years after it was handed back to the @entity16 the abandoned buildings are slowly falling into ruin , yet still display poignant reminders of the troops once stationed there - even down to a menu offering tastes of home such as chilli dogs and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches			1
abandoned : @entity6 in @entity7 was once a bustling strategic base for the @entity9 , but now stands empty two decades after it was handed back to the @entity16 , its air traffic control tower slowly decaying empty : a guard tower situated on the perimeter of the base			1
one soldier is said to have committed suicide while on guard here , and there are rumours it is haunted on the menu : a faded menu in the base 's canteen reveals that airmen were given a taste of home with chili dogs , hamburgers and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the site had been used by the @entity50 primarily as a training base from 1918 to 1950 , before it was transferred to the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) at the beginning of the @entity2			1
under the control of @entity56 @entity55 ( @entity55 ) , and later as a home for @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , the base became a key strategic location during the period of political and military tension between @entity62 and @entity63			1
the site was visited by urban explorer @entity64 , who gained access to the military site through a friend involved in a project to conserve the base , protecting items and buildings which hold significant historical value			1
in shadow : this darkened office was once the mission control centre at the base , which was transferred to the @entity9 at the beginning of the @entity2 reminder : this detailed graffiti featuring an old fashioned plane was scrawled on the wall of the avionic building by one bored airman warning : a sign printed onto the door of a walk - in freezer at the old barracks , as pictured by urban explorer @entity64 , who gained access to the military site through a friend involved in a conservation project at the site detail : a decaying map covers the wall of the mission control centre			1
under the control of @entity56 @entity55 the base became a key strategic location during the period of political and military tension between @entity62 and @entity63 ' through him , i was able to gain approval for my visit			1
it would have been virtually impossible without that permission , as the large base is still patrolled and guarded by a full security team , ' said mr @entity64 , from nearby @entity110			2
amazingly , the menu in the troops ' diner has survived intact , and a strong @entity56 theme - from chilli dogs , hamburgers and french fries to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - is clearly evident			2
' stepping into the staff diner was like taking a trip back in time and across continents , ' mr @entity64 said			2
' none of it struck me as particularly appetising , though i suppose it was intended to make the @entity56 airmen feel at home			2
' record : a log book , still intact after two decades , lies abandoned on top of a boiler in one of the derelict building at the @entity7 base rack and ruin : an overturned chair in the abandoned guardroom			2
mr @entity64 described the base as ' unusually quiet ' , with no sounds of birds or other wildlife choice : the menu in the troops ' diner has survived intact , and a strong @entity56 theme - from chilli dogs , hamburgers and french fries to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - is clearly evident seat of power : the site 's @entity156 bunker was in regular communication with airbases around the world control : the order given to bomb @entity163 in 1986 in response to a discotheque bombing in @entity166 , as part of an operation codenamed ' @entity169 ' was reportedly given from this control room one building that mr @entity64 encountered was formed from a giant block of concrete and painted with windows to give the impression of an unassuming house			1
however , inside the reinforced concrete building , several vault doors led into a central storage space where the signs on the walls had been blacked out - with mr @entity64 ’s sources suggesting this was the space where nuclear warheads had been kept			0
the site ’s @entity156 bunker was in regular communication with airbases around the world , and it was reportedly here that the order was given to bomb @entity163 in 1986 in response to a discotheque bombing in @entity166 , as part of an operation codenamed ' @entity169 '			0
dated technology : sliding wall charts used display details of available aircraft and weaponry in the @entity6 mission control centre telecommunications : mr @entity64 described the sensation of walking through empty command rooms with the old maps and telephones as ' strange ' in use : the first group of @entity9 personnel arrived on the station in july 1950 , with the original organisation consisting of one officer and 26 airmen out of use : a rusting electricity generator , which once helped provide the base , first used in 1916 as a home for the @entity214 , with power geography : only a few details of this map of @entity219 can still be seen , as it peels off the walls of the abandoned mission control centre warning : a caution board at the side of the main runway , which stretches for a total distance of 8,300 ft after it was extended in 1950 when the @entity56 forces moved in ' it was a strange feeling , to walk through the empty command rooms with their maps and telephones , where these bombing orders had once been given , ' mr @entity64 said			1
' the base felt at times unnaturally quiet			0
although grass and vegetation grows throughout , there was no sound of birds or other wildlife			0
it was strange to explore such a large site , so completely devoid of life			0
' perhaps the most memorable thing about @entity6 was the size of the base			0
we spent a full day walking and driving around the compound , from the hangers and staff quarters , to store houses , watch towers , along the 8,300ft runway and through the command centres			0
sketches : graffiti on the wall of the avionic building still remains long after the airmen who painted it have gone illuminated : this panel still is connected to the electricity supply in the mission control centre , twenty years after the base was last used by @entity56 forces artifacts : compressed air cylinders in the base 's bomb store			0
the base has appeared in several film and television productions , portraying various fictional military sites , including @entity274 , @entity275 , and @entity276 historical value : water - cooled pipes inside a testing bay designed for test firing jet engines protection : several of the hardened aircraft shelters were placed on the @entity286 list of scheduled monuments in 2010			0
a bid was made in 2011 for the site to receive @entity291 status but it did not make the @entity294 shortlist ' as i walked around the base , i felt priviledged to be seeing inside the workings of such a large military installation			0
' i would find myself imagining what the base had been like full of life , with aircraft moving between the hangers and the runways , and all the control centres filled with voices and ringing phones			0

the writing on the wall : it is clear that this building was once home to the base 's bomb store storage : an aircraft hangar designed to house dozens of @entity56 fighter jets			2
@entity321 bombers , u- 2 aircraft and @entity323 all flew from the site in working order : the intercom system at the base is still fully functioning , long after the base itself closed down instructions : an instruction panel telling aircrew which items of clothing they should remove and when should they be exposed to dangerous gases all quiet : this mission control centre was once alive with the sound of voices and ringing telephones but is now eerily quiet			1

@entity6 in @entity7 was a bustling strategic base for the @entity9 during the @entity2
base was taken over by the @entity56 in 1950 and handed back to the @entity16 in 1994
it once housed huge b - 52 bombers and @entity350 reconnaissance aircraft deployed to make checks on @entity14 weapons
two decades after base was last used the menus remain , while the intercom system still works
