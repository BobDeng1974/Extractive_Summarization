by @entity0 sea levels could rise far more rapidly than expected because canyons under @entity5 's ocean - feeding glaciers are deeper and longer than previously thought			1
this was the warning issued by @entity8 after researchers in @entity10 created the most detailed map to date of @entity5 's vast canyon network hiding beneath its ice sheets			1
their map revealed new valleys that sink below sea level , which can make glaciers more susceptible to melting , according to the study			1
on the right is the bed topography beneath the ice sheet			2
on the left is the urface topography and ice velocities after @entity32 , @entity5 's ice cap contains the second largest mass of frozen freshwater in the world			1
the ice sheet ice sheet covers 660,000 sq miles ( 1,710,000 square km ) , or roughly 80 per cent of the surface of @entity5			1
currently , melting from @entity5 accounts is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise			1
researchers estimate half of @entity5 's outlet glaciers could undergo significant melting			1
@entity45 and @entity8 ’s latest study shows southern @entity5 's ragged , crumbling coastline is scored by more than 100 canyons beneath glaciers that empty into the ocean a number of other glacial valleys found in the study are deeper and wider than those shown in earlier maps , and are located farther inland at an average distance of 41 miles ( 67 km )			1
the findings mean some of @entity5 's scenarios for melting ice need to be revised , the researchers said			1
currently , melting from @entity5 accounts is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise			1

the @entity62 said last year that sea levels are likely to rise by between 10 and 32 inches ( 26 and 82 centimetres ) by the late 21st century , after a rise of just seven inches ( 19 centimetres ) since 1900 however , older ice sheet models predicted the speedup would be temporary because the glaciers would soon melt back onto higher ground and stabilise			1

the right image shows the latest mapping technique revealing the presence of a deep canyon that connects the ice to the ocean map of @entity5 is shown here			1
the ice is in white , ice - free land is in brown , and floating ice in blue ‘ the glaciers of @entity5 are likely to retreat faster and farther inland than anticipated , and for much longer , according to this very different topography we have discovered , ’ said @entity91 , a scientists at the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , @entity45 and @entity8 ’s latest study shows southern @entity5 's ragged , crumbling coastline is scored by more than 100 canyons beneath glaciers that empty into the ocean			1
many canyons are well below sea level as far as 60 miles ( 100km ) inland			1
higher ground , where glaciers could stabilise , is much farther from the coastline than previously thought			2
buried under the @entity106 , the subcontinent 's bedrock topography has been estimated using soundings from ice - penetrating radar			2
however , the wet and fractured ice along the southern coastline cluttered the radar soundings so that large swaths of the bed remained invisible			2
to overcome that problem , professor @entity91 and his colleagues devised an advanced technique to create a more accurate map			2
the technique makes the best use of several kinds of data : ice thickness measurements derived from airborne radar ; satellite radar interferometry data on the speed and direction of ice movement : and estimates of snowfall and surface melt to the sea			2
by combining the different types of data , they were able to map the bed topography along @entity5 's margins with unprecedented precision and detail			1
currently , melting from @entity5 accounts is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise			1
researchers estimate half of @entity5 's outlet glaciers could undergo significant melting ‘ the ice will stay in contact with the ocean for longer than we thought ’ , professor @entity91 told @entity143			1
‘ @entity5 is more vulnerable than we thought , but we ca n't say by how much			2
’ in august , a 466 mile - long ( 750 km ) chasm on the same scale as parts of the @entity151 was discovered beneath the @entity5 ice sheet			2
the canyon , which is as deep as 2,620ft ( 800m ) in places , is thought to predate the ice sheet , which has itself been around for millions of years			2
in another study offering another sea - level rise warning , vast glaciers in @entity32 seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries , according to scientists			1
in a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet ( 1.2 to 3.7 metres ) to current sea levels			2
a @entity8 study looking at 40 years of ground , airplane and satellite data of what researchers call ' the weak underbelly of @entity32 ' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted , crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino - like process			2
the coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level , holding back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt , he said			1
' it does seem to be happening quickly , ' says @entity185 glaciologist @entity184 , lead author of a separate study into the same phenomenon			0
' we really are witnessing the beginning stages			0
' it has the characteristics of a meandering river channel , although it dwarfs the @entity194 ’s largest river , the @entity195 , which is less than half the length and far more shallow			0
the canyon was found after scientists analysed radar signals collected by @entity8 and researchers from the @entity194 and @entity201 over several decades			0
professor @entity202 , of @entity204 ’s @entity203 , said : ' with @entity205 available for many cities around the world and digital maps for everything from population density to happiness one might assume that the landscape of the @entity213 has been fully explored and mapped			0

scientists have created most detailed map to date of @entity5 's canyons
it reveals valleys below sea level which make glaciers prone to melting
other valleys shown to be deeper and wider than those in earlier maps
findings mean scenarios for @entity5 's melting ice need to be revised
melting from @entity5 currently accounts for around 10 *%* of sea level rise
