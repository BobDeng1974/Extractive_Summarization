by @entity1 reporter touts are asking up to £ 575 a ticket to this year ’s @entity4 amid huge demand to see @entity7 ’s first garden there since 1985			1
all 161,000 tickets to the world - famous event starting in @entity12 on may 20 have already gone , the second - fastest sell - out in its history			1
the ‘ @entity7 effect ’ has left gardening fans facing online prices of up to 25 times the face value of the cheapest £ 23 tickets			1
main attraction : this is the plan for @entity7 's @entity4 2014 garden charting his journey from his native @entity24 to the @entity25 , where he has a holiday home organisers from the @entity28 say that the ‘ @entity7 effect ’ has given the show a big boost			1
only last year ’s centenary show , when prince @entity32 was involved in a show garden , sold out slightly quicker			1
@entity28 spokeswoman @entity34 said : ‘ @entity7 is this year ’s @entity32 for us			1
‘ @entity7 is one of @entity37 ’s best loved gardeners and everyone is very excited about seeing his garden			1
’ after over 30 years fronting the @entity41 ’s @entity4 coverage , @entity7 chose to step aside this summer when he was demoted to a limited presenting role			1
winning man : @entity7 will return to @entity4 for the first time since 1985 his @entity4 garden ‘ from the @entity48 ’ charting his journey from his native @entity24 to the @entity25 , where he has a holiday home , is his first since winning a gold medal in 1985			1
@entity7 ’s ‘ joyous celebration of our flowers ’ will mark his 50 years as a professional gardener and the 50th anniversary of @entity37 in @entity52 , the annual contest run by the @entity28 for the country ’s most well - tended town			1
@entity28 director general @entity59 said : ‘ @entity7 is one of the most powerful forces in horticulture , reaching out to and promoting gardening to millions of people			2
‘ he has also been one of the biggest supporters of the @entity28 and , as this garden demonstrates , continues to generously support and promote horticultural campaigns that transform lives and reinforce our great position as a nation of gardeners			0
’ the face value of the cheapest @entity4 show tickets is £ 23 for evening entry , rising to £ 68 for all - day passes			1
but amid unprecedented demand , they are being offered on secondary ticketing website seatwave.com for up to £ 575 each			1
that price includes a £ 90 ‘ booking fee ’			2
similarly , tickets on rival site viagogo.com cost up to £ 550 each , including a £ 65 booking fee			2
the @entity28 is urging gardeners not to buy tickets from touts and warning anyone with tickets that turn out to be fakes will be denied entry			2
it is trying to deter people from turning to touts by offering special £ 400 charity tickets to support horticultural apprenticeships			2
ms @entity34 said : ‘ once again the cream of the gardening world , from leading designers to specialist nurseries , are creating content , which is so fantastically exciting and spectacular that @entity4 is a sell - out show			1
‘ as one of @entity37 ’s best loved gardeners , there ’s no doubt that @entity7 ’s return to create a garden with @entity107 , celebrating the 50th anniversary of @entity37 in @entity52 and his own 50 years in horticulture , has been an additional draw			1
‘ please can i urge people not be tempted to buy tickets from touts as you ca n’t be guaranteed that the tickets they are selling are authentic and you may be refused entry to the show			2
‘ instead of lining the pockets of ticket touts , 100 per cent of the funds raised from our £ 400 tickets will help to make a real difference to the future of horticulture and give people an amazing opportunity to start their career in one of the best industries in the world			1
‘ with a skills shortage in horticulture , not only will people be supporting a vital initiative but they ’ll get exclusive access to @entity4 and be able to enjoy the show after it has closed its gates to the public			1
’ @entity7 ’s 1,600 sq ft display will feature a drystone wall , moorland complete with heather , birch and pine trees and a stream in its @entity24 section			2
and there will be a beach hut and plants like sea kale that are native to the @entity37 seaside in the garden ’s coastal element			0
the @entity153 , seen here in 2002 with prince @entity155 , is set to visit @entity4 for the 50th time this year @entity7 has described actually creating a garden rather than presenting as the ‘ ultimate challenge ’			1
but he has been helped by award - winning professional garden designer @entity107 and does not face any potential embarrassment by being judged			0
since his is a special display commissioned by the @entity28 , of which @entity163 is vice president , his garden will not be formally judged			0
he said : ‘ i ’m rather relieved in a way that i ’m not having to compete for gold if i ’m absolutely honest			0
‘ but it ’s the people who judge it really			0
‘ so i ’m determined to build a garden that makes people say ‘ oh my goodness , look at that ’			0
that ’s the important thing			0
‘ i ’ve got to show i can do it now as well as present it			0
’ designer @entity177 , 54 , is favourite to make it a hattrick of ‘ @entity181 ’ awards with his @entity183 paradise - themed garden for investment house @entity184 after triumphing two years running			2
his 2013 winning design included stone sentinels holding up intricate iron gates that led onto an enormous 300 - year - old mill head mounted on a wall			0
