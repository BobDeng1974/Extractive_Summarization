@entity0 knew he could n’t finish @entity2 ’s final training session before the team flies out to @entity4 with a missed penalty			1
the @entity7 striker was one of four @entity9 players practising spot - kicks at end of a session open to fans at @entity15 ’s @entity14 but crashed his shot against the post with @entity18 watching on			1
there was a shake of the head , a tussle for the ball with @entity24 , then a successful strike from 12 yards by @entity26 to put him in a positive frame of mind ahead of the heightened pressure to come			1
not allowing that to happen ! @entity0 would n't leave @entity2 training without scoring a penalty what was that ? the @entity7 striker smashed an effort against the bar with @entity18 watching hitting the woodwork at the @entity38 is a rather different affair to this send - off in front of 5,000 or so @entity9 supporters happy to cheer and clap			1
there is a friendly against @entity44 in @entity45 on wednesday night first , before the flight to @entity47 on thursday , but this was a chance to give the @entity9 public a glimpse of what they can expect across the @entity54			2
@entity18 ’s likely starting @entity55 engaged in a game of eight versus three to stretch the defence in a manner similar to how @entity60 might			2
the teams face each other in their opening @entity38 game on june 13			0
@entity65 ’s @entity64 and @entity66 , of @entity67 , were pulled one way then the other by @entity26 , @entity69 , @entity70 and company ( including @entity73 ’s @entity72 ) in a crowd - pleasing drill that saw plenty of goals			1
@entity18 , on his way to @entity7 once the tournament is over , will deploy a 5 - 3 - 2 system in @entity4 with attacking wing - backs in @entity82 and @entity83			2
although @entity85 ’s @entity84 sat out he should soon be fit and is expected to play in that midfield trio behind @entity70 and @entity26			1
finish ! @entity26 was involved in quick drills with midfielders and forwards to yield plenty of goals on tuesday talking things through : @entity18 speaks with @entity73 's gangly central midfielder @entity72 relaxed attitude : the @entity2 players take a break after short , sharp intensive training drills could they all be in the @entity97 next year ? @entity83 ( left ) , @entity98 and @entity99 on tuesday means business : @entity26 stared straight down the lens for his official photograph in a quick passing routine the national captain looked sharp and well over his injury that restricted his playing time under @entity108			1
he will just hope there are no further penalty blemishes			0
meanwhile , @entity18 believes he has a happy camp as the @entity38 draws near - and he intends to keep it that way by winning			2
the @entity9 may have a reputation for attractive football but some of their previous tournament challenges have been undermined by infighting within the squad			2
@entity18 experienced such disharmony himself during his first unsuccessful stint as national boss , when @entity2 failed to qualify for the 2002 @entity38			1
the 62 - year - old is not sensing any problems this time round as his squad prepare to fly to @entity4 on thursday and he feels he has a duty to make sure that remains the case			0
@entity18 , who will take over as @entity7 manager after the @entity38 , said : ‘ it ’s also dependent on the management , it is not only the players			0
i think it is about the relationship between a manager and his squad			0
‘ in my first episode there was that ( disruption ) but i have understood now			0
‘ i feel there are not any problems			0
we have a very good relationship			0
‘ but it is also dependent on the results			0
at this moment we do n’t lose so much			0
’ hello ! @entity18 is primed to take over at @entity7 once the @entity38 has finished in @entity4 wrap him in cotton wool ! @entity70 is going to be a key figure for the @entity9 in the @entity149 stick together : @entity18 briefs the group of @entity9 players after their training session in @entity15			1

@entity26 , @entity69 , @entity70 all involved for the @entity9
@entity18 watched on intently on tuesday
@entity2 face @entity156 , @entity157 and the @entity158 in @entity149
