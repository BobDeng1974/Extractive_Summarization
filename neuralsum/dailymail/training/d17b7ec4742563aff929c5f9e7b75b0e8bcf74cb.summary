‘ my first conscious acquaintance with photography happened in 2003 when a 1.3 @entity63 digital simple hand - held camera appeared in my hands , ' @entity17 said			1
' i was highly impressed by the ability to view the results on the screen ! ' after that i became a fan of photography and gave it all my free time			1
' although i graduated from @entity72 with an honors degree in the sphere of @entity75 and i am still working at that sphere as a consultant , photography took my heart forever			1
’ @entity79 , business unit manager at @entity81 , who organise the contest , said : ‘ it ’s great to see such incredibly creative photography and the truly outstanding images that are entered each year in the @entity87			1
the overall winner of the @entity89 was @entity90 of the @entity91 with his stunning image of an intense storm over the @entity96 - @entity95 border , called @entity97 ¿ mr @entity90 said : ' i set up my camera with the lens manually at infinite focus , and zoomed all the way to the horizon			1
' if the storm had been any further away , my zoom would have given out			0
' i noticed the lightning bursts were every ten to twenty seconds			0
i used the ' bulb ' setting for manual shutter release and remotely began opening , counting to around twenty and then closing the shutter			0
any lightning caught in that time frame signaled me to stop the exposure and start another			0
the awards have produced a series of stunning images			1
the overall winner of the @entity89 was @entity90 of the @entity91 with his stunning image of an intense storm over the @entity96 - @entity95 border , called ‘ @entity97 ’			1

‘ every once in a while , i get away for a night by camping at one of my favorite quick getaway spots , ' said mr @entity90			0
' this night i decided to drive an hour to camp at a little group of sand dunes on the @entity95 - @entity96 border			0
' as i was driving , i did notice some small local thunderstorms forming in the distance			0
' this storm was not all that big , but it made up for it in intense electrical energy and light that was just incredible			1
’ ‘ i set up my camera but did not think that much would come of the images because most lightning photos in the past just lacked timing , shape , composition , and drama			2
' i was in luck , as this storm was highly concentrated so that the lightning was not all over the sky , but in a very specific area			0
after about an hour , the storm lost its gusto and disintegrated while others in the distance gained strength			0
