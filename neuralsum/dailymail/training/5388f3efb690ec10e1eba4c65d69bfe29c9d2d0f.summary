by @entity0 a toddler born with a rare joint condition is able to walk for the first time after wearing ' concrete trousers '			1
@entity5 had to wear an unusual double leg cast to fix a condition that caused one of his hips to be permanently dislocated			1
for the first six months of his life , the baby ’s legs had to be kept in an awkward shape in a harness , before being encased in the ‘ concrete trousers ’			1
@entity5 , had to wear the unusual double leg cast ( pictured left ) to cure his dysplasia - a condition that caused his hip to be permanently dislocated			1
after two operations and a long recovery , he can now run around ( pictured right ) like any other toddler doctors noticed a problem with @entity5 ’s hips just before his mother @entity28 , 33 , was due to take him home from hospital after his birth medics diagnosed the newborn with dysplasia , after his hip joint failed to form properly around the top of his leg , causing his right hip to constantly dislocate			1
at just four days old , @entity5 was placed in a full body harness that locked his hip into a fixed position			2
for nine out of ten dysplasis cases this is enough to solve the problem , but when @entity5 ’s hip failed to heal , doctors decided to operate placing his legs in a plaster cast at five weeks old			1
the procedure was found to have failed a week after it was performed and @entity5 had a second more invasive operation and a new cast fitted			2
for three and a half months , mrs @entity28 had to deal with the challenge of trying to change , dress and bathe a baby stuck in the unusual cast			2
doctors noticed the problem with @entity5 ’s hips shortly after his birth			1
at just four days old , he was placed in a full body harness that kept his hip locked into position , before being fitted with the cast ( pictured left ) he has now made a full recovery ( right ) mrs @entity28 ( pictured with husband @entity62 ) was at first apprehensive as to whether she and her husband @entity62 would be able to hold their baby with his new cast , but they were given advise from dysplasia charity steps about how to care for their son while he was in his plaster cast the new mother was at first apprehensive , worrying whether she and her husband @entity62 would be able to hold their baby with his new cast			1
they were advised by dysplasia charity steps , that they should not pick him up from under his arm pits because the cast was too heavy and instead were taught a new method of carrying their son around			1
after @entity5 ’s cast came off , mrs @entity28 was worried he would take longer than other children to reach the milestones of standing and walking			0
but at 14 months old , @entity5 took his first steps and now aged two , he is running around like any other boisterous toddler			1
mrs @entity28 , from @entity89 , said : ‘ it was such an unusual cast and it does n’t look comfortable at all so it was heart - breaking to know that my son had to be stuck like that for so long			2
‘ it ’s not a natural position and as a mum you just do n’t want your baby to be in pain			0
‘ the harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle			0
mrs @entity28 said : ' the harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle			0
then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers ( pictured )			2
they were so big and bulky and i was worried people would laugh at him ' ‘ and then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers			2
they were so big and bulky and i was worried people would laugh at him			0
’ she said her son 's diagnosis came as a shock after reading ‘ every single parenting book ’ when she was pregnant , finding no warning about hip dysplasia			2
at first , doctors thought both her son 's hips had fallen victim to the condition , before concluding it was just @entity5 's right hip was affected			1
‘ just before we were due to go home from the hospital , a doctor wiggled his hips around and told me that they were both dislocated , ' she said			0
at 14 months old , @entity5 took his first steps and now aged two , he is running around like any other boisterous toddler ‘ my husband @entity62 is a professional rugby player and has seen a fair few injuries in his time so i thought it would be just a case of clicking them back in			1
‘ but then they explained to me about hip dysplasia - it was a horrible sinking feeling			0
you could feel his hip click in and out			0
’ mrs @entity28 said that it was hard to imagine the cast before it was on her baby			0
‘ i just had all these questions about whether he was going to be in pain , whether i ’d be able to keep him clean and tidy			0
would i even be able to find him clothes big enough to fit over the cast ? ‘ but with all the help from steps we managed to deal with the “ concrete trousers ” situation and people were only sympathetic when we explained what was wrong			1
‘ once he finally got out of his cast it was such a feeling of relief			0
now you ’d never know that he ’d ever had a problem			0
’ @entity174 , ceo of steps said : ‘ steps receives calls from parents across the @entity177 who are upset at being asked by strangers “ how did you manage to break both their legs ? ” referring to their toddler who is in a hip spica cast from waist to ankles			1
‘ hip dysplasia is a common condition , but not common knowledge and we need to change this			0
‘ developmental dysplasia of the hip affects one to three per cent of all births in the @entity177 regardless of background - that ’s up to 24,000 children per year or an entire class in an every average secondary school			0
‘ it ’s more than the number of new diagnoses of leukaemia and skin cancer combined			0
