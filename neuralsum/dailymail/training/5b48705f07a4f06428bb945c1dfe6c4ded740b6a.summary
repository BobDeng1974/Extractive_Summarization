@entity0 has told wonderkid @entity1 that joining @entity2 would be an ideal next step in his remarkable rise to prominence			1
@entity6 revealed last week that he has not given up hope of luring his former prodigy from @entity9 – despite the 15 - year - old @entity11 midfielder being the most wanted youngster in @entity13			1
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are among those tracking @entity1 , who has also been linked with @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity1 is @entity11 's youngest ever player and has been scouted by @entity13 's biggest clubs @entity1 , 15 , has broken into the first team at his club @entity9 and is wanted by several top teams @entity0 , though , sees real merits in the teenager not jumping straight to one of the continent ’s elite clubs but instead continuing his development under a manager he trusts			1
it is a point he has made to his ex-stromsgodset team - mate , who is now also a colleague in @entity11 ’s national squad			2
‘ i ’ve talked a lot with @entity1 , ’ said fellow midfielder @entity0 , ahead of tonight ’s closing @entity35 group game against @entity37 in @entity38			1
‘ we keep in touch and speak on the phone			2
‘ i have told him that @entity2 can be a good choice for him			2
the way we play would suit him			2
we have the ball a lot and that ’s what @entity1 likes			1
he wants to be on the ball and creating chances			2
the @entity11 international has trained with @entity20 , @entity14 and @entity18 recently @entity1 is an attacking midfielder with an eye for goal , who @entity0 called an ' amazing talent ' ‘ @entity1 is an amazing talent and i hope he comes to @entity2			1
the gaffer has shown in @entity11 that he is very good with young players and he gives them a chance when they deserve it			0
@entity1 knows him and myself			1
‘ but it is up to @entity1			1
his father is a good guy who helps him a lot and he ’s also very mature in the way he thinks			0
i ’m sure he ’ll make the right decision for his career			0
’ he added : ‘ to say that you are going to go and play at @entity14 and compete against @entity69 and @entity70 and those guys … for a 15 - year - old that ’s going to be difficult			1
‘ he would be unlikely to play right away at a @entity14 or @entity15			2
of course it would be difficult			0
but , as i said , he needs to choose for himself			0
’ @entity0 , above training ahead of @entity2 's @entity35 tie , says he hopes @entity1 will come to @entity76 the @entity2 midfielder says his compatriot would fit in at the club , and might struggle to play elsewhere @entity0 admits he has been hugely impressed by the way @entity1 has coped with the incredible hype that surrounds him			1
‘ he ’s been at all the big clubs in @entity13 and it ’s probably the most insane thing i ’ve seen around a 15 - year - old boy , ’ he said			1
‘ everybody in @entity11 is talking about him			0
but he has handled it all			0
‘ he is very good , that ’s for sure			0
he ’s about to turn 16 but you can give him the ball and know he wo n’t lose it			0
he ’s creative , too			0
‘ he ’s young and will get stronger			0
give him one or two years and he will get there on the physical side			0
but on the ball , he is fantastic			0

teenage star @entity1 is wanted by @entity13 's top clubs
@entity1 has trained with @entity14 , @entity19 and @entity18
