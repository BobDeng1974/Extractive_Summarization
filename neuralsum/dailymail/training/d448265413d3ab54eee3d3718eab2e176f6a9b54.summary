admit it girls - just because you 've grown up , it does n't mean your girlish dreams have faded			0
i may be a 20 - something woman with my own home and career , but in my head i 'm still a @entity9 princess , convinced that a handsome prince is waiting to whisk me away to his castle , where we 'll live happily ever after … so this week i treated myself to a really girly beauty moment – i enlisted the help of pro make - up artist @entity15 to create a fun , colourful look inspired by @entity18 in the huge @entity9 movie @entity20			1
' so to give her @entity18 's icy skin i smoothed on @entity32 in a paler shade than she 'd usually use – it 's a gorgeous base that leaves your face looking flawlessly smooth and dewy			1
' fix in place with a dusting of loose powder – i swirled on @entity40 , using a big , soft brush			0
' step 2 : @entity43 @entity22 was joined by @entity44 star @entity15 to recreate the girly make - up ' all cartoon characters have huge , wide eyes – which makes @entity22 the perfect model for our princess , ' explains @entity15			1
' defining her brows with @entity52 adds emphasis to @entity22 's big , brown eyes			2
' next , i recreated @entity18 's shimmery pink eye make - up , first smoothing a baby pink shade from @entity59 's 5 @entity58 in @entity60 across her lids and up to her brow bone			1
' i then added a pop of colour using @entity65 in @entity66 to the centre of her lids , merging it into the pale pink			0
@entity15 recreated the wide @entity9 eyes with a dot of white eyeliner in the corners to make them appear larger ' a dot of bright white eyeshadow in the inner corners of the eyes is a clever make - up artist 's trick for opening up the eyes to achieve that wide - eyed cartoon look			1
' i completed the @entity18 effect with strong black eyeliner along the upper lash line around the outer corner of the lower lash line , using @entity88 in @entity89			2
finally , i added lashings of @entity91 by the brilliant @entity93 brand dhc			0
it lengthens and thickens lashes amazingly well , without clumping or flaking			0
' step 3 : @entity97 to complete the ' @entity98 ' @entity15 used thick black eyeliner to make @entity22 's eyes pop ' to give @entity22 the cartoonish effect of ultra-high cheekbones and apple cheeks i used @entity104 in @entity105			1
this shimmery pink powder comes in a wonderful heart - shaped box – just the thing for our girlishly romantic look – and its glistening sheen adds a gorgeous radiance to @entity22 's skin , ' explained @entity15			1
' finally , a slick of tinted lipgloss in a warm berry shade really pulls together all the pinks in this look			0
i used @entity119 in @entity120			0
' thanks @entity15 – you 've made me look as pretty as a princess			0
