it ’s a radical aircraft design that could one day see passengers flying in circles			2
@entity3 has filed a patent application for an unusual concept plane that has been dubbed a ‘ flying doughnut ’			2
instead of queuing on a jet bridge , passengers would board the @entity10 - like aircraft at ground level via an escalator and an ‘ access hatch ’ , and they would enjoy more space on flights			1
' flying doughnut ' : this drawing shows @entity3 ' concept for a new aircraft with a circular cabin passengers would board the @entity10 - like aircraft at ground level via an escalator and an ‘ access hatch ’ the futuristic plane has a circular cabin with curved aisles and a hole in the middle , giving it the shape of a doughnut			1
passengers in economy would be seated in the outer ring , while business seating would be located within the inner ring			0
the unconventional aircraft , shaped like a @entity39 , would be lighter and have more cabin space for travellers while solving a long - standing problem related to cabin pressure			2
according to a 15 - page patent application filed late last month , the concept plane would be free from the stress that cabin pressure places on cylindrical aircraft , meaning it would be more economic and efficient			1
the plane has a circular cabin with curved aisles and a hole in the middle , giving it the shape of a doughnut conventional planes have sealed bottoms with heavy fasteners to withstand the loads induced by cabin pressurisation			1
in its patent filing , the @entity61 - based manufacturer wrote : ‘ the present invention proposes an aircraft wherein the structure delimiting passenger cabin extends over 360 degrees around a space defined outside structure			0
‘ the invention allows structure to be more resistant to loads induced by the cabin pressurization , while allowing to reduce or even to avoid the need for a sealed bottom			0
’ @entity3 spokesman @entity73 told @entity74 that the design may never be in production as the company files over 600 patent applications every year			0
he said : ‘ some of these become the seed for other ideas with practical use			0
’ @entity3 has come out with a number of futuristic concepts , including a virtual reality isolation helmet the @entity61 - based manufacturer has patented a design for benches with bicycle - like saddle seats @entity3 , which manufactures the @entity88 , the world ’s largest passenger plane , has patented a number of futuristic concepts that may never materialise			1
one of them is a virtual reality isolation helmet , which looks like a prop from a @entity96 film			1
with comfort in mind it would cancel out peripheral noise – including crying children or chatty adults – and allow passengers to immerse themselves in in - flight entertainment			0
each headset would come with a built - in video screen , glasses for better viewing , earphones and a mini-airbag to protect the head during extreme turbulence			0
other concepts include windowless cockpits , benches with bicycle - like saddle seats and an external audio system that would mimic bird noises to prevent bird strikes .			2
