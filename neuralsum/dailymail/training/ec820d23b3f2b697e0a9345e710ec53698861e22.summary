by @entity0 ' useful and funny ' : the cover of the new 2014 @entity3 publication which was released on tuesday brace yourselves for a freezing winter			1
at least , that is according to the @entity3			2
the 222 - year - old periodical , which is believed to be the oldest continuously published periodical in the @entity8 , has predicted ' colder - than - average temperatures ' this winter with ' higher - than - average snowfall '			1
the @entity12 , @entity13 - based almanac , which released its 2014 edition today , says a drop in solar activity and a change in ocean patterns are the reasons behind the cooler temperatures			2
‘ this winter will bring bitter cold and heavy snow across most of the @entity8 , ’ says the publication , which dubs itself as ' useful , with a pleasant degree of humour '			1
it says the cold weather will affect every region of the @entity8 except for the lower @entity29 , the upper @entity30 and the northern states of the @entity32			0
‘ sweaters and snow shovels should be unpacked early and kept close by throughout the season , ’ said @entity33 , editor of the annual periodical			1
shovel time : the @entity3 editor , @entity33 , says ' sweaters and shovels should be unpacked early ' this year @entity42 winter : the periodical suggests people should ' gather your jackets ' to brace for the extreme temperatures @entity48 fun : there will be enough of the white stuff to keep any child occupied this winter success rate : the publication claims its predictions are correct based on its forecast for last year 's winter cause of chaos : a drop in solar activity and a change in ocean patterns will be the cause of the extreme temperatures , according to the periodical the @entity3 has also predicted the country will experience a warmer , drier spring with above - average temperatures			1
it warns that drought will be a ‘ problem ’ during summer in several areas , such as the southern tip of @entity71 ; from @entity73 westward through the @entity74 and @entity30 ; from @entity75 and @entity76 westward through the @entity77 ; and in the upper @entity72			2
the periodical also claims there will be more rainfall than normal with an ‘ active hurricane season ’			0
it predicts a major hurricane will make landfall on the central @entity84 in july and several hurricanes and tropical storms will threaten @entity71 and the @entity87 in september next year			1
@entity88 season : the publication predicts several tropical storms will threaten the country in september same , same : the @entity92 , which is 197 years old , has predicted a winter outlook for 2014 much the same as its older cousin 's last month , the @entity95 - based @entity92 , which has been published for 197 years , said much the same			1
however , some scientists have refuted the two periodicals ' meteorologic assessments			0
@entity100 meteorologist @entity99 said that the @entity92 makes forecasts , which are so vague that it is difficult to assess whether they are accurate or not			0
in a report published on the university 's news website , mr @entity99 states : ' the ability to predict events that far in advance is zero			0
there 's no proven skill , there 's no technique that 's agreed upon in science to be able to do that			0
in its bicentennial edition , the @entity116 stated , ' neither we nor anyone else has as yet gained sufficient insight into the mysteries of the universe to predict weather with anything resembling total accuracy			0
' however , according to the new 2014 edition of the @entity3 , their forecast for last year ’s winter was ‘ nearly perfect ’			1
‘ we were correct in our forecast temperature change from the previous winter in 15 of the 16 regions – yielding an accuracy rate greater than 94 per cent			2
’ and therefore , @entity3 leaves its advice , as a chilling reminder : ‘ gather your jackets and light up a fire ! it is going to be cold outside ! ’			0
