a @entity1 street has a new sign to properly honour @entity3 , a @entity4 medal winner , after officials got his name wrong his heroism in @entity8 was honoured with a @entity4 and earned his name a place in the military history books			1
@entity11 , then 21 , risked his life dashing across open ground under heavy fire to rescue his wounded commanding officer , who also won the @entity4 that same day , during a fierce battle with the @entity17 in @entity18 , now modern day @entity19 , in 1917			1
but despite being his home town @entity1 ’s only winner of @entity24 ’s highest award for gallantry , bungling officials got his name wrong when a new road was named after him in 2000 - by putting up a sign reading @entity28			1
his great nephew @entity29 spotted the error - @entity30 was his middle name but he was always known as @entity3 or @entity32 - when he visited the @entity34 town for the unveiling of a commemorative blue plaque at his brave relative ’s childhood home nearby eight years ago			1
he contacted a local historian who branded the mix - up ‘ shameful ’ and a campaign was launched for a new , correct sign			2
a battle of a different sort then followed – as residents objected to the ‘ inconvenience ’ of having to re-register their details with utility companies and banks if the road name was changed			1
after renewed pressure to see @entity53 ’ memory properly honoured in the centenary year of the outbreak of the 1914 - 18 war , a new , larger sign will finally be officially unveiled today - but the road will still be called @entity28			1
in smaller writing below , however , an explanatory panel adds : ‘ commemorating @entity1 - born capt. @entity61 , 1895 - 1968			1
awarded the @entity4 during the @entity8			1
’ yesterday dr @entity29 , 70 , a retired chartered electrical engineer , of @entity62 , said : ‘ i was a bit disturbed when i saw the old sign for the first time			2
but i ’m more than happy now - the new sign is unusual , you do n’t normally see one with an explanation underneath			0
’ local historian @entity69 , who led the campaign backed by local @entity71 , said : ‘ it was shameful they got his name wrong			1
naming a road after someone is meant to be an honour , but that was more of a dishonour			1
it ’s terrific a compromise has been reached			2
’ captain @entity3 was serving with the 13th @entity89 when he won his vc			0
at the time he was a lieutenant			0
he survived the war , married twice , had three children and worked for the @entity92			0
he had moved to @entity93 , @entity94 , by the time of his death aged 73 in 1968			0
after renewed pressure to see @entity53 ’ memory properly honoured in the centenary year of the outbreak of the 1914 - 18 war , a new , larger sign will finally be officially unveiled today - but the road will still be called @entity28 after the idea of changing the road ’s name was proposed , 85 per cent of the street ’s residents opposed it when surveyed			1
@entity108 , 71 , a retired nurse who has lived in the road since the houses were built in 2000 , said : ‘ it would ’ve caused so much trouble , with insurance , utilities , everything having to change , and so many people you would have to get in touch with			2
‘ you ’d have all the problems of moving house , without actually going anywhere			0
‘ if they ’d suggested it when we first came here maybe it would have been a bit different			0
but after 14 years it ’s a bit much			2
none of us knew who @entity3 was when we came here , which is no surprise if that was n’t his real name			0
‘ i ’m happy with the new sign			0
it explains who he was , and we keep our address			0
’ street names can be suggested by the developer of a new street , but are ultimately chosen by councillors in the relevant ward , who take it in turns , in @entity1			1
@entity146 claim they have no idea how the mistake was made in the first place or who originally put forward the name @entity28			0
a well - placed source said : ‘ we have no records on it or why ‘ @entity3 ’ was chosen , but it must have been after @entity53			0
‘ the positive thing is that if it had been called @entity158 from day one most people still would n’t have known who he was or why he ’s important			2

@entity11 , then 21 , risked his life to save his *comrades* in @entity8
he is @entity1 ’s only winner of @entity24 ’s highest award for gallantry
but bungling officials got his name wrong when road was named after him
