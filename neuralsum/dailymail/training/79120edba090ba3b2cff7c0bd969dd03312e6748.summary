being the butt of the jokes at a stand - up comedy night is a terrifying prospect for pretty much anyone , even a size eight blonde model			2
but when you 're trying to cover up a size 22 figure ( 26 @entity10 ) , the effect is mortifying			2
for @entity12 , 29 , from @entity13 , the experience was to make completely overhaul her diet			1
the dental nurse decided to start dieting after she was the butt of a comedian 's jokes during a stand - up show she said : ' i was at a comedy show with my mates when the comedian started telling jokes about fat girls and decided to single me out			1
' " here ’s one ! " he laughed , pointing at me , sitting in the second row			2
' suddenly all eyes were on me and the laughter grew louder - my night out had turned into a nightmare			2
' " take no notice			2
he ’s an idiot , " my friend whispered , but i was already starting to cry and the brave face i ’d worn for a lifetime finally slipped			2
' @entity12 had always been big - even at school she was a size 20 ( 16 @entity10 ) , which made her the daily target of bullies			1
as a teenager , @entity12 had dreaded being invited to theme park outings in case she was too big to go on some of the rides , even though she was just 5ft 6ins tall			1
at @entity12 's heaviest , she weighed 18st 5lbs ( 259lbs ) but by the time @entity12 reached adulthood , she had found a nice group of friends and a job as a dental nurse that finally made her feel comfortable and confident			1
until that night in the comedy club			2
she said : ' that night shattered me			2
from then on , all i wanted was to lose weight			0
' so i embarked on a starvation diet – the only way i knew to lose weight – and within a few months i ’d gone from 17st ( 238lbs ) to 13st ( 182lbs ) , then gained it all back again			0
' the ‘ diet / binge ’ cycle lasted nearly 10 years and left me at 18st ( 252lbs ) - bigger than i ’d started and utterly miserable			1
since losing the weight , @entity12 has dyed her hair blonde and gained in confidence ' when my boyfriend @entity65 , proposed in 2010 , i lost 4st ( 56lbs ) for the wedding and felt pretty good in my size - 16 wedding dress			1
' two weeks later , after a honeymoon to @entity70 , i was already 1st heavier and within two months that dress no longer fitted			0
' @entity12 when she reached her goal weight , with her @entity74 leader @entity73 @entity12 's disgust at her weight started to impact on her social life , because she was too embarrassed to be seen in public			1
she said : ' i no longer wanted to go out and i avoided shopping for anything except food			0
i lived on junk food , ready meals and takeaways			0
' my skin was spotty and i had absolutely no energy , the result of a pretty appalling diet			0
' breakfast was biscuits and coffee when i arrived at the dental surgery where i work			1
' mid-morning , i ’d buy a pasty to keep me going , then for lunch i ’d have a cheese baguette , crisps , chocolate and a sugary fizzy drink			0
' after work , i got in the habit of eating four or five slices of toast , then when @entity65 came home i ’d take something out of the freezer for our tea , like a pizza , potato wedges or fried chicken			0
' i ’d convinced myself that working full - time meant i had no time to cook			1
' @entity12 continued : ' the only time i ate vegetables was when we went to my mum ’s for sunday lunch			1
' at christmas 2012 , @entity65 bought me some beautiful , expensive jeans and tops in a size 22 and none of them fitted			0
' i had no idea what i weighed – years of dieting had given me such a fear of the scales that i no longer owned any – but i was absolutely gutted			0
' a week later , @entity12 signed up to her local @entity74 group in @entity13			1
she said : ' i stepped on the scales and my leader , @entity73 , asked if i wanted to know the number			0
@entity12 hated to go out socialising when she was at her largest , preferring to stay in and watch television ‘ " yes , i want to face it , " i replied , and when she told me i was 18st 5lb ( 259lbs ) , i was horrified , but not surprised			1
' over the next few months @entity12 completely overhauled her diet			1
breakfast was a poached egg on toast and for lunch she took salads or soups to work , with a piece of fruit for a snack			0
then for dinner she would have a @entity74 ready meal with salad and cooked vegetables			0
in the first month she lost 1st 7lb ( 23.8lbs ) and could fit into the clothes she was given for @entity149			0
@entity12 then started to learn to cook and signed up to a gym - by the end of february she had lost another 7lb			1
she said : ' each week i continued losing weight and by the summer , i was down to 13st 6lb ( 190lbs )			0
@entity12 appears in the dec / @entity155 issue of @entity156 ' by the winter , i was a size 14 - i had n’t been that slim since i was about 12 years old and i started taking more interest in my appearance , like having my dark hair lightened was a big step			1
' i went on to lose another 7lb and now i ’m maintaining my weight between 9st 7lb and 10st ( 140 lbs )			2
' breakfast is a big bowl of fruit with @entity74 yogurt , lunch is a chicken or tuna salad and a packet of crisps			0
' @entity173 on fruit and in the evening i make a low @entity176 value meal for the two of us			0
' on holiday this year in @entity179 , i wore my first ever bikini – in a size 10 – and , although i still felt a little unsure of myself , @entity65 told me i looked great			1
' the other day , one of my patients came into the dental surgery and asked , ‘ where ’s @entity12 ? ’ when i said , ‘ that ’s me , ’ he shook his head			1
‘ no , the other @entity12			1
the big girl with the dark hair			0
’ ' i had to smile , because i ’m no longer dark , i ’m no longer big and i ’m no longer the girl who wears a permanent brave face … but i ’m still me			0
