@entity14 : cleaners at the @entity1 are being housed ten to a room at a huge temporary compound , pictured			2
the campsite in @entity5 , hidden from public view , has 25 people sharing each toilet and 75 to each shower and the bad weather has left the site flooded with stagnant water , forcing them to use abandoned crates as makeshift ‘ stepping stones ’ to move around the site			1
hundreds have come from abroad to work at the @entity28 despite promises that the jobs would go to @entity31			0
on arrival , some were horrified to be told there was no work for two weeks			0
but despite this , they were made to pay the cleaning company £ 18 a day in ‘ rent ’ to sleep in the overcrowded metal cabins , which works out at more than £ 550 a month			1
others who had come to the @entity41 desperate for the jobs turned back , describing the camp as ‘ horrible ’ , with showers and toilets ‘ filthy ’ from over-use			1
poor conditions : the bad weather has left the site flooded with stagnant water , forcing the cleaners to use abandoned crates as makeshift ' stepping stones ' to move around the site			1
this image shows how close the camp is to the @entity55 @entity56 , 21 , a student from @entity57 , said : ‘ i could n’t believe it when i saw the places people were sleeping			2
‘ when i first saw the metal gates and the tall tower in the middle , it reminded me of a prison camp			0
' i was thinking i would apply for a job , but i have changed my mind			0
my two friends signed up , but i think they are regretting it			0
’ cleaners at the camp have signed gagging orders preventing them from talking to the press and have been banned from having family and friends visit ‘ for security reasons ’			1
one worker , from @entity80 , said conditions were ‘ very bad ’ inside the camp but he had nowhere else to live			1
‘ it is like a slum inside , ’ the 24 - year - old said			1
‘ the toilets are dirty and the space is very little			0
’ another , also from @entity80 , said : ‘ when we saw the camp , we were shocked			1
when we came to @entity90 we thought accommodation would be much nicer			0
employment : hundreds of people have come from abroad to work at the @entity1 ‘ some of the cabins have been leaking and we have been told to fix them ourselves			1
two girls have left already because they did not want to sleep in a room with men they did n’t know			1
’ plans for the accommodation were backed by @entity103 organiser @entity102 and waved through by the local council , @entity105 , even though environmental health officers said the toilet and shower facilities were ‘ unlikely to be adequate ’ , while landscape architects said the sleeping arrangements were ‘ cramped ’			1
troops serving in @entity113 could face extended tours of duty because of the @entity28 security fiasco , it is feared			0
some 3,500 service personnel men and women have been drafted in urgently for guard duties at the @entity120 , potentially delaying battlefield training they would receive before deploying to @entity113			0
as a result , troops in @entity123 are braced to spend an extra month there , although the @entity126 denied there would be a knock - on effect on tours of duty			0
but councillors decided that because the camp would be only temporary , concerns about the housing and welfare of the workers were not ‘ justifiable reasons for refusing planning permission ’			1
any accommodation where more than two adults have to share a room is considered ‘ overcrowded ’ under housing laws			2
health and safety guidelines state that employers should provide at least five toilets and five washbasins for every 100 people			0
@entity148 , of @entity149 which runs the camp , said the number of toilets and showers per person exceeded requirements for temporary accommodation and that there were internet , medical and entertainment facilities on - site			0
he said shift patterns would reduce pressure on the facilities			0
he said unexpected heavy rain had been a ‘ pain ’ but the company was working tirelessly to sort things out			1
messy : some who had come to the @entity41 desperate for the jobs turned back , describing the camp as ' horrible ' , with showers and toilets ' filthy ' from over-use he added : ‘ this is not a prison			0
nobody is forced to stay there			0
many of our staff have come from areas where there is extremely high unemployment and are very happy to be working in the @entity120			0
‘ there will always be a couple of disgruntled people on site , but it ’s a shame they did n’t come to talk to us to air their grievances because there are certainly processes in place for them to do that			2
’ a @entity102 spokesman said : ‘ @entity195 [ part of @entity149 ] have assured us that the accommodation they are providing their workers is of a suitable standard			2
’ plush : the conditions at the cleaners ' camp are in stark contrast to the @entity207 where the athletes will stay luxurious : athletes in the @entity207 will have access to a nice bar area complete with comfy armchairs and games workers fit out the container city in @entity216 with mattresses ready for the contract @entity28 staff machinery is used to lift the heavy bedding to the upper level of the container housing so the rooms can be kitted out			2
