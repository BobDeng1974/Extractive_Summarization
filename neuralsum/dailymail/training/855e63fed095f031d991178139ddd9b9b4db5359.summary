by @entity0 a scaffolding firm has been hit with a £ 5,000 fine after photographs emerged of a worker dangling his legs over the edge of one of its dangerous structures			2
@entity8 risked the lives of its workers and passers - by on a busy central @entity13 street by failing to secure boards on their five - storey platforms and not setting up safety rails			1
the @entity13 - based company was carrying out work on @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity13 - where pedestrians were so concerned they took pictures of the precariously - perched workers and sent them to safety authorities			1
dangling : health and safety authorities were sent this picture of a worker precariously perched on top of a five - storey - high scaffolding when the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) received the images they investigated the company , and found the work was ' poorly planned ' and that two of the workers were untrained			1
@entity31 said the pictures , take on june 20 last year , showed workers using unsecure and ' precariously balanced ' boards to pass materials to higher levels			2
they also showed a worker sitting near the top of the five storey structure , casually dangling his legs over the side			0
@entity48 , of @entity49 , @entity13 , was fined £ 5,000 and ordered to pay £ 734 in costs after pleading guilty at @entity51 to two breaches of the work at height regulations 2005			1
after the hearing , @entity31 inspector @entity55 said : ' scaffolding work is fraught with risk and can be extremely dangerous if it is n't carried out properly			0
' the standards here were sorely lacking and the photographic evidence speaks for itself in terms of the risks taken			2
concern : a member of the public took these photographs showing the scaffolding - which inspectors said was ' sorely lacking ' in safety features ' none of the missing measures , such as guard rails and secured boards and ladders , were difficult to provide , and there was no excuse			1
' it is n't just the workers themselves who could end up getting seriously hurt or killed			0
' people should be able to walk along a pavement without having to worry about a piece of scaffold slipping from the hands of an overhead worker			0
' thankfully nobody was injured , but that does n't detract from @entity89 failing to ensure the work at height was properly planned , managed and executed in a safe manner			0
' i would like to thank the concerned member of the public who brought the matter to our attention and who provided such clear visual evidence ' .			0
