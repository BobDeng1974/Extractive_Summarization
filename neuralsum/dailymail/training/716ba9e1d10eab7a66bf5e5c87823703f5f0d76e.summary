captain @entity11 said the bullets entered the toilet door below the shoulder level of @entity1 , if he were standing without prosthetic limbs			2
@entity1 has always maintained he was on his stumps when he fired			2
prosecutors do not dispute the assertion , after initially alleging he was on his prosthetic limbs when he fired a total of four shots , three of which hit 29 - year - old ms @entity16			2
captain @entity11 said that only one of the four shots ricocheted inside the lavatory , hitting the wall twice and breaking the tiles			0
but he said the other three bullets ' disappeared somewhere between the door and the wall , ' adding that he believed that had hit the ' target ' straight away			0
it is believed ms @entity16 was by the toilet in the bathroom when she was killed , but it has not yet been established during the trial whether she was sitting down on it			0
captain @entity11 said he used thin rods and the beam from a laser mounted on a tripod to try to determine the trajectory of the bullets through the door			0
he also described entry and exit wounds on ms @entity16 's right arm and her head , and bruises on her chest where a ' projectile ' struck without penetrating			1
