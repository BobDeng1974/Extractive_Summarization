by @entity0 last updated at 8:20 pm on 7th december 2011 a protein that plays a major role in tumour spread could pave the way to new cancer treatments , research suggests			1
in laboratory tests , scientists showed that blocking the protein , periostin , prevented the formation of secondary cancers			1
rather than focusing on cancer cells themselves , the researchers in @entity14 looked at the environment around tumours			1
preventative : scientists found that the protein , periostin stopped the formation of secondary cancers			1
picture of a human cancer cell they found several conditions necessary for ' metastatic ' - or spreading - cancer to propagate			2
' in particular , we were able to isolate a protein , periostin , in the niches where metastases develop , ' said study leader dr @entity34 , from the @entity35 in @entity36			1
' without this protein , the cancer stem cell can not initiate metastasis ; instead , it disappears or remains dormant			2
' the research is published today in an early online edition of the journal @entity43			0
@entity44 exists naturally in the ' extracellular matrix ' , the connective tissue filling the gaps between cells			0
it has been shown to play a role in foetal development			0
in adults , it is only active in specific parts of the body such as the mammary glands , bones , skin and intestine			0
deadly : most cancer deaths are caused by ' metastatic ' spread to vital organs such as the liver or brain the scientists showed that mice bred to lack periostin avoided metastatic cancer			1
they went on to develop an antibody that attaches to the protein , rendering it dysfunctional			2
' we are hoping in this way to be able to block the process of metastasis formation , ' said dr @entity34			2
very few side effects were seen in the treated mice , but dr @entity34 cautioned : ' this does n't necessarily mean the same will hold true in humans			0
' we 're not even sure that we 'll be able to find an equivalent antibody that will work in humans			0
' most cancer deaths are caused by metastatic spread to vital organs such as the liver or brain .			0
