we all know and love the moon			0
we 're so assured that we only have one that we do n't even give it a specific name			0
but the moon is not the @entity7 's only natural satellite			2
as recently as 1997 , we discovered that another body , @entity9 , is what 's called a quasi-orbital satellite of @entity7			1
now researchers believe its strange orbit may help scientists better understand how gravity helped planets form			1
this could provide an ideal testing ground for our understanding of how the solar system evolves under gravity @entity9 does n't loop around the @entity7 in a nice ellipse in the same way as the moon , or indeed the artificial satellites we loft into orbit			1
instead , @entity9 scuttles around the inner solar system in what 's called a ' horseshoe ' orbit			1
to help understand why it 's called a horseshoe orbit , imagine we 're looking down at the solar system , rotating at the same rate as the @entity7 goes round the sun. from our viewpoint , the @entity7 looks stationary			1
a body on a simple horseshoe orbit around the @entity7 moves toward it , then turns round and moves away			1
once it 's moved so far away it 's approaching @entity7 from the other side , it turns around and moves away again			2
horseshoe orbits are quite common for moons in the solar system			1
@entity54 has a couple of moons in this configuration , for instance			0
@entity9 , a 3 mile ( 5km ) asteroid ( animations shown above ) is shown here			2
the yellow orbit in the animation shows @entity9 's orbit around @entity7 what 's unique about @entity9 is how it wobbles and sways along its horseshoe			1
if you look at @entity9 's motion in the solar system , it makes a messy ring around @entity7 's orbit , swinging so wide that it comes into the neighbourhood of both @entity75 and @entity76			1
so what can we learn about the solar system from @entity9 ? quite a lot			1
like the many other asteroids and comets , it contains forensic evidence about how the planets were assembled			1
its kooky orbit is an ideal testing ground for our understanding of how the solar system evolves under gravity			1
it was n't until the end of the 20th century that we even realised that bodies would enter such weird horseshoe orbits and stay there for such a long time			2
the fact they do shows us that such interactions will have occurred while the solar system was forming			1
the moon has been orbiting @entity7 for more than four billion years			0
but our planet ’s faithful companion may not be alone			0
a new object , dubbed 2014 @entity104 , has been found masquerading as @entity7 ’s ‘ second moon ’			0
the new ‘ moon ’ , which is in fact a 490ft ( 150 metre ) asteroid , takes about a year to orbit the sun and is close enough to @entity7 to look like its satellite			2
the peculiar object was accidentally discovered on july 29 by astronomer @entity113 of the @entity114 of @entity115			0
according to @entity116 writing in @entity117 , 2014 @entity104 has been travelling near to our planet for about 775 years and it will continue to do so for another 165 years			0
it has an elliptical orbit and takes around 364.92 days to circle the sun once , meaning the asteroid and @entity7 are in ‘ resonant orbits ’			2
this happens when two orbiting bodies exert a gravitational influence on each other due to their orbits being closely related			0
asteroid 2014 @entity104 orbits the sun in a similar timeframe to @entity7 , but our planet ’s gravity pushes it into an eccentric wobble			0
because we think terrestrial planets grow via collisions of bodies of @entity9 - size and above , this is a big new variable			2
one day , @entity9 could be a practice site for landing humans on asteroids , and perhaps even mining them for the rare - earth metals our new technologies desperately crave			2
if @entity9 struck the @entity7 , though , that would be an extinction - level event , similar to what is believed to have occurred at the end of the @entity150 period			2
luckily it 's not going to hit us anytime soon – its orbit is tilted out of the plane of the solar system , and astrophysicists have shown using simulations that while it can come quite close , it is extremely unlikely to hit us			1
the point where it is predicted to get closest is about 2,750 years away			0
if you look at @entity9 's motion in the solar system , it makes a messy ring around @entity7 's orbit , swinging so wide that it comes into the neighbourhood of both @entity75 ( pictured ) and @entity76 @entity9 is expected to undergo a rather close encounter with @entity75 in about 8,000 years , however			1
there 's a good chance that that will put paid to our erstwhile spare moon , flinging it out of harm 's way , and out of the @entity177 family			0
the story does n't end there			0
like a good foster home , the @entity7 plays host to many wayward lumps of rock looking for a gravitational well to hang around near			0
astronomers have actually detected several other quasi-orbital satellites that belong to the @entity7 , all here for a little while before caroming on to pastures new			0
@entity9 and these other satellites teach us that the solar system is n't eternal – and by extension , neither are we			1

@entity9 was *spotted* in 1997 and is known as a ' quasi-orbital satellite '
this is because it moves around inner solar system in ' horseshoe ' orbit
it contains forensic evidence about how the planets were assembled
its unusual orbit is also an ideal testing ground for our understanding of how the solar system developed under gravity
