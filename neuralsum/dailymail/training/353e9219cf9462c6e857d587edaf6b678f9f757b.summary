by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 1:42 pm on 18th july 2011 two more suspected victims of the hospital insulin poisoner were named yesterday as the deadly speed with which the drug could have been used as a murder weapon became clear			2
great - grandfather @entity7 , 84 , and 71 - year - old @entity9 are feared to have died as a result of the sabotaged saline solution that is also suspected to have killed @entity12 , 44			1
yesterday their families were coming to terms with the fact that their loved ones ’ sudden and unexpected deterioration after being admitted to @entity18 in @entity19 could have been down to a twisted poisoner intent on mass murder			2
contamination victims : @entity9 , 71 , left , from @entity19 , left , and @entity7 , 84 , right , both had their medication tampered with last night detectives were continuing to interview around 60 medical staff who could have had access to the store room between wards @entity30 and @entity31 where 36 vials of saline solution are believed to have been deliberately contaminated with insulin			1
the hospital contacted police last tuesday after a nurse reported a higher - than - normal number of patients with ‘ unexplained ’ low blood - sugar levels			1
fourteen patients are thought to have received overdoses , and the 11 survivors are to be interviewed by detectives once they have recovered in the hope that they can provide clues			1
victim : @entity12 died following the deliberate contamination of saline solution at @entity18 in @entity19 other deaths that could be linked to insulin poisoning at the hospital are to be referred to the local coroner , and detectives are prepared to widen their inquiry to dozens of potential murders going back weeks or even months			1
mr keep , a widower from @entity58 , near @entity19 , who was suffering from lung cancer , was admitted to the hospital on june 27 after breaking his hip in a fall			0
he successfully underwent surgery , but in the following days his blood pressure and blood - sugar levels dropped , and doctors diagnosed fluid on his lungs			0
it is thought the insulin with which the saline had been contaminated may have been undermining his health , undetected by medical staff			1
at the start of last week his family were told he was too weak to continue receiving treatment , and he died last thursday			1
shortly afterwards police broke the news that he could have been poisoned			2
his daughter @entity79 , 59 , said yesterday : ‘ i keep putting it to the back of my mind , that there has n’t been foul play with my father			0
i just keep hoping that is the case			0
’ mr @entity9 , who never married and lived in sheltered housing in @entity88 , @entity89 , died last monday			1
his family , thought to be restricted to an elderly sister , was too upset to comment yesterday			0
the deadly effectiveness of an insulin overdose – if it is proved to have been used as a murder weapon – is demonstrated by the speed with which @entity95 , the first known victim , deteriorated			0
the mother of two had suffered from a severe form of multiple sclerosis for 12 years , and her family were used to regular hospital visits			0
devastated : @entity101 , the brother of @entity12 , said police visited his parent 's home after her death and said the funeral would have to be cancelled her ageing parents , @entity108 and june , went to @entity18 to visit her after she was admitted on thursday , july 7 with a suspected chest infection , leaving her at 4pm feeling reassured that ‘ colour was coming back into her cheeks ’			1
yet barely an hour and a half later , they received a call saying she had taken a severe turn for the worse			0
they live just half an hour way , but by the time they returned to the hospital , she was dead			0
her family were initially told she had died of a chest infection associated with her @entity125 , but after the alarm was raised on the ward where she had been treated , they found themselves at the centre of a potential murder investigation			2
inquests into the deaths are expected to be opened this week by @entity134 , the coroner who has admitted he was duped by @entity135 , @entity136 ’s worst medical serial killer , who murdered more than 200 people .			0

@entity7 , 84 , @entity9 , 71 and @entity12 , 44 , all died after medication was contaminated
police interview 11 patients who survived effects of tampered medication
