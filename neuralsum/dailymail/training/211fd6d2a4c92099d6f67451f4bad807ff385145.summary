@entity0 closes in on @entity1 after throwing his 500th touchdown pass during the @entity4 ' rout of the @entity5 the best part of @entity0 's big day was getting to share the spotlight with some of his best friends			1
@entity0 joined @entity1 in the @entity12 's most exclusive of clubs with his 500th touchdown toss on sunday when the @entity4 handed the @entity5 their first loss , 41 - 20			1
the @entity4 star has now thrown 503 touchdown passes , five short of @entity1 's record of 508 ' football is the ultimate team game , and so i guess one man has to accept it and i really accept it on behalf of a lot of coaches and teammates , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 threw for 479 yards and four tds , moving him within five of @entity1 's record 508			1
after getting his milestone touchdown — a 7 - yard dart to tight end @entity30 — out of the way early , @entity0 helped @entity32 and @entity33 make history , too			1
@entity32 set a franchise record with 226 yards on eight catches , beating @entity38 's mark of 214 yards set against @entity39 in 2002			1
@entity33 's seven receptions moved him past @entity41 for the most catches in @entity12 history by an undrafted player			1
he has 854 , five more than @entity41 caught for @entity4 between 1995 - 2006			1
' i still ca n't believe he was undrafted because that man can play some ball , ' @entity32 said			1
@entity33 's record - breaker came on the last play on the first half , something @entity0 called ' kind of a ha - ha moment for scouting , for not drafting him			1
so , whoever was a general manager in 2004 , those guys ought to send him an apology letter			2
' @entity32 caught touchdown passes of 31 and 86 yards , and his 77 - yard td was nullified on a chop block by @entity30 that sent defensive end @entity61 from the game with a right knee injury			1
left tackle @entity64 was engaged with @entity61 and was whistled for the flag			2
but it was the @entity67 tight end who crashed low into @entity61 and drew the wrath of @entity71 coach @entity70			0
' i 've been coaching for 37 years , it 's the dirtiest play i 've seen , ' @entity70 fumed			2
' it was a flat chop block and put him out of the game			0
i know @entity76 , great coach and great guy			0
somebody has got to answer to that			0
a fine is n't going to do it , when he 's going to miss three or four weeks , on a blatant chop block			2
' @entity61 's strained mcl added to a miserable afternoon in which the @entity5 ( 3 - 1 ) surrendered 568 yards , the most they 've allowed since 1973 , and saw fill - in quarterback @entity85 leave with a concussion			1
the @entity4 ' offensive output was their best in franchise history			1
they had 567 yards against @entity91 in 2004			2
@entity0 's 500th td throw came in his 244th career regular season game , 49 fewer games than it took @entity1			1
it came against two of his mentors : @entity70 , who was his first qb coach in 1998 , and @entity5 assistant head coach @entity100 , who was his offensive coordinator during his 13 seasons in @entity102			1
@entity103 43 - 17 @entity104 @entity105 and the @entity103 routed the @entity104 and quieted the doubters			0
the three - time @entity108 winner finally looked like a quarterback who has thrown for 50,000 yards in his career as @entity111 dominated the @entity12 's last unbeaten team , beating @entity113 43 - 17 sunday night			1
just six days earlier , the @entity103 lost to the @entity114 41 - 14 , unleashing criticism that @entity105 had regressed and lacked talented teammates to help him			0
" it 's hard to be oblivious to things			2
we all have tvs or the internet or the questions i get and the emails that i get from people that are concerned , " @entity105 said after throwing for two touchdowns and no interceptions			0
" nobody died or anything			0
it 's just a loss and i think we 've always done a great job putting losses behind us quickly			2
" @entity105 did it in 2003 when the @entity103 lost the opener to @entity135 31 - 0 , then beat @entity136 in the next game 31 - 10 and went on to their second @entity108 win in three years			0
sunday 's win had special significance for @entity105 , as he became the sixth quarterback to pass the 50,000 - yard mark			1
" it 's awesome , " he said			2
@entity105 threw for a 292 yards after not passing for more than 249 in his first four games , and @entity144 had 113 of the team 's 220 yards rushing against a team that had allowed an @entity12 - low 11 points per game			1
the @entity103 ( 3 - 2 ) surpassed that by scoring on their first two possessions on @entity144 's 1 - yard run and @entity105 's 17 - yard pass to @entity152			1
they led 20 - 3 at halftime before the @entity104 ( 3 - 1 ) cut it to 10 points on @entity158 's 37 - yard pass to @entity159			1
bills 17 - 14 @entity161 @entity160 kicker @entity162 responded to an alleged laser pointer shining from the stands in @entity165 with laser - point accuracy			0
after banking a 50 - yard attempt off the left upright in the third quarter , @entity162 split the goal posts from 58 yards with 4 seconds left for a 17 - 14 come - from - behind victory over the @entity161 on sunday			2
" i hit it really good			0
it was one of those things i really like to not leave opportunities like that short , " said @entity162			0
" i hit the ball really well , a lot better than i did on the 50 - yarder			0
" and this time , there was n't a laser shining in holder @entity181 's face , as apparently happened on the earlier miss. the @entity160 filed a complaint with @entity12 security officials after both @entity181 and quarterback @entity185 said that someone in the stands was shining a laser pointer at them			1
without going into detail , coach @entity189 said the issue was resolved before the game ended			0
in fact , @entity189 said , the laser was less of a distraction than it was a motivator			0
" we felt that @entity162 could do it , " @entity189 said			0
" at that point , with the adrenaline and everything , he was fired up			0
" @entity12 spokesman @entity201 said the league was waiting for its security representative in @entity165 to file a game report			1
the @entity161 said in a statement that they were aware of the reports and contacted @entity12 security regarding the issue			1
the @entity160 ( 3 - 2 ) snapped a two - game skid in @entity185 's debut as @entity135 's starter after @entity212 was benched this week			2
and their defense had six sacks in delivering coordinator @entity215 a win in his return to @entity165 after being fired as @entity161 head coach last season			0
the @entity161 were undone by placekicking			0
@entity221 missed all three field goals attempts , including a 50 - yarder that sailed wide left with 21 seconds remaining			0
coach @entity223 was already hinting of being ready to make another switch at kicker two weeks after @entity221 was signed to replace rookie @entity226			2
" it 's a performance - based league , plain and simple , and you have to perform , " @entity223 said			2
" anyone that does n't , we take a look and see if we can improve that one way or another			0
" the @entity161 ( 3 - 2 ) squandered a 14 - 0 lead , dropped to 2 - 1 at home and also lost several key regulars to injury			0
receiver @entity238 did not return after aggravating a right ankle injury in the first minute of the third quarter			0
starting running back @entity241 did n't finish the game after also hurting his ankle .			0
