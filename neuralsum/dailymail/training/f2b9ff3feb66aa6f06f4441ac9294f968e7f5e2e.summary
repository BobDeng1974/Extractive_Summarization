by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will have to personally fork out £ 2million if he wants a move to @entity4			2
the @entity6 boss is among chairman @entity8 's top candidates to replace @entity9 after he was relieved of his duties at @entity11 this week			1
@entity2 has been credited with turning @entity6 into one of the @entity14 's most attractive sides to watch			0
in the frame : @entity6 manager @entity2 is a wanted man by @entity4 he 's gone ! @entity9 was relieved of his duties at @entity11 earlier this week the @entity16 has a year left on his current deal at @entity18 's and will have to pay the huge figure because of a clause in his contract			1
@entity8 has already made checks on @entity25 boss @entity24 , but @entity2 's stock in @entity27 continues to rise			1
the 42 - year - old is highly thought of after guiding @entity6 to eighth this season while allowing @entity30 and @entity31 to flourish			2
there is a slight rebuilding job to be done in north @entity34 this summer after @entity36 ' £ 107m transfer splurge last year failed to pay off			0
record signing £ 30m @entity38 , @entity40 centre back @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 - all signed before this indifferent campaign - are subjects of interest from abroad			0
it means any incoming manager will have the opportunity to mould their own squad - something @entity2 would relish given the potential outgoings at @entity6			0
@entity31 and @entity30 appear geared to leave the south coast , with a number of other stars courted by @entity14 rivals			0
having a look : chairman @entity8 has a raft of potential candidates to take over ahead of next season making things happen : @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 have flourished under @entity2 's guidance			1

@entity2 will have to pay out of his own *pocket* if he wants @entity4 move
@entity6 boss is one of top candidates to replace @entity9
@entity25 coach @entity24 is also on the *shortlist*
@entity2 's stars @entity30 and @entity31 are leaving @entity6
