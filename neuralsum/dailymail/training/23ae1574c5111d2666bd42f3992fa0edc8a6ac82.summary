by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:05 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 06:27 est , 14 september 2012 @entity2 today performed some fancy footwork to side step complaints from senior @entity5 that he is getting too close to @entity6			1
the ballroom dancing business secretary is under growing pressure to explain why he has been in talks with @entity6 leader @entity12 while serving in a @entity13 led by @entity15 @entity14			1
mr @entity2 's aides have dismissed the idea that he is preparing to cross the political dancefloor , saying : ‘ @entity2 is not looking for a new partner			1
but today mr @entity2 insisted he was behaving in a ‘ reasonably adult way ’ and had ‘ nothing to be embarrassed about ’			2

' @entity2 tipped ' very athletic ' olympic cyclist @entity44 to win the new series of @entity23 the @entity47 - winning cyclist has insisted she is not feeling the pressure of taking part in the @entity51 dance show			1
but mr @entity2 was put on the spot to explain why he has been trying to tango with mr @entity12			0
mr @entity2 was an advisor to @entity6 's @entity54 before joining the @entity5			1
while unveiling his overhaul of employment law today , @entity2 had only one thing on his mind : his friday dance lesson			1
' i like ballroom and @entity62 , ' he told @entity41 's @entity40			1
' after tipping ' very competitive … very athletic ' @entity44 for success in the new series of @entity23 , he confessed : ' i have got my own dancing lesson this afternoon			1
' rules on impartiality meant he could not take part in the full @entity23 series			2
but in december 2010 he was allowed to compete in the @entity73 special , partnered with ballroom professional @entity74 , pictured above the pair performed the @entity77 and the foxtrot			2
playing down his @entity6 links today , he said he made contact ‘ very , very occasionally ’			2
' i ’ve said this many times before , i think in politics you have to have a reasonably adult way of dealing with people			0
' i very , very occasionally talk to @entity12 and sometimes his people and , indeed , people across the spectrum			0
‘ it does n’t matter , there ’s nothing to be embarrassed about , for him or for me , i talk to people across the political spectrum , i think that ’s what politics involves , being grown up , not being tribal			2
' i do n’t feel remotely embarrassed about that			0
’ but sir @entity26 disagrees , telling the @entity101 magazine - which is circulated to @entity102 - yesterday : ‘ the success of this @entity104 depends upon everyone who participates in it being a full subscriber			0
' i do n’t think it helps a partnership to suggest that you may already be looking for another partner			0
’ mr @entity2 revealed he was off to a dance lesson this afternoon , but not before unveiling plans to make it easier for company bosses to get rid of under - performing staff			1
the shake - up of employment laws will cut how much compensation workers can win in unfair dismissal cases but @entity15 - backed ‘ fire at will ’ reforms have been abandoned			1
mr @entity2 told @entity40 : ‘ we are trying to have it both ways because we do want the best of both worlds , we want to have confidence in business that they can hire people			0
' but we want people to go to work knowing that at the end of the day , if they have a very bad relationship , they do have some basic labour rights and protection			0
’ the limit on unfair dismissal payouts will be reduced to a maximum of 12 months ' salary or set at an even lower figure			0
pick a partner : @entity2 has defended contacting @entity12 ( left ) while working with @entity14 ( right ) in coalition @entity2 and @entity6 's @entity144 were accused of a ' love - in ' after they appeared together on @entity51 1 's @entity146 and the current £ 72,300 cap on pay - offs will also be cut significantly in the hope of encouraging small businesses to start hiring more staff			1
@entity152 , @entity6 ’s shadow business secretary , said : ‘ ministers should be making it easier to hire , not easier to fire people			1
' we are in a double dip recession due to this government 's failed economic policies , not because of the protections people have at work			0
instead of adopting a credible plan for growth , this government is attacking rights of every employee in this country			0
‘ sacrificing people 's rights at work is not the way to bolster consumer confidence and get our economy moving again			0
’ sir @entity26 ( right ) has warned @entity2 against ' looking for another partner ' while in coalition with the @entity33 also among the reforms are plans to giving judges powers to sift through tribunal cases before they reach court to allow them to dismiss weak cases without the need for a hearing			1
@entity187 general secretary @entity186 said : ' reducing payouts for unfair dismissals will let bad employers off lightly and deter victims from pursuing genuine cases			0
