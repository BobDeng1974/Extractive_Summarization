obviously , it is still just golf			2
and there ’s nothing wrong with that			2
except of course , it ’s not			2
the @entity7 makes golf feel like so much more than just a game			1
and you ’d be hard pressed to find a more engrossing sporting event with which to fill up a corner of your front room over a long weekend			1
which is something @entity15 clearly decided they were really going to embrace on the @entity7 ’s trip to this side of the @entity18			1
they even created a unique channel for the tournament			1
the @entity23 team pose with the @entity7 trophy after their 16.5 - 11.5 triumph over the @entity26 @entity27 sprays the champagne after @entity23 's victory is confirmed at @entity30 the weekend 's spectacle was enjoyed by all in attendance at @entity30 and million watching on @entity15 @entity33 hit @entity7 winner having this much time to play with afforded them time to digress from the action			1
this certainly came in the shape of the @entity7 concert which featured an array of music of which you could at least say , well , @entity44 , he ’s @entity46 ! but it meant nothing to me , @entity50			1
where was the golf theme ? i ’d have opened with @entity53 , followed by @entity54			2
then @entity55 for the finale			2
‘ @entity58 , @entity59 , you come and go ’			1
would have brought the house down , no ? there was also the golf equivalent of @entity15 ’s cricket autopsy show , the verdict			1
although , @entity65 with @entity66 and @entity67 could n't quite generate that show ’s sparks in their re-living of the day ’s play			1
and their attempt to do a little comedy skit about the @entity26 uniforms was , shall we say , not really part of their skill set			1
but these are just a couple of nibbles amongst what was a quite magnificent spread of action			0
all set off by the real star of the show for me , the @entity30 course itself			1
a massive part of making golf so appealing as a tv sport for anyone other than the truly devoted is the backdrop			2
@entity15 pundits @entity95 ( left ) and @entity59 ( second right ) wave from their studio overlooking the first tee as @entity99 ( right ) looks on the @entity7 concert in @entity101 was spectacular but did n't have a golf theme the beautiful @entity30 course attracted thousands of spectators over the three days of competition the masters , with its dazzling light and rich array of bright colours , is a prime example			1
but the sumptuous shades of green - splattered with rainbow - coloured flower beds of fans - that made up @entity30 ’ pallet were just as captivating			1
that , and the @entity117 - like skies that the players were frequently launching the ball into			2
when she ’s really on her game , she delivers ! the @entity123 , the merrier			0
so once you ’ve been handed a setting on a plate , it is then down to the telly to deliver			0
this i thought happened in swathes across the weekend			0
including - and i know it may be a bit fancy , too ‘ techy ’ for the purist - the bright graphic ribbon that accompanied so many of the drives			2
instructive , and it looked great slicing its way through the sombre array of silvers and greys of the skyline			0
having said that , the money shot of the whole weekend , for me , was the aerial view of the 9th tee			2
capturing the drive from the side rather than behind , this needed no computer wizardry			0
all that was required was the ball to fly across the rich tapestry of the @entity30 course			1
spectators on the 16th hole were able to enjoy some spectacular scenery as they watched the action @entity23 captain @entity159 is shown on the big screen against a spectacular backdrop then there was a bunch of fellas playing a few rounds of golf			1
their contribution was set up perfectly on the morning of day three from @entity15 ’ excellent fishtank of a studio			1
@entity99 and @entity171 for the blues , with @entity95 and @entity173 on the red side , were engrossing in their analysis of what had gone , and what was yet to come			1
and all that with a burgeoning crowd in the background already roused into song			0
lest we forget , though , the first couple of days were none too shoddy			0
@entity185 summed it up beautifully in commentary on saturday when he spoke of ‘ that illusive snake oil : momentum ’			0
this was followed by @entity171 at his most prophetic , saying he hoped a holed putt by @entity192 would ‘ get ( him ) into @entity7 mode ’			1
it was n’t too much later that the chip in on the 15th had poults celebrating in time honoured style			0
but perhaps best of all was an intimate moment , captured casually on mic , which gave us a welcome insight into the business end of this tournament			0
@entity27 had just launched a beauty from the 9th			0
and just like your mate might if you were having a sneaky nine on your local course , @entity207 muttered ‘ great drive , that ’			0
@entity59 takes time out from his @entity15 punditry duties to take part in the @entity214 @entity173 , also working as a @entity15 pundit , shakes hands with @entity27 on the first tee @entity59 and @entity99 take a peek out of the @entity15 studio as the action unfolds @entity221 touches a picture of @entity223 for luck as he walks to the first tee day three is a different animal , though			1
it ’s the concept of going ' mano a mano ' , but with a whole team , indeed continent , behind you			0
and it had the pictures to match			0
not many people are going to forget @entity26 rookie @entity235 ’s sssshing of the crowd and @entity238 impressions			1
nor the indomitable @entity239 , having played his miracle shot from under a tree , turning to the camera and saying ‘ a bit of @entity223 for you ’			0
and of course the maelstrom of pictures that resulted from @entity248 ’s incredible approach on the 15th			0
but perhaps the most vivid of them all for me went back to the players ’ winding walks down to the first tee , when @entity255 touched fists with the image of @entity223			2
and @entity258 left his fellow countryman a little kiss on the cheek			0
@entity262 succeeded in delivering ‘ sport event tv ’ at its grandest			0
but in those couple of intimate moments , we witnessed its true spirit .			0

@entity15 devoted a whole channel to their @entity7 *coverage* as @entity23 defeated the @entity26 16.5 - 11.5 at @entity30
their ' fishtank ' studio was in the perfect place next to the first tee
pundits @entity59 , @entity99 , @entity173 and @entity95 was engrossing in their analysis
but the @entity7 concert in @entity101 was a little *unnecessary*
the picturesque @entity30 course was a real star of the show
