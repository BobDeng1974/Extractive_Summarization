@entity29 says the @entity33 company will use a third - party organization to help part - time workers find insurance alternatives : ' we are trying to balance the needs of ( workers ) as well as the costs of ( workers ) as well as the cost to @entity0			1
' @entity0 made $ 17billion in profits last year , according to @entity44			2
the @entity46 family , who founded @entity3 's largest retailer , are @entity3 's richest family with a combined fortune of $ 140billion			1
they still hold 50 per cent ownership of the company , according to @entity52			0

@entity0 , which employs about 1.4 million full - and part - time @entity3 workers , says about 1.2 million @entity0 workers and family members combined now participate in its health care plan			1

the company announced today that it will no longer provide health care for part - time workers ' retailers who offer part - time benefits are more of an exception than the rule , ' says @entity95 , director of research for health and benefits at @entity77			1

@entity0 , like most big companies , also is increasing premiums , or out - of - pocket costs that employees pay , to counter rising health care costs			0
@entity0 said that it 's raising premiums for all of its full - time workers : for a basic plan , of which 40 percent of its workers are enrolled , the premiums will go up to $ 21.90 per pay period , up from $ 18.40 , starting january 1			1
@entity0 also said that changes in the co-insurance , or the percentage workers pay before coverage kicks in , for the health reimbursement accounts and the health savings accounts will result in the company paying 75 per cent of the eligible costs of doctor visits , tests , hospitalization and other services within the network after employees meet their deductible			2
