by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:45 est , 18 february 2014 a heartbroken couple fear they may never be able to return to their home after a massive sink hole threatened to swallow it up			2
two other houses also had to be evacuated after the massive 25ft - wide crater opened up in the street			2
@entity12 and his wife @entity13 returned to their property as fears grew that part of the structure could collapse			1
the area around the property in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , was cordoned off as engineers prepared to check on the property 's safety			1
he said : ' i got home and put the key into the back door but the door would n't open			1
' i thought it was weird and then i noticed a crack in the patio and when i looked up the house wall was cracked as well			1
' the couple believe the danger is so great that they may never be able to set foot back in their home again			2
mrs @entity63 , 60 , said : ' we are heartbroken			0
' terrifying : the sinkhole has undermined the foundations and caused the partial collapse of the house risk : the @entity70 has said that the most susceptible area in the @entity72 for sinkholes is the @entity75 gypsum deposits of north - east @entity76 , particularly around @entity22 , where this house is located no - one has been hurt in the incident which is believed to have been caused by a sink hole , the sixth such incident in @entity72 in recent weeks			1
a @entity83 spokeswoman said a dog was rescued from cracks in the property by fire crews			0
the hole appeared just days after a proposal to build 75 homes on nearby abandoned auction mart site was rejected by councillors due to subsidence fears			1
planning officers at @entity95 had recommended approval for the scheme by @entity98			0
' heartbroken ' : @entity12 , pictured with his wife @entity13 ( left ) and ( right ) showing the strain , fears he may never be able to return to their damaged property distraught : @entity12 and @entity63 leave their home after examining the damage caused by the sinkhole under their house but the mayor of @entity22 , councillor @entity111 , urged members to reject the plans because of the risk of gypsum subsidence causing ground instability			1
he said : ' my main concern is the stability			0
i urge you to throw out this application as there is insufficient evidence that development can be safe			0
' why has there been no development on the site for the past 300 years ? could it be that our ancestors knew it was unstable ? ' i do n't think any development should take place on that site because it is unsafe for building			2
i do n't think any insurer is going to insure any of those houses built at that site			2
' the @entity70 has said that @entity22 is one of the most susceptible areas in the @entity72 for sinkholes because of the gypsum deposits there			1
it says large sinkholes have developed around @entity22 , some of which have affected property and infrastructure			1
' weird ' : @entity12 said he only noticed the huge crack down the side of his house when he could n't get his back door to open assessing the damage : officials look over a neighbouring wall near the properties which have been evacuated alert : one of the neighbouring houses which was one of three properties evacuated by police while engineers inspected the damage caused by the sinkhole in the area hidden danger : a graphic explaining why some areas are more susceptible to sinkholes than others this is because gypsum is far more soluble than limestone , and thus dissolves more rapidly			1
@entity172 is just a few hundred yards from @entity174 , where a massive sink hole appeared in 1997			1
that hole which had been known about since @entity177 was said to have been the inspiration for the illustrations in @entity181 's @entity180			2
the young girl used as the model for the drawings used to live in a house across the @entity186 from where the latest sink hole has appeared			1
meanwhile , two more sinkholes have appeared about a mile from the hole that opened up on the @entity191 in @entity192 , local resident @entity188 said			1
recurring theme : these two sinkholes have appeared about a mile from the hole that opened up on the @entity191 in @entity192 last week the two holes opened up in the past three weeks about 500 yards apart on farmland between @entity198 and @entity199			1
one sinkhole is about 9ft deep and the other about 10ft deep			0
highways contractor mr @entity188 , 55 , said : ' one of them looks like a giant footprint			2
' the first one appeared three weeks ago			2
as i was walking with my wife , we went to look at another spot where one had opened up before and , sure enough , another one was there			0
' the interesting aspect to this is that these have appeared about a mile from the @entity215 where one occurred , and they will keep opening up			2
' sinkholes are an ' ongoing feature of the landscape ' and the country is likely to see more as the ground is set to remain saturated for some time , according to a geology expert			2
the that opened up beneath a 100 - year - old detached house in @entity226 in @entity22 , @entity23 , yesterday , was the latest in a spate of sinkholes			1
it came after a 35ft ( 10.7m ) wide and 20ft ( 6.1m ) deep one opened up under homes in a quiet cul - de - sac in @entity233 , @entity234 , on saturday morning			1
dangerous : a 50ft - deep hole appeared in the central reservation on a section of the @entity215 in north @entity192 last week and last week a stretch of the @entity215 in north @entity192 was closed after a 15ft ( 4.6m ) deep hole was discovered in the central reservation , while on february 2 a teenager 's car was swallowed up when a 30ft ( 9.1m ) deep crater appeared in a family 's driveway in @entity246 , @entity247			1
a range of factors - natural and man - induced - can trigger sinkhole collapse , and heavy rain or surface flooding are considered to be examples of triggers			0
leaking drainage pipes , burst water mains , irrigation , or even the act of emptying a swimming pool , are also examples			0
@entity263 , from the @entity70 , said : ' the ground is saturated at the moment , in certain parts of the country , and where it 's saturated , it will remain saturated for some weeks , if not months			0
' and gradually the situation will improve , but in the short term i suspect there will be more of these incidents being reported			0
' gone : a @entity273 was swallowed up by this sink hole in @entity246 , @entity247 brand new : @entity275 , 19 , was given a replacement after the car was engulfed by the hole which developed outside her home ms @entity263 said that while there has been a spate of sinkholes this month , she remembers a similar spate around 1987 when she was working in @entity284 - during a period which was also ' very wet '			1
' you may or may not have seen that a bus actually sunk into one of these cavities , ' she said			0
ms @entity263 said she fears that increased knowledge about sinkholes is worrying people			2
' i fear that people are becoming worried because we 're increasing their awareness of the occurrence of these things			0
these cavities have existed for as long as we have been developing			0
they pre-date humans , ' she said			0
ms @entity263 said sinkholes are known about and so there are guidelines for building and construction to prevent building on areas of land where there may be problems in the ground			0
' we try to avoid them during construction , or we take adequate measures to stabilise them , ' she said			0
risk : @entity319 feared she would have to pay around Â£ 10,000 after a sinkhole twice the height of a double - decker bus appeared in her garden in @entity324 , @entity326 - @entity325 concern : a 35ft wide hole appeared underneath a home in @entity233 last week , prompting the surrounding properties to be evacuated ms @entity263 said it is necessary that people are aware of potential sinkholes so that they can ' manage the situation around them '			1
' we know they 're an ongoing feature of the landscape , ' she said			0
and she added : ' there is definitely a direct link between the infiltration of surface water and the likelihood of these occurring			0
' looking ahead , ms @entity344 said : ' i think we will see some more incidents over the coming months			0
i think we will have some reported to us here			0
' they may not be of the scale that hit the headlines			0
' the @entity70 has said that the most susceptible area in the @entity72 for sinkholes is the @entity75 gypsum deposits of north - east @entity76 , particularly around @entity22			1
it says large sinkholes have developed around @entity22 , some of which have affected property and infrastructure			1
this is because gypsum is far more soluble than limestone , and thus dissolves more rapidly			0
and local residents said there was a long - standing problem with gypsum - related subsidence in the area which had caused other homes to collapse over the years .			1

three properties evacuated after huge crack appeared down the side of @entity13 and @entity12 's house
mr @entity12 , 61 , noticed the crack when his back door would n't open after returning to his house in @entity22
hole appeared just days after plans to build homes on a nearby site were rejected over fears of subsidence
a number of sinkholes have also emerged in @entity192 , @entity326 - @entity325 and @entity233 in recent days
