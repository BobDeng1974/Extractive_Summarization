@entity0 is being sued for £ 200million following the collapse of a joint venture with former @entity4 ceo @entity3 sir @entity0 and his @entity5 is being sued for £ 200million by the former chief executive of @entity7 over plans by the @entity10 billionaire to launch his own luxury cruise line			1
the lawsuit has been filed by @entity3 in @entity13 , and claims that @entity5 muscled him out of a joint venture to break into the industry with massive ships capable of carrying 4,200 passengers each and operating as floating resorts			1
@entity3 alleges he presented a plan to @entity5 in 2011 to launch a new cruise line focused on two ' ultra ships ' that would give it a foothold in the hard - to - enter but highly profitable luxury cruise industry , according to the complaint			1
sir @entity0 and the @entity5 first looked at the cruise market in the late 1970s , ' and our current team has been exploring the opportunity for more than a decade , ' @entity5 said in an emailed statement on wednesday			2
' over the years , we have been in discussions with a number of parties including the plaintiff , and those discussions ceased in 2012			0
we strongly believe the claim has no merits			2
' virgin in december announced the formation of @entity41 , which intends to sail out of @entity42			0
it 's one of the newest of sir @entity0 's numerous business ventures , which include airlines , the @entity47 spacecraft , a music label , book publishing , a travel agency , hotels and mobile phone services			0
as ceo of the new @entity54 hired @entity55 , former president of the @entity56 , a unit of @entity57 according to the lawsuit , the plan was initially brought to @entity5 by @entity3 , who after analysing the cruise industry concluded that a well - known brand such as @entity5 could break into the business profitably by building a pair of so - called ' ultra ' ships			1
these vessels , such as @entity67 's ' @entity69 ' ship , feature a wide array of on - board attractions and command premium prices			0
@entity0 announced in december his intention to form @entity41 , that sail out of @entity42 , @entity74 ( file photo ) the may 2011 agreement between @entity5 and @entity3 estimated that @entity5 could make between $ 427 million and $ 483 million in profits over 10 years if the venture performed as planned			1
under this deal , @entity3 would get nothing if the ships were not profitable but stood to make $ 315 million if his projections were met			0
' upon recognizing the potential for @entity41 to be one of @entity5 's ' biggest , sexiest businesses , ' however , the dark side of @entity5 quickly emerged , ' the filing says , citing language used by @entity0 in a video shot in 2012			0
@entity3 claimed that @entity5 later began altering the deal to diminish his earnings and leave him as ' an indentured servant whose ownership and rewards depended completely upon @entity5 's whims			2

lawsuit has been filed by former @entity98 cruises boss @entity3
he alleges that after presenting cruise plans , he was ' muscled out '
@entity5 say they ' strongly believe the claim has no merits '
