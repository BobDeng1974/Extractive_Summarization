' when mrs @entity26 fell pregnant with @entity3 , she was due the second week of january 2010			1

' bundle of joy : @entity3 when she made her arrival into the world on christmas day in 2009 with mother @entity7 special present : scarlett born on christmas day last year but when mrs @entity3 , who lives in @entity37 with husband @entity8 , 38 , who runs his own security firm , was 12 weeks pregnant , the baby 's head was already engaged			1
she said : ' the midwife told me that the baby could well come early , and she may even make an appearance at @entity19			1
i was surprised , but i imagined that it would be after @entity19 , perhaps @entity44 at the earliest			1
' mrs @entity45 went to bed on @entity47 but in the early hours of the morning she awoke as her waters broke			0
mr @entity49 drove her to hospital where they told her that delivery was still a long way off and to come back on @entity54			0
she said : ' when i got home i was in a lot of pain and the contractions were getting stronger			0
but the doctors had told me it would be the following day when i would finally give birth			0

pictured with mother @entity7 , 30 ' by the middle of the afternoon the pain was so intense i could n't cope with it anymore and i begged @entity8 to drive me back to hospital			1
' so the couple returned to @entity70 and less than three hours later , at 6.50pm she gave birth to @entity3 , weighing a healthy @entity73			1
she said : ' the midwife told me she had always wanted to deliver a @entity19 baby			1
i was still in shock			0
i could n't believe i 'd delivered her on christmas day			0
she was nearly four weeks early , but luckily she was still healthy			0
' i was worried about her being born on @entity19 but @entity8 and i both vowed that she would n't miss out on attention simply because her birthday was on december 25th			1
' when @entity3 had reached her second birthday , the couple decided to try for another baby			1
mrs @entity3 said : ' we were aiming for a summer baby this time			1
one @entity19 baby was enough for us			2
' but in april last year she discovered she was pregnant again - and this time her due date was 28th december			0
she said : ' i thought the sonographer was joking when she told us the date			0
both @entity8 and i were so shocked			0
no - one else could believe it either			0
all the family and friends were joking that we would have another @entity19 baby			2
' when i told @entity3 we were having another baby she was so excited			2
she asked whether it could come on her birthday and be a present for her			2
i never imagined that she would be getting the present she asked for this year			0
' two weeks before @entity19 , mrs @entity26 started with mild contractions - but doctors told her that they could continue for weeks			2
she said : ' i tried to put it to the back of my mind and carry on with the @entity19 preparations			2
i had to hope that this baby would hang on until after @entity19 and arrive when she was supposed to do			2
' but at nearly midnight on @entity47 , her contractions got stronger and in the early hours of @entity19 morning , mrs @entity3 was on her way to @entity109			1
she said : ' @entity8 and i just could n't believe that we were going to hospital for a second time on christmas day			0
' @entity4 was born at 7.17am - weighing a healthy @entity113			2
mrs @entity3 added : ' the midwife was so excited as it was the first @entity19 baby she had ever delivered			1
when i told her it was our second , she could n't believe it			0
we were the talk of the hospital			0
' now @entity4 is due to celebrate her first birthday and older sister @entity3 will celebrate her fourth birthday this @entity19			1
mrs @entity3 said : i 've tried to keep it separate for them this year , and they had their parties a few days before @entity19			1
we have to do that - or else none of their friends can come			0
who wants to come to a birthday party on christmas day ! ' but the day will be very special			2
i 'm glad my daughters share a birthday			2
