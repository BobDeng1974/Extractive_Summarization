mr @entity1 , 80 , has been investigated in the past over assisted suicide – an offence carrying a 14 - year jail sentence – but has never been arrested			1

the decision of a dementia sufferer to use @entity4 will alarm right - to - life and disability campaigners because of the implication that those with @entity35 ’s or similar conditions should consider killing themselves			1
the individual is said to be at an early stage of dementia and to have a report from a psychiatrist asserting that he is mentally competent to choose to kill himself			0
dr @entity45 , of pressure group @entity46 , said once euthanasia was legalised in any circumstances ‘ you inevitably end up widening the category of people to be included			0

‘ the desire to stop being a burden on one ’s family and to avoid squandering financial resources perhaps better spent on grandchildren ’s further education could become the final altruistic gesture , especially when combined with a wish to stop prolonging a life that is both futile and very unpleasant			0
’ mr @entity1 has acknowledged both that he has assisted in a number of suicides and that the people involved were strangers			2
these are factors which should ‘ tend in favour of prosecution ’ , according to guidelines laid down by @entity98 @entity97			0
