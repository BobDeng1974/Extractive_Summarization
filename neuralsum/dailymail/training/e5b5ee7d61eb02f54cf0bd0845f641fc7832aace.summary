@entity1 spies employed ' dirty tricks ' including ' honey traps ' to trap nations , hackers , terror groups , suspected criminals and arms dealers , according to leaked documents			1
the bombshell revelations have been made public through the release of documents taken from the @entity13 by whistle - blower @entity14			1
the @entity16 slides outline techniques apparently used by the @entity18 and @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , a @entity1 spy unit whose goal is to ' destroy , deny , degrade [ and ] disrupt ' enemies			1
@entity1 spies employed ' dirty tricks ' including honey traps ' in a bid to trap nations , hackers , terror groups , suspected criminals and arms dealers the slides from 2010 and 2012 , published by @entity32 show that the @entity20 completed their mission by ' discrediting ' adversaries through misinformation and hacking their communications			1
two main methods of attack detailed in the ' effects ' campaigns are cyber operations and propaganda campaigns			2
the bombshell revelations have been made public through the release of documents taken from the @entity13 by whistleblower @entity14 @entity20 , which is part of the @entity13 ’s @entity1 counterpart , the cyber spy agency known as @entity47 , used @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 for deception , mass messaging and ' pushing stories '			1
another strategy is ' false flag ' operations - this is when @entity1 agents carry out online actions that are designed to look like they were performed by one of @entity1 ’s adversaries			2
the main cyber attack is the ‘ distributed denial of service ’ ( @entity65 ) attack			2
this is when computers are taken over by hackers and they bombard a website ’s host computers with requests for information causing it to crash - this is a method successfully used by @entity76 hackers			2
earlier this week it was revealed that @entity20 agents issued their @entity65 on @entity80 chat rooms , preventing its users from communicating with one another			2
in one case , reported the @entity84 , agents are said to have tricked a hacker nicknamed @entity87 who claimed to have stolen data from the @entity91 government			2
they did this by sending him a link to a @entity84 article entitled : ' who loves the hacktivists ? ' @entity99 , an attorney who currently teaches it law at the @entity101 , told @entity32 it is ' remarkable ' that the @entity47 has become so adept at launching @entity65 attacks without ' clear lawful authority , ' particularly because the @entity1 government has criticised similar strategies used by other governments			0
' @entity47 has no clear authority to send a virus or conduct cyber-attacks , ' he said			0
' @entity110 is one of the most invasive methods of surveillance			0
' according to notes on the 2012 documents , a computer virus called @entity115 was ' used in a variety of different areas ' and was ' very effective			1
' when sent to adversaries , says the presentation , the virus will ' encrypt itself , delete all emails , encrypt all files , make [ the ] screen shake ' and block the computer user from logging on			1
one of the ways to block a target communicating reads : ' @entity129 their phone with text messages , bombard their phone with calls , delete their online presence , block up their fax machine			0
' the slide details examples of how this was used in @entity139 including significantly disrupting the @entity140 , sending targets a text message ' every 10 seconds or so ' and ' calling targets on a regular basis '			0
the @entity1 cyber spies also used blog posts and information spread via blogs in an operation against @entity150			0
one of the ways to stop a target communicating reads : ' @entity129 their phone with text messages , bombard their phone with calls , delete their online presence , block up their fax machine ' the same 2012 presentation describes the ' honey trap ' method of discrediting a target commenting it is ' very successful ' when it works			0
the individual is lured ' to go somewhere on the internet , or a physical location ' where they are then ' met by a friendly face			0
' it does not give any examples of when the honey trap has been used by @entity1 agents , but the same slide also details how ' paranoia ' can be heightened by changing a target 's photo on a social networking website - the slide reads ' you have been warned @entity20 is about ! ' a programme called ' @entity177 ' took advantage of hotel reservation systems to track the location of foreign diplomats and the slides encourage agents to monitor targets through ' close access technical operations '			0
it also suggests they question ' can we influence hotel choice ? can we cancel their visits ? ' according to reports in @entity194 last year , @entity1 intelligence tapped the reservations systems of over 350 top hotels around the world for the past three years to set up the programme			0
using the @entity47 ’s @entity199 ( signal - intelligence ) program it was used to spy on trade delegations , foreign diplomats , and other targets with a taste for the high life			1
@entity32 news reported @entity47 would not comment on the newly published documents or on @entity20 ’s operations			1
in a statement it told them : ' all of @entity47 's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework , ' said the statement , ' which ensure [ s ] that our activities are authorized , necessary and proportionate , and that there is rigorous oversight , including from the @entity220 , the @entity199 and intelligence services commissioners and the @entity222 and @entity223			1
all of our operational processes rigorously support this position			0
