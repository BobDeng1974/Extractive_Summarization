put down that moisturiser and remove that man bag from your person boys because metrosexuality is well and truly over			0
nowadays it 's all about the ' lumbersexuals '			0
not literally men who are lumberjacks ( because really , where are you going to find one of those ? ) but men who look like they could be			2
unlike their metrosexual brothers these men look rugged , unkempt and like they 'd be a dab hand at using an axe ... even if they 've never picked one up in their lives			1
@entity18 and @entity19 both enjoy the lumbersexual look in relaxed shirts , however , there is still a sense that these are men who take pride in their looks @entity25 used to be the king of the metrosexual men but now he prefers a more relaxed ' lumbersexual ' look with his scruffy beard and checked shirt they have beards , checked shirts and are decidedly more hipster than the dapper fellows we 've been hanging around with for the last ten years			1
but unlike real life lumberjacks , where the inspiration for the name of the trend is derived from , their look is still calculated , their beards often groomed to within an inch of their lives , no hair out of place			1
as online site @entity47 says , ' he looks like a hardened outdoorsman but his flannel feels soft to the touch			0
' he will open your beer with an omni - present @entity55 knife			2
he is a master of the retro @entity57 filter			0
his flannel is coated with a waterproof @entity59 coating			0
' his laid back style has been honed with more effort than he would like you to know			0
' ' whether the roots of the @entity65 are a cultural shift toward environmentalism , rebellion against the grind of 9 - 5 office jobs , or simply recognition that outdoor gear is just more comfortable , functional and durable , the @entity63 is on the rise			2
' @entity74 ' should not be confused with real life lumberjacks who actually do frequent forrests and enjoy chopping trees model @entity79 has previously revealed that he does not identify with the ' hipster ' label some people have bestowed upon him			0
but how would he feel about being a lumbersexual ? many celebrities have already been giving the look a go			2
from @entity18 who has long been a fan of the plaid flannel shirts favoured by real life lumberjacks , to @entity19 whose off - screen look is relaxed , almost scruffy at times			1
@entity25 , professor @entity92 and @entity94 's partner @entity93 are all also in on the lumbersexual trend , often shying away from being overly preened whether they 're heading out for a walk , or heading to the red carpet			1
some websites though have joked that these men are just metrosexuals in disguise with @entity103 describing them as , ' a metro - sexual who has the need to hold on to some outdoor based rugged - ness , thus opting to keep a finely trimmed beard			1
' professor @entity92 heads to a party rocking a checked shirt and cap , perhaps he hurt is leg going for a ramble in the woods @entity94 's partner actor @entity93 enjoys a relaxed look coupling his checked shirt with a pair of boots that would be suitable for wearing on a hike indeed , it does seem that whilst these men look like they could have just stepped out of the woods there is a conscious decision - and a considerable amount of effort - behind their styling			1
and even though it is likely that we will be seeing lumbersexuals around more and more , writer @entity133 thinks that men probably wo n't want to take ownership of the label themselves			0
' it goes without saying that virtually no man ever called himself a metrosexual , which really just referred to men who shopped for their own pants , went to the gym , and used moisturizer , ' he said			1
' so do nâ€™t expect the term @entity65 to blow up , no matter how ubiquitous @entity74 become			0
