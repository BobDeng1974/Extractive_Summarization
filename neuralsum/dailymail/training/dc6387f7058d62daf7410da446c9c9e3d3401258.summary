@entity1 's king @entity0 today apologised for going elephant - hunting in @entity3 while everyday people in his country endure a severe economic crisis			1
in an unprecedented act of royal contrition , the monarch said : ' i am very sorry			0
it wo n't happen again			0
' looking sheepish and using crutches to walk , he spoke as he left the @entity15 hospital where underwent surgery after breaking his hip in a fall during the trip to @entity19			0
contrite : @entity0 of @entity1 apologised for going elephant hunting after he was discharged from hospital following hip replacement surgery under fire : @entity1 king @entity0 ( right ) , pictured during a previous elephant hunting trip in @entity3 , has come in for criticism for his safari it came as calls grew for him to be stripped of his honorary presidency of the @entity1 branch of the @entity32			1
@entity33 , the secretary general of @entity34 , said the king 's position as patron had become untenable			2
he said : ' it 's a problem of the image it sends nationally and internationally rather than the issue of elephant conservation in @entity19			0
' the 74 - year - old monarch had come under scathing criticism this week after he went on the expensive safari as both @entity1 and its citizens struggled amid an economic crisis that has worsened by the day			1
the trip came to light when the king fell and had to be rushed back to @entity1 on friday			1
a royal palace official denied news accounts that the monarch left the country without telling the government saying that he told the prime minister where he was going			0
anger : @entity0 ( left , on a previous trip ) has been slammed for his upper - class pursuit as his country goes through the economic doldrums and justice minister @entity62 said yesterday that prime minister @entity63 always knows where the head of state is			2
the palace official added the king made the trip as a guest of unnamed hosts - so no taxpayer money was spent			0
farewell : @entity1 's @entity0 pictured leaving from the @entity15 hospital yesterday newspaper reports today suggested he was the guest of @entity74 , a @entity76 - born @entity75 business man and right - hand man of @entity75 's defence minister @entity78			1
@entity74 is said to be a key figure in securing a @entity1 consortium the â‚¬ 6.7billion contract to build a high - speed rail link between @entity83 and @entity84			1
many @entity1 were dumbfounded that the king could make such an opulent journey while everyday people brave a 23 per cent unemployment rate , a shrinking economy and fears the country will be the next after @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 to need a bailout			2
for many , the trip made the king 's recent comments about how he could not sleep at night thinking about the country 's unemployed ring hollow			0
news of the safari caused an uproar so loud it eclipsed @entity1 's economic crisis for a few days			1
members of most political parties had urged the king to say he was sorry			0
the palace official confirmed the apology was unprecedented in the history of @entity1 's monarchy			1
the royal family has been in the news a lot lately - and not for the best reasons			0
the king 's son - in - law @entity114 is a suspect in a corruption case , accused of using his position to embezzle several million euros in public contracts through a not - for - profit foundation			1
then , over @entity123 , the king 's 13 - year - old grandson shot himself in the foot with a shotgun , even though by law in @entity1 you must be 14 to handle a gun			1
unlucky : the @entity1 king was on trip hunting elephants in @entity19 when he fell after returning to his bedroom in a lodge until now , @entity0 had always been a highly respected figure in @entity1 and almost never came in for criticism from either politicians or the media			2
the king rarely speaks out on current affairs in @entity1			2
but with the royal family looking so bad because of the @entity145 case , in his traditional @entity142 address last year , the king made a point of saying ' everyone is equal in the eyes of the law '			0
he said he was worried because of what he called growing mistrust of ' some of our institutions ' .			0

@entity1 is being sucked back into @entity156 's *financial* crisis
one in four out of work , and 50 *%* of *youngsters* *jobless*
anger at *ongoing* corruption probe into @entity129 's son - in - law
