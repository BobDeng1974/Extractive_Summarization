he says that hunters and animal - lovers should put their differences aside to tackle the problem , @entity21 on sunday reported mr @entity3 said : ' i ca n't understand why anyone would want to kill animals for fun , and anybody who dies , i think , is psychopathic			1
' ' but i 'm not a bunny - hugger			2
some areas would benefit from a reduction in deer or @entity32 mink because they have no natural predators and cause notable damage			1
' i could see a creative partnership between the conservationists and the shooting fraternity			2
' the @entity32 mink is considered to be bad for the environment because it kills water voles			2
