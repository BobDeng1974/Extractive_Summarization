a problem that could n't be solved with a bucket , a printer or even a trusty cardboard box led two @entity5 college students to create the @entity6 , a comfortable under - the - desk cradle for your feet			2
@entity10 and his housemate @entity9 , both 21 , launch a @entity12 fundraising campaign on january 6 to raise $ 100,000 , their first target , to launch full - scale production of their product			1
the @entity18 attaches to the underside of any desk , the place the designers argue we spend more time at than we sleep			2
@entity10 says we spend at least six hours a day at a desk , and gamers such as he and @entity9 can add an average of seven hours a week			1
a fleece version of @entity28 , created by @entity5 college students @entity10 and @entity9 ' i tried a bunch of different solutions , ' says @entity10 , who studies at @entity33 in @entity34			1
' i tried a cardboard box , that was n't very comfortable			0
i tried my printer , and ended up breaking that			0
' he also tried a bucket under the desk to rest his feet on , pushing his feet against the wall and sitting on them - but none of those instinctive solutions cut it			0
so after testing 50 fabrics and 20 methods to attach the hammock to the desk , they came up with the final product			0
the hammock also comes in a mesh version intended for using while wearing shoes the product attaches to the underside of any desk , says the designers it 's ' easy to take up and down ' and ' totally adjustable ' , says @entity9 , who goes to @entity63			1
there 's a mesh version for shoes on , a fleece one intended to make bare feet feel snug and a heated version , just like a mini electric blanket for your feet			2
while there 's not mention of the egonomics involved in their means of sitting , but they do say it 's ' the most comfortable way to sit at your desk			0
