potty ! the spa 's clientele are fresh - faced with peachy plump skin - because they are babies the towels are oh - so fluffy and the massage menu seductive , with its whispered promises of one - way , all - inclusive trips to planet bliss			1
the clientele are polished and gorgeous — all peachy plump skin , silky hair and @entity14 - chic			2
they arrived today , driven past the monied and white stucco - fronted mansions of @entity17 — just a stone ’s throw from @entity20 and @entity22 ’s residence , no less — in their 4x4s , to indulge in a little ‘ me ’ time at the local spa			1
a day to kick off the nappy and let the griping , winding and weaning stresses of the day float away			0
welcome to @entity31 ’s first @entity30 , where some very privileged tiny tots get to hang out in their own temperature - controlled pool , and catch - up on a few gurgles with some like - minded friends , before enjoying an indulgent baby massage			1
now i may be a new mother to six - week - old @entity38 , but when i heard about the spa i thought it sounded ludicrous			2
i ’m slowly being introduced to the world of the modern middle - class mummy , with its baby yoga and infant reflexology classes			2
but a spa ? for babies ? it did seem somewhat beyond the pale			0
not , however , according to founder @entity50 , 68 , who insists it ’s no gimmick			1
instead , she ’s convinced that a half - hour session in the temperature - controlled , purified waters have a raft of therapeutic effects , helping babies sleep and even tackling typical baby ills such as colic			1
she ’s even invented a flotation device , known as a @entity61 , which clips around the back of a baby ’s neck and supports their head while the water buoys up their body , allowing babies an indulgent , ‘ hands - free ’ floating experience			1
there are plans to roll out branches of the spa across @entity31 , although whether anyone other than wealthy @entity78 will shell out the cool £ 60 per visit is anyone ’s guess			1
my web designer husband @entity82 is less convinced when i tell him of my and @entity38 ’s plans for the day			0
‘ what exactly is the point ? ’ he asks me			0
like many women , i ’ve visited the odd spa on hen weekends and girlie mini-breaks , but i ’m inclined to think that paying a fortune to lounge around for hours by a @entity109 in a damp dressing gown is a bit of a waste of money			0
now i am about to find out whether i ’ll feel the same way about this infant version , which is tucked away in a courtyard in one of @entity119 ’s most exclusive postcodes			0
just like a normal spa , the reception is a calm oasis of white walls , comfy sofas and soothing music , while there ’s even a ‘ chill - out room ’ , except this one is equipped with comfy chairs and cushions for breastfeeding			2
beyond that though , it ’s tiny , with just the one room housing a baby - sized pool and specially designed ‘ neonatal pods ’ — resembling a row of top - loading washing machines — for bathers , each one the size and depth of a large sink and filled with purified water , and warmed to a precise 35.6 c for optimum comfort			1
i am greeted by @entity50 , a stately but gentle @entity142			1
as this is my first visit , she asks some questions about @entity38 ’s arrival			0
no dummy : founder @entity50 has invented a flotation device , known as a @entity61 , which clips around the back of a baby ’s neck and supports their head while the water buoys up their body for a ' hands - free ' float a difficult birth , for example , might make a baby more sensitive to human touch			1
@entity38 certainly falls into this category : 11 days overdue , he came into the world after a marathon 60 - hour labour ending in an emergency caesarean section and weighing a hefty 9lb 9oz			2
it was n’t exactly the calm and positive start in life that i had envisioned for him			0
maybe a bit of spa time is just what we both need			0
i worry he is a bit too young for such a new experience , but @entity50 reassures me that she has had babies little more than a day old in her spa , and water is something of a home - from - home for them after nine months in the womb			1
next it ’s off to the spa room itself , where i find babies @entity189 and @entity191 already merrily bobbing about in the pool — their heads encased in what appear to be big purple doughnuts — their expressions a mixture of puzzlement and @entity199			2
i ’m not sure whether it ’s appropriate to burst out laughing , but they look as if they ’ve accidentally got their heads stuck in a cushion			0
these are the @entity61 flotation devices , which sit under the baby ’s chin , keeping the mouth clear of the water , while allowing them to float and kick about safely			0
five and six months old respectively , their mothers @entity213 , 36 , and @entity214 , 33 — a smart and well - spoken pair — have been bringing them here once a week since they were tiny and both are convinced it has had therapeutic effects			2
‘ they sleep brilliantly every time they ’ve been here , and seem more relaxed , ’ @entity213 tells me			2
moreover , she says , the visits have helped to clear up @entity189 ’s colic			2
this sounds promising , especially as both babies both look like they ’re enjoying themselves , gurgling happily and flipping over like tiny mermaids in swimming nappies			0
i ’m more than happy for @entity38 to join them , but as it ’s his first time , @entity50 feels it would be better to put him in a neonatal pod so that he feels more secure			1
@entity50 gently fastens the flotation device round his neck before lowering him into the water , naked as the day he was born			1
i worry about the lack of swimming nappy , but @entity50 says she likes them to go au naturel to enhance their experience			1
this is @entity38 ’s first skinny dip ! next it ’s off to the spa room itself , where i find babies @entity189 and @entity191 already merrily bobbing about in the pool , their heads encased in purple doughnuts and their expressions a mixture of puzzlement and @entity199 long battle : the idea for the spa dated to the @entity260 when @entity50 was a children ’s swimming teacher for a second or two @entity38 looks unsure , but then he relaxes , kicking his little legs and arms below the water			1
it strikes me it must be a nice feeling to stretch out vertically — so many newborn babies spend their lives hunched in their mother ’s arms or swaddled in their cots			0
he seems equally chilled out when we lift him out ten minutes later			0
next it ’s time for the massage , which @entity50 does using pure grapeseed oil , as it ’s gentle on a baby ’s skin			1
asking me to watch so that i can repeat it at home if i wish , she uses surprisingly firm strokes , as otherwise , she tells me , the baby can think you are tickling them , which can feel irritating			0
@entity50 even massages @entity38 ’s back and the top of his buttocks — an area where babies apparently store a lot of tension from crying — and my son emits tiny little squeaks of pleasure			1
i ’m impressed , it ’s lovely to see @entity38 so relaxed			0
as she works her magic @entity50 , herself a mother of three grown - up children , tells me that the idea for the baby spa dates back to the @entity260 when she was a children ’s swimming teacher and realised that the earlier a baby could be made to feel comfortable in water , the better			1
bobbing along : for those who feel it 's pretentious nonsense ... is there any price too high for a night 's sleep ? the problem was finding a way babies could be supported so they can go it alone , enjoying a good old kickabout , without you having to climb in too			1
the problem foxed her until , five years ago , her engineer husband @entity320 came up with the @entity61			0
the baby spa followed a year later , and has proved a success			0
since it opened in 2010 , between 16 and 21 babies a day have been wheeled through the doors			0
nonetheless , i can see why the mums keep coming back : within ten minutes of being popped back in his babygrow , @entity38 is snoozing in my arms , and remains zonked for the hour - long car journey home			1
that evening , he goes to sleep more readily than usual , and lasts slightly longer until his first night - time feed — the @entity330 for tired new mums			1
even @entity82 is impressed , although it ’s not enough to make him a convert			0
as far as he ’s concerned , if we have a spare £ 60 , it ’d be better spent on something else — like a babysitter			0
and , of course , many will also dismiss the baby spa as pampered nonsense for women with too much money			0
as for me — well , i find myself thinking that you ca n’t put a price on a good night ’s sleep .			2
