@entity0 tore into his ‘ lifeless ’ players after watching his side get picked apart by an @entity4 team now adding attacking verve to defensive resilience			1
the @entity8 manager was infuriated by what he called the worst performance he has overseen and said it was a wake - up call to a squad perhaps still basking in praise earned last campaign			1
do not be misled by the slender margin of victory			0
@entity18 ’s side deserved all three points from their first - half show alone , in which @entity21 and @entity22 scored the decisive @entity23 were the second and third shots on target for @entity4 this season , following a 1 - 0 win at @entity28 and goalless draw with @entity30 , moving the team into the @entity33 places			1
not even @entity18 expects @entity4 to remain there , but promising signs abound			1
it certainly seems that way for @entity18 , who was serenaded by the home crowd and happily obliged calls for a wave			2
this fixture in may was the one that saw @entity4 win to confirm their safety amid much uncertainty , coming weeks after @entity18 was abused by his own fans during a loss at @entity96			1
the attendance at @entity42 was only 28,336 , the lowest for some time , but in the first 45 minutes they were treated to an exhibition of positive football built on pace , high pressing and precise passing			2
@entity51 showed why he has been called up to the @entity104 squad by @entity105			0
@entity8 , by contrast , were ineffective and sloppy			2
captain @entity57 was hooked at half - time			2
they did rouse themselves late on and with 16 minutes to go @entity69 claimed his second goal in as many games			1
but @entity0 was still livid post-match after delivering a half - time team talk he described as ‘ unrepeatable ’			2
‘ that was arguably the worst i ’ve seen us perform in a first half in my two years here , ’ he said			0
‘ i wo n’t accept it , a performance where we were so lifeless it was incredible			0
‘ we did n’t get above a jog , so how do you expect to win a @entity124 game ? we have got 12 going away on international duty			0
mind you , keep playing like that and they wo n’t be internationals			0
‘ @entity57 was not injured			0
whether he ’s the captain or not , he did n’t perform to the level i expect of him , he was a shadow of himself			0
’ @entity0 was happy to announce the club - record £ 10million signing of @entity134 international striker @entity133 was complete			0
@entity18 , meanwhile , heaped praise on his players			2
‘ first half we were outstanding , ’ he said			0
‘ i think @entity139 was unplayable			0
his running power and speed was excellent			0
i thought the movement through midfield was terrific			0
it has been a great start and hopefully we can keep it going			0
’ how @entity51 , @entity21 and @entity48 set up @entity22 's goal			1
@entity148 build - up : the lead up to @entity22 's goal @entity152 and power : @entity21 was a handful for the @entity8 defence and was well rewarded with the 13th minute strike helpless : @entity8 keeper @entity56 is despondent after he is beaten by @entity21 for a deserved 1 - 0 keeping it tight : @entity8 's @entity60 ( centre ) is surrounded by @entity45 ( left ) and @entity46 ( right ) double - up : @entity22 fed @entity21 for the first goal and made it 2 - 0 with his own goal after 36 minutes slotted : @entity22 finishes off from inside the box after picking up a cut - back from @entity48 elated : @entity4 players flock to @entity22 after they took total control of the match at 2 - 0 pleasure : @entity4 boss @entity18 celebrates his side 's second goal as their solid start to the season continues pain : @entity8 boss @entity0 reacts to @entity22 's finish @entity43 became the eighth @entity4 player to be booked this season — more than any other @entity124 team			1
both @entity4 goals followed the same pattern , originating from @entity8 ’s defence conceding possession and ending with quick passing moves neatly finished			1
for the first in the 14th minute , @entity66 ’s ball forward was poached by @entity45 , who gave possession to @entity52			0
he found @entity51 , who found @entity22 and his cute pass led to @entity21 turning and shooting in one swift movement			1
for the second , nine minutes before the interval , it was @entity59 , on his @entity8 debut after a £ 6m move from @entity193 , with an errant pass			2
@entity51 intercepted and gave it to @entity21 , who found @entity48 advancing fast and his cut - back was controlled and finished calmly by @entity22			1
the second half was meandering along with @entity4 in control until 16 minutes from time when a @entity8 goal from nowhere — @entity69 nodding in @entity68 ’s free - kick via a heavy deflection off @entity47 — sparked the contest into life			1
it was the first time @entity18 ’s defence had been breached in 254 minutes			2
@entity4 ended the match with 10 men as captain @entity46 limped off with a calf injury and all @entity18 ’s substitutes used , but they held firm			1
new man in : @entity8 's new signing @entity59 attempts to contain @entity21 in his wake : @entity51 skips away from @entity59 as the former @entity193 defender can only watch on mediator : referee @entity72 stands between @entity4 's @entity21 ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) fight - back : @entity69 celebrates his goal after a free - kick from @entity68 late comer : @entity220 joined the action for the closing moments after coming on for @entity21 it 's not too late to play @entity224 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			1

@entity21 and @entity22 scored first - half goals for @entity4 at @entity42
@entity69 scored from a header which took a deflection from @entity47 to keep @entity8 in the match
@entity69 's goal was the first conceded by @entity18 's side this season
@entity4 remain *undefeated* after three matches with seven points from a possible nine
