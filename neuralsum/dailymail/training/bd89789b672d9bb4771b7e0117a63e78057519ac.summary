aliens are real - not little green men visiting @entity2 as depicted in movies , but rather microbial life in our own solar system and intelligent life beyond			1
that ’s according to two leading @entity9 ( @entity9 ) researchers , who yesterday took part in a hearing at the @entity12 , @entity13 , and technology in @entity15 during the talk dubbed ‘ @entity18 ’ , the scientists laid out the evidence and reasoning for believing we are not alone			1
dr @entity22 ( stock image shown ) and dr @entity24 of the @entity25 yesterday laid out their research to @entity27 regarding the search for alien life			1
they say with adequate funding it is almost a certainty we will find alien life in 20 years , be it intelligent or microbial the hearing was arranged to review the current state of the science related to the search for life in the universe			1
dr @entity22 , senior astronomer at the @entity25 in @entity46 , and dr @entity47 , @entity48 at the @entity49 , both laid out the science and requested more funding to continue the search			1
in 1959 , @entity55 physicists @entity53 and @entity56 published an article discussing the potential to use microwave radio to communicate between stars			0
a year later in 1960 , astronomer @entity61 conducted the first hunt for alien life with an 85 - foot ( 25 metres ) antenna in @entity64 , but after two months concedes defeat.in the 1960s , @entity65 performs extensive searches for @entity68 , again with no success			2
in the 1970s @entity70 began to take an interest in @entity9 , with the chances of success seemingly growing as technology advanced			1
in 1988 , @entity70 began sweeping surveys of the night sky for signals , but @entity27 terminated funding a few years later			1
the independent @entity25 , established in 1984 , took over the job			0
in 1992 the first planet outside the solar system is confirmed , an almost certainly uninhabitable world orbiting a pulsar			1
in 2009 @entity70 ’s kepler telescope launches and , over the next few years , finds hundreds of planets			0
and just last month , the first planet of a similar size to @entity2 and at the correct distance from its parent star to host water , called @entity90 186 - f , was found			2
it is the most likely place that has been found that could host life as we know it			1
and , they add , with adequate support it is likely we will find alien life in some form or another within 20 years			1
‘ in the last two decades , astronomers have uncovered one so - called exoplanet after another , ’ dr @entity22 said in his written testimony			1
‘ the current tally is approximately two thousand , and many more are in the offing thanks to continued analysis of data from @entity70 ’s enormously successful @entity90 space telescope			2
‘ estimates are that at least 70 per cent of all stars are accompanied by planets , and since the latter can occur in systems rather than as individuals ( think of our own solar system ) , the number of planets in the @entity112 galaxy is of order one trillion			1
‘ it bears mentioning that the @entity112 is only one of 150 billion galaxies visible to our telescopes - and each of these will have its own complement of planets			0
’ dr @entity22 goes on to state how @entity90 ’s primary goal has been to ascertain whether , amongst all these planets , there are habitable worlds like our own			1
‘ the usual metric for whether a planet is habitable or not is to ascertain whether liquid water could exist on its surface , ’ he continues			0
‘ most worlds will either be too cold , too hot or of a type ( like @entity140 ) that may have no solid surface and be swaddled in noxious gases			0
‘ recent analyses of @entity90 data suggest that as many as one star in five will have a habitable , @entity2 - size planet in orbit around it			0
‘ this number could be too large by perhaps a factor of two or three , but even so it implies that the @entity112 is home to 10 to 80 billion cousins of @entity2			0
‘ there is , in other words , more than adequate cosmic real estate for extraterrestrial life , including intelligent life			1
’ the two astronomers cite discoveries by @entity70 's kepler telescope as imperative to their research			0
most notably , the telescope has found thousands of planets and several could be habitable such as @entity164 ( pictured )			2
they estimate there are 10 to 80 billion ' @entity2 cousins ' in our @entity112 alone using resources such as the @entity171 ( pictured ) seti astronomers hope they will one day detect a signal from an intelligent extraterrestrial race , either a message that has been sent by accident or random ' noise ' like what is emitted from @entity2 dr @entity47 , meanwhile , was equally optimistic and echoed dr @entity22 ’s views			1
‘ it would be bizarre if we are alone , ’ he told the committee			0
‘ it would be a cramped mind that did n’t wonder what other life is out there			2
’ they also both agreed that @entity2 has never been visited by aliens			2
‘ i do n’t think that that would be something all the governments would have managed to keep a secret , ’ @entity22 said			2
‘ if they were really here i think everyone would know that			0
’ the hearing comes just after a new @entity70 book was published that suggested our planet could have been visited by aliens before			2
the book is titled @entity203 and was edited by dr @entity204 , director of interstellar message composition at the @entity25			0
with the help of other experts he tackles a number of topics including the prospect of life on other planets and the means through which we might send or receive a message			0
in one section dr @entity216 from the @entity217 considers the possibility that rock art on @entity2 is of extraterrestrial origin			0
‘ we can say little , if anything , about what these patterns signify , why they were cut into rocks , or who created them , ’ he writes			0
‘ for all intents and purposes , they might have been made by aliens			0

@entity27 has discussed the @entity9 ( @entity9 )
dr @entity22 and dr @entity47 described the science of looking for aliens
they say with adequate funding life will be found within two decades
this could be microbial life in the solar system or intelligent life outside
and they have asked for more support in their continued search
