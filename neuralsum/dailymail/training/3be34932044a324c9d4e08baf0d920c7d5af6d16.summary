for any homegrown tennis fan , watching @entity0 battle his way through @entity2 is a test of nerves - and the @entity6 is no exception			1
the 30 - year - old yesterday struggled to maintain her royal composure as she cheered on @entity0 during his quarter - final clash with @entity11 's @entity10			1
sitting alongside her husband @entity12 in the @entity13 on @entity14 amid a galaxy of tennis heavyweights , @entity6 looked to be thoroughly enjoying herself			1
thriller : @entity18 of @entity19 nervously chews her lip ( left ) followed by a sharp intake of breath ( right ) as she watches @entity0 take on @entity11 's @entity10 at @entity2 yesterday close game : @entity6 reacts as she watches a particularly tense moment ( left ) and celebrates a @entity0 point a little later ( right ) unbearable : the tension gets the better of the @entity6 , who even resorts to praying for a @entity0 victory at ease : @entity6 relaxes as the sun makes a rare appearance and then shares a joke although they watched much of the match , the couple were not there to see @entity0 's victory			1
they had earlier watched as six - time champion @entity39 beat @entity41 @entity40 before seeing @entity0			1
they may have had to leave early as @entity12 will tomorrow be installed as @entity43 - the highest honour in @entity45 - at a special service in @entity47 with the @entity48 , @entity49 , princess royal and his wife			2
@entity6 recycled an outfit she wore on the couple 's tour of @entity55 exactly a year ago , donning a knitted sailor dress by @entity57 , teaming it with navy blue heels and a @entity60 clutch bag			1
the couple sat on the front row of the @entity13 with @entity64 chairman @entity63 and his wife @entity65			1
their visit completes a family set - on tuesday @entity6 's parents , @entity70 and @entity71 , were invited into the box			1
last week , mrs @entity73 watched on @entity14 , but from the normal seats			2
but the following day @entity6 's siblings @entity75 and @entity76 enjoyed seats in the @entity13 when they put in an appearance at @entity80			1
the @entity81 and @entity82 visited last week , on @entity81 's first visit to the championship since 1970			2
in control : @entity6 forces herself to regain her composure ( left ) before taking it easy ( right ) tennis fan : @entity6 shows her appreciation ( left ) , while one presumably misfired shot leaves her baffled ( right ) stylish : @entity18 finds herself the centre of attention on @entity14 as she arrives to take her seat @entity12 and @entity6 were yesterday joined in the prime seats by famous faces including tennis couple @entity97 and @entity98 , television sports presenter @entity99 , veteran broadcaster sir @entity100 and @entity102 football manager @entity101			1
@entity0 was also watched by his usual support team including girlfriend @entity104 - spotted biting her nails during the tense match - and mother @entity106			2
he roared to victory over @entity10 and booked himself a place in the semi-finals after a nail - biting tie - break			1
he will now take on @entity113 in tomorrow 's semi-final			2
the @entity116 number one was given a reprieve from the rain , playing in dry weather apart from one brief delay , clinching victory with an ace			0
he did his now - trademark ' fingers to the sky ' gesture as fans celebrated the win			0
in his post-match press conference , the 25 - year - old said playing ' tough opponent ' @entity113 would be a challenge , but he was ' trying my best to win the tournament for myself obviously , but also for everybody else '			0
gripped : @entity12 and @entity6 are on the edge of their seats as they watch @entity0 and @entity10 battle it out two sides of a coin : a moment of introspection of @entity12 as @entity6 airs her excitement that 's more like it : the royal couple make clear their approval as @entity0 wins a hard - fought point asked about playing in front of @entity12 and @entity6 , he said : ' obviously i was aware of it			1
we got told this morning before we went on the court , and obviously when i saw @entity39 playing i saw them sitting in the @entity13			2
' i think it 's always going to make a difference when you have royalty in there			2
' for me , also playing in front of someone like @entity97 as well and @entity98			0
@entity164 was there , too			0
you know , it was an unbelievable privilege to play in front of those people			0
' earlier , six - time champion @entity39 revealed he met @entity12 and @entity6			1
he said : ' they were very nice , very friendly			0
we had a bit of a chat			0
what exactly , it 's not so important i do n't think			0
but it was a nice conversation			0
' @entity178 coming out , i think it 's inspiring , too , in some ways , believe it or not			0
it 's great for the event			0
it 's great for @entity2			1
it 's great for the club			0
it 's great for the players			0
' @entity0 's latest victory is guaranteed to send ' @entity0 mania ' into overdrive			2
@entity191 , 20 , from @entity192 , said : ' it 's exciting that he 's through to the semi-final			0
' good company : @entity6 and @entity12 are surrounded by tennis heavyweights in the @entity13 stretching out : @entity0 struggles to scoop the ball back to @entity10 summer ? the crowd on @entity200 anxiously watches the action on a big screen as rain clouds threaten to interrupt play @entity205 and @entity206 , who travelled from @entity207 with son @entity208 , met up with daughter @entity209 who is working at the championships			1
mrs @entity211 , 52 , said : ' it was fantastic			0
it was looking a bit uncertain at times , and we knew it would be tough , but it 's so great that he 's through			0
' and the victory boosted @entity0 's odds with the bookies , with @entity222 putting him at 1/2 to beat @entity113 - the shortest odds for a @entity224 to make the final since 1938 - and 9/2 to win the grand slam			1
spokesman @entity227 said : ' @entity0 has the best of the semi-finals and the odds suggest we will have a @entity116 player in the final			2

@entity6 sat alongside prince @entity12 in the @entity13 on @entity2 's @entity14 amid a galaxy of tennis heavyweights
she looked to be thoroughly enjoying herself as @entity0 beat @entity11 's @entity10 to *progress* to the semi-finals
