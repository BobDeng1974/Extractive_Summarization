the new chairman of a long - awaited @entity2 inquiry into historic child sex abuse was facing calls to resign last night after @entity5 discovered her astonishing links to @entity7 – a key figure embroiled in the scandal			1
@entity11 , the lord mayor of london , was appointed to carry out the important role of investigating claims of an @entity15 cover - up of vip paedophile rings on friday , two months after the original chairman was forced to step down over conflicts of interest			1
but this newspaper has found that the top corporate lawyer is also closely linked to @entity7 – who is likely to give evidence to her inquiry			0
‘ if it ’s found that @entity11 is close to the @entity38 , her position is untenable and she needs to be clear about what her relationship is with @entity7 , who is one of the most significant figures in terms of suggestions of a cover - up , ’ he said			1
‘ surely the @entity45 was aware of this before they suggested appointing her ? ’ @entity48 , the chairman of the @entity49 for people abused in @entity51 , said : ‘ it would once again seem to be incredibly inappropriate that she would even be offered the appointment			2
’ chairmen past and present : @entity55 ( left ) stood down because her brother @entity56 was attorney general during the 1980s , when he tried to dissuade the @entity59 mp @entity58 from revealing that senior diplomat sir @entity60 was a paedophile ; @entity11 , the lord mayor of london , replaced her but she , too , has links to @entity7 home secretary @entity64 , who personally appointed mrs @entity11 after her background was checked by officials , was also facing questions about her judgement			1
last night it was not clear if she had been made aware of mrs @entity11 ’s close association with the @entity38			1
@entity28 mp @entity71 said : ‘ if @entity11 is friends with @entity7 , that is a problem			1
if that ’s the case , she should n’t have accepted the job			0
she needs to move straight away to clear the air – it would be a catastrophe to lose a second chairman			0
‘ the @entity45 also needs to clear the air and demonstrate that it did due diligence			0
’ and @entity28 mp @entity83 said that he would call mrs @entity11 to give evidence before his influential @entity85 , adding : ‘ i am sure she will want to be as open and transparent as possible			1
’ the public inquiry was announced in early july , following months of pressure from mps and campaign groups as more and more claims emerged of secret vip sex rings across @entity93 and child abuse in schools , hospitals and churches , dating back more than 30 years , with the perpetrators spared justice by an @entity15 cover - up			1
it suffered a massive setback within weeks when the chairman , former high court judge @entity103 , was forced to quit over conflicts of interest			0
over the summer , the @entity45 has been searching for a suitable replacement whose experience and background would command respect from victims and @entity113 , while also having the required distance from the individuals and institutions they will have to scrutinise			0
on friday , it was announced that mrs @entity11 had been appointed , with the aim of publishing an interim report before next may ’s general election			1
mrs @entity11 said she was ‘ honoured ’ and added that learning from the mistakes of the past was a ‘ vital and solemn undertaking ’			2
@entity103 was originally appointed to lead the inquiry into historic allegations of child abuse but stood down because of concern over potential conflict of interest			0
now , however , her links may be seen as less concerning than those that have put @entity11 ’s appointment in doubt			2
@entity103 ’s brother , @entity56 , was attorney general during the 1980s , when he tried to dissuade the @entity59 mp @entity58 from revealing that senior diplomat sir @entity60 was a paedophile			1
but mr @entity58 , who handed a dossier on alleged child abusers to then home secretary sir @entity7 , used parliamentary privilege to name @entity60 as a member of the @entity142			2
@entity60 was given a police caution for possessing child abuse images			0
the baroness had chaired the @entity147 inquiry into child abuse and was once the highest - ranking female judge in @entity93 and president of the @entity151 of the @entity151			0
but despite her expertise , critics still said she should resign because of her brother ’s history			0
on quitting , she said she had never put the reputation of an institution before justice for victims			0
but @entity163 research soon suggested the @entity45 had not learned from its own mistakes			0
publicly available documents revealed that mrs @entity11 , 66 , has several close links to the former home secretary @entity7 and his wife			1
it calls into question her ability to run the inquiry because earlier this year @entity7 was at the centre of a storm over an alleged cover - up of child sex abuse and a missing list of alleged vip paedophiles			1
he admitted he had received the so - called ‘ @entity58 dossier ’ from campaigning mp @entity58 in 1983 but insisted he had passed the papers on to @entity45 officials			2
it then emerged he had recently been questioned by @entity185 over allegations that he raped an 19 - year - old in 1967			0
he denies the claims and has not been arrested or charged			0
the @entity45 last night refused to answer questions about what it had known about mrs @entity11 ’s links to @entity7			1
the @entity193 yesterday refused to answer questions from @entity5 as they drove away from their home			2
mrs @entity11 could not be reached .			2
