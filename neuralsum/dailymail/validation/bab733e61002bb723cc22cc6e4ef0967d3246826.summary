@entity0 affords himself a sneaky peak through the green mesh fence at @entity5 's @entity4 training ground			1
next door @entity6 are going through their paces			2
it is not too revealing but for @entity0 it is a glimpse into what he hopes is the very near future			1
the former @entity15 midfielder wants to manage a @entity17 club and @entity5 , one of seven teams to have been top of the championship so far this season , have a foot in the door			1
' i take a little look now and again , ' he says wryly			2
' it 's good to have them so close , it 's a reminder of what we want to be			2
we ca n't get ahead of ourselves as this is an unforgiving division but it 's the dream			2
' @entity5 boss @entity0 hopes he can lead the club to the premier league next season @entity0 is the fourth man to be put in charge of @entity5 during this campaign and joined them in october @entity41 is befitting of a @entity21 promotion race that has nine teams still vying for a @entity17 place with seven games remaining			1
the next week is a defining moment with @entity5 second in the table and facing rivals @entity49 and @entity51 in their next two matches			1
the fact @entity5 are there at all is testament to the former @entity15 midfielder when you consider he is their fourth coach of the season			1
perhaps ominously , he is also out of contract in the summer			2
' it 's true we did n't have the best start in terms of changes , ' he says , with understatement			2
' but i knew what i was coming to			2
' @entity70 @entity69 began the season in charge and started well but his exit followed talk of dressing - room unrest			1
in a bizarre five - week period , @entity76 succeeded @entity69 but stepped down after suffering chest pains in his first game and was replaced by @entity79			2
eight days later , after a win and a draw , owner @entity80 called for @entity0 , who had won two doubles with @entity84 and the @entity85 with @entity86			1
he was recommended to @entity87 by staff at one of the @entity70 businessman 's other clubs , @entity90 , who recognised his ability to ' find solutions on a small budget '			0
' it was definitely strange			0
it 's normal for other countries but unusual here , ' he says			0
' for me , it was just a great opportunity ; a small door opened to a big chance			1
i did n't know the championship well but i knew what to expect from my time at @entity15			0
i 've always watched @entity108 football and i believe in myself			0
' you can look at the fact the club had three coaches before i arrived but i 've never been one to worry about what may happen tomorrow , just try and control today			1
i was excited not worried			0
i knew there would be little money , that i could n't bring my own staff but fortunately after a few days i found i was working with quality people			0
i 'm confident i can make any team better			1
i 've lived with pressure since i was 18			0
my family instilled the same principles , there 's no magic formula , just a belief that if you work hard , life will treat you well			0
' despite losing 1 - 0 to @entity128 in their last game , @entity5 are currently second in the @entity21 table @entity5 midfielder @entity131 ( left ) dribbles with the ball ahead of @entity128 's @entity133 ( right ) @entity0 , or ' @entity134 ' as he prefers , is outside the training ground canteen , sipping coffee			1
the 46 - year - old @entity137 cuts an imposing figure			0
he is tall , lean , ruggedly handsome and has a disarming charm when he talks passionately about his desire to return to the @entity17			1
he was frustrated in the transfer window as the @entity87 principle is more about work than spending , often making players fit between their three clubs @entity5 , @entity90 and @entity147			1
he says @entity148 are the best team in the league but believes he has four good strikers who can make a difference			1
as a player , he was the 2000 model of @entity15 's defensive midfield linchpin @entity155 ; signed by @entity156 from @entity157			0
his regret , you sense , is that the @entity17 did not see the best of him			1
' i was 32 â€” and a half ! my best time had been at @entity157 but i still played 52 games for @entity15 , ' he says			2
' it was faster , stronger			0
' my debut was against @entity168 in the @entity169 and i remember being tackled and playing up for the free - kick like we did in @entity171 but my team - mates turned , saying ' get up , get on with it , we do n't do that here '			2
i was used to playing a passing game , even if it meant going backwards , but the fans would shout and [ coach ] @entity180 took me to one side and said , ' i know what you want to do but here you have to move it forward more quickly '			0
it was all part of learning a different culture , it was good preparation for when i came back			0
' he has kept in touch with former team - mates @entity191 and @entity193			2
both have been sacked in recent months but he does not feel the need to call			0
' now is a time for them to be with their own thoughts , ' he says			0
' they know my feelings for them			0
they are champions and good friends			0
' @entity0 during his @entity15 days pulls back @entity205 midfielder @entity204 ( right ) @entity5 players celebrate after @entity208 's goal against @entity209 in february at @entity210 home is a few miles away near @entity212			1
he is at the training ground for 8am and likes to be last to leave			0
it is a solitary existence as his wife and three children have remained in @entity218 , their family home for the past 13 years			0
indeed , @entity0 holds a @entity171 passport			1
' my eldest daughter is 19 and she came over to visit but it helps that i 'm on my own because it sharpens my focus			0
the job is my life			0
it consumes almost every hour whether i 'm considering the bigger picture or small details			0
this season could come down to one corner or one free - kick			2
listen , if a team in this title race lose concentration , they can pay a very expensive price			2
sir @entity239 has promised @entity5 players a big party if they can secure promotion to the @entity17 ' i know what getting into the @entity17 means to everyone			1
i was introduced to sir @entity239 when he opened the stand at @entity210 named in his honour before @entity247 and he 's a good guy , he promised he 'd send champagne and we 'd have a great party if we go up			1
' although he confesses @entity5 's ' rocket man ' is not on his @entity253 playlist , @entity0 will occasionally watch his favourite @entity255 film , the gangster epic @entity254 , and is reading sir @entity258 's autobiography as he sources extra motivation			1
' you always need to improve and find an edge so it makes sense to look at the man who won the @entity17 more than anyone else			1
hopefully , his words can help			0
i 'm ready for this fight and i do n't intend to surrender until i win it			0
' whether it is admiring the neighbours or his reading material , @entity0 is certainly looking in the right direction			1
if @entity0 can secure @entity5 's return to the top flight , it will be their first appearance since 2006 - 07			1

@entity5 manager @entity0 is targeting promotion to the @entity17 this season
the @entity279 are currently second in the @entity21 table with seven games left to play
*lifelong* @entity5 supporter and former club *chairman* sir @entity239 has promised the team a big party if they reach the @entity17
