by @entity0 a coroner has blasted medics for " serious , repeated and systemic failures " which led to the death of a pensioner from kidney failure			1
@entity7 , 64 , was not given any fluids for 14 hours after a string of delays in his treatment - including a four hour wait for an ambulance to take him to hospital			1
an inquest at @entity18 on tuesday heard how a catalogue of errors by 36 medical staff contributed to mr @entity7 's death on november 7 , 2012			1
@entity7 , 64 , died from kidney failure after he was not given any fluids for 14 hours after a string of delays in his treatment two days before he died , his gp dr @entity28 visited him at his home in @entity30 , @entity31 , after he complained of being dehydrated and suffering from diarrhoea			1
dr @entity28 called @entity34 at 1.53pm on november 5 and told the operator mr @entity7 , who had previously suffered a stroke , required iv fluids when he arrived at hospital			1
but the ambulance failed to arrive so the gp dialled 999 saying it was an emergency but the ailing pensioner was not picked up until 6.19pm because of a mistake by the dispatcher logging the call properly			0
when he finally arrived at the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) in @entity18 , he was taken to a ward but further delays meant he did not have fluids until 3.50am the next day			2
kidney failure happens when the kidneys encounter difficulty removing salt , water and waste products from the bloodstream			0
when this occurs , waste products will accumulate and can reach dangerous levels and cause an imbalance in the blood 's chemical makeup			0
acute renal failure can come on within days or even a matter of hours			0
symptoms include tiredness , passing only a small amount of urine or urine being discoloured			0
acute failure can be fatal and requires treatment			0
one course of treatment is to ensure that the correct fluids are introduced to the body and ensuring the amount of salts and minerals remain at the correct levels while the kidneys recover			2
even when he was given iv fluids he was not given the correct dose which meant he received just two litres within 24 hours instead of the recommended five litres			2
mr @entity7 died the next day on november 7 after suffering kidney failure			2
both the @entity46 and @entity34 have apologised to the family			2
recording a narrative verdict , assistant coroner @entity84 condemned medical staff who treated mr @entity7 - branding them " oblivious " to his care needs			1
she said : " these failures were far - reaching and impacted on all aspects of his care , from basic observations and recordings , to a delay in the escalation of his care and a failure to review his condition by an appropriately senior doctor when necessary			1
" all the while , mr @entity7 's condition continued to deteriorate and those caring for him were oblivious to the same			0
" during the period of his admission , there were several missed opportunities when the correct treatment plan could and should have been pursued			0
" i find that had this been so , the outcome may have been different			0
" speaking after the inquest , mr @entity7 's family blasted the medics who failed to care for their father			1
a statement read : " it is clear that the initial reply from the ambulance service to our complaint about the delayed response to the call for an ambulance that they were ' very busy ' was simply paying lip service to their initial failings in this unfortunate and distressing series of events			1
" in his short and tragic time at the @entity46 , @entity7 was dealt with by around 36 people			1
@entity46 where @entity7 was being treated before his death due to kidney failure " some were clearly shown by the inquest to be hard - working , dedicated individuals struggling in a highly - pressured environment with little support from management despite direct and repeated requests for additional assistance			1
" @entity7 was a character who made us laugh with his mischievous sense of humour			0
" he spent a lot of time caring for others , often to his own detriment			0
eighteen months on he is still very much missed by us all			0
" @entity152 , chief executive of @entity153 , said : " we extend our condolences and reiterate our unreserved apologies to mr @entity7 's family for the failings in our care and for letting them and their father down so badly			1
" the absence of regular clinical observations , handovers between staff and failure to administer fluids appropriately meant mr @entity7 's rapidly deteriorating condition was not acted upon as it should have been			2
" we have learnt from this sad and tragic case and made changes to improve safety and outcomes for our future patients			0
" a spokesman from the ambulance service added : " the service we provided to mr @entity7 fell short of the high standard our patients should expect , and we are very sorry about that			1
" we have since initiated a number of changes and issued guidance to all control staff to ensure that the same error ca n't be made when entering bookings in future			0
