by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 4 march 2013 @entity1 admits he would like @entity2 to take over for a second spell as @entity5 manager			1
asked if he wants to see the ‘ @entity6 ’ back at @entity7 , the @entity9 goalkeeper said : ‘ we had a fantastic success with him , so why not ? he is a fantastic manager			1
’ @entity5 fans united to sing @entity2 ’s name during saturday ’s 1 - 0 home win against @entity17 and @entity1 said : ‘ of course , i understand that			1
@entity2 did a fantastic job for the club and people loved him so he rightly deserved that			1
this is the way it should be			0
’ video : scroll down to watch match highlights eye on the ball : @entity1 sees no harm in the way @entity5 are run and @entity1 also spoke out in support of the @entity5 way , defending the right of senior players to have their say and the right of owner @entity37 to hire and fire as he sees fit			1
the goalkeeper is the first voice from the dressing room to speak publicly since last week ’s training - ground spat between senior players and @entity43			1
two days later , @entity43 took a swipe at the decision to employ him under the title of interim manager , suggesting it had undermined his authority , and confirmed he will definitely leave when his contract expires at the end of the season			1
‘ we do it our way , the other clubs do it their way , and it seems to work so far , so long may it continue , ’ said @entity1 , who arrived at @entity5 in 2004 and has played under eight of @entity37 ’s nine managers			1
‘ you can argue with a lot of things but in the same period of time we won more or less the same number of trophies as @entity67			0
stalwart : the goalkeeper has been a key figure since his 2004 arrival ‘ they had one manager , we had eight , and we won the same trophies			1
we won the @entity76 , there are so many positives			0
‘ @entity78 had the same manager and it is a long time since they won something			2
you ca n’t always say that is the fault of the manager or the players			1
maybe if you asked them if they would rather have 10 managers and six trophies , i do n’t know what they would say			0
’ since @entity2 built his title - winning team at @entity5 , the senior players in the dressing room have developed a formidable reputation for the power they wield and they have never been afraid to take on the manager if they feel something ought to be said			1
‘ we had a lot of success thanks to the honesty and open mind everyone has in the dressing room , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ everybody should have a chance to express an opinion , and if the players are not happy in our dressing room , it is not the case that we say , “ unlucky mate , we will carry on , you pick yourself up ”			2
‘ no. if someone is not happy we try to help them to be happy again and to be at the top			0
this is why , when we see something is going wrong , people have the right to say , “ we think this is wrong , we should improve that , we need to try to find a different solution ”			0
‘ it is important for the manager to know the feedback			0
but there is only one boss and that is the manager			0
miserable : @entity43 's spell at @entity5 has been an unhappy one ‘ it is up to him if he wants to listen to what the players say or find his own way through			1
’ @entity5 beat @entity17 1 - 0 at @entity7 , easing the pressure on @entity43 by keeping the club on track for a top - four finish			1
‘ on saturday , you could see from the start we took control of the game and we created chances			0
the only problem was that we did not finish the game off , ’ added @entity1			2
‘ there are things we are still not doing well but that is a normal situation when you bring in a new manager			0
it needs some time to gel			0
‘ the club took @entity43 because they wanted to improve the situation and achieve the targets we had at the beginning of the season			2
he is here to do his best and to help us as much as he can			0
‘ as players , we must do the same : try to win games ; work hard ; move forward ; achieve the targets			0
as a club , everyone should have the same feeling , no matter how long they ’ve been here			0
we are the @entity5 and we should be united : the players , the fans , the manager , his coaching staff , the board , everybody to achieve the targets			1
’ hostility : @entity5 fans have never accepted @entity43 's appointment intelligent and articulate , @entity1 has become the public voice of the dressing room this season			1
he exhibits the mental strength and confidence typical of @entity5 ’s senior players , a by - product of the success achieved by @entity2 , who won five major trophies in three years at @entity7			1
@entity2 arrived in 2004 and masterminded the club ’s first title in half a century before successfully defending it			0
he also won the @entity188 and @entity189 twice before a breakdown in his working relationship with owner @entity37			2
he was sacked in september 2007			0
the pair are understood to have reconciled many of their differences , although @entity37 still has reservations about the prospect of a return			2
there was no major @entity201 protest on saturday , but there were several banners displayed at the game by @entity5 fans making their views clear on the interim manager			1
returning ? @entity2 remains a hugely popular figure at @entity5 one said : ‘ divided we fall @entity209 ’ , another said : ‘ the interim one ’ and another said : ‘ @entity212 ’			2
@entity43 said : ‘ we had to produce a good game and we did it			2
the players enjoyed it , the fans were behind the team			2
‘ what will happen in the next week , i do n’t know			0
i ’m really pleased after winning , without thinking what will happen in the future			0
’ despite the success with a revolving - door policy on the manager ’s office , @entity1 would like to see the next manager given more time			1
‘ i have been saying that for six years , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ i hope the new manager will find the momentum and he will stay			0
‘ i ’ve been here a long time and i ’ve seen so many things that i do n’t get surprised any more			0
