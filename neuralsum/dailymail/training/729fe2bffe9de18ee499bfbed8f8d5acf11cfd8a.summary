air commodore @entity16 was incarcerated after he was shot down over the @entity17 , in @entity18 , in 1940 , earning his nickname as the only survivor of the attack			0
an extraordinary letter he sent to his wife in @entity23 after spending three years in the camp is going under the hammer tomorrow			1
in the pencil written note , he moaned about the lack of games facilities at @entity13 , branding them ‘ a disgrace ’ but complimented a doctor who lanced his boils with a ‘ razor blade ’			2
after his crash landing he was handed over to @entity35 soldiers and despite a number of unsuccessful escape attempts - including making it on board a @entity41 ship – he was taken to the pow camp , near @entity43 , known as @entity44 in 1940			1
during the war the castle was converted into a high security prisoner - of - war camp for officers who had become security or escape risks or who were regarded as particularly dangerous			1
but that did n’t stop lucky mr @entity1			1
he is credited with having been on the team which built the legendary ‘ @entity54 ’ - an incredible escape plan which involved launching a home - made glider from the castle ’s roof			1
the take - off was scheduled for spring 1945 , but by then the result of the war was becoming clear and the plan was ditched			1
the remarkable letter was written by @entity12 legend , @entity65 to his wife in @entity23 from @entity13 dated august 14 1943 a view of @entity13 in the @entity35 state of @entity68 , which acted as a high - security pow camp during @entity12 prisoners of war at @entity13 line up for inspection			1
the picture is taken from the book " @entity13 : the @entity75 " by @entity76			0
tomorrow the letter is expected to fetch over £ 500 when it is auctioned by @entity79 ’s auctioneers at @entity80 in @entity81			2
dated august 14 , 1943 , it is written in pencil on a pre-printed prisoner of war form - stamped with @entity35 and @entity86 censor marks			1
sent to his wife and signed ‘ @entity1 ’ , the pilot says that he has sent his wife some photographs			1
in the letter , ‘ @entity16 writes : ‘ the footballers are a mixed bunch			2
‘ i have n’t been down to the football field for a hell of a time due to stoppages of privileges or some other reason			0
the letter gives a rare insight into life at the notorious pow camp ‘ the lack of games playing facilities in what is to be an all @entity86 camp is a disgrace			1
‘ the @entity18 men get parcels from @entity18 which supplement their @entity110 parcels and take infinite trouble over their cooking			0
the result is quite amazing			0
‘ a new @entity115 doctor capt @entity114 has arrived and is messing with us he is as far as first impressions go an excellent fellow			0
‘ i ’ve seen quite a lot of him ‘ cos i ’ve had a couple of boils ... he lanced one with a razor blade two days ago			0
’ a spokesperson from @entity79 ’s auctioneers said : ‘ letters from @entity6 are becoming scarce and @entity127 had a colourful war to say the least			0
‘ it is expected to sell for between £ 300 and £ 500 but @entity12 items get a lot of interest we hope it could go even higher			0
’ the idea for the glider came from lieutenant @entity136			0
he realised the roof line , obscured from the @entity35 soldiers ' view , would make a perfect launching point to fly over the @entity141 , surrounding the castle			2
the workshop was set up in the attics of the building , behind a false wall , and the team of men were aided by a library book on aircraft design			0
it is thought the team would have broken through the end wall and launched the glider off a ramp mounted on the roof adjacent			0
@entity157 from bed slats , floor boards , spare electrical wire and prison sleeping bags were all used to construct the two - seater monoplane			2
the rake - off was scheduled for @entity164 , but was put on held when the war began to come to a close			2
however , the team kept their plan on stand - by , fearing a massacre of prisoners			1
the glider was approaching completion when the @entity173 liberated the camp on 16 april 1945			2
the only known image of the @entity54 glider , which was to help @entity86 prisoners escape @entity13			0
