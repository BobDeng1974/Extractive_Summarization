' on numerous occasions during the @entity145 investigation they were criticised , they were hauled up and they were accused of incompetence , which they admitted to , so it 's nothing they do n't already know			1
' they know they 're incompetent , they know they did n't do a thorough job because they were investigating their own people - 65 % of @entity145 members are ex-police , and i believe that 's why @entity114 did not get the justice he should have got			1
