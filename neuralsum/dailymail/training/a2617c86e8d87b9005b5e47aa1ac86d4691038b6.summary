@entity9 from @entity10 , @entity8 hanged herself in her family 's bathroom on thursday after months of torment and , on sunday night , her parents took her off life support			1
questions are now emerging over whether authorities and her friends did enough to help @entity9 , who relatives said quickly slipped from an a-student to a moody , unpredictable teenager			1
no charges were ever brought against @entity9 's alleged attackers following the assault in 2011 ; an investigation was launched but authorities concluded they did not have enough evidence			1
tragic : @entity9 , 17 , has killed herself after allegedly being gang - raped and then bullied on a @entity30 tribute page , her mother , @entity28 , described how her daughter was forever changed by the alleged assault in their hometown of @entity35			1
' she went with a friend to another 's home , ' her mother wrote			2
' in that home , she was raped by four young boys			2
one of those boys took a photo of her being raped and decided it would be fun to distribute the photo to everyone in @entity9 's school and community , where it quickly went viral			1
' the alleged attack left then 15 - year - old @entity9 an outcast at @entity51 , where her rapists were also students			1
friends , students and strangers taunted her , her mother said			2
' people texted her all the time , saying " will you have sex with me ? " ' she said			2
' girls texting , saying " you 're such a slut "			2
' she was never left alone			0
she had to leave the community			2
her friends turned against her			2
people harassed her ... it just never stopped , ' her mother told @entity67			0
struggle : after she was allegedly raped , her attackers spread a photo of the assault around her school her parents moved from @entity35 to @entity74 to help her escape the bullies and @entity9 made new friends and began hearing from her old school friends , who offered her their support			1
she said her daughter also started therapy , which appeared to be helping			0
yet she would become angry quickly , and last week 's suicide attempt was probably the result of a mood swing , @entity28 said			0
' she acted on an impulse , but i truly , in my heart of heart , do not feel she meant to kill herself , ' her mother wrote on @entity30			0
' by the time i broke into the bathroom , it was too late			0
' the @entity8 police launched an investigation , which took a year , but concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring up charges			1
' an investigation into an earlier sexual assault was completed , and in consultation with the @entity103 , there was insufficient evidence to lay charges , ' @entity98 spokesman cpl. @entity97 said			1
sadness : @entity28 , @entity9 's mother , pictured , said she believes the police investigation was flawed family : the family even moved to escape the bullies , but she still struggled with mood swings ' they did n't even interview the boys until much , much later , ' to me , i ’d think you ’d get the boys right away , separate them			1
” relatives said they saw the photograph but could not determine who had taken it , so were unable to charge the teenagers - even though the picture legally constituted child pornography			0
' the whole case was full of things like that , ' @entity28 said			0
we did n’t have a rape kit done because we did n't even know until several days later when she had a breakdown in my kitchen			0
she was trying to keep it to herself			0
' @entity98 spokesman cpl. @entity97 confirmed to the @entity134 that the authorities are currently investigating a sudden death involving a young person , but would not provide further details			0
bullied : @entity9 eventually left the high school when even her friends turned on her , her mother said loss : her family said they do not believe she wanted to die but that it was a spur of the moment decision her mother said she wants other people to learn from the tragedy and how social media allowed her to be continually violated following the brutal rape			1
@entity9 shared her sadness on @entity30 , including a post on march 3 which read : ' in the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends			1
' @entity158 , a vice-principal at @entity51 , told @entity159 he could n’t comment on the case as the teenager had left more than a year ago			0
' our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time , ' a spokesman for the @entity163 said in a statement			0
' we are not going to respond directly to the family ’s comments as we do not want to add to their grief			0

@entity9 ' was raped by four classmates when she was 15 '
they ' took a photo of the attack and circulated it around the school '
classmates and friends *shunned* her and she was forced to leave
police investigated but did not press charges *due* to insufficient evidence
