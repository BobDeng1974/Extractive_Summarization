by @entity0 angry : @entity1 , 41 , says he was drugged and scammed out of $ 135,000 by strippers a cardiologist who is being sued for $ 135,000 in unpaid bills by a @entity6 strip club has detailed how he was allegedly lured into a stripper crime ring , drugged and then robbed of the sum			1
@entity1 , 41 , has accused @entity9 , 26 , @entity10 , 40 , and @entity11 , 28 , of slipping a substance into his drink before racking up the huge debts while he was unconscious or not in control of his actions			1
the three women worked for @entity18 , a strip club that is now suing @entity1 for the bill after he told @entity21 he had been swindled and they reversed the charges			1
but @entity1 has finally given his side of the story in papers filed in @entity27 and has blamed the club as well as the women , the @entity23 reported			2
' scores along with ( the dancers ) engaged in a conspiracy and scheme to steal money from @entity1 by drugging him , taking possession of his credit card without his knowledge or permission , and charging unauthorized and exorbitant amounts to that credit card , ' the court papers say			2
@entity1 , who is single , explained that he first became involved with the women when he went out to dinner with at a @entity45 restaurant and was approached by @entity9 , who claimed she was a nursing student			1
they swapped numbers and she later asked him out to dinner			0
they enjoyed several dinners together , as well as a concert , and on some occasions , she brought @entity11 and @entity10 with her , falsely claiming they were her relatives			2
' scam ' : he said he was approached by @entity9 , left , while out having dinner and they went out several times			2
she introduced him to 2 friends she claimed were relatives , including @entity11 , right during those evenings out , the women slipped a drug into his drink that ' caused him to enter a semi-conscious state , lose the ability to act voluntarily and make knowing decisions , as well as lose his memory , ' the suit claims			1
he said he was shocked when he got an @entity21 bill for $ 135,303.14 in charges to a strip club - which he did n't even remember going to			1
he reported the charges as fraudulent and @entity21 reversed the charges - which left scores and the three women irritated , he said			1
' @entity9 desperately attempted to persuade @entity1 to pay the amounts allegedly due to scores by claiming the charges were not fraudulent and that @entity18 had videotape of @entity1 at the club , ' the papers claim			1
' ringleader ' : she also introduced him to @entity10 , pictured , and as he partied with the three women , they drugged him and then used his credit card to rack up massive debts at a strip club , he said the women harrassed him with phone calls and text messages , he claimed , forcing him to tell @entity9 to make them stop , adding : ' i do n’t need to speak with swindlers			1
' but they did n't stop , and @entity18 staff also began contacting him , he said			0
the club then filed suit against him and argued that it had @entity1 on video four times over a 10 - day period in november handing out big tips and going to a private room with five women			0
their lawsuit alleges @entity1 ' voluntarily came to plaintiff ’s place of business and requested that plaintiff provide him with food , beverages and services '			0
costs at the club can certainly soar ; it costs you $ 20 to get through the door and bottles of champagne can sometimes cost more than $ 1,000			0
a meal at the club can cost $ 250 , and guests are allowed to leave tips for the dancers on their credit cards , the @entity23 previously reported			0
scene : the women allegedly took the doctor - and their other victims - to @entity18 , where they were scammed out of thousands on their credit cards			0
the club has denied they are to blame for the spending @entity1 , a cardiologist at @entity132 in @entity133 , is seeking unspecified money damages for battery , theft , conspiracy and defamation			2
@entity9 , @entity139 and @entity11 were arrested last month with two others for allegedly drugging and scamming wealthy men and scamming them out of almost $ 200,000			1
after their arrests , they were accused of prowling bars in @entity45 and @entity146 for their victims over a four month period beginning in september 2013			0
a banker , a lawyer and a real estate attorney were also among their alleged victims			0
no criminal charges have been filed against @entity18 but the investigation is ongoing			0
the club did not return @entity157 's call for comment .			0

@entity1 ' was approached by @entity9 , 26 , in a bar and asked him out on a date so she could scam him with two others strippers '
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 ' slipped a drug into his drink before taking him to a club where they charged him $ 135,000 '
he said he only became aware of his ' spending ' when he got an @entity21 bill and he got the charges reversed
the women and two others have been arrested in the ' scam ' but the club , which has sued @entity1 , claims he *readily* spent the money on strippers
