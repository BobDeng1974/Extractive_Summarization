train companies and energy firms have been urged to be ' socially responsible ' towards flood - hit customers hit by huge bills			1
@entity4 backed the idea of first class carriages being scrapped to make more room on disrupted trains for stand class ticket holders and urged power firms to consider waiving some charges for people who have been flooded out of their homes			1
the prime minister also insisted councils should not be charging residents in flood - hit areas for sandbags			1
strong winds and heavy rain across the @entity21 have caused major disruption across large parts of the rail network , including these commuters at @entity26 high winds , heavy rain , fallen trees and flood waters have hit train services across large parts of the country , with many trains cancelled or delayed			1
in many areas speed restrictions have been imposed , with just a fraction of the normal number of services running			2
it means those trains which are running are packed with commuters and people struggling to get to work or visit friends and family			1
those in standard class are forced to stand in increasingly cramped conditions , while first class carriages remain out of bounds			2
now the prime minister has agreed to discuss lifting restrictions on first class to make travelling on @entity21 ’s railways less uncomfortable			1
mr @entity4 was challenged during an interview on @entity56 , where he was told that just five trains an hour were running from @entity58 to @entity59 , compared to the usual 25 services			1
prime minister @entity4 asked if first class carriages should be opened up to all passengers , the @entity4 said : ‘ that ’s a very good suggestion which i will take that up with them			1
‘ i ’ll discuss that with @entity66 when we have the @entity69 meeting this afternoon			0
‘ what we need to do is recognise these are going to be very difficult times because there are only limited services that can be run			0
@entity66 and @entity75 are doing everything that they can			0
’ he also urged utility companies to consider cutting bills for people in flood - affected areas if they were unable to use their services			0
' they need to be socially responsible partners to their customers and they should be considering these things , particularly if people have n’t been able to use the services , ' he said			2
@entity4 said he would discuss scrapping first class rail restrictions at a meeting of the @entity69 emergency committee town halls must not charge for sandbags , @entity4 said today			2
the prime minister said councils could recoup the costs from central government			1
@entity98 in @entity99 has been asking locals to pay £ 30 for a ' flood pack ' of four standard sandbags and one to protect doorways			0
a spokesman said : ' the situation is that if an emergency is called then we will provide sandbags free of charge			0
' up until the end of last week , @entity110 was issuing free bags to local people - but asking them to pay for sand to go in them			0
a spokeswoman said it had now decided to be ' flexible ' about the policy			0
but writing on @entity119 , mr @entity4 said : ' i 've told local councils they should not charge for sandbags in flood - hit areas - central government will pick up the cost			0
' however , @entity127 leader @entity126 called on the prime minister to live up to his pledge to ensure money is no object in dealing with the relief effort			1
' we need the government to turn warm words into real action - from the provision of sandbags to getting our transport infrastructure up and running , to having the necessary investment we need in flood defence , ' mr @entity126 said			2
' the prime minister made big promises this week , now he ’s got to deliver on them			1
' the problem has been that the government has been too slow and inconsistent in its response			0
' train services hit by the atrocious weather include those run by @entity66 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity153			1

i have been on it for five hours '			0

' @entity66 is advising passengers not to travel , but has lifted ticket restrictions across the network until tomorrow			0
a spokesman said : ' we recently removed first class compartments on our local commuter trains to create more space for standard class customers			1
' in addition our train managers are already empowered to declassify first class carriages on our high speed trains as the need arises			1
' we are re-enforcing this message between @entity59 and @entity58 to make sure this happens when it is sensible to do so			1
' the service from @entity59 to @entity201 has been cancelled , but all other trains between @entity59 and @entity203 are still running and will call at @entity204			1
a half - hourly service will run between @entity59 and @entity206 , while service will run every hour from @entity59 and @entity208			1

trains between @entity228 and @entity229 may be delayed by up to 20 minutes because of a problem at a level crossing			0
labour leader @entity126 said the government had to turn warm words into action @entity155 and @entity153 trains between @entity236 and @entity238 / @entity237 will not run until at least 8am because of an overhead wire problem near @entity240 , while @entity155 , @entity242 and @entity151 services between @entity243 and @entity244 may be delayed because of overhead wire problems between these stations			0
trains between @entity248 and @entity249 have an 80mph speed restriction , meaning delays of up to 15 minutes			0
in @entity253 storm - force winds are expected to cause further delays today			0
trees on the line between @entity257 and @entity258 mean no trains will be running between these stations , while trains are suspended between @entity262 and @entity263 because of an obstructed line			2
buses will replace trains between @entity267 and @entity268 until noon because power cables have been blown on to the tracks between @entity267 and @entity271 no trains are running between @entity273 and @entity274 because of an overhead wire problem between the stations , which is not expected to be fixed until 8.30am .			2
