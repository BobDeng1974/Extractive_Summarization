by @entity0 published : 12:21 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 04:35 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 , a @entity4 astronaut onboard the @entity5 , has shared these incredible photos from his 200 - mile - high perch			1
the breathtaking images reveal an unrivalled view of aurora over @entity11 as well as an incredible shot of the moon setting on the @entity15 ’s blue atmosphere			1
‘ flew over fascinating aurora at south of @entity11 a few hours ago , ’ @entity3 tweeted yesterday , before posting these stunning shots of his view to his 71,000 - strong @entity19 army			1
' flew over fascinating aurora at south of @entity11 a few hours ago , ' astronaut @entity3 tweeted yesterday , before posting this stunning shot of his view to his 71,000 - strong @entity19 army an aurora is caused by collisions between electrons from space with the oxygen and nitrogen in @entity15 ’s upper atmosphere			1
the electrons - which come from the @entity15 ’s magnetosphere - transfer their energy to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms and molecules , making them ‘ excited ’			2
as the gases return to their normal state , they emit photons , small bursts of energy in the form of light to create the spectacular light shows that can be seen from @entity15			0
the @entity46 , known as the aurora australis , often take the shape of a curtain of light , or a sheet , when seen from @entity15			0
they are commonly seen as green and sometimes as red			0
like the @entity54 , the aurora australis is strongest in an oval centred on the south magnetic pole putting on stunning shows in the vast expanse of @entity59			0
when the solar cycle is near its maximum , the @entity46 can sometimes be in @entity62 , southern @entity11 as seen in these images , and southern @entity64 and @entity65			2
auroras are a spectacular sign that our planet is electrically connected to the sun. these light shows are provoked by energy from the sun and fuelled by electrically charged particles trapped in @entity15 ’s magnetic field			2
just as impressive was @entity3 's image of the moon setting in @entity15 's atmosphere , similar to another posted by the astronaut earlier this month an aurora , such as this one which took place over @entity11 , is caused by collisions between electrons from space with the oxygen and nitrogen in @entity15 's atmosphere the @entity46 can sometimes be in @entity62 , southern @entity11 as seen in these images , and southern @entity64 and @entity65 the electrons — which come from the @entity15 ’s magnetosphere — transfer their energy to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms and molecules , making them ‘ excited ’			1

just as impressive is @entity104 ’s image of the moon setting in @entity15 ’s atmosphere , similar to another posted by the astronaut earlier this month			1
in @entity104 ’s earlier image , the sun is behind the @entity15 , lighting a crescent of the moon and shining through the @entity15 ’s atmosphere			1
the lowest reaches of the atmosphere are red , because only the longest wavelengths of visible light , which are red , are n’t scattered by the dense air			0
the upper atmosphere , which is not at all dense , allows for the emission of even the shortest wavelengths of light , blue , indigo and violet			0
51 - year - old @entity3 is a @entity4 engineer and a veteran of four @entity124 missions , logging around five months in space			1

the images were taken by @entity4 astronaut , @entity3 , and shared with his 71,000 - strong @entity19 army
they *include* several shots of the @entity46 taken 200 miles above @entity15 on their way across @entity11
51 - year - old @entity3 also posted a stunning image of the moon setting in @entity15 ’s blue atmosphere
