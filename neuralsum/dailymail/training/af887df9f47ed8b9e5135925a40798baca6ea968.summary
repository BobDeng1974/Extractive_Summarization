glamorous in sequins and hats embellished with sprays of peacock feathers and lashings of lace , the stylish women of @entity1 were out in force as @entity9 at the @entity10 got underway			1
one of the oldest @entity13 race meetings , the @entity10 festival started life in 1776 and has since become a @entity16 institution - and a magnet for racing fans from all over the county			1
but although the going was good and the bookies busy , all eyes were instead on the colourfully dressed ladies as they descended on the racecourse dressed to impress in bold brights and chic monochrome ensembles			2
another looked wonderful in an all - lemon ensemble , while bright shades of crimson , royal blue and emerald green also looked super and certainly stood out from the rest			0
unfortunately not everyone displayed the same good taste , with one or two opting for ensembles better suited to clubbing with the heels to match , while some also sported enormous tattoos			0
nevertheless , with fashion scouts scouring the racecourse for the best dressed lady , the vast majority had clearly made a real effort to wow the judges and win the top prize of a holiday to @entity92			0
patriotic : a group of ladies do their bit for the @entity60 in fabulous blue , crimson and white ensembles on their day out on @entity9 at @entity1 's @entity99 going for gold : a lady looks lovely in an extravagant gold hat and navy blue lace dress while another was pretty in an all - lemon ensemble making an entrance : a lady is chic in a pretty coral dress , neat nude shoes and a matching hat , while her friend opted for a glamorous gold gown , black hat and shoes pulling out all the stops : with a trip to @entity92 the prize for the best - dressed racegoer , ladies arriving at the @entity99 had pulled out all the stops @entity121 might have the world 's biggest race in the shape of the @entity125 but @entity1 is just as prestigious and like its @entity127 competitor , has plenty to offer in the style stakes			1
both @entity121 , @entity1 and neighbouring @entity92 have relatively relaxed dress codes compared to @entity131 , although all three insist on guests making do without jeans and sportswear			2
as at @entity121 , @entity1 is a hotbed of northern glamour with short skirts and sky high heels regularly spotted in and around the paddock			2
colourful hats are a more recent innovation , although as today 's event demonstrates , the ladies of @entity1 know a thing or two when it comes to buying hats			1
indeed , with the majority of ladies arriving dressed to kill , organisers have decided it is male racegoers who require a bigger nudge , with the more specific rules laid out for men			0
for instance , while ladies must be ' smartly dressed ' , men are told to wear a jacket and tie in the @entity161 and a collared shirt in the @entity163 and in private boxes			0
in the @entity166 , however , no real dress code applies with even fancy dress allowed , provided you call the racecourse first and let them know what to expect			0
what 's tat ? a lady shows off her chic pheasant feather hat and floral tattoo , while another demonstrates how to do bold brights with aplomb looking lovely : a racegoer looks wonderful in monochrome dress and matching hat , a race day staple beloved of the queen and @entity184 among others @entity186 : as at @entity92 , @entity121 and @entity131 , peacock feather plumes proved popular among stylish racegoers , as did bold brights and even a dash or two of print lady in red : a glamorous racegoer shows off her classic red and black ensemble , complete with a crimson lace dress , an elegant pendant and a vast titfer going for bold : a lady opts for a large hat decorated with plumes of peacock feathers , while another chooses a revealing dress in a flattering shade of green the winner 's haul also includes a trip to @entity209 , while runners - up also get prizes and a place in @entity1 's # bestdressedselfie social media campaign			1
' @entity214 is the social highlight of the four day @entity10 with ladies from across @entity16 donning their most stylish outfits and hats and going all out to look their very best , ' explains @entity1 managing director , @entity219			2
' we â€™re delighted that sponsors @entity214 are providing us with another fantastic star prize of a trip to @entity92 which is guaranteed to be an added incentive for ladies to pull out all stops , get dressed up , enjoy a great day out at the races and have the chance of securing the coveted @entity191 crown			0
' the second day of the @entity10 race meeting , @entity9 brings more than 60,000 racing fans flocking to @entity1 as well as some of the world 's biggest racehorse owners			1
among them is sir @entity240 , who was spotted enjoying the action on day one , @entity237 's @entity236 and @entity238 , whose bay thoroughbred @entity242 will tackle the @entity243 at 3.45pm today			0
top notch : a lady looks lovely in a @entity246 inspired tartan ensemble while a trio of fellow guests arrive in classic black and white outfits in bloom : a lady arrives in a large peony - inspired hat coloured a delicate blush pink while a fellow racegoer is chic in classic black and white jazzed up with sequins big arrival : a lady dressed in an elaborate gold and black dress carries a chair to a better spot , while right , ladies in crimson and cream make their entrance great day out : a group of ladies indulge in a glass of @entity271 and scan the racecard as they wait for the first race of the day to get underway at @entity1 big beast : the @entity10 is one of the oldest race meetings in the @entity13 and attracts some of its best known owners such as the @entity238 and sir @entity240 ready for action : @entity279 , pictured on the first day of racing at the @entity99 , will be among the jockeys lining up as today 's races get underway			1
