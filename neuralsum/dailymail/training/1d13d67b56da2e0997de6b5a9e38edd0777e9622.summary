‘ and although he was a very silly , injudicious , and at that moment not very pleasant young guy , i do n’t actually think one tweet should ruin your job prospects			2
’ she added : ‘ in general , i am more concerned to be sure that people do n’t use the internet in this way ( or do n’t do so again ) than to seek “ punishment ”			0
