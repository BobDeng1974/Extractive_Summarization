by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 3 july 2013 this is the dramatic footage showing the moment a @entity4 lantern landed in a recycling plant , sparking a blaze which caused £ 6 million of damage			1
@entity8 have released @entity10 video clips showing a small flaming object which investigators say is a paper lantern floating into the @entity15 recycling facility on an industrial estate in @entity17 , near @entity18			1
the resulting fire ripped through 100,000 plastic bales which were awaiting recycling , sending a column of smoke 6,000ft into the sky			1
mr @entity40 said he was satisfied after preliminary investigations that the cause of the fire was the lantern caught on the site 's own cctv cameras			1
the blaze sparked calls for @entity4 lanterns to be banned , with senior @entity63 mp @entity62 saying they were ' immensely dangerous '			1
the mp , who has been campaigning for some time against their use because of farmers ' concerns in his @entity70 constituency about the impact on crops and livestock , said it had taken a major incident in an urban area to bring home the dangers of the lanterns			2
aerial photo of the fire at the 13 - acre @entity15 recycling site , which suffered the biggest fire that the @entity49 fire service has ever tackled preliminary investigations blame that the cause of the fire on the lantern caught on the site 's own cctv cameras the blaze sparked calls for @entity4 lanterns to be banned , with mps branding them as ' immensely dangerous ' he added it was ' extremely lucky ' that no one was killed			1
yesterday , @entity96 mp @entity30 said the lanterns were ' just not safe ' , and also called for a ban			2
mr @entity40 said the @entity99 ( @entity100 ) - of which he is president - previously called for a review of the use of the lanterns and said it was time that ' sensible people have a sensible discussion ' about the issue			2
' we do n't want to be party poopers and we know they are used in a lot of celebrations , ' he said			0
he added : ' we have a situation where a fire has started here , £ 6 million worth of loss , started by one of these lanterns and that was eminently preventable			1
' the @entity100 said it wanted an ' urgent review ' of the law over the use of paper lanterns , while farming , agricultural and maritime groups called for measures to curb their use			1
farmers with livestock have complained that spent lanterns often land in fields where their wires can injure animals , while coastguards have reported incidents when they have been needlessly called out on false alarms when the lanterns have been mistaken for ship distress flares			2
the @entity17 fire , in which 11 firefighters suffered minor injuries , continues to burn today with the fire service estimating crews could be at the site until at least tomorrow			2
mr @entity62 , who is mp for @entity145 and @entity146 and @entity63 party president , told the @entity149 4 today programme : ' it is laudable for governments to take their time and be cautious about banning things but the evidence now very strongly points towards that ban			0
' this could be repeated again and it could have a loss of life attached to it which would be an absolutely appalling tragedy			0
' i think all of us would feel utterly , utterly appalling if we had failed to take action when we had the chance			0
' paper lanterns have been blamed for causing a myriad of problems			1
farmers with livestock complain lanterns often land in fields where their wires can injure animals , while coastguards say they have been needlessly called out when the lanterns have been mistaken for ship distress flares @entity176 ( @entity100 ) has called for a review of the use of the lanterns and said it was time that ' sensible people have a sensible discussion ' about the issue the blaze , which started on sunday , demanded more than 200 firefighters to tackle the flames he went on : ' they are spectacular things so i am loath to ban them or to seek to ban them			1
but they are immensely dangerous			0
' the @entity193 , who are a pretty fun - loving group , have banned them in recent years as well because of the impact on livestock , on crops and indeed property and potentially the threat to life			0
' he added : ' the clamour for action to be taken has come originally from the farming community			0
it has taken an incident like this in an urban environment to really bring this to the headlines			0
' i do n't think governments should be knee - jerk in outlawing things but , if you look back , i have been doing this for some time alongside others , like the @entity218			0
' i think the majority of mps have perhaps only become aware of this recently because the majority of @entity220 do n't represent rural constituencies where this is deemed to be a bigger threat			0
' @entity226 played down calls for a ban			0
' the actual number of fires caused by @entity4 lanterns is very small , ' a @entity230 spokesman said			1
' it is important that we always ensure that there is a proportionate response to any event and we always look at safety matters and make sure they are kept at the top of our concerns			0
