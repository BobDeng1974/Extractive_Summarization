by @entity0 @entity1 suffered liver failure after taking low - dose antibiotics for three years to prevent bladder infections a mother who took an antibiotic tablet every day claims she almost died after the drug triggered liver disease			1
@entity1 , 36 , had been taking low - dose antibiotics for three years to prevent recurrent bladder infections			1
but she was rushed to hospital in april last year when the whites of her eyes and her skin turned bright yellow			1
doctors discovered she had liver failure and ms @entity18 claims she was nicknamed ' @entity19 ' by hospital staff because of her jaundiced skin caused by the disease			1
thanks to a liver transplant she survived , but the effects have left her feeling ' like an old lady in a young woman ’s body '			1
ms @entity18 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , was prescribed the low - dose antibiotics after suffering recurring bladder infections			1
' my doctor prescribed me this antibiotic on a low dose to stop me getting them , ' she said			1
' i had to take one tablet a night and had been taking them for about three years			2
in some women , taking such a dose can reduce the occurrence of bladder infections by up to 95 per cent			1
but of all types of prescription drugs , antibiotics are the ones most likely to cause liver damage , according to a study published in the journal @entity51			1
ms @entity18 said : ' i did n't give the fact [ i had been taking them so long ] a second thought , as my doctor had prescribed them			2
i thought they were safe			0
' but she was forced to return to the doctor in april last year after she began to feel unwell and vomit			0
her doctor suspected she had a gut infection and prescribed antibiotics , but two days later - when her skin turned yellow - she was rushed to hospital			1
ms @entity18 , who lives with fiance @entity64 , says : ' at the hospital , they took my bloods and then i saw a doctor who sent me home and told me to return four days later for an ultrasound			0
' ms @entity18 , 36 , was given a massive dose of steroids to fight the liver damage			1
she is now out of the danger zone but suffers many side - effects as a result of them , including a bloated face , bad acne , weight gain , and muscle pain and weakness that has left her wheelchair bound ( pictured left with medications to treat these symptoms ) but when mr @entity64 woke up the following morning to see her skin become bright yellow , he took her straight to @entity87			1
this time , she was admitted immediately and a blood test revealed that her liver inflammation results were in the thousands - when the normal marker should have been about 40			1
ms @entity18 claims she was told the low - dose antibiotic she had been taking was most likely responsible for triggering the liver disease			1
looking back , she said she had been feeling exhausted , but had blamed it on juggling family life with full - time work			2
by the time she was diagnosed her condition was so dire she was referred to @entity97 in @entity98 and put on the liver transplant list			2
she said : ' i was so yellow that the nurses started calling me @entity19 out of the @entity102 and @entity64 began calling me " @entity103 " because of my black bob and yellow skin			2
' we kept our humour and positivity throughout it all			0
you have to keep smiling as , if you did n’t , it would all get too much for you			0
' i started thinking about the future if anything happened to me and it got to the point where i sorted out wills and where the children would go			0
all i was thinking about was @entity64 and my children			0
' ms @entity18 said : ' i was so yellow that the nurses started calling me @entity19 out of the @entity102 ' ( pictured ) remarkably , ms @entity18 , who has two teenage children - @entity121 , 17 and @entity122 , 13 - says she managed to pull through without a liver transplant , thanks to intensive steroid treatment			1
but she added her life has changed dramatically and her mobility has been reduced			0
when she left hospital , she could barely walk and tests showed she had steroid induced myopathy - when the steroids weaken the muscles			1
ms @entity18 , a former project manager , said : ' i had all the side effects you get with the steroids , including a bloated face , bad acne , weight gain , not being able to walk and immense pain throughout my body			2
' when i came off the steroids , my walking still was n’t great and they are currently doing further tests as they believe the trauma may have kick - started another disorder			2
' fifteen months on , she says she still feels ' horrendous '			0
“ my mobility is still affected and although i am ok pottering around at home , when i go out , i have to use a wheelchair			0
' i feel exhausted and suffer from chronic body pain which i have to take medication for			0
' i really have to pace myself			0
i lost my job because of being poorly as i had to have so much time off and i would not be able to do that job now anyway			0
feel like an old lady in a young woman ’s body			0
' she is now trying to raise awareness of the damage antibiotics can cause			2
' my aim is to raise awareness of non-alcohol related liver disease and people like myself where taking prescription medication brought on the condition			0
' i think anyone on regular prescribed medication should have regular blood tests to check body function to make sure they are not having an adverse effect			0

@entity1 was prescribed low - dose antibiotics , which she took for 3 years
pills were to help prevent the recurring bladder infections she suffered
but after three years , her skin turned yellow - she had liver failure
was *pumped* full of steroids to try and repair the damage , and survived
but mother - of - two says she has been left wheelchair - bound as a result
*research* *suggests* antibiotics are drugs most likely to cause liver problems
