' @entity0 , head of the @entity9 , said in a 19 - minute audiotape released online yesterday : ' muslims , rush to your state			1
yes , it is your state			0
' in the audio , posted on militant websites which have been used by the group before , the leader makes a special call to those with practical skills - such as scholars , judges , doctors , engineers and people with military and administrative expertise - to come ' answer the dire need of the @entity5 for them '			1
urging @entity5 around the world to travel to the @entity38 to join the @entity13 state , @entity36 goes on to say : ' @entity40 , because @entity41 is not for the @entity41 and @entity2 is not for the @entity2 '			1
he also calls on jihadi fighters to increase fighting in the holy month of @entity44 , which began on sunday			0
he said : ' in this virtuous month or in any other month , there is no deed better than jihad in the path of @entity14 , so take advantage of this opportunity and walk the path of you righteous predecessors			0
' so to arms , to arms , soldiers of the @entity13 , fight , fight			0
' the tape was released online two days after the organisation unilaterally declared the establishment of an @entity13 state , or caliphate , in the land it controls , changing its name to the @entity1			1
it also proclaimed @entity0 the caliph - the head of state in a caliphate - and demanded that all @entity5 around the world pledge allegiance to him			2
the voice resembled that on other audiotapes said to be by @entity36 , an @entity2 militant who has rarely been photographed or appeared in public			0
meanwhile , claims have emerged that @entity9 militants , which are continuing to advance in @entity41 , are in possession of a massive long - distance ballistic missile			1
missile : photographs show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by masked men in the @entity41 city of @entity85 - the proclaimed capital of the new @entity88 caliphate mystery : it is not known how the weapon ended up in the hands of @entity9 , but social media accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in @entity2 and @entity41 claimed they are now preparing it for use announcement : @entity9 militants ( pictured ) are celebrating the establishment of a caliphate , or @entity13 state , in the vast stretches of the @entity38 that have fallen under its control upon declaring a caliphate , the @entity88 militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in @entity2 and @entity41 has been branded too extreme even by @entity111 - demanded allegiance from @entity5 around the world photographs show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by masked men in the @entity41 city of @entity85 - the proclaimed capital of the new @entity88 caliphate			1
supporters of the jihadist group said the missile was a scud , although experts analysing the images believe the weapon is almost certainly inoperable and highly unlikely to pose a threat			2
the leader made a special call to those with practical skills to ' answer the dire need of the @entity5 for them ' the weapon pictured being paraded by @entity9 militants in @entity85 is believed to have been captured from another rebel group , the @entity132			1
the @entity132 are understood to have acquired the @entity134 - built missile when it captured a military base from government forces in the @entity137 of @entity41 last september			2
it is not known how the weapon ended up in the hands of @entity9 , but social media accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in @entity2 and @entity41 claimed they are now preparing it for use			1
' @entity145 ( @entity146 ) has scud missile in # @entity85			2
[ @entity150 willing ] its heading towards # @entity151 for a spectacular @entity152 , ' an @entity9 suspporter calling himself @entity149 said on @entity153			0
a number of experts have poured cold water on the idea that the missile could be a threat , however			0
@entity160 , a blogger who tracks munitions used in @entity41 , tweeted : ' the only danger that @entity1 scud is to anyone at the moment is if they accidentally run over a pedestrian showing it off			1
' meanwhile @entity168 - an expert on the @entity41 conflict who works at the at the @entity173 research organisation - called the missile 99 per cent useless , according to the @entity174			2
this morning , @entity2 's newly elected members of parliament attended their first government session in @entity179 's heavily fortified @entity178			0
the new parliament ended its inaugural session by failing to make any progress in choosing a new prime minister - even as the country faces a militant blitz that threatens to rip it apart			0
world leaders and senior clerics have urged @entity2 's fractious politicians to unite in the face of the militant onslaught , which has killed more than 2,000 people , displaced hundreds of thousands and polarised the country 's @entity195 , @entity88 and @entity196 populations			0
new era : news that @entity9 had declared its territory a caliphate was described by one expert , @entity168 , as ' the most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11 caliphate : a map purportedly showing the areas @entity9 plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online			0
as well as the @entity38 , @entity210 and large areas of @entity212 , it also reveals @entity9 ' ambition to extend into @entity214			0
@entity215 , which was @entity88 - ruled until the late 15th century , would form part of the caliphate , as would the @entity219 states and eastern @entity214 , up to and including @entity220 extremist : a gun - brandishing @entity222 loyal to @entity9 celebrates the formation of the @entity1 by waving an jihadist flag in the @entity41 city of @entity85 on sunday			1
the area is considered the capital of the @entity1 @entity2 's newly elected members of parliament attend their first government session in the heavily fortified @entity178 in @entity179 this morning @entity2 's new parliament ended its inaugural session today by failing to make any progress in choosing a new prime minister - even as the country faces a militant blitz that threatens to rip it apart on sunday @entity9 declared they had changed their name to the @entity1 and announced that the areas of @entity2 and @entity41 under their control represent the establishment of a caliphate			1
the news was described by mr @entity168 as the ' most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11 '			0
upon declaring a caliphate , the @entity88 militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in @entity2 and @entity41 has been branded too extreme even by @entity111 - demanded allegiance from @entity5 around the world			1
with brutal efficiency , @entity9 has carved out a large chunk of territory that has effectively erased the border between @entity2 and @entity41 and laid the foundations of its proto - state			1
now that it feels it has secure the territory under its control , the group announced it would be changing its name from the @entity9 ( also known as the @entity3 ) , to just the @entity1 , in order to appear less regional			2
a spokesman for @entity9 declared the group 's chief , @entity0 , as the leader of the new caliphate and called on @entity5 everywhere , not just those in areas under the organization 's control , to swear loyalty to him			2
' the legality of all emirates , groups , states and organizations becomes null by the expansion of the caliph 's authority and the arrival of its troops to their areas , ' said @entity285			0
' listen to your caliph and obey him			0
support your state , which grows every day , ' he added in an audio statement posted online			0
@entity290 loosely defined the state territory as running from northern @entity41 to the @entity2 province of @entity293 - a vast stretch of land straddling the border that is already largely under @entity9 control .			1
