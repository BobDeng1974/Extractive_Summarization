by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 11 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:37 est , 11 november 2013 the @entity4 app for @entity5 and @entity6 , pictured , uses a smartphone camera to scan an area for local gamma radiation levels many everyday items give out small amounts of radiation but if you ’re concerned about exactly how much your body is being exposed to , there ’s now an app that will tell you			1
@entity4 , designed by @entity18 - based developers @entity19 , uses a smartphone camera to scan an area for local gamma radiation			1
the app was created with support from the @entity25 and was successfully tested during recent military exercises			2
‘ the @entity4 app turns your phone into a detector of ionizing radiation , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ this is n't one of those fake @entity33 counters			0
' @entity4 uses scanning technology that analyses videos and photos taken using a smartphone ’s camera			1
the camera looks for a particular ‘ signature ’ left behind by gamma rays , similar to how a @entity33 counter or other radiation scanner works			1
it measures the rate at which these rays hit the camera ’s sensor to determine radiation levels and will warn users if they are being exposed to harmful rays			1
the technology and software can also be used with images from surveillance cameras and webcams			0
@entity19 said : ‘ the technology is sensitive enough to detect , within seconds , dangerously high levels of radiation so that you can quickly get away			1
’ it added the software also collects and saves radiation records , from minutes to hours , to detect weaker radioactivity sources or normal background radioactivity			2
@entity4 can additionally be used to detect ‘ radioactivity in everyday life ’ such as exposure on airplanes , from medical patients or from contaminated products			1
the app measures the rate at which gamma rays hit the smartphone camera ’s sensor during a scan , to determine radiation levels			1
a full scan takes around five minutes , pictured left , but will warn a user immediately if a dangerous amount is detected			0
scans can also be recorded and stored , pictured right in military and federal tests it has been used to detect hazards from simulated terrorist attacks , dirty bombs , or hidden radioactive materials			0
one recent test took place at the @entity92 's @entity91 training grounds			0
a town was made to look like it had been hit by a twister and the first trainees to arrive on site used @entity4 to scan for radiation			1
these scans were then sent to a central command post thought software called @entity101 , currently used to share information with the authorities following a natural disaster			0
image insight said users can scan an area and receive a complete radiation reading within five minutes , although dangerous levels will be reported as soon as they are detected			2
a similar app called @entity112 app , pictured , was rejected by @entity113 because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts			2
@entity113 said the app could confuse users and potentially frighten them and this was irresponsible the developers were tasked with creating the app three years ago under a $ 679,000 contract with the @entity25 ( @entity25 )			0
insight also got funding and support from the @entity127 @entity126 , the @entity128 ( @entity127 @entity129 ) , and the @entity130 ( @entity131 )			0
it has now been made available to the public for @entity5 and @entity6 phones and tablets and costs £ 3.21 or £ 2.99 on the respective app stores			0
@entity113 has previously rejected radiation scanning apps from its store , including the @entity112 , for being ' irresponsible '			0
@entity140 's app was rejected because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts , which @entity113 said could confuse users and potentially frighten them			2
image insight is working on an additional feature for @entity4 that lets users upload data , log onto forums and compare readings with others in a particular area to help establish which locations are safe or unsafe .			0
