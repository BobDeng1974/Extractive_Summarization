the hermit thrush may well be the @entity2 of the bird world thanks to its tuneful melodies , a study has revealed			2
scientists have discovered that the @entity7 songbird sings in ' harmonic series ' , a pattern of pleasing - sounding notes commonly used in popular human music			1
by studying how birds sing , experts hope to learn how much of human musical heritage is shaped by biology , compared to culture			1
ultimate songbird ? scientists have discovered that the hermit thrush ( @entity19 ) pictured , sings in harmonic series , which is a component in popular human music			1
a harmonic series stems from a base note and is followed by notes that increase in pitch , based on multiples of the original note a harmonic series stems from a base note and is followed by notes that increase in pitch , based on multiples of the original note			1
scientists found that around 70 per cent of the bird ’s songs followed this pattern , @entity31 reported			2
male hermit thrushes ( @entity19 ) sing between six and 10 types of song , which tend to be high - pitched and fast , beginning with a long whistle , the study revealed			1
@entity41 , a composer at @entity42 in @entity43 and @entity44 , a biologist at the @entity45 , analysed 144 different song types from 14 male hermit thrushes			1
experts found that 70 per cent of the hermit thrush 's ( pictured ) songs were based on notes in a harmonic series , making them similar to human compositions ‘ listening to the songs full speed , they are very attractive , but we did n’t have any inkling that we would hear the harmonic series in them , ' dr @entity41 said			1
but after they slowed them down , the harmonic series patterns became clear and statisticians analysed the bird ’s choices of pitch in the song			1
around 70 per cent of the songs analysed followed harmonic intervals , compared to just five per cent which seemed to include random notes			1
scientists are interested in why the bird sings in this way , because the bird ’s vocal tract is not specially designed to produce the specific notes in the series			0
they believe that female hermit thrushes may pick their mate by his harmonic accuracy – or the combination of notes may simply be easier for them to remember , just as they are for humans			1
dr @entity41 emphasised that the birds do n’t deliberately compose their songs using scales , but noted that other birds also like intervals used in human music			2
for example , previous studies have shown that musical wrens use them and domestic chickens favour consonant notes – a combination of notes that sound pleasant when played at the same time			0
dr @entity41 said : ‘ the harmonic series is a physical phenomenon , not a culturally specific construct , like any scale , so it makes sense that this could be found in songs of a variety of different species			1
’ she believes that because humans share musical characteristics with other species , there may be something in our shared biology that makes certain note combinations attractive			2
the research was published in the journal @entity116			0
@entity118 has an estimated 421 million fewer birds than three decades ago , researchers claim			0
experts blame modern farming methods and the loss and damage of habitats for falling numbers of many common species , according to the paper published in science journal @entity129			0
‘ this is a warning from birds throughout @entity118			0
it is clear that the way we are managing the environment is unsustainable for many of our most familiar species , ’ said @entity130 of the @entity131 , which co-led the study			0
‘ the conservation and legal protection of all birds and their habitats in tandem are essential to reverse declines			0
’ the study found that about 90 per cent of the decline occurred in the most common bird species , including grey partridges , skylarks , sparrows and starlings			2
meanwhile the population of some rarer birds had increased in recent years , probably due to conservation efforts and legal protections			0
@entity158 of the @entity159 , who was involved in the study , said : ‘ significant loss of common birds could be quite detrimental to human society			0
’ the scientists estimated the loss of bird populations by analysing data on 144 species of @entity118 birds , collected from surveys in 25 countries			0
they have called for increased conservation through urban green space projects and environmental farmland schemes .			0

researchers from the @entity42 in @entity43 and the @entity45 , analysed 144 song types from 14 male hermit thrushes
they discovered they sing in harmonic series 70 per cent of the time
a harmonic series 0 used in popular music - stems from a base note and is followed by notes that increase in pitch , based on multiples of the original
studying the bird 's innate musical taste , which is also seen in other bird species , hints that human music is a mixture of biology and culture
