by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 14:26 est , 27 january 2014 victim : @entity3 , 6 , died after being struck by a driver who was waiting to pick up an @entity6 client on @entity7 car service app @entity6 is now facing its first major legal hurdle after being named in a wrongful death lawsuit after one of its drivers hit and killed a 6 - year - old girl			1
@entity3 died on @entity7 after an @entity6 driver , @entity16 , hit her and injured her mother and brother			1
the suit was filed in @entity20 today meaning the company faces its first true test as it argues that they are not responsible for the driver since he did not have an @entity6 customer in the vehicle at the time of the accident			1
@entity6 is an app that allows users to call a car to their location , and drivers can log into the service whenever they want to receive clients			1
the ' free market ' approach to this issue is important because it is up to the drivers when they want to participate - as opposed to a typical livery company where the drivers clock in and clock out at set times			0
instead , the only similar aspect that the company has is the fact that drivers are technically ' logged in ' to the @entity6 app from the moment they put themselves on the virtual map for users to call them			1
the larger question that looms over the wrongful death case is who should be in charge of regulating @entity6 ? and when does the company stop being responsible - or , in this case , start being responsible - for the behavior of their drivers , who essentially work on a freelance basis ? mr @entity16 had been working for the company for one month at the time of the accident , at which point he was arrested for suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and cooperated with the police throughout the investigation			1
even though mr @entity16 's income from @entity6 was his main livelihood , the company did not view or treat him any differently from other drivers - some of whom may work for a number of car services at the same time			1
the company maintains that the use of the app does not make them liable , but the victim 's mother believes it does			0
the @entity108 reports that the family 's lawyer , @entity75 , argues in the suit that the app does is not compatible with hands - free technology , meaning that while the drivers are logged in - responding to a taxi request or simply waiting until they get a call - they are unable to use a hands - free tool			2
drawing a line : the company 's co-founder @entity120 , seen here in @entity123 in 2012 , says that the company is not responsible for the drivers using their app when they do not have a passenger in the car ' @entity130 € ™ s claims that they are not responsible for injuries caused by @entity6 drivers who are logged on to the system but not carrying a fare flies in the face of hundreds of years of law , ' mr @entity75 told the paper			1
' new technology does not eliminate well - established legal principles			0
' the family is suing uber and the driver , mr @entity141 , for wrongful death , negligence , negligent hiring , and negligent infliction of emotional distress			2
' cabdrivers who are looking for fares are scanning the streets			0
uber drivers looking for fares are looking at their phones , ' mr @entity75 said			0
one of the lawsuit 's main points is that @entity6 's parent company ' is the insurance certificate holder for the insurance that @entity6 is required to carry as a @entity158 by the ( @entity159 ) , which it uses for its @entity162 operations '			2
they are calling for a jury trial and have not set an amount of compensation that they hope to be awarded			0
grieving : the @entity168 are suing @entity6 and the driver , mr @entity141 , for wrongful death , negligence , negligent hiring , and negligent infliction of emotional distress @entity120 , the man who founded @entity6 four years ago , got ' testy ' when questioned about the case in an earlier @entity108 interview			2
this is not the only public relations issue that @entity6 faces at the moment , but after it was valued at $ 4billion , the co-founders are taking each threat to their power as a serious concern			0
he would not speak about the case specifically - likely for legal reasons - but said that the company has since deactivated @entity188 € ™ s account and he has not been able to drive any other @entity6 clients ever since the accident			2
' we work our butts off to go above and beyond what is expected even by the regulators , including insurance , background checks , ' mr @entity120 said			0
' and so it always comes back to , did @entity6 do something wrong ? '			0

car service app is now facing a wrongful death lawsuit after an accident ended with 6 - year - old @entity3 dead and her mother and brother injured
@entity206 was waiting to pick up a client on @entity7 in @entity20 when he hit and killed the girl
he was logged into the @entity6 app but the company argues that because he did not have a client in the vehicle , they are not responsible
questions raised over how @entity6 is run and what responsibility they hold to their drivers who use the app as their main *source* of finding clients
