by @entity0 a retired police officer took drastic action to protect himself and his own pet from his neighbour 's dog by smashing it repeatedly over the head before stabbing it to death			1
former @entity11 homicide detective @entity10 , 55 , says he killed the large bull terrier cross when it climbed over his fence and attacked him and his dog @entity16			1
mr @entity10 has said he had no option but to hack @entity18 to death in his kitchen , but his owners say they are ' very upset ' and police are now investigating what happened			1
stabbing : former @entity11 homicide detective @entity10 says his neighbour 's dog attacked him and his pet @entity16 so he hacked it to death accusations : @entity18 was described a being ' possessed ' and a ' monster ' but his bereft owners have claimed there is no indication there was a struggle on wednesday weapons : mr @entity10 used these kitchen knives to stab the large bull terrier cross to death in his home the incident unfolded on wednesday when the dog climbed into mr @entity10 's garden			1
he says he ran back into his house but his own pet @entity16 came out to protect him and the neighbour 's animal grabbed it by the throat			1
the father - of - three then lifted two terracotta paving slabs from his patio and beat it over the head and when the fight spilled into the kitchen he grabbed a small vegetable knife and stabbed its back so many times the blade broke			1
he then got a bigger knife and stabbed him until the ' massive ' white animal was dead			2
mr @entity10 , of @entity60 , @entity61 , who worked for the @entity62 and the homicide squad at the @entity64 , said he had no choice			2
he said : ' all of a sudden , i could see this head poking over the fence - it was about the size of a lion 's			2
' it climbed over the fence and then started towards me			0
i could see it was going to attack me because it was coming at me with such force so i ran towards the house			0
' i could n't believe it when @entity16 just turned up out nowhere and totally intercepted the attack - getting mauled in the process			2
' the dog was trying to rip @entity16 apart - it just went straight for the throat with its fangs and began biting			1
gripe : the former detective says he saw the dog 's head look over the fence before the alleged struggle death : after he smashed @entity18 repeatedly over the head the fight spread into the kitchen where the dog died violent : the terrier was stabbed with such force that the knife 's blade broke in its chest ' @entity16 tried to defend himself but it was clear the dog was n't going to let go , so i picked up this massive paving slab and smashed it over the dog 's back three times			1
' any other dog would 've died but this one just kept going like it was possessed or something - the monster did n't even flinch			0
brave : @entity16 rushed to defend his master , who says his dog would have certainly died had he not intervened ' it just pulled @entity114 into the kitchen by his throat - leaving scrape marks on the floor - and i followed behind trying to figure out what to do			1
' i hit the dog again with a paving slab , which smashed into three pieces , and got worried because it did n't do anything so grabbed a vegetable knife with a four inch blade			1
' i just kept thinking ' this dog is going to kill @entity16 and then me ' so i stabbed it about three or four times in the chest but the knife just snapped in half			1
' mr @entity10 added : ' the whole thing must have only lasted for about five minutes but it felt like a lifetime because we were fighting for our lives - it might as well been a human who had come in			2
' i was in a state of absolute shock			0
i spent 30 years on the police force and was in the murder squad for half of that and i have never been so terrified in my life and also never felt so alone			2
' thank @entity16 was there because that monster would have killed me			1
the dog had to be killed in order for me to get help			2
i was completely and utterly terrified			0
' just days before the attack on wednesday , the dog - which @entity10 says is five times bigger than a normal @entity148 - had already jumped into the garden and attacked @entity114			1
following the second attack @entity10 was left almost unharmed but his dog @entity16 received puncture wounds to his neck and side from bite marks			1
@entity156 , whose grandson @entity157 owned the dog , said : ' we are all in complete shock			0
' @entity18 was being used as a guard dog , which we did n't like so we rescued it about two years ago			1
' on wednesday , the dog just obviously got into the garden again and the man stabbed him			0
' my grandson went berserk when we found out			0
there was no barking or any others signs to indicate there had been a struggle			0
' our dog might attack a cat or a dog like any pet might but you do n't expect your neighbour to kill it			2
it 's chilling really and we 're very upset			0
' damage : the former @entity11 officer smashed the dog over the head with tiles before stabbing it - sending blood over his home in @entity187 the @entity64 today confirmed they are investigating the incident			1
