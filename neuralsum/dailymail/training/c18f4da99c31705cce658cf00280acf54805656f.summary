of all the endurance rallies around the world , @entity0 is known as the deadliest , most dangerous - and many say , most fun			1
it has the largest following of all , and more than 80 per cent of competitors are amateurs who pay handsomely for the privilege of taking part			0
and they know they might not even make it past the first stage			0
terrains are much tougher than at any other rally			0
beastly off - road vehicles struggle to pass even the first stage , battling with salt , mud , dunes , rocks , and sky - high altitudes			1
every year the pictures that emerge from the spectacular event look more dramatic , more dangerous ... and more enticing			0
but if it was easy - if it was feasibly doable - it would n't be a @entity0			1
serious competitors spend many months leading up to the race preparing for the toughest parts of the course : getting fit spinning at the gym , wearing oxygen masks for high altitude , and trying to figure out the route			0
all the information they 're allowed to navigate them through the race is a rolling paper guide connected to the wheels detailing kilometres and direction			0
many do n't stand a chance , but they ca n't get enough			0
as ex-sponsored female competitor @entity77 , stunning and fearless , who 's completed four @entity78 , says : ' i do n't really like cars			0
i just f * * * * * * love @entity0			1
' who says it 's a man 's world ? i joined five - time reigning champions @entity40 for the first few days of the world 's most dangerous rally raid			1
luckily for me , i started at the first section , taking me from a glamorous launch in @entity89 up to rough and tough racing in @entity91 , in the west of the country			1
on the day of the launch , main roads were closed and people lined up behind the metal barricades to catch a glimpse of the parade locals with their babies and pushchairs came to see the motorsport superstars , various street food stations had popped up everywhere on the day before the launch , busy and bustling @entity89 fell silent as locals stayed at home			1
main roads were closed and lined with metal barricades			0
in a huge city centre , this is something only really seen at sporting events with the grandiose of @entity112			0
and the following day , the city came alive			2
locals with their babies and pushchairs came to see the motorsport superstars ( most of them self - styled ) soak up their glory			2
entire families piled along every barricade and barrier , eagerly awaiting their arrival ; it was clear the @entity50 like cars just as much as football			0
a parade was due to start , ending in the town square where each of the 414 bike , quad , car and truck competitors were to mount the podium			2
first are those who paid to take part ( about 80 per cent ; fees start at £ 11,000 just to register a bike ) , then , last year 's sponsored and professional competitors , and finally the 2014 winners			2
@entity0 merchandise and party paraphernalia sellers lined the pavement , various street food stations had popped up everywhere			2
the atmosphere is like @entity144 's @entity143 x 10 - and the showgirls are the sort made of ten tonnes of steel with sponsor logos slapped across their shiny bits , hooting for attention			2
2014 winner @entity151 and copilot @entity152 arrive at the podium in their @entity154 the rolling paper guide detailing kilometres and direction ( l ) and @entity158 meets @entity39 at the bivouac each of the 414 motorbike , quad bike , car and truck competitors were to mount the podium and soak up their glory the atmosphere was like @entity144 's @entity143 times 10 - and the showgirls were the sort made of up to ten tonnes of steel car @entity172 1 301 @entity39 ( @entity173 ) 2 303 @entity174 ( @entity175 ) 3 307 @entity176 ( @entity177 ) truck @entity172 1 507 @entity179 ( @entity180 ) 2 502 @entity181 ( @entity180 ) 3 500 @entity182 ( @entity180 ) bike @entity172 1 1 @entity183 ( @entity184 ) 2 7 paulo @entity185 ( @entity186 ) 3 26 @entity187 ( @entity188 ) @entity189 @entity172 1 251 @entity190 ( @entity177 ) 2 261 jeremias @entity191 ( @entity192 ) 3 283 @entity193 ( @entity194 ) the race is in its sixth year starting in @entity196 after terror threats in @entity198 drove it out of its @entity201 home			2
the only ' @entity0 ' left in the race is the @entity203 , a meeting place for the competitors ( located in @entity89 )			1
but while there may no longer be threats of terrorism putting drivers at risk , the race course remains as dangerous as ever , changing vastly each year , with challenging altitudes and extreme terrain putting the baddest cars to the ultimate test			0
watching the event unfold first hand was heart - stopping			0
on the very first day @entity151 , 2014 @entity0 champion , a firm favourite to win again , broke down after 10km			1
but @entity40 were still in the lead with several drivers in the top 20 of the car category			2
the @entity40 off - road rally car has been developed and redeveloped for years now ; and has been customised by genius engineers into somewhat of a transformer			1
a beast almost impossible to better			0
mini driver @entity39 led the race throughout and was crowned overall 2015 champion when the rally ended two weeks later , on january 17			0
we witnessed the drivers battle it out in the desert close up and in astounding luxury on our tour			2
owned by the @entity237 aso ( @entity236 ) - @entity0 was devised by a @entity237 after all , with the start point being @entity239 , back in 1978 - the @entity241 tours are run by sister company @entity242 , @entity0 's very own travel agent			1
i joined one such three - day @entity242 tour at the start of the rally taking me from @entity89 to @entity91 and back again			1
it was vip luxury and up - close action all the way - somewhat of an oxymoron - including a fascinating tour of a bivouac			1
the ginormous mobile service station and base camp is where all weary heroes head for food , rest , and to fix up their ride			0
hundreds of huge trucks full of mechanics and spare parts are stationed nearby daily along each stage of the race			0
two bivouacs are built at any one time and take three days to erect			0
we were lucky enough to get to look around and see car doctors mend the machines and even dine with the drivers			0
we were lucky enough to get to look around and see car doctors mend the machines while car nuts do come on @entity242 tours , their main customers are cash - rich sponsors			1
@entity0 sponsors such as @entity281 and @entity282 make up 45 per cent of customers while competitor sponsors such as @entity40 make up 38 per cent			1
friends and family of those competing , plus ' passionate people ' , as @entity285 says , make up 15 per cent			0
it 's a flat fee for everyone			0
of 350 @entity242 guests each year , there are about 10 who are unrelated to the race , so it 's still a small pool for adventurous travellers			2
@entity285 has competed four times - three of those in @entity201 - and now makes an absolute dream ' tour guide ' of sorts with @entity242 , her second career , with whom she 's worked for the past two years			1
she knows the @entity0 from the inside out			2
on day three of the tour we went off - road in 4x4s , to sample @entity0 like the competitors do			1
on day three of the tour we went off - road in 4x4s , to sample the @entity0 terrain just like the competitors do eventually , we arrived at what resembled an idyllic mirage : a pop - up gourmet restaurant in the middle of the desert champagne on arrival ( and throughout our three - hour stay ) was followed by a three course meal of empanadas , stew and fruit pudding vehicles zoomed past just metres away			1
we could all witness them so closely and cheer on our competitors ; a dream for a keen photographer mini driver @entity39 of @entity41 , right , and co-pilot @entity334 of @entity237 , celebrate atop their car after coming first in the @entity0 we made our way riding for three hours along rocky desert terrain listening to classic rock , before arriving at the checkpoint where all those competing would pass			1
@entity242 tours start from $ 290 + tax ( £ 193 + tax ) per person per day			1
per two to three - day segment prices start from £ 1,114 up to about £ 3,000			1
to find out more about @entity242 head to the @entity0 website			1

when we arrived we were greeted by what resembled an idyllic mirage			0
a pop - up gourmet restaurant in the middle of the desert			2
white tables and chairs beneath a gazebo , kitchen and drinks stations nearby			0
@entity361 on arrival ( and throughout our three - hour stay ) was followed by a three course meal of empanadas , stew and fruit pudding , as bikes zoomed past just 10 metres away			0
buggies , cars and trucks followed , and we could all witness them so closely and cheer on our competitors			0
medical staff , race directors and tv journalists closely followed in choppers , while assistance trucks with food , water , medical and mechanical supplies followed behind			0
it takes supreme effort to transport an entire pop - up garden party to the middle of the @entity50 desert , in a remote , off - road location			1
it is an unusual adventure trip to take , but with the energy and excitement of @entity0 on your doortsep the whole way round , you feel like a racing star from start to epic finish .			1
