by @entity1 reporter published : 03:57 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 08:54 est , 19 may 2012 a private space cargo firm 's historic launch to the @entity4 descended into chaos this morning when the mission was abandoned just one second before lift - off			1
the unmanned @entity9 rocket was set to blast off from @entity10 just before 10am this morning ( gmt ) along with its @entity11 loaded with 1,000lbs of space station provisions			2
but with just seconds before the rocket took to the skies , apparent technical problems left it rooted to the launch pad , with lift - off subsequently abandoned for another three days			1
abort : live footage shows plumes shooting from the side of the @entity9 , as its much anticipated launch was abandoned at the final second delayed : @entity9 's ambitious space trip will now be postponed until tuesday following the technical error this morning the countdown reached all the way to practically zero saturday morning for the @entity9 rocket			1
a @entity31 spokesman said the engine ignition sequence started , but there was an automatic shutdown by on - board computers			2
so instead of blasting off from @entity10 on a delivery mission to the @entity4 , the rocket remained on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust			1
the engine ignition sequence had started up , but there was an automatic shutdown by on - board computers			2
so instead of blasting off on a delivery mission to the space station , the rocket stayed on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust			1
the unfortunate delay caught even @entity31 's most seasoned launch commentator off guard			2
' ... 3 - 2 - 1 , zero , and liftoff , ' announced commentator @entity54 , his voice trailing as the rocket failed to budge			2
' we 've had a cutoff			0
' billionaire rocket designer @entity60 attributed the problem to slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine no. 5			0
' will adjust limits for countdown in a few days , ' he wrote via @entity66			0
tuesday is the earliest that @entity9 can try again to send its cargo - laden @entity11 to the space station			0
the @entity70 - based company - formally known as @entity71 - is targeting every third day for a launch attempt to save fuel in case of rendezvous problems at the space station			1
ready for launch : @entity9 's @entity9 sits on @entity77 at the @entity10 this morning as officials made final preparations for its launch standing tall : @entity9 9 and @entity11 spacecraft , pictured a day before its launch , are in the final stages of preparation for their historic flight @entity9 's eventual launch will see it in the vicinity of the @entity87 within two days , where it will complete practice manoeuvres before the docking takes place the next day			1
amid the chaos of @entity9 's delayed @entity9 launch , there was also disappointment for another secret mission the rocket was due to perform - sending @entity96 from @entity98 ' @entity97 and 307 other people 's ashes into orbit			1
having failed to launch the @entity98 acting legend 's remains into orbit in august 2008 when @entity71 's @entity104 exploded after take - off , this is the second attempt to put a seven gram capsule of his ashes into space			0
but friends and relatives of @entity97 , who died in 2005 aged 85 , who gathered at @entity10 will have to wait until tuesday for the next attempt after @entity9 stalled on lift - off			0
paying a minimum of $ 2,995 to @entity116 , @entity97 and 307 other people 's capsules will be launched from the @entity9 rocket nine minutes into the flight			1
once there doohans capsule will begin a decaying orbit of the @entity124 that will last between 10 to 240 years , ' until it reenters the atmosphere , harmlessly vapourising like a shooting star			0
' only governments have completed such a feat to date , with the @entity9 voyage the first time such a voyage has been completed by a private firm			1
ferrying the @entity11 into space , the mission to the @entity4 will be to deliver 1,000 pounds of non-essential cargo after passing a series of test maneuvers over the course of three days			1
if successful in its first - of - a kind mission , the company behind the venture @entity9 would collect the remaining payments on the $ 396 million contract it has with @entity31 and then enter into a $ 1.6 billion agreement for 11 more flights to the @entity4 the first step in the commercialisation of space to non-governmental firms , @entity9 are hoping one day to deliver up to seven passengers to the @entity4 and other destinations in low - @entity124 orbit			1
the @entity9 rocket suffers from an ' instantaneous launch window ' which means that if they do n't take off at the exact scheduled moment they will have to wait till 3.44 a.m on tuesday for the pad and the @entity4 to line up again			1
this will be the @entity9 's third flight as @entity9 have already sent the projectile into space on two previous occasions			0
however , this mission from a private contractor is not without risk and could very well end in failure , something which @entity9 have been upfront and honest about			0
' demonstration launches are conducted to determine potential issues so that they might be addressed and – by their very nature – carry a significant risk , ' said a statement by the private space firm according to the @entity174			1
' all spaceflight is incredibly complicated , and this flight introduces a series of new challenges – it is only the third flight of the @entity9 rocket , the second of the @entity11 , and the first for a number of all - new components necessary to berth with the @entity4			1
' if any aspect of the mission is not successful , @entity9 will learn from the experience and try again			0
' if all goes well though on the next launch , @entity9 will carry the @entity11 into space and match orbits with the @entity4 launch of @entity192 from the @entity9 launch pad at @entity194 , @entity10 , @entity195 in 2010 the full flight - ready @entity9 ( left and right ) with @entity11 onboard stands on the launch pad at @entity194 , @entity10 , @entity195 there it will go through a series of tests and will pass around one and a half miles below the station to see if its controls are testing properly			1
if that checks out ok , the @entity4 will allow the @entity11 to within 10 feet and pull it in for docking all the while traveling at 17,500 mph			1
staying on board the space station for a week and a half , it will then be re-loaded and sent back to @entity124 where it will land in the @entity209 and be retrieved			0
the launch and subsequent mission will be nerve racking for @entity9 and @entity60 , the @entity213 entrepreneur who founded the space exploration firm			2
an artists view of the space station 's robotic arm reaching out to grab @entity9 's @entity11 which will happen if all goes according to plan after this saturday 's launch ' we have to allow for the fact that this is an extremely complex and tough flight			2
it 's a test flight , not a standard milk run , ' said @entity224 , a @entity225 aerospace consultant and former associate administrator in charge of science at @entity31 according to the @entity229			0
' @entity60 and @entity9 have a tremendous track record , and when @entity104 failed , they stuck with it and made it work			0
' they will have a failure again , because everyone does , but a test flight is a learning experience			0
@entity9 tested the @entity11 capsules ability to parachute safely ( left ) and to splash down in the @entity209 ( right ) ' regardless of how successful the flight is , whether it 's complete or partial , it 's a big step forward			0
this is a sea change			0
' originally , the plan was for @entity9 and their capsule to have docked with the @entity4 by 2009			2
' certainly , we would have hoped to have been further ahead , ' said @entity60 , founder of @entity9 to the @entity229			0
' but i would n’t have expected that with great confidence			0

launch delayed after ' computer problems ' on board commercial rocket
