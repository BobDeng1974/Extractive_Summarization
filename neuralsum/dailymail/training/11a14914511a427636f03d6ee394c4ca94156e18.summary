by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 23:02 est , 24 june 2013 a young cancer patient has drawn up a bucket list of things to do before she dies – including going on the @entity5 and being a bridesmaid			1
@entity7 , 31 , had a promising career in the @entity9 , having progressed to the rank of flight lieutenant			2
however , in april she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and doctors told her there was nothing more they could do for her			1
@entity7 , 31 , was diagnosed with cervical cancer in march last year			1
after chemotherapy and radiotherapy she was given in the all - clear in october			1
however , in april she was told the cancer had returned but ms @entity7 , from @entity22 , says she is refusing to give up , and is determined to live her life to the full in the time she has left			1
she said : ‘ there ’s no point getting angry and asking “ why me ? ” - that ’s not going to get you anywhere			2
’ ms @entity7 has compiled a bucket list , with wishes including eating a meal prepared by @entity32 , driving a super-fast car , and meeting @entity34 for a drink			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t feel any different			0
you ’ve just got to have a positive attitude			0
but having terminal cancer has made me realise how much good there is in the world - people have been so supportive			1
i just want to enjoy my life - enjoy every minute			2
’ the former @entity43 student has been in the @entity9 for five years and is currently based at @entity44 in @entity45			0
she was initially diagnosed with cervical cancer in march last year after an annual smear test			1
ms @entity7 is still having chemotherapy to prolong her life but doctors have said there is nothing more they can do to save her despite various treatments , including laser treatment and a radical trachelectomy to remove part of her cervix , no tumours were found			1
but cancer was found in some of her lymph nodes so she had to endure gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy			2
following a scan last october she was given the all - clear			1
she took a month to recover at home and by @entity65 she was back on the ski slopes to celebrate			0
but another cruel blow was to follow after she began getting pains in her left leg			0
tests were carried out and doctors told ms @entity7 that the cancer had returned			1
two tumours were discovered resting on her major organs , and medics said she could not have any more radiotherapy			0
‘ they said it was back , and there ’s nothing they can do , ’ she said			0
she explained all doctors could offer her was six months palliative chemotherapy			0
she said : ‘ the chemo is not going to cure me			0
it ’s giving me some extra time , and i will only do it as long as it ’s working and can give me a good quality of life to spend with my family			0
’ she has drawn up a list of things to do before she dies which includes having tea at the @entity94 , going in a hot air balloon , taking her family on holiday , and wing walking ms @entity7 , whose sister @entity99 , 30 , is in the army , spent time with her family , parents @entity7 and @entity102 , both 53 , and sister @entity101 , 19 , last week before returning to her @entity9 quarters , where friends are helping to care for her			1
ms @entity7 has urged other young women to make sure they have regular smear tests to reduce their chances of cervical cancer			1
she says she has no doubt that having her smear test last year gave her more time to spend with her family and friends , as she thinks she may have died by now without it			1
she had this advice for other women and girls : ' just take a leaf out of my book			0
' i was diagnosed when i was 30 and had absolutely no symptoms			0
' i would say go and get the test			0
it could save your life			0
even if i just help one person , that would be fantastic			0
' i was fit as a fiddle , endurance running and doing five marathons back - to - back , but cancer is so indiscriminate , it can affect anyone			2
' ms @entity7 has been hindered in carrying out her wishes by the costs of travel insurance for people in her situation			2
she has set up a web page called ' help me : as cancer sucks ! ' where well - wishers have been donating towards the cost of holiday insurance , which can be up to £ 2,000			2
she has a £ 4,000 target and insists she will match every pound donated			0
