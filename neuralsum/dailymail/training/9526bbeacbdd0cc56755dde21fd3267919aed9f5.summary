along a corridor inside @entity2 , @entity0 knew what was coming			1
did @entity5 ’s stunningly graceful opener indicate the summer of discontent was finally over and he is back to his best ? the @entity8 manager is very adept at handling situations like this			1
not too high after a victory , never too low in defeat			0
after @entity5 ’s shenanigans with birthday cakes and seemingly wanting out in pre-season , the manager ’s stance is wise			1
‘ i do n’t want to focus on all the things @entity5 did , ’ was the response from @entity0 , who claims the summer engineering from @entity5 ’s agent @entity20 to get him out of the club was all a misunderstanding			1
@entity5 's form has been under scrutiny but @entity0 has thrown his support behind his player @entity5 ( centre ) broke his goal - scoring duck for the season with a stunning left - footed effort against @entity33 ‘ i support him in the good games and in the bad games			1
i trust what he can do			0
i speak with him every day			0
i know what he thinks and know the way he works			0
‘ he was working in the perfect way			1
he always criticises himself on when he is going to return to his normal performance			2
‘ when i see the players work every day i know about their commitment to the project or not			0
i have a squad i can manage with different names but for the whole squad the commitment is very important			0
in this squad i do n’t have any problem with any player			0
’ although @entity5 ’s goal was brilliant , he was generally poor on saturday			1
the @entity52 gave possession away needlessly throughout — one particular 10 - yard pass flew out of play — and his final ball was often ill - judged			1
city players celebrate with @entity5 after his goal set them on their way to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity33 city boss @entity0 said : ‘ i support [ @entity5 ] in the good games and in the bad games ' this is nothing new for @entity0			1
as he alluded to after this win , the champions had to put up with @entity5 ’s infuriating performances last season , only for them to be forgotten after a classy swish of a boot and the 20 goals it brought			1
‘ if they want to , they ( the critics ) can continue , ’ was @entity5 ’s retort			1
‘ sometimes people forget that i ’m a midfielder and my job is not to score goals all the time			2
’ there is no doubting that @entity5 is one of — if not the — best central midfielder in the @entity81			1
but here he only really played for 15 minutes			0
city need something extra , more consistent			0
‘ we need him back to his best form in terms of passing , even free - kicks , ’ the @entity85 said			0
‘ we are 100 per cent sure we will see the best of @entity5 soon			1
he ’s been ok for us and he knows how important he is for that team			0
‘ if he is on his best form , @entity5 can do whatever he wants because he ’s just different class			2
we are at our best when @entity5 is at his best			2
’ despite his goal , @entity5 was n't at his best for @entity8 against @entity33 the @entity52 international ( right ) looked lethargic when the hosts broke quickly on the counter-attack @entity8 were at their most fluent against @entity101 ’s side when @entity0 opted to replace @entity102 with @entity103 and play three in midfield			1
@entity5 could then breathe and made the difference			2
but while that tactical manoeuvre swung the contest , @entity0 is insistent on persisting with two up front — even in the @entity109			2
@entity110 sussed them out comfortably last week and @entity8 have come under increasing scrutiny in @entity113 for not being able to adapt to different propositions — particularly this time last year when they were humbled by @entity118 ’s @entity117			2
‘ i repeat that for me it is n’t a tactical problem , ’ the @entity119 added			0
‘ we have a lot of statistics on games when we play with two and how many we play with one			2
the most amount of games that we win is with two strikers and four midfielders			0
‘ we can make changes — it is important to do it			0
i ca n’t always speak about a game we played against @entity117 one year ago			0
we played 70 games and did n’t have any problem , except that match because we played very badly with two strikers			0
' @entity5 ( left ) gets tackled by on - loan @entity33 midfielder @entity138 ( right ) during a mixed display			1

@entity0 said he supports @entity5 in good and bad games
@entity8 boss said @entity5 is ' working in the perfect way '
@entity5 scored his first goal of the season for @entity8 against @entity33
though the @entity52 broke his goal duck for the season , his performance was far from *convincing* or anywhere near the midfielder 's lofty *expectations*
