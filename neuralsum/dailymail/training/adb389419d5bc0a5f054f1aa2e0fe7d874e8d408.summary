in @entity21 , @entity20 police say trespassers were caught on the @entity24 train tracks more than 1000 times in seven months last year			1
' people entering the underground rail network place their lives and the lives of others at risk			1
we ’ve seen deaths and horrific injuries as a result of people entering trains , tampering with equipment and trespassing on rail property , ' a @entity20 police spokesperson told @entity42			2
documentary maker @entity43 , 23 , spoke with four men involved in ‘ urban exploring ’ and got four different answers about what it is , how they do it and why they do it			1
what they all shared was an awareness of the dangerous situations they were putting themselves in			0
‘ a lot of people have a different stance of what it actually is , ’ @entity43 told @entity42			2
‘ they argue about what it is and what the structure is			0
’ police are worried about a growing number of young men choosing to invade underground rail networks to take photos documentary maker @entity43 , 23 , spoke with four men involved in ' urban exploring ' and got four different answers about what it is two men who featured in the 30 - minute film , @entity77 : a look into @entity21 's @entity79 , are secretive urban explorers who go by pseudonyms and wear bandannas over their face to avoid being identified			1
they are the type of ' explorers ' police are most concerned about			0
photographer @entity87 runs a @entity90 and @entity91 account where he shares his photos from the underground rail tunnel networks of @entity21 and @entity94			1
‘ the most exhilarating part is when you 're down in the loop and police are coming maybe , and you do n't know what it is , something could happen at any time - that 's the best part about it , ’ he revealed in the documentary			2
in the 30 - minute film , @entity77 : a look into @entity21 's @entity79 , the urban explorers share their photos and memories photographer @entity87 ( left ) and urban explorer @entity109 ( right ) both appear in the documentary with face coverings ‘ when i was up in @entity94 doing the loop my mate slipped over when a train was coming and could have been crushed by the train but he got up , ’ @entity87 added			1
for him urban exploring is about taking photos but also ‘ having fun ’			2
but that does n’t mean he does n’t get scared			0
‘ this one time i was with this girl on a rooftop and she climbed out on this cleaning rope support thing and was hanging there and i took a photo of her there			0
that was the stupidest thing i 've seen anyone do , that was 20 - storeys up , ’ he said			0
fellow ‘ tunnel rat ’ nicknamed @entity109 , 16 , said he got into urban exploring after ' walking around suburbs and getting into sticky situations ’			2
‘ my friends started getting into rooftops and tunnels and they got me into it basically , ’ @entity109 said			0
some of the men are secretive urban explorers who go by pseudonyms and wear bandannas over their face to avoid being identified some of the men have been caught by police before while others are yet to be found @entity145 claim they caught 1000 trespassers on @entity21 's @entity24 in seven months last year the urban explorers use whatever they can get their hands on to gain access to places they deem interesting ' there are lots of tools to get in , coat hangers , lock picks , ’ he explained			1
‘ you have to be stealthy , quick fast in and out , know what you are going in for			0
’ ' if you get caught you 're going to get big fines or imprisonment it 's scary but it also amps you up , ’ @entity109 reasoned			0
the other two men filmmaker @entity43 spoke with are not involved with breaking into train tunnels and prefer to spend their time on construction sites and high - rise buildings			1
@entity168 , nicknamed the @entity10 @entity169 , climbs structures 300 meters above @entity21 ’s @entity171 to document people at their best and worst			2
‘ it 's documenting and showing people things they might never have seen before and giving them a new appreciation of the city , ’ @entity168 said in the film			0
he does n’t believe graffiti should be part of the unusual hobby			0
although he does confess ‘ the most exhilarating part is definitely avoiding police or security guards ’			0
in this photo two men stand on the tracks inside @entity21 's city loop underground train tunnel system @entity87 believes ' the most exhilariting part is when you 're down in the loop and police are coming ' ' if you do n't have any photos or video of it then you do n't have no proof , ' one urban explorer says in the documentary ' it would n't be urban exploring without social media ... if you 're doing something you need to show it off , ' @entity109 said ‘ @entity168 does it from a photojournalist view point … he ’s totally against breaking into the @entity207 tunnels , ’ @entity43 explained			1
when @entity43 asked @entity168 if he does urban exploring for the adrenaline rush , @entity168 denied that was the main kick he got out of it			1
then there ’s @entity213 , who famously fell about 15 metres through the glass ceiling of @entity21 's @entity215 in 2013 while ‘ exploring ’			1
@entity213 reportedly lost his footing while climbing onto a ledge and fell nine metres through the glass roof and another six metres before smashing on the ground			0
‘ i tried to find the most legal way into buildings ... making sure the buildings are unlocked , ’ @entity213 told @entity43			2
@entity168 ( left ) , nicknamed the @entity10 @entity169 , climbs structures 300 meters above @entity21 ’s @entity171 to document people at their best and worst			2
@entity213 ( right ) famously fell about 15 metres through the glass ceiling of @entity21 's @entity215 in 2013 while ' exploring '			1
neither are involved with graffiti or breaking into the city train loops @entity168 gets a kick out of taking photos from perspectives ordinary people do n't get to see the urban explorers all share a head for heights but documentary maker @entity43 is scared of them construction sites and derelict buildings are some of the favourite places for urban explorers to take photos @entity43 was inspired to make the film after he previously documented @entity21 ’s alternative nightclubbing scene and is not involved in urban exploring himself			1
‘ i followed a couple of the guys on @entity91 … i ’m afraid of heights but i got romantic and imagined what it would be like to do it			0
’ asked if the men fear the police , @entity43 said : ‘ two of them have been caught but the two other guys , i do n't know their names , they are wearing masks and cover their identities – they have n’t been caught yet			2
