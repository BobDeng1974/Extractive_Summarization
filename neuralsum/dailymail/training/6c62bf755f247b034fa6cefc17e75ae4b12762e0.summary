by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 09:21 est , 26 september 2012 when @entity1 secured a deal to produce official @entity4 merchandise it was lauded as a major coup for the iconic @entity7 toymaker , which hoped it would provide a much - needed boost to profits			1
but the spectacular success of this summer 's ' @entity11 ' did n't rub off on the manufacturer after bizarre @entity14 mascots wenlock and @entity15 failed to impress a baffled public			1
shares in @entity1 plummeted by more than a third after it was forced to issue a profits warning on the back of poor sales of its @entity14 merchandise , and the firm has now slashed prices by up to 85 per cent in an attempt to shift the unpopular souvenirs			1
panned : sales of @entity14 mascots wenlock , left , and @entity15 , right , have flopped ' disappointing ' : @entity1 shares have struggled over the past year based upon blobs of steel and featuring a single eye each , less - than - cuddly mascots wenlock and @entity15 were designed to symbolise the @entity33 with their @entity35 - inspired friendship bracelets , and featured a nod to the capital in the form of @entity40 ' taxi lights ' on their heads			1
but the public failed to warm to the strange figures and a whole of host of unsold @entity15 and @entity15 branded souvenirs and collectibles are now gathering dust on toyshop shelves			2
@entity1 has knocked £ 96 off the price of a 12 - pack of @entity4 die - cast @entity15 or @entity15 figurines , which are now on sale for £ 23.88 , while many single figurines - originally priced £ 9.99 - are now selling for £ 2.99			1
the toy firm , which is behind @entity56 and @entity57 and also makes model railways , had hoped sales of @entity14 merchandise would see a boom in profits , but admitted that demand for @entity4 products had been disappointing			1
it said that , while early demand for @entity11 - related goods had been encouraging , major retailers had also purchased ' substantial quantities ' of 2012 merchandise from other licensees			2
when the anticipated sales rush failed to materialise , the big retailers introduced deep discounts on the products			2
' the consequence of this for @entity1 was that retailers lost confidence in many categories of @entity4 merchandise , and repeat orders for our products were cancelled , ' the company said			1
@entity1 's shares slumped 37 per cent or 32.37p to 56.13p after it issued the profits warning - its third this year - yesterday			1
shares had risen to 62.13p today			0
the toymaker , which has also suffered from major disruption at one of its largest suppliers in @entity94 , said it is now expecting to only break even in the current financial year			0
last year it made profits of £ 4.5million			0
reduced : @entity1 has slashed prices on souvenirs including this @entity101 chocolate machine which is down from £ 9.99 to £ 3.99 poor sales : ' @entity104 ' model black cabs , originally £ 4.99 , are now £ 2.49 souvenirs : @entity1 has knocked £ 15 off the price of this hand - finished @entity4 showjumping figurine - it is now selling for just £ 4.99 demand : this @entity4 train pack is now out of stock after being reduced by £ 30 to £ 119.99 @entity14 - inspired : @entity1 's @entity113 @entity112 set is still full price at £ 69.99 poor @entity14 sales have led @entity1 to introduce significant reductions on everything from @entity15 and @entity15 figurines to destination @entity119 - now priced £ 2.49			1
but a @entity40 2012 branded train set was still selling on the website for the full price of £ 99.99 , as was the @entity113 @entity112 kit , suggesting the firm is banking on more robust demand for at least some of the merchandise			2
sale : @entity1 has slashed prices on @entity4 themed merchandise after anticipated demand for the products failed to materialise @entity1 said it would be ' constrained significantly ' in the current financial year , but would keep a tight lid on costs and had " redoubled efforts " in product development and innovation in order to turn sales around			1
the firm had put its hopes in @entity145 fever to help revive flagging @entity7 sales , which fell four per cent in the last financial year			0
trading was stronger in @entity148 and @entity149 , which helped wider group profits rise slightly from £ 4.4 million to £ 4.5 million			0
@entity1 was one of 65 licensees that were awarded rights to sell official @entity14 and @entity154 products			2
iconic : the toymaker makes childhood favourites like @entity56 and @entity158 models traditional merchandise : @entity1 is famed for producing model railways wenlock and @entity15 were created by @entity40 - based creative agency @entity161 , which said the mascots had been designed to appeal to children			2
unveiled in the lead up to @entity4 , the duo were given their own individual @entity167 and @entity168 accounts , with @entity169 claiming they would ' come to life in the digital space '			0
but despite their symbolic meaning - and an elaborate ' back story ' penned by children 's author @entity174 - the creations were largely panned by the public			0
the much - criticised mascots attracted further controversy ahead of the @entity11 when it emerged that school were being charged a fee of £ 850 for a visit from actors dressed as @entity15 and @entity15			0
schools could pay the @entity186 of the @entity145 £ 600 for one of the mascots to attend a community event or multi-school sports day , or £ 850 for both			0
critics pointed out that the mascots had been created to ' connect young people with sport ' , but claimed the sizeable fee meant only the richest schools would be able to welcome @entity15 and @entity15			0
at the time @entity186 insisted schools interested in a visit from the mascots were being charged at cost price .			0

@entity4 merchandise failed to provide anticipated profits boost for manufacturer @entity1
poor demand for @entity14 souvenirs like @entity15 and @entity15 figurines led firm to issue profits warning
shares in @entity1 fell by more than a third after the profits warning
