by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:34 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 10:32 est , 23 november 2012 a senior @entity3 mp who earns thousands of pounds advising green energy firms today insisted it was ' reasonable ' for electricity bills to rise by £ 100 - a - year to help pay for more wind farms			1
@entity8 , chairman of the @entity10 energy and climate change committee , leapt to the government 's defence after it emerged deal between @entity16 and @entity17 on @entity19 's power plans would see bills rise			1
electricity bills could rise by £ 75 a year by 2020 to fund a new generation of wind farms and nuclear reactors			1
and by 2030 annual bills will go up by an estimated £ 178 under all the government ’s green and fuel poverty policies			1
electric bills could rise by £ 75 a year to fund the green energy strategy to be unveiled next week a green energy strategy to be unveiled next week will treble the costs levied on bills from £ 2.35billion a year to £ 7.6billion			1
but mr @entity8 insisted it was not a problem			0
' i personally think that a couple of pounds a week - maybe rising to almost £ 3 a week - is a reasonable price for @entity19 to achieve a degree of energy security to reduce its total dependence on fossil fuels and to honour its commitments to cut green house gases , ' he told @entity44			1
however mr @entity8 , who earns almost £ 140,000 from green energy companies , faced criticism from conservative colleagues			1
@entity48 , @entity3 mp for @entity49 , said : ‘ the average constituent in @entity49 is already paying between £ 10 and £ 20 extra for their electricity as a direct consequence of these hidden green surcharges			1
‘ if you have lots of non-executive payments from green energy companies , then perhaps another £ 2 or £ 3 a week does n’t sound a large sum of money from your household budget			1
‘ for those in my constituency who do not have green energy directorships , then it is a lot of money			1
’ earlier energy secretary @entity69 dismissed claims of huge hikes in bills as ' utter rubbish ' and claimed without the measures bills would rise even higher			1
' the impact from supporting clean technologies is only 2 % on peoples ’ bills at the moment			2
by the end of the decade that will grow , and by 2020 will be about 7 % , ' he told @entity44 's today programme			0
' we ’re talking about under £ 100 in 2020			0
in 2012 today we ’re talking just £ 20			0
the figures that are being bandied around are utter rubbish			0
' if you take account of all our policies , which i think when you ’re talking about energy you should look at all aspects of energy policy , and we are making measures on energy efficiency , which will help people save money			0
' victory : @entity99 won a battle of wills with @entity17 energy secretary @entity69 ( right ) who backed a target of cutting power station emissions to a seventh of their current level by 2030 in another development , plans for a drastic cap on carbon emissions have been slapped down by @entity99			1
the chancellor won a battle of wills with mr @entity69 , a @entity17 , who backed a legally - binding target contained in the @entity116 agreement			1
the government ’s climate advisers , the @entity119 , wanted to cut power station emissions to a seventh of their current level by 2030 in order to meet @entity19 ’s climate change commitments			2
it would have meant gas , which provides more than half of @entity19 ’s power , being phased out unless its emissions can be captured and stored using technology that does not even exist			2
mr @entity99 has rejected the call for the cap , which the @entity134 feared would have driven up fuel prices and hit economic growth			1
a @entity140 source said of next week ’s @entity141 : ‘ they have agreed there will be no target in this parliament , a decision on whether there will be one at all will not be taken until 2016			0
’ but it is understood the @entity134 stood firm on green levies on electricity bills rising to no higher than £ 95 a year by 2020 – compared with £ 20 currently			1
the expected £ 178 increase by 2030 would cover all the government ’s green and fuel poverty policies including investment in the power network			1
how to keep the lights on while keeping household electricity bills at a reasonable level has bitterly divided the @entity116 because a fifth of @entity19 ’s power plants are set to close in the next decade			2
mr @entity69 told mps this week that the negotiations on energy policy had been ‘ challenging ’			2
yesterday his spokesman said they had lost the battle for a ‘ decarbonisation ’ target			0
‘ we made no secret of our commitment to the target ’ , she said			0
‘ but we are pleased to have reached an agreement , which will send an important signal to investors and create 250,000 jobs			0
’ mr @entity69 's department is committed to thousands more wind turbines despite opposition the renewable energy industry is facing a crisis , @entity179 leader @entity178 warned yesterday			2
he said firms were becoming confused by ‘ mixed messages ’ from @entity184			0
the @entity116 should instead , he insisted , pledge that all of @entity19 ’s electricity should come from non-carbon sources			0
he said this would create thousands of jobs , adding : ‘ this is absolutely in our economic interest			0
‘ we ’ve got to be absolutely clear about this crisis our green industry is facing			0
and the crisis is caused by the huge uncertainty this government is creating about its intention on climate change and energy			0
’ he claimed the prime minister ’s commitment to the environment had ‘ evaporated ’ since he came to power in 2010			0
@entity207 groups were furious about the failure to sign up to a decarbonisation target for 2030 , saying @entity184 had betrayed promises to lead the ‘ greenest government ever ’			0
@entity212 , executive director of @entity213 , said : ' by failing to agree to any carbon target for the power sector until after the next election , @entity184 has allowed a militant tendency within his own ranks to derail the @entity141			2
' @entity220 's executive director @entity219 added : ' the coalition has caved in to @entity99 's reckless dash for gas and banged the final nail in the coffin of @entity184 's pledge to lead the greenest government ever			2
' mr @entity99 is sceptical about the costs of renewable energy , telling the @entity3 last year : ‘ we are not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business			1
’ last week his father - in - law @entity233 was secretly filmed by @entity213 campaigners saying the chancellor was putting pressure on the prime minister to abandon his environmental commitments			0
mr @entity99 favours a ‘ dash for gas ’ as the cheapest way to power the economy , and will announce a gas generation strategy in the coming weeks which is set to stoke further tensions with the energy secretary and environmental groups			1
the target recommended by the government ’s climate advisers was to force power stations to produce only 50g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 2030			2
gas power currently emits around 350g			0
mr @entity69 said recently that he was ‘ absolutely committed ’ to the target and that : ‘ after 2030 we expect that gas will increasingly be used only as back - up , or fitted with carbon capture and storage technology			1
’ @entity19 is still committed to cutting emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 under the 2008 @entity261			0
but campaigners and businesses doubt this can be achieved without overhauling the energy market to attract more than £ 100billion of investment in green power			1
a generation of nuclear plants will be built and mr @entity69 ’s department is committed to thousands more wind turbines , despite opposition from local communities and more than 100 @entity274 .			2

battle of wills between @entity99 and @entity69 sees cap on carbon emissions dropped
green energy strategy will treble costs from £ 2.35billion to £ 7.6billion
by 2030 , average fuel bill will rise from £ *1,249* to £ *1.427* a year
energy secretary says bills would rise even more without green power
