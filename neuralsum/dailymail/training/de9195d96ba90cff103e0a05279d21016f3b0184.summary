by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 18 march 2012 updated : 11:45 est , 19 march 2012 drivers face new tolls under audacious plans to put @entity5 ’s roads network in the hands of private companies			1
@entity8 will today say he wants to kickstart the economy by allowing firms and investment funds to compete to build , operate and maintain motorways and trunk roads			1
motorists would not pay tolls to use existing roads – but firms could widen them and introduce pay - as - you - go lanes that drivers could use to beat congestion			1
in addition , a proportion of the £ 6billion a year raised through vehicle excise duty would be used by the government to pay contractors , probably based on the number of vehicles using the route			1
ministers hope that as well as getting more private sector investment into the economy , a sale of long - term leases of major roads could raise billions for the @entity53			1
it could become the biggest sell - off since the rail privatisations of the 1990s			1
but motoring groups warned last night that drivers struggling with record fuel prices could ill - afford new charges – and suggested the move could lead to national road pricing , where motorists pay for every mile they drive			2
warning there is simply no longer enough money in public coffers to build more new roads , the prime minister will say in a speech today : ‘ we now need to be more ambitious			1
a taxing issue : toll booths - like this one near @entity71 - could make more of an appearance on @entity5 's roads if private companies are allowed to run them ambitious : @entity8 ( left ) is set to reveal the plans as @entity77 ( right ) seeks to jumpstart the economy and avoid a double dip recession ‘ why is it that other infrastructure – for example water – is funded by private sector capital through privately owned , independently regulated , utilities , but roads in @entity5 call on the public finances for funding ? ’ the radical move comes as chancellor @entity77 seeks to jumpstart the economy and avoid a double dip recession			1
other moves expected in wednesday ’s @entity92 include : ministers are proposing selling long - term leases , probably lasting several decades , to firms or investment funds who want to take over the running of major routes and be guaranteed a regular income over the life of the contract by taking a slice of vehicle excise duty			1
treasury sources said such a scheme would not be full - scale privatisation , since the state would retain ultimate ownership , but would still generate ‘ billions ’			1
full - scale road pricing – where drivers are charged by the mile – has been ruled out			0
in a speech today , mr @entity8 will say @entity5 needs ‘ good roads ’ to boost economic growth			2
but he will admit : ‘ the problem ’s clear : we do n’t have enough capacity in places of key demand			2
there ’s nothing green about a traffic jam – and gridlock holds the economy back			2
‘ so here ’s what we should do			0
yes , move passengers and heavy goods on to rail			0
but also widen pinch points , add lanes to motorways by using the hard shoulder to increase capacity and dual overcrowded a-roads			1
' the massive programme announced during last year ’s growth review made a good start			2
but how do we do more , when , frankly , there is n’t enough money ? ' we need to look at innovative approaches to the funding of our national roads – to increase investment to reduce congestion			1
road tolling is one option – but we are only considering this for new , not existing , capacity			0
’ mr @entity8 will say that the @entity53 and @entity151 will draw up options for ‘ new ownership and financing models for the national roads system ’ and report to @entity156 by the autumn			2
sources made clear all options were on the table			0
but they said the most likely model was that of the water industry , where private firms are overseen by an industry regulator			0
only motorways and major trunk roads , which make up three per cent of the country ’s road network , would go into private hands			1
@entity169 , conservative mp for @entity171 and former chief of staff to @entity77 , told @entity173 ’s today programme , this morning : ‘ we have a chronic need to get more infrastructure in			0
' this is about leveraging in investment – not about selling off roads but about getting investment in roads			0
if we can find new ways of doing that , i think everyone would accept , this is not only needed but valuable			0
' there ’s upgrades to roads going on at the moment that have waited for decades			0
take the @entity192 to @entity193			0
the expected return to the economy is 20 times the cost , but it ’s waited 20 years to happen			0
' given the economic returns on some of these projects which are n’t being built because of the lack of money the government ’s got , then the returns to the economy , and also the millions of people stuck in traffic , are very great from being able to get that extra investment in			2
' ' the benefit is that because private companies doing the work would know they ’ve got an income stream coming in the future from the cars using the roads they manage , then they could go to investors , pension funds and others , and say lend us the money now , we ’ll be able to improve the roads , we ’ll get more people going on them , faster , because of the reducing traffic			1
' and that way we can get the investment now that benefits the economy that ca n’t done because of the constraints on public funds			2
' but @entity231 president @entity230 said : ' i 'm not sure it adds up in that case			0
motorists are already paying 45 billion a year in various motoring taxes , of which , in total , only something like nine billion is spent on the roads			0
so yes , there is money going in			0
the @entity243 could be run more efficiently , but i do n't really think you need a new ownership structure			0
‘ the government has indicated that tolls would only apply on new capacity , but many drivers would suspect new ownership is the thin end of the wedge leading to national road pricing			0
many drivers ca n’t afford current fuel prices , so new charges would be a toll too far			0
’ @entity258 transport spokesman @entity257 said the proposals risked ‘ driving traffic on to local roads , increasing congestion and emissions while yet again setting back efforts to improve safety ’			1
mr @entity77 insisted yesterday he intends to press ahead with a major shake - up of the planning system to speed up new developments , despite criticism from countryside campaigners			1
‘ it is deeply frustrating that the planning rules have held back economic development in @entity5 , ’ the chancellor said .			1
