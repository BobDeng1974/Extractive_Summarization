playing as a lone striker he burst into the box and forced @entity18 goalkeeper @entity50 to make a save smart at his near post			2

@entity45 ’s clever pass found @entity9 , who with a flick of his left boot took the ball away from @entity85 to open up space on the edge of the box and then with his right foot arrowed a low shot into the bottom - left corner			2
the @entity5 fans in the @entity93 then breathed a sigh of relief shortly after when @entity70 misjudged a headed clearance and struck the post of his own goal			2
@entity99 is fouled by @entity100 as he looks to evade the midfielder 's challenge a neat passing move from @entity5 saw them create another gilt edge chance when @entity45 spread the play out to @entity106 who crossed for @entity9 , and he somehow failed to hit the target from close range			1
