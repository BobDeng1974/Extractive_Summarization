retired miner @entity6 , 76 , from @entity8 , has spoken out after discovering the price tag for the drug which could prolong his life			1

as he lives in @entity5 he would have to pay £ 25,000 a year to access it yesterday it was revealed some @entity5 patients are being forced to move to @entity14 to get life - prolonging cancer drugs			1
@entity14 patients are four times more likely to get newer cancer drugs than those living in @entity5 because of special government funding which allows doctors to give drugs not yet given the go - ahead on the @entity33			1
government figures show 15,456 patients in @entity14 were given money last year by the @entity37 – which pays for treatments that have not yet been approved by @entity39 , the @entity33 rationing body			2
this works out at 29 people per 100,000			0
the @entity45 - run @entity43 , whose decision to provide free prescriptions left its budget squeezed , has so far refused to implement a similar scheme			2
this means just 216 patients in @entity5 were given money for new cancer drugs by applying for exceptional @entity33 funding – or seven per 100,000 people			1
mr @entity6 , who is being treated by doctors in an @entity14 hospital in @entity59 , says that he is the victim of a ' postcode lottery ' ministers launched the £ 650million @entity37 three years ago			1
doctors apply on behalf of their patients to get any drug they believe will extend or enhance their lives			2
but the fund was a temporary measure and is due to be wound - up in april			0
the government is getting ready to introduce a system of value - based pricing next year , which is expected to give the green - light to more expensive cancer drugs			1

‘ it ’s an awful lot of money , impossible to afford			0
’ mr @entity6 said the potential cost for the @entity83 drug , also known as @entity83 , could apply each year for the remainder of his life			2
since april 2013 the national @entity37 has approved the use of @entity83			0
but funding only applies to patients living in @entity14			1
‘ if i was living in @entity14 , i ’d be able to get this treatment , ’ he said			2
‘ i need this sorting			0
’ originally diagnosed with cancerous tumours on the liver several years ago , mr @entity6 now needs treatment as cancer has returned in the muscle of his bowel			2

@entity119 does adhere to the national guidelines regarding prescribing			0
‘ since april 2013 , the national @entity37 ( @entity37 ) has approved the use of @entity83 ( @entity83 )			0
‘ however , the cdf only applies to those patients living in @entity14 and not @entity5			1
’ patients can apply to an all - @entity5 panel which will consider if there are grounds for funding a particular medicine or treatment based on their medical history .			2
