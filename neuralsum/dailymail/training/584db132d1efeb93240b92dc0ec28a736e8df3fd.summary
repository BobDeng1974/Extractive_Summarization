by @entity0 published : 05:34 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 07:44 est , 8 november 2012 it was hailed as one of the greatest moments in @entity5 television history but as the @entity7 appeared to parachute into the @entity8 this summer @entity6 thought : ' oh my @entity9 ! what have we sanctioned here ! ' as part of the lavish @entity16 opening ceremony @entity5 's @entity13 was shown jumping from a helicopter with @entity19 actor @entity18 , but ever since there has been mystery surrounding how , exactly , she was persuaded to do it - until now			1
lifting the lid on her first movie role , @entity6 has revealed the audacious stunt had been kept a secret from the @entity7 's own dumbstruck family who watched it unfold on july 27 this year			1
iconic : the @entity7 was shown jumping out of a helicopter and parachuting into the @entity8 in a secret sequence kept from her own family secret : lord @entity6 has revealed in his book that he was one of a few people who knew about the audacious stunt but when it unfolded in front of him he thought ' what have we done ? ! ' prince @entity39 ' roared with laughter ' and @entity41 and @entity42 began yelling ' @entity43 ! ' as she was shown flying across the @entity45 sky before appearing in the royal box , he said			1
in his autobiography , running my life and serialised in @entity49 , @entity6 discusses how director @entity51 , @entity53 ceo @entity52 and even the prime minister had helped make it happen and admitted he was ' speechless and nervous ' about it			2
' when we saw those shoes and peach coloured dress disappearing into the night sky under a billowing parachute , we ( he and @entity52 ) looked at each other , both thinking " oh my @entity9 ! what have we sanctioned here ! " ' , he wrote			2
reaction : the @entity7 's enthralled family , including her laughing son prince @entity39 as she took her seat afterwards during the ceremony @entity42 and prince @entity71 were sat behind @entity6 , who was sat next to prince @entity39			1
' prince @entity39 looked at me and began laughing rather nervously , wondering where on earth this was going			1
and when the film cut to the shot of the @entity79 back , he had exactly the same reaction as everyone else , which was to assume that it was the lady who does the impersonations			2
but the moment she turned around and everyone realised " my @entity9 ! it really is the @entity7 ! " he began roaring with laughter			1
as for his sons , they were beside themselves			2
' as she started her descent , two voices behing me ( @entity42 and @entity71 ) shouted in unison " @entity43 ! " '			1
@entity51 had the original idea and @entity6 knew the @entity7 's deputy private secretary @entity97			1
@entity98 was then informed , who also thought it was a great idea , so brought it up with the @entity7 during their weekly audience at the @entity104			1
' i 'll never forget when @entity51 showed @entity105 ( @entity52 ) and me the finished film			0
even though we had been involved at every stage from storyboard to final script			0
the wit , fun and sheer audacity left us speechless			0
' the recorded sequence opened at @entity104 , where a tuxedo - wearing @entity18 as 007 was presented to the @entity7 by her personal footman as she was writing a letter and training her corgis @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 to roll over			1
the @entity7 and @entity19 drop into the @entity8 the @entity7 greets 007 at @entity104 with the words ' @entity122 , mr @entity19 ' in the film sequence leading up to her parachute ' jump ' olympics opening skit : @entity19 and the @entity7 make their way to the waiting helicopter through the corridors of @entity104 greeting him with an ‘ evening , mr @entity19 ’ , the @entity7 , in a rose - pink dress , was seen striding briskly through the palace with the action hero before climbing into a helicopter emblazoned with the @entity138			1
the two were depicted as soaring over the streets of @entity45 and through @entity141 until they finally reached the @entity142			0
as the film reached its climax , spectators inside the east @entity45 stadium heard an @entity148 helicopter , which finally appeared hovering above			0
as the aircraft steadied in the movie sequence , @entity19 was seen opening the door and appearing to hesitate			0
while he dithered , the figure of the @entity7 pushed past him and dived out into the air followed by 007 – @entity138 parachutes streaming behind them			2
meanwhile , from the real helicopter above the stadium , the same two figures appeared to plunge to earth			0
the @entity79 corgis had a starring role in the film sequence leading up to the helicopter jump smooth operators : @entity19 actor @entity18 and the queen in the helicopter dramatic entrance : the helicopter hovered over the @entity8 , before the ' @entity7 ' jumped out , pulling the rip cord on a @entity138 parachute the helicopter hovered over the @entity8 , before the @entity7 jumped out , pulling the rip cord on a @entity138 parachute and , with the familiar @entity19 theme tune sounding around the stadium , the spotlight shone on the @entity177 to reveal the @entity7 in exactly the same dress she wore in the film			2
accompanied by the @entity180 , she entered to rapturous applause with @entity182 , president of the @entity183			0
the @entity138 was then carried into the stadium and raised by representatives of the @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			0
director @entity51 said : ‘ @entity7 made herself more accessible than ever before			2
’ @entity188 , @entity189 director of @entity190 who produced the sequence , filmed in march , said it had required ‘ a huge amount of planning and resources ’			0
he said he hoped the result was a film ‘ full of warmth , joy , affection , wit , surprise and excitement and sunshine ’			0
organisers said that having to secure permission to fly along the @entity207 through @entity141 – which had never been done before – was a challenge in itself			0
the two parachutists who actually leapt from the helicopter last night were @entity211 , a professional base jumper , and @entity213 , a former officer in the @entity214			0
as the parachutist touched down , the @entity7 and the @entity180 made their way into the stadium she joined @entity183 president @entity182 , other members of the royal family and senior politicians in the @entity177 the @entity7 's expression was businesslike as she took her place in the @entity177 - all part of the act the queen is greeted by @entity227 ( right ) and @entity98 after her spectacular entrance into the @entity8			1

the @entity7 had kept the stunt a secret from her family while those few in the know , including @entity6 , watched their reactions nervously
prince @entity39 ' began roaring with laughter . as for his sons , they were beside themselves , ' he says
@entity71 and @entity42 were shouting ' go @entity242 ! '
@entity98 asked if she was willing to do the *mini-movie* during their weekly meeting at the @entity104
