by @entity0 @entity1 , who suffered horrific burns , when she fell on to a gas fire at her home in @entity5 a toddler died when she fell into a gas fire after the fireguard fitted in her home ' was n't suitable ' , an inquest heard			1
@entity1 was just 23 months old when she died from multiple organ failure after suffering 60 per cent burns when she climbed on to the guard from a footstool and lost her balance at her home in @entity5 , @entity16			1
the infant had been left unattended for a few seconds when the accident happened in december 2011 and the hearing heard how her clothes ignited as her parents desperately tried to douse the flames			0
@entity1 was then rushed to hospital in @entity5 before being transferred to a specialist burns unit at @entity25 , where she later died			1
at an inquest , @entity27 's mother @entity26 said it was obvious the fireguard , provided by a council - run home safety scheme , did n't fit the large raised fireplace in their living room			1
she said : ' a man came to fit the fireguard about a year before the accident			2
it was obvious that it was n't suitable			2
' we had been told by the council we were eligible for free home safety measures			1
two people came round to inspect our home and sent a man round to fit the fireguard , along with a safety gate , in our home			1
' he said the fireplace was n't completely covered , but that it would do the job			1
i do n't remember being given any documents with instructions on how to use it			2
' he just showed me how to hook it to the wall and remove it			0
' ms @entity26 also recalled how she had popped out of the room at the time of the incident and then ran back in after she heard her daughter screaming			1
the fireguard was made by the @entity65 of @entity66 ( @entity67 ) and fitted by firm @entity68 as part of a family safety measures scheme with the local safeguarding children 's board			1
@entity73 , who fitted the safety device in the house , told the inquest he could n't recall fitting it in the main living room			1
he said : ' i vaguely recall suggesting the guard should go in the upstairs bedroom as the fire in the living room was raised off the ground			1
' i remember having some sort of disagreement with the father over where the guard should go			2
@entity27 was taken to hospital in @entity5 and was then transferred to a specialist burns unit at the @entity25 , where she later died ' if i thought something was unsafe i would always ring my manager , the man who trained me or the office			1
i would never be persuaded by a persistent customer			0
' he added : ' i always leave an instruction manual with the client and go through it with them if needs be			0
this explains that fireguards should n't be climbed on and should be used with parental supervision			0
' the inquest also heard from @entity105 officer @entity104 , who said : ' there are are some @entity105 diagrams which show fireguards which may fit over larger fires such as this one			1
this particular guard was the only one available through the @entity113 scheme			0
' it was this fireguard or no fireguard at all			0
' if the manner in which it is fitted was found to be in breach , the remedy arising from that could be that we take over criminal prosecution with the distributor for causing the fireguard to be unsafe			0
' that was n't done in this case			0
' summing up assistant coroner @entity126 gave an accidental ruling			1
he said : ' these events are events from which no one ever truly recovers			0
it 's only human to cast around to think what could have been done differently			0
' there is an irony in the likelihood with how @entity1 came to contact with the fire by the fireguard that was there to protect her			2
the fireplace where the incident happened with a fireguard , similar to the one which was fitted ' @entity144 hypotheses have been brought forward			2
it 's unlikely that @entity146 fell directly into the fire , if so she would not have got out and onto the other side of the fireguard			0
' it 's also unlikely she climbed over the guard , it was 60cm and she was only a metre tall			2
' he said @entity1 's death , on the balance of probabilities , was more to do with the placing of the footstool she used to climb onto the fireguard			1
' my conclusion is that wherever [ the fireguard ] was fitted , the crucial thing was not its presence but the presence next to it of the adjacent piece of furniture , ' the assistant coroner added			2
' i find it impossible to resolve disputes about whether the fireguard was fitted in the lounge or elsewhere			0
both have been given support in the evidence given by people all trying to do their best to prevent any tragedy			0
' it is every parent 's nightmare to turn away for a few seconds and to have a disaster occur			0
this was a tragic accident and it is impossible to think of words to say			0
' speaking after the inquest , @entity1 's father @entity189 said : ' we have since had two more children and this has given us solace and helped us move on a bit			1
we 've put everything behind us now			0
