by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 30 september 2013 as @entity2 went out with a bang last night , one superfan has devised a unique way of remembering the show 's best bits through a series of fascinating pictures			2
student @entity9 , 21 , who is from the town the hit series is set in , has visited many of the places that feature in the programme and taken a real - time snap shot of some of the iconic scenes			1
so as viewers mourn the end of the hit show , @entity9 's project provides a glimpse into the world of the successful drama			1
pizza the action : a scene where @entity27 , played by @entity28 , throws his dinner on his garage roof you 've got to hand it to the photographer : the rv where @entity35 and @entity36 cook their crystal meth pulled into @entity40 bus station @entity9 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , said : ‘ what you see in this set of pictures is a screen shot from @entity2 placed in the environment it was filmed in			1
‘ i wanted to capture the reality of the show by taking memorable or iconic scenes and places throughout seasons one to five			1
i wanted to breathe more life into the show by presenting the actual setting of the scenes			1
the project features familiar sights from the @entity60 drama , including the pizza on the roof scene and the lawyer 's office			0
good call : the exact spot where @entity67 talks on the phone near a footbridge hungry for drama : @entity67 strolling outside fast - food joint @entity72 's legal eagle : the real - life office of @entity27 's lawyer , @entity76 @entity9 was able to recreate the scenes by ' playing with depth ' with a camera , which meant painstakingly trying to find the right position to shoot in			1
‘ i would match up something within the picture and measure how far or how close it needed to be from the camera , ’ the media studies undergraduate said			0
‘ from there , i chose the correct angle in order to create the illusion of a unified shot			0
driven to make money : the car wash @entity93 and @entity27 bought with the proceeds of their meth business blended in : @entity97 , who is played by actor @entity98 ' fans are excited to see the reality of their beloved show , while others are interested in how i was able to create these photos			2
’ she has been hooked on the show since the beginning and even thanked producers for choosing her home town as its set			2
she continued : ‘ i have been a huge fan of @entity2 since the beginning			0
i have watched @entity67 transform into an international drug lord named @entity113			0
as the series comes to an end , i am eager to see how @entity35 gets himself out of these terrible situations			0
‘ personally , i would like to thank everyone that has worked with @entity2			0
without them choosing our small town in @entity41 , my photos would 've never existed			1
‘ the show has put our town on the map in regards to popularity			2
they have helped with attracting more entertainment business to the city and for that i would like to thank them			0
