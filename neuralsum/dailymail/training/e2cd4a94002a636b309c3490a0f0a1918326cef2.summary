by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 18:06 est , 4 january 2014 @entity2 lives in a converted barn set amid eight - and - a - half acres of gently undulating limestone hills which straddle the ancient border of @entity6 and @entity7			1
when she put her home on the market , more than 250 families asked her estate agent for details			1
ultimately , none would come to view			1
mrs @entity2 – 63 , and widowed in 2011 – has had to take @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , off the market			1
today her five - bedroomed property is as much a prison as a home because it stands on the potential path of a new line of high - voltage electricity pylons servicing a future cluster of wind farms in @entity27			1
even at a knockdown price , she can not sell			1
soon but a memory : this @entity31 view is set to be no more when several 400,000 - volt pylons is set up across the landscape she is entitled to compensation from neither @entity36 , the company behind the pylon line , or the government , that has pledged to generate 15 per cent of the @entity41 ’s power from renewable sources by 2020			1
it is a small human tragedy being played out against the backdrop of one of the major issues of the @entity47 – keeping @entity41 ’s lights on			1
and it is being replicated across the country as the demand for a cleaner , greener future threatens to turn the @entity41 into what one campaigner has dubbed ‘ pylon island ’			1
an ugly army of 400,000 - volt pylons is set to march across some of @entity41 ’s most beautiful landscapes			1
they are necessary to plug energy from wind turbines , new nuclear power stations and even the @entity64 into the @entity36			1
lines in @entity66 , the @entity69 - @entity68 border and @entity27 are ready to be put forward for planning consent , while one in @entity72 is not far behind			2
lines in @entity74 and on the @entity75 are still to have their exact routes settled			2
the most advanced is the @entity78 line already under construction			2
the least , needed for the 2020s , is to bring wind energy ashore from turbines off the @entity84 coast			2
but the giant pylons – some behemoths up to 213ft tall – will trap homeowners in blighted or unsellable homes , damage tourism - based businesses and spoil historic views			1
areas under threat include the @entity94 of @entity78 , the southern gateway to the @entity31 , the @entity96 , and the @entity84 countryside which inspired old masters constable and @entity99			1
this new front in the battle to keep @entity41 at full power could have political repercussions in the run up to the 2015 general election			1
local communities , led by a cross-party band of mps including @entity110 dr @entity109 and @entity112 @entity111 , accuse the @entity113 of treating them as collateral damage in the race for renewables and a low - carbon future			2
last week , sir @entity118 , president of the @entity119 – which has the @entity120 as patron – stepped up the political pressure with an attack on all three parties			2
he accused the @entity113 and the @entity125 of embracing energy policies which permit wind and solar farms to ‘ industrialise the countryside they set out to preserve ’			2
the group forecasts that more than 200 miles of new pylons could blight @entity6 and @entity7 in the next decade			1
added to that total is a project which dwarfs them all : in @entity78 , a 137 - mile power line is already under construction between @entity138 , ten miles west of @entity139 , and @entity140 near @entity141 to the south			1
among those who spoke of its devastating consequences of the @entity147 project was former @entity78 rugby international @entity148 , who is married to tv presenter @entity149			2
the @entity148 family farms in the shadow of the world famous monument to @entity155 hero @entity154 at @entity156 near @entity157 , past which the line crosses			2
anti pylon : former rugby player @entity148 and tv presenter wife @entity160 ‘ they should be proud of this land and the @entity78 heritage it represents – instead they are tearing it up , ’ says clan matriarch @entity161 , 81			2
that was a battle lost in the war on super-pylons but others , notably in mid @entity7 , @entity66 and @entity68 , are still being fought			2
@entity66 mp dr @entity109 is in the vanguard demanding a coherent response from @entity36 and the government			2
he said : ‘ we need to accept that the cost of pylons is measured not just in money but in the loss of our countryside			1
' @entity36 is so obsessed with the short term and pleasing its shareholders that it is clinging to old technologies instead of investing in new ones which could remove the scar of pylons for the next generation			1
‘ and they have a human cost			2
they blight the homes of those in their way and destroy the one thing country dwellers cherish more than any other – the beauty of the natural landscape			2
‘ no one wants @entity41 ’s lights to go out , we all need electricity , but those unaffected by this issue close their eyes to it			1
pylons were invented three quarters of a century ago : are they really still the best we can do ? ’ according to @entity36 , the answer is yes			1
it favours pylons because of the significant saving compared to running power lines underground or sinking them offshore			1
a 2012 report commissioned by @entity36 and the @entity213 ( @entity213 ) , which was endorsed by the @entity214 , concludes that a pylon line costs between £ 2.2 million and £ 4.2million per kilometre , whereas the cheapest undergrounding option costs between £ 10.2 million and £ 24.1 million for the same stretch			0
the company highlights its environmental work to mitigate the effects of pylons – using topography and woodland to mask them – and its planned undergrounding in sensitive areas such as @entity84 ’s @entity227			1
it is pledging to use some new ‘ t ’ shaped pylons , which are 50ft shorter than the traditional ‘ a ’ frame , and points out a line of super-pylons can give a net reduction in the number of pylons in an area such as @entity66 , where 90 small 132 - kilovolt pylons will be dismantled to make way for their bigger 400kv cousins			1
a @entity36 spokesman said : ‘ these new connections are essential to keep the lights on and maintain our way of life			0
we plan routes away from homes and , where appropriate , use underground cables or the innovative new t - pylon design			0
we understand the local impact and we want to work with communities to reduce this , while also managing the cost paid by everyone through their energy bills			0
ultimately it is the government who decide whether we have got the balance right through the planning process			0
’ but unlike victims of other major national infrastructure projects , such as the new high speed rail link @entity263 , families and businesses in the path of these pylons receive no compensation unless a pylon is actually on their land			1
there is no payout for proximity , despite the visual blight and impact on house prices , estimated at 30 to 40 per cent by campaigners			0
mother - of - three @entity279 lives in a @entity281 farmhouse with holiday lets in a rural area threatened by a proposed pylon line near @entity285 in @entity74			0
it ’s not a @entity36 scheme but a private company ’s connection from a proposed gas - fired power station			0
@entity292 : the expansion of the ' pylon army ' is necessary to plug energy from wind turbines , new nuclear power stations and even the @entity64 into the @entity36 the @entity213 told her bluntly : ‘ @entity263 will have different impacts to transmission network infrastructure and mitigation measures are different			0
’ the high - speed rail link , it confirms , ‘ does not set a precedent ’			0
yet farmer and butcher @entity305 , 53 , who lives with wife @entity307 and their two children in @entity310 in @entity17 – where pylons from @entity36 ’s @entity27 connection could pass as close as 165ft away – says : ‘ this has already ruined our life and potentially our livelihood			1
’ the scheme has ‘ scuppered ’ a business plan for diversification into free - range sausages and home - cured bacon , and to develop disused buildings on the farm			0
‘ we invested heavily and got planning permission for four dwellings in redundant barns , ’ he said			0
‘ we developed one and moved into it ourselves			0
the sale of the old farmhouse was meant to be the last piece of the jigsaw			0
‘ it was on the market for £ 445,000 and was getting real interest but as soon as the path of the pylons was announced all the viewings stopped			1
the estate agent advised us to take it off the market as it is unsellable			0
‘ we have borrowed heavily and selling the farmhouse was an essential part of our plan			0
financially , this could finish us – the pylons have made our assets worthless			1
’ in @entity7 ’ @entity349 in @entity350 , @entity351 , 67 , and his wife @entity352 , 65 , live in a @entity354 * listed 1612 house restored under the eye of a @entity357 specialist over seven years			1
they are also victims of the so - called wind - rush , which they estimate has knocked at least 25 per cent off the value of their home			0
their house could have a pylon just 200ft away with the couple having to go under power lines to reach their front door			0
mr @entity351 said : ‘ we wanted this house to be as it was 400 years ago			1
how can having a pylon so close to a heritage site be justifiable ? ’ in @entity66 , @entity371 , 56 , tells a similar story			0
he lives at @entity373 , @entity374 , where he expects a pylon about 260ft from his home			0
‘ my wife and i were planning to move soon as our children are growing up			0
but houses nearby have stopped selling			0
so we are trapped in this house which will , by 2019 , look out on to a huge pylon with 100ft of cables buzzing over us			0
we also have a little holiday cottage on our land but people come for unspoilt views , not to stare out on to a pylon			0
’ as @entity109 says : ‘ the majority of the electricity transmitted along super-pylons is destined for urban centres , not the rural communities which suffer the greatest impact			0
‘ everyone should share the costs over the long term – a few pennies per quarter – to put new power cables underground			0
’ for now , however , it is the minority who must pay the price			0
‘ it is a betrayal of ordinary people and unspoiled countryside , ’ says @entity279			0
‘ we ’re supposed to be a green and pleasant land – soon we ’ll be green and pyloned			0
’ additional reporting : @entity408 - @entity407			0

several areas in @entity41 will see electric pylons *installed*
areas under threat include the @entity94 and the @entity31
more than 200 miles of pylons may be built in the @entity41 in ten years
