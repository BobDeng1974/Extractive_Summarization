by @entity0 teenagers in hoodies are stereotypically portrayed as uncommunicative			0
but this could be about to change after a team of graduate students created a hooded sweatshirt that lets the wearer send subtle and covert messages			1
different pre-programmed texts can be sent using a number of gestures , so wearers can tell a friend they 're free to chat or they 're missing them , merely by touching their sleeve			2
by touching the sides of her hood , designer @entity25 ( pictured ) can send a text to her mother the prototype hoodie is designed to respond to three gestures in order to send pre-programmed messages			1
the smart sweatshirt was created by students at @entity37 ’s @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
the prototype hoodie has a @entity41 radio and sensors sewn inside it , allowing the piece of clothing to respond to different gestures , @entity38 reported			2
in a demonstration video , the wearer touches the hood and rolls up a sleeve to send messages to a pre-programmed contact			1
@entity53 and @entity54 learned how to build a simple mobile phone using an @entity57 board - a microcontroller			0
it also features an @entity41 shield , which connects the @entity57 to the internet using the @entity63 wireless network			0
they said they wanted to put ‘ the technology behind a cell phone into something truly wearable and every day , ’ and so created the ‘ smart hoodie ’			1
smart inside : the prototype hoodie has a gsm radio and sensors sewn inside it ( pictured ) , allowing the piece of clothing to respond to different gestures a textile designer in @entity76 has taken the first steps to creating clothing that can change colour like a chameleon			1
@entity82 's experimental fabric can change colour in seconds using a number of electronic devices			0
she created the interactive fabric using computer programming , engineering and electronic devices			0
the fabric consists of an ‘ arduino with @entity93 power supply and 20 custom pcbs [ printed circuit boards ] driving and controlling four industrial @entity97 power supplies			0
' these heat two handmade woven pockets fitted with nichrome wires , and screen - printed with thermochromatic dying , which reveal the pre-programmed patterns			2
two slow moving textile ‘ displays ’ show the content			0
they react to environmental changes such as heat and pressure by changing colour and pattern			0
@entity82 's work could be one of the first steps in creating clothes and military uniforms that enable wearers to blend into changing backgrounds			0
@entity25 wrote in a blog post that the first switch was concealed in the left sleeve of the hoodie so she could secretly send messages to her @entity126 account			1
‘ after that we tested switches with the hoodie and other sleeve			0
gestures that used to require your fingers on a tiny piece of glass now are translated into everyday movement ; buttons no more , ’ she said			0
the duo then programmed the hoodie to send set text messages to @entity25 ’s mother , notifying her of her daughter ’s activities at university			2
‘ if i rolled up my left sleeve it tells her i am in class and ca n’t talk , if i put my hoodie on it tells her that i miss her , and if i push the right sleeve it lets her know i am free and can chat online , ’ she said			0
the graduates believe their innovation could be the first step in producing a hoodie that can be used as a safety device , so that someone walking along in a bad area at night , for example , could subtly send a message about their whereabouts without attracting any unwanted attention			1
‘ @entity166 of this hoodie can be a safety device for individuals traveling alone , children or others that need to communicate discreetly , ’ @entity25 said			1
currently , the wearers of the hoodie need a certain amount of tech know - how to pre-programme messages , but in the future there could be an easy web interface to let users write messages and numbers so they could easily communicate using the clothing			1
in a demonstration video , @entity25 touches the hood and sleeves of the garment , and rolls up a sleeve to send messages to her mother			2
for example , rolling up the sleeve sends a message ( pictured ) informing her mother she is in class and unable to talk the graduates believe that their innovation could be the first step in producing a hoodie that can be used as a safety device , so that someone walking along in a bad area at night for example , could subtly send a message about their whereabouts			1
here , @entity25 touches the hoodie 's sleeve to send a message			2

graduate students from @entity37 created the smart hoodie
wearers can touch the hood and sleeves to send secret messages
hoodie is fitted with sensors that send pre-programmed messages
clothing can be used secretly to communicate and could one day be made into a safety device for children , or even the *police*
