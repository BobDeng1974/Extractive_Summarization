a nasty polar vortex that wreaked havoc on the east coast in january is making a shock return next week - though do n't pull out your puffer coat just yet			0
unseasonably chilly air is headed for parts of the northern and northeastern @entity8 where residents have been sweltering in 90 degree weather this week - as one would expect in july			1
thankfully , families wo n't be plunged into the despair they endured during january 's brutally cold weather pattern			1
but the looming conditions bear some resemblance , so much so that meteorologists are dubbing this the polar vortex sequel			1
polar vortex : a cold front set to hit the @entity21 next week is not another polar vortex , just unseasonably chilly weather cooling off : six - year - old @entity24 runs through the water at the splash pad at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 on thursday			1
but the weather is set to turn chillier soon according to the @entity35 , a deep pool of cool air from @entity33 and @entity34 will plunge into the @entity36 early next week			2
from there it 'll move towards the east coast			0
because we 're in july - the peak of summer - rather than bitter mid-winter , temperatures are expected to drop 10 - 30 degrees below average , so the polar vortex 's ' lite ' wo n't have quite the same effect			2
but it certainly will be chilly than normal , requiring hoodies and jeans in parts of the @entity36 and @entity21 where the coolest air is expected and highs are forecast to be in the 60s and 70s tops - a sharp difference from the 80s and 90s of recent weeks			1
on wednesday morning , the lows may drop into the 40s over a large part of the central @entity8 , which is extremely unusual in july			0
according to the @entity35 , the coolest temps will likely miss the east coast , but highs are still forecast to be 10 degrees below normal , struggling to reach 80 in @entity59 next tuesday and wednesday with widespread lows in the 50s			1
january chill : the winter @entity64 brought freezing temperatures and mountains of snow to much of the @entity21 and @entity68 the relatively cooler air may also be felt in @entity70 , according to @entity71			2
the brief weather pattern could even break records around the @entity74 and @entity36			2
@entity76 meteorologist @entity75 told the @entity35 that @entity78 's typhoon @entity77 is playing a role in how the polar vortex is coming together			0
the large and powerful nature of this storm has set in motion a chain - reaction set of events that will dramatically alter the path of the jet stream and affect weather patterns across the entire @entity90 next week , ' he said			0
' @entity77 will cause an acceleration of the @entity93 jet stream , causing a large amount of warm , moist tropical air to push over the @entity93			0
this will amplify a trough low pressure over @entity33 , causing a ripple effect in the jet stream over western @entity100 , where a strong ridge of high pressure will develop , and over the @entity103 @entity8 , where a strong trough of low pressure will form			0
