by @entity0 published : 03:45 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 22 may 2013 a terrified basejumper hurtles towards the ground after his parachute failed to open when he jumped off a 1,000ft cliff			1
but amazingly @entity6 , 25 , escaped with only minor cuts and bruises despite crashing into rocks on his way down before landing on the sand			1
the daredevil said he thought he was going to die when his parachute got twisted on his way down			1
he has carried out more than 180 basejumps at locations around the world and all of them had previously been successful			2
at the end of the video the daredevil can be seen lying on the ground appearing shocked but conscious and not seriously hurt			0
his parachute is only partially opened			2
he had minor injuries to his ankles and knees as well as a bloodied nose			2
over he goes : @entity6 had completed 180 base jumps successfully , as well as 700 sky dives , but this time the parachute failed to open properly and became twisted @entity6 was travelling the world and taking part in extreme sports but flew back to @entity48 after this jump went wrong			1
he was in hospital for around seven hours for tests but was swiftly discharged			0
@entity6 , who took up the sport after completing over 700 sky dives , recalled the horrifying moment he thought he was going to die			2
he said : ' i prepared for the jump , everything felt really good			0
then i performed a " track " , which means you are flying in a forwards direction			0
down : just a moment later @entity6 crashed into the cliff as he tumbled down over @entity15 , in @entity16 ' everything was going fine and then i pulled the parachute			1
the problem was the deployment was really slow , it comes down to simple bad luck , nothing else , the conditions were fine , the parachute twisted and when it inflated it was facing backwards			1
' due to the twists i could n’t control it , i did the best i could with the situation and tried to avoid the cliff but i did n't have the time or the space to avoid the impact			0
' when i impacted the first time i started spinning which made the situation worse , the parachute twisted even more before going into a dive and then spiralled towards the ground while i was smashing against the cliff			1
' i was trying to think about what to do , but all i could think about was trying to stay alive , i knew the final impact was coming soon and i knew if i hit the floor at the speed i was travelling , i was in a whole lot of trouble			2
' i managed to hang off one side of the canopy and get away from the cliff but could n’t control it still , i did n’t know if i was going to hit the floor or go into the lake			0
' i thought both of my legs were broken so i knew i could n’t go into the lake , plus , i ca n’t swim which made things even worse			0
' he added : ' all i was shouting was " give me something " it was like i was in a gladiator arena faced against ten guys and i was given just a spoon to fight with , i felt i was desperately fighting to stay alive			2
' i was trying everything i could to get some kind of control , then i looked down and saw around ten spikes which i believe were used to hang up wet suits			0
drop : what @entity6 could see as he went over the edge - but the ground quickly rushed towards him crash : @entity6 hits the rocks several times on his way down to the bottom as the parachute failed to open properly			1
amazingly , he suffered only minor injuries ground approaching : @entity117 said at this point he was convinced he was going to die - but remarkably he suffered only slight injuries helmet cam : @entity6 , pictured before he went over the edge , used this camera to record footage of te terrifying jump crash ! @entity6 hits the ground but is conscious and talking			1
he was subsequently rushed to hospital for checks ' at that point i thought i was going to die so the last thing i shouted was " i ’m going in " which means i ’m dead			0
i was trying to tell the guys at the top of the cliff what was happening to me			0
' the spikes were around a foot long and there was ten of them , the one right in the middle brushed my face and went between my helmet and my face and ripped my helmet off , i think it cushioned my fall slightly			0
' when i hit the floor i was so shocked i was alive , i was thinking , i have seen this stuff on videos but now it is happening to me , i was in total shock that i was alive , that was when the pain set in			1
' dazed : his parachute caught on a row of spikes , @entity6 lies on the floor after his jump went wrong			1
he was injured , but not seriously @entity157 face : the cliff that @entity6 jumped from above @entity15 - and ended up wounded on the ground precaution : @entity6 is strapped up and wrapped in a blanket as he is put on a stretcher hospital : @entity6 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , is put in the back of the ambulance in @entity16			1
he was detained for seven hours while checks were carried out , but was subsequently discharged treatment : although he was put in a neck brace , @entity6 had suffered only minor cuts and bruises in the fall @entity6 suffered the fall on april 23 as he travelled the world taking part in extreme sports			1
he used to work in sales and marketing but saved up enough money to travel and indulge his adrenaline - pumping hobbies.despite his fall , he insists he will still continue to base jump			0
he said : ' i feel massively lucky to survive , i have never heard of this sort of thing happening before and especially no one surviving from it			0
' i am still going to base jump but it has made me more aware of the risks , i would n’t want this happening to me again and would n’t wish it one anyone else			0
' some jumps i may not do , i may avoid the more technical ones but i will carry on jumping , my parents are desperate for me to stop , but i fully accept the dangers of this sport and do n’t expect any sympathy			0
' lucky escape : @entity6 grins the day after his fall			2
he flew back home following the incident recovery : matthew back at his home in @entity23 , @entity24 , where he is resting following his basejump which went wrong in @entity16			1
