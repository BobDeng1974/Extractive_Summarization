the vitamin - like supplement coenzyme @entity1 could halve death rates among people with heart failure and reduce hospital admissions supplements of a popular energy - booster could halve death rates among people with heart failure , claim scientists			1
the vitamin - like supplement coenzyme q10 also reduces hospital admissions , says a major new study			2
it is the first drug shown to save the lives of heart failure patients in more than a decade - and it is available over the counter in health food shops			1
@entity1 - which can be taken with statins - should now be added to conventional treatment for such patients , according to professor @entity23 , who led the study			1
professor @entity23 said : ‘ @entity1 is the first medication to improve survival in chronic heart failure since @entity30 inhibitors and beta blockers more than a decade ago and should be added to standard heart failure therapy			1
‘ other heart failure medications block rather than enhance cellular processes and may have side effects			2
' supplementation with @entity1 , which is a natural and safe substance , corrects a deficiency in the body and blocks the vicious metabolic cycle in chronic heart failure			1
’ more than 900,000 @entity42 live with heart failure , which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body			0
around 100,000 a year are thought to die from it			0
heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue , breathlessness , increased heart rate and swollen ankles , and it can lead to serious complications			0
@entity1 is a substance similar to a vitamin which is made by the body and found in every cell , where it is used to produce energy			0
however , @entity1 levels are decreased in the heart muscle of patients with heart failure , who are often taking statin drugs that in turn deplete the body ’s supplies still further			1
previous research has shown @entity1 improves symptoms , functional capacity and quality of life in patients with heart failure with no side effects			1
but until now , no trials have been big enough to prove that supplements increase survival			0
the latest study from researchers at the @entity83 , @entity80 randomly allocated 420 patients with severe heart failure from a number of countries to @entity1 or placebo - a dummy drug - and followed them for 2 years			1
heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue , breathlessness , increased heart rate and swollen ankles @entity1 halved the risk of patients suffering death or serious deterioration of symptoms , including hospitalisation			1
altogether 29 ( 14 per cent ) patients in the @entity100 had such an event compared with 55 ( 25 per cent ) patients in the placebo group			0
@entity1 also halved the risk of dying from all causes , which occurred in 18 ( 9 per cent ) patients in the @entity100 compared to 36 ( 17 per cent ) patients in the placebo group			0
the substance is essential to survival and as well as being important for energy production in cells , it also functions as an antioxidant , which protects the body from damage caused by harmful molecules			0
@entity1 is naturally present in small amounts in a wide variety of foods , with higher levels in organ meats such as heart , liver , and kidney , as well as beef , soy oil , sardines , mackerel , and peanuts , but levels obtained through diet are insufficient to impact on heart failure			2
@entity1 is available over the counter as a food supplement and many doctors advise patients on statins to take it as well in order to offset the cell energy - depletion caused by statins			2
but professor @entity23 cautioned : ‘ food supplements can influence the effect of other medications including anticoagulants and patients should seek advice from their doctor before taking them			0
’ he added : ‘ we have no controlled trials demonstrating that statin therapy plus @entity1 improves mortality more than statins alone			0
’ nevertheless , he supported the use of @entity1 by heart patients on statins because of their effect on supplies of the naturally - occurring nutrient .			2

@entity1 is first drug shown to reduce heart failure deaths in a decade
known as @entity1 , it is a vitamin - like supplement sold in health food shops
@entity1 levels are decreased in the heart muscle of patients with heart failure
the pill - which is ' a natural and safe substance ' - can be taken with statins and ' should now be added to conventional treatment , say *experts*
