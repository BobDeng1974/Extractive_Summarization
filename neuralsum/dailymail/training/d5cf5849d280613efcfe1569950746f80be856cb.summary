and to think this was not deemed attractive enough for television			0
what more do they want ? the @entity4 conquerors of @entity5 versus another terrified top - flight opponent , old boys rejected by @entity8 with a score to settle , a deafening capacity crowd and a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses up at			1
and boy , did it deliver — a beautifully ugly contest , blood , studs and thunder from the off			0
goalscorer @entity21 is mobbed by his team - mates @entity23 and @entity24 after scoring @entity26 's second goal at @entity27 @entity21 gets beyond @entity8 defender @entity28 to score against his former club and double @entity26 's advantage @entity21 puts his finger to his lips while celebrating his goal after continuing his run of scoring in every round of this season 's @entity38 @entity21 is all smiles after notching his ninth goal of the campaign to put @entity26 firmly in control of the fifth round tie at @entity27 @entity24 jumps for joy after his shot took a hefty deflection off @entity28 for @entity26 's first goal after just three minutes @entity24 ( centre ) fires across the shot that deflected off @entity28 ( no 16 ) and into the net to hand @entity26 the early advantage @entity8 goalkeeper @entity53 was totally wrong - footed by @entity28 's deflection on @entity24 's shot and ca n't keep it out @entity26 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity57 7 ; @entity58 7 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 7 , @entity61 7 ; @entity62 7.5 , @entity63 7 , @entity64 7 ( @entity65 79 ) ; @entity24 7.5 ( @entity66 86 ) ; @entity21 8 ( @entity67 89 ) , @entity23 7 substitutes not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 manager : @entity73 8 scorers : @entity28 ( own goal ) 3 ' ; @entity21 62 ' booked : @entity24 @entity8 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity53 4 ; @entity76 4.5 ( @entity77 86 ) , @entity78 4.5 , @entity28 5 , @entity79 5 ; @entity80 5.5 ; @entity81 5 ( @entity82 86 ) , @entity83 6 , @entity84 5.5 ; @entity85 6 ( @entity87 ht , 5 ) , @entity88 5 substitutes not used : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 manager : @entity94 5 booked : @entity88 , @entity83 , @entity76 referee : @entity96 ( @entity97 ) 6 attendance : 24,021 managers @entity73 and @entity94 agreed on two things — @entity26 ’s victory was deserved and the ferocity of the tie was from a bygone era			1
but there was romance , too			0
for @entity108 @entity21 , scorer of the game - clinching second , was once mocked by @entity8 fans who printed t - shirts reading ‘ i saw @entity21 score a goal ’ after it took the striker 30 games to find the back of the net in their colours			1
he had the last laugh on sunday , however , and is now the only player to have scored in all five rounds of this year ’s competition			0
as @entity21 made way in the final minute , the joyous @entity27 crowd rose as one , affording their man of the match a spine - tingling ovation			1
in stark contrast , @entity8 ’s supporters were fighting among themselves , thus displaying more spirit than their side had shown on the pitch			2
for @entity94 ’s side were awful , beaten from the third minute when @entity24 ’s shot was deflected in off @entity136			1
at full time , the away fans booed their own players before hissing ‘ @entity94 , it ’s always our fault ’ in response to the head coach blaming them for recent performances			0
but that poison could not detract from the passion of the brilliant @entity146			2
@entity151 finalists two seasons ago , their list of @entity150 victims also includes @entity153 and @entity154			0
they are now one match from a third @entity158 appearance in two years , and on the evidence of this pulsating performance which married craft and graft on a bog of a pitch , few will fancy a trip to @entity166 in the quarter - finals , reticent television companies apart			1
@entity26 outfought and outthought the @entity169 to reach the quarter - finals for the first time in 39 years			1
the pitch , in the end , was a leveller , and at times @entity26 did drop to the level of @entity8			1
in a forewarning of @entity8 ’s anaemic display , @entity176 playmaker @entity81 appeared scared of the ball as it dropped inside the first minute , ducking out of a free header			2
@entity26 's @entity62 and @entity58 ( right ) celebrate in front of the fans at the final whistle @entity59 strikes a pose at the end of @entity26 's latest giant - killing act as the @entity146 booked their place in the last eight he was n’t the only player in blue guilty of freezing during a frenzied start and @entity26 ’s opening goal came as no surprise			1
@entity62 delivered a free - kick from the right and , when the visitors failed to clear , @entity24 took advantage to blast home off @entity136 at the far post			2
not content with rattling their guests with that goal , brutish and bearded centre back @entity59 thundered through the back of @entity85 when competing for a high ball and the pair only returned to the action some minutes later , bloodied and bandaged			0
further evidence of @entity8 ’s lacklustre approach came when @entity88 , refusing to retreat from a free - kick , was booked after his limp leg blocked the attempt to restart			2
@entity26 were threatening a second and it would have been well deserved had @entity21 ’s header from @entity215 ’s centre bounced inside the post rather than creeping wide			1
but @entity8 should have been level on 18 minutes			0
@entity83 ’s shot found its way to the unmarked @entity88 , onside just six yards from goal			0
one touch to steady himself was understandable but the indecision which followed was unforgivable , allowing @entity59 to slide and hook clear			0
replays suggested the defender had fouled @entity88 , but by putting the ball in the net when he had the chance all debate would have been avoided			0
@entity8 finished the half in more positive fashion			2
@entity83 saw a snap volley deflected over the bar by a sliding @entity63 , @entity85 headed into the arms of @entity57 from @entity84 ’s lofted centre and the keeper then improvised to keep out a @entity236 drive with his knees			0
but @entity84 ’s most telling contribution came at the other end as , from his woeful attempt at a clearance , @entity23 returned a header for @entity243 to score on 62 minutes			0
the 31 - year - old stepped inside @entity136 before firing under the weak grasp of @entity53 @entity8 failed to fashion a chance of note thereafter and the sight of fans scuffling with each other should worry @entity94 , whose position could come under scrutiny this week			2
as for @entity26 , they set off on a lap of honour to the strains of ‘ are you watching @entity258 ? ’			1
@entity26 's players react with joy as the final whistle sounds after booking their place in the fifth round for the first time in 39 years @entity26 's players complete a well - deserved lap of honour at the end after sending @entity8 spiralling out of the @entity38 @entity26 fans make themselves heard in a sell - out crowd at @entity27 as @entity8 became their latest giant - killing victims @entity8 's @entity28 reacts with dismay after an abject performance saw them dumped out of the @entity38 by @entity4 opposition @entity28 tries to make an impact for @entity8 inside the @entity26 penalty area as they struggled to create chances at @entity27 @entity8 's @entity88 and @entity26 's @entity62 compete for the ball in acrobatic fashion during the match a bandaged @entity59 beats @entity8 striker @entity87 to an aerial ball during the fifth round contest @entity80 stretches out a leg to try and rob @entity285 of the ball as it bounces up @entity21 beats @entity53 to the ball but sees his effort go narrowly wide as @entity78 tries to steal in behind them @entity26 's @entity58 fights to keep the ball from @entity8 's @entity81 during the first - half @entity60 is sent flying through the air as he competes for the ball with @entity8 's bandaged striker @entity85 a @entity26 supporter dressed in a chicken mask applauds as the two teams emerge from the tunnel			1

@entity26 added @entity8 to their list of high - *profile* scalps after @entity38 fifth round win at @entity27
the @entity4 side took a third - minute lead when @entity24 's firm strike deflected in off @entity28
and they *claimed* a deserved second on the hour after @entity21 rifled in against his former club
the @entity146 had eliminated @entity5 in *sensational* fashion in the fourth round at @entity314
the crowd chanted ' are you watching @entity258 ? ' after the tie was n't *selected* for television *coverage*
@entity26 are into the quarter - final of the @entity38 for the first time in 39 years
