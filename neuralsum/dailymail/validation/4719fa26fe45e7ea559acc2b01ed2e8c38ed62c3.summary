interest rates are unlikely to rise until the middle of next year as the @entity3 tries to stave off a deflationary spiral , economists said last night			1
official figures revealed the inflation rate fell to 0 per cent last month – the lowest level since 1960			1
experts warned @entity9 is now just one month away from deflation as food and petrol prices continue to tumble			1
the dramatic fall in the cost of goods is likely to push back the timing of an interest rates hike by the @entity3			2
delaying a rates rise would mean continued rock - bottom interest rates for mortgage borrowers , but more misery for savers			1
the base rate has been held at a historic low 0.5 per cent for six years but the @entity3 has admitted that , far from raising rates , it could even cut them further to avoid prolonged deflation			0
lower rates would encourage people to spend , rather than save , stimulating demand and pushing up prices			1
@entity33 , senior economist at stockbrokers @entity34 , said : ‘ it appears interest rates will be stuck at 0.5 per cent for some time yet – i do n’t see them rising until mid- 2016 at the very earliest			1
the @entity38 found the @entity39 between february 2014 and february 2015 stood at 0 per cent with wages rising by 1.6 per cent while prices are flat , it means families should see their money going further each month ‘ @entity45 raises rates to curb inflation , but that is obviously not a problem at the moment , so they will keep them on hold			1
’ @entity53 , of @entity54 , said the @entity3 was now ‘ under no immediate pressure to raise interest rates ’			1
@entity57 , the @entity3 ’s chief economist , suggested earlier this month that rates could be cut to zero because inflation had ‘ dropped like a stone ’			0
low inflation , and even deflation , over a short period can be good for the economy and boost family finances , but a continuous fall in prices is harmful			1
by @entity66 the good news ... and the bad news bargain prices in shops could be used by employers as an excuse to keep wages low , while workers could delay big purchases in anticipation that costs will fall further – triggering a downward spiral			1
yesterday , prime minister @entity79 seemed unconcerned by predictions that prices would fall further , saying @entity9 did not ‘ face the dangerous deflation that some other parts of @entity84 may potentially have a problem with ’			1
he welcomed the lowest inflation rate in 55 years , saying it was ‘ good news for family budgets ’ , while chancellor @entity88 declared that ‘ prices are frozen ’			1
estimates released by the @entity38 show the last time inflation was below 0 per cent was march 1960 – when @entity93 was prime minister and @entity94 had just formed in @entity95			1
the last major bout of deflation came during the @entity98 from 1929 to 1932			0
it did not end until @entity9 abandoned the gold standard which the then chancellor @entity101 embraced in 1925			0
before that , in the late 19th century the prices of goods , property and shares fell sharply provoking a banking crisis similar in scale and danger to that of 2007 to 2009			1
in the early 18th century the value of the pound was fixed against gold and prices were flat and falling until the outbreak of the @entity116			1
inflation measures the rise and fall of 700 goods and services , from energy prices to clothing			1
but it is the plummeting cost of petrol , diesel and food that has dragged down the rate to zero			1
in the past year , there has been a huge fall in the cost of global wholesale oil , causing prices at the pump to tumble by almost 17 per cent			1
an aggressive supermarket price war has also dragged down the inflation rate , as major stores have been forced to compete with budget rivals such as @entity138 and @entity139			0
the @entity38 reported that food prices had fallen by more than 3 per cent in february compared with a year earlier			1
economist @entity141 , at @entity142 , said : ‘ the @entity9 is now within a whisker of deflation			0
‘ it looks odds - on that inflation will turn negative in march , when the recent cut in gas prices by @entity151 show up in the inflation figures for the first time			2
we still think that deflation in the @entity9 will be a “ good ” development , giving households ’ incomes a welcome boost and supporting the economic recovery this year			1
’ @entity160 , of @entity161 , said there was ‘ a good chance inflation could turn negative next month ’			2
economist @entity164 , at @entity165 , said : ‘ rather than being a concern , the drop in inflation is a boon to the economy , providing households with greater spending power at a time when pay growth remains frustratingly weak			0
’ chief secretary to the treasury @entity175 said that , as pay rises pull ahead of price increases , people had more money in their pockets , helping ‘ millions of families ’			1
but shadow treasury minister @entity183 said it was external factors that had brought down inflation , rather than the government ’s economic policy			0
she said : ‘ a few months of falling world oil prices wo n’t solve the deep - seated problems in our economy			2
’ since 2010 , we 've been working through our long - term economic plan to turn @entity9 around			0
it has n't been easy – we inherited a country on the brink of bankruptcy – and i know many of you will have made huge personal sacrifices to support our plan to mend the broken economy and secure a brighter future for this great nation			0
but it 's been worth it			0
day by day , month by month , @entity9 's getting stronger : jobs are on the rise , the deficit 's down , the economy 's growing and wages are going further			1
and there 's more good news for family budgets , with the inflation figures announced today at a record low of zero per cent			1
@entity79 told @entity218 the figures were ' more good news for family budgets ' and proof the government 's economic plan is working at a time when the world economy is increasingly unstable , these latest figures are a reminder that we 're on the right track – and that doing things differently would put it all at risk			1
it 's a reminder that only the @entity233 have a plan to build a stronger economy , improve living standards and make families across @entity9 more financially secure			2
we want to help hardworking people keep more of the money they earn			2
it is individuals – not governments – who know best how to spend their money			2
that 's why , in @entity187 , we 've cut income tax for 26 million by raising the personal allowance to over £ 10,000 – and we will go further in the next @entity248			0
that 's why we 've frozen fuel duty for the longest time in 20 years , saving a typical family £ 10 each time they fill up			2
that 's why we 've secured the biggest ever cash rise in the state pension , which will be £ 950 higher than it was in 2010			2
that 's why we 're introducing tax - free childcare – helping out parents with hefty childcare bills			0
that 's why we provided funding to freeze council tax bills , putting more money in hardworking taxpayers ' pockets			2
do n't just take me by my word			0
judge me by my record in @entity187 : we 've delivered 2 million quality apprenticeships in the past five years , and will deliver 3 million more in the next five – giving young people the skills to go out and get a well - paid job			0
we 're backing business , industry and enterprise – creating 1,000 jobs a day and driving down unemployment - now at its lowest level since 2008			0
we 're getting @entity9 building again , helping young people to own their own home			0
we 've already announced 200,000 cut - price homes for first - time buyers under 40			0
and we will now help first - time buyers save for a deposit			0
a strong economy is the backbone of a strong nation			0
and a strong nation is built on people who work hard and want to get on life			0
mums and dads working round the clock to put food on the table and do the best they can for their children ; grandparents who 've saved hard all their lives to support their loved ones in times of need ; sons and daughters who want to get on with their lives , get a job , get a home , and make something of themselves			2
a conservative government after may 8 will carry on working through our plan to secure a brighter future for you , your family and for @entity9			2
step by step , milestone after milestone			0
last week it was a record increase in the minimum wage , today it 's the rate of inflation			0
this government has a long - term plan – and we 're determined to make it work for you .			0

@entity324 falls to 0 **%** , meaning prices did not rise in a year
@entity327 falls in food and petrol costs helped to ease the pressure on families
@entity79 tells @entity218 it is ' more good news for family budgets '
wages rising by 1.6 **%** means workers should see their money go further
