by @entity1 reporter published : 18:03 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 4 february 2013 @entity2 said today that the @entity3 should be open to gay members			1
the organization is discussing ending a longstanding ban on gay members and allowing local organizations to decide their own policy			1
the president said he supported the change today as he gave an interview ahead of this year 's @entity13 at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
changes : @entity2 told @entity17 on @entity18 that the @entity3 should reverse their policy which puts a ban on gay members in his traditional @entity13 interview @entity2 was speaking to @entity17 on @entity18 before the game between the @entity24 and @entity25			1
he has given an interview with one major network on the day of the @entity13 every year that he has been president			1
@entity17 asked @entity2 whether the @entity3 should be open to gay members to which he responded : ' yes			1
' the president continued : ' i think that my attitude is that gays and lesbians should have access and opportunity the same way everybody else does in every institution and walk of life			0
' during the interview he also said that football was a ' great sport ' but that safety fears over the game must be addressed			2
the @entity3 have been debating on whether to lift the ban on gay members			2
a change in policy would mark a dramatic reversal for the 103 - year - old organization , which only last summer reaffirmed the rules amid heavy criticism from gay rights groups and some parents of scouts there have been years of protests over the rule , including petition campaigns that have prompted come corporations to suspend donations to the @entity3			1
change : the @entity3 announced it is considering a dramatic retreat from its controversial policy of excluding gays as leaders and youth members the @entity3 , which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010 , has long excluded both gays and atheists			1
protests over the no - gays policy gained momentum in 2000 , when the @entity78 @entity77 upheld the @entity3 's right to exclude gays			1
scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies , and several local scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy			2
more recently , amid petition campaigns , shipping giant @entity89 and drug - manufacturer @entity90 announced that they were halting donations from their charitable foundations to the @entity3 as long as the no - gays policy was in force			1
unfair ? @entity96 , pictured last june , hugs her son @entity97 , 7 ; she was ousted this summer after they discovered she was a lesbian the @entity3 won a 5 - 4 @entity78 @entity77 ruling allowing the organization to ban gays in 2000 , but has come under increasing public pressure in recent years from activists			2
they include @entity104 , an @entity105 with two lesbian mothers , and @entity96 , a lesbian mother from @entity107 who was ousted as a scout den leader and treasurer			0
' this is absolutely a step in the right direction , ' said @entity104 , who is founder of @entity112 , a group that includes 3,151 other @entity105 scouts			0
@entity104 said he would turn to persuading local councils to enact nondiscrimination policies if the change is approved			0
@entity117 said she looked forward to a day when she and her family might participate in scouting again			0
' an end to this ban will restore dignity to countless families across the country , my own included , who simply wanted to take part in all scouting has to offer , ' @entity117 said in a statement			0
@entity131 , an anti-discrimination advocacy group , began to press for a reversal of the @entity3 policy after @entity117 was removed from her son 's den and more than 1 million people have signed petitions on @entity139 seeking an end to the policy			1
more than 462,000 people signed a petition on @entity139 calling for the @entity3 to grant an @entity105 application for @entity112 , a @entity146 resident who is openly gay			2
@entity148 's scoutmaster refused to sign the application because of his sexual orientation			0
a review board for the @entity146 chapter recommended he receive the rank , but its recommendation was never forwarded to national headquarters			0
the organization has faced pressure from board members - @entity158 chairman and chief executive @entity161 and @entity163 chief executive @entity162 have spoken out against the ban - and some corporations withdrew support over the policy @entity167 , whose 1994 book ' @entity169 ' was among the first to examine sexual abuse in the @entity3 , said on monday the ' striking reversal in policy ' was likely the result of growing pressure from corporations			1
the @entity3 signage is seen on the @entity177 , headquarters of the organization for the @entity180 , in @entity181 this is a safe way out of this mess for the national organization , which takes the fight back to the local level , and says to a local leader , ' you make the choice that 's right for you ' , ' @entity167 said			2
' it 's essentially the @entity3 ' version of states ' rights			2
' however , critics of the @entity3 suggest that its recruitment efforts have been hampered by high - profile controversies - notably the court - ordered release of files dealing with sex abuse allegations and persistent protests over the no - gays policy			1
the @entity3 's overall " traditional youth membership " - @entity203 , @entity3 and @entity204 - totaled 2,658,794 in 2012 , compared to more than 4 million in peak years of the past			2
there were 910,668 boy scouts last year , a tiny increase from 2011 , while the ranks of @entity204 - a program for youths 14 and older - declined by 5.5 percent			0
in addition to flak over the no - gays policy , the scouts have been buffeted by multiple court cases related to past allegations of sexual abuse by @entity105 leaders , including those chronicled in long - confidential records that are widely known as the " perversion files			0
" through various cases , the scouts have been forced to reveal files dating from the 1960s to 1991			0
they detailed numerous cases where abuse claims were made and @entity231 officials never alerted authorities and sometimes actively sought to protect the accused			0
the scouts are now under a @entity146 court order , affirmed this month by the state @entity77 , to turn over sex - abuse files from 1991 through 2011 to the lawyers for a former @entity105 who claims a leader molested him in 2007 , when he was 13			0
it 's not clear how soon the files might become public			0
the @entity3 has apologized for past lapses and cover - ups , and has stressed the steps taken to improve youth protection policy			1
since 2010 , for example , it has mandated that any suspected abuse be reported to police .			0
