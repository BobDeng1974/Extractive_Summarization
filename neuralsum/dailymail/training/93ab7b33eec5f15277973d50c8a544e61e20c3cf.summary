@entity0 is currently @entity2 no 1 as the villain of the hour at this @entity4 but where does he really rank in the all - time @entity6 ? in most lists of men and women who have blackened their sports by cheating on the field of play or horrendous misconduct off it , the names of @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are invariably the big three			1
by such populist judgement @entity20 ’s chomper at bits of his opponents would not make the top 20 in historical context			2
not in the long term rather than in this very immediate heat of the moment			2
@entity29 n't that the tooth : @entity0 reacts after biting @entity31 ( seated ) at the @entity4 clash in @entity33 it is when absolute moral criteria are applied in the proper order that @entity0 not only nibbles his way into the reckoning of shame but gnaws his way above the syringing cyclist , the steroid sprinter and the snorting goal - scorer			1
there are four degrees of scandal – drug abuse , match - fixing , plain cheating and the deliberate inflicting of grievous bodily harm			1
in my estimation the latter is by far the most serious and the big six in this list reflect their gravity in this culpability			2
below them the places of shame are shuffled among the other classes of offenders , taking into account not only the extent of the negative impact on their sports but , even more importantly , how they shattered our dreams			2
these ratings also reflect an element of @entity74 interest since the nearer it hits to home , the closer to the bone			2
20 ) @entity77 to start , , one to give us a much chuckle			2
in 90 - degree heat at the 1904 @entity82 , which reduced the 32 - man field to 14 finishers , this @entity80 covered a mountainous marathon course in just three hours and 13 minutes			2
@entity86 , daughter of the president , was about to present him with the gold when it was discovered he had ridden 11 miles as a passenger in his manager ’s car			0
@entity95 : @entity77 made history at the @entity97 when he quit running the marathon and decided to grab a lift in his manager 's car instead - it broke down and he walked the remaining six miles ... many thought he won 19 ) @entity102 @entity104 ’s carefully cultivated image transformation from dingy , smoke - filled gambling halls to gleaming tv arenas took a hit when , in 2012 , @entity102 was hit with a 12 - year ban for match - fixing			1
shamed : snooker player @entity102 was handed a 12 - year ban in 2012 after being found guilty of match fixing 18 ) @entity112 @entity113 preens itself as a game for thugs played by gentlemen			1
cheating with blood replacements was exposed when @entity119 winger @entity112 ( bit on a capsule to fake a mouth injury in a @entity124 tie against @entity125			0
bloodgate : the world of rugby was shocked after @entity119 ' @entity112 bit a capsule to fake a mouth injury 17 ) tiger woods what happened in @entity133 did n’t stay in @entity133			0
the role - model image of the greatest golfer in the world fell between the gambling tables and the ladies of the @entity133			0
he admits he has never been the same since			0
nor has the game that made him so famous			0
villain : golf star @entity143 publicly admitted to cheating on his wife @entity144 in 2010 suffering : the all - conquering @entity145 maintains that he has never been the same since the scandal 16 ) @entity148 when @entity150 cricket captain @entity148 was fined £ 2,000 for having dirt in his pocket at the home of the game during a test match against @entity156 , it shook @entity157 ’s to its foundations			1
shook to its core : @entity150 cricket captain @entity148 kept dirt in his pocket to tamper with the ball during a test match against @entity156 in 1994 at @entity165 ... he was fined £ 2000 15 ) @entity167 de @entity166 @entity169 eyes were smiling when , at the 1996 games in @entity172 , their darling swimmer won their first three olympic gold medals ever — then crying when she was banned for four years after tampering with her urine sample			1
that deepened suspicions about the influence of husband and coach @entity179 , a @entity181 discus thrower previously suspended for steroid abuse			0
stripped : @entity167 won three olympic gold medals for @entity184 in 1996 , only to be banned for four years after tampering with her urine sample ... her husband and coach was previously suspended for steroid abuse 14 ) @entity187 most expensive baseball player ever when bought by the @entity189 , but became the poster - boy for steroid - abusing sluggers			1
@entity187 has been fingered , also , for betraying his team - mates by tipping off opposing hitters as to what pitches to expect			0
' poster boy ' : @entity187 of the @entity189 admitted taking performance - enhancing drugs 13 ) @entity198 @entity200 pentathlete went home in disgrace from the 1976 @entity203 after being outed by @entity74 rivals @entity205 and @entity206 for the most bizarre of all these offences — electronically wiring his sword to score hits in the fencing discipline even when it failed to make contact			0

one sobbing boy famously put into words the sentiment of millions of heartbroken young fans when he begged @entity220 outside the court : ‘ say it ai n’t so , @entity237			0
’ say it ai n't so , @entity237 : @entity225 's @entity220 was accused of his involvement in throwing the @entity226 to the @entity227 after receiving a $ 5,000 bribe 11 ) @entity10 usually cited for his @entity242 goal against @entity150 but listed here not for this form of cheating which , sadly , is common - place in football , but for being expelled from the @entity145 @entity4 of 1994 for the ephedrine doping which set a terrible example for his millions of young worshippers			1
two counts : @entity10 scored this ' goal ' , dubbed the @entity242 against @entity150 at the 1986 @entity4 scandal : @entity10 scored in the 1994 tournament for @entity253 ... but was then expelled after failing a drugs test 10 ) @entity255 the most infamous cheat in women ’s athletics , @entity255 was forced into admitting the use of performance - enhancing drugs at the @entity260 in 2000 and was stripped of her five medals			1

comfortable : @entity9 easily won the 100m in 1988 in @entity273 , he later tested positive for steroids 8 ) @entity281 of all people to open the worm - can of cricket match - fixing , @entity156 ’s puritanically religious captain was the most unlikely			2
yet in 2000 he was found guilty of collaborating with @entity287 bookmakers during a tour of @entity289			0
he died in a light plane crash three years later , still banned , still in denial			2
captain shock : @entity156 's @entity281 was found guilty of match - fixing in 2000 , he died three years later 7 ) @entity8 after years of denials , the cyclist finally confessed that those record - breaking @entity298 triumphs were fuelled by steroids			1

new entry : @entity0 is a definite on this list after he bit @entity31 in the @entity4 match last month painful ? @entity0 was banned for four months and nine international games ... he has only just apologised 5 ) @entity323 had plaster of @entity325 taped onto his knuckles for a world - title fight in 2009 , turning his fists into sledgehammer - like weapons			1

sledgehower like weapons : @entity323 ( right ) had plaster of @entity325 taped round his knuckles during his fight against @entity330 in 2009 4 ) @entity336 the worst of all football ’s assaults saw @entity341 ’s keeper hurtle out of his area in the 1982 @entity4 semi-final in @entity344 and fling his body at @entity346 as the @entity347 was through on goal			1

take that @entity0 : @entity360 bit a chunk off @entity364 's ear during a @entity369 title fight 2 ) @entity370 such are the pressures on adolescent ice maidens that this sweet little missy from @entity374 , @entity375 grew up so desperate to win the 1994 @entity145 figure skating championships and thereby qualify for that year ’s @entity377 that she and her ex-husband commissioned an iron - bar knee - capping of her main rival @entity382			1
bitter rival : @entity370 was so desperate to win the @entity145 figure skating championships in 1994 that she commissioned an attack on main rival @entity382 , seen suffering below bitter rival : @entity370 was so desperate to win the @entity145 figure skating championships in 1994 that she commissioned an attack on main rival @entity382 , seen suffering below 1 ) @entity388 the iconic all - american hero transcended gridiron and became an idol around the world			0
