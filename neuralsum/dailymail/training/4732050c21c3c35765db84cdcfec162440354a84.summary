if you have seen @entity1 and you ’ve been following @entity3 and @entity4 football over the last year or so then you can imagine the conversation supporters at the @entity6 might have had on saturday			2
i mean seriously – what did @entity8 ever do for @entity10 ? it was in the 71st minute when @entity8 flew down the right and decided to shoot instead of pass to @entity14 who had made a run through the middle			1
the error of judgement provoked a crescendo of jeers from home supporters and a couple of expletives from @entity14			2
cue the debate between supporters : @entity14 vents his anger after team - mate @entity8 failed to pass the ball @entity8 was jeered by @entity10 fans despite scoring an outstanding free - kick against @entity30 supporter a : there he goes again shooting instead of passing			1
when is he going to start doing something for the team ? supporter b : well he did score the second goal with an unstoppable free - kick from about 30 - yards out			2
supporter a : yeah but that ’s for his own glorification			0
when ’s he going to start thinking about the team ? supporter b : well he did play a 40 - yard cross-field pass straight on to @entity14 ’s boot in the first half that led to the opening goal			1
supporter a : yeah but that ’s today ! what about the rest of the time he ’s been here			0
what has @entity8 ever done for @entity10 ? supporter b : well he did run half the length of the pitch in the 85th minute of the @entity54 final , running off the pitch and then back on to it to outsprint @entity57 before shooting past @entity58 for the first trophy of last season			1
@entity8 lifts the @entity62 trophy in the air while surrounded by his team - mates after victory last may the @entity66 scored in @entity10 's @entity62 final win against rivals @entity68 supporter a : yeah but that ’s the @entity54 supporter b : well he did score in the @entity62 final			1
you remember the goal that finally put us in front against @entity68 and meant we went on to win the @entity62			0
supporter a : yeah but we always win the @entity62 , we ’ve won it 10 times			0
supporter b : well we had n’t won it for 11 years			0
supporter a : yeah but i ’m not talking about specific matches i ’m talking about in general			0
supporter b : well he has got 34 goals and 22 assists in 69 games since joining the club			0
supporter a : ok , so apart from making the first goal and scoring the second goal against @entity30 , with the pass of the season and the best free - kick of the season ; scoring the winning goal in last season ’s @entity54 final ; scoring the decisive goal in last season 's @entity62 final ; and scoring 34 goals and given 22 assists since joining … what has @entity8 ever done for us			1
september 1 : @entity8 signs for @entity10 for a world record fee of £ 86 million september 14 : the @entity66 scores on his @entity10 debut in a 2 - 2 draw with @entity109 october 30 : scores two and assists two on his first home start at the @entity6 november 30 : first hat - trick - a ' perfect ' one too - for @entity10 , against @entity113 april 16 : @entity8 scores the winning goal in the @entity54 final against @entity116			1
his first goal against @entity10 's bitter rivals , and his 20th of the season may 24 : the former @entity121 man scores a goal in extra time in the @entity62 final , which @entity10 go on to win 4 - 1 ... it 's a record 10th @entity4 title for the @entity3 side august 12 : @entity8 's third trophy at @entity10 - the @entity129			1
he sets up the first of @entity14 's two goals in his home city of @entity133 december 20 : another trophy for the @entity66 , and a goal in this final too			2
@entity10 beat @entity137 2 - 0 to win the @entity138 , with @entity8 netting the second december 23 : reports surface of a potential exit , and 54 per cent of @entity10 fans would be happy to see him leave for the right price @entity145 @entity146 included a scene where they ask ' what have the @entity149 ever done for us ' the 25 - year - old is congratulated by @entity152 after scoring a solo goal in the @entity54 final @entity8 skipped past @entity116 's @entity57 before scoring his side 's winning goal in the @entity54 final @entity8 , pictured with @entity10 team - mate @entity157 after the @entity62 final , has failed to win over a selection of the @entity162 giants ' fans and so they jeered and whistled and @entity164 gave him 6.5 out of 10 in their match ratings			1
perhaps there were mitigating circumstances			0
the @entity6 was desperate for @entity14 to score before he goes off to @entity169 for monday ’s @entity171 gala			2
almost as desperate as he was to find the net			0
and with the benefit of the replay , @entity14 ’s run was a good one and @entity8 probably should have passed			1
just as he should have passed the weekend before when @entity177 was in the clear against @entity178 – another bad decision for which he has also received a disproportionate amount of criticism			0
his first year - and - a - half at a new club has been little short of miraculous			0
it ’s difficult to think of any other player who has made such an impact in his first 18 months playing for a new side in a different league			0
yet @entity8 is cut little or no slack			2
@entity191 ’s interest in the player for now seems to amount to no more than the level of interest they have in all top players – laced with a little desire to give @entity10 back a little of its own medicine : you want @entity200 well we want @entity8			1
but if it ever becomes more than that , then the curious lack of warmth between the club and arguably its most productive signing since @entity206 will play massively in @entity191 ’s favour			0
@entity10 forked out £ 85million to sign then @entity121 winger @entity8 in september 2013 @entity8 kissed the @entity10 badge during his official presentation at the @entity6 on september 2 the @entity4 giants have been linked with a move for @entity213 while @entity191 are said to be keen on @entity8			1

@entity10 winger @entity8 was jeered by his own fans
@entity8 wasted *opportunity* by failing to pass to team - mate @entity14
@entity221 's side *defeated* @entity30 3 - 0 on saturday
