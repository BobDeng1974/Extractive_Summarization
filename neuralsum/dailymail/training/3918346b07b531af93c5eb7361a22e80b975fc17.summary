by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 19:53 est , 5 june 2013 a millionaire gave £ 628,000 to a man who threatened to reveal he had sex with a rent boy , a court heard			1
the married father of three made payments for nine years in a desperate attempt to stop the secret life of which he was ‘ extremely ashamed ’ becoming public			1
he finally went to police last august after telling the truth to his wife because he was ‘ nearing breaking point ’ over the demands			1
after eight years the married father - of - three finally told his lawyers and police last august about the alleged blackmail , @entity16 heard yesterday the man , whose name is protected by the court and is known only by the pseudonym ‘ @entity24 ’ , told @entity25 that he was a ‘ bloody fool ’ for paying up			1
the alleged blackmailer , @entity27 , 52 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , denies a charge of making unwarranted demands for money between june 2003 and august last year			1
a jury of seven men and five women heard that the man , who was chairman of a successful family company , contacted an escort agency in 2002 after reading an advert in @entity40			1
he was put in contact with a 19 - year - old , and @entity24 paid him for sex around nine times			1
they also took drugs together			1
still is alleged to have started blackmailing @entity24 after the boy ’s father employed the private investigation firm he worked for to look into his son , and he discovered the relationship			1
@entity24 told the court : ‘ i know if he had asked at the first meeting for £ 100,000 i would have told him to go and jump			2
‘ but i just wanted the problem to go away , so i agreed to give the £ 35,000 that was demanded at the first meeting			2
after that it became a “ drip by drip ” process			2
’ asked why he made the payments , @entity24 said : ‘ in order to protect myself and my family from exposure			2
’ speaking quietly , he said he had been led to believe by still , who was using an alias , that the teenager ’s father would go to the police and the @entity70 unless he handed money over			1
‘ i did not want my family to read about what i am extremely ashamed of having done , ’ he said			2
‘ i would think to myself , i have already paid so much out			0
if i paid another £ 10,000 , hopefully that will be it but if i do n’t , all the money i have already spent will essentially have been wasted			0
’ he said he was forced to sell his stocks and shares from time to time to meet the blackmail demands , but his salary and income from his investments was ‘ simply not enough to cover ’ the sums of money involved			0
@entity24 told the court he met the teenager after replying to an advert for an escort agency with an @entity89 telephone number in @entity40			0
a fee of £ 100 was agreed before he received a phone call from the rent boy			0
@entity93 , prosecuting , said the pair met three times in 2002 , before the rent boy moved to @entity96			0
in spring 2003 , the rent boy told @entity24 that he was living in @entity97 in a house that his parents had provided for him , and the two met about six times there			0
@entity24 and the rent boy stopped contact after he agreed to pay off a £ 2,000 drug debt owed by his friend in august 2003 , shortly before the blackmail began			0
the businessman told the jury that only his wife and a handful of relatives are aware of his bisexuality , and that most of his family do not know about his relationship with the rent boy			0
