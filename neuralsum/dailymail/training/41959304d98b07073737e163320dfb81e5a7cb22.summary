@entity0 took a step into the unknown last week			0
it was a funny kind of unknown , because everyone knew it was coming			0
but it was still a step into the unknown			0
we talk , naturally , of the appointment as @entity13 chairman of @entity14			1
sporting politics can be as dry as a stick			0
it ’s why this story has n’t received the coverage it should have done , especially in @entity20 , where we should be up in arms			2
and it goes beyond the question of @entity14 ’s involvement – or lack of it – in the @entity28 spot - fixing scandal currently being investigated by @entity30 ’s @entity29			1
let ’s begin by reiterating a basic argument : it ’s not ok for a man who has been instructed by the highest court in his land to stand down as president of his national board to then assume control of the world game			0
if @entity14 is considered unfit to run the @entity41 , he should not be handed the reins at the @entity13 , an organisation which – in theory at least – sits higher up the food chain			1
chief : newly elected @entity13 chairman @entity14 ( left ) this is not to judge him guilty in advance			1
it is simply to adhere to the basic tenets of good governance , as spelled out by @entity51 in his 2012 report into the way the game was being run			0
needless to say , his report has been all but ignored			0
no competent or credible global organisation would dream of appointing @entity14 until the question marks hanging over him had been dispelled			1
that this is even up for debate is part of cricket ’s problem			2
but , like we said , it goes deeper than this			0
for it is a question of trust			2
do we trust @entity14 to run world cricket with a multilateral touch , with more than lip - service paid to the notion that world cricket means more than @entity30 , @entity20 and @entity75 ? do we trust @entity14 at all ? certainly , @entity76 was unimpressed with his explanation of the extent of his son - in - law @entity80 ’s involvement with @entity81			1
when @entity14 ’s coronation was rubber - stamped last week in @entity83 , he was asked about the @entity29 ’s decision to force him out of his @entity41 position , however temporarily			1
@entity14 claimed he had ‘ voluntarily ’ stepped down			2
this came as news to many observers , because the same man who claims he volunteered to be removed from the @entity41 presidency actually appealed against the decision – twice			0
who was he appealing against ? himself ? @entity14 also poured cold water on the idea that the @entity41 would have walked away from the @entity13 had they not been able to force through – with the help of @entity20 and @entity75 – the financial restructuring of the game ’s governing body			1
the @entity41 , he insisted , would not have ‘ dreamed ’ of such behaviour			0
this presented other administrators – @entity14 ’s own allies , no less – with a problem on two fronts			2
both the @entity105 and @entity106 have tried to spin the line that their cooperation with the @entity41 was necessary in order to prevent @entity30 absconding from cricket ’s high table			2
question of trust : @entity14 was forced out of the @entity41 over his son - in - law 's involvement at @entity115 for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin as luck would have it , of course , this arrangement was also of financial benefit to the @entity125 and @entity126 boards			1
but we ’re quite sure this had nothing to do with their decision			0
no , it was all about keeping @entity30 inside the tent – a tent which , according to @entity14 , they had no intention of leaving anyway			1
or did they ? in early june , @entity41 secretary @entity138 said : ‘ we told [ the @entity13 ] that if @entity30 is not getting its proper due and importance then @entity30 might be forced to form a second @entity13 of its own			1
’ either the @entity105 and @entity106 exaggerated the threat of the @entity41 walking away , or @entity14 was stringing them along			2
both possibilities reflect poorly on the men who now run our game			0
then there is the question of the executive committee – ‘ @entity148 ’ , to give it its appropriately orwellian nom de plume			0
@entity30 and its ever - faithful courtiers @entity20 and @entity75 have a permanent seat on this five - man committee , which will decide pretty well everything that matters in cricket			1
to be invited on board is to win the acceptance of the @entity156 – a ticket to respectability and influence now that the other @entity161 nations of the @entity13 have been persuaded into voting for reform			2
so well done , for the time being , to @entity164 and @entity165 , whose representatives will make up the initial five			0
corrupt : former @entity30 bowler @entity170 is serving a life ban from cricket due to spot fixing in the @entity28 delivery stride : @entity170 in action for @entity30 in 2011 yet on all the other committees ( finance and commercial affairs , governance review , development , and anti-corruption ) , there is not a single seat for the @entity183			1
even @entity184 gets to sit on the development committee , which will raise an eyebrow among those who have observed with dismay the basket case that is @entity190 cricket			0
why this absence of proper democracy in the new all - democratic @entity13 ? no doubt it has absolutely nothing to do with the identity of @entity196 ’s chief executive @entity195 , who was a constant thorn in @entity14 ’s side when @entity195 was chief executive of the @entity13			1
the upshot of making three countries more powerful than the rest – and , let ’s face it , of making one of those three more powerful than the other two – is that the concept of checks and balances vanishes altogether			0
it never attracted more than a fleeting acknowledgement in the first place : the old veto owned by @entity20 and @entity75 , followed by @entity30 ’s dominance , saw to that			1
but cricket has now given the thumbs up to a scenario in which the notion of an independent executive has been tossed aside like an old pair of batting gloves			0
who , frankly , will look after the global interests of cricket if every nation is driven primarily by their desire to claim a chunk of the power and cash handed out to them by the @entity156 ? @entity14 claimed in @entity83 that cricket did n’t have an ‘ image problem ’			2
apparently he was n’t joking			0
but he might want to consider this : as @entity233 has discovered , when the administrators become the story , you know it ’s time to worry			0
@entity238 telling it like it is … and is n’t there ’s no question that @entity244 ’s new column in the @entity245 is required reading , as much for the between - the - lines interpretations as for the words themselves			1
his column on saturday contained plenty of salient points , especially about the captaincy of @entity254			2
but was there a hint of revisionism about his critique of @entity254 ’s second - innings declaration during the first test against @entity261 at @entity262 ? @entity244 was scornful about @entity254 ’s decision to set @entity261 380 in a day , arguing that ‘ setting out for a target of 320 would have been enough ’			1
yet when he arrived at @entity265 ’s that day , he tweeted : ‘ want to see @entity266 out 460 & @entity125 bat positively to a 380 lead then declare … entertain today pls , @entity254 ’s men ! ’ miserable run : @entity20 captain @entity254 lost the test series against @entity261 this month critic : former @entity20 star @entity244 in action for @entity276 in the @entity277 in the event , @entity261 were dismissed for 453 ( tick ) , before @entity20 scored at 3.86 runs per over ( tick ) to lead by 380 ( tick ) before declaring ( tick )			1
part of @entity244 ’s beef , he now makes clear , is that @entity254 should have declared before stumps , yet the excellence of @entity285 that day meant @entity20 were forced to recalculate			1
sometimes , the other team can play well too			0
@entity244 also claims @entity20 scored at ‘ 3.4 an over ’ at @entity262			1
in their first innings , the figure was 4.4 ; overall in the @entity260 , it was 4.2			0
there are plenty of reasons to worry about this @entity20 team , and @entity244 nails a few of them			1
but his case would be strengthened if he a ) took a consistent line , and b ) got his facts right			0
@entity302 ’s tears was the emotional reaction of @entity304 after the @entity306 defeat by @entity261 evidence , as @entity244 suggested , of an unhappy dressing - room ? possibly – though it feels like a slightly literal reading of lachrymosity			1
this column feels @entity254 is no longer the right man to lead @entity20 , but @entity304 ’s tears are not part of the problem			1
if anything , a team that can come within two balls of batting throughout the last day after beginning it five wickets down is full of spirit			0
the issue is not that they want to do well for @entity20 – it ’s that they are playing under the wrong man			2
another interpretation of @entity304 ’s response is that he cares deeply			2
in other words , all hope is not yet lost			0
hurt : @entity304 shed tears after @entity20 's thrilling , last - gasp @entity334 defeat against @entity261 brace yourselves … why does n’t the @entity277 come close to replicating the razzmatazz of the @entity28 – or even the @entity337 ? there are many reasons , and we were reminded of one of them last week , when it was made clear that @entity20 ’s players , with the exception of @entity346 , would not be released to represent their counties			1
on one level , this is understandable : a five - test series against @entity30 begins next week , and the administrators have deemed it reasonable to squeeze this into 42 days ’ playing time			2
but let ’s not kid ourselves about the wow - factor of our domestic @entity356 tournament when the wow - players tend not to take part			0
lone star : @entity346 is the only big - name @entity334 player who will play in the @entity277 damp squib the @entity41 were in such a rush to send out a self - congratulatory press release following the appointment of @entity14 as @entity13 chairman that they neglected to update the subject heading of their email			1
thus , a missive hailing a ‘ proud and historic moment for @entity371 cricket ’ ( well , one out of two ai n’t bad ) , will forever sit in our inboxes with the title : ‘ @entity375			0

@entity14 is new @entity13 chairman
@entity14 potential involvement in @entity28 spot - fixing is under investigation
his appointment calls into question cricket 's commitment to *members* other than @entity30 , @entity20 and @entity75
@entity244 bends truth in criticism of @entity254
@entity304 tears are sign of hope for @entity20
@entity277 lacks razzmatazz of @entity337
