the woolly jumper brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ' parrot fashion '			1
but @entity4 is n't merely trying to stand out from the flock			1
he was given the outfit to help him recover after he was starved for so long that he resorted to plucking his own feathers and eating them			1
still he liked the bespoke jumper so much that new owner @entity9 knitted him four more in different colours			1
wrapped up warm : @entity4 in one of his five bespoke jumpers and like a true fashionista , the green @entity14 parrot throws a tantrum if he is forced to change - stamping his feet , flapping his wings and squawking			1
he gets very , very agitated , ’ she said			2
‘ the first summer after we had him it was red hot and i thought he was going to melt with his woolly on			1
i took it off and he started to go bonkers			2
i put it back on and he just calmed down straight away ! ‘ he went in a real grump , so after a while we just gave up trying			2
it ’s like his comfort blanket			2
’ mrs @entity9 , 47 , who is an area co-ordinator for the @entity32 parrot rescue centre , took @entity4 into her home after hearing about his poor health when rescued			1
a peck on the cheek : @entity4 with his owner @entity9 who created his wardrobe of jumpers his condition was so weak that he could n’t sit on his perch without falling off			1
at first , she waited for his feathers to grow back , but decided in the meantime to knit him five woollen cardigans - one blue , green , white and yellow - to keep him warm			1
mrs @entity9 , who lives in @entity46 , @entity47 , said his favourite cardigan is the yellow one			0
she added : ‘ i am quite tough but when i saw him i burst into tears			0
the worse abuse case i ’ve seen			0
‘ he had plucked himself			0
he had been eating his feathers to survive			1
he was at death ’s door			2
i just wanted to give him a chance			0
‘ he was extremely shut down			0
he would n’t move or do anything , he just sat there			0
‘ we had to feed him with a spoon because he could n’t eat on his own and he could n’t even perch because he was too weak			0
he was black and blue from falling off with his previous owner			0
’ mrs @entity9 finds homes for parrots across the country and currently has 16 in her home and 100 in the garden .			0
