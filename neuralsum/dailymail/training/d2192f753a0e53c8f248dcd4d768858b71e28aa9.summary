by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 19:35 est , 6 october 2012 the export of live farm animals from the @entity3 to the @entity4 has been suspended after two sheep drowned and 42 had to be shot at @entity6			1
the incident happened after 500 sheep bound for @entity9 were unloaded from a lorry to an area of the port normally used for washing vehicles			1
@entity14 fell into an underground water tank			1
four were rescued but two drowned			2
other sheep then got stones stuck in their hooves and a vet ordered that 42 were lame and should be shot immediately			2
stopped : @entity3 trade with livestock , such as sheep , has now been suspended since the incident in @entity6 last month where 44 animals died farmers have been appalled by grisly pictures of the animals posted on the internet and have questioned the qualifications and expertise of those who slaughtered the lame sheep			1
@entity6 had been the only port in the country which exported animals abroad for slaughter			2
following the suspension – by @entity38 – the operation was moved to @entity39 but that was also halted due to a lack of suitable facilities			0
the decision has delighted animal welfare organisations such as the @entity45 which have campaigned for years to ban the controversial trade			0
the shipment , on september 12 , had originally been stopped after an inspection found one sheep had a broken leg , another was injured and that there were faults on the lorry			1
incident : the 500 sheep were unloaded from a lorry to an area of the @entity6 port ( pictured ) normally used for washing vehicles two @entity9 hauliers have been arrested and bailed while inquiries continue			1
according to @entity64 , fewer than 100,000 animals are exported from @entity3 each year , down from 2.5 million 20 years ago			0
the @entity66 ’ @entity65 has demanded a ‘ full and frank ’ inquiry into the incidents			0
but @entity69 , chief executive of the @entity45 , said : ‘ there is no place in a civilised society for this vile trade that causes so much suffering			0
’ @entity38 said that live exports had been ‘ suspended until further notice ’			0
last night , farming minister @entity77 said : ‘ i have ordered an immediate review into the unacceptable events at @entity6			0
