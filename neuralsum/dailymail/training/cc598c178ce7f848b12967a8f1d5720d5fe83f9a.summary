@entity0 and sir @entity1 did book publicity in @entity3 over the weekend			1
@entity0 was hardly mentioned by @entity1 , while @entity0 , normally quick to mention his favourite f word chose to talk about another of his famous feuds at the @entity7			1
@entity0 ( left ) revealed that there is little chance of burying the hatchet with @entity11 ( right ) @entity0 made it clear that although he regularly came across @entity11 while working as a tv pundit , there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other			1
meanwhile , @entity1 was predictably given the easiest of times by @entity23 fan interviewer @entity22 who preferred to have him talking about his ‘ greatest experience outside football ’ — helping @entity26 motivate his @entity28 winners			2
@entity0 was shown a red card for pushing @entity11 , who had wound up the @entity23 skipper with his time - wasting tactics in 2001 @entity0 said later he wished he had punched @entity33 striker @entity11 after being sent off the ludicrous @entity34 watches farce continues with ethics committee investigatory head @entity36 writing to @entity39 chairman @entity38 warning him of possible disciplinary action if he does n’t return his £ 16,400 @entity42 watch , given as a delegate gift at the @entity44			1
@entity38 had already notified @entity36 that he intends to auction it for the benefit of a cancer charity			2
@entity48 used to work for @entity49 and is joining @entity50 ex-liverpool chief executive @entity48 ’s rent - a - quote role for @entity52 on all football business matters seems to have been rewarded with his appointment as @entity50 ’s head of global commercial activities — effectively replacing @entity57 who left @entity58 last week			0
it also may have helped @entity48 , who @entity60 called a ‘ clueless fool ’ for saying @entity23 may never return to the @entity61 if they do n’t qualify this season , that he has @entity64 links with @entity50 director @entity65			0
@entity67 had chief executive @entity68 at @entity69 but got sub-editor @entity70 to present their trophy for the feature race to winning owner @entity73 , as part of their protest about the cost of racing data with @entity78 who own the racetrack			0
the trade paper also cancelled all their usual corporate hospitality			0
@entity83 has delayed launch of his second autobiography but seriously tennis legend @entity83 ’s second autobiography but seriously , published by @entity87 , was due out this month but has been delayed by a year for a number of reasons including the drug - related problems of his son @entity91			1
the 28 - year - old was arrested in @entity95 ’s @entity94 last july after police witnessed him buying six packets of a white substance thought to be cocaine			0
@entity91 had been duped by his drug dealer who sold him baking soda .			0

@entity0 and sir @entity1 *avoided* *stirring* up more *bad* feeling
@entity105 pundit @entity0 spoke of his feud with @entity107 presenter @entity11
