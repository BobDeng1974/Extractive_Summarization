by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 has blown the row over the next @entity5 chief ' out of all proportion ' , veteran @entity8 cabinet minister @entity7 said today			1
mr @entity7 said the front runner for the @entity11 job , @entity12 , was ' not an arch villain ' as had been portrayed			1
his remarks came after the prime minister vowed to fight against mr @entity12 's appointment until the end			1
mr @entity2 held talks with @entity20 chancellor @entity19 and the @entity21 pm @entity15 over the appointment tonight			1
a @entity24 spokesperson said mr @entity2 explained that his opposition ' would not change '			0
mrs @entity19 agreed to hold a vote on the appointment , which mr @entity2 is expected to lose , at the two - day @entity5 summit starting tomorrow			1
minister without portfolio @entity7 today dismissed the prime minister 's fight to stop @entity12 becoming the next @entity5 president mr @entity7 said he was unsure why @entity12 was attracting such criticism			1
the former @entity34 said : ' @entity12 ? i ’m one of the few people – the prime minister ’s another – who ’s probably ever met @entity12			2
he ’s not an arch - villain			0
' he added : ' no one knows what he ’s supposed to have done wrong			0
the idea he ’s an arch - federalist , a sort of public enemy number one which the media have made him in the last few days is slightly exaggerated			0
' mr @entity7 said there were better candidates to lead the @entity5 - the @entity11 ' civil service which acts as the @entity5 's government			2
but he said : ' i do n’t think it is the most powerful post in @entity55			0
' this is another thing – i ’m obviously feeling in a slightly laid back mood today – i think this is being put out of all proportion			0
' there ’s one key principle , which is what the prime minister goes on about , which is what the choice of who the president is [ should be ] made in the first place by the elected heads of the national governments and it ’s subject to the views of the @entity73 , they have to approve			0
' that is the thing that @entity2 has got excited about – i think he ’s right			0
' mr @entity7 said it was more important for @entity76 to secure a good job for the @entity76 @entity5 commissioner			1
' my own personal opinion – this is n’t on behalf of the government – i think that ’s more important than who the president of the @entity5 is , ' he said			2
the prime minister said he would fight ' until the end ' against mr @entity12 's appointment , which is expected to be agreed by other @entity5 leaders on friday veteran @entity8 minister @entity7 said he was one of the few politicians , along with @entity2 , who had met mr @entity12 ( right )			1
he said the former @entity91 premier was not an ' arch villain ' , but admitted he was not the best man for the job the damning remarks came after the business secretary @entity96 said mr @entity2 's handling of the row over mr @entity12 had damaged @entity76 's influence in @entity11			1
the prime minister has cross-party support for his bid to block mr @entity12 from being appointed president of the @entity5			1
mr @entity2 has vowed to fight ' until the end ' the appointment of a man seen by the @entity76 as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform			2
business secretary @entity96 said mr @entity2 's behaviour had damaged @entity76 's influence in @entity55 but on the eve of a summit where he is expected to find himself isolated on the appointment by fellow @entity5 leaders , his approach was criticised by the @entity116 cabinet minister			1
' it has n't been good for @entity2 , ' mr @entity96 told @entity118 's today			2
' i think he is right in principle that the appointment of the commission president should n't be foisted on heads of government			0
' i think he was right to take the position he did but the way it 's been done , unfortunately , has not helped @entity76 punch its weight in @entity55			2
' mr @entity12 said he was confident of securing the post by the end of this week , ' if common sense prevails '			0
in an apparent dig at the prime minister 's campaign against him , the former @entity91 premier said he was being forced to wait for a decision because common sense was ' very unequally distributed '			0
mr @entity2 believes that the selection of a candidate chosen by the largest party grouping in the @entity73 would breach the principle that candidates for top jobs are nominated by national leaders and not by @entity145			0
having apparently failed to recruit enough fellow leaders to form a blocking minority at this week 's @entity149 summit , speculation is mounting that he might be prepared to deploy an arcane @entity5 procedure nicknamed the ' l - bomb ' to stop @entity12 's candidacy			1
the ' @entity91 compromise ' - created in 1965 to assuage the anger of @entity156 at @entity157 being outvoted by smaller countries - allows an @entity5 member to delay a decision which affects an important national interest until a unanimously acceptable solution can be found .			0
