ministers were facing fresh accusations of electioneering on the taxpayer last night after flocking to marginal seats across the country to announce £ 1billion in new spending			1
some 21 ministers , including half the @entity7 , made official visits to towns and cities across @entity11 to announce details of the government ’s ‘ @entity13 ’			1
between them , they visited 19 seats that are either marginal constituencies or neighbouring marginals			1
@entity33 announced £ 4 million to expand a ‘ business incubation facility ’ in @entity34 , where @entity36 mp @entity35 is defending a marginal seat			1
and @entity31 chief whip @entity39 visited @entity40 , in @entity41 , where @entity42 is fending off challenges from both @entity44 and @entity45			2
the visits and announcements will fuel growing concerns that ministers are effectively using public funds to bolster their election campaigns			1
because the trips are ‘ official ’ visits , the bill is met by the taxpayer			1
the high proportion of marginal seats gaining rewards is also likely to raise eyebrows			1
the @entity60 last night denied there was any breach of rules that forbid ministers from electioneering on the taxpayer			1
electioneering : @entity33 announced £ 4 million to expand a ‘ business incubation facility ’ in @entity34 a spokesman said : ‘ these visits are not at all about campaigning			2
' they ’re about going and meeting @entity70 on the day they ’ve agreed a billion pounds of deals with the government			0
’ but shadow cabinet office minister @entity74 said : ‘ ministers need to come clean and justify this expenditure			2
' they must prove this is in the public interest , not just their own electoral interest			0
’ the @entity80 last night accused the @entity36 of a ‘ desperate ploy to try and reverse their collapse in support ’ following the announcement of a £ 300 million deal for @entity87 , including £ 2 million to promote tourism linked to the @entity89			0
@entity36 leader tries to claim credit for recovery mr @entity33 yesterday sought to claim credit for the economic recovery and urged voters to keep the @entity36 in power as two expert forecasts suggested @entity98 was heading for an election stalemate			0
bidding to be part of a second coalition with either the @entity102 or @entity44 , mr @entity33 said that without the @entity36 , @entity98 would have been plunged into a debt crisis equivalent to that in @entity105			0
‘ economic recovery would not have happened without us stepping up to the plate and creating this stable government , ’ he said			0
mr @entity33 ’s pitch to remain in office came as academics at @entity113 @entity98 predicted a dead - heat between the two main parties , with only a three - way coalition able to command a @entity118 majority			2
the company forecast 283 seats for the @entity102 , 283 for @entity44 , 33 for the @entity121 , 27 for the @entity36 , eight for the @entity122 and three for @entity45			0
a separate forecast , published in the @entity124 , also suggested @entity44 and the @entity102 are on course to win the same number of seats – 273 each .			0
