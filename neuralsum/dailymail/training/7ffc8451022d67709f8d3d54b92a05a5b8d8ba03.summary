by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 12:08 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 19 july 2012 the government today gave the green - light to its first controversial new toll road since @entity5 announced his radical pay - as - you - drive policy in @entity7			2
but it sparked an immediate row as motoring groups said it marked a u-turn by allowing tolling on existing roads – not just on those which were new or enhanced			1
drivers will have to pay to use a 20 - mile section of the main @entity19 through @entity20 which will form part of a major investment in highways in eastern @entity24			1
controversial : a 20 - mile stretch of the @entity19 in @entity20 , pictured , is to become a toll road , @entity5 has announced although no charges have yet been set , drivers could expect to pay between £ 3 and £ 5 for the privilege			1
it is the first tolling announcement since prime minister @entity5 revealed in march a ' radical ' plan to kick - start the economy by allowing private firms and investment fund companies to compete to build , operate and maintain the major motorways and trunk roads in @entity24 and @entity37 , noting : ' there 's nothing green about a traffic jam - and gridlock holds the economy back			1
' he said radical solutions were needed to unblock @entity46 's gridlocked roads at a time when ' frankly , there is n't enough money '			0
he added : ' road tolling is one option - but we are only considering this for new , not existing , capacity			0
' motorists would not pay tolls to use existing roads , he insisted at the time			0
however , experts say today 's announcement suggests a significant policy shift as the @entity61 said entire stretches of existing roads which are ' enhanced ' can now be tolled – not just the extra lanes which are added , often dubbed ' @entity65 '			1
supporter : @entity5 has said : ' there 's nothing green about a traffic jam - and gridlock holds the economy back ' transport secretary @entity72 said the tolling was an ' imaginative solution ' to beating congestion			2
critics say it is privatisation by the back door			0
the @entity19 corridor scheme in @entity20 has been added to the @entity81 's major projects programme and work could start by 2018			1
funding for the improvements could be generated in part through tolling a length of the enhanced @entity19 , featuring 20 miles of new or widened road			1
but more work would be done ' to determine the best tolling solution , including what length the tolled section should be , how users would pay and what the tariff should be '			2
professor @entity96 , director of the @entity97 and a supporter said : ' today 's announcement is significant			0
' ministers have gone further than before by opening the possibility for tolling existing roads and not just brand new capacity - in this case a widened section of the @entity19 , a critical international trade route			1
' faced with the necessity to generate new funds for infrastructure this news demonstrates that @entity111 is being innovative in its thinking			0
' we would hope that work on enhancing the @entity19 starts sooner rather than later and certainly before 2018			1
' he added : ' under this plan parts of the @entity19 will be enhanced , widened and tolled in their entirety			1
this is new and goes further than was mentioned previously			0
' @entity119 , the @entity120 's president , condemned the change			0
he said : ' the worry is that essential traffic will divert off the toll route and clog up local routes leading to more congestion , pollution and accidents			0
' the @entity81 said : ' two new roads would be built in parallel to , with one on each side of , the current @entity19 immediately north of @entity132 for local use			2
' meanwhile , the existing @entity19 carriageway will be upgraded through the removal of accesses and junctions , and improvements to junctions at the northern and southern ends			2
' the @entity61 added : ' study work has confirmed that funding for these can be generated in part through tolling a length of the enhanced @entity19 , featuring around 20 miles of new or widened road			1
' however , more work will be taken to determine the best tolling solution , including what length the tolled section should be , how users would pay and what the tariff should be			2
' plan : the @entity19 corridor scheme in @entity20 has been added to the @entity81 's major projects programme and work could start by 2018 transport secretary @entity72 said : ' the @entity19 is a crucial strategic route for the east of @entity24 , vital not only for international road traffic using the port of @entity163 but everyone who relies on it daily			1
' this is why my department has been working hard to generate innovative and imaginative solutions to tackling long term congestion			0
' @entity170 said the tolls on existing parts of the @entity19 was a significant policy u-turn and could open the way for ' a tolling free for all ' on the nation 's roads			1
@entity178 mp , @entity170 's @entity178 , said : ' tolling existing roads is another broken promise to motorists who are being squeezed like never before by this out of touch government			0
ministers need to spell out how many road users will be caught by the new tolls they are set to impose on existing roads			0
' the @entity120 said it welcomed the decision to improve capacity in the area but felt that 20 miles of tolls could backfire as a road to nowhere for @entity46 's 35 million drivers			0
an aa / @entity195 poll in 2011 found that 58 per cent opposed the tolling of new roads ( 39per cent were strongly opposed )			0
while improved local roads alongside the @entity19 would be welcome they would risk becoming clogged with drivers diverting to avoid the tolls , the @entity120 said .			2

*proposal* to *introduce* tolling on @entity19 in @entity20
announcement has sparked anger from motoring groups
in march @entity5 said only new or enhanced roads would be tolled
work on enhancing @entity19 should start before 2018
