the woman , who would only identify herself as ' @entity10 ' , spoke out as police dug up the remains of @entity2 's four dogs , who were found poisoned days before his neighbour , @entity16 businessman @entity15 , was found shot in the head			1
@entity2 is believed to have shot the dogs to put them out of their misery and police are now investigating whether the same type of bullets killed the animals and mr @entity15			1
@entity10 said she has spoken regularly with @entity2 , 67 , since he disappeared a week ago			2
on the run : antivirus mogul @entity2 , seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor , claims he is being set up by the @entity4 government and lives in ' constant fear ' ' he 's in constant fear , paranoid , ' she told @entity33			1
' i would say it 's because of what he has been through			2
he thinks people are always after him , which they really are right now			0
' she added that she does not know where he is , but that he is not at home , as he had claimed this weekend			0
' it will never be ended until @entity2 is dead , ' she said			2
' that 's what i believe , until they kill him			2
' her claims come as @entity2 apparently began writing a blog , entitled @entity49 : the @entity50 of @entity2 about being on the run after his ' harassment ' by the @entity4 government			1
' i am asking all people of conscience to read this blog , and see the ugly truth unfolding here , ' he wrote			2
on the blog he also claims that he has dyed his beard and hair almost white and darkened his skin with shoe polish in an effort to stay ahead of authorities			1
killed : @entity16 businessman @entity15 was found fatally shot in the back of the head earlier this month ' i stuffed my cheeks with chewed bubble gum stuck to the outside of my upper and lower molars – making my face appear much fatter , ' he added			1
' i darkened and browned my front teeth			0
' i stuffed a shaved down tampon deep into my right nostril and died the tip dark brown – giving my nose an awkward , lopsided , disgusting appearance			0
' he added that he has changed his clothes , walks with a limp and speaks with a heavy @entity83 accent			0
so convincing is his appearance , he wrote , that ' while peddling small wooden carvings , i nearly sold a dolphin carving to an @entity88 reporter standing at the edge of my dock '			0
despite his fears , police say they have not named @entity2 a suspect and simply want him to come in for questioning , with someone else in tow if he would prefer			1
' my goodness , ' @entity98 , a police spokesman , said in response to @entity2 's fear			1
' he needs to come in so that we can clear the air			0
we are law - abiding people here			0
we follow the laws to the letter			0
we believe at this point that he has absolutely no fear of being killed by anybody			0
' beach house : the home of anti-virus software pioneer @entity2 in @entity114 lying low : @entity2 , is pictured at his former home in @entity116 , @entity117 @entity15 , 52 , was killed earlier this month in his home near @entity114 , on the @entity120 island of @entity121 , and @entity2 has not been seen since			1
three other people have been held for questioning in the murder and police continue to investigate other leads , authorities said			2
officers have searched @entity2 's home and dug up the remains of four of @entity2 's 11 dogs , who were fatally poisoned before the murder of @entity15			1
it is believed the neighbour had complained about the dogs ' barking , but @entity2 has denied a role in mr @entity15 's murder			1
' he did not like my dogs , ' @entity2 said in an interview over the weekend			1
' he was a minor annoyance			0
all neighbours can be minor annoyances from time to time but without them the world would be empty			0
i know he did n't kill my dogs			0

' i am certainly inside my compound			0
' as soon as the news reached @entity4 police they were on their way , spokesman @entity98 said , adding that @entity2 has several buildings on his compound and that any one of them could have hidden safe house			1
the revelation of his location seemed somewhat out of character for a man who 's said he 's terrified of being executed by @entity4 police			1
yet his behavior has been increasingly erratic in recent days			0
speaking briefly to a @entity186 newspaper , @entity184 , @entity2 , 67 , denied all knowledge of the murder of @entity15 and claimed he is being set up by the prime minister of the country , @entity189			1

i can not talk on this phone for long			0
my plan is a day - to - day plan , simply to avoid detection			0
' indeed , on thursday night , @entity2 took to the internet under his ' stuffmonger ' alias and asked for advice on how to avoid being caught because of his phone being tracked			2
survivor : @entity2 's @entity234 and a security guard stand near his home , where four dogs were poisoned ' how long does it take for a phone company to triangulate a cell phone signal ? ' said @entity2			1
' with what accuracy ? is there any way to confuse / delay the system ? if a cell phone is turned off , but the battery is installed , is there any way to locate the phone ? ' are there any brands of phones are more / less difficult to triangulate ? ' @entity2 denied he had anything to do with his neighbours murder , saying , ' i was at home			2
i knew nothing until the following day			0
' the founder and creator of the @entity2 anti-virus software business said that in addition to hiding , he was employing the use of a disguise to evade capture			1
however , he added , ' to say what your disguise is would be foolish			0

' my experience of this government has not been positive			0
the @entity195 is the right hand of the prime minister			0

' @entity2 told @entity88 by telephone that he did n't kill @entity15 , though he acknowledged he had differences with the dead man			1
' i barely knew him , i barely spoke ten words to him in the last three years , ' @entity2 said , speaking on a cellphone			2
' certainly he was not my favorite person and i was not his			0
