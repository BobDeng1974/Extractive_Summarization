president @entity0 has skipped his in - person daily intelligence briefing on four out of every seven days of his presidency , according to a shocking report released tuesday			1
the @entity5 , previously best - known for needling members of @entity7 over insider - trading deals that lax laws have rendered legal , used the official @entity11 calendar to compile a list of the days when @entity0 was n't scheduled to receive a briefing			1
the resulting numbers showed that he only attended the @entity16 42.1 per cent of the time			2
an @entity0 administration national security aide confirmed this to @entity41 on monday			1
' it 's pretty well - known that the president has n’t taken in - person intelligence briefings with any regularity since the early days of 2009 , ' the aide said			1
' he gets them in writing			0
' the resulting picture is one of a solitary chief executive consuming his intelligence briefs in a vacuum instead of engaging in two - way conversations with generals and spymasters			0
@entity58 presidents have handled daily intelligence briefings in a variety of ways , according to the @entity63 's history of the @entity64			2
@entity65 expected oral @entity63 briefings six days per week and hardly ever missed them , but that often allowed officials to steer the president toward operations that the agency preferred			0
@entity70 often got his briefings in writing but largely met only with his national security adviser ; the @entity73 was miffed that its reps were seldom invited into the @entity75			2
@entity76 was known for taking notes on his briefing pages as he met with his @entity79 , who would returned them to the @entity63 for analysis and @entity84 @entity83 was president , his briefings were couriered each morning to national security adviser @entity85			2
the president was casual about digesting it , but referred to it throughout the day			0
when @entity89 became president following @entity83 's resignation , he insisted on an oral briefing from the @entity63 as his first meeting every morning so he could keep up with @entity85 , who had become secretary of state			0
the personal disconnect between the @entity75 and the intelligence community has been a sore spot for the military , the @entity63 and the @entity73 since early in the @entity0 presidency			2
those tensions came to a head on sunday , when the president blamed director of national intelligence @entity103 for failing to foresee the @entity107 terror army 's rise to power			1
@entity103 ' has acknowledged that , i think , they underestimated what had been taking place in @entity113 , ' he said during a ' @entity115 ' interview			0
responses from the intel community were both fast and furious			0
' either the president does n’t read the intelligence he ’s getting or he ’s bulls * * * ting , ' a former senior @entity122 official told the @entity123			1
the national security aide who spoke to @entity41 said that ' unless someone very senior has been shredding the president 's daily briefings and telling him that the dog ate them , highly accurate predictions about @entity126 ( also called @entity107 ) have been showing up in the @entity75 since before the 2012 election			1
' ' we were seeing specific threat assessments ' from the intelligence community , ' the staffer said , ' and many of them have panned out exactly as we were told they would			0
' under the bus : during a recent interview the president blamed his national intel director , @entity103 , for failing to spot the rise of @entity107 bombing run : an @entity145 is pictured refueling before carrying out airstrikes in @entity113 on september 26 @entity107 , the self - proclaimed @entity126 , has steamrolled its way through one - third of @entity149 and @entity113 and left ethnic cleansing and millions of refugees in its wake			1
after the deadly 2012 terror attack on a @entity58 diplomatic post in @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity153 found that @entity0 had not attended an in - person daily briefing on the five days preceding the highly organized assault by an @entity162 - linked militia group			1
@entity163 , a conservative political group , leapt into the fray with an ad lambasting the president for skipping his briefings while maintaining a steady presence on golf courses			0
' mr president : it 's time to show up for work , ' blared the biting video .			0

report from the @entity5 examined the president 's *public* calendar every day since his first *inauguration*
he has skipped most of his briefings , attending just 42.1 per cent of them in person
@entity123 briefs can also be delivered to the president in writing , and he prefers to read them on his ipad
on sunday @entity0 blamed his director of national intelligence for failing to foresee the rise of the @entity107 terror army in @entity149 and @entity113
