the 57 - year - old , who earns up to £ 100,000 a year performing around the country , was caught on camera doing 88mph on a 70mph road			1
and despite already having nine points on his licence , magistrates allowed @entity1 to keep driving , as a ban would end his ' business ' as a solo performer			2

he said : ' there are so many spokes to what i do , and if i was banned from driving then a fair amount of them would fold - probably the ones that make the most money			0

@entity1 added : ' there was n't a particularly huge amount of consideration at the time - it was quite stressful			2
' magistrates ' chairman @entity72 said the speeding offence was ' obviously a serious matter '			0
however , she accepted the impact a driving ban would have on @entity1 's family , especially his ability to support his stepchildren ' at a sensitive time in their lives '			1
she added : ' but you can not use this excuse again in court			0
' @entity1 was fined £ 350 , ordered to pay £ 85 costs and a £ 15 victim surcharge , and given three penalty points .			0
