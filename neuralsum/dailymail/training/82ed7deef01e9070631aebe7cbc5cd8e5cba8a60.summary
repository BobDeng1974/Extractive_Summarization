a @entity1 woman has launched a new healthy chocolate company which specializes in healthy , vegan treats , which are targeted at women suffering from pre-menstrual sugar cravings			1
@entity6 , the creator of the gluten - free , all - natural , vegan @entity7 , has turned to crowdsourcing website @entity9 in order to fund her new food - focused venture - and has already managed to raise more than $ 5,000 in just ten hours			1
' we have all been there : boobs swell , stomach bloats , feelings hurt , friends and significant others become annoying , work becomes overwhelming , and the only relief seems to be a pound of chocolate and a good cry , ' she said on the site			2
eighty to ninety percent of women suffer from @entity7 , and thirty to forty percent find symptoms debilitating enough to interfere with their everyday lives			2
' after struggling through years of unwanted @entity7 - related symptoms herself , including violent mood swings , fatigue , bloating and persistent food cravings , @entity6 decided to take matters into her own hands and implement a number of lifestyle changes which she hoped would help her to conquer the impact of her monthly cycle			1
' i asked myself how i could fix this huge problem in my life , ' she explained in her @entity7 video ad			0
' i exercised more , even when i did n't feel like it , i would eat healthier , drink way less caffeine and get a ton of sleep			0
' all of those things worked , but cravings sucked the most			0
i would reach for cookies , brownies , and , while it satisfied me in the moment , later on i would feel guilty and my energy would drop			0
' combat your cravings : each of the chocolate - based bites has its own clever name , including @entity71 ( pictured ) which is @entity6 's original creation something exotic : @entity73 is a chocolate bite which has been dusted with ' fluffy coconut ' that 's nutty ! all @entity77 features chocolate , oats and pecans with a lack of readily available healthy treats in her cupboards , the entrepreneur decided to concoct the ideal antidote to her seemingly endless food cravings herself , focusing on healthy , natural ingredients which would create a delicious delicacy - without the added sugar and calories			1
' i went into my kitchen one day and threw a bunch of stuff into a bowl , ' she added			0
' dates , cocoa powder , oats ; i wanted it to be as healthy as possible			0
' i started to experiment , and after a lot of trial and error - i mean a lot of hours in the kitchen - i bit into this thing and thought , " my god , finally , a treat that i can crave , enjoy , and feel no regrets "			1
' and in addition to the more basic ingredients , which also include pecans and coconut , @entity6 also created her own special blend of herbs , which she believes will help women to combat any other unwelcome symptoms of @entity7			1
bad times : @entity6 explained that , in the lead up to her monthly cycle , she often found herself lusting after fatty foods , such as pizza and ice cream dr jekyll ? during the rest of the month , @entity125 is focused and together ( @entity127 ) , however while she is on her period ( r ) , things are very different all - natural : @entity125 's @entity7 use completely natural ingredients , providing a healthy option for anyone who suffers from sugar cravings ' the bites also contain dandelion root , @entity136 ginseng , and chamomile , ' the product description explains			1
' studies have shown these ingredients may be good for bloating , every day stress , and irritability			0
' @entity125 's @entity7 are currently available in three flavors , all of which have been given a suitably hormonal moniker			0
@entity71 is the original bite and is described as being ' crafted with premium fair - trade cocoa powder and hearty oats ' , while @entity73 comes complete with a ' generous sprinkling on fluffy coconut ' and all @entity77 - unsurprisingly - have been rolled in pecans			2
thus far , @entity125 's @entity9 campaign has raised just under $ 5,400 in less than 12 hours - nearly $ 400 above her initial fundraising target			1
her aim is to have an official @entity7 kitchen up and running by march , with the first batch of orders - which can be made as monthly subscriptions timed to arrive at the perfect moment - due to be shipped in april .			2

@entity6 , from @entity1 , started a @entity9 campaign on *wednesday* *morning* to help her fund the launch of her *pms* bites
she has already raised more than $ 5,000
the chocolate - based oat treats are gluten - free , all - natural and vegan
