in the @entity2 ' most populated city , the word ' casa ' can mean anything from the president 's Â£ 4.4million mansion - to the carriage of an rusted freight train			1
in an impoverished district of @entity10 , over two hundred people have lived in an abandoned train for over 20 years , with each of the 40 rusted wagons containing on average 20 people each			1
a community made up of railway workers and their families , the neighbourhood on wheels now boasts a primary school , wireless internet connection and shops selling tacos from cut - out windows			1

' there 's nowhere to hide when there is a fight			0
' the lived - in train is a rare sight			2
each carriage is the size of a shipping container , with a welded - out front door facing onto adjacent tracks where working trains run			2
advertisements for wagons selling chicken and fruit are painted beneath the high windows , while others have constructed entire concrete annexes alongside their metal box homes			1
washing lines wave faster in wake of passing engine cars			0
the area below the cars , where the rusted tracks and wheels have sat motionless for two decades , is used by some residents as attic space			1
others leave their children to play hide - and - seek around the machinery			0
attics : the spaces underneath the wagons have been turned into attics by some families , while others are used by children as play areas - and this one is used by @entity109 , collecting the grain he exchanges for cheap liquor community : entire families live in the wagons , known as ' @entity115 ' - a nod to the trains on which @entity119 migrants cross @entity10 on their way north to the @entity122 border railway : the wagons were abandoned because they fell between two companies when the railways were privatised - and neither claimed them peaceful : there used to be a lot of burglary in the area , but things have now changed for the best ' i used to love playing under the cars as a child , ' says @entity136 , who lives in @entity137			1

' ' there used to be a lot of burglary , ' said @entity109 , who lives in @entity148			0
' there was no security around the abandoned train station and gangs used to terrorise the residents			1
' things have calmed down since the community established a neighbourhood watch , people feel safer around the tracks today than they did a few years ago			0
' crowded : there are about 40 families living in the wagons in @entity10 demand : @entity162 , the @entity163 station master who lives in @entity164 , was given permission to allow railway workers live in the wagons by the companies - and filled each one as they were needed spacious : each carriage is the size of a shipping container , with a welded - out front door facing onto adjacent tracks where working trains run scrap : despite the community living in the wagons , the @entity178 government has decided it now wants them for scrap - so is trying to evict the families the community 's primary school , which teaches children up to age 12 , has had to expand as a result of the growing community			1
@entity188 teaches a class of 25 children in the converted classroom of @entity192			1
' it 's like any other school , except that i live in the wagon next door , ' he told the @entity57 , as the unruly @entity178 children ran amok during a maths lesson			2
' you have to watch the children very carefully at break times			0
we 've had kids get stuck in the machinery of the undercarriage before			0
' the primary school not only takes students from the 40 or so families who live in the train carriages , but also from the wider municipality of @entity163 , the poor district of @entity10 in which the train is situated			1
school : children up to the age of 12 are taught in @entity192 , which has been converted into a classroom learning : there are 25 children enrolled in the school , with some coming from the wider community normal : teacher @entity188 says his class is just like any other - the only difference is it is in a wagon @entity227 - eyed : ' you have to watch the children very carefully at break times - ee 've had kids get stuck in the machinery of the undercarriage before , ' says @entity188 when @entity237 was privatised in 1995 , the investors who took over the company broke it up into four separate , privately - run organisations , each of which marked out a territory in which they were to operate			1
' @entity115 ' , as its residents affectionately call the train ( in honour of the trains on which @entity119 migrants cross @entity10 on their way north to the @entity122 border ) sits between the territories of two separate railway companies , and was claimed by neither when the buyouts occurred			1
' when the railways were privatised the train was abandoned , ' explained @entity162 , the @entity163 station master who lives in @entity164			2
it was @entity162 who first organised for railroad employees to inhabit the abandoned carriages			2
' the company ( @entity237 ) gave permission for employees to live in the carriages			2
i simply filled demand as it came			0
' ' it 's a peaceful community , ' said @entity109 , who lost his legs 20 years ago , after falling asleep on the train tracks following a 56 - hour shift			1
when he woke up , he says , his legs were gone			0
business : @entity109 , who lost his legs 20 years ago , works underneath the railway carriages fight : the families who have made the wagons their home have vowed to fight agains the evicitions today @entity109 earns money by crawling under the stationary freight train which waits outside the flour factory next to his train carriage			1
' i could n't do it if i had any legs , ' he says			0
placing a tarpaulin under the carriages ' outlet taps , he catches any loose grains of wheat as he bangs on the structure			0
' i make tortillas to eat from the grains , the rest i exchange for cheap liquor , ' he revealed			0
last august , the residents of the train received a letter from the @entity178 federal government demanding that they leave the train carriages , since , as the remaining government assets in the railways are liquidised , the wagons are wanted to be sold for scrap metal			1
the residents are fighting the action			0
' this train wagon is our home , ' said @entity65 , ' my children were born here , it 's seen too many memories to give it all up now			2

the abandoned wagons have been homes for the families of railway workers for the last 20 years
about 40 families now live in the rusted freight train carriages in @entity10 , next to a working railway line
there is *access* to wifi and a shop , while ' @entity324 ' turned into a classroom teaching 25 children , up to the age of 12
but residents are now being *threatened* with eviction by the government , who want the wagons for scrap metal
