it is the world ’s largest indoor beach with 400 sunloungers - and not a cloud in sight			1
yet with up to 6,000 visitors allowed in at a time , there are bound to be towel - fights over them – especially as this ' indoors paradise ' is in @entity10			1
the @entity11 in @entity12 , south of @entity13 also boasts the largest indoor pool , 50,000 - plant forest - and enough space to fly a hot air balloon inside			1
the former aircraft hangar has been transformed into a paradise offering tourists a tropical escape , if you can ignore the fact that you are miles from any ocean - or the tropics , for that matter			0
a @entity97 company saw the potential in the hangar , which is the world ’s largest freestanding building , and @entity11 opened in 2004			1
despite the impressive interior of the hot hangar , visitors reviewing the indoor tropical resort on reddit complained about high prices on everything from beverages to accommodation and additional fees to use the popular water slides			0
some users went as far as to vent their disappointment in the type of crowd attracted by the tropical escape			0

’ there simply was n't much fun stuff to do all day , just the pools , even the mediocre slides cost extra			0
’ the resort , located on an old @entity141 runway , keeps a pleasant temperature of @entity46 , thanks to the modified 70,000 square metre dome allowing sunlight to shine through massive windows			0
and naturally , if it rains or pours , a quick common can be sent to close the roof - and everyone can remain dry and happy in their tropical paradise			2
lots of room for a slide : youngsters ( and adults ) can enjoy the fun of the multi-coloured slides that tower over the the ' beach ' of the dome beach accessories : along with the sandy beach , there is a spa , waterfall , whirlpools and water slides - something for each of the 6,000 visitors blue skies ( if you do n't look up ) : a basic board sells the illusion of a horizon , although there 's no effort to hide the rest of the roof view from the outside : the dome used to be a hangar for aircraft but now , although you might not think it , it contains a whole other world under the dome : restaurants and even umbrellas help complete the illusion - and not a cloud in sight the bedrooms inside the wooden cabins allow visitors to stay overnight - under two roofs			1

6,000 people can enjoy the ' sun ' - and without a cloud in sight thanks to the roof
the @entity11 in @entity12 also contains a 50,000 - plant forest - and room to fly a hot air balloon
