a polo club in @entity1 that launched with prince @entity2 as its first member has lost a legal battle with a @entity6 fashion firm in a bid to launch its own range of accessories			1
the @entity10 has quickly become one of @entity13 's most elite sporting venues since the @entity2 joined when it was founded in 1982			1
it 's attracted royals and celebrities including prince @entity18 and @entity19 , actress @entity20 and @entity22 @entity21			1
but attempts to cash in on this elite status by launching a brand of fashion and polo - related goods have been scuppered by the @entity28 after objections fromthe @entity30			1
prince @entity2 , right and actress @entity20 are among those to have frequented the @entity10 since it was founded in 1982			0
@entity2 was the first member of the club @entity21 , bass guitarist for @entity33 at the club with a friend in 1987 the ruling will be all the more frustrating for bosses at the @entity1 club , given that its rival is n't even a real polo club and openly admits to using the sport to create the perception of eliteness			1
the @entity1 club had applied to register its polo player logo on four classes of item including glasses , watches , jewellery and leather goods including travel bags , whips , harnesses and saddlery			1
but it was opposed by the @entity55 brand on the grounds that people could confuse the logo with their own and the case was eventually taken to the @entity28 in @entity60			2
while it allowed the logo on whips , harnesses and saddlery , which discerning customers were unlikely to get confused , it ruled against the @entity1 club on applications for the other items			2
it said : ' it is true that the polo player is facing left and holding his mallet upright , while the earlier marks the polo player is facing right and holding his mallet ready to strike the ball			0
' however , those slight differences are not sufficient enough to reduce significantly the similarity deriving from the fact that both the signs at issue display the figure of a polo player astride a galloping horse , ' the @entity76 reports			0
in 2006 , the club was also blocked from using its logo on perfume and soap after a challenge from @entity90 , famous for its @entity92 brand , also featuring a polo player , swinging a mallet			2
too similar : logo for the @entity10 the @entity10 was founded in 1985 by music mogul @entity96 , who made a fortune working with stars including @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 from the @entity103			1
after prince @entity2 became its first member , it quickly gained an international reputation and attracted stars from the music , fashion and film industries			0
it also became a favourite with the royals , with the @entity112 , father of @entity114 , @entity115 , being employed as the sponsorship manager			0
founder @entity96 died in 2008 , having spent two years in a coma after being thrown from his pony at the club			0
his son , @entity120 , is an @entity121 polo player and is now involved in the commercial side of the club			0
the @entity123 was also founded in 1982 and claims that seventy percent of potential customers surveyed in the @entity125 believe that the label 's name is a real polo club			1
@entity96 , founder of the @entity130 , relaxing in the garden of his home @entity133 : duchess of @entity135 , @entity136 , left , and princess @entity137 with @entity138 , right , at the @entity130			0
@entity114 and @entity138 's father , @entity139 , was the club 's sponsorship manager now internationally known , it boasts : ' the brand captures the excitement of the sport of polo along with the exclusivity of membership in a private club			1
' with its highly aspirational iconic logo , the brand was immediately successful in the @entity125 and rapidly emerged as a global brand			0
' founded in 1982 , it was originally the site of the @entity155 , a racing yard that fielded horses for @entity158 throughout the 20th century			0
it â€™s signature race rail and gallops can still be seen today @entity96 bought it as a rundown estate in 1985 , vowing to convert it into a premier polo club , but it was a monumental task for him and his team to undertake after a rapid and total transformation , prince @entity2 became the first member , attracting international interest			2
the first chukkas were played in 1986 since then , @entity6 stars and rock'n'roll legends have frequented the club			0
@entity21 from the @entity33 , @entity136 , @entity115 , and @entity175 founder @entity96 died in 2008 after spending two years in a coma			1
he was thrown off his horse while riding at the club @entity120 , a former @entity121 polo player , is now involved in the commercial side of the club and has plans to take it into a new modern era it 's currently expanding to provide two new state - of - the - art polo fields			2

@entity10 attracted celebrities including @entity175 , princess @entity189 and @entity33 ' @entity21
@entity28 ruled it ca n't launch fashion label with its own logo because it 's too similar to existing @entity123 's
rival brand admits it 's not even a polo club but exploits elite sport for fashion to make customers feel they have ' membership to a club '
