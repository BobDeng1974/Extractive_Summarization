' the retailer said it had replaced the confectionery with healthier snacks including dried fruit , nuts and cereal bars , and every food item on the checkout would be one of the ' five a day ' , have no red traffic light ratings , be in calorie - controlled snack packs or be deemed by the @entity88 to be a ' healthier snack '			0
the retailer said there would only be healthy snacks near the checkouts as a result of their policy decision @entity96 , the chief executive of parenting website @entity98 , said : ' popping into a shop with a small child in tow can sometimes feel like navigating an assault course			1
