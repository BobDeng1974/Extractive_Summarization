an advert featuring a man speaking in a heavy @entity3 accent has provoked a furious response from the city 's residents			1
it shows a brightly - dressed couple trying to plan a romantic holiday , with the @entity11 - shirted man repeatedly responding to the woman 's requests with the phrase : ' anything for you , cupcake '			1
but the light - hearted commercial for travel site @entity19 has riled @entity21 , who claim it is ' offensive ' and more annoying than the @entity24 advert , which sees a mustachioed opera singer bellowing out the company 's name			1
however , viewers have responded by saying it is unrealistic they have taken to social media sites to attack the tv campaign , describing it as ' appalling ' and criticising the actor 's @entity21 accent as unrealistic			1
' i ’m from @entity3 and have never heard any fellow brummies speak like that ! ' @entity45 said on @entity49			0
' go compare sales went down thanks to that annoying @entity53 bloke , i ’ve a feeling @entity19 is going to suffer the same fate ! ' @entity56 wrote : ' most annoying advert in the world , even worse than @entity24 ! and @entity59 from @entity60 ! ' annoyingly familiar ? : the company behind the @entity24 advert ( pictured ) are also responsible for the @entity19 campaign			1
they used a @entity53 opera singer for the comparison website 's commercial and have decided to opt for a regional accent again ' warm and friendly ' : @entity69 , marketing director for @entity19 , said they wanted to create ' a popular duo that people would warm to '			0
unfortunately for the campaign a number of people have responded to the tv campaign by saying they would never use the website it is no coincidence that the adverts are being compared to each other as they were both created by the company headed by marketing couple @entity85 and @entity87			0
they opted to repeat the use of the strong regional accent in the @entity24 ad , which features a @entity53 opera singer			0
@entity93 stated : ' not a @entity21 accent			2
that ’s a @entity96 accent			0
' and @entity97 blasted : ' bloody appalling ! i ca n’t believe this is actually a serious attempt to speak like people anywhere ! ' however , last night the holiday firm revealed actor @entity103 who stars in the advert was born and bred in @entity105 , @entity3			1
@entity69 , marketing director for @entity19 , said : ' we wanted to create a popular duo that people would warm to			0
that ’s why we cast a @entity3 born and bred actor as our lead character			2
having a laugh : the actors in the @entity19 advert seem in good spirits but viewers are not so amused			2
@entity56 wrote : ' most annoying advert in the world , even worse than @entity24 ! ' ' we wanted to use a friendly accent from one of the great @entity122 regions to help create a distinctive character so that people remember how easy it is to save money on hotel bookings			0
' @entity128 , part of @entity130 , said it wanted to come up with a ' truly memorable tagline ' and characters who would become household names for the new tv campaign			0
born and bred @entity21 : critics of the advert have attacked the heavy accent , saying it sounds more like someone from the @entity96			1
but actor @entity103 who stars in the advert was born and bred in @entity105 , @entity3 ' anything for you cupcake ' : the @entity21 actor says the phrase repeatedly in response to his partner 's holiday demands judging by the response on the social media sites , the advert could become memorable for all the wrong reasons			1
' your advertising campaign is a huge fail , i can imagine the majority of @entity21 are offended and the rest of the country are confused , ' said @entity158			2
' i ’d never use your company in a million years			0
