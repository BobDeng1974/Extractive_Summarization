yesterday , a study revealed online daters are more likely to end up in a happy marriage than those who meet randomly			2
i agree with the psychologists ’ view that it ’s because there ’s a higher motivation to find love among internet daters			0
there ’s a lot that ’s right about online dating			1
it ’s time efficient - simply go online in the comfort of your own home and view hundreds of potential partners on any number of dating websites catering for every possible taste			1
and it ’s convenient - you can narrow the search for a partner by listing what you will and wo n’t put up with			2
but the biggest advantage of online dating is also the biggest disadvantage			1
on the upside , it means the people you meet are likely to be more compatible with you than some random guy you meet in a bar who you know nothing about			0
why will you never meet the perfect man online ? because there 's no such thing , says @entity42 - and if you really believe there is , you 're heading for disappointment on the downside , it feeds into our already rampant expectations that there is indeed a perfect person out there who will tick all our boxes			1
online dating is like making a shopping list			1
you ’re effectively making a list of all the characteristics and features that make up your idea of the perfect person : hair colour , height , income , likes , dislikes			1
and the trouble with clicking all those boxes online is that we start to think there ’s someone out there who will actually have all those things			2
so when you do meet up with someone and quite like them , there ’s a little voice in your head saying , ' this guy ’s nice but he ’s not perfect			2
maybe the next guy i meet will tick all the boxes '			0
so you have one more online date and he ’s not completely without fault either , so you try another and another … and let me save you a whole lot of bother by telling you this straight up : there is no perfect person out there for you because there ’s no perfect person out there for anyone			1
@entity42 : ' we ’re human			1
believing in mr @entity96 is about as silly as believing @entity97 really does exist ' even if you end up falling head over heels for someone and they do seem perfect at the time , when the love hormones wear off , there will be one or two areas where he wo n’t be flawless			1
it ’s called real life			2
we have flaws and imperfections			0
believing in mr @entity96 is about as silly as believing @entity97 really does exist			0
the other thing i can tell you is the person you ’ll end up falling for will probably look and be nothing like what you ’re imagining right now			0
and this is the other great failing of online dating : it discounts one very important , extremely powerful variable - chemistry			1
chemistry is what ’s responsible when you meet some guy who is totally not your physical type and the complete opposite in personality to guys you normally get on with - but you do n’t care			0
it ’s illogical , irrational and out of our conscious control because it works on a primitive level based largely on whether your body wants to get close to theirs ( which is why you do n’t know if you ’ve got it until you meet in person )			0
the list goes out the window when chemistry walks into our lives and so it should			0
chemistry alone wo n’t guarantee you a great relationship but if you have it , you ’re streets ahead of the couple who do n’t			0
by all means date online - it ’s a highly effective and successful way to meet a partner			2
just be aware that the more specific you are and the more boxes you tick , the fewer men you ’re going to meet in person			0
the more closed you are about the ‘ type ’ you ’re prepared to meet , the less likely you are to meet someone who really is perfect for you but just happens to be one year younger and half an inch shorter than the box you ticked			0
@entity42 's new book dare : what happens when fantasies come @entity161 is published by @entity162 ( £ 7.99 paperback , £ 4.99 kindle ) ; her book and the @entity166 product range is now available from @entity167 .			1

the so - called perfect man does not exist , says @entity42
online dating sites *encourage* us to make ' shopping lists ' for men 's qualities
but *detailed* *checklists* lead us to believe dates should fulfil every one
