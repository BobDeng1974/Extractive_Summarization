by @entity1 reporter a @entity3 woman has become the latest adoptee to take her search for her birth parents to social media			1
@entity8 has been searching for her birth mother for more than 10 years			1
on wednesday , @entity10 took her search to @entity12 , where at least two other adoptees in search of their birth parents have posted messages they hope will go viral and help in their search			1
' my name is @entity8			2
my birth date is 5 - 21 - 1970			0
i was born at @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity3 , ' @entity12 post reads			2
' i am searching for my birth mother			2
any information can be sent to @entity27			0
thank you ! ' help : @entity29 hopes this image will be seen by her birth mother so the two can be reunited so far , @entity10 ' post has been shared 2,400 times			1
@entity33 says she was inspired by a recent mother - daughter reunion , presumably referring to @entity36 , the 27 - year - old @entity37 who posted a similar message on @entity12 in hopes of tracking down her birth mother			1
@entity36 's adoption story is slightly more memorable than most - she was referred to as the ' @entity42 ' in local media accounts after her birth mother left the newborn @entity44 wrapped in a shirt crying on the floor of a @entity42 bathroom in 1986			1
@entity36 began her quest march 2 by posting on her @entity12 page a photo in which she held up a sign that said : ' looking for my birth mother			1
... she abandoned me in the @entity42 bathroom only hours old , @entity55			2
please help me find her by sharing my post			0
' the photo was shared more than 30,000 times by @entity12 users around the world , and @entity36 's story landed in numerous media outlets			2
inspiration : @entity36 - dubbed ' @entity64 ' in the media - was reunited with her birth mother after posting this on @entity12 in march that caught the attention of the woman claiming to have abandoned her , and she came forward to attorney @entity70 , who arranged for them to meet			1
@entity36 said she bears a very strong resemblance to the woman , whose name she would n't disclose			0
' it looked like i was looking in a mirror , ' she said			0
@entity36 , an emt and married mother of three who lives outside @entity55 in @entity79 , said she embraced her mother			2
' i got the hug that i had wanted for the last 27 years , and that broke the ice , ' she said			0
' i asked if i could have it , and she said , " absolutely , " and just held her arms open , and the rest is history			0
' the pair met for about four hours and exchanged contact information			0
@entity36 said they plan to meet again			0
' we are definitely going to have a relationship , ' she said			0
together : @entity36 found her birth mother , @entity92 , left , after launching an appeal on @entity12			1
her adoptive mother , @entity94 , is at right @entity36 inspired a man - also from @entity37 - to use social media to try and find his birth mother			1
@entity99 - who was left in a @entity102 @entity101 's sink when he was just hours old - launched a search for his birth mother after being inspired by the success of the ' @entity42 baby			1
' @entity99 , from @entity107 , @entity37 , did n't even try looking for his mother because he had no information about her - but after @entity44 posted an image on @entity12 explaining that she 'd been dumped in a @entity42 27 years ago , it took her just three weeks to find her mother			1
inspired , @entity112 decided to do the same , and has now shared an image on his @entity12 profile showing him holding a sign reading : ' please help me ! i am looking for my birth mother			1
' ' i just never thought there was any hope , ' he told the @entity121			0
' being abandoned in a @entity122 , no records			0
after seeing [ @entity36 's ] story , and she found her mom so quickly , that 's what gave me the inspiration to do mine			2
' hopeful : @entity99 also has taken his search for his birth mother to social media , posting this image on @entity12 in april @entity99 still had his umbilical cord attached when a manager found him wrapped in a brown plastic bag in the sink of the women 's restroom in a @entity101 's in @entity140 , @entity102 in december 1977			1
he was given the name ' @entity101 ' because of where he was found , but his name was legally changed when he was adopted a year later , records show			0
@entity99 , who is now 36 and married , said he developed a close bond with his family and was devastated by the loss of his adoptive mother two years ago			0
he said he is n't angry with his birth mother but simply wishes to meet her and get to know her			2
@entity112 's search is yet to turn up his birth mother			2
the night before she posted her photo on @entity12 , @entity10 wrote a message to friends explaining how she was trying to find her birth mother			1
anyone with information about @entity10 ' birth mother is asked to contact her at @entity158 ' i will be posting a picture in the morning that i would be grateful if you would share			1
i am adopted and have tried several avenues over the last 10 + years to locate my birth mother and / or information leading to her , ' she wrote in her explanation			1
' i was recently inspired by a story of a mother / daughter reunion made possible via social media , so i figured it is worth a shot			1
honestly , i myself gloss over many of these posted " please share " pictures , but i am hoping you all would take a minute to seek it out and share			0
it is my birthday today , and this would truly be the best gift i could receive			0
i hold no preconceived notions of how this will turn out - good , bad , or no response at all , i will take it as it comes			0
thank you in advance ! '			0
