by @entity0 published : 06:40 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 07:16 est , 3 september 2013 @entity1 , 69 , broke 22 ribs when he was attacked by an 800kg bull on his farm in @entity5 a farmer who suffered 22 broken ribs after being trampled by a bull is on the mend - after being put back together with ‘ @entity11 ’ surgery			1
@entity1 , 69 , spent three months fighting for life in intensive care after being hit by the animal while rounding up his cattle earlier this year			1
surgeons attached a number of titanium plates - similar to those in the construction toy @entity11 - to his broken ribs to speed up the healing process , relieve pain and reduce the risk of complications			1
the intricate procedure was the first of its kind performed by surgeons at the @entity29 in @entity30			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity31 , in @entity5 , said : ' i would think i was one of the most difficult cases they have ever had to save			2
' nearly all my ribs were broken , there was not much left			2
they are now held in place with plates that look like bits of @entity11			0
' they are doing a marvelous job , there ’s no doubt about that			0
' mr @entity1 was inside a pen , picking out bulls to take to the market , when an 800kg bull charged him			1
' i had my back to one of them when he decided to hit me			0
he knocked me over and hit me again , ' said the father - of - two and grandfather - of - four			0
' my son knocked him off me and i walked up to the farmhouse and rang my wife			0
' he was taken to the local @entity59 before being transferred to @entity30 and was in a coma until cardiothoracic surgeon @entity61 and orthopaedic surgeon @entity62 operated on him			1
until recently , the only treatment for rib fractures was to strap them up and take painkillers while they healed naturally - a process which can take months			0
they can not be immobilised with splints in the same way as other broken bones are , as the ribcage needs to be able to expand and contract for a patient to breathe			0
but the pain - which can make taking deep breaths and coughing excruciating - can lead to complications such as pneumonia , because phlegm can build up in the lungs and become infected			2
mr @entity1 had surgery to attach curved titanium plates to each of his broken ribs ( pictured )			1
the surgery speeds up healing , relieves pain and reduces the risk of complications , such as pneumonia rib plating was first attempted in the 1970s and 1980s using metal plates and screws designed for other bones , such as forearms , but they were not flexible enough			1
newer techniques , such as the @entity97 system , developed in @entity98 five years ago , use curved plates sculpted to fit the contours of a ribcage			2
cuts are made to expose the affected ribs , which are repaired by attaching the plates with screws or wires			2
the operation typically takes around two hours and patients can be home within days depending on their condition and other injuries			0
fractures then usually heal within six to eight weeks			0
the procedure , which costs around £ 6,000 to the @entity114 , was approved by the @entity115 in 2010			0
the procedure was the first of its kind performed at the @entity29 in @entity30			1
image shows cardiothoracic surgeons @entity61 and @entity62 who operated on mr @entity1 cardiothoracic surgeon mr @entity61 said : ' we now offer rib plating for major fractures and are one of only eight centres nationally doing this			1
' this procedure will be a major help to our most critically injured patients and as a major regional trauma centre we estimate that this will help a lot of patients from the whole region , increasing survival rates and reducing their days on the intensive care unit			1
' mr @entity62 added : ' i ’m really pleased that mr @entity1 is recovering well from his major chest injury and surgery			2
it ’s great that we can now offer this surgery here at @entity140 as it will help future trauma patients			0
' in a study , fewer patients who had the surgery developed pneumonia than those whose ribs were left to heal naturally , and those who did not have the operation stayed an average of 10 days longer in intensive care			1
until recently , the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed			1
this could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such as breathing difficulties , pneumonia and chest deformity			2
the new technique , @entity159 , sees patients undergo a two hour operation which is available both on the @entity114 and privately			0
during the surgery , tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain			1
each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs			0
the recovery time from the operation is only a few days			0
the plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient 's life .			0

@entity1 , 69 , was trampled by an 800kg bull on his farm
he spent three months fighting for his life in intensive care
surgeons at @entity29 in @entity30 operated
they attached curved titanium plates to his broken ribs
this speeds up recovery , reduces pain and *prevents* complications
