by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ kie1410 it 's not too late to play @entity3 ! there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest - scoring manager ! as the @entity8 season gets going , @entity6 looks at players new to the top flight with the potential to light up @entity13 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity15 in a nutshell @entity15 was taught a harsh lesson on monday night against reigning champions @entity18 - do n't dawdle or you 'll be caught out			1
it is a lesson every player new to the @entity8 must learn and this particular 22 - year - old was taught in the cruelest way imaginable , gifting @entity24 the opening goal on his debut			1
@entity27 ultimately lost 3 - 1 , but do n't let that deter you from buying the left - back with a winger 's soul			1
@entity15 's £ 12million move to @entity27 from @entity34 , where he once held a 30m euro buy - out clause , remains one full of promise			1
and you can be sure the @entity37 wo n't dally on the ball in the box anymore - @entity40 will be sure of that			2
oops : @entity15 looks on as @entity24 scores the opening goal against @entity27 on monday night mistake : @entity15 's error led to the opening goal for @entity18 but the defender will have learned a valuable lesson no dawdling ! @entity15 is a left - back with a winger 's soul and his £ 12million move to @entity27 is one of potential born : @entity34 , @entity55 , july 5 1992 ( age 22 ) 2011 - 2013 : @entity57 ( 49 apps , 8 gls ) 2012 - 2014 : @entity34 ( 45 , 3 ) 2014 - now : @entity27 ( 1 , 0 ) 2013 - now : @entity55 ( 3 , 0 ) what @entity59 bring to my team ? points			1
the defender is at @entity27 , a team determined to show their title surge last year was not a fluke			2
and @entity40 is a man who knows bidding to become champions starts at the back , which means clean - sheets galore for those of you willing to spend £ 5.6m on the 5ft 7in @entity37			1
granted , @entity15 made a mistake in his first - ever @entity8 game but still held a 90.5 per cent pass completion rate against arguably the toughest opponents in the top division			1
last year at @entity34 , he chipped in with three @entity80 goals and began to average a shot a game			0
will he up his accuracy at @entity84 ? it may be worth a shot ... debutant : @entity15 was taught a harsh lesson on monday evening against reigning champions @entity18 potential : @entity15 once held a 30m euro buy - out clause at @entity34 and has started to show an attacking side at £ 5.6m , @entity15 is a steal			1
that 's cheaper than a host of players who may not even make it into their side 's starting xis ! click here to @entity98 for £ 5.6m stop sugar - coating it - how will he get me points ? an appearance earns you two points - check			1
a win earns you three more - check			0
a clean - sheet will add another four - check			0
it 'll add up week in , week out when it comes to a player of @entity15 's quality			2
and lest we forget , a goal from the defender adds 10 every time ! he found his shooting boots last season in @entity80 so he will come to @entity13 full of confidence to nab the occasional goal			0
but can he handle the @entity8 ? two years ago @entity15 was a @entity34 reserve player			1
he beat off competition to become a first - team regular , earned three caps for @entity55 along the way , and is now at @entity27			1
quite the transition in just two short years for the 22 - year - old , who clearly has potential in his locker			0
adjustment time is always needed - that 's a given - but @entity15 wo n't be alone in settling in			1
former @entity130 team - mate and friend @entity129 is just a short drive away , as is @entity133			2
and if they do n't feel like a chat in his native tongue , his new manager @entity40 speaks fluent @entity138			0
adding up : a goal from the defender adds 10 points every time and @entity15 found his shooting boots last year ready : @entity15 will come to @entity13 full of confidence to nab the occasional goal , particularly in front of the @entity147 do n't just take our word for it ... if ever you need convincing that @entity15 has a place tied down in the @entity27 starting @entity153 , then @entity40 is here to put your mind at ease			1
' ( @entity15 ) has got huge potential , ' @entity40 told @entity27 's official website			1
' he 's a really exciting young player			0
when you watch him , he 's very attack - minded , very quick and he serves the ball really well			2
' at 22 , he 's hungry to succeed			0
he has got improvements to make but he 's one of the players we 've brought in this summer who is ready to play straight away			0
' we had a practice game here last week and he looked very good			0
he 's one who is coming straight out of @entity80			0
he 's come from the @entity165 champions			0
' he 's done great			0
last season he was one of the top left - backs in @entity167 and was highly sought after			2
he 's a boy that will fit well into our way of working			0
' instructions : @entity15 was a @entity34 reserve player two years ago but upped the ranks and was capped for @entity55 i 'm not sure ... can he handle it ? he will thrive off @entity84			2
some players might shy away from the intense atmosphere - not @entity15			2
he ’s a football fan who grew up watching a @entity34 side that won back - to - back @entity167 cups and two @entity138 cups six - to - seven years ago under @entity181			1
he stood on the stands of the @entity183 and cheered on @entity184 as a teenager			0
he knows what those in the @entity147 and surrounding stands want to see , and will endeavour to bring it			0
atmosphere : @entity15 used to go watch @entity34 as a teenager and will know what the fans at @entity84 want to see			0

@entity15 made his @entity8 debut against @entity18
the @entity27 left - back made a *costly* error but will have learned from it
