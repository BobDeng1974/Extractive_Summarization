by @entity0 a @entity2 town believed to be the most ‘ seismically active ’ area in the @entity4 has experienced more than 30 small earthquakes in the last 50 days			1
geologists have said that mining in the area is likely to explain @entity10 ’s large number of tremors , which have had recorded magnitudes of up to 1.7			1
there have been 36 tremors recorded in @entity10 since december 10 , 2013			1
in this period , there have been a total of 49 around the @entity4 isles			1
@entity10 , @entity2 , has been the setting for 36 out of 49 tremors recorded across the @entity21 in the last 50 days			1
the latest was recorded yesterday at 3am , with a magnitude of 1.5 shown here are the epicentres of earthquake activity around @entity10			2
the yellow circles show events since december 2013			2
the red circles show historical earthquake activity in the last week alone , there have been five small earthquakes in the area , the last of which was recorded yesterday at 3am with a magnitude of 1.5			1
according to the @entity37 , @entity36 said the recent earthquakes could have been the result of mining at @entity41			1
but the body said residents should not be concerned			0
the @entity44 said it is possible that all of the tremors in the area have originated from the same location			0
it also said that many of the tremors have been felt by local residents			0
the red circles on this map show mining seismicity alongside natural background earthquake activity this graph shows the 36 earthquakes recorded in @entity10 , @entity2 , since december 10 the @entity44 said : ‘ earthquakes of this size are not likely to cause any damage and the hazard from mining - induced seismicity in the @entity4 is typically low			1
’ the body added that there have been no reports of structural damage from mining - induced earthquakes in the @entity4 for 40 years and the maximum observed has had a magnitude of around three			1
although the @entity44 said the tremors are not always detectable , one new @entity10 resident has complained of the damage they are causing			0
@entity78 has told how earthquakes in the @entity10 area have caused damage in her home @entity78 , who runs butcher ship @entity83 in the town , claims the tremors regularly send plant pots and pictures in her kitchen crashing to the floor			1
‘ i was baking in the kitchen and the next thing , everything fell off the shelf and i thought , “ i bet that 's been another earthquake ”			0
’ however , she said she does n't find the earthquakes scary : ‘ i do n't mind [ them ] at all			0
' i 'm not about to be sucked into a hole			0
it 's no big deal really			0
’ earthquakes are usually the result of a slip along per - existing faults in the earth			2
according to the @entity44 , human activities , including mining , can change the state of stress near faults			0
likely causes of changing stress are the ‘ removal of sub-surface rock ' , or it can also be caused ' by the collapse of old mine workings , which can move the faults closer to failure and result in induced earthquakes ’			2
the body says : ‘ this process is only likely to affect faults within relatively small distances of the stress perturbation and mining induced earthquakes generally within of a few kilometres of the mining activity			2
‘ similarly , sometimes the induced events occur shortly after the mining activity begins , but in other cases they happen long after it has ceased			0

magnitudes of up to 1.7 have been recorded in the area since december 10
in this period , 49 have been recorded across the @entity21 as a whole
geologists have said the earthquakes could be the result of mining at @entity41
