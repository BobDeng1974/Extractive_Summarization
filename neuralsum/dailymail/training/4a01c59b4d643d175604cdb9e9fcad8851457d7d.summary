a woman has had an aggressive cancerous tumour removed after the dog she rescued from a life of misery sniffed out an aggressive tumour in the nick of time			1
@entity8 , 46 , had no idea she had a cancerous lump in her breast until her two - year - old border collie @entity12 began to repeatedly cry , paw and nuzzle at her chest - and she now credits him with saving her life			1
the mother - of - four from @entity17 wondered what was wrong , and when she put her hand to her chest she realised she had a lump			1
she has also been given the welcome news that the disease has not spread to her lymph nodes			2
in the two weeks before she was operated on the lump had grown by an incredible five millimetres and @entity8 believes that if it was n't for @entity12 she could have been dead by summer			2
she said : ' when i got the results from the hospital and was told the cancer had not spread the relief i felt was incredible and it is all down to @entity12			1
' it was also at this point that i was told that the tumour i had was particularly aggressive and had been growing very quickly			1
if i 'd left it any later before going to the doctor the consequences do not bear thinking about			2
' i have had @entity12 for about a year and he was quite a timid dog when i first got him but we soon became very close			1
he had been badly abused and the bond we formed was incredibly close			0
despite rescuing @entity12 from being abused , @entity8 says she now feels she owes him a debt for saving her ' i feel as though it is fate that we found each other			0
i saved him , then he saved me			0
' he is not normally very affectionate , and would never usually paw me in such a way			0
that is why i knew something was wrong			0
' the first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast			1
most breast lumps ( 90 per cent ) are n't cancerous , but it 's always best to have them checked by your doctor			1
you should see your gp if you notice any of the following : breast pain is n't usually a symptom of breast cancer			1
source : @entity77 @entity8 , a mother - of - four and grandmother - of - two , bought @entity12 after seeing him for sale online , but when she turned up at his home she realised there was something wrong			0
@entity12 's owners barely spoke to her and bundled the animal into her car straight away before @entity8 took him to the vets			1
she was told that @entity12 had suffered a blow to the head and that it was highly likely he had been kept in a very small cage			0
his muscles had wasted away and he was barely able to walk			0
but after some tender loving care from @entity93 made a dramatic recovery			0
@entity8 added : ' we are very close			0
i have had other dogs , but never formed as strong a bond with them as i have done with @entity12			0
' @entity8 , who lives with her delivery driver husband @entity101 , 47 , had the lump removed mid-december 2014 and last week learned that the cancer had not spread			1
she suffers from benign breast disease which causes regular lumps , which are harmless and never usually worry her			2
stay - at - home - mum @entity8 now wants to let other people know that they should take notice of dogs if they start to draw attention to a certain area of their owners ' body			0
@entity8 , mother to @entity115 , 26 , @entity116 , 24 , @entity117 , 21 , and @entity118 , 14 , said : ' i think a lot of people would probably just push a dog away if it started clawing at their chest , but dog owners should take notice , because @entity12 really did save my life			2
' she faces 18 weeks of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiotherapy to ensure the cancer does not return , but her prognosis is good .			2

@entity133 , 46 , from @entity17 ' dog *scratched* at her breast
diagnosed with an aggressive form of stage three breast cancer
the usually timid border collie 's *behaviour* was out of character
