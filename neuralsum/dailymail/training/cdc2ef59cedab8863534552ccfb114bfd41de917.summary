@entity0 and @entity1 are on a collision course as the row over the future of the eurozone and the @entity0 's @entity7 membership intensified			1
chancellor @entity8 has given the biggest hint yet there may be a referendum , and to her clear anger , @entity12 told @entity15 last night @entity0 will not join her proposed @entity17 superstate			1
during yesterday 's @entity20 crisis talks the prime minister openly rejected the @entity1 chancellor 's plan to save the eurozone from oblivion by forming a single @entity26 - country , calling the idea ' nonsense '			1
but in return mr @entity12 was publicly mocked by mrs @entity15 for being ' impatient ' and telling her to put @entity1 cash behind an ‘ immediate ’ rescue plan for the euro or start planning for the break - up of the single currency			1
row : @entity12 and @entity15 have got involved in a war of words over the future of the eurozone as they met in @entity20 yesterday in a clear snub to the pm she said last night : ' it is human to think the euro crisis could be solved in one fell swoop - but i do n't think this would work			1
' the euro crisis developed over ten years and it is going to take several years before we can repair the system and make it viable again			2
with everybody getting so impatient here it is a good job that i am one of the people staying patient			2
' mr @entity12 has repeatedly clashed with the @entity1 chancellor on the future of @entity17 as she outlined plans for what she called ‘ more @entity17 ’ - a euro - superstate in all but name			0
they were discussing the crisis that has left @entity62 banks teetering on the edge of collapse and @entity65 bankrupt , but it appears the two powers are still far apart on a solution			0
@entity0 is backing @entity69 plans for a common ‘ banking union ’ across the eurozone but mr @entity12 has demanded ‘ safeguards ’ for @entity0 and pledged that no @entity0 money would be spent on propping up these institutions			1
warm greeting : @entity12 met his @entity1 counterpart @entity15 with a warm kiss but their talks appear to have left them far apart sit down : mrs @entity15 wants a @entity17 superstate but mr @entity12 has called the idea ' nonsense ' making the point : the pair have clear views and although they both want to save the eurozone both appear to be suspicious of their own country 's plans he even threatened to use the veto to ensure no @entity0 taxpayers ' money is used to foot the bill			1
‘ i can sense why some eurozone countries want to look at elements of banking union			0
but because we are not in the single currency , we wo n’t take part in profound elements of that banking union , ' he said			0
‘ i would n’t ask @entity0 taxpayers to stand behind the @entity65 or @entity62 deposits			2
it ’s not our currency , so it would be inappropriate to do that			0
‘ i will make sure that @entity0 ’s interests , particularly in the single market and the operation of fairness in the single market , are protected			2
that is the key for @entity0			2
’ however , mrs @entity15 has demanded full ‘ political union ’ in the eurozone and said @entity1 would not be stopped by countries such as @entity0 dragging their feet			1
stage - managed stroll : the trio of @entity124 pm @entity123 , @entity15 and @entity12 come over all @entity125 on the roof of the @entity127 yesterday posing for the cameras : the trio look awkward ahead of crucial talks ‘ we need more @entity17 , a budget union and we need a political union first and foremost , ’ she said			1
‘ we must , step by step , cede responsibilities to @entity17			0
we must not remain immobile because one country or another does not want to follow yet			0
’ before their talks , mr @entity12 and mrs @entity15 answered questions from students at a town hall event at the @entity143 in @entity20			1
mr @entity12 once again voiced his strong opposition to a @entity17 - wide financial transactions tax , which he said would simply drive jobs and growth away from the continent			0
@entity0 's financial services industry was already ' making a proper contribution ' to helping get the national deficit under control , through taxes such as the banking levy , the prime minister said			1
but he recognised that the mistakes made by banks in the run - up to the crash of 2008/09 had fuelled the anger seen in the movement to occupy areas of the @entity163 with tent cities			0
' i think a lot of the anger was with irresponsibility in the banking industry and the financial industry and i think people were right to be angry because banks had made bad decisions and had to be bailed out by the taxpayer , and many of the taxpayers were earning much , much less than the people who made the bad decisions in the banks , ' he added			0
' people were angry about that			0
but anger is not a policy			0
' we need to work out what do we do , how do we regulate these organisations properly			0
' we think we have responded properly to the anger			0
' meanwhile @entity8 yesterday gave the government ’s strongest hint yet that a referendum is likely on @entity0 ’s place in @entity17 – but stopped short of promising one			1
poll : @entity8 is the first cabinet member to hint at an @entity7 referendum but would not promise one the chancellor became the first senior member of the @entity194 to suggest that a nationwide vote would be necessary to redraw the @entity0 ’s relationship with @entity197 if the euro crisis leads to greater integration between eurozone nations			1
mr @entity8 pointedly referred to the government ’s new law that would trigger a referendum if powers are passed to the @entity7 as ‘ one of the most significant things this government has done ’			2
crucially , he suggested that the new @entity17 likely to emerge from the wreckage of the single currency will indeed mean powers passing to @entity197			2
so far ministers from @entity12 down have stressed that a referendum is not necessary because changes that affect only the eurozone do not involve powers being ceded to @entity197 from the @entity0			1
but mr @entity8 suggested the fundamental change in the nature of the @entity7 , with eurozone countries effectively merging their fiscal policies and potentially their bank deposits , is such a fundamental change that the @entity0 public should have their say			1
‘ a reshaped relationship with @entity17 would imply , would involve , a transfer of sovereignty or powers to @entity197 , ’ he said			2
‘ we have a very clear safeguard in the system now , thanks to this government , which is , if there is any transfer of power from this country			0
transfer of competence or transfer of sovereignty from this country to the @entity7			0
then there will be a referendum			0
’ and calls for a straight in - out poll are growing from the @entity247 and now the @entity248			0
former @entity250 foreign secretary has said @entity0 has the perfect opportunity to break from the ' shackles ' imposed by @entity197 as members like @entity1 close ranks to form a ' single country called @entity17 '			1
the electorate must be asked two simple questions , would the @entity0 be better off leaving the @entity7 , or staying and joining the euro , he said			2
' a referendum on the future of @entity17 is inevitable at some point between 2013 and 2016 at the latest , ' he wrote in @entity261			0
@entity0 's foreign secretary from 1977 - 79 said the @entity0 would be better off cutting links with @entity197 to join a wider single market to include @entity266 members like @entity267 and @entity268 , which he calls the ' @entity271 '			1
' this has to happen because @entity0 's vision for an @entity7 of no further integration and @entity1 's wish for near - complete integration are incompatible			1

@entity15 mocks @entity278 by calling him ' impatient ' for wanting a quick resolution to the eurozone crisis
the pair held talks yesterday but appear miles apart after fresh war of words last night
meanwhile @entity8 says there could be a referendum if @entity0 's links to @entity197 are changed in any way
