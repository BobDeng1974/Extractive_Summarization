it is located on the left side of the upper abdomen behind the rib cage and acts as a filter for your blood , cleansing it of bacteria , viruses and other debris			1
when blood flows through your spleen , white blood cells attack and remove any foreign invaders			2
this keeps your blood clean and helps protect against infection			2
red blood cells have a lifespan of around 120 days , after which your spleen breaks them down			2
the red blood cell remains are transported elsewhere in your body where they are excreted or recycled			0
foetuses produce red and white blood cells in their spleens			2
shortly before birth the spleen loses its ability to make red blood cells and bone marrow takes over			2
it is possible to live without a spleen as most of its functions can be taken over by other organs			0
however , people without spleens are more vulnerable to infection .			0
