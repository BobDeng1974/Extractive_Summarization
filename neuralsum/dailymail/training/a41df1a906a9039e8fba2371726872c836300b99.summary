demands : sir @entity1 says there is a need to improve plastic surgery patients ' safety beauty therapists , hairdressers and doctors will have to undergo special training before injecting women with dermal fillers , the medical director of the @entity7 is expected to announce			1
sir @entity1 , who is leading a government review of the booming plastic surgery industry , said that a lack of expertise means patients having the popular non-surgical treatments are exposed to ‘ unreasonable risks ’			1
unlike @entity22 , which smooths out lines by paralysing muscles , fillers plump up the skin , fill in wrinkles and crow ’s feet and create younger - looking cheeks and lips			1
once the preserve of the rich and famous , they have soared in popularity as prices have dropped			0
however , there is growing concern that those who inject the substances lack the knowledge and skill to do it properly			1
as a result , patients , who are mainly female , are suffering complications from swelling and bruising to blindness , with knock - on financial and psychological effects			2
the @entity46 reported the case of a bride whose wedding was ruined after the facial fillers she paid for to look perfect for her big day left her with serious nerve damage , blurred vision , insomnia and depression			2
a survey of plastic surgeons last year found that up to 70 per cent have been sought out by patients with complications caused by fillers – almost three times the figure three years previously			1
many of professionals who inject them will have undergone only a few hours of training , which could be as basic as watching a demonstration before practising on a friend			2
sir @entity1 , who is due to publish his review of the cosmetic surgery industry as a whole later this month , said there was a ‘ clear need ’ to improve patient safety			1
this could take the form of a new law which would require everyone administering the treatments to have formal qualifications			2
sir @entity1 said : ‘ i am concerned that some practitioners who are giving non-surgical treatments may not have had any appropriate training whatsoever			1
‘ this leaves people exposed to unreasonable risks , and possibly permanent damage			1
and our research has shown that the public expect procedures that are so widely available to be safe whereas they are largely unregulated			0
danger : the fact that doctors , hairdressers and beauty therapists are not required to undergo proper training is exposing their mainly female patients to ' unreasonable risks ' ‘ there is a clear need for better quality , recognised training for the people performing these operations			1
‘ my review will make a number of recommendations for making sure people who choose to undergo these procedures are in safe hands			2
’ the @entity110 is drafting its own guidelines but these are at an earlier stage			0
the @entity113 gave sir @entity1 ’s comments a cautious welcome			1
it agrees more training is needed but wants the treatments to be administered solely by medical professionals , capable of spotting and treating any resulting health or psychological problems			1
the crackdown on the industry , which will cover everything from breast implants to @entity22 , is also likely to include banning cut - price deals and the introduction of a staged process of consent to give patients time to reflect on their decision			1
victim : @entity133 was left with permanent scars after a busted filler procedure @entity133 could n’t bear to look in the mirror after she had a facial filler treatment that went horribly wrong			0
miss @entity133 , 58 , paid for injections to plump up her cheeks			0
at first , she was pleased with the results			0
but the filler quickly splintered into tiny pieces and complications set in			0
miss @entity133 , a mother of three from central @entity144 , developed visible , hard lumps in her left cheek and under her right eye and severe swelling			0
she said : ‘ i became very scared as the lumps got worse			0
' i had always been proud of my physical appearance but could n’t bear to look at myself in the mirror			0
’ corrective surgery five years later , in 2010 , removed some but not all of the fragments of filler and she has been left scarred			2
last night , miss @entity133 said that better training for those giving the jabs is not the only answer to ensuring such procedures are safe			0
she said the government needs to do more to ensure the safety of the substances themselves			0
the retired beauty clinic worker said : ‘ the government is taking the easy option			0

lack of expertise and regulations pose ' unreasonable risks ' to patients
