there will come a point on sunday when those on @entity3 will look out and see a dream from bygone days has become reality			2
@entity6 will take possession from @entity8 and look up to see @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 spinning off defenders , desperate for his pass			1
how potent would @entity14 have been had those five men lined up in their prime ? unique circumstances will allow fantasy to become reality for 90 minutes but it will be @entity14 the city , rather than the team , that feels the benefit as @entity23 stages an all - star match that has created enormous interest , for many reasons			2
@entity27 striker @entity9 ( centre ) is excited to be returning to @entity23 for the all - star game @entity30 could feature up top alongside his friend @entity10 who left the club for @entity34 in the summer how will @entity9 be received four years after his £ 50million move to @entity35 ? what kind of reception will @entity37 captain @entity36 be afforded ? how much will @entity10 ’s return stir the locals ’ senses of what they have been missing ? @entity6 will captain his side against a team selected by his friend and former vice-captain @entity48 and the proceeds from the match , which sold out in hours , will go to a number of charities in @entity14 , as well as @entity53			1
the idea came about after @entity6 approached @entity14 and raised the prospect of staging a match to say “ thank you ” to the club and the city before he embarks on a new challenge with @entity62			1
@entity6 will captain his side against a team selected by former vice-captain @entity48 @entity8 has also confirmed that he will be a part of the novelty all - star game for friend @entity6 ‘ it 's going to be a great occasion , ’ @entity6 said			1
‘ when i made the calls and told the players they would play in front of a full house at @entity23 , they loved the idea			2
@entity48 and i should n’t get any credit : it 's credit to everyone who wants to come and help out			0
‘ i know all those who are involved			0
they are winners and it will be a great game			0
@entity36 could easily have said “ no ” but it shows the type of guy he is			0
’ @entity48 added : ‘ when i spoke to @entity11 , he was more excited than i was ! it will be great for some of the former players who left @entity14 to have the chance to come back and say a proper goodbye			0
