by @entity0 astronomers using the @entity2 have seen a horrifying glimpse of the destructive power of solar flares , as a huge x-ray flare ' boiled off ' the atmosphere of a distant planet			1
our own sun 's flares are usually only powerful enough to disrupt radio communications on @entity13 , but a new sunspot group - @entity14 1520 - is one of the biggest in years , and may bombard @entity13 next week			1
just after a violent flare on its parent star bathed it in intense x-ray radiation , the planet @entity17 's atmosphere gave off a powerful burst of evaporation			1
@entity2 found that the planet 's upper atmosphere was streaming away at speeds exceeding 300,000 mph			1
just before the @entity2 observation , @entity29 's @entity28 detected the star blasting out a strong x-ray flare , one powerful enough to blow away part of the planet 's atmosphere boiled off into space : this @entity29 image shows an artist 's rendering which illustrates the evaporation of @entity17 's atmosphere in response to a powerful eruption from its host star flares from our own sun : this @entity29 image , from july 11 shows gigantic sunspot @entity14			1
one of the biggest sunspots in years , @entity47 , is turning toward @entity13 and harbors energy for strong solar flares astronomer @entity51 and his team used @entity2 to observe the atmosphere of exoplanet hd 189733b during two periods in early 2010 and late 2011 , as it was silhouetted against its parent star			1
while backlit in this way , the planet 's atmosphere imprints its chemical signature on the starlight , allowing astronomers to decode what is happening on scales that are too tiny to image directly			0
the observations were carried out in order to confirm what the team had previously seen once before in a different planetary system : the evaporation of an exoplanet 's atmosphere			0
hd 189733b has a blue sky , but that 's where the similarities with @entity13 stop			0
the planet is a huge gas giant similar to @entity82 , but it lies extremely close to its star , just one thirtieth the distance @entity13 is from the @entity84 even though its star is slightly smaller and cooler than the @entity84 , this makes the planet 's climate exceptionally hot , at above 1000 degrees @entity88 , and the upper atmosphere is battered by energetic extreme - ultraviolet and x-ray radiation			1
as such , it is an excellent candidate to study the effects of a star on a planetary atmosphere			0
' the first set of observations were actually disappointing , ' @entity96 said , ' since they showed no trace of the planet 's atmosphere at all			0
we only realised we had chanced upon something more interesting when the second set of observations came in			0
' the team 's follow - up observations , made in 2011 , showed a dramatic change , with clear signs of a plume of gas being blown from the planet at a rate of at least 1000 tonnes per second			0
@entity96 added : ' we had n't just confirmed that some planets ' atmospheres evaporate - we had watched the physical conditions in the evaporating atmosphere vary over time			2
nobody had done that before			0
' bright spark : in this @entity123 simulation , the sun flares up as planet hd 189733b transits past the solar flare left the sun as the planet passed in front of it , from the perspective of @entity13 's satellites despite the extreme temperature of the planet , the atmosphere is not hot enough to evaporate at the rate seen in 2011			1
instead the evaporation is thought to be driven by the intense x-ray and extreme - ultraviolet radiation from the parent star , @entity139 , which is about 20 times more powerful than that of our own @entity84 taking into account also that hd 189733b is a giant planet very close to its star , then it must suffer an x-ray dose three million times higher than the @entity13			2
evidence to support x-ray driven evaporation comes from simultaneous observations of @entity139 with the @entity28 satellite , which , unlike @entity2 , can observe the star 's atmosphere - frying x-rays			1
a few hours before @entity2 observed the planet for the second time , @entity28 recorded a powerful flash of radiation coming from the surface of the star , in which the star briefly became 4 times brighter in x-rays			0
co-author @entity164 , from the @entity165 , said : ' x-ray emissions are a small part of the star 's total output , but it is the part that it is energetic enough to drive the evaporation of the atmosphere			2
' this was the brightest x-ray flare from @entity139 of several observed to date , and it seems very likely that the impact of this flare on the planet drove the evaporation seen a few hours later with @entity2			1
' x-rays are energetic enough to heat the gas in the upper atmosphere to tens of thousands of degrees , hot enough to escape the gravitational pull of the giant planet			2
a similar process occurs , albeit less dramatically , when a space weather event such as a solar flare hits the @entity13 's ionosphere , disrupting communications			2
while the team believes that the flash of x-rays is the most likely cause of the atmospheric changes they saw on @entity17 , there are other possible explanations			0
for example , it may be that the baseline level of x-ray emission from the star increased between 2010 and 2011 , in a seasonal process similar to the @entity84 's 11 - year sunspot cycle			2
regardless of the details of exactly what happened to @entity17 's atmosphere , which the team hope to clarify using future observations with @entity2 and @entity123 's @entity213 x-ray space telescope , there is no question that the planet was hit by a stellar flare , and no question that the rate of evaporation of the planet 's atmosphere shot up			1
this research has relevance not only for the study of @entity82 - like planets			0
several recent discoveries of rocky ' super earths ' near their parent stars are thought to be the remnants of planets like @entity17 , after the complete evaporation of their atmospheres .			0

huge x-ray flare ' blasts ' atmosphere off into space at @entity239
@entity242 's upper atmosphere ' boiled off ' by flare
@entity29 says new sunspot group on @entity246 - is biggest for some time
strong chance of powerful solar flares over next few days
