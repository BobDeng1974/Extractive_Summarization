@entity1 captain @entity0 has insisted he has no reason to fear being banned for sunday ’s @entity3 and called on critics of his @entity5 tackle on @entity7 to ‘ man up ’			1
the @entity10 skipper , whose heavy challenge on the @entity13 striker sparked a melee during a stormy @entity16 quarter - final at the weekend , is one of a number of players who will find out on tuesday if they face retrospective action from the @entity21			1
but , dismissing any concern , @entity0 said : ‘ am i worried about being cited ? not in the slightest			1
the referee was two yards away and he had a clear view of my tackle and he saw that i won the ball			2
@entity1 's @entity0 has accused @entity13 forward @entity7 of ' blatantly ' kicking him in the head ‘ it was a great tackle			1
he was fine with it and so was the linesman			2
they saw what they saw and they made their decisions			2
‘ at the end of the day , it ’s a man ’s sport			0
people need to man up a bit			0
people moan about the tackles , but if the ball is there to be won , go and win it			0
as long as it ’s not dangerous and you are not flying two - footed into somebody			2
’ in the wake of an absorbing 1 - 1 draw game that saw three red cards and two penalties , one of which was saved , the @entity5 club announced they are appealing the red card issued to midfielder @entity59			1
the luckless @entity59 was the victim of mistaken identity by referee @entity61 , at the behest of assistant referee @entity63 , after his team - mate @entity64 clashed on the ground with @entity1 ’s @entity66			1
but while @entity59 ’s appeal on thursday is expected to be straightforward , @entity67 faces a 48 hours cup final sweat after @entity1 also appealed his red card			1
@entity0 holds his head during the bad - tempered @entity16 quarter - final on sunday afternoon and in what is shaping up as a disciplinary @entity76 , @entity13 trio @entity73 , @entity64 and @entity74 will join @entity0 in finding out by 3pm this afternoon whether they face retrospective disciplinary action from @entity21 compliance officer @entity79			1
@entity7 appeared to kick @entity0 in the face following the @entity1 man ’s heavy challenge , while @entity64 could be hit with a red card for his role in the clash with @entity66			1
@entity74 , meanwhile , could face a simulation charge after @entity1 boss @entity87 accused him of diving to win his team ’s first half penalty kick , scored by @entity7			1
@entity91 was the other sending off during sunday ’s match but @entity13 wo n’t contest that and he misses the @entity16 replay at @entity10 on march 18			1
after the cup match , @entity13 boss @entity96 said much of the trouble could have been avoided if referee @entity61 had sent off @entity0 for his initial challenge on @entity7			1
the referee did not even give a foul but the @entity1 captain – who called for video evidence to be introduced to help the under - fire match officials – added : ‘ i was kicked in the head ( by @entity7 )			1
you can blatantly see that			0
we will see what happens with that			0
at the time i did n’t know who it was			0
i felt a boot against my face			2
‘ there was so much going on at the time , i did n’t know who it was until i watched it again afterwards			0
‘ i ’m probably lucky it was to my face , and not another part of my body			2
@entity124 wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw with @entity13 @entity1 defender @entity66 ( right ) was sent off after only nine minutes of the @entity16 quarter - final in a case of mistaken identity , the referee also sent off @entity13 's @entity59 ‘ do i hope @entity66 wins his appeal ? that would be great but we will see			1
but i did n’t see that incident because i had ( @entity7 ’s ) studs in my face at the time			2
you could see the marks , you still can			0
’ @entity0 , who was speaking at @entity138 where he was publicising sunday ’s showpiece occasion , also backed up his boss @entity87 ’s assertion that @entity74 had been guilty of simulation to win a penalty			1
‘ it was a blatant dive , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i was close by			0
@entity144 ( @entity145 ) put his leg in but you can see that he has pulled his leg away before the lad has gone down			0
‘ he played it really well			0
i will give him that but we had ( @entity153 ) get a two - match ban for that so i think it was dealt with rightly			2
you do n’t want to see people cheating whether it helps you or not			0
it is not a nice part of the game			0
’ @entity0 refused to be critical of match officials @entity61 and @entity163 , and instead insisted video evidence would have cleared up the confusion			2
‘ i think yesterday would have been ideal for it , ’ he said			0
‘ we stopped the game for four or five minutes and it was the wrong decision that @entity59 got sent off			0
‘ if we had watched that back we would have clearly seen who it was			0
‘ it would n’t stop the game every two minutes , ( only with ) big decisions like that			0

@entity13 and @entity1 drew 1 - 1 at @entity5 on sunday
three players were sent off in the bad - tempered @entity16 clash
@entity1 captain @entity0 could face retrospective action from the @entity21
