a solar - powered family car has completed a drive from @entity2 to @entity3 fuelled entirely by sunshine - a journey covering almost 385 miles ( 619km )			1
called @entity7 , the vehicle can travel up to 500 miles ( 800 km ) on a single charge , clocking speeds of up to 80mph ( 130 km )			1
the prototype four - seater has solar cells on its roof to provide power while driving , and it boasts a tablet that tracks traffic lights			1
a lightweight , wedge - shaped electric car called @entity7 ( shown ) that charges itself with solar cells on its roof has been built at @entity17			1
it travels 500 miles ( 800km ) on a single charge at speeds of 80mph ( 130km/h )			1
this distance is increased if the sun is shining thanks to the array of solar panels on top the vehicle was created by a group called @entity29 , based at @entity17 in the @entity30			1
@entity7 's recent journey took it up @entity34 's scenic @entity33 into the centre of @entity2 @entity7 can travel up to 500 miles ( 800 km ) on a single charge , at speeds of 80mph ( 130 km )			1
the 1.5 - kilowatt solar panels on top of the car , which cost about £ 2,600 ( $ 4,260 ) to produce , supply power to the car 's lithium ion battery at the back of the car , the panels can be lifted up to reveal a boot , and other novelties include a steering wheel that expands when a user drives too fast , and contracts when they drive too slow			1
it weighs 855lbs ( 390kg ) and is 15ft ( 4.6 metres ) long , while the body of the vehicle is made of carbon fibre			0
its aerodynamic shape also helps to increase its driving range			0
but the car is less than 4ft ( 1.2 metres ) tall , so getting in is a bit of a squeeze			0
@entity7 can even communicate with other cars ; during an example , it relayed traffic information to a @entity64 nearby			2
and this extends to traffic lights as well - a tablet screen in the car will tell the driver how long until a light up ahead turns red or green			1
and the creators of @entity7 hope their vehicle might one day enter mass production , and become a common sight on roads			2

but it is less than 4ft ( 1.2 metres ) tall , so getting in is a bit of a squeeze ' it was great to see all the people looking at us ; hurrying to get their smartphones out to get pictures while we were driving , ' said @entity143 , manager of @entity144 after the car had undertaken its drive from @entity2 to @entity3			1
in july a team of @entity149 students broke a 26 - year - old world record for speed , which would make their solar car the fastest electric vehicle to travel 500km on a single battery charge			1
the car , which was built by @entity157 's top solar car racing team - @entity149 's @entity158 - was able to travel at an average speed of more than 100km/h , beating the previous world record of 73km/h			2
the world record was broken on a 2.6 miles ( 4.2km ) circular race track in @entity163 - south - west of @entity164 - in @entity165 at the @entity166			0
the vehicle to smash the record , @entity169 , was the fifth one built and raced by @entity158 since the team was founded in 1996			0
' i think we caused some traffic jams and we were worried some drivers might run into us while trying to take pictures			0
' @entity143 is one of the students at @entity17 who designed and built @entity7 in what grew into a school - wide project that won a @entity182 challenge race across @entity157 in 2013			1
@entity7 launched a @entity184 tour in @entity185 at the @entity186 in early september			0
the team drove to @entity3 to join sponsor @entity188 of @entity30 in an event focused on a future in which roads are made safer and air pollution reduced by cars that ' talk ' to one another as well as traffic signals			2
' we think it is possible to make these cars and have them in a showroom in five to 10 years , but it is a big dream and something we have to really work on , ' said @entity143			0
the technology in @entity7 is not new and if the solar cars were mass - produced like gas - guzzling models they could be similarly affordable , according to the student			2
but big auto - makers have had little contact with the team because ' they think it is too far - fetched , ' @entity143 told @entity210			0
' we think otherwise , of course , ' he said			0
' it is the first family car that is powered by solar energy , it just does n't have a family yet			0
' @entity7 also has a steering wheel ( pictured ) that expands if a users drive too fast , and or contracts if they go too slow			1
the car is a prototype at the moment but recently completed a drive from @entity2 to @entity3 the body of the vehicle is made of carbon fibre			1

the lightweight , wedge - shaped electric car charges itself with solar cells
it was built at @entity17 in @entity234
it travels 500 miles ( 800km ) on a single charge at speeds of @entity239 ( 130km/h )
this distance is increased if the sun is shining thanks to panels on the roof
car also features a tablet that shows driver when traffic lights will change
and @entity7 's steering wheel expands if you drive too fast
@entity7 is a prototype , but recently drove from @entity2 to @entity3
