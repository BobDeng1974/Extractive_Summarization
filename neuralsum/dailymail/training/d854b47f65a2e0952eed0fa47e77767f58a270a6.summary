by @entity0 published : 21:02 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 20 february 2013 we spend our working lives looking forward to an old age in which we can happily indulge in holidays and hobbies – but now it seems the typical nest egg put aside will vanish just seven years after retirement			1
the result is that average @entity11 will have to contend without any savings at all for the final 12 years of life , a report warns today			1
and the research by @entity15 revealed that people in the @entity17 are less prepared for retirement that any of 14 other countries which took part in the poll			1
few years of fun : most people in the @entity17 only save enough money for their first seven years of retirement the average @entity11 wants to retire ‘ punctually ’ at 65 and believes they would need about £ 22,500 a year to live comfortably			1
this could come from state pension , company pension , income from savings and dividends from investments			0
but the report warns that savings will typically run out after seven years			2
for those retiring at 65 , their nest egg will have shrunk to zero by the age of 72			0
however , average life expectancy is 84 – leaving 12 years after the nest egg is gone			2
but for many the gap will be even longer			0
the most common age of death in @entity46 and @entity47 is 85 for men and 89 for women , according to the @entity50			0
it means the typical man will be left to survive without any savings for 13 years – and the typical woman for 17 years			2
no gold in silver years : britons do not save enough money for their retirement , a survey has found when asked how they would like to spend their retirement , common answers were ‘ frequent ’ holidays , home improvements and learning new hobbies			1
but a desperate lack of cash is likely to sabotage such plans for those who are left with just the income from their pension			0
yet few of working age are prepared to make the necessary sacrifice for the future			2
just 32 per cent said they would prioritise saving for retirement over taking a holiday if they had to make the choice one year			2
the gap is ‘ the worst identified by the international study ’ , which also looked at @entity80 , the @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 among other countries			0
no cash : the reluctance to save for retirement mean that the average @entity89 will stand with an empty account for their last 12 years in life a typical pensioner around the world will run out of savings far later than in @entity17 – ‘ just over halfway ’ through retirement			1
@entity97 of @entity15 said : ‘ people are putting off the inevitable , which is the reality of significant cuts to their living standards in their twilight years after their savings run out			1
’ last night , pensions minister @entity103 said the report was ‘ a startling reminder of the problems we are facing by failing to save for our retirement ’			0
@entity109 , chief executive of the @entity110 , said : ‘ the @entity17 needs to do more to face up to saving for its old age			1
‘ for millions of people , that will mean working longer or saving more , or both			0
‘ too many people will retire only to find they have to significantly downgrade their lifestyle because they do not have enough savings			0

people in the @entity17 are badly prepared for their retirement , survey finds
@entity17 last in research into how much we plan ahead for our final years
