despite some @entity55 ' boycotting , demand to see the speech is brisk			2
' we ’ve had 10 times the number of requests for tickets than there are seats available in the gallery , ' house speaker @entity56 said monday in an emailed statement			1
' in fact , demand is so overwhelming that both the @entity17 and @entity67 have set up separate viewing locations , which are also ticketed events			0
' each @entity17 member gets a single ticket to give away			0
' i could scalp that ticket , there are so many people who want it , ' @entity73 rep. @entity72 told the @entity78			0
' in fact , demand is so overwhelming that both the @entity17 and @entity67 have set up separate viewing locations , which are also ticketed events			0

@entity85 , wife of @entity1 prime minister @entity0 , attended her husband 's speech at the @entity40 policy conference on monday ' in 1948 , secretary of state @entity89 opposed @entity92 's intention to declare statehood , ' @entity0 recalled			1
' that 's an understatement – he vehemently opposed it			0
but , @entity92 , understanding what was at stake , went ahead and declared @entity1 's independence			2
' ' in 1967 , as an @entity100 noose was tightening around @entity1 's neck , the @entity3 warned ... that if @entity1 acted alone , it would be alone			1
but @entity1 did act – acted alone – to defend itself			2
' ' in 1981 , under the leadership of prime minister @entity105 , @entity1 destroyed a nuclear reactor at @entity107 , ' @entity0 continued			1
' the @entity3 criticized @entity1 and suspended arms - transfers for three months			2
' and in 2002 , after the worst wave of @entity112 terror attacks in @entity1 's history , prime minister @entity109 launched @entity114			1
the @entity3 demanded that @entity1 withdraw its troops immediately but @entity109 continued until the operation was completed			2
' ' i mention them to make a point , ' he said			0
' despite occasional disagreements , the friendship between @entity3 and @entity1 grew stronger and stronger , decade after decade			2
and our friendship will weather the current disagreements as well to grow even stronger in the future			0
' @entity3 @entity34 ambassador @entity33 told @entity40 that the @entity3 will ' never ' allow @entity6 to have a nuclear weapon the alliance between @entity1 and the @entity3 is ' stronger than ever , ' @entity0 finally insisted , quelling fears of a rift between his @entity132 and @entity9 's @entity55			1
he insisted that ' reports of the demise of the @entity3 - @entity1 relation is not just premature ; they are wrong			2
' ' my speech is not intended to show any disrespect to president @entity9 or the office that he holds			0
i have great respect for both , ' he said			0
' i deeply appreciate all the president @entity9 has done for @entity1 : security cooperation , intelligence sharing , support in the @entity34 and much more			2
' ' the last thing anyone who cares about @entity1 , the last thing that i would want , is for @entity1 to become a partisan issue , ' he added , ' and i regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that			0
@entity1 has always been a bipartisan issue			0
@entity1 should always remain a bipartisan issue			0
' @entity0 addressed the gathering monday morning at the @entity159 , bracketed by remarks from two senior @entity3 officials : @entity33 and national security adviser @entity162			1
the @entity9 administration hedged last week about whether it would send someone to speak , and who it might be , after @entity163 raised the subject during a @entity17 briefing			1
@entity33 insisted that ' @entity3 will not allow @entity6 to obtain a nuclear weapon , period			1
' ' talks , no talks , agreement , no agreement , the @entity3 will take whatever steps are necessary to protect our national security and that of our closest allies , ' she said to an audience of thousands			0
' we believe diplomacy is the preferred route to secure our shared aim			0
but if diplomacy fails , we know the stakes of a nuclear - armed @entity6 as well as everyone here			0
we will not let it happen			0
there will never be a sunset on @entity3 's commitment to @entity1 's security			2
' she also criticized @entity0 for ' politicizing ' the @entity6 debate , saying @entity3 - @entity1 relations ' should never be politicized and it can not and will not be tarnished or broken			1
' @entity0 's visit to @entity42 has sparked criticism in both the @entity3 and @entity1			1
the centerpiece of his trip is an address to @entity51 tuesday , which came at the invitation of congressional @entity204 and was not coordinated with the @entity17			1

) sen. @entity265 ( @entity266 ) source : @entity268 @entity269 , deputy director of @entity270 , is helping @entity0 's opponents in the hope of defeating him , even as the @entity17 insists @entity9 wo n't meet with the prime minister in order to avoid the appearance of prejudicing the election neither president @entity9 nor vice president @entity278 will meet with the prime minister while he 's in @entity42 , citing a desire to avoid the appearance of picking a side in @entity1 's upcoming elections			1
a close @entity9 adviser , though , former presidential campaign aide @entity269 , is in @entity1 working to help @entity0 's opposition defeat him			1
@entity286 has been particularly sharp in her criticism of @entity0 's plans to address @entity51 , calling the move ' destructive ' to the fabric of the @entity3 - @entity1 relationship			1

a @entity0 adviser told reporters traveling to @entity42 with the prime minister on sunday that he was not coming to the @entity3 capital to offend @entity9			1
' the prime minister is here to warn , in front of any stage possible , the dangers ' of the agreement that may be taking shape , the adviser said , speaking anonymously under a policy that bars the official from speaking on the record			2

still , he tried to lower tensions by saying that @entity1 ' does not oppose every deal ' and was merely doing its best to warn the @entity3 of the risks entailed in the current one			2
as @entity0 was preparing to speak , secretary of state @entity328 was in @entity329 for another round of talks with @entity6			2
the @entity3 is seeking to secure a framework agreement to curtail @entity6 's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief ahead of a late - march deadline			1
the @entity3 is negotiating alongside @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 and @entity341 .			0

speech at the @entity40 meeting on monday preceded his address to a @entity348
house speaker @entity56 says ' we *'ve* had 10 times the number of requests for tickets than there are seats available in the gallery ' on tuesday
@entity17 sent @entity162 and @entity33 to rebut @entity0
' imagine what @entity6 would do with nuclear weapons , ' @entity0 warned as the @entity3 continues negotiations that could ultimately allow it
he suggested @entity1 might act against @entity6 on its own , listing times when it 's defied the @entity3 to defend itself
