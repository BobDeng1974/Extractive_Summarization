even by his stratospheric standards , this was something very special			0
@entity3 was back to his brilliant , unplayable best as he scored five goals in @entity7 's 9 - 1 rout of @entity8 on sunday , among them an eight - minute hat - trick			1
that treble was @entity3 's 31st career hat - trick and his 24th in @entity12 , equalling @entity14 's record in the competition			0
it also took his formidable goal tally for the @entity20 club to 299 in 287 matches			0
against @entity8 , @entity3 has now scored 11 times in just eight matches			1
but , compared with some , they have got off quite lightly			0
we take a look at the clubs who have suffered the most at the hands of the @entity31 wonder			0
@entity3 scored five goals as @entity7 thrashed @entity8 9 - 1 on sunday afternoon the @entity31 superstar was simply irresistible as @entity7 ran riot at the @entity20 @entity36 - 18 @entity35 in 12 matches there 's no denying it - @entity3 just loves playing against @entity36 , whose defence must be terrified every time they see him			1
three of those @entity12 hat - tricks have come against the team from @entity45 - he scored triples in a 6 - 2 win at the @entity48 in may 2011 , a 4 - 1 success at the @entity20 in february 2013 and a 7 - 3 thrashing in october of the same year			2
but they are n't even @entity3 's best return			0
he scored four goals , including a 12 - minute hat - trick , in another 6 - 2 win in @entity55 back in may 2011			2
most recently , @entity3 scored twice in @entity7 's 2 - 0 @entity56 win over @entity36 in august			1
@entity3 celebrates with @entity57 after scoring in @entity7 's @entity59 win over @entity36 @entity35 in 20 matches @entity7 derbies have been pretty common in recent years - not only in @entity12 but also in the @entity62 ( they 're met in four of the last five seasons ) and , of course , last season 's @entity66 final			1
in the 2011 - 12 league fixtures , @entity3 scored twice against @entity69 at the @entity20 and three times against them at @entity72			1
both matches ended in 4 - 1 wins for @entity7			1
but the most famous was in @entity75 last may , when @entity3 scored @entity7 's fourth in the @entity66 final and ran off for that shirtless celebration			1
@entity3 whips off his shirt to celebrate scoring the fourth goal in @entity7 's 2014 @entity66 final win @entity82 - @entity35 in 26 matches as a @entity85 player , @entity3 failed to score in five meetings with @entity82 but that soon changed when he switched to @entity7 in 2009			1
scored : 417 goals against : 82 clubs he scored an extra-time header to win the @entity62 final of 2011 and claim his first piece of silverware at the @entity20			0
and the @entity96 goals have flowed regularly since - @entity3 has scored seven against @entity82 in the league , five in the @entity62 and three in the @entity98			2
with @entity3 and @entity14 in a never - ending ' anything you can do ' contest , there should be many more to come			0
@entity14 was left scratching his head after @entity3 scored in the @entity96 last october @entity105 - 15 goals in nine matches @entity3 really has it in for @entity105 with an excellent scoring ratio against @entity7 's city rivals			1
he notched hat - tricks against them in both the 2010 - 11 season and the 2012 - 13 campaign and added two more in a 3 - 0 real win when the sides met at the @entity116 back in january			0
i doubt @entity105 are looking forward to their last - day visit to the @entity20 very much ... @entity3 celebrates after scoring against @entity105 at the @entity20 in may 2011 @entity119 in 12 matches another team @entity3 averages better than a goal a game against is @entity125			1
he topped up his impressive record against the @entity127 with a hat - trick in a 5 - 0 home win earlier this season			0
that was the second time he has scored three against them - the other came in a 5 - 1 @entity20 victory in november 2010			2
@entity3 also registered doubles in a 4 - 1 win in january 2012 and a 3 - 0 win at @entity138 in april 2013			1
@entity3 heads home @entity7 's second goal against @entity125 in a @entity12 meeting in september 2013 @entity142 in 13 matches @entity3 has @entity144 in the crosshairs too , averaging a goal a game in his 13 encounters with them			1
he has scored two hat - tricks against them , in a 7 - 0 demolition at the @entity20 in march 2011 and a 4 - 0 success at @entity154 in october the same year			0
it almost came as a surprise when @entity3 failed to find the net against them back in november - but he did contribute two assists instead			0
ronaldo wheels away in celebration after scoring against @entity144 back in january 2010 @entity162 - 12 goals in six matches @entity3 's best scoring ratio is against @entity162 where he has an incredible average of two goals a game			1
admittedly , there have only been six games since @entity162 returned to the top flight but nearly all of them have been messy			0
@entity3 scored a hat - trick in a 3 - 0 home win earlier this season and he also scored three in a @entity62 tie in january 2013			1
indeed , @entity3 has scored every time he 's faced them			2
ronaldo averages two goals a game against @entity162 - including this one in december 2014 @entity183 - 12 goals in 11 matches @entity183 have also served as target practice for @entity3 too over the years , with the goals coming at regular intervals			1
earlier this season , @entity3 helped himself to two as @entity7 routed them 5 - 0 at the @entity190			2
a @entity62 tie in december 2010 saw @entity3 score three of @entity7 's eight strikes			2
on target for @entity7 in an away @entity12 match with @entity183 back in november 2012 @entity196 - 11 goals in 13 matches after drawing a blank four times against @entity196 with @entity85 , @entity3 has well and truly made up for lost time			1
he has scored 11 times in nine @entity12 encounters , including a hat - trick in a 4 - 2 home win in january 2011 ( plus an assist for good measure )			0
@entity3 extended his scoring streak against the @entity207 this season , netting both home and away			0
a high - five for @entity210 after scoring against @entity196 earlier this season			0
the game ended 2 - 2 @entity213 in eight matches @entity3 sliced through the @entity8 defence on sunday like a knife through butter , registering the first five - goal haul of his career			2
he also took his impressive tally against this particular opponent to 11 goals in eight outings			0
@entity3 points to the heavens after scoring for @entity7 against @entity8 last season ronaldo against the @entity227 teams @entity3 's prolific scoring record against the @entity230 clubs means you have to go down to no 16 on the overall list to find the @entity234 opponent he has scored most against			1
it 's @entity236 - @entity3 scored nine times in 14 matches against them during his time with @entity85			1
he also has eight in 16 meetings with @entity242			0
but how about the leading teams in @entity227 ? @entity245 - six goals in 15 matches @entity3 mustered half a dozen goals for @entity85 against the @entity248 during his six seasons at @entity250			2
the most significant were the two at the @entity252 to deliver @entity85 into the @entity254 final , while he also scored twice in a 4 - 2 success at @entity256 in february 2005			0
@entity3 celebrates his stunning free - kick for @entity85 in the @entity66 semi with @entity245 @entity260 goals in 13 matches @entity3 scored four times in @entity264 derbies during his time at @entity250 - and also found the target against @entity267 for @entity7 in a 2012 @entity66 tie			1
his most telling contribution was a penalty at the @entity271 in may 2007 as @entity85 beat their rivals 1 - 0 en route to the @entity234 title			0
a youthful @entity3 scored twice as @entity85 beat @entity267 4 - 2 in an @entity276 tie in february 2004 @entity278 - three goals in 11 matches @entity3 has struggled for goals against @entity278 - scoring twice against them for @entity85 and then adding another in @entity7 's 3 - 0 win at @entity283 earlier this season			1
that was his first time scoring at @entity283 as the other two came at @entity250 in contrasting circumstances - a 3 - 0 win in march 2008 and a 4 - 1 loss in march 2009			0
@entity3 draws the ire of the @entity283 crowd after scoring there for @entity7 earlier this season @entity85 - two goals in two matches @entity3 came back to haunt sir @entity295 and @entity85 by scoring in both legs of their 2013 @entity66 last - 16 tie			2
his header cancelled out @entity300 's opener in the @entity20 and he then scored the decisive goal at @entity250 - refusing to celebrate - after @entity302 had been sent off for @entity85			0
@entity3 refused to celebrate after scoring the goal that knocked @entity85 out of @entity304 in 2013 @entity306 - one goal in 15 matches @entity3 's record against @entity306 is poor - having found the net just once against the @entity311 side in 15 appearances			2
mind you , it was an incredibly important one , a header in the 2008 @entity66 final as @entity85 claimed their third @entity66 triumph			0
ronaldo towers above the @entity306 defence to head home during the 2008 @entity66 final 18 - @entity36 15 - @entity321 , @entity82 , @entity105 14 - @entity125 13 - malaga 12 - @entity162 , @entity183 11 - @entity196 , @entity8 10 - @entity322 9 - @entity236 , @entity190 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 8 - @entity242 7 - @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 6 - @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity245 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 5 - @entity339 , @entity267 , @entity340 , @entity341 4 - @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 3 - @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity278 , @entity358 2 - @entity359 , @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity85 , @entity372 1 - @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 , @entity380 , @entity381 , @entity382 , @entity383 , @entity306 , @entity384 , @entity385			1

@entity3 scored five times in @entity7 's 9 - 1 win over @entity8
it takes his total to 11 goals in eight matches against them
but @entity8 have got off lightly compared to some teams he has faced
@entity3 has 18 goals in 12 against @entity36 ; 15 in 20 versus @entity321
@entity31 has 15 goals in nine against @entity105 and 12 in six vs @entity162
