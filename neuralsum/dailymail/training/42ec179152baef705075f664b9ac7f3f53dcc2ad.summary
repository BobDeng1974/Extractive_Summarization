by @entity0 published : 13:21 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 14:12 est , 28 january 2013 a grandmother who fraudulently tried to claim £ 740,000 after tripping in the street now faces charges for contempt of court			2
@entity6 - born @entity5 , 59 , sued @entity7 in @entity8 after the incident in may 2008			1
she claimed the injury to her right knee was so severe she could only move around her home in @entity7 , @entity8 , by ' sliding on my buttocks '			2
mother - of - 13 @entity5 tried to sue @entity7 in @entity8 , pictured , after she trip on an uneven paving stone outside her house and injured her knee but video evidence contradicted her case and her claim was struck out at a county court last year after a judge found the mother - of - 13 had grossly exaggerated her injury			1
now a high court judge has agreed that homes for @entity7 , which runs @entity7 housing stock and maintains the pavement outside her home , can prosecute mrs @entity5 for contempt of court			1
her husband , @entity32 , who gave evidence to back her false claim , will also be prosecuted			0
they both face a jail sentence if convicted			0
a statement released by @entity26 for @entity7 's legal team revealed one of their lawyers had won permission from mr @entity43 to pursue contempt proceedings against the couple			0
it said ms @entity5 's case was the first of its kind since a landmark ruling in june last year made it possible to take action over alleged fraudulent exaggeration in personal injury cases			1
the statement added : ' the application will proceed to a final hearing later in the year			0
' it is understood that prosecutions of this kind are intended to counter the ' compensation culture ' to deter people from exaggerating their claim			0
court case : the @entity65 county court threw out ms @entity5 's claim - deciding she had grossly exaggerated her injury mr @entity43 said that the case was prompted by surveillance videos which showed ms @entity5 ' using stairs without assistance ' and ' carrying her shopping bags without difficulty '			1
this was an ' extraordinary divergence from the picture painted ' by ms @entity5 and her husband , he said			0
they had claimed that she needed care for 10 to 16 hours a day , was only able to climb stairs by ' shuffling on her buttocks ' , and was no longer able to care for her children and grandchildren			0
the judge said that , although ms @entity5 and her husband claimed previous publicity of her case had caused her ' embarrassment ' , there was a ' strong public interest in pursuing false claims ' and that a contempt prosecution was justified			1
last october , judge @entity90 at @entity65 county court struck out her compensation claim altogether after deciding ms @entity5 , who has 14 grandchildren , had grossly exaggerated her case			1
@entity7 had admitted liability , but the issue went to trial after ms @entity5 rejected their initial offer of a £ 7,500 settlement			2
the judge reached his decision in october after video evidence found that ms @entity5 had a pre-existing deformity in her right knee and that she had exaggerated the extent of her injuries received in the fall			2
judge @entity90 said the injury would have resulted in two to three months of discomfort and was worth no more than £ 1,500			0
@entity110 , from @entity26 for @entity7 , welcomed the decision			0
she said : ' ms @entity5 grossly exaggerated the extent of her injuries			1

@entity5 made the claim after tripping on an uneven paving stone in 2008
case thrown out after the mother - of - 13 ' grossly exaggerated ' her injury
homes for @entity7 can now bring prosecution against mrs @entity5
