@entity10 , the leader of the main opposition party , the @entity11 , wants to do away with the ancient concept of ' jus soli ' , or ' right of the soil '			1
it means that a child born in @entity4 to @entity19 parents can acquire citizenship at birth if at least one parent was born in @entity4			2
even if this criteria is not met , parents can petition for @entity4 nationality for children born on @entity4 soil from age 13 if the child has lived in @entity4 at least five years			2
in @entity31 , one of a baby 's parents has to be a @entity31 citizen , or legally settled in the country , for the child to gain citizenship			0
@entity34 is another country which does not offer immediate legal rights to someone simply because they were born on @entity34 territory			0
mr @entity0 wants @entity4 to have similar restrictions because of the amount of illegal immigrants flooding into the country and having children			1
thousands of them are @entity44 gypsies who live in makeshift camps on the edge of major cities like @entity48 , often in large families			0
last week the deportation of a 15 - year - old @entity44 schoolgirl along with her parents and five siblings put immigration right back at the top of the political agenda			0
mr @entity0 , a protege of former conservative president @entity57 , said he would introduce a new parliamentary bill to cancel automatic nationality for children of illegal immigrants by the end of the year			1
' children born in @entity4 to parents illegally on @entity4 soil can not automatically become @entity4 , ' said mr @entity0			1

it has long pushed for a reform of the immigration system , to include the systematic deportation of illegal immigrants , and large cuts in the number being allowed into @entity4			2
mentor : mr @entity0 is a protege of former @entity4 president @entity57 the @entity74 is making huge electoral strides thanks mainly to the failing policies of @entity87 president @entity86			1

anti-immigrant rhetoric reached new heights earlier this month when interior minister @entity92 suggested that @entity44 gypsies could ' non integrate ' and should be deported			0
his hardline is supported by the vast majority of @entity4 people , according to recent polls , although there have been demonstrations against his policies by students			0
wednesday , mr @entity92 said proposals to overhaul @entity4 's asylum system in depth would be submitted to the government by mid-november , following several months of consultations			2
the reform will seek to shorten the amount of time between an application for asylum and the judge 's final decision .			0

@entity0 , leader of the @entity11 party , made the promise today
children of immigrants born in @entity4 can currently apply for citizenship
the system is less strict than other countries like @entity34 and the @entity31
