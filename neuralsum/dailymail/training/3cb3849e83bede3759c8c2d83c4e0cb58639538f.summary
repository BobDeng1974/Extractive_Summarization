a set of interactive maps have revealed how the world ’s emissions have dramatically changed over the last 160 years			2
the fascinating tools reveal how developed nations began to produce huge amounts of carbon dioxide after the @entity8			1
and they also reveal how @entity10 is quickly becoming the world ’s biggest emitter			1
use the interactive map below to see emissions over the last 160 years the maps were created by the @entity16 in @entity17 in the first map the carbon dioxide emissions of nations across the world from 1850 to 2011 are shown and in a second , the per capita emissions of each nation across the same time period are detailed			1
world - 45.914 billion tons 1			2
@entity10 - 10.26 billion tons 2			2
@entity26 - 6.135 billion tons 3			0
@entity27 - 4.263 billion tons 4			0
@entity28 - 2.358 billion tons 5			0
@entity29 - 2.217 billion tons 6			0
@entity30 - 2.053 billion tons 7			0
@entity31 - 1.419 billion tons 8			0
@entity32 - 1.17 billion tons 9			0
@entity33 - 847 million tons 10			0
@entity34 - 806 million tons the @entity16 says the total carbon dioxide emissions for the world are nearly 46 billion tons			1
the largest emitter is @entity10 at more than 10.26 billion tons , while the @entity26 comes in second at 6.135 billion tons			2
the maps were created using the @entity16 ’s @entity41 data , which compiles global emissions data			2
this uses climate data from research centres , government agencies and international bodies to measure the emissions of six major greenhouse gases from 1990 to 2011			0
carbon dioxide emissions , meanwhile , stretch back to 1850 in 185 countries			1
for more than 100 years since the industrial revolution emissions were dominated by the @entity53 , but over the last few decades @entity55 ’s emissions have rapidly caught up			1
in 2005 @entity10 became the world ’s largest emitter while several @entity59 countries including the @entity26 and @entity60 stabilised their carbon emissions - albeit at a high level			1
in the first map the carbon dioxide emissions for each nation are shown , while this second interactive map shows global emissions per capita the largest emitter is @entity10 at more than 10.26 billion tons , while the @entity26 comes in second at 6.135 billion tons			1

the @entity16 in @entity17 has mapped the emission of carbon dioxide around the world from 1850 to 2011
the @entity53 dominated emissions for a century after the industrial revolution
but now @entity55 - especially @entity10 - has caught up and is *usurping* other developed nations as the biggest emitter
in the first map the carbon dioxide emissions for each nation are shown
a second interactive map shows global emissions per capita
