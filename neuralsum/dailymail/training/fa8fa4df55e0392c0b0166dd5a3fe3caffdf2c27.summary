by @entity1 reporter published : 09:22 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 10 august 2013 pony patches : a new class of pilots is choosing to wear a patch in reference to the kids show ' @entity8 : friendship is @entity10 ' a new group of @entity13 pilots are comfortable enough in their masculinity to wear a ' @entity8 ' patch on their uniforms			1
the patch was chosen by the 24 student pilots of class 14 - 05 at @entity20 - one of four centers in the @entity22 where commissioned officers are trained to become professional pilots			1
their patch is an allusion to the sub-culture of ' bronies ' , male fans of the children 's show ' @entity8 : friendship is @entity10 '			1
the current show is a reboot of the 1980s cartoon and line of plastic pony toys			2
the new show has surprisingly spurned a sub-culture of male fans , and an increasing amount of these ' bronies ' are members of the military			1
but according to @entity20 spokesman 1st @entity48 @entity47 , this class 's patch was a joke and not reflective of their appreciation for the show			1
' it was kind of a fluke , ' lt @entity47 told @entity56			0
lt @entity47 explained that a student proposed the ' my little pilot : flying is @entity10 ' design as a joke during the slideshow presentation of patch options			1
' that patch made it all the way through the approval process and is even more ironic since the class never really wanted it in the first place , ' lt @entity47 said			1
' they thought it was so off the wall that it was hilarious			0
they have embraced the irony and the humor of the patch an in so doing have fostered closer ties with each other			2
' but the patch is far from unusual			2
class patches usually contain some reference to current pop culture , like the game angry birds or the movie @entity88			2
past patches : class patches are usually humorous and contain some reference to current pop culture			2
for example : a @entity94 patch , left , and an @entity96 patch , right and that 's exactly the point			2
' we train world - class pilots who will go on to defend out great nation			1
fostering camaraderie , morale and unity on a regular basis and through small means - like a tastefully humorous patch - enhances our ability to complete the mission when working as a team is essential , ' lt @entity47 told @entity112			0
but not all of the pilots - in - training were happy to wear the patch			1
one commenter on brony site @entity118 , who has a son in class 14 - 04 , witnessed a few trainees unhappy with the design			1
' there was at least one non-brony who straight up refused to wear it and i overheard another complaining to his mom about it , ' the commenter wrote			0
' but the fight instructor ( who was a captain ) was wearing it and he had no problems with his masculinity			0
' these discontent pilots may be reluctant to wear a patch that connects them to the real group of military bronies			1
passion : these military men call themselves ' @entity145 ' as they wear patches on their uniforms identifying themselves as fans of the show , @entity8 : friendship is @entity10 the show 's fanbase among members of the military began about two years ago when the show first began to air			1
nearly 9,000 people have ' liked ' a @entity159 page called ' @entity145			0
' the page highlights various members of the military in patrol situations while wearing the @entity8 patch			1
there are variations of the patch that typically include a cloud with a red , yellow and blue lightning bolt			0
' worth protecting ' : the show geared toward young girls has had a fanbase among members of the military , which started about three years ago when the show first began to air the design symbolizes a ' rainbow dash , ' which is used on the show			1
administrators of the @entity159 page said today that they do not advocate for servicemen to use the patches , especially if it goes against the rules of the military			0
on the @entity159 page , an administrator said : ' regardless of how easy it is for others to claim this , we do not promote wearing of unauthorized patches , badges or insignia on your uniform			0
' we do not recommend you do anything that goes against the regulations of your branch of service			0
' together : the phenomenon came to light as men in uniform joined the 4,000 fans gathered at the 2012 @entity203			1
the most recent @entity203 in @entity205 , @entity204 attracted 8,000 attendees a spokeswoman for the @entity208 told @entity209 that the military does not support unauthorized patches on uniforms			0
one soldier , @entity213 , defended the fanbase and its connection to the military			0
he said : ' you , the bronies , have taught me that there are things and people worth protecting ; things bigger and more important than myself			0
' a @entity223 member named @entity224 told @entity225 that he was amazed to see how welcoming other fans were at a brony convention			2
' we barely made it up to the top steps and everyone outside was cheering for us , ' he said			0
' i started clapping because i figured if everyone else was clapping i ’d do it too			0
then my friend was like , " no dude , they ’re clapping for us			0
" ' ' cheering ' : military members have said that their passion for @entity8 has been received with great acceptance by others and has strengthened their beliefs in the military the first @entity203 held in june 2011 and attracted only about 100 people who trickled into some meeting rooms in @entity245			1
but the fanbase has grown exponentially and the most recent @entity203 held in @entity205 , @entity204 last weekend had an attendance of about 8,000			0
ongoing : @entity8 has been around longer than the start of its current show as @entity250 released the first toys in 1983 , leading to television specials , a movie and a tv series in 1983 , @entity250 released the first @entity8 toys , which became popular among young girls , leading to television specials , a movie and the first tv series that ran from 1986 to 1987			1
the brand stuck around through the years , languishing in relative anonymity			0
but all that changed when @entity250 hired animator @entity263 , who breathed new life into the @entity8 concept by creating the @entity266 is magic series			2
@entity263 had worked on @entity268 and @entity269 before dreaming up the land of @entity118 , where @entity8 characters like @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 get go on exciting adventures .			2

the class patch for a new batch of @entity13 pilots plays on the show ' @entity8 : friendship is @entity10 '
the patch is an allusion to the *subculture* of ' bronies ' who are male fans of the show
a growing amount of military men have been showing up to brony conventions
a spokesman for the base says the patch was designed as a joke
