@entity0 spoke glowingly on wednesday morning of how @entity1 has become a leader and of his ability to ‘ talk smack ’ — and it was not long before the @entity5 showed exactly what the @entity7 captain meant			1
a few hours later the @entity5 took careful aim at @entity10 with a bit of ‘ smack ’ — banter — about how @entity13 and @entity14 are currently on the opposite sides of litigation proceedings involving management issues			1
by doing so , @entity1 took it upon himself to signal the end of the studiously bland build - up to the @entity21 and demonstrate that , in the absence of @entity24 , he is a senior figure determined to avoid another reverse at the hands of @entity10			1
@entity1 was talking at a press conference ahead of the @entity21 at @entity29 this weekend the @entity7 golfer has poked fun at @entity13 and @entity14 's ongoing court case @entity13 chats to @entity34 's @entity33 during a practice session on wednesday @entity14 and @entity13 celebrate together during the last @entity21 win at @entity37 his observation , while delivered with a smile on his face , was clearly premeditated and designed to exploit a rare potential crack in the home team ’s famously solid resolve			1
@entity1 was not going to be deterred by the sensitivity of the situation involving @entity13 ’s case against his former management company , with whom @entity14 is so closely associated			1
the 44 - year - old @entity7 ’s intervention also showed the well - disguised edge to his personality , for there was probably an element of retribution in the way he drew attention to what is an elephant inside the @entity62 team room			2
only wednesday morning @entity13 joked about how , as a bystander , @entity1 ‘ nearly hit me off the tee ’ with a famously wayward drive in the @entity66 after a change of equipment saw him play poorly in that edition			1
and then there was the world no 1 ’s observation two weeks ago that @entity1 and @entity24 may be playing the ‘ last few holes ’ of their top - flight golfing careers			2
@entity13 is suing his former management company @entity76 , where @entity14 is both a client and shareholder @entity1 chips out a bunker during the second day of official practice at @entity29 @entity1 does not see it that way , or it could just be that this week he feels emboldened by the absence of @entity24 — his old rival — in an event that has often seen him fail to demonstrate the true depth of his talent			1
the five - times major winner took a questioner to task for suggesting that his @entity21 record was a ‘ blot ’ on his career , but over the 10 occasions he has played he has lost 55 per cent of his matches , more than any other man in the competition ’s history			2
@entity100 the @entity62 team is a high - risk strategy			0
@entity1 has little form coming to @entity29 after a poor season in which a second place at the @entity105 has been his only top 10 finish			0
that is one reason why he is only one of the visiting team to hammer the underdog theme , something they clearly see as beneficial			0
on wednesday , @entity113 , who in 2008 was the last player to captain a winning @entity7 team , put out a succinct tweet outlining what he sees as the required mentality in these fixtures : ‘ this year @ @entity120 has a chip on its shoulder			0
normally it ’s @ @entity124 that plays with a chip			0
team with biggest chip wins			0
’ @entity62 team captain @entity129 chats with @entity14 and @entity13 on the course @entity132 's group tee off at the 14th on a picturesque @entity29 course on wednesday video the closing holes at @entity29 @entity1 acknowledged that he has had a poor year but was defiant about his prospects			1
‘ i followed my worst year prior to this in 2003 with one of my best in 2004 and expect to do the same next year , ’ he said			0
more immediately , he agreed that he needs to do some repair work on his @entity21 record and confirmed that he will play alongside @entity141 again in a repeat of their successful partnership of 2012			2
certainly , @entity145 has been a place where he has triumphed before , having won the @entity147 at @entity148 and @entity149 at @entity150			0
in the absence of @entity24 , @entity153 and @entity154 , the @entity7 team need @entity1 to perform and add a @entity21 to that			1
@entity7 team captain @entity0 expects @entity1 to lead the way @entity1 insists the pressure if off the @entity7 on foreign soil he was happy to pursue the @entity160 theme : ‘ it takes some of the pressure off , knowing that we are on away soil and that we have n’t won away for 20 years , ’ he said			2
‘ the expectations are n’t high but rather than focus on what we do n’t have , what we do have is a great group of 12 guys that really enjoy each other ’s company and have a lot of fun together , and we have got great leadership			0
‘ it really has got nothing to do with trying to redeem what happened two years ago			0
