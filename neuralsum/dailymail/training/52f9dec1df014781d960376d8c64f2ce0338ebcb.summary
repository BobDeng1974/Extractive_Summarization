milk , cheese , butter , cream - in fact all saturated fats - are bad for you			1
or so i believed ever since my days as a medical student nearly 30 years ago			0
during that time i assured friends and family that saturated fat would clog their arteries as surely as lard down a drain			1
so , too , would it make them pile on the pounds			0
recently , however , i have been forced to do a u-turn			0
it is time to apologise for all that useless advice i 've been dishing out about fat			2
we now have compelling evidence that low - fat diets rarely work and that eating the right kind of fat is not only good for your heart but may also help you lose weight			1
so why the sudden change ? and what is making us fat ? the roots of our current confusion lie in a paper by an @entity46 scientist called @entity47 in 1953			2
it covered the increasingly common problem of clogged arteries			0
keys included a simple graph comparing fat consumption and deaths from heart disease in men from six different countries			1
@entity46 , who ate a lot of fat , were far more likely to have a heart attack than the @entity61 , who ate little fat			1
or was it ? other scientists began wondering why keys chose to focus on just six countries when he had access to data for 22			0
if places like @entity74 and @entity75 were included the link between heart disease and fat consumption became much weaker			1
these were , after all , countries with high fat consumption , but relatively modest rates of heart disease			1
change of diet : dr @entity83 now eats more oily fish , @entity86 yoghurt and eggs in fact , as a renowned @entity90 scientist called @entity91 pointed out , there was actually a much stronger link between sugar consumption and heart disease			1
professor @entity91 argued that sugar was behind the rise in heart disease ravaging the @entity99			1
he also pointed to another dangerous trend emerging in @entity101 : the close relationship between the number of televisions being bought and fatal heart attacks			1
buying a tv in the @entity107 was a sign that you were affluent , but it also meant you 'd spend a lot more time sitting down			0
this research was among the first to highlight the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle			0
but @entity91 's warnings about sugar were denounced by a fellow scientist as ' nothing more than scientific fraud '			1
he was , as one of his colleagues colourfully put it , ' thrown under a bus '			0
meanwhile , the war on fat gradually gained momentum , to the extent that by the time i reached medical school in the @entity132 , there was no mention of @entity91 's findings			1
people were cutting down on dairy products and switching to sugary carbohydrates and vegetable oils			2
this , it turns out , was a mistake			0
to turn vegetable oil into margarine , manufacturers used a process called hydrogenation ( gas pumped through oil at high temperature ) , which produces trans fats			1
these are the @entity152 of the fat world : good fats turned bad			1
unlike saturated fats , there is clear evidence that trans fats damage your heart			1
they were found in most shop - bought biscuits and cakes until they were removed in 2007			0
which was a bit late in the day for me			0
as a student i took the advice that saturated fats - not hydrogenated fats - were the enemy very seriously			1
i was slim and i did a lot of exercise , but i also ate butter and burgers			2
with a family history of heart disease , strokes and a father who 'd just been diagnosed diabetic , i told myself it was time to act			1
i persuaded my father to go on a low - fat diet			2
he lost a little weight , but soon gave up			2
reluctantly , i said goodbye to beef , switched to skimmed milk and avoided yoghurt with any hint of fat			1
it made for a much duller diet , but at least i was healthier			0
or was i ? well , no. i kept this up for the next few decades - and the results ? i put on over two stone , despite regular exercise			2
my cholesterol soared past the healthy range and two years ago i discovered i was borderline diabetic			0
while i did n't look fat , i 'd piled on the pounds in the worst place possible : tucked away in my abdomen , coating internal organs			2
my response was to exercise more but it had little effect			0
i was eating less fat , but compensating with starchy pasta and potatoes			0
what i had n't appreciated is the way these foods act on your body			0
a boiled potato will push your blood glucose up almost as fast as a tablespoon of sugar , since it is rapidly digested			0
ironically , we now know that if you eat that potato with butter , the fat will slow absorption and the blood sugar peak will be less extreme			1
rapid spikes in glucose force your pancreas to pump out insulin , which drives it back down , but can leave you hungry again a few hours later			0
carbohydrates are also less satiating than fat or protein			2
so you eat more and the weight creeps up			2
back on the menu : eggs are now celebrated for their protein content while adding butter to potatoes can prevent a spike in blood sugar levels eggs are a prime example of how we got it wrong on fats			1
in the @entity132 we were told they were cholesterol time bombs and were warned to eat no more than one a week			1
so i gave up eggs and tried to persuade my family to do likewise			0
what a mistake that was			0
a study in the @entity248 in 2013 concluded : ' higher consumption of eggs is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke			1
' so eggs are back , and the protein means you 'll feel fuller for longer			2
so , is fat really fattening ? it contains far more calories than carbohydrates or protein , and the easiest way to lose weight is obviously to cut it out			1
yet low - fat diets rarely succeed because people wo n't stick to them - they get too hungry			1
in the @entity107 , @entity269 professor @entity268 argued that we should be eating more fat , not less			0
he 'd been to @entity271 and was intrigued to see that the @entity272 had a high - fat diet yet low rates of heart disease			1
was something in oily fish protecting them ? he decided to find out by eating nothing but seal , oily fish , molluscs and crustaceans			0
while making @entity285 for the @entity286 , i decided to repeat his experiment			0
thankfully , the seal we tried to import was impounded by customs , so i ate a diet mainly of fish			0
@entity268 stuck to his for three months , i managed a month			0
while on his diet , @entity268 timed how long it took for his blood to clot by cutting himself once a week			0
it increased from three minutes to a terrifying 50			0
for me , it doubled			0
even though he 'd taken it to dangerous extremes , @entity268 showed that fish oils reduce the stickiness of platelets in your blood and thus the risk of clot formation , which can lead to a heart attack or stroke			0
a more recent example of how wrong we were about low - fat diets was the @entity313 trial , which began in 2001			2
over 5,000 overweight diabetics were put on a low - fat diet and encouraged to exercise			2
the @entity316 says the average man should eat no more than 30g of saturated fat a day , and the average woman no more than 20g after almost ten years the study was stopped			1
those on the low - fat diet had lost little more than a control group , and there was no significant change in heart attacks or strokes			1
a study last year put a further nail in the low - fat diet 's coffin			2
a group of 7,500 men and women were randomly allocated a low - fat diet or a much higher - fat @entity337 one			0
on this diet , along with fruit , vegetables , meat and fish , they were to eat oily nuts , olive oil and have a glass of wine with their meal			0
again , the trial was stopped early			0
but this time it was because those on the @entity337 diet were doing so much better than those on the low - fat diet , with a 30 per cent drop in heart attacks and strokes			1
so some fats are good for us , but surely saturated fats are bad ? even this has been undermined by a study funded by the @entity363 and published this year			1
based on 72 previous studies the researchers found no evidence that saturated fats cause heart disease			1
this is n't a licence to pour cream down your throat , because even if saturated fats do n't directly harm the heart , too many calories will			1
personally , i try not to have biscuits and cakes in our house as i know i ca n't resist them			0
but i have gone back to butter , @entity86 yoghurt and semi-skimmed milk			2
i eat more oily fish , eggs and the odd burger			2
after all those years believing them the enemy , saturated fats taste more delicious than ever			1
dr @entity83 is the author of @entity390			1

dr @entity83 used to believe all saturated fats were bad for us
so he *ditched* beef , full fat milk and butter
they were thought to cause weight gain and heart attacks
but new studies have revealed this is n't the case
there 's a stronger link between sugar consumption and heart disease
eggs are a prime example of how we got it wrong on fats
people were advised to eat just one a week in the @entity132
but now regular consumption is encouraged as they are high in protein
