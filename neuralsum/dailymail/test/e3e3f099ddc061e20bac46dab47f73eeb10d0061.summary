@entity0 removed both @entity2 openers after choosing to bowl first in a rain - shortened opening session of the second test in @entity6 but the under - pressure visitors has a major stroke of fortune			1
after @entity10 castled @entity11 with a venomous in - swinger in the third over , @entity12 had @entity15 caught behind			1
@entity15 should still be there , however , after replays clearly showed the ball had missed his outside edge as he thrust forward outside off stump			2
replays show @entity15 clearly misses the ball before being dismissed caught behind off @entity12 @entity15 declines his choice to review the decision with @entity24 not available in this test series with @entity24 technology not available in this test as part of the decision review system , @entity15 declined to try his luck upstairs and walked off			1
that left the hosts 36 for two at lunch , with 15 overs gone			0
play was delayed by an hour and 45 minutes after persistent morning showers , with 11 overs lost in the day			0
despite having sent down 130 overs in the fourth innings of the drawn first test , captain @entity39 pressed his bowlers back into action , persuaded by humid conditions and a touch of dampness in the pitch			0
@entity10 , who overtook sir @entity49 to become the country 's leading @entity51 wicket - taker in @entity53 last week , made an early down payment on that decision			1
@entity12 celebrates his first wicket of this match , @entity15 , as the @entity2 went to lunch 36 for two @entity15 is given out as @entity0 players celebrate their second wicket of a rain - shortened first session he clattered @entity11 's leg stump having forced the batsman off balance with some prodigious movement through the air			1
the opener had already seen one edge fall short of the slips off @entity10 , who was challenging the bat more readily than @entity70			2
@entity70 's opening five overs cost just eight runs but he largely pitched too short to cause concern			0
@entity10 was close to a second when @entity75 , defending on the back foot , sent a thick edge in the direction of third slip			2
@entity11 is first to fall as @entity10 bowls the @entity2 opener with a massive in - swinger @entity83 races to celebrate with @entity10 after the opening bowler makes the breakthrough @entity83 fell quickly to his right but the ball grounded just in front of him			1
@entity12 saw a tough chance shelled at leg - slip by @entity91 , stationed there at @entity94 's behest , but @entity15 ( 15 ) did not take his luck			0
he is the first @entity6 to play @entity51 on the island but fell in ignominious fashion , following a wide ball that should have been left with the interval imminent			2
the confusion over whether or not he had edged it - and why he did not send the decision upstairs - merely added intrigue to a careless exit			0
the last over before lunch went to @entity105 , fit again and recalled in place of @entity107 .			0

@entity2 opener @entity11 missed the ball but did *n't* review it
his *apparent* edge went to @entity113 off the bowling of @entity12
with @entity24 not available in this @entity51 , @entity11 accepted the dismissal
no doubt about @entity10 's bowling of @entity11
@entity2 went into lunch on day one in @entity6 on 36 for two
