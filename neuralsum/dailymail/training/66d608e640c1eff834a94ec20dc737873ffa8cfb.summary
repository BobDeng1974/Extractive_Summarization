the romance of the @entity1 was in pitifully short supply at @entity3 as @entity4 and @entity5 played out an instantly forgettable goalless draw			1
chances were at a premium as neither side could take a firm grip on proceedings and the result is a @entity14 replay that only adds to an already - hectic @entity16 schedule			0
it was @entity4 ’s lowest crowd of the season and those who bothered to turn up on a dreary afternoon by the @entity21 will feel no inclination to tune in for the highlights			1
@entity5 striker @entity24 ( right ) came close to opening the scoring in the first half but he struck the post @entity28 puts his hands to his head after he misses a sitter following up @entity33 's shot @entity28 ( left ) and @entity4 's @entity35 battle for the ball during the match at @entity3 @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 diamond ) : @entity39 7 ; @entity40 7 , @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 6.5 , @entity43 6 ; @entity44 ( c ) 7 ; @entity35 6 ( @entity45 32 , 6 ) , @entity46 6.5 ; @entity47 6.5 ; @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 ( @entity50 70 ) subs not used : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , burn booked : @entity44 17 @entity5 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity57 6 ; @entity58 6 , @entity59 ( c ) 6.5 , @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 6 ; @entity62 6 , @entity63 6 , @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity33 7.5 ; @entity28 6.5 ( @entity66 62 ) subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 booked : @entity62 69 attendance : 11,879 referee : @entity76 man of the match : @entity33 ratings by @entity80 at @entity3 the game ’s best chance fell to @entity28 of @entity5 , who somehow missed an open goal from eight yards out after the impressive @entity33 had seen a low angled drive touched onto the post by goalkeeper @entity39			1
@entity33 , the strong and powerful @entity86 international , was the game ’s stand - out performer and @entity5 will miss him as he flies off to the @entity88 in @entity89			1
the tournament also serves as a shop window and manager @entity92 is braced for interest from @entity95 suitors			0
he said : ‘ we ’d love to keep him , but every transfer window there ’s constant speculation on him			0
he ’s been very consistent for me in @entity102 and the @entity16			0
‘ wherever you are , your best players can be vulnerable			0
if we can keep him , that would be absolutely fantastic			0
‘ we ’ve always been honest with the player about @entity95 possibilities			0
his ambition is the @entity95 but so is ours			0
’ kit symons clearly feels @entity4 can go on a bit of a @entity1 run and fielded a strong side , while @entity92 made four changes from the team that beat @entity116 before the @entity117			1
@entity49 reacts with disappointment after missing a chance during the match @entity4 striker @entity48 attempts an acrobatic effort during saturday 's third round @entity1 tie it was a soporific start , with the sole moment of cheer in the opening 20 minutes coming when @entity5 goalkeeper @entity57 booted a clearance clean over the stand and into the river			1
slowly , both sides started to carve out chances and the quiet crowd responded			0
@entity64 picked out @entity28 with a right - wing cross but the striker ’s header , though firm , was directed straight at @entity39			2
after @entity49 had dispatched a shot half - way up the @entity138 , @entity5 broke swiftly before @entity33 ’s daisy - cutter dribbled tamely through to @entity39			1
the best chance of the half fell to @entity33 just on the half - hour			2
the @entity86 strode imperiously down the left and struck a low angled shot that cracked the base of the post with the goalkeeper getting a touch			1
it rebounded perfectly for @entity28 but he somehow missed the unguarded net from eight yards			2
@entity35 's afternoon ended after half - an - hour when he was replaced by @entity45 @entity4 's @entity43 ( near ) protects the ball under pressure from @entity152 ( far ) five minutes shy of half - time , the ever - willing @entity40 crossed from the right and @entity48 , largely ineffective , attempted a spectacular overhead kick that narrowly cleared the bar			2
@entity33 had been @entity5 ’ greatest threat and , in stoppage time , he curled a set - piece over the target at the other end			1
the visitors started the second - half with purpose and @entity28 tore to the byline to cut the ball back to @entity62			1
his powerful shot was blocked by @entity39 at the near post			2
the home faithful raised their voices to try and rouse @entity4 and it had the desired effect , with first @entity49 and then @entity174 sending shots over			2
@entity4 striker @entity48 ( right ) vies for possession with @entity5 ' @entity58 @entity58 climbs above @entity4 striker @entity47 as the tie ends goalless @entity178 through the second - half @entity64 ’s header from a @entity61 cross was tipped over the bar by @entity39 and the midfielder was played through shortly afterwards after @entity41 slipped up			1
the defender was rescued by @entity39 , who pushed @entity64 ’s effort round the post			2
@entity33 looked the most likely to score by far and , after cutting inside from the left , he curled a shot that flashed past the far post with @entity39 rooted to the turf			1
in the last five minutes , @entity4 broke following a @entity5 corner and @entity44 flicked the ball forward to @entity192 sprinting clear			1
he hurried his shot and @entity57 palmed it away on the edge of his box			0
@entity4 manager kit @entity196 offers encouragement to his players from the touchline @entity4 boss kit @entity196 said : ‘ it was a probably a typical @entity1 tie , lot of blood and guts , lot of endeavour but it lacked that little bit of quality , that little bit of craft and guile			1
‘ you can see by the team we put out today , we took it very seriously			0
it ’s the @entity1 , it deserves to be treated with the utmost respect			0
‘ we knew it would be tough and hard - fought as @entity5 are a big , powerful , well - organised side			0
i hoped we ’d match that and have the quality to break them down , but some of our decision making in the final third was n’t there today			0

@entity4 and @entity5 draw at @entity3 in the @entity1 third round
@entity33 almost gave visitors the lead but hit the post with low strike
@entity28 then put the rebound wide with the goal *gaping*
@entity4 could not even manager a shot on target until the 88th minute
