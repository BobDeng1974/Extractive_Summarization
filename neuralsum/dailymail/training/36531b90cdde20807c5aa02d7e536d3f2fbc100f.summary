@entity5 's problems were first spotted at her mother ’s 20 week scan during pregnancy			2
ms @entity11 , from @entity32 , said : ‘ we found out at @entity5 's five month scan that she had a heart defect and the doctors said she would need a heart operation when she was born			1
‘ i got to hold her for one second and then they took her straight away			0
they monitored her oxygen saturation and at three weeks old she had her first op. ’ @entity5 was born with an atrioventricular septal defect which meant there was a hole between the upper filling chambers and the lower pumping chambers of her heart			1
it also meant she only had one valve between the atria and ventricles instead of the normal two			0
