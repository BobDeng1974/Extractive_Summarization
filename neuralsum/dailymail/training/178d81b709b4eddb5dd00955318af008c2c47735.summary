her lawyer , @entity15 , said ms @entity8 had received approval from president @entity17 for the ceremony to take place			0
corporal @entity10 , left , was shot dead by @entity11			2
his girlfriend @entity21 , right , has been given permission to wed him posthumously posthumous marriages are unusual in @entity24 , but they can be sanctioned in ‘ grave circumstances ’ , said mr @entity15			2
' i ’ve already had it done twice , for policemen ’s girlfriends , ' he said			0
' it ’s a really moving ceremony with an empty chair representing the dead spouse			0
' there wo n’t be any problems with approval , and the marriage will allow the new child to have a father			0
' the brother of @entity40 appeared before an anti-terrorist judge today and was formally charged with ‘ complicity in murder ’			2
meanwhile the fall - out from last week 's massascre has led to an escalation in religious tension , with @entity49 graves being desecrated across @entity24			1
riot police have also been called to housing estates on the outskirts of major cities like @entity54 because of anti-semitic demonstrations being held in support of the 23 - year - old killer			0
@entity58 killed three schoolchildren , a rabbi and three paratroopers @entity62 , the 29 - year - old brother of @entity11 , appeared in court today after allegations that he was close to a @entity49 school last monday when his 23 - year - old sibling gunned down a rabbi , his two children , and a teenage pupil			1
he is also believed to have assisted his brother in an attack on @entity24 paratroopers , which saw three shot dead			2
under conditions of utmost security in central @entity54 this morning , @entity62 was driven to the @entity77 in an armoured convoy			0
there a criminal investigation was opened which could see the self - confessed @entity82 extremist jailed for life			0
in a statement read out soon afterwards , the @entity84 said : ‘ the investigations being handled by the police have established the existence of serious evidence against @entity62 corroborating , or making plausible , his participation as an accomplice in the commission of crimes in connection with a terrorist enterprise			0
’ @entity62 was remanded in custody , and taken to a high - security prison in @entity54 , where he is likely to remain until his trial			0
@entity100 has already told police interrogators that he was ‘ very proud ’ of what @entity11 did , and admitted to dining with him just before the attack on the @entity104 school in @entity5			1
‘ signals from @entity62 ’s mobile phone were emitted close to the school at the time of the murders , ’ said an investigating source			0
among numerous questions @entity113 is facing is how @entity11 got hold of an arsenal of weapons , including an @entity118 sub-machine gun , and even the kind of @entity121 gun used by @entity123 soldiers during the @entity124			2
it is also believed that @entity126 also helped his brother buy the @entity128 motorbike used in all the attacks , and to respray the vehicle and remove its tracking device			2
meanwhile , new video footage released by police shows the inside of the @entity5 apartment where @entity11 had his last stand			1
suspect : police escort @entity62 to the @entity24 police 's anti-terrorist headquarters in @entity140 , outside @entity54 on saturday the chaotic flat is cluttered with furniture strewn across each room blocking the way , and one wall is peppered in what looks like bullet holes			1
@entity11 is being held up as an martyr in some quarters , with @entity49 cemeteries targeted in attacks which police are linking to the @entity154 atrocities			1
on thursday night @entity155 - a symbol of @entity156 - were torn off some 30 graves in the eastern @entity49 cemetery in the @entity160 city of @entity161			1
lanterns were also stolen from more than 20 sealed tombs in the same cemetery , with local police commissioner @entity165 saying all were targeted ' because they are @entity49 , while @entity168 graves nearby were ignored			2
' @entity169 , the chief rabbi in @entity161 , said there had been similar attacks on other cemeteries since @entity11 was shot dead on thursday , adding that there was a ' possible connection with the @entity5 killings			1
' bullet holes line the wall of the apartment of @entity11 , the self - proclaimed @entity82 extremist who killed seven people also on thursday , graffiti including ' @entity154 ' and ' vengeance ! ' appeared on a prominent wall in the @entity54 suburb of @entity185 as youths gathered to ' honour ' the killer			1
' they were mainly kids who are trying to make a political point out of these horrific crimes , ' said a local police spokesman			0
' police have broken up similar gatherings on other estates around @entity54 , and other cities , where @entity11 is being portrayed by a tiny minority as martyr			0
' a teacher from @entity201 , in northern @entity24 , was also suspended after organising a minute 's silence for @entity11 , saying he was a ' victim ' who had a difficult childhood on an immigrant housing estate in @entity5			1
@entity11 , who filmed himself carrying out the executions of four @entity49 people and three @entity24 soldiers who had fought in @entity208 , was a self - styled jihadist			1
he said he wanted to kill @entity49 children in revenge for the lives of @entity214 youngsters who had died at the hands of the @entity217 army			0
victims : @entity219 , 30 , @entity10 , 25 , and @entity220 , 26 were killed by @entity11 last week there are some 500,000 @entity49 in @entity24 , and security measures around them have increased after @entity11 shot a rabbi and three children at a school in @entity5 last monday			1
there are some six million @entity227 living in @entity24 , making up the largest group of its kind in western @entity231 , but @entity82 leaders have rejected @entity11 as being utterly unrepresentative of a largely peace - loving and law - abiding community			1
@entity11 was gunned down by special forces outside his council flat in @entity5 last thursday following a fierce firefight			1
@entity238 had been arrested the day before along with his 30 - year - old wife - who has not been named - and the brothers ’ divorced mother , @entity242 , 54			0
at one point , police brought his mother to the scene , but she refused to urge her son to surrender , officials said			0
both women have now been released , and have expressed shock at the decision to charge @entity100 , who denies having anything to do with his brother ’s crimes			0
network : 23 - year - old killer @entity11 , who is said to have met with @entity123 jihadists in @entity208 tragic : the mother and father of @entity24 paratrooper @entity262 carry a portrait of their son as they wait for his body 's arrival at @entity270 airport evidence has also emerged that @entity11 was in touch with @entity123 jihadists preparing terrorist atrocities across the world			1
during a visit to @entity208 just over a year ago , @entity11 was using the codename ‘ @entity5 ’ , which was passed to the @entity123 authorities			1
@entity54 security sources believe that both @entity11 brothers were involved in two local @entity282 organisations , @entity283 ( @entity284 ) and a more militant jihadist network known as the @entity5 group , or @entity287			2
@entity288 , an @entity290 splinter group , has already admitted to working with a ‘ @entity291 ’ - who is believed to be @entity11			2
‘ not only were members of these groups in touch with @entity123 @entity298 while in @entity231 , but they would have met them in @entity208 , ’ said one security source in the @entity24 capital			0
‘ there is a window as later as 2010 when @entity11 would have been in touch with jihadists from all over the world			0
’ ' siege ' : the block of apartments in which gunman @entity11 was shot by police after a stand - off the source said that @entity11 was known to have entered @entity311 , the @entity311 on november 13th 2010 , after a journey across @entity313 and @entity314			2
