a @entity1 neurologist claims to have found the area of the brain where evil lurks in killers , rapists and robbers			1
@entity9 scientist dr @entity8 says the ' evil patch ' lies in the brain 's central lobe and shows up as a dark mass on x-rays			1
he discovered it when investigating violent convicted offenders over the years for @entity1 government studies			1
dr @entity8 demonstrates where the ' evil patch ' can be identified in the brains of those inclined to violence scans studied by dr @entity8 indicate that the patch he says is associated with wicked behaviour is found at the front of the brain ' we showed these people short films and measured their brain waves , ' he said			1
' whenever there were brutal and squalid scenes the subjects showed no emotions			0
in the areas of the brain where we create compassion and sorrow , nothing happened			2
' the dark mass at the front of the brain , he says , appears in all scans of people with records for criminal violence			1
he says his researches have led him to believe that some criminals have a ' genetic predisposition ' to violence			2
he added : ' when you look at the brain scans of hardened criminals , there are almost always severe shortcomings in the lower forehead part of the brain			1
' there are cases where someone becomes criminal as a result of a tumour or an injury in that area , and after an operation to remove the tumour , that person was completely normal again			2
dictators : @entity73 ( left ) and @entity74 ( right ) belong to dr @entity8 's third group - pure psychopaths ' or there are physiological deficits , because certain substances such as serotonin in the forebrain are not working effectively			0
' but this is definitely the region of the brain where evil is formed and where it lurks			1
' of course it is not automatic			0
the brain can compensate somewhat for violent tendencies and it is unclear how that works			2
@entity90 is a personality disorder that has been variously characterised by shallow emotions ( including reduced fear , a lack of empathy , and stress tolerance ) , coldheartedness , egocentricity , superficial charm , manipulativeness , irresponsibility , impulsivity , criminality , antisocial behavior , a lack of remorse , and a parasitic lifestyle			0
terrorists are sometimes called psychopaths , and comparisons can be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence , a selfish worldview that precludes welfare for others , lack of remorse or guilt , and blaming external events			2
while no psychiatric or psychological organisation has sanctioned a diagnosis of ' psychopathy ' itself , assessments of psychopathy are widely used in criminal justice settings in some nations and may have important consequences for individuals			0
' but when i will look at young people , and i see there are developmental disorders in the lower forehead brain , i can say that there is a felon in the making with 66 per cent probability			1
' it is easy to spot this anti-social behaviour from very early on			0
' dr @entity8 said no two criminals are alike			0
he divides them into three groups for the purposes of his hunt for evil			1
the first he classifies as ' psychologically healthy , ' people who grow up in an environment where it is ' ok to beat , steal and murder '			1
the second type is the mentally disturbed criminal who looks at his world as threatening			0
' a wrong look , one false move , he can explode and become a killer , ' he said			0
the third group are pure psycopaths , a group in which tyrants such as @entity74 and @entity73 belong			0
he said not all monsters are born and that many are made worse by their environments on their roads to evil			2
he added : ' experts detect a mental decline in some people that begins in the kindergarten			0
it is the task of society to offer widespread support to the children and their parents before they become criminals			0
' dr @entity8 is one of @entity1 's best - known brain specialists and has was at the forefront of calling for sentencing reforms a few years ago .			1

scans reveal a patch at the front of the brain can be seen in people with records for criminal violence
@entity1 scientist who made the discovery classifies evil in three groups

@entity1:German
@entity9:Bremen
@entity8:Roth
@entity74:Hitler
@entity73:Stalin
@entity90:Psychpathy
