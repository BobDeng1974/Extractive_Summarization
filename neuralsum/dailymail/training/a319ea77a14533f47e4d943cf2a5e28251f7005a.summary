the 25 - year - old singer was not at the @entity2 in @entity3 to hear three judges headed by the lord chief justice lord judge reject his case			2
at @entity17 in february , the pop star , whose real name is @entity16 , was given a six - month sentence , suspended for 18 months , in connection with a brawl at a petrol station			1
he was also ordered to carry out 150 hours of community service			2
his co-defendants , @entity24 - the brother of @entity1 â€™s partner @entity26 - and songwriter @entity27 both lost appeals against their sentences			1
@entity26 , 25 , of @entity30 , west @entity3 , who denied affray and said he only acted to protect @entity1 , was found guilty and jailed for 14 months			1
@entity27 , 28 , of @entity33 , west @entity3 , pleaded guilty to affray and was sentenced to 19 months			1
mr @entity34 said neither sentence was manifestly excessive in what was a serious affray			2
the trial heard that the brawl started after @entity1 spat at a man who stepped in to protect two women , @entity42 and @entity43 , with whom the singer had started arguing			1
at the appeal , his lawyers argued that the trial judge should not have admitted evidence of a 2008 assault conviction which involved spitting , and was wrong not to discharge the jury after a newspaper published an article accompanied by a photo of the singer spitting			0
they alleged this created a real risk of serious prejudice			0
mr @entity34 said that the judge was fully entitled to admit the 2008 conviction and to conclude that it would not be right to discharge the jury			0
witnesses : it was alleged that @entity1 spat at @entity42 , left , and @entity43 , right , after they rejected his advances ' the photo in this case does not show him spitting at anyone			2
it shows him simply spitting			0
' he added that the judge weighed up matters with care and indicated he would remind the jury that they must decide the case on the evidence they heard in court , which he did			0
in his judgment , the jury was not deflected from a proper and fair analysis of the evidence			0
