president @entity0 and @entity2 prime minister @entity1 told a packed house of reporters friday that @entity5 should hold off on legislation that would impose tough new sanctions on @entity8 as talks about that nation 's nuclear ambitions continue			1
' my message to @entity5 is " just hold your fire " , ' @entity0 said during a rare joint @entity17 press conference , insisting that he can easily fall back on a new sanctions regime if talks fail			1
' that 's not a difficult vote for me to get through @entity5 , ' he said , asking for ' a few months ' to avert a larger crisis			0
@entity1 acknowledged that he has been active in lobbying @entity23 senators , urging them to consider taking a wait - and - see approach			1
' yes , i have contacted a couple of senators this morning and i may speak to one or two more this afternoon , ' he said , while cautioning that he was not calling ' as @entity2 prime minister to tell the @entity28 what they should or should n't do			1
that would n't be right			0
' ' and they could fracture the international unity that there 's been , which has been so valuable in presenting a united front to @entity8			2
' ' we should not impose further sanctions now , ' @entity1 had already said during his opening statement , in a clear shot across @entity5 's bow			1
@entity8 has maintained that it 's only developing nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes but @entity64 and the @entity23 are skeptical – and determined not to let the @entity66 's mullahs take possession of a nuclear weapon that could target @entity69 or other countries			1
a press aide to @entity72 senator @entity72 of @entity73 , one of the two lawmakers most visible in crafting a new sanctions proposal , said a call with @entity1 had been scheduled for friday but never took place			1
but @entity72 said in a statement that ' @entity8 sanctions were signed into law four times with bipartisan , veto - proof majorities in the @entity28 and the @entity17			1
' ' if anything can stop @entity8 from getting nuclear weapons , it is maintaining the united bipartisan front in @entity5 to end @entity8 ’s uranium enrichment and plutonium paths to the bomb			2
now is the time to stand united against @entity8 ’s nuclear threat , not to divide into partisan corners			1
' a spokesperson for @entity95 sen. @entity94 of @entity96 , @entity72 's counterpart on the bipartisan measure , did not respond to a request for comment about whether he had spoken with @entity1			2
but @entity94 vowed on friday to push ahead with his bill			2
' all i 'm saying , ' he declared during a press conference in @entity96 , ' is let us put in prospective sanctions that do n't get imposed , do n't get imposed , until july			1
' @entity94 said he has a ' fundamental disagreement ' with the @entity0 administration			0
@entity1 defended his tactics on friday , along with the current level of pressure the @entity111 has put on @entity8			2
@entity112 : @entity0 calls @entity1 ' bro , ' it has emerged in recent days , and they expressed mutual admiration during friday 's press conference ; the two are shown thursday in the @entity118 of the @entity17 ' i think the big picture is very clear , ' he said : sanctions that @entity23 and the @entity122 put in place have had an effect			1
that has led to pressure , that pressure has led to talks , adn those talks at least have a prospect of success			0
' ' i would argue with the president : how much better is that than the other potential outcomes			0
' ' @entity5 needs to show patience , ' @entity0 agreed			0
' with respect to the veto ... i will veto a bill that comes to my desk			0
and i will make this argument to the @entity23 people as to why i 'm doing so			0
' ' under the interim deal that brought @entity8 to the table , we were not supposed to initiate new sanctions			2
' he dismissed the argument that the latest congressional legislative language does n't impose new economic penalties on @entity8 , but merely promises them if talks fail			1
' i assure you that is not how @entity8 would interpret it , or our partners would interpret it			0
so the likelihood of the entire negotiations collapsing is very high			0
and if that happens , there is no constraint on @entity8 at that point going back and doing exactly what it had been doing before they came to the table : developing a heavy - water reactor that , once built , is extraordinarily difficult to dismantle and very difficult to hit militarily			0
' he also warned that @entity8 would develop more advanced centrifuges for fissionable material and return to underground bunkers			0
' and they would be able to maintain that the reason they ended negotiations , ' @entity0 warned , ' was that the @entity23 was operating in bad faith , and blew up the deal			1
' ' there would be some sympathy to that view around the world , which means that the sanctions that we have in place now would potentially fray – because imposing these sanctions are a hardship on a number of countries around the world			2
they would love to be able to buy @entity8 oil			0
' promise : @entity0 vowed to @entity5 that he ' will be the first one to come to @entity5 and say we need to tighten the screws ' if @entity8 backs away from the bargaining table ' there is no good argument for us to try to undercut , undermine the negotiations until they 've played themselves out , ' the president said			1
' now if @entity8 ends up ultimately not being able to say yes , if they can not provide us the kinds of assurances that would lead myself , @entity1 and others to conclude that they are not obtaining a nuclear weapon , then we are going to have to explore other options			1
' ' and i will be the first one , ' he pledged , ' to come to @entity5 and say we need to tighten the screws			0
' @entity1 said that ' if the @entity8 say no , and there is no deal , then by all means let 's sit down and work out what extra sanctions to put in place			1
' ' we 're absolutely united in a simple thought , which is : a deal that takes @entity8 away from a nuclear weapon is better than either @entity8 having a nuclear weapon or military action to prevent it			2
in the end it comes down to that simple choice			0
' @entity0 emphasized that ' i am not – repeat , not – suggesting we are on immediate war footing , should negotiations fail			1
' but he warned the new @entity72 - dominated @entity28 that there will be a political price to pay if the threat of new sanctions torpedoes a deal with @entity231			0
' @entity5 should be aware that if this diplomatic solution fails , then the risk and likelihood that this ends up at some point being a military confrontation is heightened , ' he said			0
' and @entity5 will have to own that as well , and that will have to be debated by the @entity23 people			0

joint press conference saw the two world leaders agreeing that @entity8 nuclear talks should be given more time to work
prime minister @entity1 said ' war footing ' would be one alternative if talks fail
senators from both sides of the aisle are readying a bill that would impose new sanctions on the @entity257 *republic* but @entity0 has vowed to veto it
@entity0 insisted that ' i am not – repeat , not – suggesting we are on immediate war footing , should negotiations fail '
@entity266 offices are n't *confirming* calls from @entity1 but he cautioned he was n't telling @entity23 lawmakers ' what they should or should n't do '
