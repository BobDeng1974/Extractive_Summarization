by @entity0 published : 15:38 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 24 september 2013 disgraced former governor @entity2 was one of two wealthy candidates who lost their local political races after spending more than $ 10million on the campaigns , campaign finance reports have revealed			1
@entity2 spent $ 10.3million on his failed bid to become @entity8 's next comptroller , while billionaire grocery store magnate @entity9 spent $ 10.4million on his race to win the @entity12 primary vote for the city 's mayoral race			1
the @entity15 today cited the latest round of campaign disclosure statements that revealed how much the losses hurt the men ’s respective wallets			2
last minute bid : disgraced former governor @entity2 made a late - and costly - entry to the city 's race for comptroller that ended up costing him $ 10.3million @entity2 's late entry to the comptroller race caused a stir , not only because it put his prostitution scandal back in the headlines five years after he resigned from office , but also because of the sheer amount of money that he was willing to spend			1
apparently it was n't enough as he ended up losing 48 - 52 to @entity36 , who spent about $ 6million			2
' all along we knew it was going to be a close race , ' @entity2 campaign spokeswoman @entity37 told @entity41 at his party on the night of the primary			0
' yes people know @entity2 and he has name recognition but @entity36 has the entire political establishment behind him - every union , every business			0
' the breakdown between how much he actually contributed to his campaign and how much of the $ 10.3m came from public donations was not publicly available , but it is safe to assume that a good portion came from his own bank account			0
@entity2 's net worth is not known , but the years since leaving the governor 's mansion have been profitable ones for the @entity59 as @entity2 and his wife @entity60 made a combined total of $ 4.27million in 2012 alone			2
big spender : @entity9 spent $ 10.4million on his failed bid to become the @entity12 nominee for the @entity8 mayoral race , and he has an estimated net worth of about $ 3.1billion while @entity2 's family is very wealthy and his father @entity68 is thought to have a net worth of around $ 500million , that is nothing compared to the @entity71 fortune			1
the 65 - year - old @entity74 - @entity73 grocery tycoon was pegged by @entity75 as being worth $ 3.1billion though that may be on the low end of the spectrum			0
deep pockets : billionaire @entity80 spent a whopping total of $ 265million on all three of his mayoral campaigns his campaign to become the @entity12 mayoral candidate ended up costing $ 10.4million			1
the wasted money apparently does n't bother @entity86 , even though his rival @entity87 ended up beating him by 12 points after having only spent $ 3.8million on his campaign			1
' you know how much it bothers me that my opponent said that i was trying to buy the election ? zero			0
cause when people met me , they loved me			0
and i loved them , ' mr @entity9 told @entity15			0
in spite of the seven - figure sums that both @entity2 and @entity71 put up for their respective failures , both pale in comparison to the amounts that current mayor @entity80 spent on his three campaigns			1
when the self - made billionaire first ran for office in 2001 , he spent $ 73million on the campaign and entered himself into the record books for being the costliest non-presidential campaign in @entity73 history up until that point			1
he outdid himself in 2005 when he spent a further $ 84million to get re-elected and then a staggering $ 108million after the term limits restrictions were overturned , allowing him to hold on to the title of ‘ @entity113 ’ until this november			0
the whopping total of $ 265million that @entity80 spent on his races - not to mention additional millions covering transition costs and other expenses - is a drop in the bucket for him , however , as his net worth is estimated to be around $ 31billion			2
while he spent a fortune on the races , he did n’t cost the city very much himself as he took a salary of $ 1 - per - year in office and opted to live in his own @entity127 apartment so that @entity128 , the building traditionally used to house the @entity130 ’s mayor , could be rented out for events .			0

the disgraced former governor made a late entry to the comptroller 's race that ended with him out $ 10.3million and *shy* four points of winning
@entity12 mayoral candidate @entity9 had the costliest campaign as his failed bid totaled $ 10.4m
both pale in comparison to @entity80 's three mayoral campaigns where he spent $ 73m , $ 84m , and $ 103m per respective campaign
