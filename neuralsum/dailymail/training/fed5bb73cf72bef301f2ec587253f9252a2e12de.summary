by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 20:31 est , 15 february 2013 the number of gay men catching @entity3 has almost doubled in 20 years because new drugs have encouraged unsafe sex , new research shows			1
between 1990 and 2010 , cases rose by 76 per cent due to fewer people using condoms			1
experts say this is due to the introduction of antiretroviral drugs that are effective in treating the disease			2
during this time there was a 26 per cent increase in the proportion having unprotected sex , according to the study			1
the number of gay men catching @entity3 has almost doubled in 20 years because new drugs have encouraged unsafe sex professor @entity21 , of @entity22 , said : ' we created a model reconstructing the @entity3 epidemic in men who have sex with men in the @entity29			1
' in doing so , we were able to explore the interplay between hiv testing rates , antiretroviral ( @entity34 ) treatment and sexual behaviour on @entity3 transmission and incidence			0
' by better understanding the driving forces behind the trends we have seen in the past , it will allow us to make informed choices to reduce new hiv infections in the future			0
' but the findings , published in the journal @entity47 , suggest the increase in infections would have been 68 per cent greater without the introduction of @entity34 in the same period , and 400 per cent more if condom use among men who have sex with other men had ceased entirely from the year 2000 onwards			1
dr @entity56 , head of @entity3 surveillance at the @entity58 , said : ' our research provides important evidence to support current @entity29 public health recommendations on expanded @entity3 testing and higher levels of art coverage , to reduce new infections among men who have sex with men			2
but the findings also suggest infections would have been 68 per cent greater without the introduction of antiretroval drugs ' however , we see it is also vital condom use education continues as not only does this have a strong limiting effect on the @entity3 epidemic , but only a modest increase in unprotected sex is enough to erode the benefits of other interventions			1
' exploring other scenarios , the research found cases would have reduced by 25 per cent if hiv testing levels had been higher , by 32 per cent if @entity34 had been prescribed at diagnosis or by 62 per cent if both interventions had been combined			0
effective art therapy reduces how infectious peple with @entity3 are , lowering the risk of transmission			0
dr @entity56 added : ' everyone should use a condom when having sex with new or casual partners , until all partners have had a sexual health screen			0
' we also encourage men who have sex with men to get an @entity3 and @entity101 screen at least annually , and every three months if having condomless sex with new or casual partners - and clinicians to take every opportunity to recommend @entity3 testing to this group			2
' through combining earlier and more frequent hiv testing , programmes that reduce unsafe sexual behaviour and higher levels of art coverage for those requiring it , we could substantially reduce @entity3 transmission in this group			0

between 1990 and 2010 there was a 26 per cent increase in the number of men having unprotected sex
cases of @entity3 rose by 76 per cent in this period
experts say introduction of effective drugs is to blame
