cities really are brighter places during the holidays , @entity0 has revealed			2
in a series of stunning images , it found the holidays can cause a cities lights to be boosted by 50 %			1
the series of pictures shows @entity11 and @entity12 's in the @entity13 and the holy month of @entity14 in the @entity15			1
dark green pixels are areas where lights are 50 percent brighter , or more , during december			1
the @entity23 satellite , a joint @entity0 / @entity24 ( @entity24 ) mission , carries an instrument called the @entity31 ( @entity31 )			0
@entity31 can observe the dark side of the planet – and detect the glow of lights in cities and towns worldwide			2
the new analysis of holiday lights uses an advanced algorithm , developed at @entity0 's @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , that filters out moonlight , clouds and airborne particles in order to isolate city lights on a daily basis			2
' even from space , holidays shine bright , ' @entity0 said			0
researchers analysed daily data from the @entity24 / @entity54 ( @entity23 ) satellite			0
they were able to track how patterns in nighttime light intensity change during major holiday seasons – @entity11 and @entity12 's in the @entity13 and the holy month of @entity14 in the @entity15			1
around many major @entity13 cities , nighttime lights shine 20 to 50 percent brighter during @entity11 and @entity12 's when compared to light output during the rest of the year , as seen in the satellite data			1
in some @entity15 cities , nighttime lights shine more than 50 percent brighter during @entity14 , compared to the rest of the year			1
the new analysis of holiday lights uses an advanced algorithm , developed @entity68 's @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , that filters out moonlight , clouds and airborne particles in order to isolate city lights on a daily basis			2
the data from this algorithm provide high - quality satellite information on light output across the globe , allowing scientists to track when – and how brightly – people illuminate the night			0
in the @entity13 , the lights started getting brighter on ' @entity85 , ' the day after @entity82 , and continued through @entity83 , said @entity86 , a research physical scientist at @entity41 and member of the @entity89 , who co-led this research			1
he and his colleagues examined the light output in 2012 and 2013 in 70 @entity13 cities , as a first step in determining patterns in urban energy use – a key factor in greenhouse gas emissions			2
in most suburbs and outskirts of major cities , light intensity increased by 30 to 50 percent			0
lights in the central urban areas did not increase as much as in the suburbs , but still brightened by 20 to 30 percent			0
' it 's a near ubiquitous signal			0
despite being ethnically and religiously diverse , we found that the @entity13 experiences a holiday increase that is present across most urban communities , ' @entity86 said			1
' these lighting patterns are tracking a national shared tradition			0
' because snow reflects so much light , the researchers could only analyze snow - free cities			0
they focused on the @entity13 @entity116 from @entity117 and @entity118 , and cities south of a rough imaginary line from @entity121 to @entity122 the team focused on the @entity13 @entity116 from @entity117 and @entity118 , and cities south of a rough imaginary line from @entity121 to @entity122 the new analysis of holiday lights uses an advanced algorithm , developed @entity68 's @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , that filters out moonlight , clouds and airborne particles in order to isolate city lights on a daily basis			1
the team also examined lighting patterns across 30 major towns in @entity138 , known for its vibrant nocturnal celebrations and for having one of the longest @entity11 holiday periods			1
' overall , we see less light increases in the dense urban centers , compared to the suburbs and small towns where you have more yard space and single - family homes , ' said @entity150 , a @entity151 and @entity152 candidate at @entity154 's @entity153 , @entity155 , @entity156 , who co-led the study with @entity86			0
these new results , illustrating holidays in lights , were presented at the @entity163 's @entity162 in @entity117			0
the idea to look at holiday light - use patterns stemmed from one of the first analyses of the new daily lights algorithm , @entity86 said			2
colleagues from @entity41 and @entity154 were looking data of @entity171 in 2012 and noticed a large discrepancy			0
' either you have something going on with your data that 's wrong , or there 's a real signal there that you have to look into , ' @entity86 recalls them saying			0
when the team investigated the satellite record , they found that the large increase in light output in @entity185 's capital corresponded with the holy month of @entity14			1
during @entity14 , @entity186 fast during the day , pushing meals and many social gatherings , markets , commerce and more to nighttime hours			1
in several cities in the @entity15 , city lights brighten during the @entity195 holy month of @entity14 , as seen using a new analysis of daily data from the @entity0 - @entity24 @entity23 satellite			1
dark green pixels are areas where the lights are 50 percent brighter , or more , during @entity14			1
to confirm that the nighttime signal was not merely an instrument artifact , they examined three consecutive years worth of data from 2012 through the fall of 2014			0
they found that the peaks in light use closely tracked the @entity195 calendar , as @entity14 shifted earlier in the summer			1
but not all @entity15 cities responded the same as @entity171			2
light use in @entity215 cities , such as @entity216 and @entity217 , increased by about 60 to 100 percent through the month of @entity14			1
light use in @entity219 cities , however , increased far less			0
some regions in @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 did not have an increase in light output , or even demonstrated a moderate decrease , possibly due to unstable electrical grids or conflict in the region			0
' even within majority @entity195 populations , there are a lot of variations , ' @entity150 said			0
' what we 've seen is that these lighting patterns track cultural variation within the @entity15			2

team looked at @entity11 in the @entity13 and found lights shone 50 % brighter during holiday season
lights started getting brighter on ' @entity85 , ' the day after @entity82 , and continued through @entity83
also studied the holy month of @entity14 in the @entity15 and found lights boosted by a *similar* amount
