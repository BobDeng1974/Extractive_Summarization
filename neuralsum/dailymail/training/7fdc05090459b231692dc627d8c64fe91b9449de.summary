the former chancellor warned @entity14 risks a decade of ‘ bumping along the bottom ’ , and @entity4 needs to set out a credible ‘ direction of travel ’			1
mr @entity3 said the party must come clean about what it would spend in 2015/16 once the government ’s spending review is completed on june 26			2
mr @entity3 said : ‘ we wo n’t know the baseline of the government ’s spending limits until the june spending review			0
but we will during the course of this year have to set out the parameters			0
’ the @entity4 grandee added the party was already spelling out detailed spending plans two years before the 1997 election to ‘ establish in the public ’s mind what our priorities were			1
so people can see your direction of travel			2
’ he warned voters need to see plans for growth			2
‘ my fear is we could be bumping along the bottom for an entire decade if not longer , ’ he said			0
mr @entity3 spoke out as @entity4 mp @entity44 called for a ‘ u-turn ’ on welfare to please @entity4 voters dissatisfied with welfare handouts			1
he said : ‘ i think what we need to do is set out the sort of welfare state and the level of benefits we would be willing to pay for			0
‘ it would be the biggest u-turn we ’ve done on the strategy that we employed over the period of the last @entity4 government			2
’ but challenged over why he thought mr @entity8 was not doing better – with the @entity4 lead down to single digits in some polls – mr @entity3 offered only faint praise			1
‘ i think that @entity8 has been a lot more successful than people gave him credit for when he was first appointed , ’ he told journalists at a lunch in @entity64			2
spending : with less than two years before the general election , @entity8 and @entity68 are under pressure to say what they would do with the nation 's finances mr @entity3 , who had running battles with @entity76 during the dying days of the @entity4 government , also refused to be drawn on the tense relationship with his former friend			1
asked how many times they had spoken since mr @entity76 was forced out of @entity82 three years ago , mr @entity3 suggested it was few , if any			1
he said : ' i have never provided a running commentary on any conversations i may or may not have had			0
' this week there has been renewed speculation that mr @entity68 could be moved from the @entity90 brief ahead of the election			0
mr @entity92 is fronting the @entity93 campaign against @entity95 independence , which will be wound up after the referendum in autumn next year			0
asked if he would like a return to the @entity4 frontbench , mr @entity3 suggested the backbenches were not for him , adding : ‘ at the moment i am totally focussed on the referendum between now and october 2014 and after that i will see where i stand			1
’ he promised to ‘ maintain an interest in wider affairs ’			0
during a wide ranging speech , mr @entity3 set out an alternative economic plan , backing a third runway at @entity108 , calling for more housebuilding and rejecting the idea of privatising the nationalised banks too soon he warned that five years after the financial crisis which began on his watch , there was little sign of improvement with the @entity117 forced to take comfort from not falling into a triple dip recession			1

tense relations : asked how many times he had spoken to @entity76 since leaving power in 2010 , mr @entity3 said only that he would not provide a ' running commentary in the @entity134 this year the government announced a £ 130billion mortgage guarantee scheme to kickstart the housing market			1
but mr @entity3 warned it risked creating a new housing bubble because it will force up prices without increasing supply of homes			1
‘ the risk is if you put in measures which make it easier to buy … but you do n’t do anything about the supply of housing you simply put the prices up			2
we have enough experience in this country of what bubbles can do			0
‘ i would have preferred if @entity155 had done something more to speed up the supply of housing rather than doing something which will undoubtedly make some people feel better			2
‘ i think the result is if you look at @entity162 where people struggle to rent and to buy , simply putting more money into the system after an existing stock seems to me to be asking for trouble			0
’ he added that the @entity169 of @entity170 we need extra runway capacity , and defied mr @entity8 ; s policy to back the idea of @entity108 expansion			1
he said @entity176 ’s plan for a new airport in the @entity178 is a ‘ complete nonsense ’ .			0
