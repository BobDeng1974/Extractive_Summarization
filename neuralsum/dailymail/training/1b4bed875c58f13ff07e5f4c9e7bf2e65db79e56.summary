health experts assembled by the @entity1 conceded on friday that a second case of @entity3 could be identified in the @entity4 but they defiantly insisted that the epidemic plaguing western @entity6 will not rise to the level of a major @entity4 outbreak			1
the deaths of approximately 3,500 people in western @entity6 nations are due to lax public health procedures and infrastructure – problems the @entity4 does n't face – according to @entity16 chief dr. @entity15 , @entity18 's homeland security assistant @entity17 , hhs secretary @entity19 and @entity21 administrator @entity20			1
@entity15 and @entity22 specifically said there 's no guarantee the sole @entity4 - diagnosed case of the illness in @entity27 will be the only one			1
' we have a case now , and it 's entirely conceivable there will be another case , ' said @entity15			2
@entity15 told reporters that the @entity6 pandemic has erupted ' because the health care infrastructure and system ' in @entity42 , @entity59 and @entity60 ' is inadequate and incapable of actually handling the kind of identification , isolation , rapid treatment , protection of the people who are coming into contact , and contact tracing			1
' ' that 's something that we have very , very well established here , ' he declared			0
@entity17 echoed him minutes later , saying that ' it is entirely possible we will see another case			0
' but the overall feeling of the sparsely attended afternoon press conference was one of complacency , with the @entity18 administration 's top @entity3 spear - catchers saying over and over that @entity4 have nothing to fear even though the government has no plans to close airports to planes originating in at the disease 's ground - zero			1
' the @entity4 people should be confident , ' @entity17 said , ' because the public health infrastructure we have here is so expert , is so extensive , and is considerable			1
' that confidence could come back to haunt the administration if a series of potential @entity3 cases in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity99 turn out to be anything but false alarms			2
@entity15 acknowledged that the fear associated with the virus , which kills more than half of the people it infects , will be a formidable public - relations obstacle if the situation worsens			1
' there are many things when you have outbreaks , ' he said			0
' it 's the unknown			0
it 's the cataclysmic nature of it – namely , it 's acute , it kills in a high percentage , and it kills quickly			1
that in and of itself , almost intuitively , makes people frightened			0
' he imagined his response to panicked @entity4 left wondering if they might be next			2
' the other thing that makes people frightened , ' he said , is : ' " can this happen to me without my even knowing it ? without my having any behavioral change at all ? " ' ' and that 's the kind of thing that we have to keep over and over again emphasizing : we respect your concern , we understand your concern , but the evidence base tells us that that is not going to happen			0
and we have to say that a lot			0
' @entity15 found himself pushing back against incredulous reporters who demanded to know why biosecurity lapses in the @entity27 case would n't repeat themselves			2
@entity17 , assistant to the president for @entity141 and @entity142 , conceded that the lone @entity3 case in @entity27 might not be the last the patient lied on his exit paperwork when he left @entity42 , saying he had n't been in contact with any contagious @entity3 patients			1
in fact , he had carried a violently convulsing pregnant woman to safety only a day earlier			0
once in the @entity4 , the first hospital that saw him sent him home with antibiotics after a clinician failed to note he had recently traveled to @entity27 from @entity6			1
and it took more than two days for a hazardous materials crew to clean up the apartment where the man was staying after he was finally secured in an isolation ward			0
' i never say i 'm not concerned , ' @entity15 responded , ' because that 's interpreted as taking something lightly			0
' ' but i 'm convinced , ' he said ' that the system that 's in place , with our health care infrastructure , that it would be extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak			2
' speaking to journalists aboard @entity173 during a fundraising trip , @entity1 press secretary @entity171 said president @entity18 has no immediate plans to respond personally to @entity4 ' ebola fears with a speech to soothe their nerves			1
' are we going to hear from him at all on the @entity3 issue ? ' one reporter asked			2
' today , you mean ? ' @entity171 responded			0
' i do n't anticipate that you will today			0
