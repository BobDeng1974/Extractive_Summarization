first time mothers who had a @entity1 are more likely to report pain during sex more than a year later			1
a new study found the majority of women resumed having sex three months after giving birth			1
but women who had a caesarean section were twice as likely to report pain during or after sex even 18 months after having the baby			1
this was compared to women who had a normal vaginal birth			2
new mothers who had a caesarean section , or whose babies were delivered using the help of vacuum extraction were twice as likely to suffer pain during sex 18 months after giving birth c - section mums had double the risk of pain during sex even compared to women who had a vaginal birth but who suffered a tear in their perineum – the area between the vagina and anus - but did n't need stitches			1
however , the study did not look at women who had had a difficult vaginal birth			2
the researchers also did not offer an explanation as to why certain deliveries led to more pain than others			0
however they concluded that more understanding about how a birth can affect a mother is needed , and ways to prevent pain during sex should be explored			1
a caesarean involves making a cut in the front wall of a woman ’s stomach and womb			0
it is usually carried out under an epidural , where the lower part of the body is numbed , but is sometimes carried out under general anaesthetic			0
it usually takes 40 - 50 minutes , but can be performed quicker in an emergency			0
mothers who had a vaginal birth using vacuum extraction – in which a midwife applies a vacuum with a soft or rigid cup to the baby 's head to help guide it out of the vagina – were also twice as likely to report pain more than a year after giving birth			1
the study examined data from 1,244 first time mothers across six maternity hospitals in @entity82 , @entity83			1
a caesarean section is an operation to deliver a baby			0
it involves making a cut in the front wall of a woman ’s abdomen and womb			0
the operation can be a planned ( elective ) when a medical need for the operation becomes apparent during pregnancy			0
it can also be an emergency procedure , when circumstances before or during labour call for delivery of the baby by unplanned @entity1 a caesarean section is usually carried out under epidural or spinal anaesthetic , where the lower part of your body is numbed			2
it usually takes 40 - 50 minutes , but can be performed quicker in an emergency			0
some caesarean sections are performed under general anaesthetic			0
a caesarean section is usually carried out when a normal vaginal birth could put the mother or unborn baby at risk			0
this could be if the labour does n't progress naturally , the mother has placenta praevia ( where the placenta is low lying in the womb and covering part of the womb 's entrance )			0
other reasons include if the mother has had two or more previous caesarean sections or their baby is in the breech ( bottom first ) position			0
source : @entity132 the mothers filled in questionnaires at 3 , 6 , 12 and 18 months			2
of the women , 49 per cent had a vaginal birth , and two thirds of these women had a tear in the area between their vagina and anus that needed stitches , or an episiotomy			2
this is a procedure where the midwife deliberately cuts this area to make the opening larger for the baby to get through			0
nearly 11 per cent of women had a vaginal birth with their baby helped out by vacuum extraction , and for another 11 per cent of women , their baby was helped out by forceps			2
less than 10 per cent were delivered by an elective caesarean section – where a medical reason meant the mother had opted for this operation before the birth			2
another 20 per cent were delivered by an emergency caesarean section , which meant events before or during labour eventually meant this operation has to be carried out even thought the mother had not initially chosen it			0
the researchers found 78 per cent of women resumed having sex three months after having their baby			1
by six months , 94 per cent of women had resumed having sex ; 97 per cent resumed 12 months after giving birth and 98 per cent 18 months afterwards			1
however most of the women ( 86 per cent ) who had started having sex again 12 months after the birth experienced pain			1
and nearly 45 per cent reported pain at three months after the birth			1
this went down to 43 per cent at six months , 28 per cent at 12 month and 23 per cent by 18 months			0
of those that reported pain during sex at six months after having their baby , a third said this pain persisted a year later			2
women who had an elective caesarean section , an emergency caesarean section or a vaginal birth with vaccum extraction were twice as likely to report pain during sex 18 months after giving birth			1
the researchers said other factors associated with pain during sex at this time include whether the women experienced it before becoming pregnant , partner abuse and fatigue			1
while 78 per cent of women resumed having sex three months after giving birth , 45 per cent experienced pain during sex			1
a third of women with pain at six months after the birth said this pain persisted a year later one of the study 's authors , @entity215 , from the @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity83 said : ' almost all women experience some pain during first sexual intercourse following childbirth			1
' however , our findings show the extent to which women report persisting pain at six and 18 months after birth is influenced by events during labour and birth , in particular caesarean section and vacuum extraction delivery			1
' not enough is known about the longer term impact of procedures on the mother 's health			0
' the fact that pain during sex is more common among women experiencing operative procedures points to the need for focusing clinical attention on ways to help women experiencing ongoing illness , and increased efforts to prevent illness after birth where possible			1
' @entity249 , deputy editor - in - chief of the @entity250 , added : ' this is the first study with detailed , frequent and long - term follow - up to assess associations of dyspareunia with obstetric risk factors			0
' this study provides us with robust evidence about the extent and persistence of pain during sex after birth and associations with mode of delivery and cuts to the perineum			2
' future research could look into ways of preventing pain during sex			0

three months after giving birth 78 **%** of women resumed having sex
nearly 45 **%** of first time mothers experience pain during sex after the birth
women who have a @entity1 or birth were twice as likely to suffer pain
mothers whose babies were delivered using a vacuum also had more pain
