@entity0 will suffer the ignominy of training with the under 21 side following his return to @entity4			1
the forward has been on loan at @entity7 but has returned to @entity8 early after @entity10 manager @entity9 made it clear he had no future at the club			2
however , there will be no place for the former @entity16 forward in @entity17 first - team plans , meaning @entity0 will be told to train with @entity4 's under 21 side			1
@entity0 has returned from his loan at @entity7 ( left ) early and is now back with @entity4 @entity0 posted a photo of himself on @entity22 in @entity4 training kit during a gym session @entity4 boss @entity17 wo n't risk the harmony in his squad by giving @entity0 another chance age : 21 born : @entity29 , @entity30 position : midfielder clubs : @entity16 ( 2010 - 12 ) , @entity4 ( 2012 - ) , @entity34 ( loan , 2012 - 13 ) , @entity36 ( loan , 2014 ) , @entity7 ( loan , 2014 ) career appearances : 80 career goals : 14 @entity17 is delighted with his squad 's dynamic following their excellent start to the season and does n't want to do anything that may harm that			1
@entity0 and @entity17 have not always seen eye - to - eye since the 21 - year - old 's arrival at the club in 2012 , and the manager fears the talented forward could have a disruptive influence at @entity8			0
the @entity4 will try to sell @entity0 in the january transfer window , but know that will be easier said than done			2
@entity0 is understood to have an £ 18million release clause in his contract , but @entity4 will let him leave for a mere fraction of that price just to get him of their books			1
if they do n't find a buyer they will even consider the option of paying - up the remaining seven months of his contract to ensure he leaves the club as soon as possible			0
@entity4 's third option will be to let him run down his contract when he becomes a free agent in the summer			0
despite the club 's seeming desperation to rid themselves of @entity0 in the coming weeks , there remains regret they were unable to make the move work			0
the midfielder has been at @entity4 for two - and - a - half years and scored this great solo goal against @entity75 the 21 - year - old ( right ) takes a shot during a match for @entity36 against @entity78 in march @entity0 holds off the challenge of @entity80 during a @entity82 game for @entity4 last december sir @entity83 persuaded @entity17 to take a chance on @entity0 during a @entity86 event ahead of his move to east @entity88 in january 2012 , insisting @entity4 would be signing potentially one of the best players of a generation if they could keep him focused			1
the @entity4 knew at the time the move for @entity0 would represent a major gamble , but because of his undoubted potential felt it was gamble worth taking			0
but it looks certain he has played his last game for @entity4 .			0

@entity0 has returned from his loan spell at @entity7 early
but he is not wanted by @entity4 and they could sell him in january
@entity17 is *unwilling* to give the midfielder another first - team chance
@entity0 has an £ 18m release clause but the @entity4 will sell for less
