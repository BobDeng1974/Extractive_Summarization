by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 03:39 est , 6 september 2012 scientists have found the oldest bugs ever to be preserved in amber			1
the specimens - one fly and two mites - were found in millimeter - scale droplets of amber from northeastern @entity8			1
they are about 100million years older than any other amber arthropod - invertebrate animals that include insects , arachnids , and crustaceans - ever collected			1
the finding has echoes of @entity16 , in which dinosaurs are cloned from dna found in blood from a mosquito preserved in amber			1
the group 's findings , which are published today in the @entity28 , pave the way for a better evolutionary understanding of the most diverse group of organisms in the world			2
' @entity34 is an extremely valuable tool for paleontologists because it preserves specimens with microscopic fidelity , allowing uniquely accurate estimates of the amount of evolutionary change over millions of years , ' said author @entity43 , a curator in the @entity45 's @entity44 and a world authority on amber and fossil arthropods			1
in the hit 1993 film , @entity49 hires scientists use dinosaur dna taken from a mosquito preserved in amber to clone the animals and create a theme park			1
even though arthropods are more than 400 million years old , until now , the oldest record of the animals in amber dates to about 130 million years			1
the newly discovered arthropods break that mold with an age of 230 million years			1
they are the first arthropods to be found in amber from the @entity67			1
these photomicrographs are of the two new species of ancient gall mites in 230 - million - year - old amber droplets from northeastern @entity8 , taken at 1000x magnification			1
the gall mites were named ( left ) @entity74 and ( right ) @entity75			0
globules of fossilized resin are typically called amber			2
@entity34 ranges in age from the @entity80 ( about 340 million years ago ) to about 40,000 years ago			1
it is produced by myriad plants , from tree ferns to flowering trees , but predominantly by conifers			0
the amber droplets , most between 2 - 6 millimeters long , were buried in outcrops high in the @entity88 of northeastern @entity8 and excavated by @entity89 and @entity90 of the @entity91			2
about 70,000 of the miniscule droplets were screened for by a team of @entity95 scientists			0
two of the specimens are new species of mites , named @entity74 and @entity75			0
they are the oldest fossils in an extremely specialized group called @entity102 that has about 3,500 living species , all of which feed on plants and sometimes form abnormal growth called ' galls			0
' the ancient gall mites are surprisingly similar to ones seen today			0
' you would think that by going back to the @entity67 you 'd find a transitional form of gall mite , but no , ' @entity43 said			2
' even 230 million years ago , all of the distinguishing features of this family were there â€” a long , segmented body ; only two pairs of legs instead of the usual four found in mites ; unique feather claws , and mouthparts			1
' the ancient mites likely fed on the leaves of the tree that ultimately preserved them , a conifer in the extinct family @entity128			2
although about 97 percent of today 's gall mites feed on flowering plants , @entity74 and @entity75 existed prior to the appearance and rapid radiation of flowering plants			0
this finding reveals the evolutionary endurance of the mites			0
' we now know that gall mites are very adaptable , ' @entity43 said			0
life imitating art ? @entity49 in @entity16 , with ( left to right ) @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 @entity144 , @entity49 , @entity141 and @entity145 on the set of @entity16 in 1993			0
now , it could become reality thanks to an @entity150 billionaire			0
' when flowering plants entered the scene , these mites shifted their feeding habits , and today , only 3 percent of the species live on conifers			0
' this shows how gall mites tracked plants in time and evolved with their hosts			0
' the third amber specimen , a fly , can not be identified because , outside of the insect 's antennae , its body parts were not well preserved			2
but now that the researchers have shown that amber preserved @entity67 arthropods , they are eager to find more specimens			1
' there was a huge change in the flora and fauna in the @entity67 because it was right after one of the most profound mass extinctions in history , at the end of the @entity180 , ' @entity43 said			2
' it 's an important time to study if you want to know how life evolved			0

insects are 100 million years older than any other amber arthropod ever collected
arthropods first to be found in amber from the @entity67
find echoes the amber - preserved insect used to *recreate* dinosaurs in the hit film
