@entity0 face @entity1 in the @entity3 opener in @entity4 on friday with @entity6 ’s side seeking a championship title or @entity8 as a precursor to their challenge at the @entity11			1
here , @entity12 joins @entity14 captain @entity13 and @entity11 winner @entity15 - who savoured @entity17 and global success with @entity0 - to discuss the week ahead and the events to follow … @entity0 captain @entity13 ( left ) and @entity11 winner @entity15 spoke to @entity12 @entity13 ( centre ) tries to break through the tackle of two @entity23 defenders during @entity0 's loss @entity15 ( left ) kicks the winning drop goal in the 2003 @entity11 final against @entity27 @entity13 ( left ) , @entity15 ( centre ) and @entity12 's @entity29 during the interview @entity1 captain @entity31 ( left ) and @entity0 skipper @entity13 pose with the @entity3 trophy @entity29 : does it feel like you ’re being pitched straight in at the deep end in this @entity3 ? @entity13 : very much so			1
it was the same last year away to @entity37			2
we fell five minutes short of an 80 - minute performance which cost us the game and , potentially , a @entity8			2
going to @entity1 , after what happened to us there in 2013 ( losing 30 - 3 ) , we have a core group of players who experienced that and i ’m sure we ’ll be more prepared this time			1
@entity13 puts his hand to his head during @entity0 's humiliating 30 - 3 loss in @entity4 in 2012 @entity31 ( centre ) breaks clear of the @entity0 defence during @entity1 ' thumping victory wales celebrate lifting the @entity3 trophy after beating @entity0 30 - 3 in @entity4 in 2012 @entity55 : there has been so much focus on that 2013 game - was that one of your worst days as a test player and how determined are you to banish those ghosts ? @entity63 : it was			1
to have a loss like that , the biggest loss ( by @entity0 ) against @entity1 and that place in the history books is not a nice thing to have on your cv			1
we found ourselves chasing the game , the crowd were on top of us and they had all the momentum , so the floodgates opened			0
we want to rectify that and we ’ll be ready for everything			0
@entity6 ( fourth right ) and @entity13 ( third right ) look despondent after the defeat in @entity4 @entity1 winger @entity84 ( left ) goes over to score the second try for the home side in 2012 @entity13 looks on during the exclusive interview with @entity12 's @entity29 @entity88 ( front ) runs with the ball as @entity0 's @entity91 ( second right ) tries to ankle tap him @entity55 : @entity15 , did you find @entity4 one of the toughest places to go as an @entity0 player ? @entity15 : it ’s a hell of a place to go			1
in 2013 , @entity0 knew @entity1 would come out firing , but they just could n’t realise how much			1
it is impossible to be prepared for how much a community and a country can turn up the pressure			0
when you have thousands of people sitting together watching rugby , how can it be so different ? but it is there			0
wales in the @entity109 manages to produce a unique atmosphere			0
@entity0 's players stand under the posts looking despondent during the defeat to @entity1 in 2012 @entity15 speaks and gestures with his hands during the exclusive interview with @entity12 's @entity29 @entity55 : what makes the @entity0 - @entity1 rivalry so special and intense ? @entity63 : a lot comes down to how well they have done in recent years			1
they ’ve won @entity122 and we want those honours for ourselves			0
in 2013 we probably did n’t know quite what it meant , to go into the heartland of @entity1 to try to win a @entity8			1
@entity6 spoke to us about going into the eye of a storm and that ’s what it was			0
that passion we experienced has really built that rivalry among us players			0
@entity136 : what comes to the fore when @entity0 play @entity1 is that they will do anything to defend the pride and honour of their country			1
that makes it a really physical battle but @entity1 also have some of that ‘ @entity37 flair ’ , too			2
when we played them in the quarter - final of the @entity11 in 2003 , i ’d never been attacked like that before			1
they just went for it , and that is what @entity1 can do to you			2
@entity15 kicks a drop goal during an @entity0 vs @entity1 match in the @entity3 @entity15 ( right ) holds on to the ball as the @entity1 defence attempts to bring him to the ground @entity55 : how relevant is this game to the @entity11 pool match later in the year ? 35 - @entity15 holds the @entity3 record for most points scored in a game			1
the former @entity0 fly - half scored 35 in an 80 - 23 win over @entity169 in 2003			1
@entity136 : you could play this game then play each other again the week after and the result could be very different			0
when you think like that , eight months is a long time so whoever wins this game wo n’t necessarily win the next			2
but it is a huge opportunity to become familiar with the intensity that will be required			0
@entity63 : there is a lot riding on this game , with everything coming up , but eight months is a long time to keep developing - and we will be playing that @entity11 game at @entity186 , which is important			1
i know they kindly offered to stage it in @entity4 but i ’m glad it ’s going to be here ! this trip to the @entity109 will produce a similar amount of pressure as we ’ll have to deal with at the @entity11 , so this will be useful mental preparation			1
@entity13 ( left ) and @entity15 laugh as they pose for photos for @entity198 @entity15 ( right ) attempts to get past @entity1 centre @entity199 during a match in february 2010 @entity55 : how crucial is it for @entity0 to win the @entity3 title or @entity8 to create momentum ? @entity63 : after three second - place finishes of course we want to go one better this time , but a lot of the northern - hemisphere teams went well in the autumn and we all want to finish top of the pile in @entity213 , to give us that extra confidence going into the @entity11			1
@entity136 : during my career , there were definitely moments when we cleared major psychological barriers			0
beating @entity27 in 2000 - when we won in the last minute - was one and the @entity8 in 2003 was another			2
even if we had n’t won it , i still think we were on the right track for the @entity11 that year			2
you want to clear those psychological barriers , but @entity0 beat @entity227 in 2012 by a hell of a score and nobody thought , “ that ’s it , we ’ve cracked it ”			2
@entity231 crashes over the line to score @entity0 's first try in a win over @entity235 in 2003 @entity15 , with a bloodied lip , holds aloft the @entity3 trophy following @entity0 's @entity3 win in 2003 @entity13 ( left ) and @entity15 pose for photos after their exclusive interview with @entity12 's @entity29 @entity240 ( right ) swallow dives over the tryline during @entity0 's famous victory over @entity227 in 2012 @entity55 : a home @entity11 will put huge pressure on the @entity0 captain			1
how will you cope with that , @entity13 ? @entity63 : the good thing about it being a home @entity11 is that , when you have the occasional day off , you can go home , see loved ones and escape the rugby bubble			1
we ’re not quite sure about the magnitude of it yet , but escaping the pressure is all about surrounding yourself with the right people and switching off when you can			0
you have to be focused on the job , but it is important from that mental side to have a down day now and again			0
@entity13 holds the @entity263 aloft following @entity0 's victory over @entity27 in november @entity13 ( left ) , @entity15 ( centre ) and @entity12 's @entity29 ( right ) during the exclusive interview @entity55 : @entity15 , how do you assess the progress @entity13 has made as a player and as @entity0 captain ? @entity136 : when i first came into the @entity0 squad , i felt like a rabbit in the headlights but @entity13 seemed to fit in straightaway			1
he is full of respect and good values , but when he ’s out on the field you give him a job and he does it right every time			0
he just gets on with things without making a big song and dance			0
he has grown and grown , and shown his strength of character so many times			0
what you want your captain to do is make good choices , do the right things and lead by example			2
@entity13 does all that and he ’s a nice bloke , so playing against him must be so difficult			2
he has respect and his players will see that , which means that they will follow him			0
@entity13 ( centre ) reacts to a decision during @entity0 's victory over @entity27 in november @entity55 : @entity300 has emerged as @entity0 ’s first - choice fly - half , and @entity302 is injured			1
@entity15 , how do you rate the young playmaker who will wear no 10 and the other , who will be missed ? @entity136 : @entity300 is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is a natural in the way he reads the game			2
he works hard and as a young guy he is happy to take on responsibility and shows he can deal with it			0
@entity302 is immensely tough mentally and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than he has been getting for what he has done in the last few years			0
as a young guy , he has dealt with pressure , kicked goals and stood up in defence			0
he came in without much experience but just got on with it			0
@entity0 are lucky to have both those guys			2
@entity300 ( left ) is likely to start as @entity0 's fly half against @entity1 on friday evening @entity302 , kicking a penalty in november 2013 , is out of the @entity3 through injury @entity15 ( left ) and @entity12 columnist sir @entity327 embrace in 2003 @entity55 : @entity13 , which teams are the main threats to your title ambitions in this @entity3 ? @entity63 : i do n’t think we can look much further than that first game in @entity1 , but @entity334 are also playing well and @entity235 were probably the form team coming out of the autumn			1
there wo n’t be any easy games - that ’s why it ’s a great tournament			0
captains ( from left ) @entity342 of @entity37 , @entity343 of @entity169 , @entity13 of @entity0 , @entity344 of @entity235 , @entity31 of @entity1 and @entity345 of @entity334 at the @entity3 launch @entity13 and @entity15 are ambassadors for @entity348 , official beer of @entity0			1
