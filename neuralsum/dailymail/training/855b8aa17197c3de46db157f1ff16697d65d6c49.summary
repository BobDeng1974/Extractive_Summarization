we are having the wrong debate ! all the talk is about @entity3 and the @entity5 captaincy when what we should be urgently discussing is the @entity5 coaching job			1
the role and responsibility of @entity10 needs to be massively increased while the role and identity of the @entity5 cricket captain is a lesser issue			1
@entity16 cricket traditionally lionises the captain and makes him central to everything — @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , may , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity3			1
he should not be the totemic figure any more , that must be the head coach			1
the media scrutiny is infinitely bigger than ever before and that is a problem			2
i ca n’t imagine what it must be like to have every ball and every single decision you make in the course of five days , across a five - @entity61 series minutely scrutinised by @entity62 , @entity26 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity28 , @entity65 , @entity24 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity27 , @entity68 and @entity69 to list just the first dozen @entity72 and @entity73 pundits that come to mind			0
and that ’s before you take into account the minute - by - minute blogging and tweeting			0
the majority of those concerned were captains , some more successful than others , and will argue they had to cope with similar pressures			0
but they did not , not to this extent			0
this is way off the scale			0
an @entity5 cricket captain can now find himself pinned up against the wall for five days — there is no escape , and no right of reply			1
you ca n’t get involved in arguments with media pundits @entity96			2
the result for the @entity5 captain can almost be paralysis by analysis when things are n’t going well			2
it ’s an unprecedented , unrelenting , barrage of expert opinion			0
how can one man out in the middle , under the cosh , compete against that brains trust ? how can it not affect him and wear him down ? the biggest problem of all , however , is how the @entity5 captain still seems to be central to everything when the man in charge must be the coach			1
the captain should have no role in the composition of a team or squad			1
preparation : @entity5 practiced at the @entity119 ahead of the crucial third test against @entity35 netting : @entity5 captain cook is without a century since may 2013 against @entity122 such a system can only be compromised by his relationship with other players			2
nor should there be selectors either , that system is archaic			0
selection must be totally down to the coach			1
why on earth did @entity3 become involved in the @entity133 sacking and exile ? it should have nothing to do with him			1
when i was the @entity5 rugby coach i would consult trusted lieutenants such as @entity139 and @entity140 but i alone always picked the team and squads			1
the captain was n’t consulted although i did sit down with my captains after i had made my decision but before the side was announced			2
i would explain my thinking and we would have a good ‘ grown - up ’ discussion about the team			2
i would never risk @entity152 ’s performance by opening him up to the complications which arise in the selection process			0
the @entity5 cricket coach must start taking total ownership of the team			1
in a five - day test he will , almost by definition , spend 50 per cent of that time in the @entity5 dressing room talking to the players			0
he has great potential to influence tactics in every conceivable way — batting orders , bowling rotations , field settings — and generally lift the mood or dampen euphoria if huge			0
it is his team , yet the captain takes all the heat			1
i ’m looking for @entity10 to step up			1
he is in charge and when the going gets rough the pressure should come on the coach , not the captain			1
during the actual course of a test the first port of call for all the main media interviews every day must be the coach			1
whenever @entity182 play the first voice is always @entity184			0
he is not out there on the pitch but he is definitely in charge and is happy to be held to account			0
the @entity188 should downgrade the captaincy			0
there is so much information now available , how can he process all that and still perform with the bat ? it ’s not quite like football where there is that mentality that you could throw the armband to almost anybody			0
the role of @entity5 cricket captain will always carry greater weight , but it does n’t need to be so central to a team ’s ability to perform			1
it ’s more a hand on the tiller			0
glove work : @entity210 prepares for his @entity61 as he comes in for @entity211 drill : @entity5 bowler @entity212 dives as he practices his fielding while @entity3 watches on many will read this and say ‘ it is what it is ’ , and look at other @entity61 captains and @entity61 teams who are doing just fine			2
indeed , @entity222 , @entity35 ’s captain is a prime example			0
having watched cricket first hand in @entity35 i can tell you he is under huge pressure from fans at home and i greatly admire how he leads his team			1
but that ’s no argument for continuing in the same way , in fact it ’s the opposite			0
in @entity3 we have an outstanding cricketer who i believe can be a great leader			2
we should be asking why this is happening , and then move heaven and earth to remedy the situation ; not simply to dismiss one of our great players and pass the baton on to another who will inevitably become worn down by the same pitfalls .			0

role and responsibility of head coach @entity10 should be increased
too much pressure and *expectancy* placed on captain in *modern* cricket
captain should have no role in team composition or selection
@entity261 should be taking far more of the media burden off @entity3
