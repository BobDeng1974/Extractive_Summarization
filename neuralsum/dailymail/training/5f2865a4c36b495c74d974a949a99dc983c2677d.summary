the use of well - known brand names in school tests has led to accusations that education boards are making product placement deals			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were among the more famous brands to have appeared in a recent @entity13 @entity12 standardized @entity11 test taken by more than a million students in grades three to eight			1
other brands included @entity17 and @entity18			0
outraged parents have demanded an explanation for why specific brand names were used in the tests - with some suggesting they 've become little more than just another way of advertising to young children			1
but @entity13 state education officials and the test publisher insist the brand references were not paid product placement and just happened to be contained in previously published passages selected for the tests			1
little more than an advert : the use of specific brand names in a @entity13 @entity12 standardized @entity11 test has been criticized by parents and pupils in one test scenario , a busboy has to clean up some spilled root beer			1
but rather than just saying ' root beer ' , the exam used the specific brand name ' @entity18 ' some critics claim the use of brand names for whatever reason is still commercializing exams			1
@entity49 , associate director of the @entity50 , said : ' it just seems so unnecessary			0
it would be horrible if they were getting paid for it			2
but even if they 're not , it 's taking something that should not be a commercial experience and commercializing it			0
' the test questions have not been made public and teachers have been barred from discussing them			2
but some have still posted complaints about the tests anonymously on education blogs			2
they said many students were confused by the brand names , which were also accompanied by trademark symbols			1
one mother @entity68 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , claimed her eighth - grade son complained to her about named brands in the test			1
big list : @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity17 were also named in the test which was taken by more than a million children this month in one question a busboy failed to clean some spilled root beer — @entity18 , to be exact , a registered trademark of @entity81			2
she said her son asked : ' why are they trying to sell me something during the test ? ' , adding : ' he 's bright enough to realize that it was almost like a commercial			2
' others claimed @entity6 appeared in a question about being a risk taker and included the line : ' " @entity94 " is a registered trademark of @entity6 '			2
@entity96 , from @entity97 , whose fifth - grader encountered the @entity6 question , said there was apparently no reason for such a specific brand			2
' i 'm sure they could have used a historical figure who took risks and invented things			0
i 'm sure they could have found something other than @entity6 to express their point			0
' the use of brand names was one of several complaints raised by some educators and parents about the statewide tests , aligned to the @entity12 standards intended to increase academic rigor			1
some contend they are too difficult and do n't measure what students are actually learning			0
while such general complaints about @entity12 tests have arisen elsewhere , advocates said the prevalence of brand names appears to be specific to @entity13			1
representatives of the @entity129 and @entity130 , the education publishing giant with a $ 32 million five - year contract to develop @entity13 's tests , said the companies did not pay for the exposure			1
' there are no product placement deals between us , @entity130 or anyone else , ' said @entity140 , an @entity129 spokesman			0
if the author chose to use a brand name in the original , we do n't edit			0
' @entity130 spokesman @entity148 said neither the company nor the education department received any compensation for the mentions			0
and if any brand comes up in a passage , she said , ' the trademark symbol is included in order to follow rights and permission laws and procedures '			0
@entity6 and @entity159 , the maker of @entity17 , said they were unaware they were mentioned on the tests			0
other companies declined to comment or did not return messages			0
branding : @entity6 also appeared in one exam question about taking risks			1
the company said it had no knowledge its name was being used in the test education officials said brand names such as @entity8 , pictured , were only used if they appeared in previously published pages selected for the tests some advertising experts said the idea of product placement on a test is inappropriate and fraught with peril			1
' if any brand did try to place there , what they would lose from the outrage would surely trump any exposure they got , ' said @entity184 , a marketing professor at @entity185			0
@entity186 , a marketing professor at @entity187 , said he is a fan of brands but there are places where they do n't belong			0
' education , religion and civic life are places where brands are unwelcome , ' @entity186 said			0
' it would be wise for @entity130 to avoid using brands in their testing even if they 're not paid for by the brand itself			2
' others endorsed the position of @entity13 state educators — that brand names belong on the tests because they are part of the world students inhabit			1
' brands are part of our lives , ' said @entity214 , managing director of the @entity13 brand consulting firm @entity215			1
' to say they do n't belong in academia is unrealistic			0
