by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 20:46 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 20:46 est , 27 october 2013 a high school student who dressed as a homeless man for a drama assignment was so convincing that he fooled school officials — and ended up getting suspended			1
it began with an assignment last month , senior @entity9 , 17 , said : create a character and be that person for an entire day at @entity12 , just outside @entity13			1
@entity9 hopes to attend the @entity13 next year and is still exploring whether theater and drama are his calling			1
judging by his performance , he could be short - listed			0
good actor : @entity9 , 17 , ( not pictured ) dressed up as a homeless man and went to his school in character			1
the teachers called the police because he was so believable @entity9 said he created a homeless man named @entity25 who had a falling - out with his family after he ran over his younger sister			1
@entity25 was also swayed by a guru to give up all his material possessions			0
‘ i wore like a couple layers of coats and some sweatpants , ’ @entity9 said			1
he added a pair of fingerless gloves , mismatched shoes and plastic bags for socks			1
he also smeared ink on his face to make it look dirty			2
@entity9 usually walks to school , but his mother , @entity43 , thought he looked so much like a homeless person that she drove him and dropped him off early , before the main entrance was open			1
@entity9 went to an alternate entrance , shook the door and attracted the attention of a teacher or hall monitor , who asked what the stranger wanted			1
‘ i had to kind of think on my feet , ’ @entity9 said , since he did n't want to break character before the school day even began			1
‘ i kind of mumbled and said " i need to talk to some people " , ’ @entity9 recalled , adding that in retrospect that might have made officials think he was mentally unbalanced			2
the story : @entity9 ( not pictured ) created a homeless man named @entity25 who had a falling - out with his family after he ran over his younger sister in character : @entity9 went to the @entity12 and shook the front doors wearing his convincing homeless man garb @entity9 said he was stuck between the desire to play his role and the temptation to just tell officials who he was			1
he decided that dropping hints about his identity was ok , because even if adults picked up on them , he could still say he did n't break character			0
‘ at one point , i think i said , " i might be a student here " , ’ and a school official responded , ‘ no , you ca n't be			0
you look like you 're 30 and you have n't showered in 10 days			0
’ he also tried showing them the garbage bag he was carrying , since it contained his school backpack			0
but his attention to character detail thwarted that , too			0
the bag was also filled with empty plastic bottles , and that 's apparently all the officials saw			0
‘ it 's not like this entire time i was n't trying to let them know i was a student , ’ @entity9 said			2
‘ it was pretty funny to me			0
’ then the police showed up			0
after staying in character for a little longer , @entity9 explained the whole situation			2
the police left , and an administrator said he was suspended for insubordination and for breaking a rule that students must identify themselves to an administrator when asked			1
officials at @entity106 said the district ca n't comment on individual discipline			0
@entity9 understands that the school was in an unusual position , but the two - day suspension still stings			2
‘ i definitely think they overreacted , ’ he said			0
but @entity9 's mother said the school was right to be careful , given safety concerns in the wake of recent violent shootings			2
she is n't upset that they suspended her son , adding , ‘ it 's a good school			2
’ when a mumbling stranger carrying a garbage bag shows up at a school , she said , ‘ who knows how it 's going to turn out ? ’			0
