mrs @entity6 said after the sentencing : ‘ i did n’t think for a second about my own safety , i was just really angry that someone had got into my house			1
i was livid and i thought , “ how dare he ? ” ‘ at first when i heard the noise i thought it was one of our neighbours who gets up very early putting his bin out			2
i got up and listened by the window and then put on my housecoat and slippers and went down to see what was happening			0
caught : @entity10 , 25 , was jailed for 16 months at @entity31 after admitting burglary ‘ when i walked into the conservatory it was like a bombsite in there			1
i could n’t see anything missing but someone had helped himself to a couple of handfuls of the suet pellets we give the birds			0
‘ they contain mealworms and insects so i do n’t know what he made of them			0
i went out onto the patio wondering what the hell was going on and i saw a light in the shed			2
‘ i thought , “ there ’s somebody in there ” - so i went quietly down the path			2
i realised the padlock on the door had been forced and was n’t there - the police actually found it in the burglar ’s pocket later			1
‘ but we have an outside bolt at the top of the door so i quickly locked him in			2
he realised he was in trouble because he started rattling the door but he never said a word and neither did i. ‘ i went back into the house and woke my husband and he went out with a big torch and shone it through the shed window			1
he could see the man crouched down on the floor with his hoodie up			1
‘ @entity14 stood against the door to prevent the man trying to force it open and i called the police			1
it was quite comical when they arrived			2
‘ one of the officers opened the shed door and said “ all right buddy , who are you then ? ” i heard a little voice say “ @entity10 ”			1
the policeman said " @entity10 who ? " and the man said " @entity10 "			1
’ ' i did n’t think for a second about my own safety , i was just really angry that someone had got into my house			0
i was livid and i thought , " how dare he ? " ' @entity6 mrs @entity6 said she and her husband found later that @entity10 had also tried to get into their motorhome , which is parked up against the front of the shed			1
she added : ‘ it was quite funny when the policeman asked me “ did you have some @entity29 ice creams in your freezer ? ” i said " yes " and he told me “ well , he ’s eaten them all ”			0
‘ it was only much later that i thought about the risk i ’d taken			0
my husband asked me why i did n’t wake him - and he said he would never have done what i did			0
’ bizarre : mrs @entity6 in her conservatory , where @entity10 ate some of her bird food before breaking into the shed - where she bolted him in praising mrs @entity6 ’s bravery , judge @entity143 ordered that she be paid a £ 250 reward by the high sheriff of @entity8			1
the judge told @entity10 : ‘ this was a night time burglary of an occupied house and you were caught because of the very brave and commendable behaviour of the lady of the house			1
‘ at great risk to herself she went in pursuit of you across the garden to the shed and locked you in			0
you were only caught because of what she did			0
’ in a citation to the @entity146 , the judge added : ‘ she could see a light in the shed but she had no idea what the nature of that person was in the dark			0
‘ she went over to the shed and coolly locked the top bolt and detained the defendant inside			0
‘ that deserves to be marked by a commendation from me and a reward of £ 250 for her public spirited and brave actions which have led to a repeat offender being imprisoned			0
’ in court , prosecutor @entity177 praised mrs @entity6 ’s ‘ fortitude and clear thinking			2
’ ‘ when the defendant was interviewed he said he had no recollection of events at all due to his taking of illicit drugs , ’ mr @entity177 said			0

he also had other previous burglary convictions			0
hungry burglar : officers arrived minutes later to find @entity10 on the floor of the shed after eating three @entity29 ice creams ( file pictures ) from mrs @entity6 's freezer @entity201 , defending , said : ‘ he has a long history of drug abuse			1
on this night he had taken @entity204 ( @entity204 ) , which appears to be the drug of choice at the moment in the @entity209			0
‘ he had injected it that night and has a consequence has very little recollection of the offence			0
he can only assume he did it because he wanted somewhere to sleep			0
it explains his odd behavour and his eating			0
