the former head of the @entity1 this morning launched an extraordinary public attack on @entity3 for being the only party not to commit to an extra £ 8billion a year for the health service			1
sir @entity6 said it was crucial that all the main political parties backed the @entity1 ’s five - year plan , which calls for a 7 per cent boost to the health budget by 2020			1
@entity12 and @entity13 have pledged to find the cash – but @entity15 has refused			0
warning : sir @entity6 , the retired head of @entity16 , has warned of a ' substantial financial problem ' at the heart of the @entity1 and says it is being ignored by politicians speaking this morning , sir @entity6 said : ‘ that £ 8billion needs to be available and all of the parties but @entity3 have signed up			1
but it ’s important we get all the parties signed up			0
i think it will be helpful for the @entity1 if @entity3 agree to sign it			1
’ sir @entity6 said it was vital for the @entity1 for there to be a ‘ political consensus ’ guaranteeing its budget			1
he said once the @entity1 knew what its budget was going to be it could start tackling the growing black hole in its finances			1
‘ they must make sure we are not building on sand but on a stable financial base , ' he said			0
health secretary @entity39 this morning weighed in behind sir @entity6 - admitting that the @entity1 faced ' a significant financial challenge over the next @entity41 '			1
but he said : ' that ’s why we have committed to finding at least an extra £ 8billion a year by 2020			0
this is the amount , @entity43 the current chief executive of the @entity1 said the service would need			2
' mr @entity39 added : ' @entity3 must explain why they wo n't find the money the @entity1 says it needs			1
' deputy prime minister @entity13 also backed sir @entity6 's remarks			1
he said : ' the @entity1 does need more money			2
now , it ’s @entity6 ’s successor , as it happens , @entity43 identified this number : £ 8billion by the end of the next parliament			2
' he and @entity6 are quite right to expect political parties to explain how they ’re going to come up with that money			2
' deputy prime minister @entity13 , appearing this morning on @entity56 , backed sir @entity6 's intervention sir @entity6 's intervention came after @entity58 , leading @entity59 and chair of the @entity61 also laid into @entity3			1
he said : ‘ the @entity1 will be extremely worried by the lack of political consensus around the £ 8billion funding for the @entity1 ’ five - year plan			2
' @entity1 leaders have been clear that this is the minimum amount needed to maintain current service provision			1
' it ’s not rocket - science to predict the impact on the @entity1 if this commitment is not met : patients would face longer waits , services would face severe cuts and rationing , and many hospitals and gp practices would struggle to survive in their current form			2
’ sir @entity6 accused politicians of ignoring a black hole in the @entity1 budget to boost their election chances			1
he warned that there was a ' substantial financial problem ' at the heart of the @entity1 and claimed the financial peril it faces will soon be ' crystal clear '			1
the former @entity1 chief said that politicians were talking about spending more money rather than addressing existing funding gaps			2
sir @entity6 was called the man with no shame after he refused to resign over the @entity96 scandal and retired with a gold - plated pension last year			1
before he left the @entity1 he spoke of his ' bitter regret ' over not speaking to affected patients and their families during the @entity95 , where 1,200 died , but he refused to quit			1
@entity12 was back on a building site yesterday , while @entity15 was pictured outside the @entity102 in central @entity103 sir @entity6 has worked in the @entity1 since 1977 , the same year he joined the @entity104			1
after working in mental health for a decade , he rose through the ranks to become chief executive of several bodies including the @entity109 and @entity110 at the time of the care scandal in which up to 1,200 people died			2
in 2006 he became chief executive of the whole of the @entity1 , in charge of a £ 90billion budget and 1.3million staff			2
he claimed £ 50,000 - a - year in expenses on top of a salary of his £ 211,000 salary , £ 20,000 bonus and around £ 47,000 of ' benefits in kind '			0
the package was criticised at a time when his ' @entity128 ' was imposing £ 20billion in efficiency savings on the @entity1			2
he insisted he had to travel by first - class to do his job , but refused to explain to mps why his expense claims included 41 first - class trips to @entity135 , where his 35 - year - old wife lives with their baby daughter			0
he was also accused of overseeing a culture of fear within the @entity1 where hospitals fiddle their figures and whistleblowers are prevented from speaking out			2
in a three - year period under his rule a total of £ 14.7 million was spent on almost 600 ' compromise agreements ' preventing ex-employees from speaking out			0
a year after his retirement he has re-emerged to warn of problems with the @entity1 ' finances			0
he told the @entity102 : '' i have not heard in most of the conversations politicians are having at the moment about what they 're going to do about that financial hole			0
' they want to talk about extra services and extra investment when actually there is a problem there to face			0
' the former head of @entity16 also cast doubt on @entity167 and @entity168 plans to fund the health service			0
sir @entity6 said the so - called ' @entity43 plan ' both parties have signed up to , which involves the government injecting £ 8 billion cash into the @entity1 while gaining £ 22 billion from efficiency savings , will be difficult to implement			1
@entity3 is the only main party which has not signed up to the five - year plan drawn up by current @entity16 chief executive @entity43 , instead favouring a £ 2.5 billion @entity176 to care fund paid for by a mansion tax and tobacco levies			2
sir @entity6 told @entity181 's today programme : ' what the public is being told at the moment is that ' we 'll give you a bit of extra money and everything will be fine ' and that actually these managers can deliver £ 22 billion and then everything will be fine			1
' so in a sense if they find it difficult to do that and i think most of them will , i think they are going to be blamed			0
' sir @entity6 launched ' @entity6 's challenge ' in 2009 , when he ran @entity16 , and urged staff to find £ 20billion in ' efficiency savings ' by 2015 - but it failed			1
he says the situation today is similarly grave and warned that the @entity1 will have to take ' emergency action ' such as freezing recruitment			0
savings could mean that patients could be forced to wait longer waits for treatment , more expensive drugs may not be used and it will be even harder to see a gp			0
sir @entity6 was one of the most criticised civil servants of recent times when he was the £ 211,000 - a - year head of @entity16			1
in that period he defied calls to resign from mps and campaigners over his role in the @entity219 scandal , where hundreds died through neglect			0
relatives described how elderly patients became so thirsty they resorted to drinking dirty water from vases , while nurses said they left wards in tears because care was so poor			0
sir @entity6 was accused of not taking action while in charge of the regional health body overseeing the trust , and later when appointed @entity1 chief executive in 2006			1
in fact at the height of the scandal , in october 2005 , he toured the hospital wards and wrote a glowing letter to managers praising them for hitting targets			0
but he has repeatedly insisted that at the time he had ' no idea ' of the unfolding scandal and maintained that the failings were ' system wide '			0
he came under further pressure when it emerged he had ignored the concerns of two whistleblowers about another trust , @entity251 , where 670 patients may have died needlessly			0
sir @entity6 became known as the ' man with no shame ' because of his stance over the scandals and his pension pot is likely to be more than £ 2million			1
he said last night : ' other people will make judgements about my record			0
i think i made a contribution to improving services			0
but obviously i regret people suffered			0
i regret patients did not get the best possible care			0

sir @entity6 called on @entity3 to commit to spending extra on @entity1
he said the @entity1 has a ' substantial financial problem ' which needs sorting
the former head of @entity1 says black hole will be ' crystal clear ' after election
sir @entity6 was called the ' @entity278 ' for refusing to quit his job
1,200 died because of poor care in @entity282 while he ran regional body
