‘ the pain was like a constant burning sensation , ' said @entity2 of his left leg after years of worsening pain in his left leg , 63 - year - old @entity2 was facing the last resort : amputation			1
he was on the verge of becoming one of the thousands of people who have a limb amputated every year due to ‘ diabetic foot ’			1
the condition , which results in 100 foot amputations every week in the @entity17 , occurs when blood vessels in the lower limbs are so badly clogged up and damaged that the feet are starved of blood			2
this can lead to infection and even gangrene , where loss of blood supply causes tissue to die			0
@entity2 first experienced pain in his left leg in 1994 , after being diagnosed aged 23 with type 1 diabetes			1
with type 1 diabetes , the body does n’t produce insulin , the hormone that mops up glucose from the bloodstream ( type 2 is where patients do n’t produce sufficient insulin )			1
as @entity2 ’s condition deteriorated , walking became a struggle and eventually he needed a wheelchair			1
then , in 2006 , a 3cm - wide weeping ulcer appeared on his left shin			1
doctors tried treating it with antibiotics but it would n’t heal			2
by late 2009 , with blood supply to his lower leg practically non-existent , @entity2 ’s doctors thought amputation was his only option			1
‘ the pain was like a constant burning sensation , ’ says @entity2 , from @entity55 , @entity56 , a father - of - three who is a warranty administrator with a car dealership			1
‘ i was on morphine - based painkillers to help try to numb it , but they were not strong enough			2
i would have said “ yes ” to amputation right there and then to stop the pain , ’ he adds			1
diabetes can lead to a particularly aggressive form of atherosclerosis , the condition where arteries become clogged with fatty substances			2
high levels of glucose damage the lining of the blood vessels , as well as increasing the build - up of fatty deposits			2
in diabetes , the smaller blood vessels below the knee and in the foot are particularly prone to this			1
as a result they narrow , becoming blocked and preventing blood — and oxygen — reaching the lower legs			0
the nerves are also damaged			0
as these help control blood flow , this can worsen symptoms			0
and because these nerves also convey sensation , the feet can become numb			0
poor circulation can also lead to the skin on the feet becoming dry and breaking easily			0
all of this means that the tiniest bump , or something as innocuous as a shoe rubbing against the skin , can cause a small cut , which can develop into an ulcer			0
the nerve damage and lack of sensation means patients often do n’t know they have an ulcer until it has become established			0
poor blood flow exacerbates the problem — the lack of oxygen and molecules crucial for repair mean injuries are less likely to heal , if at all			0
@entity2 is delighted he was able to access the specialist treatment at the diabetic foot clinic weeping wounds can easily become infected and , in the worst cases , this leads to gangrene			1
in severe cases , amputation is the only option to prevent sepsis			1
even diabetics who successfully manage their condition for years can eventually fall victim to diabetic foot , as with age the arteries naturally begin to harden and narrow			1
taking aspirin and statins can help prevent diabetic atherosclerosis progressing but for diabetic foot there has been no ‘ cure ’ , which is why there are so many amputations			1
@entity2 was fortunate to avoid this drastic option			1
in late 2009 , after he ’d been referred to a specialist amputation unit , his wife , @entity142 , came across a @entity144 article about a multi ‑ disciplinary diabetic foot clinic at @entity146 , @entity147			1
patients facing amputation usually have many foot problems which require specialists to work together to save the foot			1
these patients are having a ‘ foot attack ’ and need immediate co-ordinated care , in a similar way to heart attack and stroke patients			2
although his gp had not heard about this foot clinic , he agreed to refer @entity2			1
the clinic is run by professor @entity163 , a diabetes specialist , and the team consists of a range of specialists including vascular surgeons , orthopaedic surgeons , chiropodists , podiatrists and radiologists			1
a key part of their approach is using interventional radiology ( @entity176 ) to help unblock the damaged arteries and restore blood supply to the stricken limb			0
guided by imaging techniques such as x-ray , ct scans and ultrasound , specialists insert tiny wires through the blood vessels to the damaged arteries			2
a tiny balloon is then inserted into the artery and inflated , squashing the fatty deposits and clearing the blockage			0
the artery is then held open with a metal tube , or stent			0
the technique , known as balloon angioplasty , is widely used for treating blocked arteries to the heart			0
figures from the @entity197 published in 2011 suggest the technique has a 96 per cent success rate — meaning the blood vessels in the leg remain open — in the first year			2
the team discovered @entity2 ’s problems were caused by blockages in an artery in his left thigh and in arteries below his knee			1
within four weeks he was undergoing treatment			0
first , he had a balloon angioplasty performed by an interventional radiologist			0
a vascular surgeon then performed a bypass of the blockage in the arteries in his calf			2
again , in a technique more widely used for blocked arteries to the heart , the blood flow is redirected around an obstruction using a piece of vein taken from elsewhere , usually from the thigh			0
‘ now i do n’t even need crutches , ' said @entity2 ( pictured with wife @entity142 ) @entity2 needed both procedures to increase the blood flow enough to help his lower leg heal			1
he also had a skin graft for his ulcer			0
finally , doctors decided it was necessary to amputate one of the toes on his left foot			1
‘ there was such severe ulceration and infection that it would put the rest of my leg at risk — but this was a small price to pay if my leg could be saved , ’ he said			2
most patients take three to 12 months to fully heal			0
three months later , @entity2 was pain - free : walking , driving and back at work			1
he has since been monitored regularly			0
a couple of years later , the team found the blood flow in his leg had decreased again due to further narrowing of the artery — the continuing effects of diabetic atherosclerosis			1
however , according to a study published in the journal @entity254 , up to 80 per cent of patients do n’t need any further interventions for five years			0
another angioplasty tackled @entity2 ’s blockage			1
he still has regular ultrasound examinations to check his blood flow			0
professor @entity261 , who highlighted @entity2 ’s case at the recent @entity264 conference in @entity265 , wants to see more specialist units across the country to reduce the alarming number of people who lose limbs to diabetic foot			1
he believes that in the long run it will save the @entity274 millions of pounds			0
latest estimates state that the cost of caring for patients with diabetic ulcers or diabetic amputees was up to £ 662 million per year in @entity280 alone			2
ulcer care alone is estimated to be £ 219 million each year , while amputation care is £ 55 million			2
‘ it is widely recognised that using vascular bypass and interventional radiology to combat diabetic foot is a much cheaper option than amputation , ’ says professor @entity261			1
‘ amputations should not happen because the problems are detectable and potentially treatable			0
’ he says teams similar to his own should be located at every hospital : ‘ clinical and economic studies indicate that multi-disciplinary foot clinics can improve patient outcomes and make savings that exceed the cost of the team			2
’ the proportion of hospital beds occupied by a patient with diabetes his views are echoed by interventional radiologist dr @entity306 , who works at the @entity307 in the @entity308			0
‘ the majority of patients suffering from diabetic foot are elderly and unwell , ’ he says			1
‘ anything that means they avoid general surgery under general anaesthetic has got to be welcomed and that ’s why the non-invasive methods we use in @entity176 have a high success rate			0
' most patients have this done as a day procedure under local anaesthetic			0
’ @entity2 is delighted he was able to access this specialist treatment			2
‘ if i ’d ended up with a prosthesis , i would have taken months to get mobile , which would have affected my work , ’ he says			0
‘ now i do n’t even need crutches , and i ’m back behind the wheel after being unable to drive for four years			0
‘ the difference between how i was and how i am now is like night and day			0
