football fans have always found cutting ways to mock the tastes and foibles of their rivals , usually through clever songs and chants			1
but how much do they actually know about those who stand on the other side of the fence ? what do they buy ? what do they watch and listen to ? how do they vote ? what makes them tick ? well , a detailed survey of over 200,000 people by pollsters @entity17 could hold the answers			1
they have pulled together a searchable database that tells you the favourite food , hobbies , personality , fashion tastes , car preference , @entity28 follow list and general favourite things of football fans			1
and , it 's fair to say , some of the results are pretty illuminating			2
here 's a cross-section of just some of the clubs featured			0

@entity49 fans are funny ... but like wearing lots of beauty products @entity44 fans like watching @entity123 and love a bargain there 's some pretty dubious tv tastes in this survey but @entity44 fans surely top the list with the @entity131 and @entity133 's @entity132			1

@entity52 fans like to keep up with the local news - with @entity174 among their favourite tv shows and the @entity176 bookmarked on their browsers			1
@entity52 fans are good company , especially over a pint , but can sometimes by grumpy @entity180 fans are @entity181 , right - wing and like boxing ( and butter ) @entity180 supporters tend to be pre-judged more than most and the survey does seem to support many of the common preconceptions			1

on the plus side , they have plenty of spare cash and dress in @entity198			0
