hunched in their snow burrows , @entity1 's mountain hares brave some of the harshest conditions our island can throw at them			1
and for the past three years , photographer @entity6 has shared the freezing temperatures , blizzards and snow storms with them , often lying in the snow for hours to capture incredible images of the typically timid animals			1
the 43 - year - old , who also acts as a mountain guide , says the hares are one of @entity1 's truly native creatures , having been here since the last ice age			1
' this day in particular , a few weeks ago , was the hardest i 've experienced to date			0
' it was persistent blizzards for most of the day and at times i was wading up to my chest through snow drifts			2
' mountain hares have to endure some of the harshest conditions found in the @entity1			1
i try to photograph the mountain hares at least once a fortnight throughout the year , this way i can capture their lives in all types of weather conditions they have to endure , even the severest winter storms			1
' photographer @entity6 has braved blizzards and icy temperatures to capture these incredible images of the typically timid animals in their natural habitat @entity6 has spent three years capturing the stunning photographs as part of the @entity57 of the @entity59 project @entity6 has one particular hare that he has known for the past three years which is more than happy to have his picture taken			1
' it 's not unusual for me to spend four or five hours with my favourite hare			0
in fact i find if i talk to him he relaxes more and at times he has even fallen asleep in front of me			0
no wild animal would do this if it was n't totally relaxed in your presence ' as part of @entity6 's ongoing photographic project with the @entity72 of the @entity59 he paid repeat visits to the same mountain hare over a 23 day period			1
in these series of images you can see the hare 's coat ( pelage ) morphing from its brown summer colour to its thick white winter coat			0
as it happens , this occurred just in the nick of time as the first heavy snow fall of the winter came a few days later			0
mountain hares are indigenous to @entity1 having survived from the last ice age			1
they are now rarely found in the @entity1 below 500m			2
they are also spread across @entity91 , from @entity92 to @entity93			0
smaller than the more common @entity91 hare , the species adapted to live in polar and mountainous habitats			0
during the winter months , their fur changes from brown to white to help camouflage among the snow and avoid predators such as eagles and foxes			0
the hares are also hunted for sport as small game and have been subject to culling because they allegedly carried a tick borne virus which can kill grouse chicks			0
exact numbers of mountain hares in @entity114 are unknown by research by the @entity116 found local populations had fallen by 43 per cent since 1995			1
@entity6 added : ' in winter they are almost completely white and through the spring they moult , become a mottled brown and white colour and in summer they are brown a grey twinge , the grey colour can look like a shade of blue , in fact in the @entity27 they are often referred to as blue hares			2
' @entity57 hares are one of only a few truly native species of mammals found in the @entity1			1
' they have survived from the last ice age			1
they live in the high mountains of @entity114 and prosper on well managed grouse moors , which in turn brings them into conflict with the grouse shooting fraternity as it 's believed they pass on blood sucking ticks on to young grouse			2
' @entity57 hares spend all year exposed to all elements and in winter move to the more sheltered leeward sides of the mountains			0
' unlike rabbits , hares do n't burrow but live in shallow scrapes called forms			0
in the winter months hares are often completely covered in snow with just their heads visible above the snow , the snow acts as insulation against the bitter winds which can reach as low as minus forty with the wind chill			2
' @entity6 spends most of his time photographing and guiding other wildlife photographers in the @entity59 of @entity114			1
he added : ' mountain hare photography takes a lot of patience as hares will often sit for hours without moving , it can also take up to two hours to get close enough to take a picture due to their timid nature			2
' after all their latin name is @entity172			0
' good field craft and a solid understanding of their behaviour is essential to be a successful hare photographer			0
also as important is layers of thermals and down jackets to stay dry and warm			0
' the mountain hares ' coat changes colour in the winter from brown to white to match its snowy surroundings			1
