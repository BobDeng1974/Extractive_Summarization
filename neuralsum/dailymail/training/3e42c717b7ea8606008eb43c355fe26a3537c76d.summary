by @entity0 to all those who remember the days of @entity3 and @entity5 ’s hobnobbing with celebrities , it is a party with a very familiar feel			1
but tonight ’s knees - up for the world of entertainment hosted at the @entity11 by @entity12 is not , insists culture secretary @entity13 , simply a repeat of mr @entity5 ’s much - mocked 1997 reception at @entity16			1
mr @entity13 was adamant last night that it was an important event to thank the creative industries for their ‘ staggering ’ success in boosting the @entity21 economy by £ 71billion a year			1
tonight ¿ s knees - up for the world of entertainment hosted at the @entity11 by @entity12 is not , insists culture secretary @entity13 , simply a repeat of mr @entity5 's much - mocked 1997 reception at @entity16 around 200 guests from the world of arts and entertainment are expected to attend , including @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity33 creator @entity32			1
@entity34 and @entity35 , who run @entity36 which made @entity37 , are attending ; as is @entity38 , chairman and chief executive of @entity40			0
@entity41 , president and managing director of @entity43 @entity21 , @entity44 and @entity45 and a governor of the @entity47 is also expected to attend			2
@entity49 star @entity48 and @entity51 actor @entity50 have been invited			1
@entity53 ( then @entity52 ) arrives at the much - mocked 1997 reception at @entity16 , with ex-partner @entity55 @entity5 was mocked for hosting a ' @entity3 ' party in 1997 , attended by celebrities including @entity59 lead singer @entity58 actors dame @entity61 and @entity62 , along with television presenters @entity63 , @entity65 and @entity66 , were tipped to attend			1
a select group of around a dozen will then go on to @entity16 for a dinner			2
in an article published today on @entity71 , mr @entity13 said : ‘ it is not a showbiz party , or an attempt to bask in reflected glory and coolness			0
' it ’s an opportunity to thank and encourage the sector , underline our support for the industry , and to remind investors that , from @entity83 to the @entity84 , the @entity21 is very much the centre of the creative universe			1
’ mr @entity13 said the government ’s tax breaks were behind the success , as he pledged new policies in the coming weeks to boost the culture industry even further			2
in the time it takes you to reads this article , one particular sector of the @entity21 economy will generate almost £ 700,000			2
it ’s a sector that directly employs 1.7 million people , exports to almost every country in the world and , even in a time of strong recovery , is growing three times faster than the rest of the economy			1
our creative industries – which include film , tv , theatre , music and video games – are worth a staggering £ 71 billion each year			1
whether it ’s @entity114 , @entity33 or @entity115 , the @entity21 punches well above its weight , consistently producing the music people want to hear , the programmes they want to see and the games they want to play			0
even for productions that originate elsewhere , the @entity21 has become the go - to destination			0
the new star wars trilogy is set in a galaxy far , far away , yet it is being made at @entity128 ’s @entity127			0
@entity129 and @entity130 may have looked like they were weightless and out of control thousands of feet above the ground , but the @entity136 - winning effects that put them there were created in a down - to - earth office in @entity139			0
@entity33 creator @entity32 and superstar singer @entity140 are expected to attend tomorrow night 's ' @entity3 2 ' party and this is n’t just a @entity128 phenomenon			2
as @entity146 saw this week , @entity145 ’ @entity144 is n’t in the mythical city of @entity144 – it ’s on a soundstage in the middle of @entity151			0
the show supports literally thousands of jobs across @entity44 and pumps around £ 100 million a year into the local economy			1
meanwhile the producer of @entity156 is currently on location in south @entity158 working on the latest series of @entity160			0
and the new tv adaptation of the @entity163 books has just finished filming at sites across @entity165			0
@entity166 , the @entity167 author behind @entity163 , set her novel in the @entity169 after seeing an old episode of dr who – which is , of course , another of @entity21 ’s great creative exports			0
this success of our creative industries is down to the hard work , dedication and sheer talent of @entity21 ’s creatives			0
but the environment in which they have recently flourished was created by the government			0
tax relief for the film , tv , animation and video game sectors has directly led to private sector investment worth hundreds of millions of pounds			0
in the last three years , employment within the creative industries has grown at five times the rate of the wider economy , and we ’re investing more than £ 20 million in skills and training to back those who want to work hard and get on and to ensure there ’s enough new talent in the pipeline			1
as part of our long - term economic plan , we ’ll shortly be setting out an ambitious new strategy to double the value of creative industry exports to £ 31 billion , while also increasing the value of inward investment in creative @entity21 businesses			1
this government ’s commitment to the creative industries will be the focus on monday when the prime minister hosts a reception for some of the sector ’s leading figures			2
it ’s not a showbiz party , or an attempt to bask in reflected glory and coolness			0
it ’s an opportunity to thank and encourage the sector , underline our support for the industry , and to remind investors around the world that , from @entity230 to the @entity231 , via @entity83 and the @entity84 , the @entity21 is very much the centre of the creative universe .			1

will not be repeat of @entity5 ’s mocked 1997 @entity16 reception
is a ' thank you ' to creative industry for boosting economy by £ 71bn a year
