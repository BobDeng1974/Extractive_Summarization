after @entity1 announced a vast reduction in season ticket prices earlier this week , manager @entity0 has labelled the move the best business by any @entity7 club in a long time			1
ahead of their relocation to the @entity9 in a year ’s time , the @entity1 became the first club to drop the price of their season tickets off the back of the @entity7 ’s record three - year , £ 5.13bn television deal , which comes into effect at the start of the 2016 - 17 season			1
@entity1 ’s cheapest adult season ticket for that campaign will cost £ 289 – a considerable saving on the £ 620 equivalent this season			2
and @entity0 feels this is a shrewd business decision by the club , as maintaining a capacity crowd at their new 54,000 - seat @entity28 home will be important for @entity1			2
manager @entity0 has said that filling the stadium is the most important thing for any football club @entity1 became the first @entity7 club to reduce season ticket prices for fans ‘ what we ’ve announced has to be the best piece of business , for me , seen in the @entity7 for a long , long time , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ the most important thing at a football club is to fill the stadium			0
‘ obviously it ’s not from a revenue base like it used to be			0
the revenue base for a football club used to be the sustainability of the club in my years before the @entity7 and before @entity50 made it a worldwide brand			2
@entity1 's season tickets will cost as little as £ 289 when the club move to the @entity9 next year an artist 's impression of what the @entity9 will look like during a @entity1 match ' it ’s about creating the atmosphere in a stadium that thrills not only the fans there , but the players who respond to that			1
‘ i think we keep demanding too much financially from the fan			0
and i think , when you look at where the country has come from since 2008 , people are working harder and longer for less			0
‘ we have to take in mind where they are , and while our money has increased from a revenue point of view , it would be very light - heartening to see that benefit going back to the actual fans who come and watch			0

@entity1 became first @entity7 club to drop prices since tv deal
manager @entity0 believes it 's the best business done in a long time
the @entity1 move into the @entity9 in 2016
