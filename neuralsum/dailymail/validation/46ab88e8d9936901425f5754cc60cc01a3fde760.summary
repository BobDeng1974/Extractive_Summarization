after feasting on too many fermented crabapples , a drunk squirrel has been filmed struggling to escape a snowy @entity3 backyard			1
its torment begins when he takes a tumble off a tall tree he would usually traverse so gracefully			0
at first , the cameraman thinks the animal has hurt itself in the fall but soon realises it simply ca n't hold his crabapple			0
misery : the squirrel 's problems begin when it falls from a tall tree into a snowy back garden in @entity3 fall : at first , the cameraman thinks the animal is hut but soon realises the small rodent is simply drunk daunting : the drunk squirrel eyes up the challenge ahead - a small mound of snow between him and an open fence his next great challenge is the small mound of snow between him and the open fence in an @entity3 backyard - a simple task made very difficult by his inebriated state			1
several attempts to charge up the hill end in failure - leaving the resilient rodent lying flat on his back gazing up at the branches he fell from earlier			0
he seems to have found a solution to his never - ending escape attempt when he targets a different region of the snow to the left - but several more attempts also end in failure			2
in a sober state , the squirrel may simply have strolled around the fence which ended just a few feet to the right			0
the shaky footage has gone viral since being uploaded to @entity56 and @entity57 where it has already gained tens of thousands of hits			1
after a few minutes of persistent climbing , the squirrel finally reaches the top of the tiny expanse of snow and rushes home - presumably to get some rest			2
persistent : the little animal continuously charges at the small mound of snow but always ends up flat on his back escape : finally , after minutes of continuous jumping - much of it on the spot - it reaches the fence it could simply have walked around freedom : with a similar lack of grace , the squirrel darts through the fence and up a slightly easier hill			1
