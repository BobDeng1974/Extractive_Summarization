beginning in the ' @entity10 ' bar of the @entity11 , the melee resulted in the arrest of three men , with two reported broken noses and ten police being called to cart off the angry fitness enthusiasts			1
with witnesses claiming the scene was more like the @entity22 of @entity23 at 3am than a @entity25 society that costs $ 8,500 to join , the hierarchy at the club were unsurprisingly mortified			1

the witness wrote : ‘ it was the best fight i 've ever seen			0
young people , old people , girls , members , non-members , it was a nondiscriminatory ragematch ’			2
' not sure the reason but it seemed to be over a girl			0
' anyway , probably two broken noses right off the back , one dude knocked straight on his butt on the first punch , glasses thrown , broken glass everywhere , and all the tables turned over or shoved to the side , they were making their arena			0
' the commotion ended so everyone thought , until somebody knocked the guy 's girlfriend over and this kid laid one dude right out			0
' girl got knocked over again ... ... second stoppage occurred after a good five minutes when @entity72 the bartender joined forces to come in and stop it			0
@entity74 , @entity72 fell like a bag of sand after a fairly aggressive push and he started screaming ' call nine eleven ' with no word on why the fight broke out , the club apparently had to deal with ' glasses thrown ' around the room and a woman cut badly enough to require stitches			2
