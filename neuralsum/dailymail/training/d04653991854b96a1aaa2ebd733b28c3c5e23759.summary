they must have heard the girls screaming and went over to help			1
' i did n’t hear or see it happen , but a boy aged about ten in this family group ran to get me and said " two girls have been buried in an avalanche "			1
' i raced over to help these two other men			1
we were all digging at the sand with our hands to get them out			2
' i had a little spade with me , but i did n’t want to risk using it in case i injured them			2
it was a difficult job because more sand was pouring down the cliff as we dug the sand out from around them			1

we were all drawing out the sand with our bare hands			0
' it felt a long while when i kept digging and the sand kept collapsing in			0
i just put my two hands together and kept scooping it out			0
' they were very lucky they did n’t get completely buried or nobody would have seen them			0
' mr @entity18 said the girls appeared ‘ deeply shocked ’ , but had no other apparent injury			1
