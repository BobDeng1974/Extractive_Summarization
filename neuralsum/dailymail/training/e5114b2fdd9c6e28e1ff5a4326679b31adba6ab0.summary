@entity0 chipped in with 13 points as @entity2 got back to winning ways in the @entity4 with a 23 - 14 triumph over @entity6			1
former @entity7 international @entity0 converted tries from @entity9 and @entity10 , as well as splitting the posts with two penalties and knocking over a drop goal			1
it was the @entity6 who drew first blood , with @entity17 scoring the first try after 34 minutes , before @entity2 took control and @entity21 's 74th - minute touchdown came too little too late			1
@entity0 kicked 13 points with the boot as @entity2 beat the @entity6 23 - 14 at @entity23 @entity0 's final penalty denied @entity6 a bonus point they might well have deserved			1
the visitors dominated in the first quarter , using strong - running @entity28 to good effect in the centre , but they found the @entity2 defence in combative mood			0
at the other end there was an anxious moment when @entity36 and @entity17 let the ball bounce between them but @entity10 could not quite take advantage			2
@entity2 's own aggressive defensive effort came at the cost of infringements but @entity6 fly - half @entity43 missed two very kickable penalty chances in as many minutes around the quarter - hour			1
@entity6 's problems were chiefly in the scrum and @entity2 cashed in by forcing two penalties themselves - and another from the resulting catch - and - drive , with the unrelenting pressure eventually bringing a 27th - minute drop goal for @entity0			1
lock @entity54 claimed a try from a line - out drive soon after but the tv match official advised he had been held up			0
@entity10 dives over to score one of @entity2 's two tries at @entity23 against the @entity6 on saturday although the @entity6 scrum was driven into touch , they retained the put - in at the line - out and this time the catch - and - drive worked perfectly for @entity17 to get the touchdown			1
@entity43 's conversion was good and the visitors led 7 - 3			0
there was still five minutes to play before the break , however , and @entity2 showed how effective their own maul could be when @entity71 caught at the tail and @entity9 manoeuvred his way over			2
@entity0 converted to send @entity2 in 10 - 7 ahead			2
soon after the restart , @entity74 combined with the whole @entity2 front row as @entity77 broke clear but @entity9 was hauled down and the attack was snuffed out by the scrambling @entity6 ' defence			1
they had to be alert again to deny @entity81 in the right corner after @entity2 switched play from left to right , finally bringing their wings into play			0
on 53 minutes , @entity81 surged down the touchline breaking a tackle and , for once , the ball was swiftly away from the ruck			0
it still needed @entity10 's searing pace though , as the @entity92 centre carved through to the line , with @entity0 converting			0
@entity94 ( right ) of @entity6 attempts to break through the tackle of @entity2 's @entity96 one of the biggest cheers from the crowd of nearly 13,000 was for the appearance off the @entity2 bench of back row @entity101 for his first appearance of the season following ankle surgery			2
there had been very little seen of the @entity6 attack in the second half and a succession of penalties brought an inevitable yellow card for @entity43			0
@entity0 kicked the 65th - minute penalty for a 20 - 7 lead			0
that finally brought a response from the visitors and the charging @entity117 was halted from a tapped penalty before @entity119 burrowed over the line in the other corner			0
to his dismay , the @entity122 again ruled the ball had not been grounded but his side mauled away for nearly five minutes before winger @entity21 was credited with the try			0
@entity2 finished on the attack , winning a penalty at a five - metre scrum and @entity0 denied @entity6 a bonus point .			1
