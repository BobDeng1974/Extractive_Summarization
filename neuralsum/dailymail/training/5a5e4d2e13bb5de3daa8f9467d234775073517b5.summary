by @entity1 reporter published : 12:13 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 28 august 2013 hoping to help : the hospital 's attorney @entity3 , who is also a registered nurse , would be granted the right to make @entity7 's medical decisions if the appeal is granted an appeals court in @entity10 has sided with a hospital that 's seeking to force a 10 - year - old @entity13 girl to resume chemotherapy after her parents decided to stop the treatments			1
the decision issued tuesday sends the case back to a county judge and says he must give more consideration to the request by @entity22			0
the judge had ruled in july that parents @entity24 and @entity26 had the right to make medical decisions for their daughter @entity29 , who has leukemia			1
the hospital wants registered nurse @entity3 , who is also an attorney , to take over limited guardianship and make medical decisions for the girl			0
the hospital says the girl will die without chemotherapy			2
the girl 's parents say that the chemotherapy 's effects were terrible and that they 're now using ' natural ' medicines , such as herbs and vitamins , and consulting with another doctor			2
@entity29 's parents brought her to @entity22 in @entity10 to treat the tumors on her kidney , neck and chest - a number of which were visible to the naked eye			1
her parents initially said that she could be treated with the necessary chemotherapy and she underwent some rounds of the procedure but not enough to completely eradicate the cancer			1
but they soon changed their minds , saying that they want to use natural medicine like vitamins and herbs to solve the problem			0
@entity22 has already petitioned once to be granted guardianship of the girl but that initial request was rejected , and now they are re-applying to a different judge the @entity65 reported early in august that the hospital already applied to take over legal guardianship of @entity29 but were rejected by one @entity10 judge who has since retired			0
' the court can not deprive these parents of their right to make medical decisions for their daughter because there is not a scintilla of evidence showing the parents are unfit , ' judge @entity69 wrote in his decision before retiring earlier this month			2
he added that the girl 's parents were ' caring , attentive , protective and concerned '			0
it is unclear how long @entity29 underwent chemotherapy , but apparently long enough for the visible tumors on her neck and chest to disappear , as court records say that they went away but she did not go into remission			1
' @entity29 begged her parents to stop the treatments			0
@entity26 said she and @entity24 could not stand to watch what was happening to their daughter , ' judge @entity69 wrote			0
traditions : @entity7 ( who is not pictured ) and her family are @entity13 , and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn , some forms of modern medicine @entity29 apparently complained about feeling sick and she did n't want to become infertile			1
nausea , organ damage and infertility are all common side effects of chemotherapy , but in this case , doctors say that ' the question of @entity29 's treatment is life and death '			1
mrs @entity7 ' prayed for wisdom to discern @entity114 's plan for @entity29 ' and believed that the therapy was killing her			2
nurse and attorney @entity3 is appealing the decision and hopes to be granted limited guardianship so that she is in charge of making medical decisions for @entity29			0
' the plan presented by @entity29 ’s parents is almost certain to lead to @entity29 ’s death , ' she wrote in a letter to the court			0
' every day that goes by without treatment , @entity29 ’s chance of surviving her cancer is diminished			2
' with chemotherapy , her chances of survival increase to 85 per cent .			1

@entity7 , 10 , has leukemia and doctors say she will die unless she **receive*s* chemotherapy
her @entity13 parents initially allowed her to *receive* chemotherapy - and her visible tumors disappeared - but they stopped the treatment because she said she was in too much pain
if she has the procedure , her chance of survival is 85 *%* and if she does n't , doctors say she will die within one year
