a defiant dad - of - seven has responded to local officials who demanded he painted his house - by covering it in stars and stripes			2
@entity6 , 43 , was angry when a code enforcement officer visited his home in @entity9 , @entity10 after someone complained that he had left an old christmas tree on a balcony - and slapped him with even more complaints			1
among the gripes were missing window screens , peeling paint and the need for pressure washing , the @entity15 reported			1
but @entity6 , a married foster dad whose seven children are all adopted , said he has more things to worry about than minor alterations - especially because the house is safe for his large brood			1
the neighbors have supported the home 's new look - which @entity6 said is staying fight : @entity6 inherited the 100 - year - old home and said he should be able to do with it what he pleases so he decided to stand up for his family and together , they slathered the house in the most eye - catching way they could imagine - one that comes with a message			1
' i want to remind people this is @entity50 , ' he told @entity51			0
' this is the home of the free , and i 'm not changing because i have some zoning ordinance that does n’t like the way i express myself			2
' next they plan to put a @entity55 on the second floor and the @entity57 on the chimney			0
@entity6 , who grew up in the 100 - year - old home , said the trouble first began when code enforcement officers responded to an anonymous tip about the christmas tree a few months ago			1
in addition , some neighbors had complained about his ' tacky ' holiday decorations			2
' we got our oldest daughter when she was 10 , ' @entity6 told the @entity15			1
' she had been homeless all her life and never even knew what a christmas tree was			1
so yeah , i go all out with @entity73 trees and other decorations for that very reason			0
' support : mr @entity6 , who has adopted seven children with his wife , said they have more to worry about than cosmetic problems with their home			1
he said the house is a safe place for his children to live before : ahead of the paintwork , anonymous neighbors had complained that he still had a christmas tree up on a balcony , and city officials complained that the house needed aesthetic updates after : he said he has carried out most of the updates on his home but officials will check later this month @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 of @entity9 , said that his staff asked the family to remove the tree and they did			1
but then , the family were slapped with as many as nine other violations			2
homeowner @entity6 ' he sent out a list of all these things and i was like , " are you kidding me ? " ' @entity6 said , adding that he was most annoyed by a complaint that the paint on the outside of the house was not up to standard			1
' this is a house where a family lives and plays , ' he said			0
officials insisted that the issue was more than just cosmetic			0
' we had a safety concern about electrical , ' they told @entity118			0
' it seemed the wires were n't up to code			2
the balcony had rotten wood , some concerns , but the home is livable			0
' @entity6 was told if he fix his house in accordance to the standards , he would be fined $ 250 a day			2
inspiration ? @entity6 's wife previously shared an image of this house on @entity133 saying she loved that it reminded her that she was @entity50 he added that he has now complied with most of the complaints and will work on others - but the color of the house is staying			1
' i 'm not going to paint over it , ' he said			0
' neighbors agreed that they also liked it , as well as the family 's defiance			0
' i think it 's one of the best things in the neighborhood , ' @entity146 told @entity150 as he stopped to look			0
' my family and i are @entity152			0
we ’re not transplanted brits			0
we live the @entity50 life , and it 's people like this displaying their true patriotism that makes us proud to be here			0
' the city will inspect the home again on june 16 and if he has not met the standard , @entity6 will appear at a hearing the following day			1

code enforcement officers visited @entity6 's home earlier this year after someone complained he had an old christmas tree outside
@entity6 , who is dad to seven adopted children , was hit with a list of code violations , *including* missing window screens and peeling paint
so he decided to pick up the *paintbrush* and decorate the home with a flag
