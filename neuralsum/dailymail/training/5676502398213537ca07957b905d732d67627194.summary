entering the charts of @entity2 ’s most convincing wins in his @entity4 career , straight into the top three , goes @entity5			1
the defending champion was utterly ruthless in trouncing the 23 - year - old @entity7 in just 84 minutes to reach the third round and put himself on track , you would expect , for the second week			1
@entity2 ’s next opponent will be @entity14 ’s @entity13 , the world no 23 , and it is unlikely to be as straightforward as the exhibition put on for grateful @entity19 patrons in this unusual lunchtime spot			1
the world no 5 does not possess the threshing machine mentality of his two main rivals , which often sees them reach the latter part of tournaments with plenty in reserve			2
@entity2 is aware of that and set his mind to schooling the standout player from the highly competitive @entity54 college circuit of last year , who will play much better than this with a few more outings on grass			1
this was @entity2 ’s easiest victory at @entity23 , surpassing the first round of 2012 when he allowed @entity64 ’s @entity63 only six games			1
given that grass tends to offer more free points for the server than other surfaces , it is highly unusual that anyone is cleaned up as comprehensively as poor @entity30 was on wednesday			0
a lot of it was about energy conservation and making this obligatory visit to @entity19 — it is only right that no player gets a season ticket on @entity78 — impressively brief			1
@entity2 had a recent reminder of how important it is not to get bogged down in early rounds at the @entity83 where , slightly leg weary , he found himself on the wrong end of a severe tonking from @entity41 in the semi-finals			1
serving up a treat : @entity2 sends down a missile to his @entity7 opponent breezing through : @entity2 's girlfriend @entity90 arrives at @entity23 ( left ) and watches the match ( right ) good start : @entity2 's new coach @entity93 watches her charge in action on wednesday @entity2 's mother , @entity96 ( right ) , watches her son 's impressive performance from the stands hot dog : the @entity101 tries a trick shot in between his legs against @entity30 - and the line judge looks impressed royal approval : the @entity106 ( centre right ) smiles as she watches @entity2 in action 806 : combined rankings of @entity110 and @entity111			1
@entity64 is 566 due to injury lay - off 7 : @entity113 is the highest men 's seed to go out 83 : @entity13 , @entity2 ’s next opponent , had highest percentage of successful first serves 2 : number of @entity119 players that are left in singles action 7 : years since @entity122 played at @entity123			1
she made her return aged 33 in the doubles 46 : @entity127 and @entity128 hit the most winners 2 : twice in two days @entity130 has been knocked out : in singles and doubles			0
he says he ‘ hates ’ @entity123 42 : @entity134 @entity133 broke his own record for aces in a single match ‘ i ’m not saying i would have beaten @entity41 but it cost me there , playing lots of long matches , ’ he reflected			1
‘ against @entity143 ( in the third round ) i was up in every set and it eventually went to 12 - 10 in the fifth			2
so it ’s important to get through these matches as quickly as possible			0
’ a good barometer of how straightforward a @entity2 match has been at @entity23 is the type of questions he has to field afterwards : the more off - piste they are indicating just how comfortable a day it has been			1
and so he was asked if was he pleased the @entity106 had taken a diversion from the @entity156 to watch his match			0
what did he think of @entity159 biting @entity160 ? unnatural behaviour			0
pleased with @entity163 ’s appointment as @entity165 manager ? again , yes			0
is he concerned that @entity167 rejected a new contract with @entity169 ? it does not necessarily mean the team ’s marquee player will be leaving			0
then there was the retelling of how he rescued a large dog from traffic after it has strayed on to the road near his @entity180 home earlier in the week			0
more connected to tennis was his view about whether another @entity7 , @entity185 , should be allowed to switch nationalities and play in the @entity187 for @entity188			2
‘ i do n’t really mind , ’ he said			0
‘ if he becomes a @entity119 citizen and is able to play then i see no reason why he should n’t be able to do it			2
i do n’t make the rules			0
’ having to answer diverse enquiries is an encouraging symptom for @entity2 , who was also questioned about how it is going with @entity93			2
he reverted to his stock reply of ‘ so far , so good ’			0
brit of alright : fans packed out @entity203 ( or is it @entity203 ? ) to watch the defending champion on tv see you on friday : the defending champion salutes the crowd after his victory this certainly appears to be the case and if you talk to those within his camp they confirm that she has settled in very comfortably with the long - established group around him			1
there were also some encouraging clues in his match , even though @entity30 found his natural timing difficult to come by on the grass when being fed so many types of different spins and angles by a master of the surface			0
one good sign was that when the @entity7 created his three break points , one in each set , they were answered with strong first serves , two of them being aces			2
you still fear that less awed players will do some damage to @entity2 ’s second delivery but that was never really an issue in this match			2
the most animated the crowd got was when a ball fell out of the @entity101 ’s pocket in the second set , causing the rally to be replayed — it was that kind of afternoon .			0

@entity2 beat @entity5 in straight sets in @entity23 second round
@entity119 no 1 was never tested by @entity7 opponent on @entity19
defending champion at @entity123 won 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 0
