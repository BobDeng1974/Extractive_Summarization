the taxpayers ' bill for ferrying prisoners around in taxis leapt by almost 10 per cent last year , it emerged tonight			1
the @entity4 admitted that in 2013 - 14 it spent £ 3.4million on taxis for inmates , up from £ 3.1million a year earlier , but insisted it was an ' economical mode of transport '			1
the revelation is especially embarrassing after a treasury minister last year said the bill was a ' scandal '			2
the bill for taxis for prisoners last year hit £ 3.4million , the highest since the first year of the coalition ministers insisted using taxis was an ' economical ' way of transporting criminals , instead of buying dedicated prison vehicles			1
according to figures released in response to a parliamentary question , the bill for taxis for prisoners came to £ 3,417,595 , up from £ 3,133,614 last year			1
it is the highest the bill has been since the first year of the coalition			0
when last year 's sum was revealed , @entity32 mp @entity31 called it a ' scandal '			2
she is now a minister at the @entity35 , which has demanded a tighter grip on spending			2
the figure is for the cost of transporting prisoners for public sector prisons in @entity42 and @entity43			0
tonight @entity46 's shadow justice secretary @entity45 said : ' millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money is already paid to private companies to ferry around prisoners , and so the public will be confused why an additional £ 3million had to be shelled out last year for taxis for prisoners			1
' many people are struggling to pay their bills on a day to day basis , and taking a taxi for them is a rare luxury			2
' they will look at offenders being shuttled around in taxis and question what has gone wrong with the world			0
' we need competent ministers who know what they are doing rather than this shower			0
' this is yet more evidence of the shambles at the @entity4			0
@entity69 's government really do need to get a grip before any more of the hard pressed @entity73 public ’s money is wasted			0
' @entity46 's shadow justice secretary @entity45 said for most normal people a taxi is a ' luxury ' the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) is responsible for moving prisoners around the country , between prisons , police stations and courts and their care and security while in court custody			1
it runs contracts for secure escorts for all inmates , apart from @entity90 prisoners			0
but sometimes taxis are hired to drive them around instead of standard prison vans			2
prisons minister @entity94 said : ' there are occasions when the prison service may make use of taxis to provide prisons with a cost - effective , flexible way of fulfilling transport requirements for prisoners where there is a strong operational justification for doing so			1
' this is an economical mode of transport ( particularly in comparison with using cellular vehicles or purchasing cars )			1
it reduces potential overhead costs for prisons , such as maintenance and cleaning , which have an impact on staff time			0
' prisons are able to access this form of transport at short notice , in response to urgent requirements			0
