now @entity12 has become the latest royal to cause controversy with his choice of clothing after wearing a tie that ' symbolises the barbaric sport ' of bullfighting - according to animal rights campaigners			1
the @entity20 , which campaigns against violent sports such as bullfighting , shooting and fox hunting , said it was ' disappointed ' to see the @entity12 wearing the tie patterned with matadors when he opened @entity30 's new @entity29 earlier this year			1
faux pas : the matador tie worn by @entity12 has caused offence among animal rights campaigners attention was drawn away from the Â£ 55million library - which had just been through a three - year refurbishment - and to the item of clothing knotted about the neck of the eighth in line to the throne			1
the offending article was spotted by several people who turned up to see the event , several of whom were not impressed the @entity2 's choice of attire			2
one member of the public who was at the event said : ' it was very inappropriate for a member of the royal family to wear a tie like that			0
' i had to look closely , i could n't believe he was wearing a tie with bullfighters on it			0
' official blunder : the @entity12 wore the tie when he opened @entity29 bullfighting is a traditional blood sport in many countries , including @entity68 , @entity69 , the @entity70 , some @entity72 countries and the south of @entity74			1
animal cruelty campaigners object to the suffering and killing of the bulls for entertainment purposes			0
bullfighting has been banned in many places - most recently in @entity82 , where a bill forbidding the sport came into effect in 2012			0
but supporters of bullfights say it is a culturally important tradition , and movements to revoke the @entity91 ban often appear before the @entity68 congress			0
the @entity20 campaigns to stop bullfighting and all other cruel fiesta events involving animals			1
these include the @entity98 - when dozens of bulls are chased through the streets of the @entity68 city of @entity102 - and the @entity103 - a @entity68 custom involving setting a bull 's horns alight and allowing it to run through the streets			0
a spokesperson from @entity20 said : ' bullfighting is an incredibly cruel and outdated spectacle			1
' we are very disappointed to see such an influential public figure wearing an item of clothing that symbolises the barbaric bloodsport			0
