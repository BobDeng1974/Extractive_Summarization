@entity0 is embroiled in a row with a @entity3 professor - on the subject of gay sex with teenagers as the next chancellor of the @entity3 , @entity0 will be expected at all times to uphold the institution ’s good name			1
but , nearly six months before he takes up the post , he is already embroiled in a row with one of the university ’s academics – on the subject of gay sex with teenagers			1
the television gardener has attacked professor @entity17 , 46 , who boasted in a lecture that gay sex is best , that he targets 16 to 18 - year - olds , that he had already had sex with more than 1,000 teenagers and men , and that he planned to double the total even if he had to pay young prostitutes			1
mr @entity0 , 65 , says he is a committed @entity25 who deplores prof @entity17 ’s comments and is worried about the pressure ‘ impressionable ’ 16 - year - old boys face to have sex			1
he told the @entity30 : ‘ it ’s not that i ’m homophobic – i ’ve got some very good friends who are homosexuals			0
but i ’m talking about sex with young boys			0
there ’s a fine line between the age of consent and the other side of it			0
’ however two years ago the tv presenter chuckled when the professor – a guest on his afternoon chat show – declared : ‘ men just want sex with many people			1
’ prof @entity17 – said to be planning a complaint about the criticism from mr @entity0 – would only say : ‘ i have not met @entity0 since i was a guest on his show talking about the value of men cheating and of open sexual relationships			1
’ the @entity50 academic , who is married to a man , is @entity3 ’s professor of @entity52			2
he gave his lecture entitled ‘ why gay sex is best ’ to the @entity55 , and transgender society in 2011 , but it only recently came to light			2
as well as his boast of sex with ‘ easily over 1,000 people ’ , he is said to have added that he enjoyed voyages on cruise ships because ‘ it ’s like sex tourism ’			0
the professor , who is said to be considering complaining about mr @entity0 ( pictured ) , was a guest on his chatshow two years ago in response to criticism he later said ‘ sex should only occur between consenting adults ’			2
but a small pressure group calling itself because @entity71 began a campaign for prof @entity17 to be sacked			1
@entity3 said he had been reprimanded , but defended him as an ‘ internationally renowned gay scholar ’			2
professor @entity17 says he has slept with 1,000 men and boasted of having sex with 16 - year - olds when mr @entity0 was last month appointed the next chancellor , or ceremonial head , of the university , he was asked by @entity80 to refuse the post unless prof @entity17 was sacked			1
he replied that he was a committed @entity25 and deplored the professor ’s comments , but felt it was ‘ not justifiable ’ to sack someone ‘ because their sexual mores differ from one ’s own ’			0
however , he would have ‘ no hesitation in encouraging appropriate and justified action ’			0
mr @entity0 , a married grandfather , has now told the @entity30 : ‘ prof @entity17 was invited on to a stimulating , entertaining discussion on my show			1
two years on i encounter him again			0
i ’m now trying to step through this enormous can of worms without being bigoted			0
‘ he ’s talking about young boys who are impressionable			0
someone who is 16 is n’t magically prepared to resist pressure into sex			2
we have to be tolerant of everyone ’s way of life , but i find it worrying			0
’ he added : ‘ i ’d also worry about people having sex with 16 - year - old girls			1
