by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:54 pm on 5th february 2012 some politicians from @entity3 and @entity4 are using the @entity5 as an opportunity to make a point about their closest causes , or bond with their constituents			0
@entity3 congressman @entity11 is using it to make some serious cash			1
mr @entity11 has held pricey @entity5 parties in the past , and up until two weeks ago , his fundraising agency was still selling $ 5,000 tickets to his event this year			1
smiling for the @entity5 : @entity11 is thought to be hosting a $ 5,000 - per - ticket event during the game now , after the news of the event spread , the details of the party have become harder to come by			1
because the @entity25 allows elected officials to buy tickets to the big game at face value , mr @entity11 could easily purchase a number of tickets for a significantly cheaper rate than his constituents , and donors			1
while congressmen like mr @entity11 can buy tickets for $ 800 , $ 900 , or $ 1,200 , members of the public are spending up to $ 2,000 on tickets through websites like @entity39			2
when asked by the @entity40 , mr @entity11 would not say if his costly fundraising event was still being held , and would not even say if he was watching the game in @entity3 or at the stadium in @entity44			1
in 2010 , when no @entity3 team was even playing in the @entity5 , mr @entity11 held a similar $ 5,000 - per - ticket party in @entity48 for the game			1
the seven - term congressman , who represents a relatively small area in the @entity3 borough of @entity53 , has already raised $ 369,118 during this election cycle			2
that total ranks him number 404 of the 539 members of congress in terms of how much money they have raised since 2011			0
mr @entity11 ( right ) , seen here with president @entity61 and first lady @entity62 , is a seven term congressman representing a portion of @entity53 this is not the first time that mr @entity11 ' financial dealings have caused some questions : he was investigated by the @entity68 in 2010 because of a questionable loan that a donor gave him			2
he is also thought to have received a number of financial benefits because of his congressional status , including a cut - rate cost on his home and numerous luxury vacations for him and his wife that were paid for by donors			0
mr @entity11 also had a long - standing business relationship with @entity80 , the ponzi - schemer whose trial is currently underway			0
making good use of the game : @entity85 mayor @entity84 and @entity3 mayor @entity86 filmed an ad together advocating gun control unlike mr @entity11 , most @entity3 politicians have been very forthcoming about their @entity5 plans			0
governor @entity91 will be watching the game in @entity3 , and mayor @entity86 will cheering for the @entity94 from inside the @entity44 stadium			0
mr @entity86 also filmed a commercial with @entity85 mayor @entity84 , which will air regionally during the game , to bring attention to their fight against the illegal sale of guns .			0
