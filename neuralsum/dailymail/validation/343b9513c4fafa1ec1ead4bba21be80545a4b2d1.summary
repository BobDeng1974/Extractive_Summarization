@entity8 , 20 , has suffered from a heart defect from birth and was hoping to enter the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , where he has an appointment in 10 days			1
' my world has fallen down , ' @entity15 said			2
' this needs to be fixed quickly			0
' @entity19 has fallen : @entity8 , 20 , and his mother , @entity20 , said he had been denied a visa for the second time that would have allowed him to seek treatment for heart and liver conditions his mother , @entity20 , said her son could die if he can not receive the transplants			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity30 , @entity31 , said people at the department are looking into the case , though the department did not have a comment on @entity15 's case			1
@entity38 , which is based in the @entity3 where it helps uninsured people secure medical care , stepped in to try to get @entity15 to the @entity11			1
the organization 's director , @entity41 , said the case was mishandled at the @entity3 @entity43 in the northern city of @entity45 , where @entity15 lives			2
he said that consulate officials processed an application for a tourist visa when they should have told @entity15 to apply for a humanitarian visa and that they then failed for weeks to respond to queries about his status			1
' we have dealt with around two dozen similar international cases , ' @entity41 said			0
' they have never denied us a visa			2
it 's the first time this has happened			0
' struggle : @entity15 's friends and family raised $ 15,000 to pay for an evaluation leading up to the treatment , and though the operation could millions more , @entity15 's mother says they will try weakened : @entity15 's heart has only one ventricle , which causes circulation problems , and at this point , in spite of several heart surgeries , his liver has also been damaged come together : @entity15 and his family have held fundraisers , such as @entity74 , where several musical acts played to raise money for the treatments @entity78 hopes : @entity15 wants to overcome his health problems and hopes to become a doctor long road ahead : @entity15 's family says the transplant will cost much more , and even as they are looking for help to fund it , they are unsure about how to pay the high cost @entity41 said the family would file a visa application on humanitarian grounds shortly and he hopes the problem will be resolved in two or three days			1
he called the situation an ' absolute abomination			0
' @entity15 's heart has only one ventricle , causing circulation problems that mean blood reaches only one of the four chambers , said dr @entity100 , who treats him			1
@entity15 underwent three open - heart surgeries between the ages of 5 months and 12 years , including a cardiac implant that stopped working properly in 2013			1
at this point @entity15 's liver has also been damaged , so he needs a double - organ transplant , a procedure that is not performed in his home country			1
' the experience in @entity2 for a transplant of that complexity is nil , ' @entity100 said , adding that ' nobody can be sure that he wo n't deteriorate at any moment			0
' the doctor added that in severe cases , not performing the surgery in time can make a transplant impossible later			0
@entity15 , whose father is an @entity120 resident , had a @entity3 visa until he was 15			1
but when it expired , his family did n't renew it because they did n't have money to pay for more trips			0
the family currently lives in a modest , one - story home in a potholed suburb of @entity45 , capital of @entity132 state			0
he shares a room with his brother			0
thin and pale with his body swollen from his condition and marked by scars from his operations , @entity15 is nevertheless active and optimistic about the future			2
he dreams of becoming a doctor , even though his health problems have so far made it impossible to attend college , work or stand up for long periods			0
family and friends in @entity45 organized fundraisers , sold tamales , hamburgers and seafood and held raffles to defray the initial cost of his potential treatment at the @entity11			2
' we needed $ 15,000 and we put together a little bit more , just for the evaluation ' said @entity8			0
' afterward , the double transplant would cost around $ 2 million ... for now , i do n't want to think about that			0
