by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:37 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 20 february 2013 the @entity2 has been accused of wasting £ 13,500 of taxpayers ' cash and donations after it pursued a family through the courts only for a hunt case to collapse straight away			1
farmer @entity10 used a terrier to legally flush out a fox last year , before he and his family were then accused of disturbing a badger sett by the charity			1
a police raid on their farm followed , with equipment seized , while mr @entity10 , his partner @entity20 , and his teenage daughter @entity21 were separated and taken for hour - long interviews at a local police station			0
victory : @entity10 , his daughter @entity27 , and partner @entity28 at their farm on the day the @entity2 case against them was thrown out for a year the family has lived under ' extreme stress ' and @entity27 now 19 , was left ' unable to sleep ' or study for her a-levels			1
' i just gave up			0
it was too stressful , ' she said			0
but yesterday the case against them collapsed on the first morning at @entity39 after the @entity2 admitted they did not have enough evidence against them to continue			1
it is estimated the charity spent £ 3,500 of donations funding the botched case and the taxpayer will have to pick up the estimated legal bill of £ 10,000 for the family 's defence lawyers			1
upset : the family were split up and interviewed by police after a fox was legally flushed out on the farm , which led to the @entity2 claiming they disturbed a badger sett mr @entity10 claims animal activists had ' hidden behind bushes ' to secretly film the activity at a fox 's earth - the evidence the later used to try and prosecute him			1
he maintains the area was not being used by badgers and that his family was targeted for doing nothing wrong in an effort to stop the hunt			0
' it is a nightmare when you know you are not guilty and you have done nothing wrong but you are being picked on to make an example of , ' he said			0
' the @entity2 are not interested in animal welfare , they are just going after the hunting community			2
they do not have to pay the bills , it is the taxpayer			0
' case : the hearing at @entity79 yesterday collapsed when the @entity2 admitted they did not have enough evidence @entity27 , who was eighteen at the time of the raid on her family 's @entity79 farm in march last year called the behaviour ' intimidating			1
' she said : ' i feel my family was targeted			0
it was intimidating and very scary			0
' their solicitor @entity89 called the move to prosecute the family , who regularly help with the @entity93 to hunt legally with dogs , ' an ill - informed decision			0
' @entity96 , director of campaigns at the @entity97 , accused the animal charity of pursuing a ' vindictive campaign ' against legal hunts based on ' weak and flawed ' evidence			1
' it is simply disgraceful that the @entity2 is using the criminal justice system to pursue a vindictive campaign against the hunting community , ' he said			2
' there is no way on earth that the police and @entity110 would have prosecuted on such flawed and weak evidence , but the @entity2 pursued mr @entity10 and his family simply because they were part of the @entity93			1
' view : the family 's solicitor said they were only targeted because they were part of the famous @entity93 ( pictured ) he added the @entity2 also have two other ongoing cases connected to hunts in the @entity120 and @entity121 , one of which also involves interfering with a badger sett			1
the news comes as the @entity126 questioned the @entity2 's use of its own funds to bring prosecutions after a judge criticised the charity for spending £ 326,000 prosecuting @entity133 's local hunt the @entity134			2
the charity pointed out that the case against mr @entity10 was reviewed against the @entity137 and at all stages leading up to the trial , it had been considered appropriate to prosecute			2
' the @entity2 believes that if it is presented with evidence of alleged offences concerning animal cruelty they should be properly investigated and prosecuted where appropriate , ' a spokesman said			2
' it is extremely rare that @entity2 cases conclude like this			0
we prosecute roughly 1 per cent of the incidents we are asked to investigate and have a success rate of around 98 per cent			0

charity took family to court after they helped flush out a fox from their farm
@entity2 accused them of disturbing a badger sett and *launched* proceedings
case collapsed on first day of trial because of lack of evidence
