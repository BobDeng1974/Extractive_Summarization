the veil of friendship has been wrenched from the @entity2			2
it happened here in sunlit @entity5 , when @entity6 appeared to threaten to drive his @entity8 team - mate @entity7 off the track as revenge for the controversial manner in which the @entity12 took pole position			1
the drama started as @entity7 , who already held the fastest time , pushed hard in his final qualifying lap. braking from 160mph into the right - hander @entity16 , he lost control			1
rather than taking the corner , he steered his car unscathed into a small run - off area on the left			2
behind him , @entity6 was eating up the tarmac			1
he was on target to snatch pole position from @entity7			1
but as he arrived at @entity27 , @entity7 was reversing on to the track			1
yellow caution flags were waved and @entity6 had to abort his attempt			1
had he done what @entity42 did at the @entity45 corner in 2006 , when he blocked @entity47 ’s last lap. for that act of cheating , @entity42 was sent to the back of the grid , his reputation tarnished			2
@entity6 ’s body language suggested he thought his team - mate had erred , even though the stewards ultimately ruled that he had not			1
his face told of sullen indignation as he posed unwillingly for the post-qualifying pictures of the top three			2
for the record , @entity59 was third			0
potentially the most incendiary comment @entity6 made was when asked if he would discuss the matter with @entity7			1
he said , cryptically : ‘ i do n’t know if ( @entity64 ) @entity63 and ( @entity66 ) @entity65 talked about it , but i quite liked the way @entity63 dealt with that , so i ’ll take a page out of his book			0
’ he could have been referring to several incidents , or the whole poisonous atmosphere among the two great rivals of the 1980s and 1990s , but most observers thought he was referring to @entity63 turning his car into @entity65 at the start of the @entity78			0
a night ’s sleep will probably have encouraged him to abandon such notions before he lines up on the grid			0
@entity8 ’s pr functionaries will probably brief that he did not mean any harm to @entity7 at all			1
whatever they say , the dynamics of this title fight have changed irrevocably			0
the matiness has not lasted to the start of the sixth race of the 19 - round season , and we observers can say hurrah for that			0
the disintegration began in earnest earlier this week when @entity6 claimed he was hungrier than @entity7 because his childhood was poor rather than gilded like his @entity5 - based team - mate			1
body language : @entity6 did n't hide his anger with his team - mate very well controversial : @entity7 was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in saturday 's qualifying session @entity6 was almost monosyllabic in the immediate aftermath of the controversy			1
asked what he thought about hearing over the radio that the yellow flags had been waved , he said : ‘ not much really			0
’ asked to elaborate , he replied : ‘ not really much			0
i did n’t really think of anything			0
the lap was done and that was that			2
’ asked if he thought @entity7 had stopped on purpose , he said : ‘ potentially			1
’ at this point , the paddock returned a split verdict			0
@entity115 , the 1996 world champion , exonerated @entity7			1
@entity116 , a former team - mate of @entity42 , raised a few doubts			0
sir @entity118 , the triple world champion , said he hoped @entity7 had not strayed from sportsmanship			1
disappointing : @entity6 could only manage second place , and was denied his fifth consecutive pole emotional : @entity7 celebrates after grabbing pole at the @entity5 as everyone chipped in his thoughts , @entity7 ’s father @entity124 , world champion in 1982 , stood outside the @entity8 motorhome			1
he , we recall , had criticised @entity42 as ‘ a cheap cheat ’ for the @entity131 disgrace			0
three - and - a - quarter hours after qualifying ended , the stewards cleared ‘ the driver of car six ’ after ‘ examining video and telemetry data from the team and @entity138 ’			2
what next ? @entity65 , who could be described as an expert witness on this subject , said only a few days ago : ‘ one little problem inside the team , or a little bit outside , and then the feuding could start really very quickly			0
’ the best hope of @entity6 passing @entity7 is presented at the first corner – if he resists any urge to drive him off			1
otherwise , the restrictively thin track will work in @entity7 ’s advantage			2
the scene is set : the sun shines over the race circuit in @entity5 that is but one reason why yesterday was balm to the @entity12			1
he had been outperformed in most critical moments of the opening races of the season and desperately needed to arrest the slump			0
in doing so , in these dramatic circumstances , he has also possibly damaged @entity6 ’s sometimes brittle psyche			1
how he will recover today will be intriguing and instructive			0
@entity118 said : ‘ i spent my whole life as a professional racing driver trying to take emotion out of it			0
you can not afford to be happy or angry			0
the moment you do , you lose control			0
you have to be clear headed , cold and focused			0
i am surprised @entity6 reacted the way he did			2
’ but how will @entity6 react at the first corner today ? eyes on every yacht will be watching .			2

@entity6 was seething after qualifying following the dramatic late drama
@entity7 's off at @entity27 meant @entity6 could n't complete his final lap
@entity6 appeared to threaten the @entity12 after the controversy in @entity5
@entity7 escaped further action after he was *investigated* by the stewards
