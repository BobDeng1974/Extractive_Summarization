protesters spent a third day camped out in @entity3 @entity2 building as they readied themselves to hear governor @entity5 's full budget proposal later today			1
@entity3 gov. @entity5 , quickly becoming a darling of @entity7 across the country for his plan to take away most collective bargaining rights from public workers , will get another chance to bolster his national conservative credentials when he unveils the rest of his plan for dealing with the state 's budget woes			1
@entity5 's plan - set to be released tuesday - will include deep cuts for schools and local governments to help close a projected $ 3.6 billion shortfall in the two - year budget			1
police have refused to unlock the entrances today because they are trying to prevent protesters from sleeping overnight in the building			2
protests in the @entity2 building began on february 15 , and by sunday police had threatened to begin removing people after 4pm			1
but with so many demonstrators ignoring the deadline to leave , they had no choice but to give in to the demands to stay			0
after two weeks of massive protests , officials say there will be only limited access to the @entity2 for @entity5 's budget address			1
on monday , police would not allow people to enter the building unless they were attending a public hearing or being escorted by lawmakers or their staff			0
police said they were trying to resolve conflicts with a handful of protesters who had refused to move to the ground floor of the building where demonstrators were being told to stay			2
hundreds marched outside the @entity2			1
president @entity66 told @entity68 state governors yesterday that everyone should be ready to sacrifice to help tackle the deficit			2
but in a nod to the conflict between public sector unions and the governor in @entity3 , @entity66 said it did not do anyone any good to ' denigrate ' public employees			1
steadfast : demonstrators have occupied building with a round - the - clock protest for the past 14 days protesting governor @entity5 's attempt to push through a bill that would restrict collective bargaining rights @entity5 already has taken on president @entity66 and @entity3 's unions , a traditional @entity87 stalwart			1
before he even took office , @entity5 's opposition to high - speed rail resulted in the @entity66 administration taking back more than $ 800 million that had been awarded to the state			1
@entity5 's plan also calls on state workers to contribute 5.8 percent of their salaries toward pensions and double their health insurance contribution beginning april 1			1
those changes would be expanded to nearly all other public workers , except those operating under existing union contracts , beginning july 1			0
the higher benefit contribution would equate to an 8 percent pay decrease for the average worker			0
the state would save $ 30 million this fiscal year and $ 300 million over the next two years			0
@entity5 said without those savings , 1,500 workers would have to be laid off between now and july and 12,000 state and local employees over the next two years			1
unions for teachers and state workers have said they would agree to the benefit concessions as long as they retain collective bargaining rights			0
staying put : around 200 demonstrators , left , chant ' peaceful protest ' and ' whose house is this ? our house '			0
while , right , others left peacefully after 14 days occupying the state @entity2 in @entity123 , @entity3 labor leaders and @entity87 lawmakers say @entity5 's proposal is intended to undermine unions and weaken a key @entity87 voter base			1
' he 's not even conceding the fact that they 've given them the money , ' @entity87 senator @entity129 said in an interview in @entity135			0
' he 's threatening their livelihoods			0
he 's treating them like poker chips			0
' @entity5 has threatened that if the state does n't pass his proposal by tuesday , deeper cuts and layoffs would be required			1
missing that deadline means the state wo n't be able to save $ 165 million through debt refinancing , @entity5 says			1
backing : the ' police officer ' with what appears to be a @entity123 police badge on his breast and the words cops for @entity151 ' printed on the back of his sweat shirt , below , addresses the crowd at the @entity3 @entity2 state building in @entity123 puppet protest : two demonstrators in masks demonstrate outside @entity3 governor @entity5 's office at the state capitol building on friday , @entity3 's state assembly approved @entity5 's proposal to strip public sector unions of most collective bargaining rights			1
the plan now needs state @entity168 approval , but @entity168 @entity87 have fled @entity3 to prevent a vote			1
over the weekend , there were solidarity rallies around the country with several thousand protesters gathering in @entity175 and @entity176			0
about 1,000 people turned out in @entity135 , @entity178 and @entity179 , @entity180			0
several hundred rallied in @entity182 , @entity183 , and about 100 people joined a demo in @entity186			0
other states considering similar proposals to @entity3 include @entity180 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			2
the stakes are high for labour groups because more than a third of @entity68 public employees , including teachers , police and civil service workers , belong to unions			0
police officers must plan what to do with the hundreds of protesters who were allowed an extra night in the building sleeping : the weary protesters will spend one more night in the state building teacher @entity210 at the @entity135 protest said : ' we bailed out @entity213 , we bailed out @entity214 , we bailed out @entity215 , but the hell with our teachers , our fire fighters , our nurses , our city workers , our state workers ! ' i 'm here because that 's unjust , unfair , ' @entity224 , 51 , drove over three hours from his home in @entity226 to attend the protest in @entity182			2
he said : ' what they 're trying to do ( in @entity3 ) is very heavy - handed ; it 's un-american			2
' in @entity175 , people waved signs reading ' cut bonuses , not teachers , ' ' unions make us strong , ' and ' @entity214 is destroying @entity68 , ' and wore stickers that read ' we are all @entity3			2
' meanwhile , mr @entity5 has vowed he will not climb down over his bill which would also require them to contribute more to health insurance and pensions			2
he has warned that 10,000 state workers could lose their jobs if the bill is not passed			0
on @entity247 's @entity246 today , he said stripping the workers of collective bargaining rights was necessary to give the state the flexibility to get its finances in order			0
he believed that some of the @entity256 senators will return soon .			0
