an @entity1 woman has miraculously given birth to conjoined twins with one body and two heads despite doctors initially telling them to terminate the pregnancy			1
@entity8 and her partner @entity9 , of @entity10 in @entity12 's west , welcomed their daughters on thursday six weeks before they were due			1
the couple , who found out via an ultrasound that the twins they were expecting was in fact one child with two symmetrical faces and two brains connected by the one brain stem , said doctors were shocked by the girls ' exceptional progress			1
ms @entity8 gave birth to the girls , named @entity30 and @entity28 , via an emergency caesarean at @entity47 last thursday			1
the girls were born with a rare condition called diprosopus , which means they share the same body and vital organs but have their own faces and brains which are connected by only one brain stem			1
' even though there is only one body , we call them our twins			0
to us , they are our girls and we love them , ' mr @entity9 said			0
they were transferred to the @entity60 at @entity61 shortly after they were born			0
' we have no idea how long they will be in hospital			0
we just want to bring them home , happy and healthy to make our family a little bit bigger and a bit more chaotic , ' mr @entity9 said			0
@entity28 and @entity30 's have their own brains which are connected by only one brain stem ' i think they 're beautiful and @entity9 thinks they 're beautiful so really that 's all that matters , ' their mother said			1
as the parents of seven other children , @entity80 and her husband @entity9 never considered terminating while the girls grew healthy the condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived			1
due to the incredibly complex nature of their condition , doctors are so unsure about what to expect from the twin ’s condition that they are being forced to make their prognoses day by day			2
mr @entity9 confirmed that specialists are being called in to decipher a range of problems and assess the twins in great depth , from the functioning of their lungs and blood vessels to decisions about how best to proceed with feeding			0
but despite all the forewarned medial problems likely to come their way , ms @entity8 and mr @entity9 are just happy their girls are alive and well			1
' i think they 're beautiful and @entity9 thinks they 're beautiful so really that 's all that matters , ' ms @entity8 told @entity112			2
mr @entity9 said : ' i sort of do n't believe in terminating the baby if it 's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan ' their mother @entity80 gave birth to the girls via an emergency caesarean their condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived from as early as 28 weeks into ms @entity8 ’s pregnancy , specialists were concerned about grave developmental issues			1
one of the biggest predicted survival risks from their doctor @entity126 , was that the babies would be unable to breathe on their own			0
the couple , who are parents to seven other children , were also told early on in the pregnancy not to keep the child ‘ because it would be looked upon by the public as a freak ’			0
they defied the doctors because ms @entity8 had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family ' that gives us a lot of support '			2
at first , things certainly looked to be taking a turn for the worst as ms @entity8 unexpectedly went into labour at only 32 weeks last thursday , and was forced to have an emergency caesarean			2
the couple refused to terminate their unborn twins despite being warned by doctors of the medical and social problems the girls were likely to suffer channel 9 were given the honour of choosing the middle names of the newborns , picking @entity159 and @entity160 the twin girls were not breathing in the first few moments after their birth , leaving their parents in a state of great anxiety but despite problems from the first moments of their birth , in which @entity30 and @entity28 were not heard to be breathing despite having a clear singular heartbeat , the girls have now defied all odds and are currently in a stable state and breathing without any assistance			1
although the couple were aware from the early stages of pregnancy that their children would have great developmental problems , they explained that while the girls continued to grow healthily , they could n’t come to terms with letting their unborn twins go			0
' we sort of looked at it as ; it 'd be the same as being a child with autism or @entity187			0
i sort of do n't believe in terminating the baby if it 's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan , ' mr @entity9 said			0
the proud parents of the small survivors have braced themselves for a difficult path ahead and refuse to say goodbye prematurely			0
' i would say , if i only get two days with the baby , i only get two days with the baby - at least i have some time with it , ' ms @entity8 said			2
the conjoined twins share all their major organs apart from their brains it was at 19 weeks into her pregnancy that ms @entity8 became aware that her unborn babies were conjoined source : the @entity206			1
