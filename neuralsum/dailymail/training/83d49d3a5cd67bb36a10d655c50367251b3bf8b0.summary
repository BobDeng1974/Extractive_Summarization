the innovation could provide the vital early warning of sepsis , which is responsible for almost 40,000 hospital deaths each year thousands of lives could be saved by a simple test to detect potentially - fatal blood poisoning within a matter of hours			1
a blood test could provide the vital early warning of sepsis , which is responsible for almost 40,000 hospital deaths each year – more than breast and bowel cancer combined			1
when combined with antibiotic drugs , the measure could improve a patient ’s chances and save up to 15,000 lives a year			1
conventional blood tests currently take up to 48 hours to confirm the illness , which has a mortality rate in excess of 40 per cent			1
but scientists at @entity22 have identified a molecule in the blood which is raised in those with sepsis , also known as septicaemia			1
they have now developed a blood test that , in tests , diagnosed the condition within two hours with 86 per cent accuracy			1
large scale trials of the test are now being planned , and it is hoped to make it available on the @entity36 in as little as a year			1
lead researcher professor @entity38 said : ‘ sepsis is a hidden killer , causing nearly a third of all hospital deaths			1
rapid antibiotic treatment for the condition is vital - every minute counts , ’ he said			0
‘ yet current diagnostic methods can take up to two days , so an accurate diagnostic test that can be carried out at the patient ’s bedside is urgently needed			0
we have for the first time identified a group of biomarkers [ molecules ] in the blood that are good indicators of sepsis			2
‘ we have shown that it is possible to detect these markers by screening a patient ’s blood in the ward , a process which can deliver results within two hours			2
this is an extremely exciting development , and hopefully we can improve recovery rates , but this has the potential to save thousands of lives every year			2
’ sepsis costs the @entity36 more than £ 2billion a year and occurs when the immune system has a severe overreaction to an infection , attacking organs such as the heart and liver			1
sepsis causes fever , inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure and death it causes fever , inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure and death			2
on its website , the @entity90 says healthcare workers have just six hours to deliver a set of interventions like antibiotics and intravenous fluids once the illness strikes			0
but fewer than one fifth of patients receive this standard of care due to its complexity			0
the research , published in the journal @entity106 , took blood from individuals with sepsis , those with systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( @entity112 ) – a similar condition that does not respond to antibiotics – and healthy patients			0
after comparing the samples , they isolated a molecule that was more active in sepsis patients than in the other groups			0
medical microbiologist @entity121 , of @entity122 , said : ‘ an early intervention in these cases can often result in a much improved result for the patient			0
‘ with this in mind , any improvements or aids to the diagnosis of such diseases are to be welcomed , especially when the tests are rapid and potentially able to be of use at the point of care			0
’ professor @entity137 , professor of microbial pathogenesis at @entity139 , said : ‘ the accurate and rapid diagnosis of sepsis is vitally important and necessary to ensure some of our sickest patients receive the most effective method of treatment			0
current methods are not accurate or rapid enough			0

@entity148 can detect sepsis much earlier than conventional *techniques*
sepsis currently has a 40 per cent mortality rate
it could be used by @entity36 in just a year
