by @entity0 while shooting their television programme on location , an @entity2 film crew managed to record more than they initially expected on @entity8 ’s @entity7			1
on april 3 , an @entity2 - produced art show were filming their opening sequence in @entity12 , completely unaware of what was happening in the background			1
but while editing the episode over the past week , @entity17 presenter @entity16 noticed something paranormally strange – what he believes to be two ufos			1
