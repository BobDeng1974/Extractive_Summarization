@entity0 is rushing vital technical equipment to @entity2 after a major breakdown in the specialised vessels being used to search for the missing flight mh370			1
the under - sea search vehicle known as @entity7 - 21 and the high - tech ship @entity8 have suffered the same fate as the missing @entity11 jet - a failure by their transponders to communicate with one another			1
the transponders on the @entity7 and the @entity8 have to be able to communicate as they respectively search the bed of the @entity19 and the surface			1
it came as @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity2 all agreed to re-examine all data related to missing @entity26 to better pinpoint the search area			1
minister @entity44 told reporters in @entity46 : ' i have briefed the @entity22 cabinet yesterday on the outcome of the meeting and it has been deliberated			2
' i now have the mandate to announce that the details of the transition phase have been approved by the @entity22 government , ' he said			2
the @entity55 government has already been forced into an embarrassing admission that equipment used in the mammoth hunt for the wreckage of flight mh370 has been plagued by technical defects			1
the @entity62 disappeared from tracking systems 68 days ago , costing authorities around the world hundreds of millions of dollars			0
in a statement released on thursday by the @entity68 , a federal government initiative set up specifically for the @entity26 search , it was announced that some of the tracking gear on defence ship @entity73 was flawed			1
frustrating delay : @entity73 ca n't redeploy its submersible until spare parts arrive from the @entity0 location : the @entity79 had been scrutinising photos of the object , which washed ashore six miles east of @entity82 in @entity2 state it comes as the @entity55 government dedicated $ 89.9 million in the 2014 budget to continue the search for @entity26 in the southern @entity19			1
the government estimates that it will have spent $ 10million already by june 30 this year , according to @entity88			0
' examination of the communications problem has established that a hardware defect exists in the transponder mounted on the @entity8 and that a defect may also exist in the transponder mounted on the @entity31			0
this inhibits the ability of the two devices to communicate with each other , ' the statement read			0
@entity7 - 21 is a submersible vessel scouring the seabed off @entity2 for any sign of the aircraft at the centre of one of aviation 's most perplexing mysteries			1
faulty : the @entity31 was damaged after colliding with a transponder on its mother ship the realisation at this point in the search process will add further frustration and delay to the plights of the familes of 239 people on board the flight who remain totally unaccounted for			2
' spare parts for both defects will be dispatched from the @entity0			1
the parts are expected to arrive in @entity2 on sunday			1
' @entity8 is currently en route to @entity124 , @entity2 , to receive the transponder parts			2
the journey is anticipated to take a number of days			0
at this stage , @entity8 is expected go alongside so engineers can make a full assessment of the transponder repairs , ' the statement read			0
@entity31 was recently damaged while being hoisted back aboard the @entity73			2
it is believed 20 - knot winds caused the equipment to crash into the side of the ship and collide with the transponder			2
as a result the acoustic communication links between the two pieces of hardware malfunctioned			2
the seemingly cursed search for @entity26 now includes personnel from @entity2 , the @entity23 , @entity22 and the @entity33			1
operation headquarters recently relocated from @entity146 to @entity38			0
a sample image of how @entity7 - 21 ' sees ' when it is deployed			1
this example shows what the site of two wrecked ships looks like the 21 - foot - long autonomous underwater vehicle is designed for deep - sea surveying and is capable of staying submerged for 25 hours at a time without refueling , scanning regions at a speed of two to three knots			0
shaped like a torpedo , it can operate almost up to three miles underneath the waves and is equipped with a variety of sonar and cameras that can search and map 40 square miles of sea floor per day			0
it has only being deployed because it can not be used until a search area is narrowed down			0
@entity7 21 has a depth rating of 4,500m , meaning it will be at its limit in the @entity19 search zone			1
searchers usually programme the propeller - driven vehicle with the coordinates for a back - and - forth search that has been compared to mowing a lawn			0
first , the vehicle will survey the area with side - scan sonar			0
the sonar readings are stored in the robot 's removable memory , and retrieved once the sub comes back up to the surface			0
if the sonar scan turns up objects of interest , the @entity7 21 would be refitted with high - resolution cameras for a visual survey			1
the robot would have to dive closer to the seafloor for a concentrated survey of the target area			0
when the imagery is brought back up , it would be analysed to see if there is any sign of the blackbox			0
one of the @entity7 21 's most recent claims to fame was its role in the search for wreckage from @entity205 's airplane , which disappeared in the @entity206 in 1937			1
@entity207 says its @entity208 can also be used for archaeology , oceanography , mine countermeasures , and unexploded ordinance .			0

@entity0 is rushing vital technical equipment to @entity2 for the search
it follows major breakdown in the specialised vessels being used
investigators had found technical defects in two pieces of equipment
@entity22 , @entity23 and @entity2 have all agreed to re-examine all data
hardware on @entity73 and @entity7 - 21 both *compromised*
*revelations* will delay search until sunday while spare parts are flown in
budget papers estimate search will end up costing @entity2 $ *90million*
