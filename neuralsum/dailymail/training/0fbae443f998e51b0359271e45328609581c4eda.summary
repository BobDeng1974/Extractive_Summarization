by @entity0 it ’s regarded as one of most promising places for alien life in the solar system			1
but missions to @entity7 have been few and far between , with many questions about this frozen moon still left unanswered			1
now in an effort to carry out some key research on @entity15 's moon , @entity11 is finally looking at proposals – but they ’re sticking to a tight budget			1
@entity11 is now accepting mission proposals to explore @entity15 's @entity19			1
in this image , taken by @entity20 as it flew by on 9 july 1979 , can be seen chaos terrain , faults and ridges that are almost certaintly the result of a vast , ice - capped global ocean underground @entity11 issued the @entity26 ( @entity27 ) to science and engineering communities for ideas for a mission to @entity7 to be submitted by 30 may			1
the @entity27 's focus is for concepts for a mission to @entity7 that costs less than $ 1 billion ( £ 590 million ) , excluding the rocket that would take them into space			1
each mission proposal must aim to meet as many of the science priorities as possible recommended by the @entity41 's 2011 @entity40 for the study of @entity7			2
‘ this is an opportunity to hear from those creative teams that have ideas on how we can achieve the most science at minimum cost , ’ said @entity43 , associate administrator for the @entity44 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity47			0
‘ @entity7 is one of the most interesting sites in our solar system in the search for life beyond @entity59			0
‘ the drive to explore @entity7 has stimulated not only scientific interest but also the ingenuity of engineers and scientists with innovative concepts			0
’ @entity11 has studied a variety of mission designs and concepts in previous years and currently is funding the development of technologies that will be needed for the science instruments for a @entity7 mission			1
the @entity73 is a review of astronomy and astrophysics literature produced every 10 years			0
it recommends research priorities for the coming decade based on the review			0
the 2011 @entity40 deemed a mission to @entity81 as among the highest priority scientific pursuits for @entity11			0
it lists five key science objectives in priority order that are necessary to improve our understanding of this potentially habitable moon			0
the mission will need to : characterise the extent of the ocean and its relation to the deeper interior			0
characterise the ice shell and any subsurface water , and see how they interact			0
determine global surface compositions and chemistry , especially with regards to habitability			0
understand the formation of surface features , including sites of recent or current activity , and identify and characterise candidate sites for future detailed exploration			0
understand @entity7 's space environment and interaction with @entity15 's magnetosphere			1
there have been various proposals to explore @entity7 over the years , such as the @entity111 ( pictured ) which would be taken underground by a larger drill before it was then released into the ocean , searching for signs of past or present alien life @entity116 appropriated $ 80 million ( £ 47 million ) for this work in the @entity11 ’s last budget , while the most recent budget proposal requests an additional $ 15 million ( £ 9 million )			1
previous scientific findings point to the existence of a liquid water ocean located under the moon 's icy crust			2
this ocean covers @entity7 entirely and contains more liquid water than all of @entity59 's oceans combined			2
although @entity7 and @entity15 's other moons have been visited by other spacecraft , they were each limited to a single distant flyby of these satellites			1
@entity11 ’s @entity135 spacecraft , launched in 1989 by the space shuttle , was the only mission to make repeated visits to @entity7 , passing close by the moon fewer than a dozen times			1
in december 2013 , @entity11 ’s @entity141 observed water vapour above the moon 's frigid south polar region			0
this provided the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon 's surface , and a spacecraft could even be designed to fly through the plumes to make measurements of the composition of the underground ocean			1
any mission to @entity7 must take into account the harsh radiation environment that would require unique protection of the spacecraft and instruments			2
in addition , spacecraft must meet planetary protection requirements intended to protect @entity7 's potentially habitable ocean			2
these requirements are very strict and involve ensuring that a viable @entity59 organism is not introduced into the @entity7 ocean			0
water plumes seen spouting from the surface provide evidence for the existence of a vast ocean beneath @entity7			2
it is thought the moon holds more water than all the oceans and sea on @entity59 combined , making it one of the most attractive science destinations in the solar system the last spacecraft to visit @entity7 was @entity182 ( artist 's illustration shown ) , which flew past the icy moon in 2007			1
the @entity11 vehicle is now on its way to @entity188 , which it will arrive at in july 2015			0

@entity11 is now accepting proposals for missions to explore @entity15 's moon
they are looking to do the mission for less than $ 1 billion ( £ 590 million )
@entity7 is thought to be one of the most likely places for alien life
beneath its icy surface is a subsurface ocean protected from radiation
but to date only a few spacecraft have studied the frozen satellite
a new mission could orbit the moon and even dive under the surface
