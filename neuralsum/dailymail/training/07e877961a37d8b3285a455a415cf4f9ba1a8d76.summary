he was diagnosed with @entity38 - a totally unrelated illness to @entity9 physically , @entity0 is unable to sit up on his own now with the disease robbing him of his gross motor skills ms @entity43 said while @entity0 was n't facing any mental challenges just yet , he could have similar problems to older people with @entity2 's in the near future			1
but there 's actually no way of knowing what 's in store for @entity0			1
@entity9 is so rare there 's only about 15 recorded cases in @entity54			1
there is currently no cure and the disease is always fatal			1

it was horrendous , it was n't great , ' ms @entity43 said			0
' he knows he 's sick but he does n't understand , we do n't even understand			0
' before he was diagnosed with leukaemia , he was pretty good but not perfect			2
he was younger so the gap was n't as wide as it is now in terms of development			0
' in those 12 months he was in hospital getting chemotherapy , we took our eyes off the physical deterioration ( due to his other illness ) , so it 's difficult to see how he 's changed			1
' @entity0 's family : @entity97 , @entity23 and their three children @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity0 are remaining positive doctors initially said @entity0 , pictured here with his dad @entity104 , would not live past 18 months the ' cheeky ' fou - year - old spent basically all of last year in hospital undergoing chemotherapy and has been in and out of hospital this year his parents @entity110 and @entity97 remain positive despite the difficult times they 've faced			1
