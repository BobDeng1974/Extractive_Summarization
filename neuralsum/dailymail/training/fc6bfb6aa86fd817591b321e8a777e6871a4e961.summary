@entity1 , the second fastest @entity12 in history after @entity14 , admitted it would be an underachievement if he fails to win a medal in the 100 metres final in @entity18 on wednesday evening			1
ambitions : @entity1 wants to help see in an era of @entity4 sprinting dominance starting in @entity18 ‘ i ’m going into the competition as the second ranked ( behind @entity24 ’s @entity23 ) so , on paper , i should pick up a medal			2
that ’s what expected of me			0
’ the 26 - year - old ran 9.91sec in 2013 but has struggled with a hamstring injury and has only competed three times this year			1
his first challenge will be proving he is physically durable enough to advance through the rounds unscathed			0
‘ i feel like my late start to the season has worked to my advantage , ’ said @entity1 , ‘ i ’m quite fresh and i ’ve still got a lot to give			0
it took four or five races last year to reach my peak			0
‘ i fancy there will be quite a few @entity4 men on the podium in the 100m and the 200m , ‘ seeing me and @entity45 go sub- 10 and a number of guys go 10.1 ( sec ) and lots of medals at the @entity50 , you just want to continue this on			1
multi-talented : @entity52 will go in the 200m in @entity18 after his 100m success in @entity55 ‘ confidence is high and we believe we can beat the best in the world and challenge the @entity8 and @entity9			1
i think it ’s important we continue to win medals in the sprints and relays to grow that confidence			0
’ @entity1 was overlooked for selection for @entity66 at the @entity50 and watched on tv as @entity52 , 20 , won a silver medal in the 100m , splitting @entity8 @entity70 and @entity71			1
@entity72 will run in the 200m in @entity18 , while @entity73 will compete alongside @entity74 and @entity75			1

he ’s a championship performer and he produced on the day			0
’ @entity1 said he was a ‘ better athlete ’ now than when he ran 9.91sec last year but claimed he was not thinking about breaking @entity14 ’s @entity4 record of 9.87sec , which has stood since 1993			2
his main opposition in @entity12 will be @entity24 ’s @entity23 , who clocked 9.95sec in may			2
@entity85 : @entity75 celebrates success in @entity55 during the @entity50 ‘ i never really think about times but @entity4 sprinters are expected to pick up medals at the @entity90 if you want to compete against the best in the world			1
’ on the back of his @entity50 gold medal , @entity94 said he was prepared that he might have to beat his own @entity4 long jump medal to win gold again in @entity18			1
@entity94 recorded a jump of 8.51 metres in @entity100 in @entity101 in april			0
‘ i have not been jumping like that since , ’ he said , ‘ but i caught one at the @entity104 which filled me with confidence			0
i might have to go 51 ( to win in @entity18			2
@entity106 ( from @entity107 ) jumped 56 last year and if he ’s on point it can happen ‘ apparently the track is amazing , so from that point of view it could be a very exciting competition			0
’ sprint kings - almost : the @entity66 boys celebrate with silver medals at the @entity50			1
