it was @entity13 's first ' outstanding ' rated @entity8 the unnamed employee also claims the school has been attempting to introduce @entity6 studies on to the curriculum , it is believed			1
this is not the first time the @entity18 has received a complaint about the school			1
in 2013 @entity14 was informed the school ruled female students were not to be taught tennis by male teachers			2
today , the department said they were aware of the concerns surrounding the school and they will take firm action is any breaches of statutory public sector equality duty are found			2
the case will no doubt draw comparisons to controversies surrounding @entity13 's first @entity53 free school - the @entity45 in @entity54 , which will now stop teaching in summer			1
the government was forced to step in after an @entity14 report warned the academy in @entity54 was in chaos			1
the schools inspectorate report detailed concerns over quality of teaching and the curriculum at the academy , amid claims it was imposing strict @entity6 practices such as forcing women to wear headscarves			1
schools minister @entity69 said at the time : ‘ it would simply not be in the interests of parents or pupils at the secondary school to continue to fund provision which has failed them in the manner now apparent			2
’ a source in @entity81 told @entity82 the @entity18 did not want the school to ' become another @entity84 '			1
they added the department were keen to make sure the school was still viewed as one of the best in the country			2
@entity91 , @entity92 's executive head , said faith classes were being organised - but for after school lessons			2
she said it was a ' safeguarding issue ' for children being hit in local madrasahs			0
she said a large number of @entity53 worked among a mixed workforce at the school			2
she did however admit the school 's governors ruled female pupils must only be taught my female teachers			2

' staff at @entity92 share in the passion for excellence and are committed to the success of all the children and families we serve			0
this commitment includes striving to ensure that all our policies and practices meet all required legislation and statutory guidance at all levels			0
@entity13 's first @entity53 free school - the @entity45 in @entity54			1
it will stop teaching this summer to concerns over teaching and the curriculum as well as claims women were being made to wear head scarves ' the misleading and inaccurate representations in the media are an unhelpful distraction from our core purpose which is to enable the pursuit of excellence , recognition of abilities and talent , and the realisation of ambitions for all of our learners			1
' in so doing , we aspire to break the link between demographics , deprivation and destiny			0
in addition we would like to make the following clarifications with respect to the allegations in the media			0
' in common with the majority of secondary schools , @entity163 at @entity164 is taught in single - gender groups and by same - gender teachers			0
the job role of a teacher of @entity163 is often advertised as gender - specific and is exempt under schedule 9 part 1 of the @entity173			0
all other subjects are taught by male & female teachers without regard to gender			0
' @entity92 follows the @entity179 in years 7 & 8 and then from year 9 , pupils are prepared for the @entity180 in @entity181			0
' @entity92 strictly complies with its recruitment policy which is fully compliant with legal requirements and is observant of fairness and meritocracy in process and practice			0

all state schools must comply with the statutory public sector equality duty			0
' we will not hesitate to take firm action if breaches of these requirements occur			0
it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage			0
