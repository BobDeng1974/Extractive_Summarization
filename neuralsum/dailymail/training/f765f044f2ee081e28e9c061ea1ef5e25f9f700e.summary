@entity0 are considering an early @entity2 call - up for @entity5 ’ new , uncapped @entity4 prop , @entity3 - who is eligible and has revealed his desire to push for selection			1
the 28 - year - old known as ‘ k - bomb ’ joined the north @entity11 club from @entity13 - based @entity12 during the summer , despite being told by @entity15 coach @entity14 that he was in contention for international honours			1
he has impressed in his first two @entity20 appearances for @entity5 and amid a dearth of established @entity23 tightheads , it is understood that he is being viewed as a candidate for @entity26 ’s national squad , to be named on october 22			1
@entity3 ( pictured ) of @entity5 could be fast - tracked into the @entity0 squad this november @entity28 ( left ) is interviewed by @entity30 's @entity29 and reveals it 'd be an ' honour ' to play for @entity0 with @entity33 ’s @entity32 due to miss the autumn internationals at @entity35 as he recovers from neck surgery , @entity37 of @entity38 is destined to continue as first - choice at @entity40			1
but behind him , stocks are low			2
@entity42 , is spending long periods on @entity38 ’s bench while developing his scrummaging , and @entity46 of @entity47 is another rookie with considerable raw potential who is still honing his craft			1
on monday , @entity0 forwards coach @entity51 was in @entity52 to watch @entity53 play for the @entity52 ’ reserves			1
despite being capped against @entity56 in june , the 24 - year - old is struggling at his club and has been demoted from the match - day 23			1
against this backdrop , @entity28 - whose maternal grandmother was born in @entity61 - has been identified as an immediate solution in a problem position			1
he is ready to answer the call , after belatedly discovering that he qualifies for @entity0			1
‘ the fact that i ended up finding out i am eligible to play for @entity0 is a bonus , ’ he told @entity30			1
‘ it is something i had never really thought of			0
my initial intention was to come over here , learn to be a better scrummager then after a few years go back and hopefully be one of the best tightheads in @entity15			2
then i could have another crack at it ( playing for @entity15 )			0
but whatever happens , happens			0
@entity4 - born tighthead prop @entity28 would be likely to back - up for @entity38 's @entity37 for @entity0 @entity32 is @entity0 's first - choice tighthead prop but he is sidelined for months following neck surgery @entity37 ( centre ) of @entity38 is likely to continue to deputise at @entity40 in @entity32 's absence for @entity0 ‘ i hold an @entity4 passport , but my nana on my mum ’s side was born in @entity87			1
i sort of knew it but i did n’t know what that meant in terms of eligibility			0
it ’s just one of those things - that was a good break for me i suppose			2
’ quite how much of a good break is only now dawning on @entity28			0
if he was a loosehead , he would be low down a long , high - class queue of @entity0 contenders , but at tighthead he is instantly in the mix. if @entity102 or @entity51 make contact , he wo n’t hesitate to make himself available			1
‘ it would be a massive honour to play for @entity0 , ’ he said			1
‘ there is a massive , proud history behind the team , so to be able to play for them would be something i would be very proud of			2
it would be another opportunity for me and i would want to take it			0
‘ it was good to play at @entity35 the other day			2
it would be an honour to play there for @entity0			1
when i was planning to come over here , i did n’t even know that i would be eligible , but afterwards it was spelled out to me			2
at the time i thought , @entity125 , whatever , that ’s not going to happen ”			0
but coming here now , maybe it is going to happen and that is pretty exciting			0
’ @entity0 would be pinching him from under the noses of the @entity15 - pool a rivals at next year ’s @entity132			1
@entity28 was in the mix to represent his country , but encouraging noises did n’t lead to caps , so he decided to try his luck elsewhere			0
@entity53 ( centre ) of @entity52 impressed in @entity56 but has struggled for his club @entity28 , pictured here tackling @entity0 captain @entity141 , moved to @entity5 this summer ‘ @entity14 came and spoke to me at training in pre-season , ’ he said			1
‘ then during the season i thought i was going well , but i did n’t hear anything else from them ( @entity15 )			0
when this opportunity came along i just thought , “ i could snap my leg in the next game , so i have to take this ”			0
‘ when i spoke to @entity151 ( @entity12 coach @entity152 ) and told him i was planning on doing it , he said , “ but you are on their ( @entity15 ’s ) radar ”			1
maybe i was on their radar , but there was a beaming light shining me in the face , coming from here			0
it was a massive opportunity and i could n’t just ignore that , hoping for something else to happen			0
’ in his early games for @entity5 , @entity28 has made a positive set - piece impact , despite finding the scrums markedly different to what he was used to @entity169			2
‘ guys are n’t afraid to attack on their own ball and on the opposition ’s ball , ’ he said			0
‘ i have only played four games here so far but already i ’ve had to deal with looseheads who love standing up and coming in			0
‘ in @entity15 we like to keep the scrum steady and straight , to have a good attacking platform off it , whereas here it is a real contest to go forward , see how much damage you can do , try to fracture them and get a penalty			0
it ’s a good contest			0
that ’s why i play the game - to have a battle with the other bloke and shake his hand at the end			2
’ a love of proper , combative scrummaging will go down well with @entity51			0
so far , @entity28 is doing and saying all the right things to advance his @entity0 prospects			2
@entity0 head coach @entity26 could fast - track @entity28 due to a crisis at tighthead prop the 28 - year - old has a love for combative scrummaging and likes to attack and push forward during set pieces			1

@entity0 *contemplated* fast - tracking @entity206 's prop @entity3
@entity4 - born prop moved to club this summer and is keen to play
the 28 - year - old is eligible as his maternal grandmother is from @entity61
@entity0 head coach @entity26 has an *injury* crisis at tighthead
@entity33 's @entity32 sidelined for months after *undergoing* neck surgery
@entity38 's @entity37 likely to continue at @entity40 but back - ups are limited
@entity3 told @entity30 it would be an ' honour ' to play for @entity0
