@entity0 found himself upstaged by @entity2 team - mate @entity1 and former @entity4 midfielder @entity3 on saturday night as @entity5 beat @entity6 2 - 1 in their international friendly			1
@entity0 , sitting on the bench with an ice pack on his left knee after being substituted on 76 minutes , could do little to turn @entity6 's fortunes around at the @entity5 after the hosts took a third - minute lead through @entity1 before @entity3 doubled their advantage in the second half			1
@entity6 substitute @entity17 set up a tense finale by slotting home a penalty for the visitors , but @entity5 held on to their slender advantage			1
@entity3 celebrates doubling @entity5 's lead in the second half as the hosts beat @entity6 in their international friendly on saturday @entity1 and his @entity5 team - mates celebrate after the home side took the lead at the @entity5 against @entity6 @entity3 celebrates with his @entity5 team - mates after coolly slotting home to make it 2 - 0 with about 20 minutes remaining in the match @entity0 sits on the turf frustrated as his @entity6 side suffer an early blow against @entity5 in the international friendly on saturday night @entity0 could do little to help @entity6 in the first half as @entity5 dominated the visitors in the impressive stadium near @entity40 @entity0 was seen with an ice pack on his knee after being substituted in @entity40 @entity5 : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity3 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity1 , @entity51 subs : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 bookings : @entity46 , @entity48 , goals : @entity1 ( 3 ) , @entity3 ( 69 ) @entity6 : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity0 , @entity76 subs : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity17 , @entity87 , @entity88 bookings : none goals : @entity17 ( @entity92 , 78 ) @entity5 wasted no time in dominating the visitors from the offset			1
a low cross from the left by @entity51 found @entity44 in space towards the back post , and the @entity99 defender forced goalkeeper @entity67 to palm his shot away			0
it did little good as the rebound fell to @entity1 who , with the goal gaping , tapped the ball in to make it 1 - 0 with just three minutes on the clock			2
replays on the big screen showed @entity0 turning away , looking frustrated to relinquish a lead so early in the international friendly			0
the former @entity4 star tried to trick his way beyond @entity5 's back line but his step - overs accomplished little during a less - than - convincing opening 45 minutes for the men in white			2
@entity51 , looking sharp for @entity5 , weaved his way through @entity6 's defence midway through the first half but a tame shot with the outside of his left foot was comfortably collected by @entity67			2
@entity6 , however , were nearly gifted an equaliser shortly before the break when @entity5 tried to pass their way out from the back			2
it was @entity76 who almost punished the hosts ' carelessness as the @entity4 winger , currently on loan at @entity132 , found himself with only goalkeeper @entity43 to beat			0
his shot across goal , seemingly in slow motion , went agonisingly wide of the right post and @entity5 's half - time lead remained intact			0
after the break , @entity0 looked hellbent on testing the @entity5 goalkeeper			0
the 29 - year - old , rising above surrounding defenders to meet @entity76 's cross , saw his header destined for the bottom - left corner , only for the right hand of @entity43 to deny the two - time @entity147 winner			0
@entity47 , starting the move from a standard throw - in on the left , found himself charging at goal before squaring the ball to @entity1			0
the striker in turn set the ball for @entity3 who , with a drop of the shoulder , simply tucked it away into the bottom - left corner to make it 2 - 0			1
again , @entity0 was shown on the big screen for the 81,000 present before being substituted with 14 minutes remaining			0
the man on in his place - @entity87 - immediately had an impact by winning a penalty from a trip by @entity3			0
another substitute , @entity17 , calmly slotted the resulting spot - kick beyond @entity43 to make it 2 - 1 with a little more than 10 minutes to play			1
it proved too little , too late for @entity6 , but those at the @entity178 will be more concerned by the strapping on @entity0 's left knee than the friendly defeat			1
@entity6 lost the international friendly 2 - 1 against @entity5 but @entity2 fans will be more keen to know more about @entity0 's fitness @entity0 was substituted on 76 minutes by @entity6 manager @entity184 on saturday night and immediately had his knee strapped @entity5 held on to their slender advantage after @entity6 struck back with a little more than 10 minutes remaining on saturday night			1
