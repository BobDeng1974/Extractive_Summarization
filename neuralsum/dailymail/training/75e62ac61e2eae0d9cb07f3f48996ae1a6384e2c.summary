by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 02:16 est , 26 september 2012 she threw her message in a bottle into the sea off the edge of @entity6 in the vain hope it might drift slowly to her aunt in @entity10			2
and when four - year - old @entity11 heard nothing from across the @entity13 she imagined it had been swallowed by a shark			1
but incredibly , five months later , her precious note hit land in @entity17 near @entity18 , southern @entity19 - 10,000 miles away from where it plopped in the water in @entity23 , where she was on holiday with her family			1
incredible : four - year - old @entity11 threw her message in a bottle into the @entity13 at @entity29 and it washed up on a beach 10,000 miles away in @entity19 @entity32 journey : the bottle took just five months to travel 10,000 miles from @entity33 all the way to @entity17 near @entity18 , southern @entity19 on the other side of the world grandmother @entity36 was strolling along the beach when she saw the bottle , read the note and wrote back to her new young penpal in @entity40 , near @entity41			1
to travel that distance her message must have travelled at an astonishing three miles an hour - or 2.6 knots - as it bobbed its way to the other side of the globe from @entity23			0
@entity11 ’s mother , @entity47 , had warned her daughter not to get her hopes up when she wrote the message back in april , at the family home before heading to @entity29 for their summer break			2
long haul : five months after it left her hands she got a mysterious letter in the post from the woman who found it lying on an @entity59 beach special : @entity36 wrote simply : ' as fate would have it we have been introduced by a message in a bottle ' ' @entity11 ’s grandparents had bought her a message in a bottle kit when they went on holiday as a present , ' mrs @entity11 said			1
hello from @entity19 ! @entity36 found the bottle and wrote back the the four - year - old and has pledged to stay in contact ' it ’s supposed to be a bit of a novelty , but we were going on holiday to @entity29 , so we thought we ’d fill it in and take it along			1
' @entity11 ’s aunt lives in @entity10 , so we said we ’d see if we could get the bottle to float a few miles across the channel			1
' never in our wildest dreams did we ever think it would get all the way to @entity19			0
' @entity36 found the little girl ’s note and wrote a reply straight back to her			2
her tender letter read : ' @entity11 , as fate would have it we have been introduced to each other by your message in a bottle , @entity88 looks very interesting			2
' i searched online on the computer to find out what i could , yes the pier exists and yes your address was there too			0
' your message in a bottle took five months to float up on @entity17 in @entity19			1
' my name is @entity36			0
my brother @entity105 and i were walking along the beach for some exercise collecting shells and reminiscing about our childhood when i saw your little bottle			0
' i scooped it up and we drove home with it where we opened it			0
i must share with you that i was so excited to find a message in a bottle			0
' i hope my note finds you well and brings you joy to know it has landed safely into my hands on the 13th of september 2012			0
off it goes : @entity11 readies herself to throw the bottle into the water at @entity29 in @entity23 - not knowing the incredible journey it would have sweet : @entity11 's message in a bottle kit was given to her by her grandparents and was aimed at a @entity10 landing ' if you would like to communicate just write and let me know you received my note			1
until then i wish you well , stay safe			0
' yours truly , @entity36 ' and @entity11 is now planning to start chatting to her new friend on @entity133 , and is writing her a special letter back , with some help from her mum			1
@entity11 said : ' i was really excited when i got a letter from @entity19			1
' i had forgotten that i had thrown the message in the sea			0
i thought it might have been eaten by a shark			2
' happy family : younger brother @entity143 , one , father @entity144 , mother @entity47 and @entity11			0

@entity11 *tossed* her note into the water at @entity29 hoping it would make it to her aunt across the water in @entity10
five months later she received a letter from @entity36 in @entity17 , @entity19 , to let her know it had hit land
' i thought it might have been eaten by a shark , ' @entity11 said after she heard nothing
the pair have now to become unlikely penpals and will chat online
