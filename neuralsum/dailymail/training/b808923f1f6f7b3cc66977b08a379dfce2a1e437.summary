@entity8 @entity7 , 29 , brought son @entity9 , eight , and daughter @entity10 , five , to live in @entity11 with him after the sudden death of their mother in their native @entity15			1
but despite mr @entity7 holding a @entity6 passport and having another son born in the @entity6 , under new immigration rules cracking down on asylum seekers claiming benefits , @entity9 and @entity10 can not stay here as they must be living in a family earning at least £ 22,500 a year			1
because mr @entity7 brings home only £ 120 a week and his fiancee is on maternity leave , the youngsters will be deported in march and are likely to be taken into care			1

the @entity4 says @entity9 and @entity10 ca n't stay in the country because their dad @entity7 does n't earn enough money a @entity15 social worker has now warned the father - of - three that his children could be at ' significant risk ' because they are white and maybe singled out for attack			1
today mr @entity7 , who lives with his children , fiancée @entity46 , 29 , their seven - month - old son @entity36 and @entity46 's daughter @entity48 , seven , in @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ' people ask why i do n't just go back to @entity15 but i have nothing out there and i will lose my family here if i go there			1
' here i have got a house , a job and i am settled and i do n't see why @entity9 and @entity10 ca n't settle with us too			1
' i am in a catch 22 but i will fight as much as i have to to keep my boys with me			0
' it is impossible for me to go back			2
' i just want to have my children here safe with me and yet i 'm being told that they are n't allowed to and that they will be put into care			1
the @entity7 family in @entity15			1
@entity64 , @entity7 's former wife , died suddenly in last year so their children had to move to @entity11 to be cared for by their dad ' all my family live in @entity11 , i have no one in @entity15 and no life there			1
' all i want to do is keep my family here safe and together			0
' @entity15 born mr @entity7 , whose mother was born in @entity6 , emigrated to the @entity6 five years ago to find work and a new life after he and his wife @entity74 split up			1
@entity9 and @entity10 lived with their mother in @entity77 on the @entity78 whilst he met @entity46 and she became pregnant with @entity36			1
but tragedy struck when @entity80 died in may last year and the youngsters moved in with their great grandparents , aged 75 and 70 , in a retirement complex			2
mr @entity7 said : ' they had to live with their mother 's grandparents but that was only temporary because they are old and the complex is for old people			1
' it made perfect sense for the boys to come and live with us in the @entity6 but whatever reason they have been refused permanent visas here			0
' one border agency person said we could bring the children over on my @entity6 passport and then apply for the children to get @entity6 passports when they arrived but another said we could n't			2
' apparently we needed to be earning £ 22,500 and then a further £ 2,800 for each additional child per year			0
we also needed to have more than £ 5k in savings			0
@entity7 's late wife @entity80 with their son @entity9 ' we have four children and are getting married in may this year it is not like we have money to spare			1
' i could understand if the children 's mum was still alive and we were wanting to bring them over but the circumstances are a lot different			2
' i am scared about what is going to happen when the day comes when they are meant to be on the flight back			0
@entity7 , @entity46 and @entity36 at home in @entity33 , @entity34 ' the youngsters have been registered at school and at the doctors surgery			1
' yet i have been told that an appeal can not be overturned , the @entity4 do n't answer my calls anymore and no one seems willing to help me			1
' i have tried to do everything by the book but do not know what else i can do			0
' @entity15 is a third world country and after speaking to a number of social workers , one turned around to me and said that the children going into care would be the last thing i 'd want to do			2
' she said that statistics show that one in five white children are raped or killed			0
' they become targets because they are different and the children can get separated			0
@entity7 pictured with @entity9 in @entity15 a few years ago during happier times ' they can not go into care in a third world country which has no money or resources			1
' it is very dangerous for white children in that environment			0
' @entity46 , who worked as a waitress before she had @entity36 , said : ' surely it is your basic human right to be able to keep your own kids			0
' we have been in touch with around 25 lawyers and immigration specialists but we have been passed from pillar to post			0
' we agree with tougher immigration laws but @entity7 has a good reason to be here in this country because he is a @entity6 citizen			2
' the children 's great grandparents are at an age where they ca n't support young children			2
despite holding a @entity6 passport ( pictured ) and having a third child born in the @entity6 , the @entity4 are trying to deport two of @entity7 's children according to the @entity4 @entity173 website a child is allowed to stay in the @entity6 if their mother or father lives here and the other parent has died			1
one of the listed requirements on the site for settlement in the @entity6 is if a ' parent is present and settled in the @entity6 and the other parent is dead '			0
' we have had a lot of sleepless nights			0
the children want to stay and are really happy because they are with their dad			0
' in a letter to the @entity6 authorities , the children 's great grandmother @entity188 , 70 , said : ' it has had a terrible effect on the children			0
' it manifests in their dreams as well as their every day lives			0
' they ca n't understand why they are not able to stay with their father and his family			2
' my husband and i can not raise them because we are pensioners and therefore do not have the financial means			0
' our ages also count against us			0
these two children need a healthy family life , there is no other family to stay with in @entity15			2
' @entity214 mp for @entity33 , @entity215 , said : ' it seems ridiculous that these little children ca n't just live with their father in the @entity6 who will care for them			1
' it is government policy that you have to be self sustainable hence the £ 22k figure but these are small children and would not be claiming any benefits			0
' the service they would be using would be education schooling and the @entity229 and then from schooling it would enable them to get jobs			0
' he is not bringing them to the @entity6 for the state to keep them ' we will be working hard to do everything in our power to stop these two young children being forced to go back to a country where they could face rape and child abuse			2
' a @entity173 spokesperson said : ' the safety and welfare of children is of paramount importance to the @entity173			0
' we will contact mr @entity7 to discuss his children ’s immigration status			1

@entity7 has been told his children will be deported next month
@entity9 , eight , and @entity10 , five , will be sent back to @entity15
@entity4 took the *decision* because mr @entity7 , 29 , does n't earn enough
they began living with their father in @entity33 , @entity34 after their mother died
