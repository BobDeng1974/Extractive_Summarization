tolerant : remarkably , the large , smelly animals seemed quite happy in such close proximity to each other ; those under several others did n't appear to mind photographer @entity19 said male sea lions average over 600 pounds in weight while female sea lions are just over 200 pounds @entity42 soup : ' other than keeping clear of the pier , staying upwind of these massive creatures is also a good idea , ' said mr @entity19 ' there are so many of them on the pier that , in some places , they are sleeping on top of each other , ' he said			0
the photographer said male sea lions weigh an average of over 600 pounds , while female sea lions are just over 200 pounds			0

' people are advised to keep away from the pier in @entity26 , @entity4 , which becomes a home for the sea lions every year he said aside from making an impressive photo , he advised steering clear of the pier , especially being down - wind of the animals			1

' stay clear : kayakers are warned to keep away from the sea lions which weigh more than twice the average weight of a person fishing boats moored alongside the pier must board their boats with acre so as not to disrupt the lazy harem of sea lions			2

*dozens* of lazy sea lions clambered over each other to find a *comfortable* spot on @entity26 pier , @entity4
