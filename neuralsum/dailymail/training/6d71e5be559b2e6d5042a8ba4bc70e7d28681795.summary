by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 02:34 est , 21 february 2013 owners of expensive homes could face a double death duty under plans proposed by @entity5 - pictured on the @entity7 campaign trail owners of expensive homes could face a double death duty under plans proposed by @entity5			1
the @entity10 leader wants to force families to pay a tax of one per cent a year on the value of homes over £ 2 million			1
but pensioners who bought their home years ago for a much lower price and who can not fork out the cash will be able to defer paying the ‘ mansion tax ’ until after their death			1
families could see their estates whittled down as they would pay potentially tens of thousands of pounds on top of inheritance tax at 40 per cent for amounts over £ 325,000			1
anyone with an expensive home who loses their job will also be able to defer paying the tax - but only for two years			1
mr @entity5 unveiled the policy when speaking to a man with a costly home on the deputy prime minister ’s weekly phone - in radio show on @entity38 ’s @entity37			2
the caller , who only gave his name as @entity41 , said he had bought a home in @entity43 , @entity38 , two decades ago			2
the price had ‘ skyrocketed ’ and it was now worth an ‘ obscene ’ £ 5 million , he said but he could not afford the £ 30,000 a year ‘ mansion tax ’			1
‘ i work hard , i earn a reasonable salary			0
i do not earn as much as mr @entity5 but i ’m happy with what i earn , but no way could i afford to buy a house now for anything like £ 5 million , ’ he said			0
a mansion tax would force him from his home as he could not afford the extra £ 30,000 a year tax			1
‘ this would take my total tax rate to 78 per cent			2
so my only option would be to sell the house that my family and i have lived in for 20 years and to withdraw my children from school			0
’ but mr @entity5 , who owns a home worth £ 1.5 million in @entity63 , south west @entity38 , revealed his plans for an inheritance tax blitz			2
he suggested the caller sold his home or pay the tax on his death			1
‘ of course you could make exceptions for those people who have lived in properties for a long period of time and have retired and obviously are n’t in a position to pay that kind of levy every year , ’ he said			2
‘ you could pay it as part of your estate , for instance			0
’ but chancellor @entity81 has ruled out adopting the @entity10 policy of a mansion tax , warning it lead to intrusive revaluations of every home in the country , not just expensive ones mr @entity5 has defended the policy , however , saying he did not want to ‘ clobber ’ people who were ‘ asset rich but cash poor ’ , so they would allow them to defer the payment			1
mr @entity5 also triggered fury when he suggested to the caller that he sells the home ‘ because you would be millions of pounds better off because you ’ve got a small mortgage from 20 years ago and that is in a sense , pure profit			0
’ chancellor @entity81 has ruled out adopting the @entity10 policy of a mansion tax , warning it lead to intrusive revaluations of every home in the country , not just expensive ones			1
but the @entity105 have also been criticised for reneging on their pledge to increase the inheritance threshold to £ 1 million			0
this has now been frozen at £ 325,000 per person until 2019			0
a source close to mr @entity5 said that he stood by his policy			0
‘ @entity5 leads by example , when he sold his @entity114 constituency home he gave the £ 30,000 profit back to the taxpayer			0
’ the source said the @entity117 were supportive of the policy			0
however @entity119 has said it will introduce a mansion tax if it wins the next election , prompting mr @entity5 to accuse @entity119 leader @entity122 of ‘ blatant plagiarism ’ .			0
