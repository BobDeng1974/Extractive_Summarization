home to around 2,000 people , the island , which measures just eight square miles survives on its laid - back brand of tourism , with other attractions including hiking , rock - climbing or simply flopping on its bow - shaped beaches			1
averaging at around 500,000 visitors last year , the island recently started to gain popularity , and was voted @entity58 's number one island on trip advisor for two years in a row			2
but despite an influx in backpackers and travellers desperate to taste its brand of bliss , it had n't lost its charm			0

according to the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , as many as 11 @entity33 have been murdered in @entity31 since 2009			1

the latest murder is a further setback for @entity31 's tourism industry which is still recovering from the military coup which took place in may this year			2
' the locals have made a conscious effort to maintain the beauty of the island whilst encouraging the life blood that is tourism			2
' backpackers also use it as a safe haven to recuperate from the @entity185 on @entity20			0
it 's one of the most relaxing places that i visited on my travels			0
' @entity190 slows to a crawl and the laid back vibe is very infectious			2
it 's the sort of place you 'll plan to visit for a week and end up staying a month			0
' it 's also , in my opinion , one of the safest places i visited			0
with it being such a small island , it 's very easy to see that there 's a family mentality among both the locals and the tourists			2
' @entity206 haven : accommodation ranges from basic to five - star - and can be as cheap as £ 4 per night ' @entity190 slows to a crawl and the laid back vibe is very infectious ' : no wonder backpackers flock to @entity8 but the increase in young travellers wanting to party , is unnerving to some			1

most of the @entity257 are travelling in couples or families			0
' i think there is a number of factors at play here : younger crowds , more people - which means more problems , and no real limitation or age check on drinking age on the island			1
' there 's also just a small number of police			0
i think they have only seven on the island			0
' this crime has shaken the island @entity282 were some petty thefts and bar fighting before , but mostly it happened to the local people			0
