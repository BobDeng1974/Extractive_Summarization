every family in the country will be left £ 350 worse off if the @entity3 is left calling the shots in a @entity6 government , @entity2 claimed today			1
the chancellor warned of a ' dangerous cocktail ' if @entity9 is at the mercy of @entity3 leader @entity11			1
with polls showing no party will win an overall majority , mr @entity2 claimed it would spark a ' constitutional crisis ' if @entity18 nationalist mps held the balance of power in the @entity21 government			1
she demanded her mps have a say over the running of the whole of the @entity21 , raising the prospect of @entity18 nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border			1
and she unveiled a £ 140billion ' ransom note ' for @entity21 to drag @entity6 to the left , including an end to austerity , rising benefits payments and the abolition of @entity42 as the price mr @entity9 would have to pay for getting into @entity44			1
mr @entity2 seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that @entity49 analysis suggests it would add £ 6billion to @entity21 's interest bill , worth £ 350 per family			2
mr @entity2 told @entity52 's today programme : ' it 's a new feature of this election that a @entity6 can not win an overall majority , so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of @entity59			2
' we 've got a strong plan for a national recovery , but it 's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what @entity65 described last night as ' constitutional chaos '			0
' the @entity69 leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a @entity6 minority government propped up by them			1
' @entity72 boasted that he would write @entity6 's first budget because the @entity3 would hold the balance of power he said global investors warn that an @entity3 - @entity6 deal ' will lead to higher market interest rates , which means higher mortgage rates for families , which means higher bills , cut incomes , it means businesses finding it more difficult to expand '			1
he added : ' let 's take one of @entity87 's largest banks , @entity88			0
they say a @entity6 government supported by the @entity3 would lead to a dangerous cocktail where taxes are going up , spending is going up , interest rates are going up			1
' they have been joined by @entity95 , the @entity97 investment bank , @entity98 , which is the largest pension fund in the world , @entity101 , the largest @entity103 banks			0
these are pretty unsentimental people			0
' these are economists and investors who make a living predicting what is going to happen to different economies around the world			2
and this week they have come out in a chorus to point out the consequences for the @entity21 of departing from the economic plan we 've pursued			2
' the warnings come after former @entity3 leader @entity72 boasted : ' i 'm writing @entity6 's budget			1
' the former @entity18 first minister , who is set to be one of up to 50 @entity120 elected next month , was filmed at a rally mocking @entity6 's weakness north of the border			1
he highlighted comments by the shadow business secretary @entity124 – who tried to downplay claims the @entity18 could avoid spending cuts by saying the party 's leader north of the border @entity127 ' will not be in charge of the @entity21 budget '			1
but mr @entity72 boasted that he already knew this – because that job would fall to the @entity3			2
he said : ' @entity6 's financial secretary said the @entity134 will not be writing the @entity6 budget			2
i knew that already , because i 'm writing the @entity6 budget			2
' labour leader @entity9 today warned voters in @entity18 that every mp @entity6 does not win north of the border makes a @entity141 government more likely it prompted @entity142 and @entity143 to join forces to warn of a looming ' constitutional crisis '			1
mr @entity142 said : ' you have now got @entity72 saying he wants to write @entity9 's budget			2
that 's before this has even happened			0
imagine how much worse it would be , imagine how many pockets would be picked if this were to happen			0
' mr @entity143 warned it would mean ' truckfuls of taxpayers ' dosh growling up the @entity157 to @entity18 '			0
mr @entity9 today warned voters in @entity18 that every mp @entity6 does not win north of the border makes a @entity141 government more likely			1
he told @entity162 's @entity161 : ' it 's either a @entity6 government or a @entity141 government after the election			2
' and every one less @entity6 mp means it 's more likely that @entity142 will be the prime minister again			1
people have to make their choice , but we will keep fighting that big argument about how we can create a better @entity18 for working people and a better @entity21			1
' challenged about why he is not willing to work with the @entity3 , he added : ' the reason why i am not going to have a coalition with the @entity18 national party is we have got fundamental differences			1
' and the most fundamental difference of all is they still want to break up the country			0
' they have ruled out having another referendum on independence within the next five years			0
' they used to say it was once in a lifetime			0
when you have got those big , big differences i ca n't see how having a coalition with them			0
' the @entity189 will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential @entity6 - @entity3 power - sharing deal by unveiling the party ’s first ‘ manifesto for @entity193 ’			1
mr @entity195 is expected to warn that @entity193 risks being ‘ held to ransom ’ by @entity59 unless @entity6 agrees to implement such a reform			0
the manifesto is also expected to commit the @entity189 to dozens of new road schemes in @entity193 and an extension of the @entity201 , which pays for expensive cancer treatments on the @entity203			0
inflammatory : prime minister @entity142 ( left ) will be joined by @entity195 ( right ) as they launch the @entity207 manifesto - with the latter expected to warn @entity193 risks being ' held to ransom ' by @entity3 the document will be seen as an attempt by the @entity189 to tap into growing @entity207 nationalism			0
opponents are likely to criticise it as risking fostering division between the @entity21 ’s four nations			0
but a @entity141 strategist said : ‘ we have separate @entity18 , @entity217 and @entity219 manifestos			0
why should n’t there be one for @entity193 ? ’ the ‘ @entity207 votes ’ plan would seek to resolve a longstanding constitutional question which will become more urgent than ever once the @entity224 is handed yet more powers			0
mr @entity195 wants to strip @entity18 mps of the power to impose tax changes , education and health reforms on @entity193 , given @entity224 will soon control all these issues in @entity18			0
the reform would make it impossible for any future @entity6 government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in @entity193 without winning the support of a majority of @entity207 mps			1
tensions : the manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the @entity189 and nationalist parties like @entity11 's @entity3 and @entity245 , led by @entity246 it could also make it difficult for a @entity18 mp to again hold the office of chancellor or prime minister , given they would be unable to vote on some of their own @entity254 ’s legislation			1
for decades , @entity6 has relied on the votes of its power base of @entity18 mps to rule @entity259			1
but since the creation of the @entity224 , critics have questioned how it can be right for @entity18 mps to have the crucial say on issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents			0
both reforms passed under @entity271 ’s government thanks to the votes of @entity6 ’s tartan army of @entity120			2
mr @entity195 is expected to say that the scale of devolution now to be given to @entity18 means the question of the status of @entity18 mps at @entity259 is unavoidable .			0
