by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 16:36 est , 8 august 2013 @entity1 has revealed that he was paid more than a million dollars by @entity2 after his news show was cancelled by the cable network			0
the pricey pay - out was only confirmed on thursday after @entity1 succumbed to pressure from his opponent in the @entity9 comptroller 's race to release his tax returns			1
the latest move still did n't satisfy all critics , however , as he did not make his tax returns from 2011 and 2012 public , instead allowing one @entity14 reporter to go over to his office and look through them while @entity1 was at his side			1
opening up ( somewhat ) : @entity1 has revealed how he made millions since resigning from office in 2008 , including a massive salary from @entity2 , a salary from his parents real estate company and book royalties though he resigned from office in 2008 after he was caught meeting with prostitutes , the years since leaving the governor 's mansion have been profitable ones for the @entity26			2
@entity1 and his wife @entity27 are living separately , though they still file their financial documents jointly meaning that they have not legally split up			0
in 2012 , @entity1 and @entity27 made a combined $ 4.27million as she earned six - figure sums from her salary while he brought in paychecks from a variety of different sources			1
@entity27 earned $ 125,325 in 2012 from her work at a private equity firm though that was a nearly 50 per cent pay cut from her earlier job			2
she earned around $ 250,000 while working at a hedge fund in 2011			0
meanwhile , @entity1 receives a $ 180,000 annual salary from his work with his father 's high - end real estate company			0
joining in : the tax returns show that @entity27 , seen here entering @entity1 's office building on wednesday , is living apart from her husband but they are still filing joint tax returns since that lowpoint : @entity1 resigned from governor in 2008 and has had a number of sources of income ever since he also brought home $ 10,000 from his teaching work at the @entity55 in 2011 and less than half that in 2012			1
sales from his books , speaking fees and consulting work produced a combined $ 50,000 in 2012			1
all of that work marks only a fraction of his total income , with @entity2 's hefty payout marking the vast majority of his earnings			0
@entity1 co-headlines a show on the cable news network that was cancelled in 2011 after only 10 months on the air			0
between 2011 and 2012 , he was paid $ 2million from the channel , over $ 1million of which came after the show stopped airing			2
@entity1 's reluctance to release the full details of his family 's financial dealings comes in contrast to his previous stance on the issue , as the disgraced former @entity81 governor criticized @entity82 for failing to reveal his tax returns during the 2012 presidential election			1
given that , @entity1 may also be embarrassed by the fact that his charitable giving - he and @entity27 gave $ 154,925 to charitable causes during the two - year - time period - is paltry compared to that of his former target			0
on the trail : @entity1 's main opponent publicly released five years of tax returns , and repeatedly called on the former governor to do the same but he only ended up showing one reporter two years of returns @entity96 reported during the election that @entity82 and @entity98 gave 29.4 per cent of their income away ( which added up to $ 4,020,772 in charitable donations ) as compared to the @entity1 's 3.6 per cent			1
the @entity14 also describes cost source as his ' modest ' household help , as he spent $ 60,000 for their unspecified number of household employees			0
@entity1 's rival released a full five years of returns while @entity1 only showed the @entity14 reporter two years ' worth			1
if @entity1 released five years , that would include ' it â€™s unfortunate that it took an entire month of public pressure to force @entity1 to release two years of his tax returns , and notable that he still refuses to release the remaining three years , ' said @entity114 , the spokeswoman for @entity115 .			2

disgraced former governor now running to be the next comptroller of @entity9 and showed a reporter his tax returns for the past two years
he and his wife made a combined $ 4.27million in 2012
his overall net worth is *unknown*
