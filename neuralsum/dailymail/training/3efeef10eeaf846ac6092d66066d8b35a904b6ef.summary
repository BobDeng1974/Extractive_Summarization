@entity0 says he wants ordinary voters to be able to take part in their own version of prime minister ’s questions to reinvigorate @entity7 politics the public could be given the chance to grill the prime minister every week in @entity11 if @entity0 wins the next election			1
the @entity14 leader said he wants ordinary voters to be able to take part in their own version of prime minister ’s questions to reinvigorate @entity7 politics			1
but the plan risked backfiring , because only those willing – and able – to travel into central @entity20 would ever stand a chance of taking part			2
and just a year ago @entity14 complained about the cost of @entity26 's events taking questions from the public across the country			1
in the latest stage of mr @entity0 ’s summer relaunch , he revealed he is in talks with commons speaker @entity34 about staging regular public q&a sessions in @entity36			1
' i think what we need is a public question time , where regularly the prime minister submits himself or herself to questioning from members of the public in the @entity45 on wednesdays , ' he told @entity47 's @entity46			0
' why is that important ? because i want to let the public in to our politics			2
' at the moment there is the glass that separates the public in the gallery from the @entity56 , but there is a gulf miles wide between the kind of politics people want and what prime minister 's questions offers			2
' however , @entity65 insiders were quick to point out that @entity26 has been taking part in regular question and answer events for more than eight years			1
in opposition they were known as @entity70 , and since taking power the @entity72 events have been held in factories , warehouses , offices and community halls across the country , @entity80 leader @entity79 , the deputy prime minister , also subjects himself to weekly grillings on his radio phone - in on @entity83			1
mr @entity0 admitted his plan was in part inspired by the success of mr @entity79 ’s broadcasts			1
' he got a whole load of bile about it when he did it and i remember saying to people ' actually , it 's good thing to do '			0
' i will do that in terms of radio phone - ins but i want to do more			1
' mr @entity0 argues that the weekly bouts in the @entity100 chamber leave voters detached from the political process @entity14 said it hoped the @entity103 would be held at least once a fortnight and possibly weekly in @entity11 if the speaker allows it			1
people asking the questions ‘ would be chosen by a method to ensure a wide representation of the country and political backgrounds ’			0
those invited ' would not just be cheerleading @entity14 supporters ' , mr @entity0 insisted			1
embarrassingly , a year ago @entity14 criticsed mr @entity26 for holding @entity114 sessions with voters			1
in two years , the cost of 12 pm direct events came to £ 50,000 , which @entity14 mp @entity118 was ' a lot of taxpayers ' money to be wasting on what are essentially publicity events '			2
however , @entity14 insisted what mr @entity0 was proposing was a ' formal ' chance to hold the prime minister to account , and not just a campaign event			2
@entity65 said it would consider the idea , but raised doubts about how voters from places like @entity133 , @entity134 or @entity135 would get to @entity20 to take part			0
a @entity138 spokesman said : ' the prime minister is open to new ways of engaging with the public			0
he already holds regular @entity142 , where he takes questions from members of the public in towns and cities across the country			1
' but a government source added : ‘ @entity26 and @entity151 are talking about fixing the economy and getting people into work			0
@entity0 is talking about his image and tweaking parliamentary procedure ’			0
@entity80 leader @entity79 has been taking questions from the public for more than a year on his weekly radio phone - in @entity26 started holding @entity70 events in opposition , and they have continued since taking power , including this one at @entity164 in @entity165 in 2012 mr @entity34 's office said it would examine any proposals submitted by the @entity168 - which it said echoed similar reforms already submitted to a review			1
' the speaker will look at mr @entity0 's suggestions with interest , when he receives them			2
clearly , any changes would be a matter for the @entity56 , ' his spokeswoman said			0
' the speaker 's special @entity179 looking at the effects of the digital revolution on our democracy has received similar suggestions from people outside @entity11			0
' however , it is clear that within @entity36 there is also an appetite for further reforms to the way the @entity56 conducts itself			0
' mr @entity0 said voters ' deserve a better debate ' than one unduly focused on image			0
' this is n't @entity197 celebrity , this is n't an ugly person 's showbiz contest , this is about more than that			0
' he went on : ' i will talk about a different kind of leadership which has listening as part of leading			0
' he defended his decision to seek a chance to speak directly with @entity212 president @entity211 last week - rejecting suggestions it had been an example of the sort of ' trivial ' politics he criticised .			0

@entity14 leader says he wants weekly or fortnightly sessions in @entity36
@entity0 argues the plan is part of ' letting the public into our politics '
he is in talks with commons speaker @entity34 about the idea
but it would mean only those able to get to the *capital* can take part
@entity26 has been holding q&a sessions across the country for years
