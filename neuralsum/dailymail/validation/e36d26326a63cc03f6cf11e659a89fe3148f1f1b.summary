killer co-pilot @entity0 was able to hide his psychological problems from airline bosses because of a ' gaping hole ' in the system for assessing pilot health , an air safety expert has claimed			1
@entity0 had torn up a sick note declaring him unfit to fly on the day he crashed a @entity9 plane into a rocky ravine in the @entity11 , killing himself and everyone on board			1
the 27 - year - old is believed to have consulted medics about severe psychological and visual disorders and been told he was too ill to fly by two doctors before the crash			1
but due to confidentiality rules , this information was not passed onto @entity22 operator @entity21 and he was able to fly the doomed @entity24 that day			1
the onus of reporting any health issues rests solely on the ' honesty ' of pilots			1
@entity45 , a @entity37 pilot who has flown @entity46 for 20 years and who also works as a @entity49 examiner , said that the system ' has to change '			1
' it 's a gaping hole in the system			0
it would happen in the @entity37 as well , ' he said			1
' as a pilot , my medical life at work and my medical life at home are absolutely separate , unless i choose otherwise			2
nobody checks that you communicate your health problems to the airline			1
' pilots have a yearly medical examination , which includes a chat about how we 've been feeling psychologically , but it 's fairly low - key			1
' if i go to the gp , there it no requirement for me to disclose that i 'm a pilot			2
' and if i see the doctor for something that may affect my ability to perform my duties , he is prevented from communicating that to the airline because of medical confidentiality			1
' the onus is on me to hold my hands up and tell the aviation authorities			2
the system is not well policed			2
a simple headstone has been laid in @entity87 , the closest accessible site to the area of the crash flowers have been laid at the headstone , known as a stele , to remember those who died in the crash ' there is a legal obligation for pilots to tell their employers if they have surgery , or an illness that requires more than 21 days off work , or have been prescribed a long list of certain drugs			2
' but the gp does n't get involved			0
' @entity0 had visited @entity104 in february and more recently on march 10 and is believed to have been concerned about vision problems			1
an ex-girlfriend claimed he had always dreamed of flying larger planes but had recently recognised his ambition could not come true because of his mental health problems			1
the co-pilot had previously been treated by psychiatrists for ' burnout syndrome ' which required him to take a break from pilot training in 2009			2
he was allowed to complete his training in 2013 and get a pilot 's licence , under the condition he had regular medical exams			2
but it appears that because of confidentiality laws governing gps , @entity21 would not have been informed about @entity0 's struggles unless he told them himself			1
@entity125 gendarmes have been at the crash site , recovering clues and body parts from the wreckage dozens of search workers have been deployed by helicopter because the crash site is so inaccessible officials confirmed that @entity0 's remains have already been found , and not a single body had been recovered mr @entity45 added : ' i 'd like to see a more robust mechanism			1
most pilots do n't go around intentionally exploiting it , but the door is open for someone who has serious mental problems to hide it from the aviation examiner			1
' it also leaves the door open for mistakes			1
' a pilot friend of mine quit smoking with help from a drug prescribed by his gp			0
' he mentioned it casually to the airline examiners a few months later , and they told him he should n't have been flying under the influence of that drug			0
' he had no idea			0
if there had been a crash , it would have been appalling			0
' it 's very dangerous and the system needs to be tightened up			0
' @entity27 said it was unaware of any psychosomatic or other illness affecting the co-pilot			0
@entity29 newspaper @entity166 am @entity167 reported investigators had found evidence to suggest @entity0 was concerned he was losing his eyesight , possibly because of a detached retina			1
the condition causes the thin lining at the back of the eye to detach from blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients and is often marked by flashes in the eye			0
relatives of victims , including @entity184 ( centre ) have gathered at the site of the crash in @entity188 flowers and candles have been laid by mourners at the headquarters of @entity9 in @entity193 it causes blurred vision and without treatment can lead to blindness			0
the newspaper reported that it is unclear whether his vision problems had physical or psychological causes			0
@entity0 is believed to have locked pilot @entity203 out of the cockpit when he left to go to the toilet before he put the plane into a descent			1
black box recordings revealed that @entity203 hammered on the door asking to be allowed in , but @entity0 failed to answer			1
minutes later on tuesday morning the plane crashed into the @entity11 at a speed of 400mph , killing everyone on board			0
among the dead were three @entity37 - including a seven - month - old baby			2
since the tragedy a picture of @entity0 has emerged as a passionate and dedicated flyer who had previously struggled with a bout of depression			2
he was focused on flying , having joined a glider club when he was just 15			0
committed and ambitious , his former girlfriend @entity223 told @entity29 newspaper @entity166 that @entity0 had hoped to fly larger planes , such as the @entity227 jumbo jet			1
' she said that he recognised in the last month that his dream can not come true because of his mental illness , ' @entity166 reporter @entity228 told the @entity231			0
@entity0 's former girlfriend also said he would get ' angry ' about his conditions at work and struggled with the pressure of holding onto his job			2
she claimed she ended the affair because she realised the pilot had problems			0
@entity125 @entity241 members and residents living nearby have paid tribute to the 150 people killed in the crash while @entity223 claims to have been in a relationship with him , he shared his @entity250 flat with a woman who was believed to have been his fiancée			0
large quantities of prescription medicines for treating mental illness were found at his flat			0
as well as his passion for flying , he is believed to have been an avid runner - training for the @entity261 endurance rest in @entity262			0
@entity263 , the mayor of @entity264 , said he met the father of @entity0 at a memorial on thursday for relatives of those who died in the crash			2
' he was distraught with grief			0
he was a completely broken man who is carrying all the responsibility of this drama on his back , ' @entity263 said on @entity274			0
' he lost a loved one , but also because his son is perhaps the ( cause ) of this tragedy			0

co-pilot @entity0 tore up a sick note declaring him unfit to fly
confidentiality laws mean doctors could not disclose medical information directly to @entity21
in both @entity287 and the @entity37 , pilots are *supposed* to tell airlines if they have health problems , but this is not policed
a @entity37 air safety expert said , ' the door is open for someone who has serious mental problems to hide it from the aviation examiner '
