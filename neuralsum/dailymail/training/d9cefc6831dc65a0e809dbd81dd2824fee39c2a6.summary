by @entity0 and @entity1 the 12 - year - old @entity3 girl sensationally accused two years ago of killing a three - month old baby has agreed to a plea deal that will see her avoid the original charge of manslaughter			1
@entity9 when first charged in the death of three - month - old @entity11 in july 2012 , but will only have to admit to committing an unspecified misdemeanor to avoid spending the rest of her life in jail			1
@entity9 was found last year incompetent to stand trial by a state forensics investigator after multiple exams , according to the @entity20			1
the plea deal has been agreed to by prosecutors but still needs a judge 's approval			2
tragic : 12 - year - old @entity9 may escape a manslaughter charge for the 2012 death of 3 - month - old @entity11 ( pictured ) ' there will be admissions to lesser charges , ' deputy attorney general @entity27 told the paper			1
' the goal of this , which has been the goal from the very beginning , is that the juvenile will be subject to conditions and to counseling , supervision , treatment for a lengthy period of time , so that the issues that she has can be addressed , ' he added			0
the charges stem from a night in which the baby 's mother stayed over @entity9 's house with her baby while babysitting the then - 10 - year - old only to wake up and find her toddler dead			1
an autopsy and toxicology performed on the baby found large quantities of the same prescription medication @entity9 took to control her @entity56 ( @entity56 )			1
the deal comes after the baby 's mother @entity58 called for charges against @entity9 's mother @entity61			1
she said the woman was neglectful in watching @entity11 , and that she should be held liable for her conduct			2
' legally speaking , it ’s not possible , ' @entity27 said			0
' one of the things we have to prove in any death is causation , and we do n’t have any evidence that [ @entity61 ] caused anybody ’s death			2
' the juvenile petition against @entity9 contained no additional details about the case , including @entity78 's cause of death , but the baby 's mother , @entity58 , claims to have been told her child was suffocated			1
when @entity11 saw her daughter for the first time at a funeral home , the baby had a black eye , bruises on her nose and marks that looked like fingerprints on her cheeks , she said			2
' @entity11 has died as a result of your neglect , ' said a notice delivered to the mother in the weeks after her child 's death			1
' you knew that ( the 10 - year - old ) should not be babysitting children but have continued to allow her to do so			1
' deputy attorney general @entity27 told the @entity20 that prosecutors are not pushing for @entity9 to be tried as an adult , so she will not get a jury trial			1
if the case goes to trial a ruling will be made by a judge who deals with juveniles			2
but the deal tentatively agreed to is an effort to avoid even that			0
' nothing can bring back the baby , ' @entity61 's lawyer @entity112 told the paper			2
' the best we can do is look out for the well - being of my client ’s child			2
' gone too soon : @entity121 died while in the care of @entity9 and her mother @entity78 's mother , @entity124 , said traces of the 10 - year - old 's medication was found in her daughter 's system @entity9 had already been labeled as a danger to children before @entity11 's death , according to documents from the @entity133 which detail that she suffers behavioral problems , including oppositional defiant disorder , adhd and attachment disorder			1
former tenants of @entity61 's house also claimed @entity9 also harmed their baby			2
@entity141 and @entity142 have named the 10 - year - old as being responsible for their daughter 's hospitalisation in june , brought on by sudden seizures			1
doctors found the same medication in eight - month - old @entity150 's system that is used by the accused girl to control her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after they had been left alone together			1
@entity141 and @entity142 were living with in the basement of @entity61 's home , the @entity20 reported			2
they say the girl was alone with their daughter in june 2012 , while @entity142 was elsewhere in the house and @entity141 was out at work			0
the couple trusted the girl , they said , that she had shown a ' healthy interest ' in their daughter up until that point , offering to help with diaper changes and bathing			0
when @entity141 arrived home from her shift at @entity171 she found her daughter pale and sweating			0
' she was soaked in sweat , just drenched , ' said @entity141 , 20			0
' she was so pale			0
whiter than a sheet of paper			0
' as they rushed her to the emergency room at @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity150 began convulsing and fitting			0
' she was on her father 's lap , and her head just dropped back , and she rapidly started shaking , ' @entity141 said			0
' the first one lasted like 20 seconds			0
' the sudden seizures baffled doctors at first as they struggled to work out what had brought them on			0
medical experts consulted one another and @entity150 was transferred to @entity190 in @entity191 to be reassessed			0
shock : @entity141 ( left ) claims @entity9 was also responsible for her daughter @entity150 's ( right ) hospitalisation in june ' if her head went to the left her arm went to the right and vice versa , ' she said			2
' her heart rate was high and they were worried and did n't know what to do for her			0
' in @entity191 doctors probed @entity141 about what medications were in @entity61 's house , matching up the 10 - year - old 's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drugs with what they found in @entity150 's system			1
so much was detected , @entity141 said , that her daughter ' should have been dead '			0
she added that there ' was n't any way ' she could have ingested the medication on her own			0
in the days following the scare @entity141 and @entity142 began looking for a new place to live , sickened by the belief that @entity61 's daughter had deliberately hurt their own			0
she said she had found a canvas bag in a drawer in the 10 - year - old 's bedroom , filled with more than 100 photographs of @entity150 , some torn , others with words like ' my baby girl ' written on them			1
the couple were interviewed by workers from the @entity230 , as were with the 10 - year - old and her mother			1
all four were told that the girl should not be given care of young children			0
but despite the warnings the girl was once again left alone with a toddler just three weeks later , this time three - month - old @entity238 whose mother , @entity124 , had left in @entity61 's care overnight .			1

@entity9 was only 10 - years - old when first charged in the 2012 death of three - month - old @entity11 - @entity11
she was the youngest person charged with manslaughter in the state in more than 30 years
@entity9 will plead down to a misdemeanor after a mental *evaluation* ruled her incompetent to stand trial
@entity11 had traces of @entity9 's adhd medication in her system and may have also been suffocated
