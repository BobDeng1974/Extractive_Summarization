by @entity0 dark matter is one of the holy grails of astrophysics - for decades scientists have been trying to work out exactly what this invisible matter is			1
it ’s thought to make up the majority of the universe yet experts still do not understand what it is			2
a new study , however , using public data from @entity17 ’s @entity16 space telescope might finally provide some answers			1
this false - colour image of the centre of our @entity22 reveals excess gamma ray emissions that could be the result of dark matter particles colliding assistant professor @entity27 and his colleagues at the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , have been studying a signal at the heart of our @entity22 galaxy since 2009			1
consisting of a haze of gamma rays - extremely high energy radiation - the scientists are now convinced that the signal was produced by dark matter particles crashing into each other			1
as they destroy one another , these release gamma rays into space , giving rise to a perceivable glow at the centre of the @entity22			0
similar detections in nearby dwarf galaxies , those smaller than our own , could further suggest the theory may be correct			0
dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			1
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
the @entity68 says : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			0
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			0
' similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly			2
' scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			0
‘ this is the most compelling signal we ’ve had for dark matter particles – ever , ’ @entity27 told @entity87			1
to confirm their finding , the scientists had to rule out other possibilities for the signal , including the gamma rays being produced by a distant pulsar or rapidly spinning star			0
they found the gamma rays produced a sphere nearly 10,000 light - years wide around the galactic centre , ruling out the possibility of pulsars being the source			0
‘ that does n’t rule out things that no one ’s thought of yet , ’ @entity27 added			2
‘ but we ’ve tried pretty hard to think of something without success			0
’ if their findings turn out to be correct , it poses some tough questions about dark matter			1
previously , scientists had thought dark matter was made of a hypothetical particle known as a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp )			1
if dark matter is being produced and colliding at the centre of our galaxy , however , then it is much more likely to be a heavier particle			2
this would cast doubt on some of the previous evidence for dark matter we have from experiments on @entity133			2
if the detection found by @entity136 and his team is shown to match similar signals at the heart of other galaxies , it will more strongly suggest their findings are correct			0
@entity27 and his team used data from @entity17 's @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , in orbit since 2008 , to make their discovery if other galaxies are found to have similar signals at their centres it could could confirm the findings			1

@entity17 ’s @entity16 telescope suggests dark matter may be at heart of @entity22
study is ‘ most compelling signal we ’ve had for dark matter particles – ever ’
dark matter is thought to make up over *80* *%* of the universe but we know almost nothing about it
@entity165 could finally reveal what dark matter is made of
