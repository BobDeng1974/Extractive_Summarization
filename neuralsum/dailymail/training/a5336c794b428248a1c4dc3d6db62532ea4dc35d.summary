by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:36 am on 13th november 2011 the world is getting warmer			2
and scientists have got an alarming video to prove it			2
according to researchers from the @entity9 project ( @entity9 ) from @entity10 in @entity11 , the @entity6 's average global land temperature has risen by @entity12 since the 1950s			1
led by controversial physicist , professor @entity14 , they used data from 1800 to 2009 to present their ' irrefutable ' proof			1
however , mutiny within the best ranks has cast doubt on their findings - much to the delight of climate change sceptics			1
scientists at @entity10 , led by controversial physicist @entity14 , gathered a billion weather reports in the past 200 years professor @entity34 was one of ten experts attempting to compile the definitive temperature data			1
she claimed it had been ‘ tarnished ’ by @entity39 ‘ overselling ’ the results in favour of global warming - and she has threatened to quit the project			1
prof @entity34 , of the @entity43 at the @entity44 , in the @entity45 , said their data actually showed average world temperatures had ‘ paused ’ since the late 1990s			2
she also said that a graph published on the project ’s website depicting temperatures from 1850 to 2006 appeared to ‘ hide the decline ’			2
@entity6 's land surface temperature ( @entity9 ) data was taken from 1.6 billion temperature archived records dating back to the 1800s from 15 sources around the world			0
it shows deviation from the mean temperature over two centuries - and overall global warming since the industrial revolution			1
to highlight their findings , best researchers put all the data into one alarming video of a warming world visualising surface temperature records			1
how the @entity6 was in 1850 with huge swathes of the world cool fifty years on : @entity6 in 1900 starting to show signs of heating up ( just like the climate change debate would many years later ) the @entity77 in temperature matches estimates by the world 's respected climate watchers who maintain official records			0
these include the @entity85 with the @entity86 , @entity88 's @entity87 in @entity89 and the @entity90			0
prof @entity14 told the @entity91 : ' my hope is that this will win over those people who are properly sceptical			1
@entity95 apart : best team leader prof @entity14 , left , says the latest findings settle the climate debate once and for all			1
but prof @entity34 says such a claim is ' a mistake ' ' some people lump the sceptical in with the deniers and that makes it easy to dismiss them , because the deniers pay no attention to science			0
' @entity14 's survey - the biggest open database of temperature records - was focused on producing a transparent and independent assessment of global warming			1
global warming doubters have always criticised official figures on the grounds that many temperature stations are poor quality and that data is tweaked by hand			1
but the @entity6 study found that the so - called ' urban heat ' which makes cities warmer than surrounding rural areas , did not significantly contribute to average land temperature rises			0
rising temperature : the world in 1950			0
scientists wanted transparent data to counter doubts by climate change sceptics here we glow : the way the world was in 2000 with heat spots shown in burning red this , said the @entity91 , is because urban regions make up less than one per cent of the @entity6 's land area			2
and while ' poor ' stations might be less accurate , they recorded the same average warming trend the @entity45 team includes @entity146 , joint winner of this year 's @entity148 for the discovery that the universe is expanding at an increasing rate			2
it has gone public before publication by submitting four papers to the journal @entity156			0
@entity14 said : ' we have looked at these issues in a straightforward , transparent way , and based on that , i would expect legitimate sceptics to feel their issues have been addressed			1
' the research has won backing from @entity167 at the @entity168 in @entity169 and chair of the @entity171			0
he told the paper : ' this takes a very distinct approach to the problem and comes up with the same answer , and that builds confidence that pre-existing estimates are in the right ballpark			0
' @entity182 and transparency is a must , particularly now with climate change being so politicised			0
' but one @entity45 climate sceptic , @entity187 , claimed he had identified a ' basic procedural error ' concerning time periods used in the research , and urged the authors to revise the paper			0
and the project has been attacked by some climate bloggers , who point out that one of the sponsors runs a company @entity197 have branded a ' financial kingpin of climate science denial ' .			0

controversial physicist @entity14 *believes* his findings will ' address the issues of legitimate sceptics '
but he stands accused of ' overselling ' global warming
