by @entity0 click here for the latest @entity3 leaderboard masters champion @entity4 opened his defence here at @entity6 on thursday like a man with no intention of letting anyone rip the jacket off his back			1
all year the pride he felt in becoming the first @entity13 to win here was obvious , as he took the green coat — to use the @entity17 vernacular — on a world tour that culminated in a glorious homecoming down under last november			2
@entity4 has inspired his @entity13 peers to such an extent that they have won four of the last seven job well done : @entity4 looks happy after completing round one , finishing just one shot back great start : but @entity17 @entity27 leads the way , with a round of 68 at @entity3 respect : @entity27 was playing with @entity31 at the masters , and both played well now the main man is back , as he posted an impressive three - under - par 69 that left him just a stroke off the lead held by @entity17 @entity27			1
‘ i do n’t know how it felt to him but to me it looked like he had the ball on a string , ’ said @entity4 ’s playing partner , @entity46 ’s @entity45 champion @entity44			1
‘ he ’s got such a fantastic swing , it was a pleasure watching him			2
’ the only other player who draws compliments like this from fellow competitors is @entity52			1
all those hoping for the pair to be locked together come the final nine holes on sunday will have been encouraged by the sight of the @entity57 also taking his place on the leaderboard			0
the 24 - year - old finished with a 71 , which represented a good start on a devilishly difficult opening day			0
as so often this season , his driving was a thing of beauty but 34 putts told its own story of a round that was stunted by his work on the greens			1
still , the daunting nature of the set - up was illustrated by the fact only four players broke 70 , with @entity79 and @entity80 , the two men who contested the play - off in 2012 , finishing alongside @entity4			1
@entity79 , the winner on that occasion two years ago , was the only player in the 97 - man field to keep a bogey off his card			1
@entity52 began by booming drives on the opening three holes that all came to rest 320 yards from the tee on their respective fairways			1
hanging in there : @entity52 is well in contention on one under par @entity97 ( @ garyplayer ) : ‘ an honour to kick off @ @entity99 with @entity100			1
counting on blasting it long & straight			0
’ the @entity103 veteran joined @entity104 and @entity105 to hit the honorary tee shot			2
tiger woods ( @ @entity108 ) : ' it never gets old watching the honorary starters tee off			0
one of the oldest and best traditions in the game			0
' the injured world no 1 had to watch from the sidelines as this year 's tournament got under way			0
@entity116 ( @entity117 ) : ' not breaking us in gently with @entity120 pin positions here @ @entity99			0
some tough ones especially 5/10/16			0
' the @entity57 was spot on with his predictions and faced a struggle before finishing level par for the day			2
@entity126 ( @ warne888 ) : the masters starts today ! good luck to all the players , especially the @entity13 , maybe back to back @entity4 ? my tip is @ @entity132 ! ' former @entity13 spinner @entity126 was backing his fellow countryman @entity133 to follow up @entity4 's win last year			1
@entity135 ( @entity136 ) : made all my bets for live masters			2
i 've spread the love this year backing @entity52 , @entity79 and @entity140			1
the @entity46 batsman will be hoping his tips perform better than his cricket team have done recently			0
@entity144 ( @ @entity145 ) : ‘ it ’s masters time ! one of my favourite sporting events			2
backing @ @entity149 to win it this year ’ the @entity152 star backed @entity17 @entity153 , but fellow @entity155 @entity154 finished on five over			0
decent support : girlfriend and tennis star @entity157 was following the @entity57 could have been better : it was still a mixed day for @entity160 at the par - four third , that left him just a pitch on to the green and he duly knocked it close to set up his first birdie			2
another followed at the fifth but then came bogeys at the eighth and 12th			0
he found the green in two on both the par fives on the back nine to set up birdies but a three - putt at the 18th stung			1
still , as he reflected : ‘ this was a day when the course was set up so hard any score under par represented a good start			2
’ @entity52 thought the test a little different from the past , but the familiarity of the names at the top of the leaderboard suggested otherwise			1
after the monsoon on monday and unseasonably chilly weather to follow , dawn broke on masters thursday to a @entity188 peach of a day			2
the opportunity was clearly there to post a score and make a statement but the pin positions on the first day are usually brutal and here was no exception			0
much of the interest surrounded @entity52 and @entity4 , of course , who were out in successive groups			1
@entity4 made a spectacular start			1
a pushed drive at the first left him with only a narrow opening to squeeze his approach through if he was to find the green			0
fearless : @entity4 was showing no signs of nerves as he looked to defend his masters jacket uh-oh : the @entity13 had to take a drop at the @entity210 15th what a lesson : amateur playing partner @entity44 said it was a pleasure to watch @entity4 's swing he did that all right , provoking one of the loudest cheers of the early play when the ball pitched six feet from the hole and pulled up half that distance away			1
having achieved one unlikely birdie , @entity4 managed another at the short sixth , where the hole was positioned on a treacherous ledge			1
a more customary birdie for a man with his prodigious gifts off the tee followed at the long eighth to take him out in a tidy 33 strokes			0
a birdie at the 10th — the hole he also birdied last year to break the @entity13 curse in the play - off against @entity236 — took him to four under			0
the 12th hole at @entity3 is the shortest on the course , known as @entity239 , and how often it has tolled for players who appear to be moving through the gears			0
on this day the flag was located on the right , always the most dangerous spot			0
never go for this flag , advises @entity104 , but @entity4 gambled — and lost			1
his ball finished in the water and he failed to hole from six feet for a bogey			0
mixed emotions : @entity252 lead at one stage before finishing on two under , just like @entity254 mixed emotions : @entity252 lead at one stage before finishing on two under , just like @entity254 still going strong : @entity255 impressed beyond his years @entity4 also three - putted the long 13th for a disappointing par , before birdieing the 14th to continue his curious round where he birdied the holes you ’re supposed to par and parred the holes that offer obvious opportunities			1
‘ it showed how well i was playing that i only birdied one of the par fives and yet still shot 69 , ’ he said			1
seven players shot 70 , including @entity17 @entity252 and @entity254 , while alongside @entity52 on 71 was 54 - year - old @entity255			1
@entity266 is exactly the right word to describe him given that every time he puts on that green jacket and walks through the gates of @entity270 , he turns into a golfing @entity272			0
@entity255 has n’t finished outside the top 15 since turning 50 , a truly remarkable statistic			0
@entity275 ’s @entity274 finished on the same mark while @entity116 shot a respectable 72 — a score matched by the indefatigable @entity278 , now 56 — but for @entity46 ’s finest it was another frustrating day			2
shining light : the @entity280 struggled on day one , only @entity281 really impressing struggled : @entity282 ( left ) and @entity283 had a horrific day with the tricky tee positions @entity282 found insult added to injury when he was assessed a two - shot penalty at the ninth for touching the sand with his club in a bunker before he hit the ball to turn a poor 77 into a desperate 79 , while @entity283 and @entity293 shot 76s			1
it was a popular score among the @entity280 contingent with the two amateurs competing , @entity298 and @entity299 , on the same mark			0
in this company , last man out @entity281 ’s 73 was a positive beacon			1
course specialist @entity303 needs a low one as well on friday after also shooting 76			1
got a chance : @entity3 regulars @entity80 ( above ) and @entity79 are right in the mix what of the two @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310 , the first father and son to play in the same masters ? @entity309 , on his debut , shot a fine 70			1
his dad was surely delighted with that ? if he was , he kept it well hidden			0
did you watch @entity309 tee off , he was asked			0
‘ no , ’ came the reply			0
he did pretty well today ? ‘ i ’ve no idea what he shot			2
‘ did he ? good			0
’ @entity325 , it hardly needs saying , went round in 82			2
would n’t you think he ’d have swallowed his own disappointment ?			0

@entity27 leads the masters after a round of *67*
@entity4 , @entity79 and @entity80 a shot back
@entity52 on one under par , along with @entity281
@entity303 , @entity282 and @entity283 suffer
