by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 14:03 est , 15 october 2013 a super slim vet saved a sheepdog stuck in a rocky crevice after mountain rescuers were too big to reach him			1
slightly - built @entity5 , 35 , was brought in to wriggle down the tiny gap to reach the collie dog , @entity8 , stuck 82ft underground			1
@entity5 was the smallest volunteer in the desperate operation to rescue @entity11 who had been trapped in the crevice for two days			1
male rescuers got stuck when they tried to reach the dog unhurt : @entity8 was eventually brought up two days after he fell in the narrow gap			1
it took vet @entity5 , 34 , an hour to reach him it 's a long way down : @entity8 had been rounding up sheep when he slipped down the 80ft crevice and was only rescued when @entity5 ( pictured ) was lowered down by mountain rescue she said : ' they picked me after some of the men had a go and got stuck half way down			1
' luckily for @entity11 i was thin enough to squeeze my way along the gap to reach him			1
' the drama began when @entity8 fell down the crevice while rounding up sheep on a mountainside in @entity40 , @entity41			1
a mountain rescue team was called to search for the missing farm dog and heard him whimpering from inside the mountain			0
local vet @entity5 was called to treat the collie when he was brought to the surface			0
but after the male rescuers failed to reach him , they asked @entity5 to descended into the crevice attached to ropes			1
apprehensive : @entity5 ( pictured ) had never been potholing before rescuing @entity8			0
however , after other mountain rescue volunteers got stuck , she was the only one slim enough to wriggle down and get him stuck : @entity5 ( pictured ) was only going up the mountain to help the dog once it had been freed , but was ' roped ' in to the rescue as she was thinnest encouraging : @entity5 said she had n't expected to go into the crevice herself but the other mountain rescue volunteers talked her through it from above keen mountain walker @entity5 , of @entity62 , @entity41 , said : ' i did n’t expect to spend my afternoon in a narrow crevice			1
' i much prefer the wide open spaces of mountain sides and have never been potholing			0
' but all the time the team members were encouraging me and i felt totally safe			0
' if we had n’t have managed to find @entity11 he would have died			2
' a helmet camera attached to a mountain rescue volunteer captured the incredible two - hour rescue mission as it unfolded inside the impossibly tight mountain crag crevice			2
mountain rescue team member @entity74 said : ' the whole time inside the crevice @entity5 was at risk of becoming stuck herself			2
' she was incredibly brave and if it was n’t for her we may never have reached @entity11			2
' happy ending : @entity8 was brought up after being stuck for two days and was fed ' steak and sausages ' help : @entity5 was guided by the mountain rescue team			2
the vet from @entity62 , @entity41 , had never attempted a rescue like this before exhausting : keen mountain walker @entity5 was helped out of the tiny gap by mountain rescue volunteers @entity74 said the team knew it would be ' an interesting rescue ' when they heard whimpering coming from inside the deep mountain crevice			0
he said : ' the dog was found stuck in the bottom of a rock crevice that was 82ft deep , extremely narrow and halfway up a steep crag			1
' one team member was volunteered as being the skinniest build and lowered down into the slot			0
' but about half way down he became wedged and had to be pulled back up and out			0
' ' so we lowered @entity5 down and she spent an hour wriggling and worming her way down to him			1
' the dog seemed miraculously unhurt after he reached the surface			0
' we fed him sausages , steak and some dog food before he walked away with the team			0
' it ’s a shaggy dog story with a happy ending			0
' torchlight : @entity118 had fallen on the @entity120 mountainside by the time @entity5 had rescued @entity11 rescuers : the mountain rescue team are used to working on the @entity120 mountainside harness : @entity5 was aided from above by the volunteers - one of which captured the whole rescue on camera			0

@entity130 was lowered in to the gap after others got stuck
she spent an hour wriggling through the narrow space to reach sheepdog @entity11
the dog fell down the crevice while rounding up sheep and had been stuck for two days
