but it just made me feel like a black cloud floating around - i came off it and have since been seeking counselling			0
' i was given dates in september to see someone , but i never heard any confirmation			0
i need better help than medication but i still have n't seen anyone			0
' she added : ' these clinics do all they can but there just is n't the funding there to support everyone			0
sex abuse victims exist all over the country , not just in @entity2			2
' the victim 's plea follows the publication of the @entity63 which revealed at least 1,400 children were victims of sexual exploitation in the @entity67 town between 1997 and 2013			2

i just felt i was below everybody and not worthy of anything			0

" ' the only reason i 've kept myself together is because i 've got people backing me , including my family			1
without them i would have fallen to pieces a long time ago			0
' but there are other people out there going through this alone and they 're not getting the help they 're owed			0
' @entity11 's main abuser met her shortly after her 14th birthday and - despite being known to the police and social services - raped and attacked her until she was 16 , by which time she 'd ' lost count ' of how many times she was abused			1
despite her parents informing police within days of the abuse starting , officers said they could do nothing and have never made any arrests			2
