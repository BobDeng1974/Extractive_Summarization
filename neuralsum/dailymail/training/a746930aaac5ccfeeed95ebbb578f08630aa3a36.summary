he said : ‘ this is not @entity35			0
this is a 15 - year - old with her own vulnerabilities and a 30 - year - old teacher			0
‘ when parents send their children to school they quite properly expect those who teach their children to care for them properly			0

on the flight home , @entity4 sat next to her and held her hand , apparently to help calm her during turbulence			2
the incident sparked gossip among other pupils , and two teachers spoke to @entity4 to warn him to ‘ keep his distance ’			2

going inside : on the flight home @entity4 ( pictured arriving at @entity36 yesterday ) sat next to the schoolgirl and held her hand , apparently to help calm her during turbulence but when confronted again by teachers about their concerns , @entity4 became upset , and cried ‘ crocodile tears ’ , asking why these ‘ falsehoods ’ were being spoken about him , the court heard			1
he even telephoned the schoolgirl ’s mother , and in an ‘ utter lie ’ denied the allegations , despite the fact he was having ‘ clandestine meetings ’ with his pupil , the prosecutor said			2
after police were tipped off about the relationship in september , an officer and social workers went to the schoolgirl ’s home and spoke to her mother , who agreed to hand over her phone for analysis			0
when the schoolgirl heard what had happened , she immediately went to see @entity4 and the pair made plans to run away			2
mr @entity58 said : ‘ earlier in the year , when they were in the beginnings of their relationship , they had discussed running away together but only in general and rather fanciful terms , in a sort of forbidden love			0
‘ now it seemed a more realistic and tangible possibility			0
’ trial : @entity4 ( pictured yesterday upon his arrival at @entity36 in @entity175 ) , 30 , pursued the ' vulnerable ' pupil for months , a jury was told that night the schoolgirl secretly packed a bag of belongings and took it to school the following day			1

on the way to @entity192 she phoned a friend and said ‘ me and @entity194 are going north ’ in an attempt to put anyone off their trail			0
hearing : the fact that the schoolgirl was ' undoubtedly a willing participant ' in the alleged abduction was no defence , prosecutor @entity199 told @entity36 ( file picture ) in @entity175 minutes after boarding the ferry , @entity4 sent a final text to his wife saying : ‘ do n’t worry i ’ll call you tomorrow ’ , before getting rid of his phone			1
