a property in @entity2 so filthy neighbours named it ' @entity3 ' has been sold for £ 100,000 despite the council spending more than £ 30,000 cleaning it up before auction			1
the four - bedroom home in @entity7 , @entity8 , descended into squalor over ten years during which @entity8 pleaded with its residents - a couple jailed for committing fraud - to clear some of its clutter			1
once @entity16 and @entity17 were released from jail for plundering the estate of an elderly relative , officials implemented an enforcement action and began clearing the site , using a 40 - tonne crane to remove cars and boats from its grounds			1
the house in @entity7 , @entity8 , was so filthy neighbours nicknamed it the @entity3 after a sitcom about poverty and squalor the property descended into squalor when its residents were both jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud offences the council implemented two enforcement actions to the cost of around £ 30,000 including interest following complaints from other residents but despite spending £ 32,000 on tidying the grounds , there may not be any money left over from the sale of the property once other creditors are reimbursed			1
chief among them is @entity49 which has security over the property			2
' together with the sequestration fees i do n't think there will be very much to be realised towards the council and there are other avenues we could explore regarding the recovery of the debt , ' said a senior council official said			2
' the secure creditor is @entity49 who has the security over the property			0
my understanding is that security will swallow up most of the amount that was recovered from the sale			0
' @entity8 officials intervened when the @entity70 failed to clear the property after their 18 - month jail sentences in 2005			1
a 40 - tonne crane had to be brought to the property for officials to remove cars and boats that were rotting in its grounds @entity8 used more than 20 skips to clear some of the rubbish during two enforcement actions in 2007 and 2009 after the residents failed to clear up the clutter it is thought the couple handed over ownership of the house to their son , who was declared bankrupt earlier this year dirty clothes and towels hang in the cluttered garden at the home described by one councillor as the @entity3 for its filth bankruptcy officials sought permission to list the house for sale at auction , with an anonymous buyer offering £ 100,000 for the property last month 2005 : @entity16 and @entity17 are both jailed for 18 months after plundering estate of elderly relative 2007 : @entity8 imposes an enactment action to clear property costing around £ 16,000 2009 : a second action is taken to improve the state of the property , adding another £ 13,000 to council 's bill august 2014 : the property is listed with @entity110 after @entity112 bankruptcy officials receive permission from court to sell house september 2014 : the home is sold for £ 100,000			1
@entity8 officials remain hopeful they will see some of the money spent on the house returned through proceeds of the sale october 2014 : at a council meeting it is suggested that no funds will be reimbursed , with the security holder @entity125 first in line to receive cash from the sale the house has been known to local residents as the @entity3 since a councillor remarked it was similar to the squalor depicted in the television series , @entity135			1
the @entity137 programme , which began in 1962 , tells the story of a @entity140 man @entity139 ( played by @entity141 ) and his father , @entity142 ( played by @entity143 ) who run a rag'n'bone business in @entity145 and live in abject poverty			0
it ended in 1974 after four popular series			0
in 2007 , more than 20 skip - loads of rubbish were removed from the garden after it was described by a councillor as looking like a scene from the television programme @entity135			2
the effort cost more than £ 16,000 , with interest rates adding another £ 3,000 to the bill			0
a second clear - up was carried out in 2009 to the tune of a further £ 13,000			2
the couple then transferred the property to their son , who was declared bankrupt			0
in september it was listed by @entity110 , which said the property would require ' a degree of refurbishment prior to habitation			0
' despite selling for three times as much as what was spent by the local authority , the majority of proceeds from the sale will be used to settle unpaid tax and bank bills			1
@entity8 declined to comment when contacted by @entity178 .			0

angus council spent around £ 32,000 and nine years *attempting* to clear up the squalid property in @entity7
@entity3 *deteriorated* when residents @entity16 and @entity17 were both jailed for committing fraud
two enforcement actions were implemented to clear the site using cranes and more than 20 skips of rubbish
sale of property at auction is expected to *barely* settle debts with bank and creditors let alone council 's *expense*
