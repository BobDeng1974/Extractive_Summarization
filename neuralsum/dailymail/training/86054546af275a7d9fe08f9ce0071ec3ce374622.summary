in the line of fire : princess @entity2 campaigned vigorously for overseas development - but not necessarily on immigration the @entity5 , to which millions of her admirers donated money , has been hijacked by left - wingers to fund a pro-immigration propaganda campaign			1
directors of the charity set up a secretive project called @entity14 and then channelled hundreds of thousands of pounds into a string of associated organisations			1
the aim of the scheme is to alter @entity20 attitudes to immigration – which are currently in favour of far stricter border controls			1
among some of its most successful achievements , it lists the establishment of a new ‘ independent ’ think - tank – criticised by a @entity31 mp as a front for left - wing views on immigration			1
the migration observatory is advised by a senior journalist on the @entity38 newspaper , and the husband of its star columnist , @entity40			1
last night @entity42 , a close friend of @entity2 , described the decision as ‘ outrageous ’			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t ever recall @entity2 expressing any interest in this issue to me , and we spoke a great deal about her passions and concerns , particularly at the time that she was cutting down her charitable commitments			1
‘ she never wanted to be a figurehead or to be used overtly for lobbying purposes			2
to the extent that she remained involved in charitable work , it was of a purely practical nature , such as the removal of land mines , and the care of people with @entity61			2
‘ she was also always extremely careful never to get involved in anything that was remotely divisive along party political lines			2
’ the @entity64 was established within days of @entity2 ’s death in 1997 , in response to the unprecedented outpouring of public grief			1
its coffers were filled with £ 38million from the sale of the @entity72 record @entity71 ( @entity73 ) – which sold five million copies in the @entity20 alone			2
another £ 34million was raised from individual donations from a distressed public , community groups and companies			2
donations included individual 50p pieces sent by pensioners			2
later , a further £ 66million was raised through investments and commercial @entity82 , many of the grants from the @entity5 were paid to organisations closely associated with the princess , such as @entity87			1
but , in 2007 , its directors and trustees – who include a campaigner against the government ’s benefit cuts – dramatically changed direction			2
outrage : @entity2 's fund is said to have been hijacked to promote migration into the @entity20 since then , the @entity5 has spent a total of £ 7,195,575 on 91 grants , made to 79 different organisations working on behalf of immigrants and asylum seekers			1
one of the biggest beneficiaries of this new strategy was the @entity14 project , elements of which have received at least £ 820,0000			1
the @entity107 has been paid £ 350,000 over the last three years			2
it does not mention changing minds in its self - description or output , and there has been little public mention of the ‘ propaganda ’ project			1
according to strategy documents written by the @entity64 , @entity14 exists to address ‘ the plight of asylum seekers and their children in the @entity20 by seeking to track , inform and influence public attitudes towards migrants , refugees and asylum seekers ’			2
not what she would have wanted : a close friend of the @entity127 ( left , sitting at the @entity128 in @entity129 , has blasted the latest revelations but last year , a conference of the @entity132 said the work was designed to achieve ‘ attitudinal change ’ on ‘ negative attitudes ’ to all migrants			1
it described changing attitudes towards migrants as an ‘ example of the sort of “ wicked ” social problem that foundations are increasingly likely to encounter ’			2
opinion polls in @entity20 have repeatedly shown the public ’s desire for a sharp reduction in net migration			2
this has infuriated the left - wing establishment , which is a long - standing champion of large - scale economic migration			0
the @entity64 supports @entity14 in tandem with a string of other charities and pro-immigration organisations			1
they include the @entity158 – itself a recipient of a £ 40,000 grant from the @entity64 so it could help fund @entity14 – and a @entity163 - based group named @entity164			0
@entity164 , which has given the @entity107 £ 342,000 , says it wants to ensure migrants ‘ can ultimately thrive in a society that is comfortable with the diversity and opportunity that immigration brings ’			0
it is ploughing huge sums into pro-immigration groups – including the @entity172 ’ @entity173 , the new @entity175 think - tank and the observatory			1
@entity31 mp @entity177 says the @entity107 , part of the @entity180 think - tank at @entity181 , has been set up ‘ to try to undermine ’ @entity182 , a campaign group for stricter immigration controls			1
he said it was ‘ trying to use the status of @entity181 to peddle left - wing views on immigration ’ , adding : ‘ people who gave money to the @entity64 would be very surprised to learn it has donated huge sums to a propaganda effort to change public opinion on immigration			0
’ the observatory ’s media advisory board includes @entity197 , a writer on the @entity38 , and @entity199			0
it is chaired by mr @entity199 , a former communications director at the @entity202 and @entity38 journalist , who is married to @entity40 – the paper ’s leading columnist and a vocal critic of the @entity206			0
pro-immigration : there is the feeling that @entity2 's work abroad have been blown into a falsehood that she wholeheartedly supported migration on the day of the wedding of prince @entity214 to @entity215 , miss @entity40 described the event as @entity20 ’s ‘ @entity218 moment ’			1
of the day itself , she asked : ‘ is this what @entity20 is and who we are ? here was a grand illusion , the old conspiracy to misrepresent us to ourselves			0
’ other groups involved in the @entity14 project include the pro-immigration @entity228 , and the @entity172 ’ @entity173			1
both @entity228 , an advocate of the benefits of economic migration , and @entity232 get money from the @entity158			0
the directors of the @entity5 , until it was wound up at the end of last year , were headed by @entity236 , @entity2 ’s eldest sister			1
something fishy going on ? the observatory 's media board is chaired by @entity38 journalist @entity199 the others were @entity241 , the former chairman of the gay rights campaign group @entity243 , and @entity245			0
mr @entity241 is also a trustee of @entity175 , another major player in @entity14 and which itself received £ 470,000 from the @entity64			0
miss @entity245 publicly signed a petition for @entity248 to live on £ 53 a week , as demanded by a protester against benefit cuts			0
sir @entity251 , former chief executive at @entity252 ’s , stockbroker @entity253 , dr @entity255 , described as a leading voluntary sector researcher , and @entity257 , who has worked within the charity sector for 20 years , were the other directors			0
the different groups it has been supporting are intrinsically linked			0
@entity263 , a key figure in the @entity232 , sits on the @entity107 ’s expert advisory board			0
the @entity64 was wound up at the end of 2012 and passed to the charitable foundation set up for the @entity268 and @entity215 and prince @entity269			0
a @entity271 spokesman said the foundation had not played any part in the controversial grant - giving			0
he made clear any residual income received for the @entity5 will go to the foundation – which will not continue the @entity5 ’s grant - making in any way			0
a spokesman for the @entity107 said : ‘ the migration observatory was designed to provide accurate data and information to all contributors to the migration debate			0
our work has been used and cited as a reliable source by politicians and newspapers across the political spectrum , including in multiple stories in the @entity290			0
this is a testament to our success in providing data and evidence that are useful , accurate , and non-partisan			0
’ sir @entity251 said of @entity177 ’s comments : ‘ i am surprised to hear that			1
it is not my understanding of what the @entity107 is all about			0

secret project saw hundreds of thousands of pounds towards pro-immigration campaigns
close friend of the late @entity2 describes it as ' outrageous '
@entity31 mp @entity177 says organisations ' undermine @entity182 '
