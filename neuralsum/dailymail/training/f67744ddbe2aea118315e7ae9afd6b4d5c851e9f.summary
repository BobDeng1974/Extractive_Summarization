the body of @entity25 , who was 18 when he disappeared , was found on november 10 , 1974 , in the carport area of a condominium complex near @entity28 , police said			1
twelve days later , @entity9 officials at @entity13 some 50 miles to the south declared him a deserter			2
police looking into cold cases with a grant from the @entity36 came to suspect the body may be a member of the military because of the man 's tattoos and haircut			1
@entity25 reportedly had a @entity9 tattoo on his shoulder , but it 's unclear how investigators could not make the connection sooner			1

relatives told investigators that @entity25 , who they knew as ' @entity56 , ' never would have voluntarily deserted			0
mystery : @entity3 vanished from @entity13 in @entity8 and had been branded a deserter by the @entity9 marked : @entity25 had a @entity9 tattoo on his shoulder when he was found dead at a carport in this apartment complex , but cops failed to make the connection ' my parents both went to their graves not knowing what had happened to him and knowing they listed him as a deserter , ' @entity25 of @entity64 , the victim 's older brother and one of his few surviving relatives , told the @entity73			1
