photographer @entity0 has pictured unique tribes in remote locations around the world but when he first tried to seek out the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , he could n't find a driver willing to take him			1
then when he tried to meet them at a camel market in the @entity10 he was warned by @entity12 workers : ' do not try to meet them , do not talk to them , they are crazy ! ' @entity0 told @entity13 : ' when i first planned to visit the @entity4 , i could n't find a driver who was willing to take me to their villages in the nearby desert			1
they regard them as dangerous " gypsies "			0
" they will rob you and then try to steal my taxi , " they all told me			0
simple life : the @entity29 people live in tents in the desert despite having vast sums of money acquired through selling camels travellers : the nomadic tribe came to @entity5 from @entity37 about 200 years ago fearsome reputation : some members of the tribe have been known to be involved in human trafficking and torture striking look : the women wear a veil which covers their nose ( a very sexual facial feature in their culture ) and their mouth , but not all of their hair young bride : a woman must be married by the age of 16 or she is considered too old to be a wife @entity55 : daughters are desired over sons because their mother will be paid thousands when she marries			1
marriages can be arranged when girls are as young as six ' after tough negotiations , one driver finally agreed to drive me to the @entity4 , but he dropped me off 200 meters from the camp			1
' so why have the @entity4 , who have led a nomadic lifestyle in the barren and hostile desert for centuries , built up such a fearsome reputation ? the @entity4 originally came from @entity37 but can now be found in areas including @entity71 , @entity72 and the @entity73			1
they move from place to place in search of grass for their camels - which helps them make a fortune as they can sell their prized animals to wealthy sheikhs for as much as £ 16,000 each			2
despite their wealth , they live in tents with no electricity and no running water - although some do embrace modern technology in the form of cars and mobile phones			1
when @entity0 eventually meets the @entity4 , he is told by @entity93 , the chief of the @entity4 village in @entity5 , of their business selling camels : ' yes it is a lot of money , but you know we have big families to take care of ! we work a lot , trading with @entity105 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity37 ... ' mobile business : the @entity29 travel from place to place seeking grass for their prized camels lucrative creatures : their camels can be sold for £ 16,000 each wary : the @entity4 can frequently be found at camel markets - although not everyone is brave enough to approach them traditional : the tribe earn a fortune from their camels but still live primitive lifestyles the chief revealed that they shun much of modern technology , including tv because ' the television shows sickness and disasters			1
instead of buying sickness with your money , it is better to live happily , peacefully , and freely			0
' however , as the people 's fearsome reputation suggests , not all members of the @entity4 live as peacefully as @entity93 suggests			2
a @entity134 report explains that they are the master smugglers of everything from guns to people , getting involved in hostage taking and human trafficking			0
@entity0 explains : ' @entity4 also make their money from a less legitimate business			1
in the refugee camps around @entity145 in @entity73 , @entity5 people attempting to move on are kidnapped by the @entity4			0
once they kidnap an @entity5 , the victim will have to ask their relatives to wire ransom money to one of the kidnapper ’s accounts around the world			0
if there is any delay in transferring the money , the victim will be physically abused			0
testimonies say the more the money transfer is delayed , the more the victim is tortured			0
' one reason the @entity4 need money is to marry			2
the groom must pay up to £ 40,000 to the bride - to - be 's mother for her hand in marriage			0
such marriages can be arranged when a girl is as young as six			2
if a woman is not married by the time she is 16 , it 's considered too late for her to become a wife			2
beliefs : the people abide to @entity37 @entity177 law segrated : @entity4 live in isolated communities , preferring not to live with people of other tribes the men ' look @entity182 and wear loose white clothing '			1
their simple appearance belies their wealth many of the tribe shun modern technology as they prefer to ' live happily , peacefully , and freely ' different sides : while those pictured are peaceful , others are master smugglers of everything from guns to people @entity93 explained to @entity0 that daughters are desired over sons because of the riches they can bring via marriage			1
if added : ' if a man wants to get married but is n’t rich enough to afford the wife , then the @entity4 from @entity72 , @entity73 , and @entity37 contribute so the groom can afford his bride			1
' @entity0 saw no evidence of the @entity4 's wealth or violent pastimes when he was invited to join @entity93 to drink tea under his tent , when he eventually tracked down one of the tribes in @entity5			1
he learnt that the @entity4 stay in isolated communities , preferring not to live with people of other tribes			2
but says @entity93 : ' when we travel , we will be welcomed everywhere by other @entity4			0
' some @entity4 have moved out of the desert to live in towns such as @entity145 in @entity73 so their children can go to school			2
but one ten - year - old boy told @entity0 that he prefers living in the desert despite the harsh conditions			0
describing the enigmatic @entity4 people he met during his stay , @entity0 said : ' @entity4 men have no special appearance : they look @entity182 and wear loose white clothing			1
on the other hand , the women are very striking			0
they all wear colourful traditional dresses and a veil which covers their nose ( a very sexual facial feature in their culture ) and their mouth , but not their hair			0
' this is rather unusual in the @entity239 culture			0
with long hair , some of them have an amazing style with long black locks jutting out in all directions			0
' however , since the @entity4 follow @entity37 @entity177 law , and more and more have enough money to make the @entity248 to @entity249 , they come back with new precepts from @entity37 , asking their women to cover the hair			1
