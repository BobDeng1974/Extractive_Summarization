@entity0 have spoken to @entity1 about central midfielder @entity2 as the ailing club try to beef up their squad before the transfer window closes on monday			1
manager @entity6 needs reinforcements after a desperate start to the season that has seen his team take just a point from two @entity13 games and crash out of the @entity15 4 - 0 at @entity16			0
the @entity17 is keen on a deal for @entity19 and @entity21 midfielder @entity20 , but @entity0 are also in contact with @entity1 about @entity2 after the @entity24 club dropped their asking price to £ 23.8million			1
he is also aware he has competition for @entity2 from @entity37 , who can offer the @entity40 star @entity42 football			2
however , @entity43 has made his needs clear in recent days and @entity31 has permission from owners the @entity47 to spend big once again after the @entity49 record £ 60m paid by @entity0 to @entity50 for @entity51 this week			2
@entity0 only concluded a deal with @entity1 for defender @entity53 last week and have concerns about getting involved again after the protracted nature of that deal			1
wanted : @entity0 have also been interested in @entity19 ' @entity20 ( centre ) and could yet launch a bid equally , though , they have concerns over @entity20 ’s knee after it needed surgery last season and they at least know their good relationship with @entity24 agent @entity65 could help them get a deal done for 22 - year - old @entity2			1
meanwhile , @entity0 have interest in @entity68 and @entity69 from ‘ five or six ’ clubs and either could leave before monday			2
@entity69 , understandably , would prefer to go to a club at the top end of the league while @entity68 may choose to run his contract down			0
@entity0 also have offers for @entity77 playmaker @entity76 but perhaps unsurprisingly are struggling to move on @entity80 failure @entity78			0
the club will officially unveil @entity82 on thursday and he will go straight into the team for saturday ’s game at @entity85			0
raring to go : @entity51 will be in @entity0 ' squad when they travel to face @entity85 on saturday @entity87 joins @entity90 's @entity89 exodus			0

@entity0 have held talks with @entity1 about @entity2
@entity24 club have dropped asking price to £ 23.8million
@entity0 also remain interested in @entity19 midfielder @entity20
it is unlikely that the @entity101 club will sign both players
