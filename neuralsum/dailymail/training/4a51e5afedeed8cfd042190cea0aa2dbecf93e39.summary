a beauty blogger who has not washed her hair with shampoo for two years is claiming her hair is healthier than ever			2
@entity4 , 32 , ditched shampoo in the bid to get thicker , fuller and more lustrous locks after recoiling at the amount of chemicals she was lathering on to her head			1
@entity4 went cold turkey using the ‘ no - poo ’ method , which involves using only water or natural substitutes instead of shampoo			1
@entity4 chose to ditch shampoo on the first day of a job in the charity sector , and confesses her biggest worry was that , ‘ i wanted my hair to look good ’			2
she told the @entity27 : ‘ i have always wondered whether the urban legend that if you leave your hair long enough it will start to wash itself was true or not			0
and when i became a mother i felt i should start looking more at what i was putting on and in my own and my children ’s bodies			0
’ healthy hair : @entity4 uses the ' no - poo ' method , which involves using only water or natural substitutes instead of shampoo despite not using shampoo for two years @entity4 has managed to create ambitious styles with her hair the rationale behind the ‘ no - poo ’ method is that shampoo strips the hair of its natural oils , which prompts the scalp to generate more oils to replace them			1
this leaves the scalp greasy as it is overloaded with oil , which prompts us to then use shampoo			0
by not using shampoo , ‘ no - poo ’ advocates claim it returns to its natural balance , keeping the hair clean by itself			1
@entity4 says in her book @entity59 that the hair should be healthier and stronger as it is less damaged than shampooed hair			1
negatives : @entity4 says using shampoo strips the hair of its natural oils , which prompts the scalp to generate more oils to replace them however until luscious locks are achieved there is what @entity4 calls ‘ the tricky transition period ’ in which the scalp continues to over-produce oils and she does admit there was a ‘ smelly stage ’			1
but she kept working at it , with the use of head - scarfs and natural remedies , and now says she has glowing auburn hair			2
although she does admit she has been tempted to use shampoo : ‘ once we were painting my house and i got paint in my hair and told my husband i was going upstairs to use his shampoo			0
he talked me down , because he knew i ’d be disappointed afterwards if i did it			0
in the end i was able to just brush it out with a bristle brush			0

@entity4 , 32 , was *unhappy* with putting chemicals on her head
she used the ' no poo ' method , using only water or natural substitutes
advocates claim hair returns to its natural balance and keeps itself clean
