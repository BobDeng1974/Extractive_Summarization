the @entity0 believes that a cyberattack earlier this year affected 56 million unique payment cards as part of the largest retail security breach in history			1
the @entity7 - based home retailer , which has more than 2,000 stores nationwide , says it has now eliminated the malware behind the attacks that took place between april and september			1
it said it has also completed a ' major ' payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of customers ' payment data in its @entity17 stores			1
according to the @entity39 , one of the only ways customers can see if you have been hit by the hack is by checking bank statements for irregularities			0
you can also initiate a credit freeze - also known as a security freeze - which limits the access you have to credit reports , meaning hackers have less of an opportunity to open accounts in your name			1
in response to the breach , @entity0 is offering a year 's coverage through identity theft protection programs - @entity54 and @entity55 it says that service is free			1
in order to protect yourself in the future , experts have suggested signing up to annualcreditreport.com			0
the service allows individuals to check if there has been any fraudulent activity on the account on a yearly basis			0
there are also more simple methods such as using different passwords for different accounts and primarily using credit cards for transactions - because they have better identity protection			0
@entity0 is believed to have been hit by the same malicious software program that stole card account data from cash registers at @entity25			1
retailers , banks and card companies have responded to the breaches by speeding the adoption of microchips in @entity17 credit and debit cards - a technology that helps makes transactions more secure			0
the @entity17 is one of the only countries in the world to still use magnetic strips - one of the least safe ways of making a transaction - ahead of chip - based methods of payment			2
according to @entity96 , the hack focused on the self - service lanes at the stores			1
a source close to the investigation told the site that an analysis revealed some of @entity0 's store registers had been infected with a new variant of ' @entity106 ' - also known as ' @entity107 '			2
it is a strain of malware designed to siphon data from cards when they are swiped at infected point - of - sale systems running @entity113			2
to try and combat this , @entity0 has announced that it plans to have chip - enabled checkout terminals at all of its @entity17 stores by the end of this year			0
the store has also confirmed its sales - growth estimates for the fiscal year and expects to earn $ 4.54 per share in fiscal 2014 , up 2 cents from its prior guidance			2
@entity0 ceo @entity123 said in a statement : ' we apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused , and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges			0
' from the time this investigation began , our guiding principle has been to put our customers first , and we will continue to do so			0
