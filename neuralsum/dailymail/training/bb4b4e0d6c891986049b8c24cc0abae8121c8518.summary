it was a snowscape more glittering , brilliant and stirring than i have ever seen			0
‘ snow ball fights carry on			0
in the south of the camp , tobogganing is taking place with much yodeling with primitive sleds or benches or tables			1
the snow balling has so far cost us a number of window panes			0

@entity7 wrote : ‘ on christmas day evening , we dined once more to excess – lobster in mayonnaise , spinach and scrambled egg , bread , cheese , and dripping and a cup of coffee			0
then presentation of gifts to the orderlies			1
’ regular food parcels from home also kept the prisoners supplied with chocolate cake , cocoa , honey , sweets , stock cubes , sugar and flour to supplement their generous prisoner rations			1
the officers even had their own camp bakery and vegetable plots on site			1

the @entity169 was posted there early in @entity171 before it became a pow camp			2

’ when the first @entity4 prisoners arrived in january 1917 ‘ they were virtually starving , ’ he said			2
‘ there were two distinct types of officer			2
there were those who were very eager to find out how the war was going			0
but there was another group , including artists and musicians , who were glad to be out of the fray			0
’ a @entity200 report in 1917 stated ‘ a certain chivalrous attitude is maintained between the @entity203 officers and the prisoners ’ and named it as the ‘ best camp ’ for officer pows in the country			1
