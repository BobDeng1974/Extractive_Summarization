the consumer version of the much anticipated @entity2 virtual reality headset is just months away - and experts have started to speculate on what it could look like			1
@entity6 purchased the company earlier this year in a $ 2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) deal			1
however , one expert says its success could depend on its design - and has created his own			2
ceo @entity22 told the audience at web summit 2014 in @entity25 earlier this year , that a consumer - version of the company 's @entity28 headset is ' close '			1
@entity30 has been using the latest version of the headset , the $ 350 ( £ 215 ) @entity34 version aimed at developers wanting to write @entity28 apps			1
at first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky , although it is surprisingly light when attached via straps			1
however , once you are immersed in a virtual world , doubts were quickly forgotten			2
the technology , still just a developer 's version , is breathtakingly good			2
while the resolution still does n't give the feeling of quite being in the real world , it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world			2
the number of demos and games is already growing by the day , and feature everything from virtual rollercoaster rides to being lost in space , all made more immersive with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as your head moves			2
it 's not quite ready for primetime yet , but is almost there - and the @entity2 headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality			1
@entity69 says he was inspired by the project - but not its design			2
however , @entity69 believes the firm still has a major task ahead - making it look attractive			2
' from a functionality standpoint , the @entity2 is spectacular , he said			2
' i had the opportunity to visit their headquarters this past summer and was swept away by my incredible experience there			0
virtual reality is our future			0
but in order for widespread adoption they 've got to overcome one last obstacle			0
' @entity88 says the technology must be made to look attractive			0
' as great as the @entity2 might be , how are we going to start sitting around with big black boxes strapped to our faces ? picture walking into a room , only to see your friends and family sitting around with boxes on their faces			0
i do n't see that being a common scene anytime soon			0
' ' ultimately i settled for a clean , sleek look , ' he explains on his web site			0
' the headset resembles ski goggles , a familiar object , finished with a reflective front			1
' to a passerby , you 'd appear to be wearing the world 's fanciest goggles on your face			0
currently @entity115 only sells its headset to developers			1
ceo @entity22 told the audience at web summit 2014 in @entity25 earlier this year , that a consumer - version of the company 's @entity28 headset is ' close '			1
he admitted the latest prototype , codenamed @entity124 , is ' largely finalized for a consumer product			1
' ' we 're all hungry for it to happen , ' he told the audience			0
' we 're getting very close			0
it 's months , not years away , but many months			0
' he also revealed one area holding back the product was the lack of a controller			0
he said keyboards , mice and gamepads are n't up to the job and neither is gesture - control			0
' you want to feel it when you touch a button , ' he said			0
@entity115 acquired @entity143 , the designers of the xbox 360 controller in march			0
@entity22 also revealed that although the technology is currently similar to ski goggles , future versions will look like sunglasses			0
@entity22 also revealed the company has changed significantly since it was acquired by @entity6 in march			0
the current design : the @entity124 virtual reality headset ( pictured ) was unveiled at the @entity154 conference in @entity155			1
it is lighter than its predecessor and features 360 - degree tracking , but @entity28 is yet to release the full list of specifications for the device			1
operating as an independent subsidiary , @entity115 has grown from 75 people to over 200 employees and now operates a separate r&d division			1
asked about the threat of rival @entity28 products , @entity22 said his main concern is shoddy implementation			1
in recent months dozens of firms have revealed low cost headsets using a movbile phone as the display			0
' we 're a little worried about bigger companies putting out products that are n't ready			0
' disorientation and motion sickness is the elephant in the room			0
' we 're encouraging big companies not to put out a product before it 's ready			0
' we want to get it right , we do n't want it to be four or five years			0
we 're eager for this to happen			0
' @entity69 's ' ski goggle ' design is far sleeker earlier this year the @entity6 - owned firm has unveiled its @entity124 model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor , and now features 360 - degree tracking			1
reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $ 200 ( £ 122 )			1
@entity22 says it is too early to say what the ' killer app ' is - but said it could even be face to face talking			0
' one that resonates with us internally is that this will have a big aspect of gaming , where you feel like you 're in the game or movie			0
' but when we can have face to face conversations , that 's a big @entity211 in the future you can throw in a pair on sunglasses and have the same conversation we are having , that 's really transformative			0
' the 360 - degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer 's head movements , which in turn will make games more immersive and true - to - life			1
elsewhere , the headset has a higher resolution , per eye , than the current second - generation development kit – @entity34 - and these displays are powered by @entity230 devices			2
@entity69 even design the headset 's internals , showing how each part fits together the headset resembles ski goggles , a familiar object , finished with a reflective front			2
a teardown of the @entity34 revealed that the headset uses @entity241 displays , and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship @entity245			1
by comparison , the @entity34 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye , and the note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution			2
aside from these specifications , @entity28 is yet to release the rest of @entity124 's features			1
' there are plenty of technical challenges left to solve for the consumer @entity2 , but @entity124 is truly the best virtual reality headset we 've ever built , ' said mr @entity22			1
the price of the @entity2 consumer model , which does not have a release date yet , was revealed by @entity28 co-founder @entity266			1
speaking with @entity267 , mr @entity266 said the price could go up to $ 400 ( £ 240 ) , but that the price range was an estimate			1
he also cautioned that nothing is set in stone			0
' that could slide in either direction depending on scale , pre-orders , the components we end up using , [ or ] business negotiations , ' he said			0
previously , @entity28 said it was aiming to launch the consumer model for around $ 300 ( £ 185 )			1
developers can currently buy protoype versions of the headset for $ 350 ( £ 215 )			1
the firm also revealed earlier this month it has been working with @entity230 on a mobile version of the headset , which will go on sale this year , but will not feature the advanced head tracking or high resolution display the @entity115 version is expected to have			1
@entity6 purchased the company earlier this year when its $ 2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) deal to buy @entity28 headset firm @entity115 was approved			1
it will first be used for immersive games , but @entity6 ceo @entity295 promised the headset will ' change the way we work , play and communicate ' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted @entity295			2
a commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015			2
