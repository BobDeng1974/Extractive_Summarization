wearing matching slippers and bow ties , @entity9 , 50 , @entity3 's consul - general in @entity8 , married his 33 - year - old @entity13 boyfriend @entity12 on the lawn of the home of ambassador sir @entity16			2
new rules mean that @entity3 nationals in homosexual relationships can marry in @entity3 consulates in 24 countries around the world as the land where the building stands is technically @entity3 soil			2
' that country is clearly sick			0
it 's like the last days of @entity42 , ' one person wrote in an online comment			0

but it 's not @entity6 culture			1
please respect that , ' wrote another			0
a third suggested that same - sex unions threaten family ethics and destabilise society			1

mr @entity9 boasts about his good news on @entity35 , a @entity6 equivalent of @entity36 , followed by good wishes from ambassador @entity16 - ' @entity59 and marry on ! ' @entity9 hails from @entity60 and has worked as consul - general in @entity8 since january 2011			2
