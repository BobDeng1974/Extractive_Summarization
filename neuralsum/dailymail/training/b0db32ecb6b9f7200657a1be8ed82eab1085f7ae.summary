by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 10:21 est , 16 may 2012 a baby girl has made waves when she was born in a water birth - weighing an astonishing 12lb 6oz			1
@entity5 @entity4 , who arrived in a birthing pool at @entity7 , is @entity8 ’s third biggest baby girl born naturally			1
remarkably her mother @entity9 gave birth only with gas and air			2
mrs @entity4 , 33 , and husband @entity13 , 32 , had no idea that their daughter would be so huge			2
our big baby girl : @entity5 @entity4 surprised her parents @entity9 and @entity13 by weighing 4lb more than her siblings did at birth their other children @entity23 , eight , and @entity24 , five , weighed in at 8lb 10oz and 8lb 9oz respectively , and the couple expected @entity5 to be a similar size			1
the average baby girl is almost half the size at 7lb 4oz			1
her grandfather @entity29 , 54 , has nicknamed her @entity30 because she has rolls of fat around her arms			1
@entity9 , an optical assistant from @entity34 , said : ' it was n’t until she was born that we realised she was so big			2
they put her on the scales and everyone was shocked			2
i was struggling and i was a bit out of it towards the end of the labour but we still managed to have a natural water birth			2
' it was perfectly fine and the labour was no more painful than the two other births			2
' @entity5 was born a fortnight overdue at midnight on may 11 - after a three - and - a - half hour labour			0
@entity8 's third biggest girl : @entity5 was a fortnight overdue when she was born @entity9 and @entity13 , a construction site manager , were able to take her home after two days in hospital and praised staff for their care			0
@entity55 , midwife at @entity56 which runs the hospital , said : ' it was an absolute delight to support @entity9 throughout her water birth			0
' we were all surprised when baby @entity5 arrived with a huge splash weighing 12lb 6oz , a first for the birth centre , ' said @entity55			1
the national record for the biggest naturally born baby girl is held by @entity66 , from @entity67 , who was born weighing 12lb 12oz in february			1
most big babies are born by caesarean , including @entity8 ’s biggest baby girl @entity70 - weighing 14lbs 4oz in february			1
the heaviest baby ever born was in january 1979 when @entity72 gave birth in @entity74 to a boy that weighed 23lb 12ozs but he died 11 hours later			1
the world ’s heaviest surviving baby was another boy , born weighing 22lb 8oz in @entity79 in 1955			1
in the post-war years there has been a steady upward trend in birth weight , explained in the main by improvements in our diet			0
larger , healthier , more muscular babies were born as a result , pushing the current average birth weight to 7lb 8oz for boys and 7lb 4oz for girls — up 2oz and 1½oz respectively since 1970			0
and this rise in birth weight shows no sign of stopping			0
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of babies born tipping the scales at above 9lb 15oz increased by 20 per cent and experts expect statistics from the next decade — 2003 to 2013 — to have rocketed yet again			0
while there is no set figure for how much a newborn should weigh , the @entity100 use 8lb 13oz as its guideline for the tipping point between a healthy weight and a potentially problematic one			0
alarmingly , the rate of macrosomia ( the medical term for babies born over this tipping point ) has soared in recent years			0
so why is this happening ? the simplest answer is that babies are getting bigger because their mums are , too			0
the latest figures show that almost half of women of child - bearing age in @entity8 are overweight or obese			0
obese women make more insulin than other mothers - to - be , which leads to more fat , sugars and other foods being supplied to the baby			1
obesity during pregnancy can be dangerous for mother and child — it increases the risk of many complications , including stillbirth			0
doctors report that bigger babies are at a high risk of shoulder dystocia — where the shoulder gets stuck during the delivery			0
it is a potentially life - threatening condition , which can compress the umbilical cord or put pressure on the baby ’s neck , leaving it dangerously starved of oxygen			1
in extreme cases , it is necessary for the obstetrician to break the baby ’s collarbone , in order to deliver it alive , which runs a high risk of nerve damage			1
‘ while most people think the bigger the baby , the healthier it is , there is mounting evidence to suggest the opposite : in fact , babies carrying too much weight at birth will live with the consequences for the rest of their lives , ’ says dr @entity154 , a consultant obstetrician and spokeswoman for the @entity156			1
‘ they are more prone to diabetes and heart disease and are affected at a younger age			0
’ to combat such problems , earlier this year , the @entity174 announced a trial to put obese mothers - to - be on diabetes medication to reduce the amount of insulin in their bloodstream — thus controlling the baby ’s weight gain .			2
