by @entity0 powering down a runway in an aeroplane could be a thing of the past - for the rich and famous at least - if this concept for a personal aircraft takes off			1
a team of engineers who specialise in the design of wind - energy turbines have designed a small electric aeroplane that can take off vertically			2
its lift off would be similar to a helicopter ’s , but once airborne , the @entity13 aircraft ’s 12 rotor blade motors fold up so it can glide along like a conventional plane			1
blades : 12 helicopter - style rotor blades will provide vertical lift and then swivel and fold up so the aircraft can fly as a plane			1
batteries : the next generation of lithium polymer batteries will supply the power for the vehicle and are said to be more efficient than using conventional fuel			0
sensors : @entity40 developed for consumer electronics like smartphones provide sensing capabilities once reserved for rockets all on a circuit board the size of a postage stamp			0
@entity48 has not yet built a full scale prototype of the @entity13 , but around 24 10lb ( 4.5kg ) models exist to prove the design works			1
the models have piqued the interest of @entity54 , which is now funding the development of a 55lb ( 25kg ) version			0
@entity57 , the firm behind the design , which is based in @entity59 , @entity60 , has produced supercomputer simulations of a 1,700lb ( 770kg ) full - scale @entity13 aircraft and claim it should be able to fly two people between @entity64 and @entity65 – a 200mile ( 322km ) journey – in just one hour			1
soaring through the skies : it 's take off might be similar to a helicopter 's , but once airborne , the @entity13 aircraft 's 12 propellers fold up so it can glide like an aeroplane ( illustrated in this computer simulation ) distinctive : the @entity13 's most striking feature is its retractable arms that reposition the motors from a horizontal position like a helicopter ( pictured ) to take off vertically , to folding up for aerodynamic flight such a trip would require 50kilowatt - hours of electricity , which would make it around five times more efficient that a personal aeroplane burning approximately one - and - a - half gallons of fuel			1
mr @entity48 told @entity88 that the plane would not have been possible a decade ago , but compact and efficient motors , increasingly power dense batteries , smart control systems and ever tinier sensors mean that the @entity13 could soon take to the skies			1
its most noticeable feature is retractable arms that reposition the motors from a horizontal position - like a helicopter to take off vertically - to folding up for aerodynamic flight			2
computers can adjust the speed of the motors 4,000 times per second to optimise efficiency , reduce noise and improve flight control , according to the firm			0
the models demonstrate that 12 compact electric motors work three times as efficiently as combustion engines on personal airplanes , which could make the @entity13 a safer way for the rich and famous to travel in the future , the company said			1
efficient : @entity57 , which is based in @entity59 , @entity60 , has produced supercomputer simulations of a 1,700lb full - scale @entity13 aircraft ( pictured ) and claim it should be able to fly two people between @entity64 and @entity65 - a 200 mile journey - in just one hour safer ? models of the aircraft have demonstrated that its 12 compact electric motors work three times as efficiently as combustion engines on personal airplanes , which could make the @entity13 a safer way for the rich and famous to travel in the future while the @entity13 is currently a number of models , @entity131 has developed the world ’s first short take - off and vertical landing ( @entity138 ) system capable of powering a supersonic aircraft - the @entity140			1
it is the successor of the famous harrier jet and its @entity143 is so powerful it could lift 17 @entity145 cars			0
they system claims to make operations safer for pilots , enabling the plane to hover like a helicopter and take off vertically			2
the fighter jet is the third @entity138 aircraft to go into production , but unlike the proposed @entity13 , it needs a very short run - up on a runway to take off before it can hover			2
the @entity143 is a dramatic improvement on the previous one as it has twice the capability of a harrier jet , while being able to travel faster and further			0
replacing the ageing fleet of @entity160 and the now - retired @entity161 , the @entity140 will give the @entity162 an all weather aircraft with day and night capability , which is able to operate from air bases or the @entity166			0
the innovation has been shortlisted for the @entity169 ’s @entity168 - the @entity171 ’s longest running national prize for engineering			0
the first @entity140 equipped with the @entity143 was delivered in january 2012 and the fleet has now grown to 42			0
high flier : @entity131 has developed the world 's first short take - off and vertical landing ( @entity138 ) system capable of powering a supersonic aircraft - the @entity140 ( pictured )			0

the @entity13 takes off like a helicopter , but once airborne its 12 propellers rotate and fold up so it can glide like an aeroplane
@entity57 , based in @entity59 , @entity60 , has produced supercomputer simulations of a 1,700lb full - scale @entity13 aircraft plus models
company claims the electric plane could be five times as efficient as a conventional personal aeroplane and safer too
there is no hint as to when a full - size version of the @entity13 will take flight
