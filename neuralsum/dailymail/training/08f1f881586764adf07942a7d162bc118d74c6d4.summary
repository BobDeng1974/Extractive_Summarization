believe the hype and they ’re the natural solution for everything from cancer , heart disease and dementia to ageing skin , poor eyesight and insomnia			2
no wonder ‘ superfruits ’ pop up in cereals , desserts , snack bars , juice , face cream — even designer gin			1
but though it is claimed that goji berries , acai juice , pomegranates and cranberries are rooted in ancient medicine , the explosion in their use is , in fact , a modern phenomenon			1
@entity28 : ' superfruit ' cranberry is often coated in sugar to be made palatable and it is also added to cranberry juice two out of three juices launched last year claimed to contain superfruit			1
a major launch in 2011 was @entity36 — a fruit juice made in part from an imported @entity40 cherry supposedly very high in antioxidants			1
one glass will give ‘ the equivalent health benefits of around 20 portions of fruit and vegetables ’			1
though the company offers no proof of that claim , @entity36 has been a hit , with all supermarkets and health stores stocking it			0
but anti-obesity campaigners point out it has as much sugar as cola — about 5 tsp in a 250ml serving			1
@entity58 has 9 tsp sugar			1
despite doubts around the science , superfruits and their spin - offs keep coming			1
last year saw the launch of a ‘ supertree ’ — the powder of the bark of the @entity69 baobab , which you mix into yoghurt or water to get ‘ six times more vitamin c than oranges ’			1
meanwhile , @entity75 is busy pushing yuzu lemonade , from a @entity78 citrus fruit that has ‘ three times as much vitamin c as lemons ’			1
some kind of super : pomegranate juice has been found to help hospital patients with poor bloodflow sales are soaring of fibre and potassium - rich goldenberries , a dried version of the @entity40 cape gooseberry			0
predicted for success in 2014 is the gac fruit from @entity94 , a spiky orange with flesh that looks like raw meat			1
it contains lycopene — an antioxidant also found in tomatoes — which is said to combat prostate cancer			0
also coming up is the @entity104 wineberry , a miniature blueberry from @entity106 , with ‘ three to four times more antioxidants than goji berries ’			0
most of these fruits are sold dried or as juice — transporting fresh fruit raises costs			1
the nutrients will not be damaged if the drying is done carefully , but some , such as cranberries , are sprayed with sugar as part of the process			1
@entity122 juice £ 1.96 for @entity123 : the acai berry from the @entity125 contains twice the antioxidants as blueberries			1
the reality : regulators have asked firms to stop claiming antioxidants prevent cancer			0
@entity133 £ 1.50 for @entity123 : the @entity135 fruit has almost three times the antioxidants of green @entity137 reality : in a trial , 45 patients with poor blood flow were given 240ml of pomegranate juice			2
after three months they were doing better than those on a placebo			0
@entity145 £ 1.59 for @entity146 : good at fighting urinary tract @entity147 : cranberries need sugar to make them palatable — one glass of @entity153 cranberry juice contains 7 tsp. some say the acid in juice may make cystitis symptoms more painful			1
@entity157 £ 2.99 for @entity158 : grown in the @entity160 , the goldenberry is high in fibre and contains b vitamins , more iron than spinach , more fibre than prunes and more potassium than three @entity168 : good nutritional offering for the price			2
@entity171 berries £ 3.20 for @entity158 : used by herbalists to protect liver , improve sexual function and promote @entity176 reality : very high in antioxidants , but benefits are disputed			2
sex and age claims have no scientific backing			0
most juice versions of superfruits contain extra sugar in the form of concentrated apple or grape juice , which still allows them to claim ‘ no added sugar ’			1
still it seems that if eaten or drunk in moderation , none of the superfruits will do you any harm			2
but will they do you any good ? all the superfruits claim they contain a big dose of vitamin c , but the simple fact is that there are no diseases prevalent in @entity204 that have anything to do with vitamin c deficiency			1
many foods have vitamin c , including bread and jam , because acids containing it are often used as a preservative			2
the skin of a medium - sized potato will give you 45 per cent of the daily recommended dose			2
taking extra vitamin c is not believed to do much good , despite the popular belief that it fends off colds and flu			2
a review of 30 studies in 2007 concluded that the benefits of taking vitamin c supplements for such illnesses were not worth the expense			1
@entity227 , a senior dietitian for the @entity228 in @entity229 , says : ‘ we often find that people who can afford to buy these products are following a healthy , balanced diet and do not need additions			0
and they are painfully expensive			0
’ she believes the poor and unhealthy are being taken advantage of , citing one patient spending £ 75 or more on food supplements in a health shop			0
these included dried superfruits and juices , which can cost as much as £ 20 a litre			1
‘ people are gullible , especially when they are desperate for a miracle cure			0
these shops prey on them			0
some people will be living on crisps for the next week because they ca n’t afford a proper diet			0
’ so , is there anything in the superfruit claims ? the most interesting evidence is around polyphenols and bioflavonoids , found in large amounts in superfruits			1
these are forms of antioxidants , as is vitamin @entity260 oxidation produces harmful agents called free radicals that are blamed for a host of problems , from the formation of cancers to ageing			2
half of all @entity269 are said to take antioxidant supplements			0
but though millions have been spent over two decades researching antioxidants , the science is still far from convincing			0
cancer experiments have shown positive results , but only in lab animals			0
the most impressive study of berries and disease — carried out by @entity280 on 93,000 women for 18 years — did find that those who ate three portions of strawberries and blueberries a week had 34 per cent less chance of having a heart attack than those who had one portion a month			0
researchers speculated antioxidants in the berries might play a role , but so might lifestyle			0
women who rarely eat fruit are also less likely to take exercise			2
one of @entity204 ’s top toxicologists , professor @entity297 , of @entity298 , @entity299 , says that in the case of the antioxidant beta - carotene and vitamin e supplements , studies show these are more likely to raise your risk of dying early			1
a major review of studies in 2012 concluded there was not enough evidence to support people taking antioxidant supplements			0
professor @entity297 told me he has never read any science on nutrition that has persuaded him to alter his already healthy diet			0
his stark verdict is : ‘ antioxidants are useless , and some are dangerous			0
’ government regulators agree their beneficial effects have not been proved			0
in @entity322 and the @entity269 , food safety agencies have moved to try to limit manufacturers ’ claims — though with little effect , as any health food website will show			0
shops are more careful — @entity328 , @entity204 ’s largest health chain , stocks 114 products that contain antioxidants			1
but the store only says these ‘ may help ’ rather than claiming specific benefits			0
some say the best effect of superfruits may take place a long way from the bodies of those who buy them			2
the fashion for goldenberries , a high - potassium , high - fibre fruit sold in @entity346 , @entity347 and @entity328 , is bringing employment to poor farmers in the @entity160			1
growing coca for cocaine is the only other valuable crop			0
‘ all fruits are superfruits in their own way , ’ says @entity227			2
‘ none is going to guide you to the @entity358 , but try to meet the five - a - day fruit and veg aim by eating a variety of whole fruits — not just juices , which often are just sugar and flavour — and you ’ll begin to optimise your health			1

superfruits such as acai and pomegranates boast a big dose of vitamin c
but there are no prevalent illnesses in the @entity204 connected to such deficiency
many superfruit juices contain high levels of sugar and other fruit juices
