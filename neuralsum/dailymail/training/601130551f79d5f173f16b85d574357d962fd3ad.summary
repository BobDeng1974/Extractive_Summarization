when the people whose houses hug the narrow warren of streets paralleling the busiest urban freeway in @entity7 began to see bumper - to - bumper traffic crawling by their homes a year or so ago , they were baffled			1
when word spread that the explosively popular new smartphone app @entity12 was sending many of those cars through their neighborhood in a quest to shave five minutes off a daily rush - hour commute , they were angry and ready to fight back			2
they would outsmart the app , some said , by using it to report phony car crashes and traffic jams on their streets that would keep the shortcut - seekers away			1
' the traffic is unbearable now			2
you ca n't even walk your dog , ' said @entity40 , who lives on a once quiet little street @entity42 interrupted : when the people whose houses hug the narrow warren of streets paralleling the busiest urban freeway in @entity7 began to see bumper - to - bumper traffic rushing by their homes a year or so ago they were baffled months later , the cars are still there , and the people are still mad			1
' the traffic is unbearable now			2
you ca n't even walk your dog , ' said @entity30 , who lives on a once quiet little street in the @entity58 in a neighborhood called @entity34			1
@entity40 's winding little road up the low - slung mountains that separate the city 's traffic - clogged @entity62 from its equally traffic - clogged west side is now filled each weekday morning with a parade of exhaust - belching , driveway - blocking , bumper - to - bumper cars			2
so is practically every other nearby street that parallels the busy @entity71 freeway			0
on the other side of the mountain , where cars cruise down roads into tony @entity77 , traffic has also been the hot topic of late , with several people telling each other they will fool the app with their phony accident reports			1
' i do n't know if you could find anyone who would admit to doing it , but several people have said they will , ' longtime resident @entity83 said			1
if they have , they 've obviously failed			0
@entity83 said her four - mile commute to @entity92 , where she teaches a public relations class , can take two hours during rush hour			0
' the streets on the west side are no longer a secret for locals , and people are angry , ' she said			1
that 's because the app ca n't be outsmarted , @entity12 spokeswoman @entity100 said			1
cut - through ? when word spread that the explosively popular new smartphone app @entity12 was sending many of those cars through their neighborhood in a quest to shave five minutes off a daily rush - hour commute , they were angry and ready to fight back accident ahead ? some residents signed up to the app and created ' fake ' accidents in the hope that traffic would be sent elsewhere			1
the tactic failed ' with millions of users in @entity35 , fake , coordinated traffic reports ca n't come to fruition because they 'll be negated by the next 10 people that drive down the street passively using @entity12 , ' she said			1
besides , @entity100 added , ' people are inherently good , ' meaning most would n't really screw with the app , no matter what they might say			1
indeed , of all the angry people interviewed for this story , none would admit doing so , although most said they heard someone else had			2
many , however , have been complaining to local officials			0
' first thing this morning , my field deputy took an earful from a resident up there , ' said city councilman @entity137 , who represents @entity40 's neighborhood			0
there are some things that can be done to mitigate the situation , said @entity35 @entity143 spokesman @entity142 , like placing speed bumps and four - way stop signs on streets			1
lanes could even be taken out to discourage shortcut seekers , but a neighborhood traffic study would have to be done first			0
' road diet , they call it , ' @entity142 said			0
' it 's to make streets so people can walk , people can bike			2
' but the bigger problem , @entity142 said , is that everybody is using smartphone apps these days and they will quickly find every shortcut out there			0
' i plead guilty to that , ' said @entity165 , who is president of the @entity166 that represents @entity40 's neighborhood			0
as soon as he gets over the hill to @entity83 's neighborhood , @entity165 said , he uses the app to find the fastest route to his office in @entity173			0
@entity83 herself admitted she uses @entity12 and also @entity175 to get around town			0
get used to it : using a smartphone along with gps , @entity12 is just one of many apps that is changing the way we live our lives which seems to speak to @entity100 's contention that the real problem facing @entity35 residents is n't the traffic app. it 's the traffic			1
@entity189 has 7.6 million registered vehicles , more than some states			0
the @entity192 that parallels the unhappy neighborhoods carries 379,000 cars a day			0
so while a shortcut down a sleepy street might not be a problem in a place like @entity200 or even @entity201 , it 's a different story in a city that last year was again ranked no. 1 for the nation 's most time - consuming traffic jams			1
' @entity35 is a powder keg of cars , construction and population that will only continue to get worse , ' @entity100 said she wrote to a person from the 405 neighborhood who complained			2
' with or without @entity12 , drivers will be looking for alternatives to major thoroughfares			0

people living in @entity34 in @entity35 used to enjoy the peace and quiet on their secluded streets
drivers keen to save time were directed down their residential roads creating *lengthy* traffic jams
some residents even created ' fake accidents ' on the app to try and keep traffic away but it did n't work
