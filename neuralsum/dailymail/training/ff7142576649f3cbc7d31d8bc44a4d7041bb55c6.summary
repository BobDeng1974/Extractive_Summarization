it took until the end of december before @entity2 became the first @entity4 manager sacked this season but the overall trend towards greater managerial instability still deepens , especially at @entity9 clubs			1
across the top four tiers of @entity13 football , there were 34 managerial changes and 27 dismissals between the start of the season and december 31			2
this beats the previous high of 24 , set last season â€“ and there were 12 dismissals in the @entity9 , which is also a record , five more than in the previous two years			2
@entity24 ( second left ) was @entity25 manager ... one of four to have the role this season @entity2 was the first @entity4 manager to go this season ... from @entity28 in december 2005 - 06 : 13 2006 - 07 : 22 2007 - 08 : 20 2008 - 09 : 19 2009 - 10 : 19 2010 - 11 : 14 2011 - 12 : 13 2012 - 13 : 21 2013 - 14 : 24 2014 - 15 : 27 the numbers may be warped by unusual goings on at @entity31 ( four different managers this season ) and @entity25 ( three ) but this season is on course to create a new record of managerial departures , set at 46 in 2006 - 07			1
one of the most disturbing trends for the @entity39 , which released these figures today as part of its quarterly review , is that those managers dismissed during the current campaign were only in their jobs for an average of 1.04 years			1
the average for those sacked in the top three tiers has been less than a year			0
@entity51 , fired from @entity52 after nearly five years , and @entity53 , who departed @entity54 after more than three , boosted the average tenure figures in @entity56			0
thirteen of the 27 dismissals have been managers serving for the first time in the top four divisions of @entity13 football			0
will they return to the job ? really , why would you ? @entity54 's @entity53 was at the club for three years , bucking the trend for length of tenure			0

there were 34 managerial changes in the first half of the 2014/15 season
@entity31 have had four different managers this season , and @entity25 three
managers dismissed during the this season lasted an average of 1.04 years
@entity2 was the first @entity4 manager to be sacked this term
