click here to read @entity2 's full match report @entity4 ' decision to field a weakened team for @entity8 's @entity7 clash against @entity9 was not the unmitigated disaster many predicted			1
the @entity11 lost by a smaller margin than their 3 - 0 home defeat to the reigning champions - but @entity17 's match winning strike still leaves @entity8 's @entity19 hopes in the balance			1
@entity22 's @entity21 was at the @entity23 to pick out a few points ... @entity17 celebrates scoring the opening goal as @entity8 's defence appeal for offside one of the few surprises was that @entity28 did not get on the scoresheet going cheap one of the advantages of having an enormous stadium is that you can afford to offer a few tickets at more affordable prices			2
so it was on tuesday night that @entity9 were still selling tickets for about Â£ 30 for this game right until kick - off			0
mind you , those seeing @entity8 's team sheet may have asked for their money back			0
@entity4 decision to field a weakened team made cut price tickets look less value for money @entity9 manager @entity48 gives @entity4 a sideways glance as managers watch from the sidelines @entity52 , @entity53 in his interview with @entity22 last week , @entity54 talked dismissively of the way @entity57 sent out a weakened team to try and frustrate @entity8 at @entity59 towards the end of last season			1
' for me , they just destroyed the game and broke it up , ' said the @entity8 captain			0
it 's hard not to wonder what he made of @entity4 ' selection			0
@entity54 's comments about facing @entity72 's second string came back to haunt him at the @entity23 @entity54 and @entity73 ( @entity74 ) warm up at the @entity23 after being left out of the starting line - up not such a safe pair of hands interesting that amid all the team changes , goalkeeper @entity78 kept his place			2
one of the more worrying aspects of @entity8 's current problems is the lack of the reliable and genuinely threatening back up goalkeeper			0
another issue for @entity4 to ponder			0
@entity8 keeper @entity78 crashes into teammate @entity85 as he attempts a save from @entity17 @entity78 ( @entity74 ) can only watch as @entity9 teammates celebrate taking a first half lead @entity89 and @entity90 during what was admittedly a very one - sided first half , the only occasions that @entity9 ever looked remotely uncomfortable was when @entity8 ran at them directly			1
@entity95 almost got through on a couple of occasions but all that did was make you wonder what may have happened had the lightening @entity101 been playing			2
most of @entity8 's best moves in the first - half came from the flank patrolled by @entity95 had @entity8 decided to start with @entity101 , the outcome may have been different			1

@entity8 lost 1 - 0 to @entity9 in their @entity7 clash
@entity17 scored the match winning goal with a first - half strike
@entity4 rested players incl . @entity54 and @entity101
@entity78 kept his place in goal but looked far from *convincing*
@entity95 was at the heart of the @entity11 ' best moves at the @entity23
