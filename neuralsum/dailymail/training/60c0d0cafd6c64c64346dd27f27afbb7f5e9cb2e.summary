@entity1 supporters have defended their right to sing a crude version of the popular @entity5 song ' delilah ' following a call in @entity7 for it to be ditched as a rugby anthem			1
@entity1 fans can regularly be heard bellowing the 1968 @entity11 number two hit , replacing the lyric about killing a woman with wording that could be considered sexually offensive			1
former @entity17 president @entity16 has called on @entity7 rugby supporters at @entity20 's @entity19 to find something else to sing , claiming the song ' trivialises the idea of murdering a woman '			1
@entity1 supporters celebrate @entity26 ' goal against @entity27 at a heaving @entity28 @entity29 , written by @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , tells of an opportunistic killing by a man , who waits until his former partner 's lover leaves her home before making his move			1
the @entity39 appears disinclined to ban the song , and @entity1 fans may also be reluctant to give it up			1
@entity42 , a spokesman for the @entity43 , said : ' it 's just a song we sing to encourage the team			0
' @entity29 ' has become an unofficial anthem for @entity39 rugby fans and sir @entity5 has even sung it to the crowds at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity7			1
however , a campaign to ban it has now been launched i saw the light on the night that i passed by her window i saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind she was my woman as she deceived me i watched and went out of my mind my , my , my , @entity29 why , why , why , @entity29 i could see that girl was no good for me but i was lost like a slave that no man could free at break of day when that man drove away , i was waiting i cross the street to her house and she opened the door she stood there laughing i felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more my , my , my @entity29 why , why , why @entity29 so before they come to break down the door forgive me delilah i just could nâ€™t take any more ' i do n't think anybody among the fans would ever even think it has anything to do with domestic violence			1
' it 's all tongue - in - cheek and i 'm sure it 's just an issue of today 's society where 99 per cent of the country just get on with it but someone looks for a hidden meaning			0
' the song , in its original form , includes the lyrics : ' at break of day when that man drove away , i was waiting			0
' i cross the street to her house and she opened the door			0
' she stood there laughing ...			0
i felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more			0
' the @entity1 supporters ' version changes the central lyric to : ' i put my d * * * in her hand and she laughed no more			2
' @entity16 , who held his senior role with @entity17 , the @entity17 , from 2003 to 2010 , is also a folk singer			0
@entity16 said : ' it is a song about murder and it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman and it 's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem			2
i think we should rummage around for another song instead of @entity29			0
' a spokesman for the @entity39 said : ' within rugby , @entity29 has gained prominence through its musicality rather than because of its lyrics			1
' there is , however , plenty of precedent in art and literature , prominently in @entity130 tragedies for instance , for negative aspects of life to be portrayed			0
' the @entity39 condemns violence against women and has taken a lead role in police campaigns to highlight and combat the issue			2
' the @entity39 remains willing to listen to any strong public debate on the issue of censoring the use of @entity29 but we have not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter			2
