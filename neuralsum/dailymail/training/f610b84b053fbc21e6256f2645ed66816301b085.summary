@entity1 head coach @entity0 insists @entity2 are still a force and warned his side to treat them with respect			1
the @entity1 host @entity2 on monday and @entity0 reckons the former champions are still a top draw			1
@entity2 chief @entity9 has seen his side lose 5 - 3 at @entity10 and stunned 4 - 0 in the @entity11 by @entity12 already this season			1
they are 11 points behind @entity16 leaders @entity17 following @entity19 's stuttering start since replacing @entity20 in the summer			1
he said : ' they are still @entity2 and have some great players			2
it 's going to be a huge game for our club , players and fans			0
' when the fixtures come out most people up and down the country look to see when they are playing @entity2 at home			2
' they have been a fantastic team over the years but the squad was looking like it was going to need some changes and i read something from sir @entity48 saying it has needed an overhaul			2
' it was getting to that time and @entity20 inherited that situation			0
it 's a period of transition			2
' @entity2 have been dominant for many years so they are eventually going to have to change and that 's the situation they are in at the moment			1
' @entity20 ( left ) was replaced by @entity19 and @entity25 ( right ) worked with him as a coach at @entity58 the @entity1 have won three of their last four games after failing to win their opening four league matches			0
@entity2 have beaten @entity58 and @entity62 in their last two outings and @entity0 has called on @entity1 to shut them down early			1
' they will work the ball out and we 've got to make sure they do n't get moves started easily , ' he said			0
' we 've done our video work and there are clips of them scoring goals where it starts with the goalkeeper and ends up in the back of the net			0
' clearly that involves a lot of control and a lot of movement and good positioning of their players			0
' we 've got to be really well organised when we do n't have the ball in order to stop them building these attacks			0
' but one of the things we 've spoken about is the need for us to be really good with the ball and not give it back really cheaply to players of the quality of @entity2			0
' Ã‚ @entity2 and @entity1 go head to head on monday night in the @entity16 at the @entity96			1
