by @entity0 it is a stunning new perspective on the desolate surface than man walked onto for the first time on july 20th , 1969 , a little after 4:00 in the afternoon @entity5			0
@entity6 has revealed a 3d ' flyby ' of the spot where @entity9 landed on the @entity10 the @entity11 , nicknamed @entity11 and flown by @entity12 and @entity13 , touched down near the southern rim of the @entity15 , one of the large , dark basins that contribute to the @entity18 visible from @entity19			1
each image in the pair shows the site from a slightly different angle , allowing sophisticated software to infer the shape of the terrain , similar to the way that left and right eye views are combined in the brain to produce the perception of depth			0
the animator draped an @entity24 photograph over the terrain model			1
he also added a 3d model of the @entity11 descent stage — the real @entity11 in the photograph looks oddly flat when viewed at an oblique angle			1
the new imagery makes it possible to visit the landing site in a whole new way by flying around a three - dimensional model of the site			0
the new @entity22 footage was constructed from images taken by the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
@entity12 and @entity13 spent about two hours outside the @entity11 setting up experiments and collecting samples			1
at one point , @entity12 ventured east of the @entity11 to examine a small crater , dubbed @entity56 , that he 'd flown over just before landing			2
the trails of disturbed regolith created by the astronauts ' boots are still clearly visible in photographs of the landing site taken by the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) narrow - angle camera ( @entity24 ) more than four decades later			2
@entity24 scientists created the digital elevation model using a stereo pair of images			1
each image in the pair shows the site from a slightly different angle , allowing sophisticated software to infer the shape of the terrain , similar to the way that left and right eye views are combined in the brain to produce the perception of depth			0
the lunar modile on the moon , and the trail left by astronaut boots visible in the new image ( right ) the animator then draped an @entity24 photograph over the terrain model			2
he also added a 3d model of the @entity11 descent stage — the real @entity11 in the photograph looks oddly flat when viewed at an oblique angle			1
although the area around the site is relatively flat by lunar standards , @entity92 ( the big brother of the crater visited by @entity12 ) appears in dramatic relief near the eastern edge of the terrain model			0
@entity101 from @entity102 comprises the boulders that @entity12 had to avoid as he searched for a safe landing site			0
@entity9 was the first of six increasingly ambitious crewed lunar landings			0
the exploration of the lunar surface by the @entity109 astronauts , when combined with the wealth of remote sensing data now being returned by @entity24 , continues to inform our understanding of our nearest neighbor in space , @entity6 said .			0
