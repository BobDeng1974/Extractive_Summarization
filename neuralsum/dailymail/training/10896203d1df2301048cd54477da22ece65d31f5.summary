as of march 1 about 4.2 million @entity0 had signed up for medical insurance coverage through the @entity2 , according to numbers released tuesday by the @entity5 administration			1
but it remains unclear how many of those enrollees have put their money where their mouse is			0
combined figures published by @entity2 marketplaces in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 indicate that just 79 per cent of signups in those states have come with checks attached			2
if those numbers were to hold up nationally , it would mean that about 1.1 million @entity2 enrollees have selected insurance plans without paying for them – bringing the actual total of @entity2 - insured @entity0 down to 3.3 million			1
@entity29 secretary @entity28 continues to plug the @entity2 insurance coverage system despite enrollment numbers that have been less than expected desperate or smart ? on tuesday the @entity32 defended its decision to send president @entity5 out to do an interview with ' @entity36 ' mini-show host @entity35 , saying the satire website immediately became the number - one online referrer to @entity39 the @entity40 reported in late february that ' at least three - quarters ' of plans sold by three insurers in @entity44 have been paid for			1
february brought 943,000 new people into the @entity2 fold , bringing the @entity47 per cent of the way to the @entity29 ' original goal of enrolling 7 million @entity0 by the end of march			1
@entity29 secretary @entity28 told reporters on a conference call tuesday that the administration expects a march surge to close the gap			0
last month she backed off from the prediction of 7 million new insurance customers , saying the new target was 6 million			1
the 4.2 million total is 70 per cent of that lower benchmark number			0
the reconfiguration of the administration 's goal came after a chronically ill beginning for @entity2 , marked by national confusion , website outages and an implementation cost that has exceeded two - thirds of 1 trillion dollars			0
about one - quarter of the enrollees since the program 's october 1 launch have been adults in the 18 - 35 age range			0
those desirable , mostly healthy people were originally expected to be one - third of the total , paying into the system to offset the staggering costs of treating older , sicker @entity0			0
as the march 31 deadline ending the open - enrollment season approaches , the @entity32 has yet to release any statistics showing how many people have paid the first month 's premium for their new insurance policies			1
@entity84 ! @entity5 promoted his signature health insurance law in a town - hall event for hispanic - americans at the @entity88 in @entity18 , @entity18 > on march 6 controversy : restaurants like @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 have begun adding 1 - percent @entity2 surcharges to customers ' checks in order to pay for the increasing cost of coverage under the new law a @entity101 spokesman told @entity102 last month that the agency has n't ' prioritized ' reporting its payment statistics , but plans to do so ' once our automated payment systems are completed and fully tested			1
' @entity101 manages health insurance exchanges for 14 states and the @entity18			0
all together , the seven states where both enrollment and payment numbers have been published have signed up 1.05 million people , but reported that just 835,000 have paid premiums			1
more troubling for the @entity5 administration is a survey published last week by the consultancy @entity117 , which found that only 27 per cent of new enrollees – or 1.14 million of the total announced tuesday – were uninsured before they signed up			1
millions of insured @entity0 received cancellation letters from their insurers in october , november and december , spurred by the companies ' recognition that their existing offerings did n't satisfy the @entity2 's stringent minimum standards			0
mixed messages : a smaller percentage of @entity0 are uninsured than 6 months or a year ago , but the number has gone up overall during the @entity5 presidency those requirements include a host of coverage options – maternity coverage required for male customers , for instance – that critics say policyholders should n't have to pay for			2
@entity117 also found that just 1 in 10 @entity0 who are eligible for @entity2 policies have chosen to enroll			0
adding insult to injury , a @entity140 poll released monday shows that while the percentage of uninsured @entity0 has dropped from 17.1 per cent at the end of 2013 to just 15.9 per cent now , that number stood at just 14.4 per cent before @entity5 took office			2
it 's also not clear what will happen to taxpayers whose have not made payments by march 31			0
the @entity5 administration has asked some insurers to extend payment deadlines and provide enrollees with a grace period , but executives at two insurance companies have told @entity102 that they do n't intend to do so .			2

as march 31 deadline approaches , the administration is nowhere near its original goal of 7 million signups – or its *revised* target of 6 million
but the administration has n't said how many have paid their premiums , *claming* their accounts - payable system is n't yet set up to compute totals
seven @entity0 states , however , have released their paid / *unpaid* numbers , and those figures indicate that just 3.3 million have paid for insurance
the @entity32 has asked insurers to cut *delinquent* enrollees some *slack* , but some insurance execs say they wo n't do it
a troubling survey from a health care consultancy found last week that just 27 per cent of enrollees were *previously* uninsured
