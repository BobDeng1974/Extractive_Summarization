by @entity0 @entity1 took part in a trial using stem cells to repair heart damage a major new trial is using patients ' own stem cells to treat heart failure			1
one of the first to benefit is @entity1 , 41 , an archaeology student from @entity11 , @entity12			1
he tells @entity13 davis his story			0
working as a supply teacher a few years ago , i started feeling exhausted			2
i could n't walk more than 50 metres without pausing , was constantly breathless and would wake at night coughing			0
at first i thought it was a cold or flu , or the stress of a house move			0
but my mum , a retired nurse , pointed out i 'd been ill for two months , and sent me to the doctor			0
the @entity24 suspected asthma , and gave me an inhaler			0
but within a week it was worse and i could n't walk more than a few yards without retching			0
so i saw a second gp			0
she did n't say what she thought it was - she called an ambulance instead			2
i was admitted to the @entity32 in @entity33 , then transferred to the @entity34 in @entity35 while they ran several tests , including an @entity38 ( electrocardiogram ) and @entity40 ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan			0
doctors explained i had heart failure : part of my heart muscle was damaged and the lower pumping chamber had become flabby so could n't pump blood round my body properly			1
this was why i was so exhausted			0
it could have been caused by a virus , although sometimes it 's genetic			0
but there 's no family history of heart disease and i was very fit - i was a former policeman - so the diagnosis was a real shock			2
i left hospital with medication to help my heart , including beta blockers to relieve the load on the heart , @entity60 inhibitors to dilate my blood vessels and help the heart pump better , as well as diuretics and warfarin to thin the blood and stop it clotting			2
the risk with heart failure is that blood can pool in the heart 's chambers and is more likely to clot , which can cause a heart attack			1
i had to take six months off work , and felt incredibly weak and breathless			0
as my heart was permanently damaged , i had a pacemaker and defibrillator implanted the following year to keep my heart beating regularly			2
this stopped me getting any worse , but i was still weak			0
i could n't run more than ten minutes on the treadmill at the gym			0
stem cells were taken from the bone marrow in @entity1 's hip , and injected into his heart i 'd read online that many heart failure patients die within five years , which was a terrifying prospect			1
so i gave up work and started an archaeology degree , which i 'd always wanted to do			0
then , in june 2009 i read in @entity94 about a woman with a damaged heart valve who 'd had a new treatment in @entity99 to have stem cells injected into the valve to repair it			1
a trial using stem cells to treat heart failure was starting at the @entity106 and i asked to join it			1
the doctors explained that stem cells can potentially grow into any cell , including heart muscle cells , for reasons doctors do n't yet fully understand			1
stem cells would be taken from the bone marrow in my hip , and injected into my heart			1
the treatment started in december 2010 and involved me first having a daily injection of a protein that stimulates the bone marrow for five days			1
i then had a local anaesthetic while doctors used a large syringe to take bone marrow from my hip			1
this was then sent to the lab to have the stem cells removed			1
later that day , i was given a local anaesthetic and sedated for the hour - long procedure , to transplant the stem cells			1
the consultant , professor @entity131 , fed a thin flexible tube up through the artery in my thigh to my heart , then fed the fluid containing the stem cells into it			1
at first i felt no different			0
since it was a trial , i knew some patients would have stem cells and the rest a placebo			1
but over the next few years i felt better and better			2
eventually , i was able to run for more than an hour on the treadmill , far more than i 'd managed in police training			0
i suspected i 'd had the stem cells and last july professor @entity131 confirmed it - i was elated but not surprised			1
now , six years after my diagnosis , i do six miles of @entity149 walking - trekking using poles - every other day , have climbed mountains , have more stamina than people half my age and my breathing is back to normal			2
i 'm still classed as having heart failure and still take my medication but feel completely better - it 's life - changing			1
it 's relatively safe and the risk is similar to what people experience in an angioplasty and stent procedure professor @entity131 is a consultant cardiologist at @entity164 in @entity106 and professor of cardiology at @entity167			0
heart disease is @entity170 's biggest killer , with 103,000 heart attacks in the @entity170 annually			0
but since we are getting better at treating heart attacks there are now more than a million people living with heart failure , when the heart can no longer pump sufficient blood around the body			1
it causes breathlessness because the heart does not supply blood to other organs properly			0
this is especially noticeable in the lungs			0
doctors can try treating heart failure with medication to help heart function , or by fitting a pacemaker and defibrillator to help it beat properly			2
but for the past ten years i have worked with the @entity194 , which has helped fund the regenerate trials			0
these have treated different groups of patients with their stem cells			2
some patients had had a recent heart attack , others had heart failure caused by heart disease or by a virus ( which probably happened in @entity1 's case )			1
the trials produced significant results			0
following the trials ' success , we are now involved in the world 's largest ever trial of stem cell therapy in heart attack patients			2
the @entity217 study will treat 3,000 patients across @entity219 to see if administering stem cells within a few days of a heart attack will prolong life by helping repair the heart and keeping it working properly			1
we use stem cells taken from bone marrow - a good source , and a well - tested procedure			1
heart failure patients begin with five days of injections of a growth factor , but in the @entity217 trial we do n't do this because we want to treat them soon after the heart attack			1
we then take 50 - 100ml of bone marrow from their hip , which is processed to collect white blood cells , which contain the stem cells			1
a catheter - a thin flexible tube - is inserted through the artery in the groin to the main artery to the heart ; we also inject a dye so we can see the coronary arteries supplying the heart on an @entity249 we feed the catheter into the coronary arteries - before we inject the stem cells , we inflate a tiny balloon to block the artery so the cells will not flow back out			1
some cells will be flushed out , but we hope some will find their way to the damaged heart muscle and help to repair it , which takes six to 12 months			2
results from the regenerate trials have already shown we can help patients with damaged hearts			0
we hope the newest trial will show we could help many more , so this could one day become a standard treatment after a heart attack			2
it 's relatively safe and the risk is similar to what people experience in an angioplasty and stent procedure - where we open blocked arteries using a tiny metal tube			0
the procedure costs the @entity279 about Â£ 10,000 and is only available as part of the @entity217 trial at the @entity106 run by @entity164 .			0

@entity1 , 41 , from @entity12 is one of first to benefit from trial
some *participants* were given stem cells and the rest placebo
stem cells were taken from bone marrow in his hip and injected into heart
years later @entity1 feels better - but still classed as having heart failure
