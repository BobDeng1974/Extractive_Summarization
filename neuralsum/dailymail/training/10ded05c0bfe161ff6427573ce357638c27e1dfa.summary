this time last year @entity0 was excitedly planning her future			2
after achieving good grades in her higher exams , the popular ‘ fun - loving ’ schoolgirl had applied to university with dreams of becoming a lawyer			1
her proud family had just welcomed her back from a charitable mission to help orphaned children in @entity12 – for which she raised thousands of pounds - and she had been invited to talk at an event alongside @entity15			1
but on a night out with friends at the @entity17 in @entity18 in early february , the 17 - year - old fell victim to @entity21 ’s deadly ‘ party drug ’ culture			1
hard - working : @entity23 was a fun - loving teen who adored her family her death from ecstasy sent shockwaves across the country – and her distraught family were left asking ‘ why ? ’ now , for the first time , her parents have spoken publicly about the tragedy and paid tribute to ‘ a girl who brought a smile to everyone she met ’			1
in an exclusive interview with the @entity40 on the eve of the anniversary of @entity0 ’s death , her father @entity37 and mother @entity38 revealed their horror at finding out she had been rushed to hospital , the anxious wait for news and the boundless grief when the teen lost her fight for life			0
they also issued an emotional warning about the trail of destruction left behind by drugs and urged fellow parents to ‘ talk honestly to their kids ’			1
‘ people always think it will never happen to them – but it can , ’ mr @entity37 , 43 , said			1
‘ there is nothing worse than losing a child and i hate to think of other families going through the pain we have experienced this past year			1
‘ i would ask parents to sit down with their kids and be honest with them about how dangerous trying drugs just once can be			2
perfect daughter : @entity0 as a child with her mother @entity73			0
her parents still do not know exactly what happened in the hours leading up to @entity0 ’s death ‘ if anyone could see the devastation it can cause before they take something they would think twice			2
’ miss @entity38 , 42 , said : ‘ our lives will never be the same			1
we will have to live with this pain for the rest of our days			0
‘ @entity85 goes on but this can not be healed			2
’ her parents still do not know exactly what happened in the hours leading up to @entity0 ’s death but toxicology reports showed she had the class a drug mdma – found in ecstasy tablets – in her system			1
doctors fought for hours in an attempt to save the 17 - year - old - a sixth year pupil at @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 - after she collapsed at the late night club venue but she died later that day with her parents at her bedside			1
in the weeks surrounding the tragedy , police put out repeated warnings to young people to beware of a particularly strong strain of ecstasy known as @entity108			0
the red coloured pills , which are stamped with a dragon logo , were linked to the hospitalisations of three other young people at that time			0
however her parents never considered that their studious and responsible eldest child might find herself in a position where she would try drugs			0
‘ it was just not like her ’ , miss @entity38 said			1
‘ she had never given us reason to worry by coming home really late or really drunk and was the responsible one in her group			2
’ mr @entity37 continued : ‘ we never felt the need to explicitly warn her not to do it			1
we could talk about anything with her and , of course , drugs and their dangers came up but we never felt we had to sit her down and tell her ‘ do not do that tonight ’			1
’ @entity0 , pictured with her father @entity131			2
he said : ‘ people always think it will never happen to them but it can ' they learned she was in trouble after @entity137 received a worried phone call from her nephew who was inside the ambulance with @entity0 in the early hours of february 2 last year			1
‘ i was in bed when i got a call in the middle of the night from @entity0 ’s cousin who was in the ambulance with her , ’ miss @entity38 said			1
‘ he said she was n’t well and was going to hospital and that i needed to come quickly			2
it is all a blur but i remember thinking that maybe she had suffered an asthma attack or had drunk too much alcohol			0
‘ i called her dad and we all headed to the hospital			2
at no point did we realise how serious it was			0
we all hoped she would be ok			0
’ mr @entity37 added : ‘ we still do not know exactly what happened inside the @entity17			1
we know she became separated from her friends and that at the end of the night she became very unwell			1
‘ we were told that @entity0 ’s body had taken a reaction to a substance and learned that some other young people who had been in the club had been hospitalised after apparently taking @entity108 ecstasy pills			2
‘ one thing we do know is that our daughter was not a regular drug user			1
’ @entity0 ’s heartbroken mother is determined she be remembered ‘ not for how she died , but who she was ’			1
‘ she was a fun - loving and caring girl			1
she was smart and vivacious and was just starting to spread her wings in the world , ’ miss @entity38 said			2

there she visited schools and orphanages to teach them about @entity21 culture and saw first - hand how the money raised for the cause was helping disadvantaged children			1
mr @entity37 said : ‘ she spent three weeks in @entity181 with the most basic of facilities , visiting schools and an orphanage			2
‘ we were worried she would struggle with it all , as she was a girl who liked to look good and was used to comfortable surroundings , but she surprised everyone			1
she took to it like a duck to water			0
‘ she had grown up so much when she returned			2
she was less bothered about material things and how she looked and was so much more confident			0
‘ she worked so hard to raise money for the charity , which has links with her school , and had been offered the chance to return this year			1
’ miss @entity38 said : ‘ that was the first time she had been away from her family for such a long time and we struggled not being able to contact her for the first ten days			1
we worried about her , as all parents do			0

’ she added : ‘ @entity244 was always incredibly important to @entity0			1
she put her family first and was a great big sister			2
it hurts so much that her siblings wo n’t have her as an influence any more			0

’ the support of family , friends and their local community in @entity97 , @entity98 have helped over the past 12 months but @entity0 ’s parents ’ pain still remains ‘ very raw ’			1
miss @entity38 said : ‘ we are still in total disbelief			0
‘ it does n’t feel real			0
if my phones rings i still think it might be her			0
i still hope she will walk into the kitchen with that beautiful smile and tell me a funny story about her day			0
mr @entity37 said : ‘ i could look at her photographs for hours and it feels like she is there with me			0
’ despite separating when @entity0 was very young , her parents remain close and have supported each other through the most difficult stages of grief			0
as well as her parents , @entity0 also had a particularly strong bond with her younger brothers @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 , little sister @entity284 and her step - parents			0
her step - mother @entity289 said : ‘ her brothers and sisters still talk about her all the time			2
it is hard to hear because we are still hurting but also lovely because they are keeping her memory alive			0
they keep us going and tell us that @entity0 would not want us to be sad			0
‘ @entity0 shared a room with her little sister @entity284 , who is 10 , and recently she has been struggling because she does n’t have her to talk to			0
