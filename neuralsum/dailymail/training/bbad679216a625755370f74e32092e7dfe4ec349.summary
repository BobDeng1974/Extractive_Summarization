by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 03:53 est , 19 june 2012 only half of all youngsters have heard of @entity3 despite the boy wizard being the star of eight hit movies and the best - selling book series in history , according to a new poll			1
fewer still - a quarter of seven to 14 - year - olds - had discovered him through reading , says the study suggesting traditional children ’s characters are readily forgotten			1
other literary heroes have suffered an even worse fate in their memories as novels drift out of the national consciousness in what researchers say is due to the rise of tv and video game entertainment			1
movie hit : @entity28 as @entity3 in last year 's final installment of the movie series based on the seven best - selling books by @entity32			1
despite its success , however , only half of all children heave heard of the character fewer than one in ten had read @entity37 and @entity38 , according to the study by @entity40			1
around one in six of the 500 children questioned said it was not @entity43 that lived in the @entity45 , but @entity47 's @entity46			2
while around one in eight thought the mountains were home to @entity50			0
and although over half knew that @entity52 was a lion , nearly one in five suggested he was a giraffe and and the same proportion said he was a bear			2
there was also further confusion over @entity61 's classic novel			0
a quarter would have been surprised to find themselves in @entity64 , with 17 per cent saying the wardrobe led to the @entity66 and eight per cent believing it ended up in @entity68			0
three fifths of the youngsters questioned knew that @entity71 appeared in @entity72 , but one in ten thought he was from @entity73			1
@entity74 , @entity75 and a what ? a fifth of children questioned thought @entity80 , the beast hero of the chronicles of @entity83 , series was a giraffe confusing : one in five also thought @entity72 pirate @entity71 ( played on stage by @entity85 , right ) was in @entity73 ( @entity86 as captain hook in the 2003 film , left ) the survey found that classic children 's characters like @entity92 and @entity93 meant nothing to three quarters of the nation 's children			1
it found that just one in four youngsters had heard of these characters , although @entity101 and @entity102 were better known ( 46 per cent and 45 per cent respectively )			2
yet it is the lack of knowledge about @entity3 that is most astonishing			2
enduring appeal : @entity47 was voted children 's favourite author the seven books chronicling the adventures of the ‘ muggle ’ who became a wizard have sold 450million copies since the first novel was published only 15 years ago			0
and the last of the eight movies , the second part of @entity3 and the @entity117 , was only released last year – meaning it should be fresh in youngsters ’ memory			1
one author whose popularity has endured , however , is @entity47			0
he topped the list with a third of votes compared with @entity3 ’s creator @entity32 with 21 per cent			2
a third of the children had read @entity131 , with @entity132 and @entity128 also enduring with 29 and 28 per cent of youngsters reading these books )			0
professor @entity135 , director of the international forum for research in children 's literature , at @entity40 said : ‘ thankfully to counteract this possible downturn in children experiencing the classics , there is still a very strong interest in our rich literary heritage			0
' this is clearly demonstrated by the popularity of the courses in children 's literature currently run across the @entity150 and also internationally			0
‘ there are many students studying children 's literature at undergraduate , @entity155 and doctoral levels at the @entity40			0
‘ those students are parents , teachers and would - be teachers who will bring their knowledge and enjoyment to generations of children , engaging them in journeys into worlds of the imagination where they will bring to life past characters and present heroes such as those in @entity172 's series @entity173 , @entity175 's @entity174 and @entity177 's @entity176			1
’ the poll was conducted to mark the opening of @entity180 , a joint university and public library .			0
