by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 13:55 est , 7 november 2012 found alive : @entity2 's disappearance sparked a massive hunt by police and his devastated daughters a @entity7 multimillionaire with dementia who vanished without trace two years ago has been found alive with a new wife and stepson - who now stand to inherit his vast fortune			1
@entity2 disappeared from his home in @entity14 , @entity15 , on december 15 2010 , sparking a massive hunt by police and his devastated daughters @entity18 , 61 , and @entity19 , 55			1
but when the women finally found him , say the only contact they have had with their father since his reappearance has been through his new wife , @entity25 , and her son , @entity26			1
the new family claims he is happy in @entity28 and has demonstrated his love for them by signing over all of his property and wealth to them - including giving them access to his bank accounts			1
now , in a legal first in @entity7 , @entity18 and @entity19 have filed a lawsuit against @entity25 and @entity40 , whose surnames do not appear on court papers , claiming embezzlement and false imprisonment			1
they claim the mother and son effectively kidnapped their father - who they say suffers from @entity50 - and brainwashed him into leaving them all his money			0
they now want him returned to @entity7 where they say he can get the care and supervision he needs			0
the retired entrepreneur , who made his fortune in the fruit wholesale business , had several million euros in his bank accounts as well as seven luxury properties in @entity7			0
mr @entity2 is said to have met @entity25 after the death of his first wife			2
a sports - car enthusiast , he enjoyed a lavish lifestyle , splashing out on luxury homes across the town in which he lived			0
vanished : mr @entity2 , 86 , disappeared from his home in @entity14 , @entity15 , in 2010			1
his new family say he is happy and does not wish to be contacted but in around 2005 , @entity18 says his mind began to deteriorate , and he began forgetting basic facts about her such as what she did for a living and even her age			1
he had also begun a relationship with @entity25			0
from that point , @entity18 claims contact with her father steadily declined until it completely fizzled out			1
he stopped answering her phone calls and letters and even missed his sister 's funeral in september 2009			0
then came a letter , apparently signed by mr @entity2 , apologising for being so difficult to contact because he had been busy walking and travelling			2
' if i have time , i 'll write again , ' he wrote			0
in the following months , he wrote a handful of letters , including one to cancel plans to spend @entity90 with his daughters			2
then his correspondence completely dried up			0
but , while the handwriting was undoubtedly his , @entity18 and @entity19 claim the words and phrases in his final letters appeared less and less familiar , as though they had been dictated to him			1
they filed a missing persons report in december 2010 and , in january 2012 , a court in @entity14 ruled him to be in ' imminent danger ' and expressed ' real doubts over the honesty ' of @entity25 and @entity26 , according to newspaper @entity102			1
while @entity18 says she has all but given up hope of seeing any of her father 's fortune , she says she just wants to see him again			2
' i can not sleep , am nervous and broken , ' she told @entity102			0
' i am in a state of grief			0
' but @entity26 , mr @entity2 's de facto spokesman , apparently wrote in a letter to the court : ' mr. @entity2 is a staunch , former entrepreneur and does what he wants ... [ he ] enjoys his life as a free citizen			2
