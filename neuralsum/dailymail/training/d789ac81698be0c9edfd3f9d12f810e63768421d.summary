there ’s something in @entity3 ’s eyes that ’s making me even more excited about this rematch between him and @entity7			2
we all know this is a grudge match and that they do n’t like each other			1
they hate each other , really			1
but i always had a bit of a thought that the spite was mostly coming from @entity7 ’s side			2
for two years it ’s all he talks to me about : ‘ i want to fight @entity3			1
’ he ’ll constantly tell me how much he hates him , ca n’t stand him , even the look of him			2
he has nothing but violent thoughts towards him			2
with @entity3 , i ’ve always had the feeling it was maybe a bit more relaxed			2
this rematch was always on his agenda and it was a big part of our conversations when he signed with us			2
then , after he and @entity7 won in @entity33 earlier in the month , i saw a slightly different side			1
@entity7 got up close , they nearly went for it and i saw in @entity3 right there that he was willing to go , at ringside			0
exchange : a war of words broke out between @entity3 and @entity7 in @entity33 heated : the two warring @entity43 fighters will meet again in the ring in november speaking their mind : both @entity3 and @entity7 are interviewed by @entity47 's @entity46 he wanted to fight right there			1
he wants this fight as much as @entity7 does			1
as a promoter this is good and bad			0
if this spills out of control , it will be bad for all of us			0
these guys are role models and it has to happen in the ring			0
but on the other hand , when the grudge is authentic and the fighters are well matched , then you have something special			1
i 'd say there is much more venom in this than @entity69 - @entity68			1
i think this fight will be something special			1
at the moment i am going over some of the final logistics			0
i ’m down to two main options – november 29 in the @entity75 or november 1 at the men in @entity77			1
@entity77 will hold more , about 20,000 versus 12,000 , but my instinct is leaning towards @entity33			1
i have to take my hat off to @entity3 , he went to @entity7 's back yard before and he is willing to do it again but ultimately the numbers will decide			0
i can reveal here that i 'm working to ensure this fight is a final eliminator for a world title , even though i believe the winner and loser will go on to fight for a world title			1
title or not , this fight is huge			1
challenge : @entity7 calls out @entity3 after his win over @entity95 at the @entity75 tight : @entity3 beat @entity7 by majority decision in their first meeting at the @entity99 in october 2011 i have signed @entity100 and his first outing for @entity102 will be on august 30 in @entity103 against @entity104			0
it will be a @entity106 eliminator , with the winner moving within one fight of @entity109			1
it ’s a huge bout for @entity100			0
we sold out at the box office after a few minutes			0
@entity104 is a tough , live opponent			0
he is ranked no 4 and @entity100 is no 9 , so he has a tough night ahead			0
he came to us a few weeks back wanting an opportunity and now he has it			0
although @entity117 was on the radar , this @entity106 opportunity could set up a final eliminator with @entity120 - what an enormous fight that would be			1
all roads had seemed to lead to @entity117 for @entity100 , but while that would have been a huge fight in @entity127 , this is the best way to a world title			1
for us , @entity100 opens up the markets in @entity103 and the @entity130 so fans there can expect more shows			0
on board : @entity100 has signed for @entity102 and will fight in @entity103 on august 30 on the same @entity103 bill , @entity135 will fight @entity137			1
this is a step up that i hope will get him some rounds			0
the challenge we are facing with @entity144 is that he is destroying everyone we put in front of him , regardless of their credentials			0
this fight ought to test him			2
this guy went 10 rounds before losing on points to @entity154 , a big puncher , and has only been stopped twice , once against @entity156 and once in a @entity158 title fight			1
he is tough , has fought top fighters and has stopped 14 of his 16 victims			0
this fight will give us a good comparison with @entity154 , as that ’s a fight we are looking at for the future			1
our plan is to win this fight , then fight @entity167 in @entity168 on october 11			2
then we go for a big name			0
it might be @entity171 , @entity172 or @entity173			0
my personal opinion is that he would beat any of those now			0
but this is a special talent and we are managing him correctly			0
at the moment we are taking him around the country and the crowds are just amazing			0
everyone wants to see him fight and rightly so			2
he is growing every fight			2
on the rise : @entity135 's next assignment will be against @entity137 in @entity103 domestic tussle : @entity135 could fight @entity33 heavyweight @entity154 in the future @entity190 is off due to a late injury suffered by @entity173			1
i mentioned earlier about the value of a proper grudge match			1
i ’m not sure i ever saw that in @entity172 versus @entity173			0
after months of head - to - head press conferences the fight failed to live up to expectations at the box office and never really captured the public 's imagination			1
i like @entity172 , he ’s a good guy			0
i have met him and he seems a decent fella in a sport that needs characters			0
i ’d never tell him to completely change but as a role model in the sport he often over steps the mark and loses a bit of control , hence why the @entity210 have been talking to him lately about his behaviour			0
it looked to me like sometimes he is pressured into behaving wildly in the build up to this fight to try and sell it			2
they had such a long lead up and so many head - to - heads that they always needed to say something new and exciting			2
it just did n’t feel very real and i think the punters can see through that			2
i thought that @entity172 would have won that fight and looked good in doing so			2
abandoned : @entity172 's rematch with @entity173 has been called off due to an injury the @entity228 are wonderful for amateur boxing but they are good for promoters as well			1
it ’s competitions like this and the @entity234 and world championships where promoters will have an eye on who the emerging talent is			0
at @entity102 we have always committed to young talent and i think it was a huge coup for us to get the likes of @entity135 and @entity244 , two @entity234 gold medallists , after 2012			1
going into these games , i think the two guys making the most noise are @entity249 and @entity250			1
they have had excellent amateur careers and i think they will be good pro prospects as well			0
@entity249 reminds me a bit of @entity69 in his style and work ethic – he is really good to watch			1
and @entity250 looks like one of the very best amateur talents to come out of this country			1
i ’ll be keeping an eye on them and so should you			0
glove affair : @entity249 will represent @entity263 at the @entity228 in @entity264			1

@entity266 has more hate and venom than @entity69 - @entity269
fight will be november 29 in @entity33 or november 1 in @entity77
@entity273 was not a genuine grudge match - hate did *n't* seem real
we are looking at a fight between @entity135 and @entity154
@entity249 and @entity250 on my radar at @entity228
