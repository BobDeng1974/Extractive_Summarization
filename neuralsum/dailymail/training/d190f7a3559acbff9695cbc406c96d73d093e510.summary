by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 16 september 2013 @entity1 hanged herself after suffering from panic attacks and being dismissed by a social worker a troubled student killed herself after a social worker dismissed her as ‘ an effing waste of space ’ and ‘ an attention seeker ’			1
now a coroner has formally criticised the ‘ failure ’ of the @entity12 team supposed to be caring for tragic @entity1 , 20 , who committed suicide after she spent nine days threatening to take her own life and asking to be admitted to a specialist unit			1
her frightened mother @entity16 , 43 , who made similar unsuccessful efforts to secure help for her daughter , said : ‘ if she had been admitted for treatment i believe @entity1 would still be alive			2
‘ i feel completely and utterly failed by the lack of help and care			0
' she was talked about in such a vile , horrific and derogatory way by certain people			0
' it was like being caught up in a horror film			0
’ her complaints were backed up by the evidence at the inquest into @entity1 ’s death , which heard that @entity35 doctors , police and paramedics all concluded she needed help			1
but the specialist mental health team diagnosed her as simply having ‘ attention - seeking behaviour ’			1
in a narrative verdict , @entity42 coroner @entity41 said : ‘ there was at all stages a failure to appreciate the extent of the risk that @entity1 was at in the community			1
’ @entity1 was studying @entity49 at the university of @entity42 when she began suffering mental illness for the first time			1
on an october morning last year – after she had spent nine days repeatedly asking for treatment in the city ’s @entity55 mental health unit – she was being assessed at a police station when a policeman phoned the mental health team			1
it was then that a social worker told the officer : ‘ yeah , i know her , she is an effing waste of space , she ’s an attention seeker			1
’ within three hours @entity1 was dead after strangling herself with scarves and belts			2
now her mother has told how her daughter ’s mental state swiftly degenerated into severe panic attacks and she had to be prevented from strangling herself			1
@entity72 said : ‘ it was like she was possessed but we just could n’t get the help that she needed and she wanted			0
‘ the image of finding my daughter will haunt me for ever and i can no longer sleep at night without heavy medication			0
’ yet @entity72 said that when she called the psychiatric team on her daughter ’s behalf , she was ‘ treated as if i was a pain ’			0
she added : ‘ i could hear the sighs on the phone when i told them who i was			0
’ @entity1 's mother @entity16 ( pictured right ) has said she will never recover from finding her daughter 's body and is now taking medication to deal with the trauma coroner mr @entity41 said in his verdict earlier this month : ‘ it is surely self - evident that by the end of the week it was unsafe for both @entity1 and her family for her to be at home			2
‘ one only has to pause for a moment to visualise @entity1 ’s mother and teenage brother being forced to leave the house for their own safety in the early hours of the morning and for the police to have to be called , to realise that by then a wholly impossible stage had been reached and that for however modest a period of time @entity1 required hospital admission and care			1
’ he went on to say that a ‘ safety first ’ policy had clearly not been employed , particularly in light of @entity1 ’s clearly worsening condition			2
she needed immediate help , he said , ‘ not the almost throwaway line of : well she can always come to see us when she wants to ’			0
@entity1 ’s mother said she was now taking legal action against the @entity121			2
a spokesman for the @entity121 rejected her family ’s and the coroner ’s claims that she should have been admitted to hospital , but said : ‘ in this case we deeply regret the failure to provide the right level of intensive community support which would have avoided any need for hospital admission			0
’ the social worker who made the ‘ waste of space ’ comment had been suspended while an investigation is carried out .			0
