by @entity0 meerkats are often seen as easy going , comical creatures , but in reality they hide a much darker personality			2
research into the desert creatures , which live in groups with a dominant breeding pair and many adult helpers , found the alpha female flourishes when she maintains the sole right to breed			1
this means mothers will often prevent their own daughters from breeding through the use of violence , and have been known to kill their competitors ’ offspring			1
scientists from the @entity20 studied the impact of giving contraceptive jabs to adult female helpers in 12 groups of meerkats ( stock image shown )			1
they found the alpha female flourishes when she has the sole right to breed			1
mothers will use violence to stop their daughters from breeding it may seem counterintuitive to stick people who do n’t get on in a room together and ask them to make difficult decisions , but it could produce the best results , according to research			1
conflicting views help increase the accuracy and effectiveness of decisions because they can make members of a group question why they have certain goals , and consider the goals of others			0
to study this theory , researchers looked at the behaviour and decision making processes of meerkats , but the same principles could be applied to other social animals including humans			2
the research was carried out by the @entity57 and the @entity58 in @entity59			0
it found that if multiple members in a meerkat group have different goals , when an individual makes a mistake , it has less impact on the group as a whole			2
this is because that mistake is from a faction , rather than the collective , so can be offset by another member ’s actions relatively quickly			0
they have also been known to banish other females who reproduce to ensure plentiful resources for the alpha pair 's pups			1
scientists from the @entity20 studied the impact of giving contraceptive jabs to adult female helpers in 12 groups of meerkats in the @entity85 , to ensure they could not reproduce for six months			1
during this time , dominant females were less aggressive towards helpers and foraged more			2
they also gained more weight and had bigger pups			0
the female helper meerkats experienced less violence than usual from the alpha female , and provided more care and food for the pups			1
the study proved how this way of life , also found in many animals such as ants and bees , can prove effective despite its sinister side			0
dr @entity103 of the @entity20 , @entity104 , who led the study , said : ‘ the meerkat way of life is a paradox , in which alpha females will attack their daughters , banish them from the group and infanticise their offspring			1
‘ our study reveals that dominant animals are worse off when subordinates in their group try to breed - explaining why they brutally suppress others much of the time			0
' we expected this result , but its impact exceeded our expectations			0
’ the study , published in @entity125 , was carried out by the universities of @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 with the @entity131 in @entity132			0
it was supported by the @entity134			0
in the study dominant females were less aggressive towards helpers and foraged more , gaining more weight and having bigger pups			2
it proved how this way of life , also found in many animals such as ants and bees ( stock image of @entity146 shown ) can prove effective despite its sinister side			0
