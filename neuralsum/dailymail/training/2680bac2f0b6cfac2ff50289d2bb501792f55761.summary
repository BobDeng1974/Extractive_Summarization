speculation is growing that the wife of @entity3 ’s leader @entity2 has given birth in recent weeks , continuing the family dynasty into a fourth generation			0
photographs seen on @entity3 tv show @entity9 wearing a neatly - fitting two - piece skirt suit in contrast to the loose - fitting clothing she was seen wearing in mid december and which suggested she was heavily pregnant			1
adding to the speculation that @entity9 has given birth was her recent slimmed - down appearance at an official event , which included an all - woman band singing the @entity23 @entity22 favourite @entity21			1
@entity24 : this screen grab taken from @entity26 today shows @entity3 's young leader @entity2 , right , and his wife @entity9 , left			1
the images suggest that the leader 's wife has recently given birth birth : the seemingly pregnant belly sported by @entity9 in mid-december appeared to be gone in these recent pictures before - and - after photos were run on @entity38 tv and in @entity40 newspapers today resulting in widespread agreement that @entity2 ’s wife has had a child			1
‘ the bulging stomach has gone down – has @entity9 given birth ? ’ asked one newspaper , the @entity43			1
the caption in another @entity38 paper , the @entity48 , read : ‘ @entity9 with her tummy reduced in 11 days			1
has she come out right after childbirth ? ’ the photographs have undergone the most intense scrutiny and the verdict is that @entity9 is a mother			1
a @entity38 government official , quoted by the national @entity59 news agency concluded that @entity9 ‘ appeared to have already given birth based on analysis of the tv images			2
’ whether @entity3 will officially announce what would be the equivalent of a royal birth is open to speculation			0
pregnant ? @entity9 , centre , @entity2 's wife , is pictured in december looking as though she may be expecting a child child : this picture in december of @entity9 , second left , which was taken from the side , shows her apparently bloated frame no official announcement was made that @entity2 even had a wife until state media eventually revealed it			1
but the announcement came long after pictures had emerged of a stylishly - dressed young woman accompanying the new leader at official events			2
@entity2 was elevated to leader of the secretive @entity88 state following the death of his father , @entity90 , who had succeeded his own father , ‘ @entity91 ’ @entity91			0
according to @entity38 media , citing intelligence reports , the couple were married in 2009 and already have one child			0
but that has never been confirmed			0
birth : speculation is growing that the wife of @entity3 's leader @entity2 , left , has given birth in recent weeks , continuing the family dynasty into a fourth generation			0
@entity9 is pictured right with her husband earlier this year couple : @entity3 leader @entity2 walks arm in arm with his wife @entity9 while attending a ceremony earlier this year @entity9 is said to have come from an ‘ ordinary family ’ – although her father being an academic and her mother a doctor raises them above the average level			2
the young wife of @entity3 ’s leader made her first public appearance in two months in october - bringing to an end what might have been a period of ‘ home detention ’ for being too carefree			2
@entity9 had been photographed earlier this year smiling and strolling about in a casual manner when accompanying her husband			2
but then she disappeared from view , provoking speculation that she might be pregnant but more likely because she was not presenting the dour image promoted by her husband ’s late father , @entity90			0
analysts say that despite the young @entity2 ’s appointment as supreme commander of the nation , he is still under the control of the military hierarchy who make sure he presents a rigid , authoritative image to the rest of the world			0
that means that his wife must remain aloof and untouchable in the eyes of the masses , say @entity3 experts .			0
