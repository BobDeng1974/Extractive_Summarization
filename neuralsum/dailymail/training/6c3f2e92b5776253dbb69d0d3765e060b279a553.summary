a country barman has experienced life as a millionaire after he discovered a ' loophole ' in his bank 's @entity6 system			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 in north - eastern @entity10 , lived the high life for about four and a half months in february 2011 , spending wildly on expensive escorts , private jets , exclusive restaurants and gambling			1
the 29 - year old - stumbled across a technical fault in the @entity18 's @entity6 system which meant he had access to free money whenever or wherever he wanted			1
he went on a wild spending spree paying for private jets , hookers and gambling the country barman discovered a ' loophole ' in his bank 's @entity6 system one night when he went to get some money out while drinking with friends one night he needed to withdraw cash from the atm but he just had $ 3 in his savings account , so what he did was transfer $ 200 from his credit card , and despite the screen saying ' transaction cancelled ' it worked he took home his first $ 200 before embarking on a transaction spree ' i 've never felt more alive than when i was charging on my credit card , ' mr @entity8 told @entity44 's @entity43			1
- he would transfer money from credit to his savings account while @entity6 system was ' offline ' - the atm would read ' transaction cancelled ' - but still dished out the money - he took advantage of a loophole in the system which meant the atm could n't record transactions during late - night maintenance - but still dispensed cash - the withdrawal would not register on his account - effectively giving him free cash - he continued withdrawing and the bank did n't catch up - he also tricked the atm by transferring money from his ' credit ' option to his @entity64 ... even though he only had one credit card ' with the @entity18 card i could be anyone i wanted to be , go anywhere i wanted to go , do anything as long as i had the card in my back pocket			1
i felt like a king			0
' ' i felt like a rock star , probably looked like a fat , white @entity75 , but you felt like you were @entity75 , ' he said			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity78 , he divulged how it all unfolded one night out for beers with mates and how he quickly went on a wild spending spree , with money that was not his			1
mr @entity8 had just moved to @entity9 in country @entity10 and one evening in february , 2011 he was out drinking with friends			2
like most people he needed to withdraw cash from the @entity6 , but when he tried , he realised he just had $ 3 in his savings account , so what he did was transfer $ 200 from his credit card			2
' it said transaction cancelled but it worked , ' he said			0
$ 200 richer , mr @entity8 happily went back to the pub to continue drinking with his friends			2
@entity8 ( pictured ) went on a wild spending spree on his discovery and told his new friends he was a poker player , sometimes a surgeon or an investment banker from the humble life as a barman in @entity9 , in country @entity10 , @entity8 ( pictured right ) reached millionaire status and lived life to max from a technical fault in his banks @entity6 system the barman who made a mere $ 700 a week could n't believed his luck when he stumbled apon the technical fault in the banking system but it was n't until later that night that the barman , who earned a mere $ 700 a week , decided to try his luck again			1
he tried to check his account balance at another atm but it was just registering ' balance unavailable ' so he again transferred $ 200 and it worked before he pushed his withdrawals out to $ 2000 , the limit of his credit card and went home			2
because atm are known to go offline at certain times , where people can transfer funds but not get a balance for their account , the money he was withdrawing was not registering			0
he did n't stop there and within a couple of weeks , @entity8 had transferred $ 20,000			2
with his new found riches , rumours started to make their way around the small town and when he began punting heavily with a mate while at work one night at the pub , his luck turned			0
' turns out that we turned over more than the @entity138 would turn over in three weeks in one night so that alerted the @entity138 to the fact that we 'd done that , ' he told @entity78			0
' i told them it was friend taking the bets but they did n't want to take that on board and they got the publican to fire me as a result			0
' to make matters worse , rumours made their way to his girlfriend , that he was spending money all over town and she then dumped him via text message			0
why not ? ! @entity8 ( pictured ) splurged on a number of expensive items when money started rolling in from the @entity6 within a couple of months of withdrawing money from the @entity6 , because of a ' loophole ' he had already stolen from @entity18 about $ 1.6 million on his credit card mr @entity8 ( pictured ) who talked exclusively to @entity78 said he ' felt like a king ' after conning money out of @entity18 's banking system but instead of wallowing in his losses , he decided to go back to @entity175 , get some advice from friends and kept his bank balance , rather healthy			1
' on one hand you 've lost your girlfriend , lost your job , but on the other hand , hey , you 've got unlimited funds			0
let 's smash it up for a bit let 's sort things out , ' he said			0
while he believed it was a luxury that would be short lived , mr @entity8 kept withdrawing more and more money every day and there his lifestyle as a country barman dramatically transformed into that of a millionaire			1
he created many different alias ' to new friends , including being a poker player , a surgeon and even an investment banker , living the dream of a high roller			0
he then discovered another way to trick the atm and double his money , transferring money from the @entity6 's ' credit ' account option to his @entity64 , even though he only had one credit card			2
@entity8 ( pictured ) conned @entity18 bank out of thousands , then evevtually reaching $ 1.6 million through an @entity6 flaw at first he thought it was a mistake but tried his luck again and realised he could beat the system and withdraw as much money as possible whenever and wherever he wanted in may that year , @entity8 was believed to have already stolen $ 1.6 million of the banks money on his credit card			1
but like anyone who is cheating the system , @entity8 soon started felling guilty about his adventures and began to see a psychologist			2
it was in june , four and a half months after making his costly discovery , that he stopped making continuous transfers			1
he told @entity78 he then called the bank , who told him it was under police investigation and they would n't talk to him			0
' it was never about the actual money it was just about the journey			0
' three and a half years later and mr @entity8 had still got off scot free for his dealing with @entity6 's , still blazay about funding his lavish lifestyle with money that was n't his own			1
' i 've overdrawn my own accounts if that makes me a crook that makes me a crook , ' he said			0
it was n't until just last week that police issued a warrant for his arrest and continue to look for mr @entity8 , who is now suddenly missing in action			1
after four and a half months of solid spending @entity8 ( pictured ) said guilt got the better of him and he rang the bank , but they said police were investigating and they would n't talk to him finally after three and a half years of not being caught for his wild spendings have police issued a warrant for his arrest			1
