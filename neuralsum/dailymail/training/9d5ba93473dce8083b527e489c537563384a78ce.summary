alleged culprit : @entity1 is believed to be one of the two people behind the faked reports of offensive and racist graffiti on @entity7 's campus a string of offensive graffiti messages were made by a transgender student who was a member of a campus group that dealt bias incidents , according to @entity7 officials			1
one of the two known culprits was revealed as @entity1 , a transgender student in charge of the @entity17 , and officials said that the offending pair were the ones behind some of the graffiti			2
the school 's director of media relations told @entity26 that they have only been able to pinpoint two of the six incidents to the pair , and the investigation into the other incidents is ongoing			1
the pair are being held responsible to creating those two graffiti and then reporting the offensive messages to college authorities , pretending like they were not involved in their creation			2
some of the messages - though it is unclear whether they were the ones attributed to the guilty pair or not - included offensive sentiments such as ' @entity43			1
@entity44 ' and ' @entity45 '			0
another message found on a student 's door was ' f * * * n * * * * * ' , showing that gender identity was not the only bias issue being addressed by the culprit			2
@entity7 sent out an email to students on november 14 telling them that the school 's @entity17 had been told of at least six different messages that were spray painted on dorm room doors across campus			1
disturbing the peace : @entity7 , in @entity61 , became concerned when six alleged instances of bias graffiti were reported , only to learn later that they were staged by the group reporting them adding up : the school did not formally name @entity1 as one of the individuals behind the scheme , but the transgender student dropped out of school and left his prominent positions in student government the same day the student - led group was designed to formulate the reports and provide support for the victims			1
@entity79 , @entity7 director of media relations , told @entity26 the the @entity17 is ' a group that gathers and discusses incidents and how the college addresses bias			0
' the @entity84 reports that five days after the initial email was sent , the school president had to send out another saying that the bias incidents were perpetrated by two students , one of whom was a leader of @entity17 and actively involved in student government			1
' it is our unfortunate duty to report that two @entity7 students have admitted responsibility for creating a number of recent bias and hate - speech messages in public spaces on campus , ' @entity7 president @entity92 wrote in the email			1
' they also falsely reported these as anonymous messages			0
sadly , our community has been deeply hurt by these actions			0
' neither of the students ' names were listed in the email and it said that they both had left the school voluntarily			0
connected : @entity1 , a junior at the school , was a member of the @entity17 and allegedly made up the reports of graffiti disparaging @entity115 and transgender students ' @entity122 showed that two students who were responsible for some of the incidents but ... we do not know if they were responsible for all of them , ' mr @entity79 said			1
he said that criminal charges against the pair are ' not in our plans at this time '			0
one of the individuals involved remains a mystery , but because of the others involvement in campus groups , the second has since been reported to be @entity1			0
@entity1 was a junior at the school and the vice president of student affairs of the @entity134 , which acts as the student government			0
he was a leader in a number of gay and lesbian support groups on campus and is featured in a video , uploaded to @entity140 by @entity7 , at an equality rally			0
while the school 's only formal statement on about the suspects was the initial email where they were not named , another clue about @entity1 's involvement came when the president of the @entity7 's student government sent out an email announcing the vacated position of vice president .			2

messages included offensive *threats* at transgender students and @entity115
*claims* were investigated by student - led group and school officials later realized that one of the group leaders was behind the graffiti
both of the students involved have left the school
