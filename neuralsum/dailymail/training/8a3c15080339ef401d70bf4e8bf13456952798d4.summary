a demolition company has decided that the best way to tear down buildings is one brick at a time - even when that building is a 45 metre high chimney			1
the firm , which knocks down buildings in the city of @entity9 in north @entity10 , believes - so long as you are not in a rush - it is more economical to have a single man hammering out the bricks one by one than it is to shell out for explosives			1
@entity19 boss @entity18 explained that he is able to offer the firm 's demolition services at a knock - down price as his methods are so cheap			1
the @entity10 demolition company believes that - so long as you 're not in a rush - it is more economical to have a single man hammering out the brinks one by one than it is to shell out for explosives he said : ' if you are looking at demolishing anything here you need to spend a fortune for the explosives and the license to use them , as well as demolition experts and all sorts of insurances against making any mistakes			2
' in contrast you can also do it with one man and a hammer , it takes longer , but if there is no rush then you save a fortune			0
@entity18 says that he has a dozen workers knocking down buildings across the city in @entity51 and business is booming			0
the chimneys were no longer in use and needed to be removed , but the other buildings around still in use could not be damaged			0
so @entity18 's firm demolished them carefully and slowly he added : ' in the latest job the staff tackled a stack of 45 metre high chimneys was able to offer a knockdown price compared to other demolition firms that offer to do it with explosives			1
' the chimneys were no longer in use and needed to be removed , but the other buildings around still in use could not be damaged			0
' for an explosives expert that 's a specialist job and it means a lot of money , for me i just need to get another couple of lads and had them a hammer and a rope , and come back in a month to collect the cash			2

the firm , which demolishes buildings in @entity9 , says business is booming
@entity19 boss explained he saves money on explosives by using *manpower*
this means he can offer services at cut prices - so long as there is no rush
his latest *project* involved *dismantling* 45 - metre chimneys with a hammer
