a gesture - controlled system claims to be the solution to making smart homes commonplace - even if the devices in your house are n't that smart			1
called onecue , the system lets you control your tv , room temperature , lights , blinds and more with the swipe of a hand			1
but while it syncs with smart technology like @entity17 and @entity18 , it can also let you control standard pieces of technology like televisions and set - top boxes			1
called onecue it can sync with existing smart devices like @entity17 , but it can also be used to control infrared devices like standard tvs			1
gestures include closing the palm of your hand to ' air click ' and change a tv channel developed by @entity25 - based company @entity40 , onecue can sync up with many existing smart devices in your home			1
for now these include @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity18 , but more are promised in future			0
@entity49 ( @entity49 ) controlled devices such as tvs , cable and satellite boxes , dvd players and games consoles are supported by onecue			2
similar to a universal remote , onecue can ‘ learn ’ to control most @entity49 remote - controlled devices			1
for instance , ir - controlled blinds , power switches or power outlets can be controlled with gestures			0
it also supports @entity65 controlled devices such as the @entity17 and @entity18 light bulbs			2
for best results , the user should face onecue and position themselves within the camera ’s line of sight			0
the ideal distance for interaction is between four and 16ft ( 1.2 and 4.9 metres )			0
once a gesture is detected , onecue communicates with configured devices , and it communicates directly with @entity49 - controlled devices that are in the same room and in the line of sight			2
and , it can also control @entity65 and infrared - enabled devices such as standard tvs , set - top boxes , games consoles and more			1
the device looks similar to @entity88 's @entity87 and works best when it is in the line of sight of the user , so the company suggests using it on a flat surface like a tv			0
using hand tracking and gesture recognition technology , it then translates motions into wireless commands			0
for example , closing and reopening a palm in the air - dubbed an ‘ air click ' - selects a channel on the tv			1
placing a finger to a user 's lips mutes the system , while moving a hand up and down can open or close @entity49 - controlled blinds			2
an lcd display on the front of onecue shows what devices are currently available , and what controls are available			0
actions can also be pre-programmed , such as having it turn on multiple devices at once with the wave of a hand			0
and the device does n’t need a tv to operate , as the lcd display can provide adequate information on the devices being operated			2
the device ( shown ) has an adjustable stand , so it can be used on a variety of flat surfaces			0
for best results , the user should face onecue and position themselves within the camera ’s line of sight			0
the ideal distance for interaction is between four and 16ft ( 1.2 and 4.9 metres )			0
the £ 125 ( $ 199 ) device will go on sale in early 2015 the onecue device looks somewhat similar to @entity88 's @entity87 ( shown ) and also , like the device for @entity141 , uses gestures as a means of control ‘ every device in our homes , from the tv to the games console to the thermostat , has its own control system and remotes , cables or apps for operation , resulting in lots of clutter and fragmentation , ’ said @entity145 , boss of @entity40			1
‘ to solve this problem , we developed onecue , a control centre to bring together all of these devices through a natural , easy - to - use interface that leverages our years of experience in gesture recognition technology to let you experience your home through your fingertips			1
’ and he added that ‘ onecue is enabling the @entity171 right in your home by connecting your devices and making them smarter and easier to use			2
