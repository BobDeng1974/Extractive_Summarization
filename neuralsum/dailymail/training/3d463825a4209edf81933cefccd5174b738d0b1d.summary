a senior @entity1 official told a @entity3 and @entity4 subcommittee on thursday that several agencies including the @entity6 are investigating partisan political activity inside the @entity8 , and that former official @entity10 's disappearing emails are on the menu			1
a criminal investigation , deputy attorney general @entity12 testified , ' is being conducted by career attorneys and agents of the @entity1 ’s @entity16 , the @entity6 , and the @entity17			1
@entity12 declined to provide lawmakers with details about what the @entity1 has uncovered			2
' i can , however , tell you , ' he added , ' that the investigation includes investigating the circumstances of the lost emails from @entity27 ’s computer			0
' @entity10 , who led the @entity8 division tasked with vetting and monitoring tax - exempt nonprofits until her retirement late last year , is @entity34 ' central bête noire in the controversy over how her sub-agency targeted conservative groups with aggressive scrutiny and years - long delays when they applied for the coveted charitable status			1
@entity54 drew gasps during a congressional hearing when he acknowledged that after forensic experts failed to retrieve the emails , the agency recycled the drive – rendering it permanently unavailable to investigators in the legislative branch of government			0
he also admitted , under questioning by @entity70 rep. @entity69 , that the @entity8 failed to look at a backup tape that could have provided copies of @entity10 's emails for a six - month period			1
@entity12 's statement on thursday is the first indication that the @entity78 administration may have moved with purpose to probe what happened , despite the @entity34 's hints at a partisan slow - walk – or , worse , a cover - up in which @entity10 herself destroyed evidence of her alleged wrongdoing			1
@entity10 's attorney , @entity87 , did not respond to an email seeking comment			1
on july 9 he released a statement claiming that his client ' did not destroy any records subject to the @entity93 , she did not cause the computer assigned to her to fail , and she made every effort to recover the files on the computer			0
' although @entity34 learned of the email losses in june , her hard drive crashed in 2011			1
some @entity34 believe the data loss as happened at too opportune a time to have been an accident : just days earlier , the @entity34 had begun publicly questioning the @entity8 's partisan activity			2
that was two years before @entity10 herself outed the program by answering a planted question at a conference for tax professionals in may 2013			0
her admission presaged a report , long in the making , that the @entity17 released days later			0
that same year , a surviving email shows , @entity10 cautioned her colleagues and underlings to communicate via instant message instead of by email , because the latter would be open to congressional inquiries			0
@entity120 @entity119 rep. @entity119 reacted to @entity12 's written testimony late on wednesday , telling @entity122 that it was overdue			0
' finally , someone in the administration admits that the destruction of two years of emails from @entity10 is fishy , ' @entity119 said			2
clash : @entity34 rep. @entity128 ( r ) has continually crossed swords with democrat @entity130 ( @entity131 ) over the question of whether @entity10 can claim @entity134 privileges and refuse to testify about her agency 's partisan activities like other @entity34 , @entity119 wants the @entity1 to appoint a special prosecutor instead of relying on its own lawyers to conduct the investigation			1
that seems unlikely , as @entity12 's appearance at thursday 's hearing appears calculated in part to quell conservatives ' fears about the @entity1 's impartiality			1
' this whole thing is about @entity150 in power abusing republicans , ' a senior staffer to an @entity43 @entity34 member told @entity153 on thursday morning			2
' why would we trust that another agency in the same administration will behave any better ? ' @entity10 raised the @entity34 's temperature at a may 2013 committee hearing when she offered a self - serving opening statement before refusing to answer questions , citing her @entity134 right against self - incrimination			2
attorneys working for the committee 's @entity34 majority later determined that she had waived that right by offering an oral defense that was n't subject to cross-examination			0
@entity34 have since pushed a contempt of @entity169 resolution through the @entity170 , citing her refusal to answer questions while under subpoena			0
one conservative member , @entity174 of @entity175 , proposed last week that the @entity170 sergeant - at - arms should arrest her .			0

deputy attorney general testifies that the @entity1 is looking into the 2011 disappearance of years of @entity10 's emails following a hard drive crash
@entity34 believe the emails would show the former @entity8 official 's leading role in a *scheme* to target conservative nonprofit groups
