a married couple who each follow different religions came up with an unusual approach to raising their children - bringing up each of them in a separate faith			2
@entity7 , a devout @entity8 , and her husband @entity9 , who is @entity10 , decided to split their family down the middle when it came to religion			1
@entity7 took charge of her daughter , @entity17 , 24 ; while @entity9 took the reins teaching @entity19 , 21 , as they grew up in @entity20 , @entity21			1
unusual set - up : @entity19 and @entity23 , above , were raised in separate faiths - @entity25 and @entity26 @entity17 had a confirmation , attended weekly @entity8 instruction and remains a committed @entity29 to this day			1
meanwhile @entity19 was circumcised when he was eight days old , and was given religious lessons in an orthodox hebrew school , @entity30 reported			1
while @entity17 remains @entity29 today , @entity19 is now agnostic			1
because his mother was not @entity10 , his father was also unable to arrange a bar mitzvah for him , and admits he was less strict keeping up his religious education than @entity7 was with @entity17			1
@entity7 revealed that their approach baffled many close to them			2
she said : ' i know people have looked at us like we were nuts			0
together : @entity7 and @entity43 , above with their children in a 2010 photograph , made the decision even though it baffles many ' i did n’t really want to tell either one of our families for a long time what we were planning			2
we kept mum about it to most people but if we did tell friends , they all said we were crazy			0
' nonetheless , the @entity7 clan think their unorthodox arrangement has its advantages			1
@entity17 said : ' i do n’t know anybody else who did what my parents specifically did , but it was just never strange for me			2
' ... we ’d go to the @entity10 side of my family [ on jewish holidays ] and i definitely find comfort in @entity10 traditions because i grew up with them , but there ’s always been a “ that ’s not my religion " thing			1
' she concluded : ' for me , this was just normal			0
it was n’t something that ever struck me as odd			0
and my parents were very good about it			0
there was never any pressure from them			0
it was really just normal for us			0
i think it made sense for them so we went with it			0

@entity7 is a @entity8 and her husband , @entity9 , is @entity10
pair from @entity20 , @entity21 , decided to raise kids in different faiths
@entity17 , now 24 , received @entity8 religious instruction and was confirmed
@entity19 , 21 , had @entity10 teaching - but was *ultimately* not given a bar mitzvah
family say many find arrangement baffling - but have *defended* it
