incredible journey : @entity1 , ceo of @entity4 bioinformatics firm @entity2 , started life fleeing squalor in @entity7 for a new life in @entity9 boarding a tugboat in search of a new life , four - year - old @entity1 's mother was clutching one precious possession : a vial of poison			1
in the highly possible circumstance of a pirate boarding the vessel , she would feed it to her two daughters and her mother , before taking it herself			2
it was a precaution so many had taken before her as they fled squalor in @entity7 for hope in @entity9			1
little did they know , as the family huddled together crashing over the @entity33 , that one of the little girls would become one of the science world 's most successful ceos with a home in @entity4			1
@entity1 is the founder and chief executive of @entity2 , a bioinformatics company that studies the brain and teaches computers to think for themselves			1
it is a world , a life , a career she could not have imagined growing up as an @entity47 outcast in @entity48 , a working - class suburb of @entity49			1
speaking to family history enthusiasts at the @entity52 conference in @entity53 on thursday , @entity1 described her ascension from life as an immigrant with nothing - and taunts of ' slit - eye ' ; graffiti screaming ' go home @entity47 '			1
she told the @entity62 her success is thanks to ' humility with daring ' - traits she accrued growing up			1
the journey , both physical and psychological , that she went through with her mother , grandmother , and younger sister gave her the strength and confidence to push boundaries			2
describing the start of that journey , aboard the boat , she told a @entity78 conference : ' i do n't remember the pirates who came many times , but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours			1
' but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the @entity90 coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey 's end too much for him , and the first apple i tasted , given to me by the men on the rig			2
no apple has ever tasted the same			2
just a couple of years later she was named ' @entity106			0
' to get there she obtained grants and scholarships			0
it sent her into a parallel world			0
' in one , ' she said , ' i was the classic @entity47 student , relentless in the demands that i made on myself			0
in the other , i was enmeshed in lives that were precarious , tragically scarred by violence , drug abuse and isolation			0
' when she was invited to speak about social activism , @entity1 was more than capable , but petrified			1
' i did n't know the protocols			0
i did n't know how to use the cutlery			0
i did n't know how to talk about wine			0
i did n't know how to talk about anything			0
i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb			1
' i told my mother i could n't do it			2
she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat			0
@entity134 had never been an option			0
" just do it , " she said , " and do n't be what you 're not			0
" ' groundbreaking : @entity1 's firm is analyzing brain activity and applying the findings to technology			1
