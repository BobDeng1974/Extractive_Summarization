he has been the spitting image of @entity1 for more than decade - with his bouffant hairdo , large glasses and olive green suit			1
and while he got plenty of abuse in the street from the misguided few who really thought he was the @entity11 dictator , @entity6 @entity5 was never short of work as his double			1
but now it looks like the good times are over and southern @entity1 will have to hang up his wide - waisted trousers for good following the death of northern kim			2
' people try to comfort me , saying some figures are more famous when they 're dead , but i do n't think it will be the case with @entity1 , ' said the engraver			1
but he added wistfully : ' i feel very empty , as if a part of me died			1
he said : ' one day after i got out of the shower and my hair was very curly , people told me i looked like @entity1			1
' when then - @entity6 president @entity37 began the @entity38 of reconciliation with the @entity11 in the late 1990s he started to be noticed and was invited to appear on television			0
in mourning : the father - of - two , who has moonlighted as his look - a - like for more than a decade , said he felt a part of him had died who 's who : @entity5 ( left ) is the spitting image of @entity11 's departed leader @entity1 ( right ) since then he has enjoyed an illustrious career appearing on @entity50 tv , in a @entity52 chocolate commercial , and in 1995 @entity6 film @entity54			1
@entity11 's military has pledged to keep up its aggressive stance towards the west under the country 's new leader , @entity58			1
top generals from the secretive state said today they would refuse to work with @entity6 's president @entity62 , whom they described as a ' traitor '			2
the belligerent message came after @entity58 was declared ' great leader ' for the first time following the death of his father @entity1 last week			1
@entity11 's powerful @entity70 said the country would never deal with mr @entity62 , a conservative who stopped a no - strings - attached aid policy toward the @entity11 in 2008 , and that it was ' uniting around @entity58 comrade @entity58 '			2
the movie was about a @entity6 scientist who secretly helped the @entity11 develop nuclear weapons to prevent a @entity50 invasion			0
it led to him rubbing shoulders with celebrities and world leaders - or at least people who look like them - including @entity86 and @entity88 impersonators			0
but the highs of portraying a man who presided over a deadly famine and tested a nuclear bomb have not been without the lows , and he regularly receives abuse walking down the street			0
he said : ' some people curse at me and call me ' dictator ' , but those who know me wave and shout ' @entity1 ! '			1
then i would wave back at them and show them some of @entity1 's moves			1
' it is also tough work keeping up @entity1 's appearance			1
he perms his hair every three months and before his death closely followed changes in his look and demeanour			0
he even went on a diet when the late leader lost weight following a 2008 stroke			0
abused : @entity5 regularly receives heckles from passersby who think he is the @entity11 leader commemorative : postage stamps have been released in honour of @entity1			1
on the left he appears with his son @entity58 with ' the great leader comrade @entity1 will always be with us ' above and ( right ) he appears alone with the text ' the great leader comrade @entity1 will live forever ' he added : ' back when @entity1 was young , i used to use hairspray , but after he got old and started to lose hair , i did n't have to do anything			1
' he has four different suits made in the style of the late ruler along with five pairs of platform shoes			0
he added : ' before , i used to wear the outfits almost everyday , but now i just wear them once in a while and when i 'm invited to be @entity1 at an event			2
it 's a shame i wo n't be able to wear them anymore			0
' since @entity1 died on december 17 , he fears his career is almost over			1
he also regrets never having met his inspiration or even visiting @entity11			0
he added : ' @entity1 was a great man in a way because although he was a dictator , he built a country like no other			2
do you think anyone could do it ? ' now , as @entity1 's youngest son @entity58 inherits the world 's last communist dynasty , the late leader 's double thinks it is time to step aside for a new generation			1
he said : ' i 'd like to do more acting as @entity1 , but they 'll find someone new for @entity58			2
they asked if my son looked like him but he does n't or i would have sent him to an audition			0
' @entity164 - eyed observers of how @entity11 's media covered @entity1 's funeral believe they have been up to their old tricks - with a spot of @entity169			2
a seemingly doctored photograph has emerged of a soldier , who appears to be well over 8ft tall , in the back row of one block of mourners			0
the image was captured as the funeral procession passed near the @entity177 in the capital @entity179			0
in the crowd : the giant soldier , circled , is barely visible amongst the blocks of mourners standing out : but then , on closer inspection , he can clearly be seen towering above his colleagues official news agency @entity187 took the photo , and the giant soldier appears to show him from several different angles			0
some believe it could be 7ft 8in tall @entity11 basketball star @entity193			0
it follows yesterday 's emergence of evidence showing how the scores of wailing mourners were not the only well - choreographed aspect at the memorial service			0
two comparison photos ( below ) showed how a camera crew filming the sombre ceremony were apparently erased from history after being digitally removed from the picture .			0

engraver @entity5 impersonated @entity1 for 10 years
