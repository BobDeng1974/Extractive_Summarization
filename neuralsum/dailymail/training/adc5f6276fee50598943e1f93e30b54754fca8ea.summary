after the blow of finally losing mr @entity8 having previously backed him to stay , the prime minister was said to have allowed ' this dog of a coalition government ' to look incompetent			1
lord @entity4 's criticism came amid reports that mr @entity8 decided to quit after younger @entity5 mps from the 2010 intake made clear their hostility when parliament returned this week			1
@entity4 ( left ) , a cabinet minister from @entity23 's leadership , has criticised the prime minister ( right ) for allowing the coalition to look incompetent and be called ' a government of unfeeling toffs ' writing in @entity29 , @entity4 - a cabinet minister in @entity23 's government - said : ' this dog of a coalition government has let itself be given a bad name and now anybody can beat it			1
' it has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs			1
past governments have had far more real @entity5 toffs : prime ministers @entity37 and @entity39 , or even in @entity23 's day , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and plenty more , without incurring similar abuse			2
' he added : ' the abiding sin of the government is not that some ministers are rich , but that it seems unable to manage its affairs competently			0
' mr @entity8 finally fell on his sword after admitting that the row over his confrontation with @entity60 police made his position untenable			1
after weeks of criticism and speculation over his future , mr @entity8 said it was not fair to put his colleagues and family through such ' damaging ' stories any longer			1
resignation : @entity8 quit as @entity2 's chief whip exactly a month after losing his temper with police officers for stopping him ride his bicycle out of @entity60 he insisted in a letter to the prime minister that he had not referred to an officer on the gate in @entity60 as either a ' pleb ' or a ' moron ' but acknowledged delivering , after being told he could not ride his bike through the main gates , the parting line : ' i thought you guys were supposed to f * * * * * * help us			1
' he was swiftly replaced as chief whip by sir @entity88			1
mps from across the party have called on @entity2 and chancellor @entity91 to shake up ' the government machine ' , claiming that too many members of the @entity60 inner circle were ' teenagers ' from privileged public school backgrounds with no knowledge of business or executive control			1
criticisms voiced yesterday focused on @entity2 's closest advisers , including @entity102 , his old @entity104 chief of staff , as well as the @entity60 communications team			1
they claimed the quality - control mechanism in @entity60 was broken , failing to spot potential difficulties and aid @entity2 to make the right decisions			2
many mps blamed @entity2 for letting the @entity8 crisis drag on for a month			1
a @entity5 mp told @entity114 : ' i feel very strongly that accusations of being out of touch is so right			0
we need to look at the sort of people who are forming policies - these are not the people who go to @entity124 's regularly , or understand the cost of childcare			0
they have n't got a clue			0
it does n't help that @entity2 and @entity91 are both privileged public school boys			2
' @entity131 , a senior member of the treasury select committee , told the newspaper no 10 needed to ' tighten up the machine ' and change personnel			0
he said : ' there have been unforced errors made			0
we can look at the budget , we can look at the rail network			0
in every case it has been ministers culpable			0
' this disgruntlement on the back benches is not just about this @entity8 resignation			2
i would expect the prime minister to shore up the government machine			1
' the alliance of @entity5 mps making up about half of the party which decided mr @entity8 's fate has been dubbed the ' battle of the tea room '			1
witnesses to the unsettled scenes in the @entity159 tea room and the @entity161 meeting last week said the majority of the 148 mps elected to @entity164 two years ago had ' signed his death warrant ' by relinquishing support for the chief whip			2
according to @entity169 , one mp recalled ' they hit as a pack ' , while another said mr @entity8 ' was trying to be charming but was given the cold shoulder '			2
' there was blood on the carpet ' , said another mp , as @entity5 deputy chief whip @entity176 told @entity163 that mr @entity8 had damaged the interests of the party and threatened to resign if the chief whip did not			1
the mp added : ' it was clear then he would n't last the week			0
' at a union rally in @entity185 today , @entity183 leader @entity182 said the government remained on the wrong path despite mr @entity8 's resignation			1

according to a @entity197 poll , @entity182 's @entity183 has increased its lead to 13 points on 43 per cent , with @entity201 's @entity200 scoring eight points , four points below the anti-eu @entity205 party			2
more than one in two voters said @entity8 should resign as an mp as well as give up his @entity209 seat			0
of those polled by @entity211 , one in four people who voted @entity5 at the last election said the conduct of conservative ministers such as mr @entity8 made them less likely to vote @entity5 next time round			2
the poll was conducted in the immediate aftermath of mr @entity8 's resignation on friday and controversy over chancellor @entity91 travelling in a first - class rail carriage with a standard - class ticket			1
' @entity8 may finally have resigned , but the culture of two nations runs right across this government			2
' they cut taxes for millionaires , and raise taxes for ordinary families			0
they leave young people out of work while the bonuses at the banks carry on			0
' they even have a chancellor of the exchequer who tries to travel first class on a standard class ticket			0
' it 's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everybody else : everybody like you who plays their part and does the right thing			0
' in spite of @entity5 support plummeting to 30 per cent according to a @entity197 poll , education secretary @entity250 insisted that the difficult stories from the past week would not influence voters			0
in the @entity211 poll , one in four people who voted @entity5 at the last election said the conduct of conservative ministers such as mr @entity8 had made them less likely to vote @entity5 again at the next election			2
mr @entity250 told @entity263 : ' it 's always the case that there are weeks when the headlines are populated by stories that are of interest to the @entity164 village and contain an element of human drama , but which for most people are just part of the froth of political life and not central to the concerns which will determine how they vote or how they live their lives			0
' the prime minister , having made his decision , having recognised that @entity8 had done an outstanding job as international development secretary , felt that he could continue to do a very good job as chief whip and bring to the party some of the knowledge and skill he had deployed in a different ministerial role			1
' in his resignation letter to the prime minister , mr @entity8 said : ' i have made clear to you - and i give you my categorical assurance again - that i did not , never have , and never would call a police officer a ' pleb ' or a ' moron ' or used any of the other pejorative descriptions attributed to me			1
' the offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark ' i thought you guys were supposed to f * * * * * * help us '			0
' it was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and i am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology			0
' accepting his resignation , mr @entity2 said he was ' sorry ' to receive mr @entity8 's letter but added : ' i understand why you have reached the conclusion that you have , and why you have decided to resign from the government			1
' i regret that this has become necessary , and am very grateful for all you have done , both in @entity315 and in @entity318 - as well as for the kind words in your letter			0

lord @entity4 : ' it has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs ' .
criticisms follow @entity8 's resignation as @entity2 's chief whip and replacement by sir @entity88
@entity182 : ' it 's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everybody else '
prime minister , who said he was ' sorry ' to lose mr @entity8 , is facing calls from his mps to sack privileged and ' out of touch ' @entity60 aides
