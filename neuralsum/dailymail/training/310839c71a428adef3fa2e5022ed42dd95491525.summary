by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 14 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:00 est , 14 december 2013 to anyone under the age of 40 , @entity3 is instantly recognisable as one half of the @entity7 , children ’s tv favourites from 1987 onwards			1
with @entity3 playing straight man to his hapless older brother @entity12 , the pair made an impressive 21 series of their hit @entity14 show @entity16 , famous for its slapstick humour and catchphrases such as ‘ to me , to you ’			2
they filmed their last series in 2009 , making it the longest running sitcom after @entity25			2
regular at this pub : chuckle brother @entity7 in the bar at his home ' @entity29 ' in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 with their success came all the trappings , and @entity3 ’s five - bedroom gated home , @entity38 – with its well - stocked bar room , snooker room and grounds of one - and - a - half acres – is testimony to this			1
set in the pleasant village of @entity30 in @entity32 , @entity45 is a 15 - minute drive from @entity31 and not far from @entity48 , where @entity3 and @entity12 grew up in a council house with their two older brothers and their parents – mum @entity52 and father @entity53 , a gang show performer			1
however , you could say that @entity3 has become a victim of his own success			2
the palatial house , set down a private road , has been on the market for nearly two years			0
despite reducing the asking price by £ 150,000 to £ 550,000 , he has yet to find a buyer			1
‘ we ’ve had only four or five viewings in all that time , ’ says @entity3 , who believes the house may be just too expensive for local buyers			0
‘ the average house price around here is in the region of £ 95,000 ; we ’re charging more than five times that			1
’ hard sell : mr @entity7 has been forced to lower the price for the home with £ 150,000 to £ 550,000 as he struggles to find a buyer in frustration , he has just changed estate agents			1
according to @entity76 , director at @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity3 ’s new agents , it has been a tough few years for prices in the region			0
he explains that prices have yet to recover to pre- 2008 levels but things are starting to look up			0
‘ last month was cracking , our best in four years , ’ he says , ‘ but there are few buyers in @entity3 ’s price range and because it ’s such a unique property , it has to find its own level			0
’ @entity3 ’s material possessions have been hard won			0
this is the @entity7 ’ 50th year as a double act – they found fame after winning the tv talent show @entity97 in 1974 – and the pair have just embarked on their 46th panto run , in @entity101			1
although both in their late 60s , the brothers show no sign of slowing down and spend their time travelling around the country for personal appearances at everything from pub quizzes to corporate team - building events , as well as touring with their own show			2
‘ i ca n’t imagine retiring because it ’s such good fun , ’ says @entity3			0
chuckling away : the five - bedroom home also has a snooker table and an en - suite master bedroom he admits the panto season – two performances a day , six days a week until february – is pretty exhausting			1
‘ it ’s not an easy life but it ’s better than going down the pit , ’ says @entity3 , whose first job was working in a @entity121 steelworks			0
@entity3 and wife @entity126 , 56 , bought @entity45 for £ 300,000 in 2002 and have spent about £ 50,000 extending it , adding a master bedroom suite with bathroom and dressing room			1
now that their youngest two sons are in their early 20s , they are keen to downsize and plan to spend much of the year at their @entity134 farmhouse			0
despite struggling to sell his current home , @entity3 still thinks property is a good place to invest his money			2
‘ obviously i ’m not happy about having to reduce the price but we will still have made money on the house if we sell for the new asking price			0
’ the couple decided to invest in other properties soon after moving to @entity38			0
they built a five - bedroom villa with pool on the @entity150 island of @entity151 , which they rent to holidaymakers , and own a two - bedroom apartment on the island , where they themselves holiday			1
they have also bought a two - bed apartment in @entity160 , @entity161 , which they visit twice a year			2
