@entity0 took a swipe at @entity2 the day after his @entity4 heartache by insisting the heir to his throne did n't deserve to win the @entity8 award			1
@entity2 was welcomed home by @entity11 president @entity10 , who admitted she ' did n't see a single match ' , after @entity14 's 1 - 0 win at the @entity15 in @entity16 on sunday			1
and the four - time @entity8 winner , who looked almost apologetic to be named player of the tournament , only won the award because of a ' marketing plan ' , says @entity0			1
@entity52 ( @entity14 ) - again a standout at a major tournament , he found the net on five occasions and was a constant threat for the eventual winners			2
@entity59 ( @entity11 ) - different class in the middle of midfield as he took each game , particularly in the knockout stages , by the scruff of the neck and roared the @entity67 on			2
completed the most tackles of anyone at the @entity4			0
@entity70 ( @entity14 ) - @entity71 , beware			0
this man is the very definition of a sweeper - keeper			0
barely put a foot wrong all tournament with a string of top saves and bossed his area like no other			0
@entity82 ( @entity87 ) - although there were simulation antics , @entity82 's poise in possession and potency in front of goal were deciding factors in @entity92 's team finishing third			1
' i would give him any award , but when it 's not fair and when marketing people make him win something that he did n't win , it 's unfair , ' said @entity0			1
' because ( @entity82 ) @entity82 played an exceptional tournament and because @entity52 made an incredible sacrifice against @entity11			1
' i feel sorry for my country			0
@entity40 ’s goal really hurt			0
there ’s a huge sadness in my heart that we lost the final			0
' all things put together , i think @entity11 deserved at least penalties			0
that @entity14 won was the result of a misunderstanding in the @entity25 defence			0
' @entity0 added on his television show , @entity115 : ' i could see he did n't want to go up and collect it			0
' @entity2 won the @entity8 ahead of a number of arguably more worthy candidates			1
@entity45 's @entity44 , @entity14 's @entity52 and @entity70 , @entity11 's @entity59 and @entity87 's @entity82 all had cases to make			1
it mattered little in the end , though , as @entity2 failed to inspire @entity11 to a win that would have cemented his place in history			2
and it only got worse when @entity11 president @entity10 admitted she missed every game			2
' as you know , i 'm no soccer fan , ' she said , while standing next to @entity2 and @entity11 manager @entity28			2
' i did n't see a single match , not even the one yesterday ( on sunday )			2
' opinionated : @entity0 reckons @entity2 did n't deserve to win the award and it was all a ' marketing plan ' at least they like him : @entity0 was n't keen on @entity2 winning the @entity8 award on sunday @entity137 " surprised " by @entity2 's @entity8 award stick with them : @entity11 fans greeted their heroes hours after the final defeat to @entity14 @entity10 revealed she phoned @entity28 after the match because it felt like the team had won , regardless of the result			1
' that 's how i felt and how 40 million @entity25 felt too , ' she added			0
@entity11 did n't look completely crestfallen as @entity28 found time to have a joke , being handed a bottle of water by goalkeeper @entity152 to get his own back on @entity153			0
emotional supporters flooded the road leading from the airport to the @entity25 @entity158 complex in @entity159 , hours after their 1 - 0 defeat			1
@entity11 last played in a @entity4 final in 1990 , when they lost to @entity14 , and were looking to win the competition in their rival 's backyard			1
so close : an @entity11 fan kisses a replica of the @entity4 trophy , which they have n't won since 1986 passion : the emotional fans flooded the road leading from the airport to the @entity25 @entity158 complex upbeat : fans cheer in front of a huge image of superstar @entity2 , who won the @entity8 award @entity176 : @entity2 highlights			1

@entity11 beaten by @entity14 1 - 0 @entity178 in @entity4 final 2014 at @entity15
@entity2 won @entity8 ahead of the likes of @entity45 's @entity44 , @entity14 's @entity52 and @entity87 's @entity82
@entity0 calls it a ' marketing plan ' to give @entity2 the award
' when marketing people make him win something that he did n't win , it 's unfair , ' adds @entity0
@entity11 president @entity191 greets team but says : ' i did n't see a single match , not even the ( @entity4 final ) '
