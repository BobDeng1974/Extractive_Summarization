by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:21 est , 25 february 2014 @entity4 boss @entity3 has urged his squad not to replicate @entity7 's ill - advised break in @entity8 before this summer 's @entity9			1
the @entity11 striker visited @entity12 before @entity13 and the trip was thought by many to be the reason why he failed to hit top form for @entity4 during the tournament			1
@entity3 admitted he does not want to dictate where his players go before the showpiece event in @entity21 but has advised them against long - haul breaks			1
' but i certainly would n’t encourage them to go that far away , no. ' my advice will be if you are going to go away with your family , keep it much closer to home and avoid the very , very long journeys			2
' but whether or not i go as far as to say ' if you ’ve booked a holiday to @entity8 , then you can forget a place in my 23 " , i ’m not sure i ’ll go that far			2
' soaking up the rays : @entity31 enjoys the vegas sunshine in 2012 poolside relaxation : @entity31 and son @entity56 enjoy a break in @entity8 in 2012 on - form : @entity31 is currently firing on all cylinders for @entity11 and scored in the 2 - 0 win over @entity61 on saturday at @entity62 @entity3 also revealed during the programme his job of selecting 23 players for the @entity9 is far easier now than it would have been for @entity66 in 1998 , with less englishmen playing at the top level nowadays			1
the 66 - year - old chooses a 30 - man preliminary team for the tournament in @entity21 in may , and must cut the squad down to 23 in june before @entity4 's first match against @entity37 in @entity25 on june 14			1
and despite insisting his selection process will change significantly over the next three months , the @entity4 boss claims his job is simpler than @entity66 's was before the @entity9 in @entity77 in 1998			1
' we talk at great length about how there are n't too many @entity82 players today			2
i 've got to be honest , we 're not talking about as many as we were in the past			0
numbers game : @entity3 will be have to whittle down his preliminary 30 - man squad for the @entity9 to 23 glare of the media spotlight : @entity66 was @entity4 boss for the @entity9 in @entity77 and @entity3 believes his job of selecting a squad for the tournament is far easier than it was in 1998 ' @entity66 's job in 1998 was harder because there was such a big pool to choose from			1
it 's less difficult now because we do n't have that enormous choice anymore			0
' our 23 if picked today would no doubt vary by two or three names come may because situations change			0
we do n't have that many players			0
' we do nothing else but go through names of players			0
my whole life , in tandem with @entity107 ( @entity108 ) and @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , after every weekend we discuss the players we 've seen			0
their form , how that might change , it 's a continual process			2
' there 's going to be a time , of course , closer to the day where we have to sit down			0
at the moment you do n't make decisions because you do n't know what might change			0
