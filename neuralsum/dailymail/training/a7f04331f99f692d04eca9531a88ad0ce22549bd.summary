soft - shelled turtles – a popular delicacy priced at £ 5 – have their heads chopped off			1
cruelty : the reptiles and plucked from tanks and triple - wrapped in plastic bags , which slowly suffocates them the scenes were witnessed by the @entity24 in @entity25 yesterday and continue despite repeated promises from @entity0 dating back to 2007 to protect and promote animal welfare			1
the @entity29 - based @entity28 is demanding @entity0 reassess its business ethics and stops selling live creatures in their supermarkets			1
the group is behind a petition calling on the chain ’s chief executive , @entity35 , to stop the turtle sales , which has been signed by some 45,000 people			0
it says the supermarket giant should take responsibility for all stages of these creatures ‘ tortured existence ’ from being farmed in terrible conditions to being sold alive or butchered in store			0
spokesman for the group , @entity48 , said : ‘ we may think of turtles as pets like kittens and puppies , but @entity0 will butcher them in front of your eyes , or wrap them live in plastic , unable to breathe , advising you that it ’s best to eat them within the hour			1
‘ it is incredible for a company that claims to have high standards of animal welfare			0
just because it ’s in @entity5 , does n’t make it right			2
’ @entity5 is proving to be a tough market to crack for @entity0 , which is struggling to make money in the country			1
last month it announced a joint venture with @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , and the @entity29 firm will combine its @entity5 business , which includes 134 stores , with the 2,986 stores held by @entity74			1
suffering : the @entity24 witnessed a store attendant try repeatedly to behead a turtle the @entity24 went to the same @entity0 stores in @entity25 that were visited by @entity82 during a @entity29 trade mission in 2010			1
in one , members of staff in white uniforms were standing around the meat and fish counters where tanks held live turtles , fish , bull frogs and terrapins			2
one caught a turtle in a pair of 10 - inch metal tongs and wrapped it in three thin plastic bags			1
the turtle desperately fought to get out of the bag until it was returned to the customer service desk			0
at the @entity105 branch , a member of staff hacked at a soft shell turtle for seven minutes , trying to chop its head off			2
the middle - aged staff member turned with an impatient expression , and said : ‘ look , i ’ll let you know when it ’s done			2
the head wo n’t come out			0
’ five minutes later the grisly job was done and the butcher , with dark blood speckles on his apron , asked if we also wanted the head , too			0
animal activists say a turtle remains aware and able to move its eyes for up to an hour after decapitation unless their skulls are crushed with a hammer			2
an assistant explained : ‘ first you chop the head off and then you lift the turtle up so as to let the blood drain			0
‘ when you get home , put it in boiled water to sterilise it			0
after a few minutes later , take a knife and cut the shell off the turtle , remove the innards and rinse it			0
‘ then chop into pieces and it ’s done			0
’ the fresh water turtles are shipped from farms in @entity140 , a @entity141 coastal city			0
the meat sells for £ 6 - £ 10 a kilo			1
@entity0 customer @entity144 , a 30 - year - old from @entity25 , said : ‘ it ’s no big deal selling live turtles and bull frogs in the supermarket			1
‘ each country has its own tradition			0
the @entity29 people are against killing turtles or bull frogs because they do n’t have a tradition of eating them			0
‘ what do the @entity29 people think about eating cows and sheep ? ’ @entity0 insisted it operates to higher welfare standards than any other retailer in @entity5 and that its policies are driving up standards in the country ’s food supply industry			2
last night , a @entity0 spokesman said : ' we have listened to the concerns raised by our customers and as a result we have made several significant improvements , to ensure that the welfare of turtles sold in our @entity5 stores is of the highest possible standard			1
' we hope that these actions will help to drive up standards further throughout the supply chain			0
