by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 13 june 2012 it has long been a dream of man to possess the power to walk up vertical surfaces			0
and now the wait could finally be over thanks to a team of student engineers from @entity9 who have constructed their very own wall - crawler out of an adapted vacuum cleaner			1
their ' ascending @entity14 ' device , which is worn like a backpack , can climb 90ft up any surface - including glass , brick or rock - without a rope			1
they have now been given $ 100,000 to continue development after impressing military chiefs with their prototype			1
the @entity14 is powered by a battery which lasts for half an hour , far longer than the length of time anticipated for a soldier to hoist himself over a wall			1
but the most important element of the team 's mission was to come up with technology that can grip to any vertical surface			2
they developed the @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , which is made from two suction pads and bits and bobs from a household vacuum cleaner			2
the pads , unsurprisingly , form an airtight seal when pressed against a vertical surface which is strengthened by the suction from the vacuum			0
the engineers have now been given $ 100,000 to continue development after impressing military chiefs with their prototype future improvements : the team wants to make the pack smaller , less heavy and less noisy it can also be operated hands - free , allowing a soldier to wield a weapon or other device without falling to the ground			1
dr @entity31 told @entity77 : ' the beauty of this solution was that it is relatively surface independent , allowing a soldier to use a weapon or other device while hanging from the @entity56			0
' one major drawback is the noise the @entity14 currently makes , which totally destroys any chance of achieving a surprise attack			2
but the @entity9 team hopes to tackle this next			1
dr @entity31 said : ' this is not a major problem in a daytime urban environment , but is a problem in a nighttime stealth operation			0
' in the next version , technology will be used or developed to suppress , reduce , or cancel the noise of the vacuums and the motors			0
' other improvements the engineers want to implement are to make the pack smaller and less heavy .			0

their ' @entity14 ' device , which is worn like a backpack , was developed by student engineers at @entity9
@entity34 @entity33 has *awarded* team $ 100,000 to continue developing prototype
