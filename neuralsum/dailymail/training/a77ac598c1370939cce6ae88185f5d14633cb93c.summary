by @entity0 published : 15:06 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 15:06 est , 2 october 2013 have you ever fantasised about owning the perfect capsule wardrobe ? i do			1
in my fantasy wardrobe , all the items not only suit me perfectly , but suit each other perfectly , too			1
they can be worn in any combination , each resulting in a polished , stylish look			1
but it would cost a fortune to chuck out all your mis - matched fashion mistakes and start over , would n't it ? well , actually , no. as the battle for ' non-food sales ' between the big - name supermarkets gets ever more intense , so their affordable fashion offerings go from strength to strength			1
so i set myself a challenge			1
could i assemble the perfect capsule wardrobe for autumn - including shoes and accessories - from only supermarket ranges ? and could i do so by spending no more than i would on my weekly food shop for a family of four , £ 150 ? the results might surprise you ... the look : a sweater and trousers under a camel wrap - coat fits perfectly with this autumn 's trend for all things ladylike			1
why did i pick it ? the sandals and sweater can easily be replaced with ankle boots and a polo neck ( which you may already own ) once winter sets in			1
supermarket strengths : @entity49 is the strongest supermarket for knitwear			1
this camel number i picked out is sleek and does n’t look prone to sagging or bobbling			1
wow factor : my girlfriends love this look - two of them have already ordered the coat			1
styling tip : supermarket coats and jackets are sometimes let down by cheap buttons or belt buckles , so pick a style like this with as few fastenings as possible			2
the look : leather is big this autumn , as is off - white - so this outfit ticked two boxes			2
why did i pick it ? the blouse can be swapped for the camel sweater , and the sandals for boots if you have some , when it gets colder			2
supermarket strengths : @entity49 does skirts extremely well , and is also strong on footwear			2
these sandals are surprisingly wearable			2
wow factor : the skirt provoked a mixed reaction among my friends - some felt leather should be left alone by the over- 25s - but i love it			2
styling tips : the skirt is ' pleather ' ( plastic leather ) , but is that a bad thing ? real leather skirts and trousers tend to bag around the knees and the bottom			2
the look : high - end designers sent a myriad of prints down catwalks for autumn / winter 2013			2
super-markets have picked up the trend			0
why did i pick it ? i particularly like the fabric of this dress , which sucks in my body in all the right places			0
although it ’s only £ 25 , its fabric feels far more expensive			1
supermarket strengths : @entity49 is the strongest brand for dresses when it comes to fabric and fit			0
wow factor : my husband was a fan of this dress ( no surprises there ) , but he said the skirt was rather long ( no surprises there , either ! )			0
styling tip : although this one has thick fabric , supermarket dresses can feel flimsy			0
if this is the case , go up a size from your usual fitting — the extra fabric will give a more luxurious feel			0
the look : i love this @entity137 vibe - i wore it on a night out with some fashion - forward girlfriends who wear high - end @entity139 or designer clothes			1
and i did n't feel in the slightest bit self - conscious			0
why did i pick it ? a special thank you to @entity145 for producing a pair of tailored trousers that are n't several yards too long ( at 5ft 3in , i often struggle with unwanted trouser fabric )			1
supermarket strengths : @entity150 does the best trousers for shorter women			0
wow factor : my girlfriends quizzed me relentlessly about the provenance of my outfit			0
their final guess was @entity159 - they were stunned when i revealed that every item was from a supermarket			0
styling tips : if you choose a boxy - shaped blouse ( as opposed to a longer one or something with a ducktail back ) , then you can wear it tucked in , too			0
the look : this is my first lady outfit			0
i ’m channelling @entity170 — after all , she understands the ladylike trend better than most			0
why did i pick it ? there ’s a big trend for capes at the moment , so why not try draping your coat to achieve the same effect ? supermarket strengths : @entity180 at @entity181 is very strong for coats			1
i picked out this wrap - coat for my capsule wardrobe but was also tempted by a monochrome cocoon coat ( a key shape this autumn )			1
wow factor : this look was a hit with male and female friends			0
it ’s sexy but sophisticated			0
styling tip : when buying a coat from a supermarket , it ’s worth sitting down in it and then looking at the back before you buy it			1
some of the cheaper fabrics are very prone to creasing .			0
