by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 9 november 2013 as a child , @entity1 could often be found tidying the family kitchen while her friends played outside			1
not , she says , because it was dirty but because her mother had not organised the shelves as she thought they ought to be			1
‘ she ’d freak me out , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ she would have soup tins in different cupboards instead of them being all together			2
it would upset me and i had to do something about it			2
@entity16 would love it and say , “ @entity1 ’s organising the kitchen ! ” ' it makes me who i am ' : @entity1 , founder of lingerie brand @entity21 , has suffered from @entity22 most of her life ‘ another thing that would panic me would be if she was was n’t able to find a jumper			1
i have to know where everything is			2
even today , my friends beg me to tidy their cupboards but it ’s just normal for me to have everything in order			2
’ order is a way of life for @entity1			1
the dynamic entrepreneur , founder of the @entity21 lingerie brand , is one of about three per cent of the @entity37 population who suffer with obsessive compulsive disorder ( @entity22 )			1
the mental health condition is characterised by obsessive thoughts that are only relieved by compulsive repetitive rituals that include washing , cleaning and checking			2
@entity45 famously claimed to have @entity22 , which manifested in a need to have everything around him in straight lines or in pairs			1
symptoms of the disorder can range from mild to debilitating – many sufferers describe unwanted thoughts , such as becoming fixated by the worry that they may do unspeakable harm to themselves or others , and the anxiety caused by this can be overwhelming			1
broken marriage : @entity1 divorced ex @entity63 after she discovered that he had an affair with one of her bra designers at @entity21 - she later bought him out of the company yet , astonishingly , @entity1 is somewhat proud of the positive things @entity22 have given her			1
‘ i can cope with anything in life , ’ she says			2
‘ i have coped with chaos and it ’s me that people come running to if there is an issue			2
but i can not function if i have a messy wardrobe			2
i say to people , “ organise your drawers before you face the world			1
” ‘ do i want to stop it ? no. i can cope with a hell of a lot more in business because of @entity22			1
i know where things are , i work faster , and i can take on a lot more			2
do i have ocd ? symptoms vary			1
some people spend less than an hour engaged in obsessive - compulsive behaviour – for others it may consume their whole day			1
the ocdaction.org.uk online survey should help determine if you should visit your gp			0
@entity97 may run in families and is linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain ’s development			0
the typical onset for @entity22 is between the ages of six and 15 for males , and 20 and 29 for women			1
up to four per cent of women develop @entity22 during pregnancy or after giving birth			1
brain - imaging studies have shown that those with @entity22 have abnormalities in some parts of the brain including increased activity and blood flow , plus a lack of serotonin			1
this chemical transmits information from one brain cell to another , and regulates anxiety , mood , memory and sleep			0
medication that increases serotonin levels has proven effective in treating @entity22			1
@entity127 ? treatment is likely to involve behavioural therapy to help reduce anxiety			0
disruption of daily function is described as functional impairment			0
@entity22 that causes mild impairment is usually treated with cognitive behavioural therapy – managing problems by changing the way you think and behave			1
if you have ocd that causes moderate functional impairment , you may be offered antidepressants			2
‘ being organised has kept me in control			0
my mum has said , “ i do n’t know how you ’ve dealt with everything and not had a breakdown			0
” ’ the ‘ everything ’ @entity1 is referring to is her ‘ year of hell ’ , in which her painful divorce was finalised			1
her ex-husband @entity63 , who was also her business partner , worked alongside her until his affair with a young designer in 2011			2
@entity1 , 42 , subsequently bought him out of @entity21 , and this month she did the same with their other business , @entity154 , a herbal supplement that she has taken herself for the past four years and which , along with a serious workout regime , has helped her lose 7st			1
despite her lifelong obsessions with sorting and extreme tidiness – and @entity1 recognising her behaviour was unusual – she was diagnosed with @entity22 only in her 30s			1
she was making a tv programme at the time , and psychologists working on the same show noticed how she would repeatedly reorganise a room before she felt able to sit down			1
they suggested to her that she was suffering from @entity22 and @entity166 recognised the symptoms , though she has never sought professional help			1
she has , however , worked tirelessly to control her symptoms , which crept into her work life when she started @entity21 in 1996			0
back then she felt the need to tidy the desks of other staff when they were not around but realised this obsession could not continue			0
‘ i have got better in the office , ’ admits @entity1			1
‘ i ’m now more aware of how i affect people and that you just ca n’t do that with their own space			0
‘ but i do insist that all @entity182 files that are left out must have the subject typed out in the same font and the same size			0
there must be no handwriting as it looks disgusting			0
’ signs of @entity22 were more apparent in her former family home in @entity191 , near @entity192 – a house that had four dishwashers			1
‘ it sounds excessive as not everyone has a dishwasher , but we had the space and when we entertained friends for dinner i could not bear the idea of seeing dirty dishes in the sink as it would really upset me			2
' having those four dishwashers made me feel good			2
’ mother - of - three @entity1 has just spent ten months overseeing the refurbishment of her new home , a @entity210 townhouse , using the furniture supplier of @entity212 where she stays when in @entity213			1
‘ it was a full - time job in itself even though i had a team working on it			2
i oversaw all the plans and every last detail			0
everything had to be right , ’ she says emphatically			0
@entity218 queen : @entity1 thanks her @entity22 for helping her get her life back together ‘ the handles have to be a certain way , the lights have to be in line			1
‘ the obsessions have become worse as i ’ve got older			0
for example , i can have just got off a flight from @entity228 but if i walk into the kitchen and see the salt left out , so there is a mess , i then have to check every cupboard and go from room to room checking that everything is in order			2
‘ i have to make sure each pillow is lined up			0
i have to check that my wardrobe is organised			0
i have the same hangers and need to see them lined up as i like them			0
only then would i be able to sleep peacefully			0
‘ if i go into my son @entity243 ’s bedroom , i may say to him , “ you do realise the pillow zips are up the wrong way ? ” and when he ’s not around , i fix it all			0
he says , “ @entity16 , i do n’t think you realise how tidy we are as a family ! ” ’ mummy 's little helper : @entity1 , pictured age four , used to re-organise her mother 's kitchen as a child while @entity1 and her relatives are used to her rituals , should an unsuspecting shop assistant ever hand over a crumpled bank note in change to @entity1 , she will simply ask for another			1
‘ i have done that before now in @entity266 , ’ she says			0
‘ how dare they give me something so crunched up and disgusting ? i ca n’t bear it			0
all the notes in my purse are neat and must be lined up with the heads facing the right way and in order of fives , tens and twenties			0
’ @entity1 ’s way of doing things has also already proved a stumbling block in a relationship			1
‘ i have been single for a year but i was seeing a guy in @entity283 , ’ she confesses			2
‘ he did n’t like me fussing and told me to leave his pillows alone			0
i ca n’t understand how a guy would want to deal with a messy woman who leaves her make - up everywhere and has a messy wardrobe			2
if i was a guy i would throw her out			0
’ besides her tidying rituals , @entity1 ’s habits extend to eating			1
‘ if i eat breakfast i have a white omelette with chilli and ham			0
and if i find a good restaurant i keep going back there			0
i do n’t want to be disappointed by going somewhere else that i do n’t know will be as good			0
’ cognitive behavioural therapist @entity298 explains what is going on in the mind of an @entity22 sufferer : ‘ there are two components			1
the obsessional aspect is where a person churns the same thoughts over and over			0
' this is an intrusive thought which they feel uncomfortable about			0
’ for example , there being germs everywhere			0
‘ this causes the psychological discomfort so they then go through a series of compulsive rituals to neutralise that discomfort , such as washing hands or lining up pencils			0
’ the exact causes of @entity22 are unknown although genetics are thought to be involved			1
a person with @entity22 is four times as likely to have a family member with the same condition			1
it is also thought to be related to other illnesses such as @entity330 ’s syndrome			0
yet unlike so many sufferers who feel embarrassment and try to hide the condition , @entity1 ’s professional success – she was awarded an obe in 2010 – has given her a confidence to confront every aspect of her personality			1
she says : ‘ i have n’t inherited it from anyone and there is no sign of it in my children			0
but @entity22 defines who i am as a person			1
‘ i do n’t think it ’s an illness			0
i would say it ’s what makes me perform so well and makes me unique			0

lingerie tycoon @entity1 was diagnosed with @entity22 in her 30s
she has four dishwashers in her home as she can not bare dirty plates
her ocd also means she needs to organise a room before she can sit down
the 42 - year - old thanks her disorder for getting through her 2011 divorce
