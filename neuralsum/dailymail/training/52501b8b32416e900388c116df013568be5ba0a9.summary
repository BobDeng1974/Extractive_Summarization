scientists have long been baffled by why animals took so long to thrive on @entity2			0
prehistoric creatures first began to prosper at the end of the proterozoic period , around 800 million years ago , but for a billion years before that , only very basic forms of life developed			1
geologists have put this ‘ boring ’ billion years down to poor air quality by discovering that oxygen levels were insufficient to support animals			1
prehistoric creatures first began to prosper at the end of the proterozoic period , about 800 million years ago because before that , oxygen levels were too low - 0.1 per cent of what they are today - to support the rise of animals such as the comb jelly ( pictured ) a primitive jellyfish among the first complex creatures international researchers led by a team at @entity24 in @entity25 , found that oxygen levels during the ‘ boring ’ period were only 0.1 per cent of what they are today			1
@entity29 , assistant professor at @entity24 , explained that @entity2 ’s atmosphere could n’t have supported a diversity of creatures , no matter what genetic advancements were poised to occur			1
‘ there is no question that genetic and ecological innovation must ultimately be behind the rise of animals , but it is equally unavoidable that animals need a certain level of oxygen , ’ he said			0
professor @entity29 of @entity24 ( pictured right ) and professor @entity43 of @entity44 ( left ) were among experts who studied chromium isotopes in ancient sediments to study ancient oxygen levels research is ongoing to more accurately date when different stages of life appeared on @entity2 , which which a over 4.5 billion years old			1
3.8 billion years ago it 's thought that first life arose in the form of simple cells 2.1 billion years ago multicellular life began to evolve			2
800 million to 600 million years ago the first animals appeared , including the first arthropods and later fish			1
475 million years ago saw the birth of plants on land			2
400 years ago , insects and seeds appeared			0
360 million years ago amphibians began to evolve and 300 million years ago , reptiles , with dinosaurs following soon afterwards			2
200 million years ago the first mammals appeared			2
150 million years ago birds began to develop			2
130 million years ago saw the birth of flowers			2
60 million years ago , primates arrived on @entity2			1
2.5 million years ago the genus @entity74 ( including humans and our predecessors ) arrived , leading to the evolution of anatomically modern humans 200,000 years ago			1
‘ we ’re providing the first evidence that oxygen levels were low enough during this period to potentially prevent the rise of animals			0
’ together with professor @entity43 , he analysed chromium isotopes in ancient sediments from @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , and the @entity90 to examine ancient oxygen levels			1
@entity92 is found in the @entity2 ’s continental crust , and chromium oxidation is directly linked to the presence of free oxygen in the atmosphere , according to the study , published in the journal @entity100			1
they studied samples deposited in shallow , iron - rich ocean areas , near the shore and compared their data with other samples taken from younger locations known to have higher levels of oxygen			0
scientists have long been baffled about oxygen ’s role in controlling the first appearance of animals and professor @entity29 believes that chromium has helped to solve the mystery			0
previous estimates put oxygen levels at 40 per cent of today ’s conditions during pre-animal times , suggesting that oxygen was already plentiful enough to support animal life			0
in the new study , the researchers acknowledged that oxygen levels were ‘ highly dynamic ’ in the early atmosphere , with the potential for occasional spikes			0
however , they say , ‘ it seems clear that there is a first - order difference in the nature of @entity2 surface chromium cycling ’ before and after the rise of animals			0
co-author of the study , @entity135 of the @entity136 , @entity134 said : ‘ if we are right , our results will really change how people view the origins of animals and other complex life , and their relationships to the co-evolving environment			0
this could be a game - changer			0

animals arrived 800 million years ago and scientists have only just proved that they could not have thrives before then because of oxygen levels
experts led by @entity24 in @entity154 found that oxygen levels one billion years before animals were only 0.1 *percent* of what they are today
they say the @entity2 ’s atmosphere could n’t have supported a diversity of creatures , no matter what genetic advancements were poised to occur
