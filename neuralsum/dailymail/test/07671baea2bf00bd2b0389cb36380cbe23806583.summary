it was ten minutes short of 1am when @entity1 left the @entity2 last night			1
he did so beaming from ear to ear , admitting that he had seen the tweets from his @entity7 team - mates congratulating him on scoring what he called ‘ one of the most important goals of my life ’			1
not everyone had been as complimentary as @entity14 and @entity15 , with @entity17 pundit @entity16 criticizing him for not immediately running to @entity18 who played the ball to him for the goal			2
@entity1 ( left ) scores to send @entity23 into the @entity25 semi-final @entity1 struck in the 88th minute to send @entity23 through and fierce rivals @entity26 out @entity28 ( left ) say @entity1 scored ' the goal of his life ' while @entity31 praises ' @entity32 ' for winning the tie to pick up on that and not on the out - pouring of elation is to not understand just how much the @entity37 striker has toiled for the last two seasons desperate for a chance to do what he feels he does best – score big goals in big games			1
‘ it was a great assist [ from @entity18 ] ’ he said after the match once the adrenalin levels that sent him sprinting towards the @entity23 supporters behind the stadium ’s south goal , had subsided			1
despite starting only seven of the fifty games @entity23 have played this season @entity1 has wriggled his way into the affections of the club ’s supporters much and on three occasions , he got himself into goalscoring positions on wednesday night			1
with the first two opportunities he snatched at the chance – shooting woefully into the side netting in the first half with @entity18 and @entity62 better placed , and pulling another shot across the face of the goal in the second period			2
but when he hit the target with the third opportunity the stadium responded			0
his name echoed around all four sides of the ground and that is not something afforded lightly to any player in their first campaign			0
there was nothing special about the finish but getting there , to apply it when for the previous 88 minutes he had run himself into the ground does deserve credit and he had around 80,000 spectators wanting to thank him personally at the end			0
@entity18 ( centre ) provided a splendid assist for @entity1 's goal in the @entity25 @entity1 celebrates @entity23 's victory with team - mate ronaldo after the final whistle @entity7 midfielder @entity14 led the tributes to @entity1 on @entity94 after the game the @entity97 radio journalists who mobbed him as he emerged from some post-match physiotherapy , all wanted to ask him about the last great @entity37 striker to wear the white shirt , @entity101			1
with a goals - per - minutes ratio that is better than @entity104 ’s , there are even claims he should be starting more games			2
he replaced the @entity106 last night because of a knee injury that may yet sideline him for another couple of games			0
once the euphoria of a last gasp winner subsides , @entity104 ’s extra quality has to be recognized and ‘ @entity32 ’s ’ place will eventually be back on the bench			2
in the longer - term he could satisfy himself in the knowledge that injuries will always present him with chances like last night			0
but he wants to be playing regularly and that will mean at the end of the season , when he returns to @entity7 , it will be to seek a new permanent deal elsewhere			1
‘ he has suffered ’ said @entity123 after the game			0
‘ he deserved the goal because he has never given in			0
he always trains well and he always gives everything when he plays			0
it ’s a great reward for him			0
’ had the 88th minute strike not come and @entity26 held on to win on penalties , @entity123 would have been criticized for his faith in the @entity37 and the ‘ @entity130 ’ might have played his last minutes for @entity23 with only the league left to contest			1
some believe @entity1 should start more often ahead of @entity104 , who currently has a knee injury @entity1 missed a couple of chances before scoring , but his persistence eventually paid off for @entity23 @entity23 's players celebrate after @entity1 's late goal secured progress to the @entity25 semi-final as it is @entity23 still have nine games to play and he will play his part			1
he has already written himself a little piece of @entity23 history and reminded everyone what he can do			2
no wonder he ran straight to supporters to wildly celebrate ; no wonder he did n’t want to leave the stadium last night .			0

@entity1 got @entity23 's @entity25 winner against @entity26
@entity1 described it as ' one of the most important goals of my life '
he is set to seek a new team when his loan from @entity7 ends
