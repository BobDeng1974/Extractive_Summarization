covers lay like palls over the rest of @entity4 ’s courts			1
people huddled their strawberries under umbrellas and their dresses under ponchos			2
but below the roof of @entity11 came a performance from @entity13 as brilliant as a true summer ’s day			1
the lights shone down as they might on a boxing ring			2
@entity18 lent his own air of authenticity to the analogy , for he is the @entity22 of tennis , at least in terms of appearance			2
roaring success : @entity13 celebrates his victory over @entity18 blown away : @entity18 could not live with @entity13 losing in straights sets on monday but he could barely lay a glove , or racket string , on the @entity31 , who efficiently and relentlessly put down his marker as the champion in waiting			1
so one - sided was the contest that from early on @entity18 ’s every winning point was cheered loudly			2
not only because he is a firm favourite of the crowd for his all - action , all - heart style , but because he was in grave danger of humiliation , and the worst sentiment a sportsman can experience — pity — was being lavished upon him			2
those fears were hardly misplaced			0
the match was over in a trice			0
the rules allowed play to have gone on until 11pm , but that never looked likely from the moment the first set was concluded in just 25 lopsided minutes , @entity13 having taken a stranglehold on proceedings by breaking @entity18 to go 5 - 2 ahead			1
at that point the people in the @entity54 were still reconvening in their seats , having taken a comfort break following @entity58 ’s similarly brisk victory on the same rectangle of covered grass			1
the second set followed a similar pattern			0
@entity13 broke his opponent in the seventh game and went on to close it out with near - immaculate precision			1
@entity18 ’s resistance in saving three set points was merely a stay of execution			0
@entity4 : day seven roundup eyes on the prize : @entity13 will be looking to go one better this year after losing in last year 's final flying out : @entity18 spectacularly misses the ball as he struggles against @entity13 of course , @entity18 is a battler			1
his engine is nearly inexhaustible — he played 509 minutes en route to this fourth - round match			2
and his greatest scalp ever , victory over @entity82 here in 2011 , came from two sets down			0
was a repeat even remotely possible ? there was a moment in the third when it looked as if it might , just might , be			0
the crowd ’s cheers were at @entity18 ’s back in the eighth game			0
he led 4 - 3 and had two break points			1
but @entity13 was calm calculation personified			1
he held his nerve and his service game before letting out a loud raw of emotion in delight			0
@entity18 , though , fought back			0
he won the next game to love to go 5 - 4 ahead			1
@entity102 was pumping right through him			0
he was holding nothing back			0
every ball was hit with all the power his big , ali - frame could muster			2
he went on to lead 6 - 5			1
the rallies were short bordering on non-existent			0
watching brief : @entity108 look on as his charge @entity13 storms to victory past @entity18 with the clock ticking towards 9pm , the set went into a tiebreak , such an arm wrestle of serving mastery			1
finally on match point , @entity13 returned a backhand winner so close to the line it was called out			1
he celebrated in a star - shaped stance of impregnability , his head nodding in satisfaction			2
realising the point had been given against him , he challenged it and was vindicated			0
game , set and destruction			0
all this precision was remarkable considering in what state we last saw @entity13			1
he hit his left shoulder on the baseline grass in the previous round , fearing his involvement in the tournament might come to the least satisfactory of early conclusions			0
gracious : @entity18 ( left ) congratulates @entity13 after their fourth round match but he showed not the least flicker of pain until he clutched it in the tiebreak , but , as last friday , it did nothing to stop his progression			1
perhaps we should have expected such a one - sided encounter			2
@entity13 was on a 10 - match winning streak against the @entity149 , who had not taken a set from him in two years			1
in another statement of consistency , @entity13 was gunning for his 21st straight @entity154 quarter - final and his sixth consecutively at @entity4			1
but @entity18 played his part			0
the standard of his game was hardly poor , and at times outstandingly strong			0
but @entity13 was like a machine , every point devised with computer - like precision and the emotional detachment of a factory machine			1
it is a form of genius .			0

@entity4 top seed wins 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 to reach quarter finals
