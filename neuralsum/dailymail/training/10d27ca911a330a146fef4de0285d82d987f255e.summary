by @entity0 published : 08:43 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 12:53 est , 11 november 2013 shocked : @entity1 said on today 's @entity2 that she was surprised by @entity4 's revelations @entity5 has revealed she 's started legal action against the publishers of @entity4 's autobiography			1
despite admitting she has n't yet read the book herself , the 52 - year - old @entity10 socialite said the contents breach a confidentiality agreement she signed with her ex-partner			1
' i just started legal action against the publishers			2
he is in breach of confidential order that we can not talk about certain details , so i am surprised at the publishers			1
it 's breach of confidentiality , ' she said during an appearance on today 's @entity2			1
presenters @entity27 and @entity28 were thrown by the revelation which comes after the former @entity31 manager , 65 , published a tell - all book with @entity33			1
in it , he claimed his nine - year relationship with @entity1 had been a mistake after they started an affair while she was still married			2
he said he later regretted the fact @entity1 left her husband for him as , after a romantic first few months together , she became increasingly demanding and annoying			2
he wrote : ' @entity1 was very demanding			2
and it did n't take long before i started to feel a little cramped by her			2
she always had to be the centre of attention - and i was n't used to this in a woman			0
' he added that if they went out , she would always make a fuss complaining about anything from the lighting to the drinks			0
defending herself on this morning , @entity1 said : ' that does sound like me but he met me when i was with my husband , it was not a surprise			0
of course i am demanding , if the champagne is not cold enough i will complain			0
is anyone surprised by this ? ' she added that she was ' saddened and surprised ' by many of @entity4 's comments , including him stating that she would n't have been interested in him if he ' was a plumber '			1
' it 's funny , he was just a football manager , ' she said			1
she said : ' you would expect a football manager to write about football			0
but people are not interested in that , that is the point			0
he had a fantastic career but why has he been forced to write a horrible book like this and how proud he is of all the affairs he had			1
' i do n't recognise him completely			0
he does n't sound like the person i met			0
' @entity4 had a number of affairs while he was living with @entity1 and they eventually separated in 2006			1
she revealed on this morning that the end did n't come because of his infidelity but because they fell out over her own plans to write a book			1
' is anyone surprised by this ? ' @entity1 agreed she could be demanding as a girlfriend she explained : ' he did n't want me to write a book but i told him he had no right to tell me that			1
i assured him i would n't write anything that was offensive			0
but we separated because he did n't want me to write the book			2
of course he had to be in it because he was part of my life for 10 years			0
' @entity1 did keep her word and described her relationship with @entity4 in her book as ' blissful throughout			1
' she admitted on this morning this may have sugar - coated their time together somewhat as they had ' beautiful moments and terrible moments			0
' bitter split : the couple separated in 2006 and @entity1 said they no longer speak except through their lawyers she added that it 's a shame they are no longer friends and only see one another now with their lawyers			2
after they split , they fought a bitter legal battle over their former @entity129 home after she refused to move out of the £ 3.75million flat in @entity131			0
she finally agreed to leave the apartment in april this year after he promised her £ 2 million			0
but it seems their legal battles are now set to continue			0
