earlier this month , the @entity1 family jetted off on their summer holiday from @entity4			0
instead of getting up horrendously early for the three - hour drive from @entity7 to the airport , we chose the far more civilised option of staying in a hotel at @entity4 the night before			1
we booked in to the new @entity11 by @entity12 ( hamptoninn3.hilton.com ) , paying £ 84 b&b for a family of four			1
the hotel is joined to @entity4 's @entity18 by a 50 - yard walkway , and even if your flight is from the @entity29 , it 's still a great location : the shuttle train between the terminals is a short walk away			0
the hotel 's bedrooms are perfectly sound - proofed and comfy , with big walk - in showers			1
in our room , the sofa bed was a bit of a squeeze for our two boys , but the moment i politely pointed this out to the receptionist , she gave us a second room at no extra cost - thanks to the chain 's no - quibble satisfaction guarantee			1
after a very decent breakfast , we made our way in leisurely fashion directly to airport security			0
we 'd checked in our bags the previous evening - another advantage of staying overnight at the airport			1
if you fancy doing the same this summer , here are my tips for booking affordable airport hotels ... a night at the @entity63 will cost £ 49 to £ 63 , room - only , if you book for a night in the next few weeks			1
but book now for january and the cost is £ 35 on most nights short stroll : guests can walk to @entity4 's @entity18 or catch the shuttle train to the @entity29 book well ahead though the price at the @entity11 by @entity17 does n't vary much , at other hotels rates can be a good deal cheaper if you book well ahead			2
for example , a night at the @entity63 ( premierinn.com ) will cost £ 49 to £ 63 , room - only , if you book for a night in the next few weeks			2
but book now for january and the cost is £ 35 on most nights			0
at the @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , the rates for january are as low as £ 29			0
compare the deals go to @entity81 ( holidayextras.co.uk ) , an agent specialising in airport hotels			0
its website shows you at a glance the rates on your chosen night at a wide selection of hotels - along with detailed information on each hotel and hundreds of guest reviews			2
also look at gosimply.com , which compares airport hotel rates from other agents			0
at some airport hotels , a night 's stay plus parking can cost little more than the cost of parking on its own cutting the cost : the @entity103 @entity78 was charging £ 114.85 for a 15 - night @entity104 in early september @entity105 - and - stay at some airport hotels , the cost of the night 's stay and a week or fortnight 's parking can come to little more than the cost of airport parking on its own			1
in early september at the @entity103 @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , i was quoted £ 114.85 for a 15 - night sleep , park , fly package			2
parking on its own would cost £ 106.26			2
@entity116 ' cheaper ' options staying at a ' cheaper ' hotel a few miles from the airport can be a false economy			1
lengthy transfers from the hotel to the airport can not only waste time but also cost extra			0
the website holidayextras.co.uk usefully indicates the time and cost of the transfers .			0

overnight stay is a civilised option and bags can be checked in night before
@entity11 by @entity12 costs £ 84 for family of four
rooms are sound - proofed and hotel offers no - quibble guarantee
cost of stay can come to little more than cost of airport parking
but staying at a hotel a few miles from the airport can be a false economy
