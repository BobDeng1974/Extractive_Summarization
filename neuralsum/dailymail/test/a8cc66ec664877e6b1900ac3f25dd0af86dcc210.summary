@entity0 has finally passed a law banning bestiality in an attempt to crack down on perverts visiting the country to have sex with animals			1
the @entity9 country decided to tighten up its laws amid reports of animal sex shows , clubs and even animal brothels frequented by tourists taking advantage of its lax regulations			1
the previous law only stipulated a ban on intercourse which harmed the animals			2
new law : the @entity0 government bought in tougher legislation amid fears their relaxed legal stance on bestiality was making the country a destination for people who wanted to have sex with animals but agricultural minister @entity33 pointed out it was difficult to prove whether or not the animal had been harmed			2
' the current legislation does not protect the animals enough , ' he wrote in an opinion piece			0
' it 's hard to prove that an animal suffers when a human has sexual intercourse with it , and that is why we must give the animal the benefit of the doubt			0
' those voting for the bill said @entity0 did not want to remain the last northern @entity52 country where bestiality was legal , as this was attracting animal sex tourists			1
@entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 previously banned it			0
' there are frequent reports of the occurrence of organised animal sex shows , clubs and animal brothels in @entity0 , ' the @entity60 , an independent advisory board under the food and agriculture ministry , said in a report , while adding that it had not been able to verify the reports			1
tourist destination : there were reports of animal sex shows , clubs and even brothels in the @entity9 country an investigation by the now defunct @entity0 newspaper 24timer about 10 years ago found animal owners were openly advertising their animals ' services ' for sale ' , for between £ 57 and £ 113 - depending on what was required			1
more recently , a 2011 @entity86 report surveyed veterinarians and found 17 percent of them suspected that an animal they treated had had intercourse with a human			0
the advent of the internet no doubt helped the boom in animal sex tourism : there are entire forums dedicated to helping people swap advice on bestiality , as well as pornography			2
the move leaves few countries in the world where bestiality is still legal : within @entity52 , it leaves just @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
in the @entity111 , laws surrounding bestiality vary from state to state : @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 are some of the states where there is no law against it .			0

@entity0 's previous law only banned bestiality if it harmed the animal
decided to toughen up laws after it became a stop for animal sex tourists
there are reports of animal sex shows , clubs and even animal brothels
almost one in five vets suspect they have treated an bestiality victim
