@entity1 admitted before the @entity2 draw that he was dreaming of a tie against former club @entity4 , it 's a dream he 'll be living come february			1
the @entity7 manager spent seven years at @entity4 between 1987 and 1994 , winning both the @entity9 title and the @entity10			1
just as he would in both @entity11 and north @entity12 , @entity1 re-shaped @entity4 upon arrival			2
he persuaded @entity14 to join on a free transfer from @entity16 while defender @entity17 also moved to the principality after his @entity20 contract expired			0
forward @entity21 joined too after a successful three years in @entity22 with @entity23			0
then - @entity4 manager @entity1 in training with @entity14 in 1987 ; @entity14 was one of the @entity26 's first signing 's upon moving to the club , he persuaded the @entity29 international midfielder to join on a free transfer from @entity16 @entity1 stands with his two new signings in the summer of 1987 ; @entity21 ( left ) joined the @entity9 side after three seasons in @entity22 with @entity23 and said at the time that the opportunity to play alongside @entity14 ( right ) was won of the factors that encouraged him to do so @entity1 ( centre left ) , pictured here in 1989 , leads his @entity4 players on a run during a training session - he is joined by midfielder and current @entity43 manager @entity42 ( left ) , midfielder @entity44 ( cente right ) and @entity10 international midfielder @entity46 ( right ) the @entity26 , pictured here in his final two years ( left - 1993 , right - 1994 ) at the @entity9 club ; @entity49 came calling for @entity1 in his penultimate season with @entity4 but the club refused to let him leave , they sacked him early in the 1994 - 95 season after a poor start @entity1 sits in the dugout with his coaching staff during the 1992 @entity56 against @entity57 at the @entity58 in @entity59 - the @entity61 side ran out 2 - 0 winners courtesy of goals from @entity67 international @entity65 and @entity69 @entity68 1987 - 88 : wins ligue 1 in his first season 1988 - 89 : finishes third in the league , loses in @entity10 final to @entity75 1989 - 90 : finishes third in the league 1990 - 91 : wins @entity10 1991 - 92 : finishes second in the league , loses in @entity56 final 1992 - 93 : finishes second in the league 1993 - 94 : finishes ninth in the league 1994 - 95 : sacked in september with @entity4 17th in the table @entity1 's success was instantaneous , he won the league in his first season and managed to sign a young @entity90 the following summer			1
but the second season was one of frustration for @entity1 after he lost in the final of the @entity10 to bitter rivals @entity75 and finished third in the league behind @entity75 and @entity96			2
@entity1 tasted success again in 1991 when his side got revenge on @entity75 by beating them in the final of the @entity10			1
but the years that followed saw a steady decline both in terms of trophies won and also final league positions			0
he did , however , reach the final of the @entity56 in 1992 and helped to develop a number of talented players at the club , including @entity7 's future record goal scorer @entity110			2
in his penultimate season at the club @entity49 made an approach for @entity1			0
@entity4 refused to let him join the @entity61 giants but then sacked him early in the 1994 - 95 season after a string of poor results that left them 17th in the table			0
the @entity26 could have stayed in his native country but problems with domestic match - fixing and bribery , which @entity75 were found guilty of in 1994 , had tainted his view of the league and he instead opted for a move to @entity11			0
the former @entity127 manager stands in the @entity129 stadium in @entity4 in 1993 with new signing @entity130 - the @entity133 international attacking midfielder had impressed at @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 before joining @entity1 's team @entity1 sits in the dugout for a @entity9 match in 1989 next to his assistant @entity141 ( right ) - @entity141 spent almost his entire playing for @entity4 and won the league title with them as a player in 1978 , in total he scored 76 goals for them in 428 senior appearances a youthful @entity1 practises his kick - ups during training in 1989 - his second season in @entity4 proved frustrating after scoring more goals than the previous season but losing out to fierce rivals @entity75 in the league and final of the @entity10 @entity4 club president @entity157 ( right ) during a press conference with @entity1 , who he brought to the club from @entity127 in 1987 - some felt @entity1 was a surprising choice as manager considering he had just led his previous club to relegation @entity1 , flanked by midfielders @entity165 ( left ) and @entity166 ( right ) , holds the @entity10 trophy aloft in 1991 - @entity4 beat @entity75 in the final at the @entity169 after substitute @entity170 scored the only goal of the game in the 90th minute wenger is lifted onto the shoulders of a @entity4 player by @entity90 and @entity165 in @entity175 after his domestic cup success - it was the last trophy that @entity1 won while in charge of the club , although he came close to winning others in the seasons that followed wenger talks to @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity186 legend @entity185 ; the two men shared a philosophy of attacking football in their managerial careers - at @entity4 this was represented by players such as @entity14 , @entity193 and @entity90 @entity195 - born @entity26 defender @entity194 ( left ) , @entity196 legend @entity90 ( centre left ) , assistant coach @entity141 ( centre right ) and manager @entity1 ( right ) celebrate after beating @entity200 during the @entity26 's second season in charge of the club wenger smoking on the bench while in charge at @entity4 ; he said of the habit : ' i never smoked a lot and never when i played but when i became a young coach i had an assistant who smoked and , at 3am in the morning when you have lost a big game , i might have one ' wenger hugs coach @entity141 in 1994 it what what turned out to be his final year at the club , and his final year in @entity9 - he headed to @entity11 to join @entity217 for the 1995 - 96 season before being brought to @entity12 to take charge of @entity7 @entity1 and @entity220 in august 1994 , just one month before he was sacked as manager of @entity4 - @entity220 was , at the time , manager of the @entity26 army team but had previously had spells in charge of @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity175 @entity1 and @entity141 in the dugout in 1990 - @entity230 had three separate spells as assistant manager at @entity4 that were punctuated by two brief periods as caretaker manager , including after @entity1 was sacked by the @entity9 club in 1994 @entity1 's time at the club may have ended on a sour note with the his arguments over corruption in the league and his eventual sacking by the club , but @entity4 fans will look back fondly on his tenure after he brought them a league title , the @entity26 cup and two @entity249 finals between his appointment on july 1 1987 and his sacking in on september 17 1994 , @entity1 took charge of 266 games at @entity4 - he won 130 , drew 53 and lost 83 , giving him a win ratio of 48.87 per cent during his time there , which was 20 per cent better than his time at @entity127			1
