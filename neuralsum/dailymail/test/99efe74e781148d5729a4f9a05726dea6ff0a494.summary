aside from making a fighter jet lightweight , agile and astonishingly fast , engineers of one the world 's most advanced aircraft have another , more surprising issue to contend with : the moon			1
@entity7 's @entity6 is so accurate that even the movements of the tide can disrupt the jet fighter 's positioning and accuracy			1
to counteract even the slightest shifts in gravitational pull , experts must build the jet on ' floating ' concrete rafts that move in sync with the moon			1
the @entity6 ( pictured ) is powered by two @entity20 engines			2
it is 49ft ( 15 metres ) long from tip to tip and the material is ' no more than the thickness of a match stick			0
' this helps its ‘ fly by wire ’ computer system to accurately control the aircraft , designed to be unstable but hugely agile these rafts measure 59ft ( 18 metres ) long and 9.8ft ( 3 metres ) thick and are used to house the measuring equipment			1
two laser trackers and nine jacks are positioned on a single surface , to make sure all movement is relative , and they control the alignment of the barges by cancelling out the subtle effects of the moon and the tides it creates			1
this means the jet will be in ' near perfect alignment whatever the moon may be doing , ' said @entity44 , @entity45			2
' every time the moon pulls the tide in and out , the ground under our feet actually moves by between one and two millimetres , he continued			0

' this helps its ‘ fly by wire ’ computer system to accurately control the aircraft , designed to be unstable but hugely agile , and this build accuracy can save enough fuel to fill up an average family car , or around 60 litres			1
the @entity6 can take off in less than 8 seconds , achieve supersonic speeds in under 30 seconds and reach altitudes of 36,000 feet @entity64 1.6 in under two and a half minutes			1
it is able to pull up to @entity66 , which creates a pressure equivalent to 30 african elephants			2

' that might not sound a lot , but given the tolerances we are working to on @entity6 , two millimetres is two millimetres too much			2
' @entity90 - based @entity89 paid £ 2.5 million ( $ 3.7 million ) for this setup and said the ' result is one of the most perfectly aligned fast jet airframes in the world			1

elsewhere , the @entity6 can take off in less than 8 seconds , achieve supersonic speeds in under 30 seconds and reach altitudes of 36,000 feet @entity64 1.6 in under two and a half minutes			1
it takes light from the @entity113 eight minutes to reach @entity114 and the firm said the @entity6 can travel from @entity116 to @entity117 in the same time			1
and it can fly from @entity119 to @entity120 - a total of 603 miles ( 970km ) - in under 30 mins			2
it is able to pull up to @entity66 , which creates a pressure on the wings equivalent to 30 african elephants			2
and pilots fly with the @entity128 helmet			2
facing directly into the sun , or even when it 's dark , their location as well as potential threats are shown on this helmet 's visor , and pilots can see thermal images through the use of @entity138			0

it also lets pilots ' see ' enemy aircraft through the body of the plane			1
a radar in the nose detects enemy aircraft and projects its image to the pilot 's visor the helmet is wired to the plane to let pilots lock onto targets with ' just a look ' and a voice command			0
it also lets pilots ' see ' enemy aircraft through the body of the plane			1
for example , a radar in the nose of the @entity6 detects enemy aircraft hidden from the pilot 's view			0
as the pilot looks towards the position of the enemy aircraft , its image is projected on the visor			0
they can then lock - on to the aircraft by voice command , which means the enemy is also tracked by the aircraft 's weapons systems			0
sensors on the helmet ' talk ' to the fixed sensors on the aircraft so the @entity6 always knows exactly where the pilot is looking			2
weapons sensors on the @entity6 track enemy aircraft and missile information and feed it back to the plane , which is directly wired to the helmet			2
. @entity90 - based @entity89 paid £ 2.5 million ( $ 3.7 million ) for this setup ( pictured ) and said the ' result is one of the most perfectly aligned fast jet airframes in the world ' sensors on the helmet ( pictured ) ' talk ' to the fixed sensors on the aircraft so the @entity6 always knows exactly where the pilot is looking			1
weapons sensors on the @entity6 track enemy aircraft and missile information and feed it back to the plane inside the cockpit , @entity89 has designed lighting that is clear and legible at all times			0
the company 's @entity226 in @entity228 is specifically designed to replicate the full range of lighting conditions of each journey			0
this specialised facility has been used by firms that make displays for bank atm machines as part of a group called @entity239			0

a parachute is inside the ejector seat on the aircraft			0
and to reduce pilot workload , the @entity6 has a @entity275 ( @entity276 ) system which means the pilot can keep his hand on the throttle and operate the majority of the aircraft ’s controls from this position			1
additional commands can be given through voice activation			0
it is worn as part of the @entity6 jet fighter pilot 's suit			1
in this suit there is a single connection to ' feed the pilot ' with air , oxygen and radio connection and the suit 's trousers inflate to counteract the loss of blood from the head to the feet when the aircraft hits g force			0

to counteract shifts in gravitational pull , engineers build @entity6 on ' floating ' concrete rafts with laser trackers and computer - *automated* jacks
this £ 2.5 million system means the jet is accurately aligned
elsewhere , the jet fighter can reach supersonic speeds in 30 seconds
and the @entity6 helmet lets pilots ' see ' through the bottom of the jet
