the @entity1 emergency - room doctor who initially treated a @entity3 man infected with @entity4 has said he did n't know the man 's home country or that he had a 103 - degree fever shortly before he left the hospital			1

patient : @entity10 was released in the early hours of september 26 , about half an hour after his medical records indicate he had a fever that high - a key potential symptom of @entity4 ' i was unaware of a 103 - degree fever , ' @entity14 said in written answers to questions released by his attorney			1
' it appears in the chart , but i did not see it			0
' @entity10 returned to @entity29 two days later in an ambulance and was quickly diagnosed with @entity4			1
@entity10 's sister and fiancee have said he told medical staff in the emergency room during that first visit that he was from @entity3 , though the hospital 's medical records only indicate @entity10 said he was from @entity38 , the @entity9 reported			1
' i have a general recollection of mr. @entity10 , but i do n’t recall the specifics of our discussions , ' @entity14 told the newspaper , answering a question about if he spoke to @entity10 regarding travel history			2
' however , i routinely pair the recent travel question with the sick contact question so it is likely that i did so in this instance			0
' the hospital has already acknowledged mistakes in its care of @entity10 and said its records system previously did n't make a patient 's travel history clear , the newspaper pointed out			2
@entity10 's case set off a scramble by authorities to monitor dozens of people who potentially had contact with him , including in the days after his release from the hospital			1
none of those people ended up testing positive for @entity4			0
two presbyterian nurses were infected while treating him , but have since recovered			0
@entity69 , center , mother of @entity10 , is comforted during a memorial service for her son on october 18 hospital : dr. @entity74 treated @entity10 at @entity29 , pictured ( file photo ) in his written responses to the @entity9 , @entity14 also said ' as medical professionals we aspire to perfection in the diagnosis and treatment of all our patients and have regrets when an incorrect diagnosis occurs			2
' ' it ’s very easy to make a diagnosis of any condition after the patient ’s medical evaluation confirms the final diagnosis , ' he said			0
' unfortunately , such 20/20 hindsight is not available to medical professionals caring for patients in real time			0
' @entity14 said ' if [ @entity10 ] told me he came from @entity3 , this would have prompted me to contact the @entity96 and begin an evaluation for @entity4 , but the likelihood would have still been low since mr. @entity10 denied any sick contacts			1
' but he was less sure about the 103 - degree reading			2
' given what little information i had , a 103 temperature would most likely not have helped with the diagnosis of @entity4 , ' @entity14 said			2
' although , if it did not quickly improve , he could have possibly been admitted to the hospital			0
' asked about whether he would do anything differently , @entity14 told the @entity9 that ' hindsight is always 20/20 so it ’s virtually impossible to answer this question			0
based on the information i had at the time , i believe that the care and treatment were appropriate			0
