@entity33 gangs and criminals operating in the @entity35 of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 are also suspected of involvement , industry sources suggest			0
environment secretary @entity40 as also raised concerns that a worldwide criminal network is behind the scandal			1
@entity44 , a @entity21 - wide agency tackling organised crime and terrorism , has been informed , while the government is looking to bring in the @entity48			0
the @entity49 has already begun investigating and is said to be working with other forces on the continent			0
mr @entity40 said : ' i 'm concerned that this is an international criminal conspiracy here and we 've really got to get to the bottom of it			1
' his comments come just days after frozen foods company @entity59 @entity9 revealed it had discovered horsemeat in its beef lasagne and has suggested it was deliberately contaminated			1
the meat was supplied by @entity64 firm @entity63 and is thought to have originated in @entity65			1
authorities in the country are investigating whether an abattoir there was the source of the meat			0
global : @entity40 raised fears that a worldwide ' criminal conspiracy is behind the scandal ' it has also emerged that wild horses in @entity65 were slaughtered after suffering appalling cruelty , and there are fears that they were then shipped to @entity9 as beef products			1
investigators in the eastern @entity21 country have been searching sales records following the revelations that the stolen animals were mistreated on their way to abattoirs			2
in one case , more than 50 horses were found inside a truck on its way to an abattoir in @entity93 , which is understood to have exported meat			2
four of the animals were dead and others were barely alive , having been beaten with crowbars and starved of food and water for 28 hours			1
they are thought to have been caught from the @entity100 in the @entity101 , where thousands of wild horses roam			1
a source close to the investigation told @entity105 : ' the meat from this racket would almost certainly have been sent abroad and there 's no telling where it would have wound up			0
' you only have to look at the state of the poor animals to realise that the meat would have been of terrible quality and possibly unfit for human consumption			2
' testing of processed beef products , including those being supplied to hospitals , care homes , schools and prisons , was stepped up in @entity9			1
results from the testing for horse dna will be published by the @entity127 on friday			1
mr @entity40 warned they could reveal further traces of horsemeat , but stressed there is no evidence that the scandal has become a public safety issue			0
he said : ' there may well be more bad results coming through , that 's the point of doing this random analysis			2
mr @entity40 said retailers have agreed plans to improve their food testing , adding that they hold the ' ultimate responsibility ' for making sure their products do not contain horse meat			1
he was speaking after attending an emergency meeting with bosses from leading supermarkets , including @entity149 , @entity150 's , @entity151 and @entity152 , trade bodies and the @entity127			2
cruel : wild horses abused and slaughtered in @entity65 may have been ended up in the @entity9 ( library image ) a law banning horses from @entity65 roads may be responsible for the surge in the fraudulent sale of horse meat on the @entity21 beef market , a @entity64 politician has claimed			1
horse - drawn carts were a common form of transport for centuries in @entity65 , but hundreds of thousands of the animals are feared to have been sent to the abattoir after the change in road rules			1
the law , which was passed six years ago but only enforced recently , also banned carts drawn by donkeys , leading to speculation among food - industry officials in @entity176 that some of the ' horse meat ' which has turned up on supermarket shelves in @entity9 , @entity176 and @entity180 may , in fact , turn out to be donkey meat ' horses have been banned from @entity65 roads and millions of animals have been sent to the slaughterhouse , ' said @entity186 , a veteran campaigner for small farmers who is now vice-president of the @entity189 agriculture committee			1
the scandal has seen chains @entity149 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 withdraw some products , and mr @entity40 said the industry has already begun plans to report test results on a quarterly basis			1

they had also agreed that consumers should be compensated if they have bought withdrawn products with no questions asked , he said			2
mr @entity40 added : ' it 's a question of either gross incompetence , but as i 've said publicly and i 'll repeat again , i 'm more concerned there 's actually an international criminal conspiracy here , and we 've really got to get to the bottom of it			1
' if there 's a criminal act we will work with the authorities wherever they are to ensure the appropriate measures are taken			2
' this is a conspiracy against the public			0
selling a product as beef , and including a lot of horse in it is fraud			1
' asked if there were any plans to test for traces of other meats , such as dog , he replied : ' it may be very isolated , it might be a small number of suppliers involved in the horse trade we do n't know			0
investigation : authorities are investigating of @entity245 , at the centre of the horsemeat scandal ' but i think that as we progress and we 'll know more over the course of the next few weeks , we can decide what to do next			0
' he also said a ban on importing meat would not be allowed within the rules of the @entity256 but could be brought in if beef contaminated with horse meat is found to be a health risk			1
although no danger to humans has yet been found in eating the horsemeat so far detected , mr @entity40 said that if further tests find it does pose a risk he would ' take the necessary action '			0
initial findings : horsemeat from @entity65 was sold to a meat plant in @entity176 owned by @entity64 firm @entity245 , which then supplied @entity63 the @entity127 said there is no evidence to suggest the horsemeat is a food safety risk but confirmed that tests have been ordered on products for the veterinary drug phenylbutazone as animals treated with ' bute ' are not allowed to enter the food chain			1
mr @entity40 , appearing on @entity281 's @entity280 , said : ' this week obviously we 'll be talking to counterparts across @entity21 , because ultimately this is @entity256 incompetence			0
' but asked if there should be a moratorium on meat imports in the @entity256 , he said : ' that is not allowed within the @entity21 common market			0
' if they find there is a product which could potentially be injurious to public health , emphatically , i will take the necessary action			0
' asked if he would consider a ban if tests proved there was a food safety risk , he said : ' if there is a threat to public health that is allowed within the rules of the @entity21 market			0
' prime minister @entity306 described the matter as ' shocking ' and ' completely unacceptable ' , while @entity309 leader @entity308 said it was ' appalling '			0
he added : ' i think people in the country will be quite shocked that horsemeat has been in the food that they have been innocently buying			0
the government has got to get a grip on this situation			0
' the @entity318 has said the discovery of such high levels of horse meat suggests ' deliberate fraudulent activity '			0
not hungry : food minister @entity323 ( left ) turns down a @entity59 meal from @entity326 man @entity325 food safety experts have said there is no risk to public health			1

@entity149 and @entity193 have also withdrawn a range of ready meals produced by @entity63 over fears that they contained contaminated meat			0
