ministers will announce a major climbdown on fracking today as they bring in strict controls to protect vast swathes of the @entity6 countryside			1
shale gas development will be all but banned in @entity8 and other protected countryside – and permitted only in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			1
the move from the @entity12 is likely to be seen as an attempt to head off a potential revolt in @entity15 over fracking in the run up to next year ’s election			1
carried away : police remove a protester from a fracking site			2
today ti will be announced the controversial process is to be curbed it was welcomed by countryside protection groups yesterday – but will cause dismay among industry and pro-fracking groups , who say the controversial method will cut energy bills , create jobs and deliver decades of energy security			1
the move tears up bolder suggestions from ministers last year that more than 40 per cent of @entity6 could be opened up for fracking – as the restricted areas cover huge parts of the county , especially in the @entity41 heartlands of @entity42			2
the announcement is in sharp contrast to the rhetoric of former energy minister @entity46 , who was moved to @entity47 in this month ’s reshuffle			0
last year he said fracking would take place in vast swathes of ‘ @entity52 all the way along @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , all the way perhaps a bit into @entity60 and even into my county of @entity63			1
’ unrest : pressure groups have fought vociferously against fracking			2
pictured above is a protest in @entity68 , @entity57 he added : ‘ we are going to see how thick their rectory walls are , whether they like the flaring at the end of the drive ! ’ last night new energy minister @entity76 said : ‘ the new guidance published today will protect @entity6 ’s great national parks and outstanding landscapes			0
’ the rules will apply to all @entity8 , @entity81 , world heritage sites and the @entity83 and @entity84			0
natural beauty areas make up one fifth of @entity6 ’s countryside , and national parks 10 per cent of the land area in @entity90			2
in these areas fracking would only be allowed in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ and when it was clearly in the public interest , @entity12 said			1
if , as it appears , fracking is severely limited in these areas , it would put a new focus on development in @entity99			1
a report last year suggested @entity101 in @entity102 could contain 1,300trillion cubic feet of gas which could provide for @entity6 ’s energy needs for decades			2
drilling : proponents of fracking claim is will slash bills , create jobs and deliver energy security fracking has already proved to be hugely controversial , sparking protests in @entity68 in @entity57			1
ministers also said that planning appeals would be called in by the communities secretary @entity115 to ensure the rules are being closely observed over the next year			0
applications for licences to develop onshore oil and gas in or near the sensitive areas will also have to include new environmental awareness studies			0
@entity123 : former energy minister @entity46 was in favour of fracking more widely @entity127 sources insisted the rules did not amount to a ban on fracking in @entity8			0
one said it would put fracking on the same footing as onshore wind farms			0
the industry is expected to react badly to the announcement , which is made today as ministers invite new bids for licences to develop shale gas			1
around 150 licences are expected to be granted			0
once it is approved , a developer will also have to secure local planning permission before drilling can start			0
energy investors are likely to see the @entity127 guidance as a tide of red tape which could slow or inhibit shale development			1
but local communities and some @entity41 activists will welcome the shift away from fracking in their areas			0
@entity152 , of the @entity153 , said ‘ change in rhetoric is very welcome ’ , adding : ‘ the government has previously stoked opposition by giving the impression that it is committed to fracking whatever the consequence and however sensitive the location			0
‘ if fracking is to happen , we need to proceed with great caution and with the highest possible safeguards			0
’ a @entity166 spokesman said : ‘ we hope it will reflect a much more cautious approach that recognises the risks of turning some of the most special places in the country over to industrial scale extraction of shale gas and oil			1

shale gas development will be banned in protected countryside
controversial process will now only be allowed in ' exceptional ' situations
attempts to start fracking in @entity55 drew the *wrath* of *thousands*
*turnaround* for @entity154 will be seen as attempt to placate *voters*
