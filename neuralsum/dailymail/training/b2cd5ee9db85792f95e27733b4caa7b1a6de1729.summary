' @entity0 , who also played for @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , appeared in court today in connection with two speeding offences and was handed a 34 week driving disqualification , although it was suspended pending an appeal by his lawyer			1

the court also heard how he has sold his car and is in negative equity on his mortgage			1
@entity0 was pulled over in a @entity27 courtesy car in @entity28 , @entity29 , doing 140mph on february 2			1
three weeks earlier he had been stopped doing 88mph on january 17			1
both offences took place on the same stretch of the @entity34 dual carriageway			1
the court heard that , having been through an ' acrimonious and bitter ' divorce with his wife and subsequent battle to see his two daughters , aged two and four , he had driven at speed on his return journey from @entity43 where they lived with their mother			1
@entity45 , prosecuting , said : ' at approximately 22.49 the officer was travelling along the @entity34 northbound			2
there was a vehicle travelling in lane one and then another vehicle in lane two in excess of 70mph			0
' travelling in lane two was a black @entity27 saloon			0
the @entity27 pulled away from the officer 's car			0
' the @entity27 travelled along the @entity34 at 140pm for 1.5 miles			2
he was driving at double the 70mph speed limit			2
' ' the marked police car then pulled @entity0 over and having been told he had been stopped due to speeding he replied " i was just trying to get home			1
" ' @entity61 , representing @entity0 , said : ' @entity0 is a retired footballer			2
he was the former goalkeeper with a number of clubs including @entity4 , @entity9 and most recently @entity11 and it was when he was at @entity11 that this offence was committed			0
' whilst at @entity11 unfortunately his marriage broke up and because of this it placed him in a difficult situation			0
the goalkeeper was at @entity11 , when the offences took place on the @entity34 dual carriageway in @entity28 , @entity29 ' he absolutely dotes on his two girls and if it was n't for that fact he wanted to maintain a relationship with these girls , this would never have happened			1
' the court heard that following a costly divorce with his wife he had to go to court numerous times to fight for access to the girls			1
mr @entity61 added : ' to see the girls he had to come up to @entity43 where they were living with his former wife			2
it is right to say the divorce is extremely traumatic because everything was argued about			2
' @entity0 is also set to go to trial after his wife filed a section 4 harassment case against him			1
mr @entity61 continued : ' it is talking about the high end of harassment and there is going to be a trial in relation to that			0
he absolutely denies the fact of being involved in any harassment			0
' he admits both parties have not covered themselves in glory			0
it is an acrimonious and bitter divorce			1
many court cases have been enormously expensive			2
he is also receiving @entity104 - that 's how bad it 's got			0
' ' he has fought and fought for custody of his children			2
' he was travelling from @entity29 to @entity43 because it had to be him who did the transfer with the children			1
@entity0 , who formerly played for @entity4 , said he drove at speed because he was just ' trying to get home ' ' after one of these visits on his way back to @entity29 he was going far too fast			1
' @entity0 , who has now moved back to @entity117 , drives his mother 's @entity118 , the court was told			1
mr @entity61 said : ' he is in negative equity with his property			0
there are no savings , nothing to rely on			0
in order to keep his relationship going which he is desperate to do he has to pick the girls up from where they are living near @entity131			0
" his mother has to pick them up			0
that would not have been a problem because until recently she could drive so she could pick her son up , then the children , transfer them back to him which happens at least twice a week			2
' however on september 2 her vision was tested and it was discovered that her eyesight was below the driving standard			0
he can no longer rely on his mum			0
' the court heard how @entity0 had to drive a 50 mile round trip to see his daughters and that any disqualification would hamper his ability to visit them the court also heard that @entity0 now had to drive a 50 mile round trip to see his daughters and that any disqualification would hamper his ability to visit them it also heard how he is now intending to do his coaching badges in november in a course at @entity155 , the national football centre			1
the court was told the goalkeeper already incurred nine points on his driving licence for two previous speeding offences in march 2013 in which he received an £ 800 fine and six points and another in 2013 in which he received a fixed penalty			1
the chair of the bench , @entity167 , said : ' because of the level of the 140mph offence and taking into account the circumstances in which it took place we really have no alternative but to impose a discretionary disqualification immediately			0
' this speed in fact goes way off the scale of our guidelines so we feel we have no alternative to impost the discretionary disqualification for a period of 34 weeks			1
for the other offence it will be a concurrent disqualification of six weeks			0
' ' we have to take account of your very limited means			0
if it were not for this the financial penalty would have been a lot higher			0
' @entity0 was ordered to pay £ 400 in total , £ 210 for the speeding offences and another £ 170 for court costs and a £ 20 victim surcharge			1
he will pay the fine immediately however his lawyer appealed the disqualification			0
speaking after the case mr @entity61 said : ' we are appealing because it is too long and unfair			2

just three weeks earlier he had been stopped doing 88mph on same road
@entity1 heard he had been speeding when returning from visiting his children
