police say the large - scale operation allowed @entity3 and his gangsters to live ' quite affluent ' lives			2
but even though officers seized around £ 100,000 during their investigations , the hearing could only prove that @entity3 personally made £ 63,163 from his crimes			1
officers had used @entity3 and his fellow criminals as the faces of a poster campaign to tell residents that ' crime does n't pay ' after they were sentenced to a combined total of 167 years behind bars			2
