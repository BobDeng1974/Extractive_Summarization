e-readers may be a relatively new phenomenon but historians claim a @entity4 teacher first came up with the idea more than 60 years ago			1
forward - thinking @entity6 invented her @entity7 in 1949 - more than half a century before the advent of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
her main goal was to reduce the weight of books in students ' school bags , and she firmly believed the gadget would make reading more accessible to all			1
@entity19 : @entity6 invented her @entity7 in 1949 - some half a century before the @entity21 , @entity10 and @entity11 literature lovers enjoy today the device worked with pressurised air , allowing readers to add different spools containing the pre-loaded content			1
it may be well away from the current format of downloading books from the internet , but in a world without the web it was deemed revolutionary			2
@entity34 , who was at the time aged 54 , applied for a patent			2
her rather concise application said : ' it has some coils where you place the books that you want to learn in whatever language			2
' by a movement of the same [ the coils ] it passes over all the topics , making it stop where you would like it to			2
' it also reportedly had a ' zoom ' function where readers could focus in on a particular area of the text			1
@entity55 , language professor at the @entity56 , said she also had plans to add a reading light , sound and a hole to place a calculator			1
but none of these ideas made it to the first prototype			0
@entity6 ' technology was a million miles away from the e-readers we have today , such as the @entity69 , but the core concept was the same sadly , the mother - of - three 's invention never reached the market as she could not find the right level of funding for her project			1
@entity77 told @entity4 media : ' there were other priorities in the country and they went for other projects			0
' furthermore , the implementation of all the specifications of the invention was impractical			0
' in her later years @entity6 tried to resurrect the project , when everything was technologically viable			1
but she did not manage to secure public or private funding			0
' @entity34 , born in 1895 in @entity88 , @entity89 , moved to the town of @entity91 in @entity92 as a youngster where she spent most of her life			0
she died in her 80s			0
the prototype is now in the @entity98 in @entity99 , whose director @entity100 said that @entity34 was ' unique , not only in @entity4 , but in the world			0
' he added : ' it is easy to see that there are very few women who have dared to enter their ideas for inventions and innovations			0
' for her exceptional character , the fact that she is not well known is very serious			0

@entity6 invented the ' @entity7 '
the device used spools and pressurised air and even had a ' zoom ' feature
she had plans to add sound , a reading light and a calculator
but she could not find financial backing for her innovative project
