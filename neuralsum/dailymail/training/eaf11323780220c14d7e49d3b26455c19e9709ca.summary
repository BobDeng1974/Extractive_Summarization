pointless : @entity0 said holding a vote for lifting the ban with such strong opposition would be a waste of time the ban on hunting with dogs will not be overturned , @entity6 chairman @entity0 declared yesterday			1
speaking on the day that a quarter of a million supporters turned out for @entity11 hunts , he said there was no chance of getting the majority needed to scrap @entity16 's law			1
earlier , environment secretary @entity17 said he was not expecting a vote in 2013 , because it was clear the government would lose			2
and yesterday the outspoken new head of the @entity22 , @entity23 , taunted @entity24 on his failure to bring forward a vote on fox hunting – telling him it was because he knows he will lose			1
the prime minister had pledged a free vote in the @entity30 on reversing the ban on fox hunting before the 2015 election			1
but almost three years into his coalition , no vote has yet been timetabled			2
a poll , released yesterday , found that 76 per cent of the public are against moves to legalise fox hunting			2
the @entity40 survey also found that 81 per cent oppose deer hunting			2
mr @entity0 said : ' as @entity17 said , it makes sense to bring something forward if you think there 's a chance of there being a parliamentary majority			1
' at the moment there does n't appear to be one			0
' but mr @entity23 said that mr @entity24 still had two and a half years to make good on his pledge to hold a vote on overturning the hunting ban			1
the former pr man , who seems determined to make the @entity22 more political , said : ' it is in the @entity35 agreement and this government seem intent upon enacting the coalition agreement line by line so i think we 've got to assume it will come , ' he said			0
' it 's great to see the @entity35 bringing forward legislation to grant gay people the same rights to marriage as straight people , so the notion that at the same time we could reintroduce something that was seen as appropriate in the 19th century and very inappropriate in the 20th century is absolutely bizarre			0
' if the prime minister feels he wants to have his vote then let him have his vote			2
he will discover that he 's going to lose and maybe that 's necessary to end this discussion about the @entity78			0
' earlier this month , the @entity22 successfully took the @entity79 in @entity80 – whose previous riders include the prime minister – to court for illegally killing foxes			0
the battle cost £ 330,000 , an enormous sum from the @entity22 's depleted coffers			0
the hunt itself was only fined £ 4,000			0
no vote : mr @entity0 ' comments on the vote to lift the hunting ban comes on one of the biggest hunting days of the year - @entity11 - where many hunting parties set out with dogs despite the ban mr @entity23 has also taken on the @entity99 over the badger cull			1
he appeared to call for a milk boycott aimed at dairy farmers who had shot the animals on their land – but he later retracted this			0
he has also attacked the @entity106 for being cruel to horses , going further than any previous @entity22 chief in calling for the removal of the notorious @entity111 fence			0
mr @entity23 's confidence on keeping the hunting ban in place was matched by mr @entity17 's indication that moves to repeal it may not happen next year			1
no dogs allowed : using dogs as part of fox hunts have been made illegal , with drag hunts still permitted , but many @entity6 mps want the ban lifted no need to vote : environment secretary @entity17 argued that a vote could only be justified when there is a chance of parliamentary majority in favour of the issue the minister said : ' there 's only a point having a vote if you 're going to win			1
' at the moment , it would not be my proposal to bring forward a vote we were going to lose			2
there needs to be more work done on members of @entity145			0
' he added : ' it is our clear intention to have a free vote but we need to choose an appropriate moment			2
' @entity152 , @entity6 mp for @entity153 and @entity154 , warned mr @entity24 he could lose vital rural votes if he does not table a vote			1
he said : ' we are only two - and - a - half years into a five - year parliament , there is plenty of time to deal with this			0
' i 'm confident that we 've got a strong commitment from the pm and he knows that he 's made a promise on this ; he knows he ca n't really afford to let down core voters in rural constituencies			0
' @entity16 's environment spokesman @entity168 said : ' most people back @entity16 's ban on hunting wild animals with dogs			1
' people are worried about their incomes falling , prices rising and losing their jobs , yet this out of touch @entity6 - led government wants to bring back hunting			1
' the @entity181 said it had seen no slackening of support for hunting in recent years			0
but executive chairman sir @entity185 admitted now may not be the best time for a @entity30 vote			1
' if you were going to go for some sort of repeal then it would probably take a ... huge amount of parliamentary time at a time when the @entity195 and @entity145 's got other priorities , ' he said .			0
