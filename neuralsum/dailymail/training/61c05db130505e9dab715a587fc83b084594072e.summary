by @entity0 extradited : @entity2 soldier @entity1 , 43 , who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder , has lost his appeal fighting extradition to the @entity6 a @entity2 soldier suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder has lost his legal challenge against extradition to the @entity6 where he is wanted on fraud charges			1
@entity1 , 43 , who served in @entity13 , was given additional time by home secretary @entity15 to present evidence of his illness to @entity19 's @entity18 in a bid to stand trial in @entity2			1
but despite being ' at high risk of suicide ' , he was today told the medical notes were not enough to block his removal			0
in an irreversible ruling , mr @entity1 , who also served in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , now faces eight counts of fraud and a possible 20 - year jail term in an @entity6 prison			1
the fraud case concerns a contract between mr @entity1 's security firm @entity36 and the @entity37			1
it is alleged that @entity39 overcharged the institute by $ 100,000 ( £ 66,000 ) when providing security for the group in @entity28 during a break from army service			1
the former soldier insists he is innocent and is the victim of a plea bargain in which a @entity6 official , accused of similar offences , named him to secure a lenient sentence			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity51 , served with the @entity52 from 1996 to 2002			2
when he left , he set up his company to provide security to @entity6 clients , including the @entity28 ambassador to the @entity6			1
but in 2009 he closed the business and enrolled in the @entity58			0
he was serving in @entity59 , @entity13 , when the allegations emerged in july 2012 , forcing him to be discharged and flown home			2
despite two years of legal battles , and a military psychiatric report warning extradition could have ' potentially tragic ' consequences , he has now been told he will be sent to the @entity6			2
and lord chief justice lord @entity66 said there was ' no conceivable basis ' on which he could appeal this latest ruling in the @entity70			0
blasting the sentence as ' cruel ' , friends extradited spokesman @entity72 told @entity73 : ruling : lord chief justice lord @entity66 ruled there was ' no injustice ' in the case at @entity19 's @entity18 ' @entity1 is somebody who has served his country all of his life and as a result of what he has seen is suffering from @entity83			2
' i think it is cruel and unnecessary to extradite him			0
' we have the facilities to investigate the alleged overcharging of £ 66,000 without putting him through the added trauma of automatically locking him up , separating him from his partner , his kids , his home			1
' i am also not persuaded that the @entity6 justice system takes sufficient care of people with mental health problems			0
' ' @entity1 has served his country all his life			2
it is cruel and unnecessary to put him through the trauma of separating him from his partner , kids , and home ' - @entity72 , friends extradited at the march hearing , @entity103 , for @entity39 , argued there was convincing medical evidence that he was suffering from a mental disorder and it would violate his human rights if extradition went ahead because of the suicide risk			0
he suggested @entity39 could stand trial in the @entity2			0
the @entity6 authorities opposed the bid to block removal			0
@entity39 ’s supporters say of the extradition threat : ' is this really the way @entity2 should be treating its brave soldiers ?
