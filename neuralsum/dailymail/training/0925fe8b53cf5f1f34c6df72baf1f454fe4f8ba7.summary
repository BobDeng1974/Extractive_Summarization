a curious new natural dietary supplement , most comparable to molasses , has been declared by @entity2 as a powerful weight loss aid and a ' metabolism gamer changer ' , because it ' lowers hunger hormones			1
' yacon syrup was recently road tested by the dr @entity8 , and 73 per cent of the 40 women who trialed it lost weight - an average 2.9 lbs - simply by consuming one teaspoon of the mild sweetener with every meal for four weeks , and changing nothing else about their lifestyles			1
the fiber - packed syrup , extracted from the @entity19 yacon root , is high in a compound called @entity21 ; a digestion supporting prebiotic which feeds healthy gut bacteria and supposedly helps you feel full , at only 20 calories per tablespoon			1
miracle goop ? @entity28 ( pictured ) has been touted by @entity2 as an effective weight - loss aid and a ' metabolism game changer '			1
it is high in fiber and digestion - supportive prebiotic @entity21 agents @entity28 , which is said to taste like raisins , is actually nothing new - it 's been around since @entity36 times and people in @entity38 and @entity39 have long touted it as a good low - sugar food that can help with diabetes , digestive problems and even kidney disorders			2
as for rock - solid scientific evidence on yacon syrup 's benefits , there is n't much beyond dr @entity2 's trial			1
only one small study which was published in @entity51 in 2009 , and found that obese women did experience ' a significant decrease in weight , cholesterol and insulin levels ' after taking the syrup three times a day for four months			2
but do n't get too excited			0
the women were also instructed to walk for 45 minutes a day and reduce their caloric intake , which appears to rather defeat the point of that particular exercise			0
and in the case of dr @entity2 's study , the weight loss attributed to yacon syrup could also be down to a common diet - test phenomenon whereby research subjects subconsciously make better food choices while they are under the microscope - even when they are instructed not to change their lifestyles in any other way			1
to the test : dr @entity2 ( center ) got 40 women ( pictured ) to take one teaspoon of yacon syrup with every meal for four months and reported that 73 per cent of them lost weight , an average 2.9lbs a quick @entity81 search on the top - selling brand of @entity28 turns up generally good reviews from those who have tried it			1
@entity28 syrup is a thick , molasses - like substance which can be used as a low - calorie natural sweetener and as a diet supplement			0
it is high is fiber and fructooligosaccharides ( @entity21 ) - which are prebiotic , non-digestible carbohydrates that act as food for healthy gut bacteria			0
the syrup is said to help with weight loss by regulating blood - sugar levels , reducing appetite and making you full , at only 20 calories per tablespoon			2
' like many , i bought this after seeing the @entity2 segment			0
it did work for me , as i lost three lbs after a month of taking the yacon syrup , ' one customer writes , although she points out that there are ' cheaper alternatives ' of foods rich in @entity21			0
nineteen out of the 205 reviews were negative however , with one customer warning : ' this product was touted as being a stabilizing influence on blood sugar ... but it was just the opposite			0
' another writes : ' i took it morning and evening and gained ten pounds			0
my blood sugar went out of control			0
' of course , while often helpful , reviews - much like the advice of @entity2 , as history dictates - should be taken with a pinch of salt			2
@entity128 asked @entity129 and @entity132 - based nutritionist @entity130 for her lowdown			2
' to say that yacon syrup will assist with weight loss is generous , but not totally bogus ' , she says , but adds that the syrup is a ' promising sugar alternative '			1
natural form : the yacon root ( pictured ) has been consumed by people in countries like @entity38 and @entity39 for centuries , to aid with ailments including diabetes , digestive problems and kidney disorders the benefits of digestion - boosting fos are certainly plentiful , ms @entity148 claims : ' gut health translates to overall health , so a robust flora ecosystem is essential for preventing inflammation and boosting intestinal immunity			1
it 's also high in soluble fiber , which helps people feel full , and assists in mediating the body â€™s blood glucose response after a meal			0
' ' to say that yacon syrup will assist with weight loss is generous , but not totally bogus ' she did warn however , that because yacon passes through the intestines largely undigested : ' it can be harsh on the gastro - intestinal tract , especially in people with inflammatory bowel conditions , and may cause gas '			1
the consensus then appears to be that at best , yacon syrup may indeed assist with healthy weight loss , and at worst , it could have unwanted side effects			2
on balance however , its natural health properties do seem to outweigh the possible risks and , whether or not it truly works as a diet aid on its own , it makes for a good low - calorie sweetener .			0

in dr @entity2 's trial on 40 women , 73 per cent lost an average on 2.9lbs , without otherwise changing their lifestyles
an *independent* nutritional expert told @entity128 that weight - loss claims are ' generous ' but ' not totally bogus '
the yacon root has been consumed in @entity19 for centuries
