@entity1 motorsport boss @entity0 believes @entity2 was back to his best in sunday 's @entity4			2
@entity2 has again found himself playing second fiddle to @entity6 so far this season , which has led to many questioning his character and ability			2
although @entity2 could only finish third behind @entity6 and @entity11 star @entity10 at the @entity12 , he proved over the course of the race he still has what it takes			1
@entity2 duels for position with the @entity11 of @entity18 during sunday 's race in @entity12 @entity6 sprays @entity2 with champagne after the @entity21 secured his third win in four races this term 1			1
@entity6 ( @entity25 ) @entity1 93 2			0
@entity2 ( @entity26 ) @entity1 66 3			2
@entity18 ( @entity26 ) @entity11 65 4			2
@entity10 ( @entity27 ) @entity11 42 @entity2 conjured three superb overtaking manoeuvres , one on @entity10 and two on the @entity30 's @entity11 team - mate @entity18			1
a delighted @entity0 said : ' everybody who ever doubted @entity2 saw @entity2 at his best , fighting hard and overtaking			0
' we are four races into the season and there are another 15 left , so i have no doubt after his driving in @entity12 , which was exceptional , we will have a very strong @entity2 bouncing back in @entity38 ( for the @entity39 @entity4 )			0
' @entity2 is already 27 points adrift of @entity1 team - mate @entity6 in the battle for this season 's title @entity2 dices with @entity10 asked as to what is required of @entity2 to overcome an in - form @entity6 , @entity0 replied : ' to qualify on pole and control the race from there			1
' we saw that @entity6 qualifying on pole , running away and being in control of the race was similar to what we had in @entity53			0
he was the key to scoring maximum points			0
' a concern for @entity0 , however , is the brake failures of @entity58 and @entity2 over the final two laps			0
for @entity2 , in particular , the brake system in his car failed on the penultimate lap , allowing a charging @entity10 an easy pass , although it is likely the @entity30 's pace at that stage would have resulted in him claiming second anyway			1
as for @entity6 , his brakes gave way on the final lap , but the 30 - year - old was able to cross the line 3.3 seconds ahead of @entity10			1
' we must be happy with one and three , no doubt about it , ' added @entity0			0
' but @entity2 losing second place because of a brake failure is a bit of a pity			0
' we saw very hot brakes on @entity2 's car in traffic following @entity18 ( @entity18 ) with lots of hard braking			1
we monitored that , but with the backmarkers and the lapping cars those brake temperatures went through the roof and we had a brake - by - wire failure on both cars in the same corner - @entity6 on the last lap , @entity2 on the penultimate lap. ' leading into the last lap it was under hard braking on the straight the temperatures went sky high			1
when that happens the brake - by - wire switches into a conventional system and then you are without weapons to defend			0

@entity2 fought his way past @entity10 and @entity18
he ultimately finished third after his brakes failed in closing stages
the @entity26 is now 27 points behind title leader @entity6
@entity6 has out - qualified and finished ahead of @entity2 at every race
