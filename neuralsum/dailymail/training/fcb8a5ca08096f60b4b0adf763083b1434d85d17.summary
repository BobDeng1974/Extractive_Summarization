@entity0 , the former archbishop of @entity1 , is firmly in favour of three - parent babies i fear i will be in trouble once again with some the @entity6 as i find myself , in conscience , having to go against the line churches are taking on so - called three - parent babies			1
i am , to be clear , firmly in favour despite opposition from some of my colleagues and a powerful lobby of critics from abroad			1
a @entity16 passed earlier this month will allow for a procedure in which a small proportion of a third person ’s dna is used to create an embryo in order to prevent potentially fatal genetic disorders			1
scientists have found techniques to replace faulty mitochondrial dna – mitochondria are energy - generating structures in human cells – with donated dna , and @entity30 is set to be the first country to endorse the practice			1
it has proved hugely contentious			1
yesterday 55 @entity35 mps asked our @entity36 to reject the @entity38 , claiming the consequences ‘ can not possibly be contained ’ within the @entity30			1
but this sort of opposition is unfathomable to me			1
this is an exciting medical intervention for families suffering rare conditions which prevent them from having children naturally			1
the idea of ‘ three - parent babies ’ is a distraction because the mitochondria are a mere fraction of what makes us human			1
this is much more like an organ transplant			1
only one in 5,000 @entity30 suffers from mitochondrial conditions but an estimated 2,500 women are carrying these faulty cells which could be passed on to their children			2
@entity59 is likely to be one of the first to receive this new treatment			1
she already has a daughter , @entity62 , who has @entity64 syndrome caused by her mother ’s faulty cells			2
@entity59 loves her daughter but knows she will never walk or talk and is likely to die as a result of organ failure			2
she says : ‘ when you are given the worst possible news it helps to have a little bit of hope			2
it would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child			2
’ let us be in no doubt , the new techniques , the result of amazing research at @entity81 , offer hope to those families who are at the mercy of such a terrible condition			1
they are now being given hope through the donation of healthy dna – a technique that could prevent their children suffering a gradual and painful death			2
@entity94 , the science writer and a supporter of the technique , has accused the churches of leaving families in great pain and suffering			1
he has written : ‘ surely … most church - going folk are not in the business of denying people hope merely to avoid the remote theoretical possibility of – well , of what exactly ? i still can not see a reasonable objection to this magnificent piece of technology in the service of human compassion			1
’ i have to agree			2
it is heartbreaking to see the churches once again opposing medical advances which have the potential to end great suffering			1
living in hope : @entity59 passed faulty dna to her daughter @entity62			2
the baby now has @entity64 syndrome compassion is at the heart of the @entity126 faith			2
the love of @entity128 and of our neighbour comes first and last			2
the link between faith and healing is very close			2
look only at the number of hospitals named after saints			0
i long for the @entity6 to end what some scientists feel is an overly negative opposition to extraordinary medical advances			1
one of the first steps is to address realistically the issue of pain at the end of life which has led so many of us to call for assisted dying			0
but it is time also for the churches to approach science and medicine more positively			1
the @entity6 risks being seen as irrelevant			0
conservative @entity154 have opposed transplants , @entity156 , embryo experimentation and stem cell research			0
furthermore , the @entity6 and science are always portrayed as being at odds even though this is often a misreading of history			0
thankfully , most @entity154 are not flat - earthers			0
we embrace modern science and the vast majority of its developments			0
the @entity6 has long been involved in the ethics committee of the @entity169 ( @entity169 )			0
we have resisted the notion that every single development is a ‘ slippery slope ’ to one peril or another			1
the primary motive must be compassion and the relief of suffering			0
so why have we become trapped in doubt and fear about medical advances involving the beginning of life ? i am constantly puzzled that @entity154 who believe in a gospel of hope find themselves in a perpetual state of opposition to scientific gains			1
the @entity187 , @entity188 , who played a key role in the consultation , is largely supportive the truth is that in spite of a few reservations about whether hereditary characteristics would be affected by the technique , there are absolutely no grounds for opposition			0
the @entity187 , @entity188 , who played a key role in the consultation , is largely supportive			0
he said recently : ‘ this has to begin with compassion			0
compassion towards those who are sick and suffering and for those who long to bear children			0
’ he wants there to be proper safeguards			0
but let us remember that this week in the @entity36 we are being asked to agree regulations to enable the @entity169 to consider each family ’s treatment on a case - by - case basis , taking expert advice into account			1
our country has an enviable tradition of responsible and thorough testing of research , and we can trust these experts to continue their painstaking work to enable families affected by serious mitochondrial disease to have healthy children			0
the main opposition is not from the @entity6 , and i find it surprising that bishops seem to be preparing to support a delaying motion from the @entity231 peer @entity230			0
it would be received by families as a cruel and unnecessary delay after seven years of investigation , consultation , parliamentary discussion and scrutiny			0
i respect the @entity231 position but it is an absolutist position with no room for compromise			0
like most peers i have received many emails and letters on the issue			0
much opposition is coming from well - organised campaigns from @entity231 from @entity248 and @entity249			0
but if we can not make any alteration , then we will deny ourselves the possibility of ever improving life for those who suffer from these intractable conditions			0
turning our backs on these advances is uncaring and unloving			0
we live in an exciting time for medical research and we must support caring scientists and doctors with the resources and proper regulations to do their work .			1

former archbishop of @entity267 is in favour of treatment
medical advancement uses third party @entity272 to avoid health problems
churches have warned against ' ethical issues ' surrounding technology
here @entity0 rejects their concerns about ' amazing ' development
