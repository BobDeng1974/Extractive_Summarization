@entity4 dr @entity3 offers some alternatives : poor olive harvests last year may mean a shortage of olive oil - so here are some alternatives best to roast veg : rapeseed rapeseed oil has 6 per cent saturated fat compared with olive oil 's 14.3 per cent			1
it also has ten times the amount of omega - 3 fatty acids and 50 per cent more vitamin @entity18 @entity19 : one of the healthiest oils , with a subtle , grassy taste			1
one concern with heating oil is how soon it starts to smoke			2
this is when the fatty acids in it oxidise , creating harmful free radicals			2
rapeseed oil has a high smoke point , so use for frying or roasting			2
best in risotto : rice bran taken from the bran ( the vitamin - rich layer below the fibrous hull of rice ) and germ ( the oily , nutrient - rich part of a rice grain )			0
high in protective antioxidants such as vitamin @entity18 @entity19 : as well as heart healthy vitamin e , this contains ferulic acid , which has powerful anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory effects , helping to protect the immune system and prevent disease			0
coconut oil makes great stir - fries best in stir - fries : coconut extracted from the white flesh of coconuts , this is almost 50 per cent lauric acid , a ' healthier ' saturated fatty acid			1
solid at room temperature , so ca n't be used for salad dressings , but its high smoke point makes it ideal for cooking			0
@entity19 : though it 's 86.5 per cent saturated fat , research suggests the saturated fat in coconut may be used up more quickly by the body and is less likely to be stored as body fat			1
however , use in moderation			0
best on salad : walnut with useful amounts of fatty acids , walnut oil may help lower heart disease risk			1
a distinct walnut flavour and low smoke point , so best for dressings			0
@entity19 : @entity80 , but not particularly versatile			0
buy small bottles and keep in a cool , dark place as it goes rancid easily			0
best for baking : hemp seed @entity86 in the essential fatty acids @entity87 , 6 and 9 than other culinary oils , and has half the saturated fat of olive oil			1
one tablespoon provides 94 per cent of your daily recommended intake of omega - 3s			2
@entity19 : versatile - can be used for stir - frying , dipping and salad dressing			2
one of the healthiest alternatives to olive oil , though the flavour may not be to everyone 's taste			1
disguise with dried fruit and spices			0
