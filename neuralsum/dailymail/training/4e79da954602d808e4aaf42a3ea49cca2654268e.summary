@entity2 , then aged 19 , is accused of planting two bombs near the marathon finish line in april 2013 with the help of his brother , @entity11			1
the attacks killed three people and injured more than 260			0
his lawyers had urged the 1st @entity1 @entity15 to move the high - profile trial out of @entity17 , claiming prospective jurors from the area had already made up their minds about his guilt			1
they had argued the intense media coverage of the case and the high number of people affected by the terror attacks made it impossible for @entity2 to find a fair and impartial jury in @entity4			2
the attacks killed three people and injured over 260			0
@entity39 , one of the bombs goes off but in a 2 - 1 ruling on friday , a three - judge panel found that the defense did not meet the standards necessary to have the trial - which features 12 jurors and six alternates - moved out of the region			1
chief judge @entity49 and judge @entity50 said any high - profile case would receive high media attention , but that knowledge of such case ' does not equate to disqualifying prejudice '			2
' distinguishing between the two is at the heart of the jury selection process , ' they wrote			0
the panel 's ruling followed prosecutors ' claims that judge @entity65 's questioning of prospective jurors had successfully weeded out people with strong opinions on @entity2 's guilt			1
it was not immediately evident whether @entity2 's defense team could ask the federal appeals court to review the request again before a full panel of six judges , in what is deemed an ' en banc ' review			1
on friday , judge @entity49 and judge @entity50 said it was not clear and indisputable that the publicity surrounding the former @entity83 student 's case required a change of venue			2
in court : @entity2 's ( pictured ) lawyers had urged the 1st @entity1 @entity15 to move the high - profile trial out of the state , claiming prospective jurors from the area had already made up their minds about his guilt defense : they had argued that the high number of people affected by the terror attacks made it impossible for @entity2 to find a fair and impartial jury in @entity4			1
above , defense attorneys ( @entity102 ) @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 arrive at the federal courthouse on the second day of jury selection on january 6 they added that the ongoing jury selection process did not suggest pervasive prejudice , nor did the defense team demonstrate irreparable harm if the trial was not moved out of @entity4			2
the judges noted that other high - profile terrorism cases such as the 1993 @entity116 bombing and the prosecution of @entity118 - the man who became known as the ' 20th hijacker ' from the september 11 attacks - occurred in the district where the crimes occurred			2
but in a dissent , judge @entity123 voiced his support for moving the trial , writing : ' if a change of venue is not required in a case like this , i can not imagine a case where it would be			0
he added : ' if residents of the @entity137 of the @entity138 did not already resent @entity2 and predetermine his guilt , the constant reporting on the @entity3 bombing and its aftermath could only further convince the prospective jurors of his guilt			2
' federal appeals court : but in a 2 - 1 ruling on friday , a three - judge panel at the 1st @entity1 @entity15 ( pictured ) found that the defense did not meet the standards necessary to have the trial moved out of @entity17 a spokesman for the @entity1 attorney 's office declined to comment on the ruling on friday			1
a defense attorney did not immediately respond to an email from the @entity154 seeking comment			0
lawyers for @entity2 , now aged 21 , had asked @entity157 three times to move the trial			0
each time , he had refused , saying bias among prospective jurors could be rooted out through carefult questioning about their thoughts on @entity2 and the death penalty			0
the same jury that will decide on @entity2 's guilt will also decide whether he lives or dies			0
if he is convicted , the only possible punishments are life in prison without parole or the death penalty			0
only jurors who said they will give meaningful consideration to both can be seated on the jury			0

he died in a shootout with police after the bombing earlier this year , federal public defender @entity182 told the appeals court that the local jury pool is ' connected to the case in many ways ' and can not be counted on to be fair and impartial			0
' this attack was viewed as an attack on the marathon itself - and an attack on @entity17 , ' mr @entity190 told the court , adding the trial needed to be moved to maintain public confidence in the judicial system however , assistant u.s. attorney @entity196 declared that prospective jurors who have strong opinions had ' unhesitatingly admitted ' them , allowing the judge to rule them out as jurors			1
