by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 07:17 est , 11 april 2013 in @entity2 's national museum , home to some of the world 's most precious artefacts of ancient @entity7 , a caption beside a skeleton simply reads in @entity10 : ' dated to very old time			1
' and some of the museum 's most impressive pieces carry no labels at all - like a giant stone head lying on the ground that may or may not belong on a nearby empty pedestal labelled ' @entity18 , ' the @entity20 tormentor of the patriarch @entity21			1
ten years after @entity2 's national museum was looted and smashed by thieves during the @entity26 - led invasion in 2003 to topple @entity27 , it is still far from ready to reopen to the public			1
a sign next to a skeleton in @entity2 's national museum says it is ' dated to very old time '			1
the staff face the problem of not having enough background about the museum 's collection and an incomplete inventory ten years after the @entity26 invasion , the national museum is still not ready to reopen to the public only @entity2 students and officials or foreign delegations are able to visit the museum by prior arrangement among the treasures that survived the looting is this lion , symbolising @entity49 , the goddess of love and war			1
the panel came from the @entity53 , @entity54 and dates back to the reign of @entity56 from 605 - 562bc work to overcome decades of neglect and the destruction of war has been hindered by power struggles , poorly - skilled staff and the persistent violence plaguing the country , said @entity63 , @entity2 's most senior antiquities official			1
' i wish that the great historical @entity66 would appear in her finest face and that the @entity2 museum opens , ' said @entity63 , the head of antiquities in the @entity72			1
' but our wishes crash against the unfortunate reality we live in			0
' the museum was once the showcase for 7,000 years of history in @entity7 , birthplace of some of the first cities and one of the first writing systems - cuneiform - and home to a succession of major civilisations , including the @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , through to a flourishing @entity91 empire			1
the museum was left a wreck the day after @entity66 fell to @entity26 troops on april 10 , 2003			1
@entity96 clay scrolls and pottery littered the floor			0
looters made off with everything from gold bowls and ritual funeral masks to elaborate headdresses			0
the @entity26 was sharply criticised for not protecting the museum			1
recovered statues from the 2003 looting because the museum 's inventory was never completed , it is uncertain how many pieces were stolen , but the number is estimated at 15,000 pieces			1
more than a quarter have been retrieved , said @entity63 , who has overseen the museum formally since 2012 but has been involved in its renovations for the past five years			1
@entity116 began soon after the museum was smashed up in 2003 , starting with the basics , such as computers , office furniture , air conditioning			1
by mid- 2004 , the museum was rewired for electricity and most basic repairs to its structure completed			1
since then , the @entity26 and @entity127 governments have helped renovate the halls			1
but work has been slow			0
only five of 30 exhibition halls have been renovated so far - and two of those have to be done again because they were improperly done			2
as a result , the museum is still not open to the general public			2
its only visitors are specially arranged foreign delegations , @entity2 officials and field trips by @entity2 students			0
it is part of a broader problem of preservation of antiquities in @entity2			0
there are over 12,000 registered archaeological sites in @entity2 but they are mostly not protected , allowing for widespread , ongoing looting , @entity63 told the @entity148			0
the museum itself was shut from the early 1990s by regime officials who said they feared for its safety , as @entity27 mired the country in war , leading to crippling sanctions			1
the closure meant the museum 's inventory was n't updated			1
sanctions meant staff could n't update their skills , and many qualified employees left amid an exodus of @entity2 from the country			2
tens of thousands of artefacts chronicling some 7,000 years of civilisation in @entity7 are believed to have been looted from @entity2 in the chaos which followed the @entity26 - led invasion ten years ago despite international efforts , fewer than half of the missing artefacts have so far been found and returned to the museum objects in the museum include this cosmetic container carved from stone , found near @entity178 statues from the ninth century @entity180 are among the works still in the museum 's possession in a central @entity66 quarter , the museum is surrounded by high concrete blast walls			1
guards check bags in a caravan set up in the neglected museum garden			2
the main entrance is under construction , so visitors enter through a corridor leading to administrative rooms			0
an @entity148 reporter said the renovated exhibition halls were eerily quiet , with gleaming floors and shining display cases , the artefacts encased neatly inside			0
the sound of workers employing drills was palpable as they renovated another hall			0
a ladder was strewn under a map of ancient @entity7			0
fewer than half of the 15,000 stolen objects have been found and returned two of the renovated rooms are meant to showcase the @entity87 civilization , which emerged some 3,000 years ago			1
but the labels on the artefacts shed little light on the antiquities that represent some of humankind 's most important milestones			2
many labels lacked the age of the artefact , where it was found , what civilisation it belonged to , or what its use was			0
some did n't have labels at all			0
nowhere in the hall - or anywhere else - is it explained who the @entity87 were or how they influenced later civilisations			2
in one of the displays lay a skeleton in the earth it was found in , alongside rings and jars			0
a printed label beside it read : ' a human skeleton found in situ , put beside him some jars and rings between him dated to very old time			0
' the label on a fist - sized figurine of a monkey clutching his ears simply identifies it as ' some monkey			2
' a hand - sized stone carving in one display case was described as ' the legendary hero @entity252 wrestling with two lions , early 3rd millennium , ' with no further explanation of who @entity252 was - the @entity87 hero - king of one of the first written stories in history			1
@entity262 - based @entity2 archaeologist @entity261 , who is following the renovations , said labels were lacking because the outdated inventory did n't list the pieces and the staff , lacking expertise , were n't familiar with the pieces ' background			1
a @entity272 official advising on the renovation said it was better to display the pieces imperfectly than keep them hidden			2
but more problematic and confusing , is that the displays in the @entity87 halls mix in artefacts from the later @entity88 era , as well as from the @entity280 , an entirely different hominid species from homo sapiens that died out some 30,000 years ago			0
@entity63 said the two halls would be renovated again this year			0
sometime this year , he hopes , all the finished halls can be opened to the general public			0
other renovated halls fared better			0
displays in the hall on @entity66 's @entity91 dynasty were clear			2
another hall explained the significance of the 5,000 year - old @entity293 city of @entity294 , adorned with rare statues			2
the items still under the museum 's care include this @entity300 carved stone vessel found in the @entity178 area other treasures include a limestone slab depicting the water god , @entity305 , receiving a minor deity stone figures depicting the family of @entity309 , the king of @entity294 , found at the site of the ancient city another find from @entity294 , this limestone statue of a cloaked woman the museum 's prize is the soaring @entity89 hall , chronicling the kingdom that rose to become a major empire in the region in the 2nd and 1st millennia @entity321 the hall is lined with stone etchings of giant winged creatures and statues of hand - clasped @entity89 kings			1
yet even here , at the hall 's rear , lay the unidentified broken stone head the size of an exercise ball , bearded and wearing a crown			2
@entity334 stood an empty pedestal labeled for a statue of @entity18			0
' even the renovations that have been done are disappointing			0
i wo n't compare it to the great museums of the world , but still - it 's way behind , ' said a @entity343 adviser to the museum who spoke anonymously , not wishing to offend local staff			1
turf battles over the museum have n't helped			2
the culture ministry and tourism ministry both claimed authority over the museum in 2005 , confusing staff and delaying renovations			2
the body that directly oversees the museum - the @entity356 - was leaderless from 2006 onwards			1
in 2012 , the @entity2 parliament finally definitively put the museum under the tourism ministry			0
ongoing violence , particularly suicide bombings hitting @entity66 during most of the past ten years , has also kept away foreign experts who could have helped speed the process , said @entity365			0
the violence also means tourists are staying away from @entity2 , reducing the incentive for staff to speed up renovations			0
one @entity26 official said it was better for the museum to display the items with imperfect details rather than hide them away if the museum had stayed closed , more than 7,000 years of @entity7 history would be hidden from the world although @entity2 is relatively safer since the height of violence in 2007 , there are still frequent attacks against government institutions , mostly the hallmark of @entity385			1
ultimately , the museum did n't have to be world - class , said @entity365			1
' the antiquities are so unique and rich , sometimes you forget if they are exhibited well or not , ' she said			0
the museum 's woes mattered little to a visiting group of @entity2 schoolgirls			1
they rushed into the room , gaping at the statues , taking notes			0
' it 's not like television , ' said @entity401 , 19			0
' now if somebody says something about our history , i can say i saw it in reality			0

the museum was looted of 15,000 pieces during the @entity26 - led war
fewer than half of the items have been recovered , despite international hunt
the museum 's inventory was incomplete - making labelling objects *difficult*
it had closed in the early 1990s for safety amid @entity27 's rule
