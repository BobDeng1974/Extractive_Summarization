' the sheer number of bank accounts operated by the family and their ability to transfer significant funds between them fly in the face of their claims of illiteracy and ignorance of matters such as income tax			0
' no matter how you earn money , paying tax matters			0
but denying the honest @entity333 public of their contribution to tax was not enough for the @entity312 who went further by setting out to take funds set aside for those who most need them			0
