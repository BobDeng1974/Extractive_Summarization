a woman who wet herself on a scary ride was horrified to discover a photo of her unfortunate accident is being used to promote the @entity4			1
the woman lost control of her bladder on a ‘ terrifying ’ horror maze , ‘ @entity12 ’ which is strictly restricted to people 16 years and over at @entity10 in @entity11 a photo of a woman leaving the attraction with an embarrassing wet patch has been used on the amusement park ’s @entity18 page , accompanied with the slogan ‘ p * * * your pants scary ! ’ the post has attracted more than 1000 likes and the woman involved says she has been completely humiliated , even though her face is not shown in the photo			1
even though the woman 's face is not included in the image , she claims to have been humiliated when friends and family identified her by her clothing the woman wet herself in ' @entity12 ' , a newly updated horror maze in @entity41 , which is so terrifying that it is restricted to people 16 years and over the woman , who did not wish to reveal her identity , complained to the media about her embarrassing moment being showcased so publically , explaining that family and friends have mocked her after recognising her by her clothing			1
she demanded that the photo be taken by @entity10 , according to the @entity50			1
the newly updated maze is only open after dark and uses actors who chase the ‘ victims ’ with chainsaws – making it seem slightly understandable how the woman could have lost control of her bladder			0
in fact , @entity10 management claims on average five people wet themselves every evening			1
however , a friend who was there on the night insists that the woman involved wet herself as she could n’t stop laughing , not out of terror			2
the woman contacted @entity11 media about the incident			1
this left the @entity10 staff perplexed , wondering why the woman still had n't at any point made her concerns known to the company the ' @entity10 ' is only opened at night and uses ' terror actors ' who they describe as ' dressed up , made up , and desperate to scare you an aerial view of the terrifying maze at @entity80 yet when reached for comment , the @entity10 explained that they were puzzled why they had not been approached by the woman making the complaints			1
furthermore , at the time of the interview they had been unable to locate her			0
@entity10 managing director @entity87 was perplexed as to why the woman involved spoke to the media and never contacted the amusement park directly			1
' we 've heard nothing from the woman , nothing from her friends , nothing from her family			0
' we 've had that photo up on our page for about a week and half now			0
’ ms @entity87 insists that , if contacted , they would have happily taken the photo down			0
' ( if she had contacted us ) we 'd take it down straight away , that 's not a problem at all			0
‘ if she had been so upset about it , then why have n't they contacted us ? ’ spookers explain that in the maze , the actors ' come out crawling , moaning , groaning , screaming or exploding with chainsaws running ' she also pointed out that visitors have ample warning that photos will be taken and the company reserve the right to publish the images as they wish			2
" we do have a sign saying we take photos for promotional reasons but if people call us we remove the photos from @entity18 immediately			2
" she explained to @entity122 that @entity123 had not been able to locate the woman			1
' you ca n't tell who it is and we do n't even know because she has n't contacted us			0
‘ the photo does n’t appear in full ( revealing the woman ’s identity ) anywhere on the @entity132			2
’ the managing director insists that people wet themselves so frequently at the ‘ scream park ’ that they have often used the slogan ‘ p * * * your pants scary ’ in promotional campaigns and on bumper stickers			1
the woman insists that she wet her pants from laughing too much - not out of terror she also recalled that most people are amused when they wet themselves , with a tendance to ‘ walk out and make a scene about it ’			1
there were mixed reactions from the public online , as @entity153 users took to @entity18 to share their opinion			2
some people were outraged that @entity123 had chosen to make the image public			0
‘ i think its very bad taste and i wouldnt come to spookers in the future			0
you obviously get a kick out of peoples embarrasment and humiliation ( sic ) , ’ wrote one person			0
‘ @entity123 - we are your future customers , think twice how you treat your customers			2
’ the amusement park insist they would have taken the image down if the woman had contacted them directly however the majority of people took a lighter view of the situation , with many people taking the opportunity to play around with puns			0
‘ its all just a bit of fun , nothing wrong with taking the p * * * every once in a while , ’ someone wrote			2
the debacle came to a conclusion when the woman finally made contact with @entity192 , resulting in an apology and the decision that the infamous image could stay			0
‘ @entity10 has just been contacted by the lovely person in the cover photograph , ’ the company confirmed on @entity18			1
‘ we have talked through the way the photo has been handled , and together we have come to an arrangement that includes an agreement that the photo can continued to be used			0
‘ we really appreciate her generous gesture to @entity10 in allowing this , and have apologised for the embarrassment that she has felt			0
’ the ' @entity10 ' is open in two locations in @entity11 and is now looking for a site in @entity210			1
