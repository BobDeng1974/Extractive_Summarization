the legality of parking tickets issued by enforcement firms is being challenged in a landmark case at the @entity4			1
in a stand against what he calls ' bullying ' tactics , @entity9 , who owns a fish and chip shop in @entity11 , @entity12 , will say today that an £ 85 fine for exceeding his two - hour free stay by 56 minutes was disproportionate and should not be enforced			2
if he wins , what critics see as a nauseating bonanza will end and new systems will be put in place to manage parking on private land			1
his action comes after the @entity25 exposed the antics of ' parking cowboys ' last year			1
@entity28 in @entity29 is one of many @entity28 identified by the @entity25 last summer as installing signs and cameras in car parks warning customers they can stay a maximum of 90mins or face a £ 100 fine in a hard - hitting campaign , we revealed how the rogue firms are making tens of millions of pounds from fines handed out to motorists who overstay – sometimes for only a few minutes - in car parks at hospitals , railway stations , shopping centres and fast food outlets like @entity47 's			1
cancer sufferers and patients whose treatment has over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking squads who issue official - looking £ 100 tickets			1
mr @entity9 , who owns the @entity55 fish and chips takeaway in @entity11 , @entity12 , says he 's making his stand against a firm called @entity59 on behalf of every motorist in the country			2
he has dedicated hundreds of hours and made three court appearances in an attempt to change the law that allows ' bullying ' parking operators to ' extort ' money from people			1
he said : ' i 'm not an activist , i 'm not an armchair lawyer			2
i was just someone who got a ticket			0
' but as i researched my case i became incredibly angry with the way parking companies operate and bully people because they exploit human weakness – doing what we 're told			1
' there 's lots of strongly worded language saying you must pay , with @entity87 photos			0
it 's all deliberately made to look like parking tickets but they are just speculative invoices			1
' i thought what it would be like if it happened to my mother - in - law – she would have been afraid and frightened and would have paid immediately			0
' mr @entity9 received a demand for £ 85 – discountable to £ 50 if paid within 14 days - after parking at @entity96 in @entity97 on april 15 , 2013			1
the site offers two free hours of parking and he returned 56 minutes late			1
he ignored the first three demands from @entity59 after researching his rights on the internet but had no option but to fight his case when he received a court summons			0
a close - up of the sign : we revealed how the rogue firms are making tens of millions of pounds from fines handed out to motorists who overstay mr @entity9 's case centres on the argument that the ticket was unfair because it was a disproportionate sum for an hour 's parking			1
a judge found against him at @entity117 last year , where he was not legally represented			1
the ruling stated operators like @entity59 are entitled to impose charges higher than their outgoings – and more expensive than typical parking charges in the area – to act as a deterrent			2
now a barrister , @entity125 , has offered to represent mr @entity9 pro bono at the @entity128 hearing in @entity129 next week			0
the 47 - year - old added : ' i 'm hoping that parking companies will no longer be allowed to act in the current way			1
' i agree there is a need for parking management			2
in the place where i overstayed it 's close to the train station and if there was no management system it would be clogged up with commuters			0
so something is needed but this is not it			0
' his wife , @entity144 , added the free parking system at @entity96 was unfair because drivers sometimes spent up to half an hour waiting for a space after driving in			2
she added : ' @entity9 has put in a hell of a lot of time but he should still pursue it			0
it 's not just about him – it 's about other people that panic when they get one of those letters			0
' i 'm proud of him for standing up to those bullies			0
' mr @entity9 's case has been strengthened by new research by the @entity161 which suggests hundreds of thousands of drivers are likely to have been illegally penalised for overstaying their welcome whilst parking on private land - and could be entitled to repayments totalling many tens of millions of pounds			1
it says that parking companies are levying huge charges on drivers ' out of all proportion ' to the losses suffered by landowners as a result of motorists ' actions			2
although the @entity181 banned clamping on private land , drivers who stay longer than the time they have paid for are still likely to receive tickets that demand payments of up to £ 100 , and in some cases significantly more			1
in his paper for the @entity161 barrister @entity186 argues that this is likely to be several times more than compensation for a genuine loss			0
mr @entity191 , who will not be a witness at mr @entity9 's case , says : ' payments at the level that operators presently demand as sanctions are unlikely to count as genuine pre-estimate of loss ; they should be seen by the @entity201 as penalties , which means they are unenforceable			0
' if the courts agree with mr @entity191 that many of the tickets issued are ' extravagant and unconscionable ' , drivers are potentially in line to receive tens , if not hundreds , of millions of pounds in refunds			0
professor @entity210 , director of the @entity161 , said : ' we would like to see this legal argument tested in a higher court so that a binding precedent is set			0
at the same time we would like the government to do what it should have done at the outset and set out what are reasonable charges			0
' a @entity59 spokesperson said : ' @entity59 can not comment on the outcome of a yet unheard case but remains confident in its position			0

if he wins , what critics see as a nauseating cash bonanza will end
new systems must then be introduced to manage parking on private land
