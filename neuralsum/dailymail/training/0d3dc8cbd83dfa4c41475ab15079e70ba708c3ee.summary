a d - day veteran left for dead on a @entity2 battlefield has unearthed a haunting letter that prematurely informed his family of his death			1
private @entity7 's superiors thought he 'd been killed when they found him lying unconscious and covered in blood after a mortar bomb exploded and he was peppered with shrapnel			1
his unit was making its way back to @entity13 , following several hours of fighting , having earlier landed on the beach in @entity2 as part of june 6 , 1944 's allied invasion of northern @entity18			2
back from the dead : private @entity7 's superiors sent his family a letter telling them he 'd been killed in d - day landings in @entity18 in june 1944 after finding him unconscious			1
mr @entity7 is pictured holding the letter ( left ) , and as a 19 - year - old soldier ( right ) with the blood - soaked 19 - year - old motionless , his commander sergeant @entity25 assumed the worst before running for cover			1
but fortune shone on the recent conscript , who was scooped up by the medical corps and awoke the following day in a @entity33 hospital			2
deafened in one ear , he immediately wrote to his parents to give them the good news of his survival			2
but sergeant @entity25 , believing his comrade had been killed , had also written to his family to share his sorrow at the news			1
it was only when his mother died , in 1988 , that mr @entity7 found the letter - and which the 87 - year - old is now considering donating to his local museum in @entity47 , @entity48			1
bizarrely , private @entity7 fought alongside sergeant @entity25 again later on in the war , when @entity7 rejoined @entity51 of the @entity52			1
historic : private @entity7 was injured as allied troops landed on the beaches in @entity2 in june 1944			1
@entity56 is pictured secured after d - day an astonished @entity58 described the unexpected reunion as like ' seeing a ghost '			1
but the pair never spoke about the note home that detailed how @entity7 had been buried in a tiny @entity18 village			1
although his mother never mentioned the letter , mr @entity7 said he felt sure his own had arrived first			1
' when i found that letter it shook me , ' he said			2
' i had never seen it			0
it was brilliant that i got my letter in before he did			2
' had it been the other way round , i do n't know what would have happened			0
' triumphant : after landing at the shore , these @entity75 troops wait for the signal to move forward , during the initial @entity79 landing operations in @entity2 , @entity18 , on june 6 , 1944 private @entity7 survived the war despite suffering a second injury in october 1944 and experiencing a fierce battle at @entity84 , near @entity85 , where his comrade corporal @entity86 died winning the @entity88			1
in peacetime , @entity89 - born mr @entity7 married his wife @entity91 , had two daughters , and worked as a driver and conductor for @entity96 buses before retiring to @entity97 in @entity48			1
mr @entity7 said of his unusual piece of war memorabilia : ' i 've got no grandchildren , my daughters are n't interested in it , so i 'm not sure what to do with it			2
' i 've been debating for years whether to take it down to @entity107			0
' dear madam please let me on behalf of all ranks of my regiment convey our deepest sympathy in the loss of your dearly beloved son @entity114			0
i was his section commander so i realise that it 's my place to let you know all i can about your son			0
i found him a very happy person , very keen on his job			0
he was greatly liked by us all and [ be ] assured that he is missed terribly by everyone			0
he died at peace with the world and without any suffering , which i can thank @entity129 for			0
he was buried in a little @entity18 village by the military authorities with other mates of his			0
his grave is being attended to daily by a party of gallant little @entity18 people constantly under enemy fire			0
they are therefore showing their gratitude to us all by their action			0
we have all done our best for him and i sincerely hope you will be able to understand that i have written to make things more clear to you			0
if there is anything further we can do for you i would like you to say			0
in expressing our heartfelt feelings again from all concerned , i am yours sincerely @entity151			0
