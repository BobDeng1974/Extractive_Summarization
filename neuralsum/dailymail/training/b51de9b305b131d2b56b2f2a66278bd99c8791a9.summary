by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 03:10 est , 17 january 2014 a condemned @entity3 killer gasped , snorted and snored during a prolonged execution using a controversial , never - before - tried lethal injection this morning			1
death row inmate @entity7 took 15 minutes to die by the two - drug combination , a method adopted after supplies of the state 's previous drug dried up , and declared that he was going to @entity12 before succumbing to the cocktail			1
' i 'm going to heaven , i 'll see you there when you come , ' he said in the small , windowless room in the @entity19 correctional facility			2
he was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m. , after one of the longest executions since @entity3 resumed capital punishment in 1999			1
the 53 - year - old 's attorneys had argued against using intravenous doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone , claiming the combination would cause ' air hunger ' - where someone experiences immense terror and agony as they strain for breath during the execution			1
@entity35 's snorts and gasps , and prolonged death , suggest he may have indeed suffered the medical phenomenon and could prompt @entity3 officials to review using the drug cocktail			1
previous executions with the former execution drugs took much less time , and typically did not include the loud sounds that @entity35 uttered			2
his family are now suing , saying he was ' tortured ' during the execution @entity35 thanked his 22 - year - old victim 's family for a letter he received from them , referring to ' kind words ' that meant a lot			1
@entity60 's sister @entity59 wrote in the note that she had forgiven him but also insisted ' it is time - past time - for him to pay for what he did to my sister			2
' he opened and shut his hands as if waving to his adult son , daughter and daughter - in - law sitting a few feet away and a full minute later he stood up and told them , ' i love you , i love you			1
' he was then still for five minutes before emitting a loud snort as if snoring and continued to make this noise for several minutes			0
his stomach rose and fell several times as he repeatedly opened and shut his mouth , making what the @entity79 described as ' deep , rattling sounds			1
' his family sobbed as they watched him slowly die			2
at one point , his daughter exclaimed ' @entity85 ' as she observed her father 's final moments			1
a coughing sound was @entity7 's last apparent movement , at 10:43 a.m. he was pronounced dead 10 minutes later			1
@entity35 as first injected with the drugs at 10:29 a.m. @entity35 's last meal yesterday consisted of roast beef , a cream cheese bagel , fried chicken , potatoes two ways , butter pecan ice cream and @entity98			1
he skipped a shower and breakfast this morning and had a final visit with his children before the scheduled execution			2
on wednesday , he arrived calmly at the death house and spent the night writing letters , phoning his mother and sister and visiting with his son and daughter			2
@entity35 's attorneys had warned the convicted rapist and murderer would likely suffer from air hunger , which sees a person experience immense pain and terror as they strain to catch their breath before they die			1
they argued sentencing him to this manner of death was unconstitutionally cruel			0
experimental : @entity35 was executed at this facility by @entity3 's untested execution method punishment : the death chamber at the @entity128 in @entity19			1
@entity3 used intravenous doses of two drugs , midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller , to put @entity35 to death @entity3 has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the @entity140 manufacturer of the previous drug , pentobarbital , stopped allowing its use in lethal injections			1

@entity167 is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class			0
it is a derivative of morphine			0
an expert in @entity7 's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what 's known as ' air hunger ' or simply an acute shortness of breath			1
the clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one 's breathing effort			1
it is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations			0
reports from @entity35 's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred			2
as such , the appropriateness of the drugs , and the extent to which they may be cruel , will likely be reviewed by @entity3 officials before they are used in another execution			0

at the request of @entity35 's lawyers , judge @entity218 on wednesday also ordered the state to photograph and then preserve the drugs ' packaging boxes and vials and the syringes used in the execution			1
@entity224 , executive director of the anti-capital punishment @entity226 , told @entity227 after the execution that @entity35 's gasps may lead the state or the courts to rethink the new drug combination			1
' this does nâ€™t sound like it was a complete disaster but they do n't want anything that even has the appearance of someone suffering or a delay in death being carried out , ' @entity224 said			0
' this is going to be looked at with good concern			0
' it is not unheard of for an execution to take 15 minutes or even longer , but @entity224 told the network that if the prisoner was physically struggling much of that time , it could be seen as cruel			0
' this sounds like more discomfort than they would want in carrying out an execution , ' he said			0
