by @entity0 at first glance a high glamour glossy fashion shoot , these pictures soon reveal themselves to be so much more			0
the opulent jewellery dripping off the model ’s ears are in fact diamond encrusted hearing aids , and several of the shots also show the model leaning on elaborately decorated walking aids			1

they are both enriching our experiences in the world '			0
@entity16 , who hand crafted all the hearing aids and walkers for the project , was inspired by her own grandmother , who resisted using such aids because of the connotations associated with them			1
‘ i do n’t remember a time when her hair and nails were n’t done and she was n’t dressed impeccably			0
in the last year of her life she , like many others in her condition , lost the ability to walk without support			0
' and although she had a strong will to live , the idea of using a walker in public seemed unbearable to her			0
the force of her vanity had come up against the limit of the body			0
i loved my grandmother deeply and i miss her in this world and i hope these pictures would make her smile			0

speaking to @entity112 says : ‘ i chose to do this project because the moment @entity16 mentioned it to me i could just imagine this world where all these people were walking around with blinged out walkers , just rocking it down the street			1
‘ and having hearing aids be just as beautiful as earrings ; it felt like a celebration of life and what we can do , instead of a chore and embarrassment and a reminder of what we lack			1
‘ i love creating photographs that have a deeper message than just being a pretty picture , which was why this project really spoke to me			0
