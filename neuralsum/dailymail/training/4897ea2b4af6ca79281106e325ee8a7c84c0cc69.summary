by @entity0 former @entity2 captain @entity1 is to build a new ' iceberg ' home in @entity5 after he was granted permission to demolish the £ 3million mansion in its place			1
@entity1 's three - storey property in the leafy north @entity11 district will be torn down and replaced with a four - storey , five - bedroom palace over more than 9,000sq/ft , plans show			1
@entity15 has given them go - ahead after months of wrangling to accommodate neighbours who feared not only months of disruption but also that the new house would overlook their homes and gardens			1
the new home , built in dark brick , will be a ' very private space ' which is ' set into the gradient of the hillside ' and boasts ' views across the treetops '			2
the basement level will include parking for two cars - reached by a car lift and assisted by a mechanised turntable - as well as a cinema room and extensive storage space			2
the ground floor will have a gym , games room and bar , swimming pool , solarium and two guest suites ; the first floor will have a large open plan kitchen and dining area , as well as a raised lawn area ; and the third floor will have the master bedroom and two further bedrooms , all en - suite , and another balcony			0
according to reports , @entity1 decided to demolish the existing building , which was built in the late 1980s and already includes an indoor pool , after he discovered it was riddled with damp			1
the proposed development as seen from another angle			0
@entity68 objected to the plans saying that the new house could overlook their homes , cause light pollution and that building work could damage nearby properties but a flurry of objections , which raised fears that the new property would ruin the character of the conservation area and overlook nearby homes , made planning officials think twice about granting permission			1
one neighbour objected to a 20m - long window planned for the main stairwell of the home that he feared would ' spoil the quite ( sic ) and dark rural character of the area at night '			1
' i accept that this will not result in overlooking but i am very concerned about the light spill to me and my neighbours , ' he wrote			0
' the glazing would light the main stairwell which feeds all rooms and is therefore likely to be lit at all times			0
' another raised fears the plans for the excavations , which would delve nearly 5m below the foundation level of the property 's north - west corner , could cause damage to nearby buildings			2
a third accused @entity1 and his wife of failing to consult with any of the nearby neighbours in what the objection called ' this very sensitive environmental and conservation area '			0
' this lack of prior neighbour consultation is extremely rare in this @entity117 , ' the objection said			0
' we can only surmise that the applicant ... never intends to live in the new house proposed and so could not care about neighbourhood sentiments			0
' @entity1 and his wife @entity122 : the couple also have a £ 2.2million home in @entity125 , @entity126 the house as it currently looks			1
it dates back to the late - 1980s and is being torn down now after @entity1 discovered that it was riddled with damp			1
@entity68 suspect he wants to then sell on the new development following months of negotiations , the couple have made concessions , including axing plans for a roof terrace and , according to reports , agreeing to pay £ 48,000 towards community infrastructure			2
the @entity139 quoted a planning official as saying : ' the applicant has supplied a satisfactory construction management plan to show that the proposal would not harm the local transport network , and the basement impact has been independently assessed and considered to comply with the relevant policies			0
' @entity1 , 38 , was born in @entity147 but moved to @entity148 with his family when he was eight			2
in a glittering football career he won three @entity152 titles with @entity2 , and four @entity154 titles with @entity155 and @entity156			0
he has 107 caps for @entity148 , playing in their @entity159 and @entity160 - winning sides			1
he finished his career at @entity162 , where he is now manager of the club 's @entity163			0
he also has a £ 2.2million home in @entity166 , @entity126 .			1
