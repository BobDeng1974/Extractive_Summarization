by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 10:01 est , 8 november 2013 dentist @entity1 has fitted plenty of dentures in his time - but never to a goose			1
@entity6 - who was given a girl 's name by his owners who originally thought he was female - lost half his beak when he was just six months old after accidentally chomping on barbed wire			1
the seven - year - old goose had been using his tongue to replace the missing part of the beak following the accident			1
but after @entity18 's beak began to deteriorate , mr @entity1 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , stepped in and used his dental skills to patch it up crafting a prosthetic beak out of materials normally used for false teeth			1
she was initially told her beloved goose would probably have to be put down so she sought a second opinion with local vet @entity29 , from @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45			1
mr @entity29 created a temporary fix for @entity18 using dental resin and orthopaedic screws which allowed him to start eating and drinking normally			0
before and after : the painful looking injury ( right ) caused by barbed wire left @entity18 unable to eat properly			1
thanks to the new prosthetic , she 's back on flying form he then called his dentist friend @entity1 of the @entity56 , in nearby @entity57			1
he put @entity18 under general anesthetic and took some silicone impressions of his beak using dental materials			1
a technician was able to cast the impressions to produce a study model which was used as a template to make the new beak			2
mr @entity1 used a material called cold cured dental acrylic , which is the same substance used for creating human dentures			0
the dental practitioner said it was the first time he had treated a goose in his 20 years in the job			1
he said : ' the vet is a very good friend of mine , and when i got the phone call i thought it was a joke to start with			0
have a gander : staff at the @entity82 's veterinary practice have grown quite fond of their new feathered friend ' i 've helped before dealing with root fillings for dogs , but this is the first time ever i have operated on a goose			1
' this sort of operation is fairly rare and it 's quite rare for the animal to survive			0
' fitting the beak took around an hour			2
@entity93 , practice manager at the vets , told how the procedure should have cost £ 100 but was done for free as the surgery had never seen anything like @entity18 ’s condition before			2
she said : ' @entity18 came in with his beak hanging apart			2
he was managing to eat and maintain his weight by using his tongue , but it was dried out due to overusing it			0
' it took just 45 minutes to fix on @entity18 ’s new beak and we ’re looking to send him home for the future soon			2
this is a very rare operation and something which i do n’t think we ’ll ever see in this vets again			0
' everyone has done a fantastic job and thankfully @entity18 is doing really well now			0
' send me the bill : the newly patched up @entity18 happily strolls around the farm in @entity20 mrs @entity33 said : ' when he was six months old , i took him to a farm but he suffered an accident whilst he was there			2
' i took him to the vets near to where i live , but they said they could n't do anything about it			0
' he had bitten on some barbed wire , and as time had gone by more of his beak had been pulled away and he used his tongue to compensate that			1
' his tongue became quite sore and hard so three weeks ago i took him to @entity82 's , who said they may be able to help			0
' thanks : @entity29 from the veterinary surgery admires his work she added : ' @entity18 is really special and incredibly tame , i just thought i had to to what i could			0
' it 's amazing how he 's managed to survive seven years with this , but after i spotted his tongue dropping , i knew something drastic had to be done			0
' without the vets at @entity82 's , @entity18 would n't be alive now and i 'm so grateful for what they have done			0
' i do n't have any children and he is my life , we have a special bond and i 'm so glad he 's been saved			0
