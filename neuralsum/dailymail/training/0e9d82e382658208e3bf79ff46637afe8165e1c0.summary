when she was finally given a smear test she was told by the nurse that she was bleeding internally			0
three days later specialists revealed they had found abnormal cells			0
mrs @entity5 , said : ' when i went to have my biopsy done they told me that they were 99.9 per cent sure it was cancer and they were right			1

we need some positive news after what has been the worst year imaginable			0
' i hope other women , pregnant or not , read my story and look - out for the symptoms of cervical cancer			1

the cervical cancer has destroyed any hope of the couple having more children mr @entity151 , founder and ceo of @entity167 's @entity150 said : ' receiving a cancer diagnosis either during pregnancy or shortly after a birth is a situation that affects women across the @entity173 every year but yet which there is very little awareness of or recognition			1
' the trauma and challenges this places on a family are devastating , during a time when they should be excited about the prospect of a new birth or celebrating a new arrival			2
' after @entity5 got in touch with @entity167 's @entity150 and explained her situation in june this year we were able to help her in terms of emotional support by being able to speak to other women regularly who shared many of the experiences she was having and yet faced through our confidential forum			2
' he added : ' in additional i am glad to say that we were able to help her with some of the additional nursery fees that her family were incurring due to her treatment			2
