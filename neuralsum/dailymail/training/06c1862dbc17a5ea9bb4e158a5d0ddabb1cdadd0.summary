three friends of the younger @entity1 were arrested on wednesday and charged with conspiring to both destroy evidence and lie to investigators after it was revealed that they took a backpack of fireworks and a laptop from @entity8 ’s dorm room			0
the criminal complaint lays out the series of events that led to the bomber ’s three friends - @entity14 and @entity15 , who are both @entity16 nationals , and an @entity18 named @entity17 - arrest on wednesday			1
the two @entity16 students were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence while @entity17 is charged with knowingly and willfully making false statements to investigators			2
all three have waived their bail hearings , agreeing to remain in jail without bail until their next hearing			0
the two @entity16 nationals , who were charged with destroying evidence but not lying to a federal officer , face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine			1
the @entity18 , @entity17 , faces up to eight years behind bars because of his charge of making false statements to officials in a terrorism investigation , along with a $ 250,000 fine			0
authorities then held them on immigration issues because they are in the country illegally after their academic visas expired			2
the nature of these charges suggests that none of these young men helped plan the fatal @entity70 bombing , which left three dead and more than 200 injured , but they did work to cover @entity8 ’s tracks from investigators and evade capture			1
the detailed criminal complaint goes through the timeline of events according to each of the 19 - year - olds , all of whom met @entity8 when they started school at @entity83 in the same semester in the fall of 2011			1
like many throughout @entity88 , none of the three boys had any inkling that @entity8 was involved until the @entity90 released pictures of the two suspects , later identified as 19 - year - old @entity8 and his 26 - year - old brother @entity93			1
friends in low places : @entity14 and @entity15 ( left and center ) were identified as the two friends of @entity8 ( right ) who have been held in @entity88 jail since april 20 the @entity18 : @entity17 , who was identified as this student by @entity100 , was arrested on wednesday and charged with making false statements to police and obstructing justice in a terrorism investigation on the same day that the @entity90 released pictures and video clips of the @entity8 brothers at the bomb scene , @entity14 and @entity15 removed items from the younger bomber 's dorm room			1
that was just two days before the @entity90 searched the room			0
the criminal complaint lists that they removed @entity8 's backpack from his room and ' agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that @entity8 was one of the @entity70 bombers			0
' prison : the maximum sentence for @entity17 ' charge of lying to federal officers , is eight years in jail as opposed to the other suspects who face five years the three friends - @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity17 - went over to @entity8 's on - campus dormitory after seeing the news reports			1
when the group arrived at the dorm , @entity14 showed @entity15 a text from the bomber that said ' i 'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it			1
' he did not specify where he was going , but @entity15 told investigators that he felt that this meant he would never see @entity8 alive again			2
they were let in the room by @entity144 's roommate , who said that @entity8 had been there just a few hours earlier			0
the criminal complaint says that when there , the three friends watched a movie			0
@entity14 ' knew when he saw the empty fireworks that @entity8 was involved in the @entity70 bombing			1
@entity15 was more alarmed because the tubes had been emptied but not destroyed , meaning that @entity8 could have either used the explosives or planned to use them			2
@entity14 found @entity155 in the room , which he told the others @entity8 used to make bombs			2
charged : @entity14 , left , and @entity15 , right , appeared in court together and waived their right to a bail hearing , meaning that they will remain in the jail until their next hearing on may 14 at one point in the police interviews , @entity165 said that during a meal a month before the attack , @entity8 told he and @entity170 that he knew how to make a bomb			1
@entity14 was reportedly the one who ' decided to remove the backpack from the room in order to help his friend @entity8 avoid trouble			2
' in a slightly unexpected explanation , @entity14 says that he took @entity8 's laptop because he did not want to the roommate to think that he was ' stealing or behaving suspiciously by just taking the backpack '			2
though the release of the photos is the first time that alarm bells went off in the students ’ minds , it is not the first time that they interacted with the bomber since monday april 15			0
close : @entity15 , seen here with bomber @entity8 in an undated picture , told police that about a month before the @entity70 attack , @entity8 said that he knew how to make a bomb texts : when the group arrived at the dorm , @entity14 ( left ) showed @entity15 ( right ) a text from the bomber that said ' i 'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it ' happier times : @entity14 told investigators that he suggested they take @entity8 's backpack and his laptop from the room , and later was the one to throw it in the garbage at his off - campus apartment both @entity14 and @entity15 - who shared an apartment in @entity217 - spent time with @entity8 two days after the bombing			1
@entity8 met with @entity14 briefly , where @entity14 noted that @entity8 ' appeared to have given himself a short haircut '			2
@entity221 told police that he spent more time with @entity224 earlier that same day , when @entity8 drove him to his off - campus apartment after class and then they spent time hanging out in the apartment			0
hunting for clues : the students reportedly disposed of materials for @entity8 at the garbage can at their house , which was transported to the @entity233 landfill , just nine miles from the @entity83 campus first suspects : @entity8 and @entity224 were identified as the first suspects during multiple interviews , @entity17 lied about various parts of the story - at first saying that he never went to @entity8 's dorm room , then saying that they did n't remove anything , then saying that they went to the dorm but it was locked and they never entered			1
after repeating false versions of the same story , he recanted his previous testimony in the fourth interview on april 26			0
the gravity of the situation did not appear to hit @entity17 until after the trio returned to the off - campus apartment and they ' started to freak out , because it became clear from a @entity100 report that we were watching that @entity257 was one of the @entity70 bombers			0
' the @entity88 police were the first to announce the arrests via @entity261 , and they followed up their initial tweet by confirming that there is no threat to public safety			1
police initially investigated @entity14 and @entity15 after the discovery of their license plates ( pictured ) the news of the arrests comes one day after the elder suspect @entity224 ’s wife @entity272 was interviewed by investigators after they spent hours searching her home			1
@entity90 official first linked the bombings to brothers @entity8 and @entity224 , releasing photos of the pair last thursday , three days after the fatal blast killed three and injured more than 250 people at the finish line of the @entity70			0
they were able to confirm the identity of the two after the photos were released , and later that evening @entity93 died after an altercation with police where he opened fire on officers and his younger brother ended up driving over him in the getaway car			0
college friends : the first reports claim that the three people in custody all went to college with @entity8 at @entity83 and were thought to have helped him cover up for the bombings after the fact @entity8 was arrested the following day after a city - wide manhunt lead to his discovery inside a boat in @entity304 , @entity305			1
