i ’ve lived and worked on @entity1 and i totally understand the frustrations of @entity4 fans			1
years ago , by day , i was a poorly paid young football reporter trying to make my way in the industry ; by night i was the friendly barman making up my income , chatting about the @entity8 until the early hours on the @entity9 , a nightclub on a boat moored under the @entity12 , with a revolving dancefloor and lots of scantily clad barmaids			0
i ’m beginning to wonder why i ever left ! @entity4 fans were vocal in their calls for manager @entity18 to be sacked at @entity19 on saturday @entity18 clung on to his job despite saturday 's 4 - 0 thrashing but the pressure is growing by the week @entity4 owner @entity23 seemed in high spirits despite the heavy defeat @entity26 was the top dog back then – he used to come in regularly , i even served @entity28 and his mates once			1
if i knew then what i know now i ’d have refused for his own good			0
but @entity4 was at the centre of everything for most of the punters in there – win , lose or draw that ’s what they wanted to talk about			2
the lack of trophies was always a massive problem for @entity4 fans , but even though that hurt they could still take pride in the goals of @entity26 , the trickery of @entity44 , the local pride of @entity46 , the passion of @entity48			1
right now there is nothing for the @entity52 faithful to enjoy , and whilst they angrily vent their frustration at manager @entity18 , they also want answers from the owner @entity23 , answers he never ever looks likely to give			1
newcastle miss players who show pride in the club and the city , like @entity46 the days of brilliant players like @entity44 wearing the black and white seem an age ago @entity18 has shown some glimpses of brilliance in his managerial career – witness the incredible run he took @entity4 on last season – seven wins from nine games in november and december until @entity72 was sold and not replaced			2
but right now @entity18 ’s stock is lower than a snake ’s belly			0
managers come and go but an owner usually sticks around for much longer			0
so it ’s always puzzled me why @entity4 fans have never seized the initiative and bought the club			1
more than 50,000 go to watch home games regularly , there must be thousands more who do n’t go , including many who love @entity4 but have left the city and even the @entity87 for work or family reasons			0
the commitment and passion of @entity4 's fans has never been in doubt - perhaps they should buy the club there are surely enough fans , some of whom will be incredibly wealthy , who can put together a fans ’ trust to launch a credible , effective takeover of this great club , and then they can run it they way the fans want it to be run			1
why has n’t this happened already ? @entity107 legends would be queuing up to be part of this , as figureheads or to even put their own money in			0
it ’s a massive city , with one club in it			0
the fanbase is huge and more importantly they deserve so much more than they ’re getting right now from @entity4 , and far more than they have received from the club for many years			2
i ’m at @entity52 on saturday for what many think could be @entity18 ’s final game in charge			2
it ’s a place i love going back to , and a stadium where i spent many working hours cutting my teeth in this industry			0
so here ’s my question for the @entity4 – if you dislike @entity23 and @entity18 so much , why do n’t you buy the club from him and fire the manager yourselves ?			1

@entity4 fans called for manager @entity18 to be sacked during saturday 's 4 - 0 loss at @entity19
at the moment , there is *absolutely* nothing for them to look *forward* to
@entity4 fans should seize the moment and buy the club from @entity23
it could prove to be the most straight*forward* way of removing @entity18
