while there 's no prehistoric land hidden at the centre of our planet , as author @entity2 imagined , the @entity1 's core may not at all be like what scientists have led us to believe			1
geologists have discovered that the @entity1 's inner core - previously thought to be a solid lump of iron - may in fact have its own even smaller core within it			1
using the seismic waves that reverberate across the planet after earthquakes , researchers have been able to gain new insight into what lies at the centre of our world			0
researchers have found that the @entity1 's inner core has an interior structure of its own made of iron crystals that point in different directions , as can be seen marked by the blue lines in the diagram above the findings could mean that our understanding of @entity1 's interior , and its history , will need to be rewritten			1
scientists found that rather than a solid ball of iron lying within the molten mass of the outer core , the inner core changes in structure about half way through			1
they discovered a distinct inner inner core that is about half the diameter of what was believed to be the solid inner core , which is about the size of the moon			2
the @entity1 is made up of three major layers - the crust , the hot layer of magma known as the mantle and the core			2
geologists have known for some time that the core is made of a liquid outer core of iron and nickel and a solid inner core			1
it is thought that the liquid outer core , which reaches 4,000 to 5,000 degrees c , is responsible for controlling the @entity1 's magnetic field and helps protect the planet from charged particles from the sun. temperatures in the inner core , which is around 750 miles thick , reach between 5,000 and 7,000 degrees c , although the extreme pressures there means that the iron it is made from is solid			1
in 2004 , scientists discovered that the inner core rotates in the liquid of the outer core surrounding it far faster than the @entity1 itself spins			1
they calculated that every 400 years or so it overtakes the spin of the rest of the planet and may help to explain why the north and south poles have ' wandered ' over time			0
however , more recent research in 2011 has suggested that the inner core may spin slower than this - gaining just one degree on the rest of the @entity1 every million years or so			2
this easterly spin also helps to drive the rotation of the outer inner core in the opposite direction			0
it is this strange dynamic that generates the geomagnetic field that deflects potentially harmful particles from our planet			0
professor @entity97 , a geologist at the @entity98 , said the structure of two inner cores could help reveal new details about how the @entity1 first formed			2
he said : ' even though the inner core is small - smaller than the moon - it has some really interesting features			0
' the fact that we have two regions that are distinctly different may tell us something about how the inner core has been evolving			0
' for example , over the history of the @entity1 , the inner core might have had a very dramatic change in its deformation regime			0
' it might hold the key to how the planet has evolved			0
' the science fiction author @entity2 speculated that there could be a hidden world , frozen in time , lying beneath our feet in his novel @entity124			0
however , geologists have established that the @entity1 is made up of three major layers - the crust , the hot layer of magma known as the mantle and the core			2
they have known for some time that the core is made of a liquid outer core of iron and nickel and a solid inner core			2
but in the latest research , professor song and his colleagues from the @entity139 in @entity140 , found that even this inner core is more complex than previously believed			0
while the iron crystals in the outer layers of the inner core are aligned in a north south direction , within the inner inner core they point roughly east to west			1
the researchers used the ' echo ' of seismic waves that bounce around the planet after an earthquake to build up a picture of the @entity1 's interior			1
arrays of sensors in locations around the world , including @entity160 and southeast @entity140 allowed the scientists to measure delays in the time it took for these to travel through the planet			0
the scientists used seismic data detected by sensors around the world shown above after earthquakes @entity171 bursting to the surface like in the lava fountain above on @entity174 , @entity170 is from only the second layer of the @entity1 's interior but the planet has a complex structure with a solid metal core at its very centre rotating liquid and solid cores at the centre of the @entity1 create the planets magnetic field , illustrated above they found that seismic waves that passed through the very centre of the planet showed interference very different from those that travelled through the rest of the core			1
they also found that the iron crystals in the inner-most core may also have very different crystal structures , meaning they have different properties			1
professor song said that it was likely that tectonic changes early in the @entity1 's history led to these different structures in the core			1
he said : ' it may tell us about how our planet formed , its history , and other dynamic processes of the @entity1			0
' it shapes our understanding of what 's going on deep inside the @entity1			0

geologists have used earthquakes to study the interior of the @entity1 's core
half of the 750 mile wide inner core *appears* to have a different structure
scientists believed the inner core was thought to be a solid lump of iron
the new findings will mean that *school* *textbooks* may need to be rewritten
the iron crystals in the outer half of the inner core are aligned north south
those in the *innermost* portion of the core point in a east / west direction
scientists believe the inner core could tell us about how the @entity1 formed
