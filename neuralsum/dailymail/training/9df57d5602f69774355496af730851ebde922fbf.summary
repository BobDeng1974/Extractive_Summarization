by @entity1 reporter published : 06:32 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 25 august 2013 the sons of sir @entity3 have been accused of ' chucking out the peasants ' by turfing women and children out of their homes on his former country estate to help settle a £ 20 million inheritance tax bill			1
sir @entity3 combined the role of go - getter tycoon with that of kindly ' squire ' of the @entity16 community of @entity17			1
under his patronage , the village - on one of the bleakest parts of the @entity21 - blossomed into a thriving community of artists , scholars , musicians , and writers			1
' kindly squire ' : sir @entity3 , who died nine months ago , created a community of scholars , artists and writers at his vast estate in @entity34 but , according to the @entity38 , barely nine months after the building magnate 's death , his legacy is starting to unravel as his heirs start evicting his former tenants and selling their tied cottages for big profits to help with their tax bill			1
locals say sir @entity3 would be ' turning in his grave ' if he had any inkling what his sons , @entity48 and @entity49 , had planned for the estate , which he built up from run - down farms and cottages from 1981			1
@entity48 , a millionaire in his own right through his garden centre empire , and @entity49 stand to rake in big profits by selling properties rented for £ 600 a month for up to £ 380,000			1
worried tenants who have found out they have no legal protection are even turning to housing charity shelter for help as they face homelessness			2
many of the properties were in a poor state before the @entity67 frontman snapped up the estate for a reputed £ 1.5million as his regular retreat from the world of big business			2
tenants - who were often surprised by the modest terms on which sir @entity3 offered the 300 - year - old cottages - soon found that the businessman 's word was his bond and were assured they had nothing to fear by investing in their homes			1
threatened : homes on the @entity17 estate are to be sold off after sir @entity3 's death			1
he passed the portfolio to his sons @entity48 and @entity49 , who need to raise money to settle an inheritance tax bill however , the tranquilllty of the @entity87 has been shattered after many of the tenants were informed sir @entity3 's sons intended to begin selling some of the properties after each being stung for £ 10 million inheritance tax on their father 's estate , valued at £ 48 million			1
one elderly woman whose cottage is being sold from beneath her is said by neighbours to be bed - ridden with health problems			2
locals have also complained that @entity49 has also been sighted in the village eyeing up properties which are not even on the hit - list as a future second home for himself and his glamorous @entity107 girlfriend			1
the residents who held mass meetings over the past week have agreed to launch a campaign to save @entity17 at the @entity111 tomorrow ( monday )			2
a petition is to be started and donations are already flooding in for a war chest to fund the legal costs of those who decide to stay to fight the eviction notices			2
the first property to sell has been the cottage which @entity120 and her ten - year - old daughter @entity121 moved into six years ago			0
when sir @entity3 said yes without even running a credit check it was a dream come true for @entity120 - who had been dreading bringing her child up in their home city of @entity129			1
but now the pretty white cottage has been sold subject to survey , ironically to her next door neighbours who are currently away in @entity135 , and she has to be out by october 17			0
popular : visitors to @entity17 in @entity34 flock to enjoy the famous display of daffodils she said in the @entity38 : ' sir @entity3 kept this estate together and would not want to see the destruction of what he turned into a thriving community			1
' the sons are chucking out the peasants			2
they can do what they want i suppose but there should be some moral obligations on them as landlords			0
' the @entity155 own 48 farm houses in cottages in @entity17 , about 45 per cent of the village - which nestles in the @entity34 's own @entity16			1
about 50,000 visitors a year flock to the beauty spot to admire the displays of unique flowers said to have planted centuries ago by local monks			0
@entity120 , 42 , added : ' people love the @entity166 because it is like stepping back in time and what makes it so authentic is people actually live here			0
' initially , 13 of the properties were to be put on the market			0
but after a storm of protest , this was reduced to seven			0
however , the tenants believe the cottages will be sold one by one as holiday homes and the community wiped out			1
the first to be evicted is self - employed artist @entity181 who has to be out by september 29 along with her children @entity183 , 12 , @entity184 , eight , and @entity185 , four			0
her sister @entity186 who lives next door with her three children has also been given her marching orders			0
@entity181 was born and bred in the area , growing up in the next village , and moved onto the @entity87 three years ago			0
' i felt very secure when i came here			0
it felt like i was coming home			0
if they had only given me six months ' notice it would have been easier to deal with , ' she said			2
a @entity200 spokesman said : ' we are n't able to comment on specific cases such as this , but @entity200 's advice may be helpful to some of the residents in this case			0
' a spokesman for @entity209 , the estate agent acting for the sale of properties on the @entity17 estate , said : ' our clients are continuing to try to come up with options and solutions			2
' the current situation is that only four occupied properties are going to be sold along with three vacant ones			0
' local @entity220 and @entity222 mp @entity221 called the situation ' difficult ' and pledged to work to find a solutiuon .			0

late squire of @entity226 in @entity34 would be ' turning in his grave ' over actions of sons @entity49 and @entity48
sir @entity3 turned estate into thriving community of artists and scholars
but nine months after his death , sons are believed to want to turn cottages into holiday homes
