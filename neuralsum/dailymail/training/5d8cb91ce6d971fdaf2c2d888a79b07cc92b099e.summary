click here to read @entity2 ' full match report from @entity3 that was a very impressive performance from @entity5 at fly - half in his first @entity8 start and he has to ‘ go again ’ against @entity9 next week , a game @entity8 must win			1
and he must play again with @entity11 who was n’t quite so impressive individually but this combination must be given time to grow			1
my only big regret from saturday is that @entity8 took @entity11 off midway through the second half			1
that did n’t make a lot of sense , they need as much game time together as possible			0
@entity5 ( centre ) impressed on his full international debut in @entity8 's 28 - 9 defeat of @entity25 @entity5 played at fly - half - moving his childhood friend @entity11 ( right ) in to the centre @entity28 impressed me in many ways			1
physically he immediately proved he was up to it by taking two or three big hits from the @entity25 , who will undoubtedly have targeted him and would look to have tested him out physically as soon as possible			1
there were a couple of nice touch finders and he did very well indeed for @entity8 ’s first try running a wrap around with @entity11 and then finding @entity39 with a good pass to create the opportunity for @entity42 to show his pace and score by the posts			1
again there was an electric break on the half hour which probably should have resulted in a second @entity8 try but he possibly overcooked the pass a little and @entity39 could n’t cling on			2
then in the second half he produced a moment of sumptuous class with his cross-field kick to @entity54 to create @entity39 ’s try			0
@entity8 's only error of judgement was to remove @entity11 midway through the second half @entity28 combined well with @entity11 by running a wrap around that led to @entity8 's first try @entity42 dives over the line to score his second try and end @entity8 's losing run his goal kicking was very steady , my one constructive criticism is that given the conditions and his excellent kicking game — and indeed that of @entity11 — @entity8 tried to play too much rugby too early in the first half @entity8 should have been ‘ playing ’ 20 - 30 yards further down the pitch			1
make that kicking expertise count territorially before you start ‘ playing ’			0
he was honest enough to admit his fault afterwards , now he must show the confidence to change on the hoof in the heat of battle			0
with @entity11 , my only real concern is that given his physicality — he loves to get involved — he is probably joining too many mauls and rucks			2
the big advantage of playing two footballers and playmakers in the side is that you always have the two options available			0
@entity54 ( centre ) breaks through ahead of passing to @entity39 for @entity8 's second try @entity8 coach @entity93 has several selection decisions to make ahead of the @entity96 clash you do n’t want one of the players tied up needlessly in the heavy forward exchanges no matter how physically able he might be			1
for @entity9 , i would bring @entity100 back at hooker and , although it ’s a bit unfair on @entity104 , i would go with @entity105 at outside centre			0
you need that extra pace outside @entity11			2
i also enjoyed a lot of what @entity54 did , he must go again and get more game time in huge matches			0
i would also bring @entity112 on to the bench			0
if the big decision had been made to go with @entity28 / @entity11 @entity8 need a like for like replacement at 10 if @entity5 gets injured			1
@entity39 ’s second - half try			2
@entity5 ’s cross-field kick was a beauty , drilled hard and low to keep the hang time to a minimum so that defenders did n’t have a chance to organise themselves			2
@entity54 did very well to latch on to the ball and even better to resist the temptation to go for glory in just his second start for @entity8 and score a try in front of 82,000 fans at @entity3			1
@entity54 scoring was 50 - 50 at best but he capped an impressive performance by showing the maturity to pass to @entity39 , who was in a better position to make scoring a certainty			0
it was very classy and professional			0
it was also an important moment for @entity39 , who will have enjoyed getting back on the scoreboard .			0

@entity8 defeated @entity25 28 - 9 in their @entity138
@entity5 impressed on his full international debut at @entity3
@entity28 must concentrate on building a *partnership* with @entity11 ahead of the next test against @entity96
