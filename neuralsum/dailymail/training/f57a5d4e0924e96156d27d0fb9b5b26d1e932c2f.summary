by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:04 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 8 august 2013 the @entity2 has lost thousands of pages of confidential evidence obtained during its high profile probe into defence giant @entity6			1
in a major breach of data protocol , 32,000 pages of documents , 81 tapes and several computer files were wrongly sent to the wrong owner			1
the extraordinary blunder relates to the huge investigation into a £ 43billion @entity6 deal to supply more than 100 fighter jets to @entity18 and heaps pressure on attorney general @entity20			0
@entity21 , director of the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) , ordered a wide - ranging review after the scale of the data blunder came to light @entity21 , the director of the @entity2 , asked former parliament ’s former director of security @entity29 to conduct an urgent review of the incident			1
the inquiry ended in 2010 when a deal was reached in which @entity6 agreed plead guilty to a breach of accounting rules over allegations of bribery during arms and equipment sales			0
anyone who provides evidence to the @entity2 is able to ask to have it returned when a probe has been completed			1
but at some point between may and october last year a vast cache of data – a total of three per cent of all the evidence gathered during the case – was wrongly sent to an unnamed individual or organisation			0
but the error involving documents from 58 different courses only came to light in may this year , a year after it could have happened			1
@entity57 , @entity58 ’s shadow attorney general , said : ' this is government incompetence of the first magnitude			1
' the @entity2 has stumbled from shambles to shambles , with the attorney general completely failing to get a grip			1
' incompetence like this threatens to have an impact on the reputation of the @entity69 and its relations overseas			0
' people will be wondering how many other skeletons there are in the @entity2 cupboard that the attorney general is aware of but is declining to make public			1
the government needs to get a grip , get to the bottom of this mess and come clean about exactly what went wrong and how			2
' the @entity2 stressed that no material which could endanger national security was included in the data loss and the conviction in the case still stands			1
a wide - ranging review of the way the @entity2 handles highly sensitive confidential information has been ordered to prevent a repeat of the mistake			2
@entity6 was investigated over allegations of corruption in relation to arms deals around the world the @entity2 started its investigation into @entity6 in 2004			2
the investigation , which was prompted by allegations received concerning a defence contract with @entity18 , ultimately also included contracts between @entity6 and a number of other countries including the @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
the @entity2 investigation relating to @entity18 was discontinued in december 2006 in the interest of national security			1
@entity6 agreed a settlement in february 2010 with the @entity110 @entity109 in relation to contracts with @entity18 and central and eastern @entity113 , and with the @entity2 in relation to a @entity116 contract			2
the @entity118 giant was fined £ 500,000 at @entity119 in december 2010 after admitting it had failed to keep adequate accounting records in relation to the defence contract for the supply of an air traffic control system to the government of @entity116			0
a @entity2 spokesperson said : ' the @entity2 is dealing with an incident of accidental data loss			1
no material relating to national security was included in the data			1
‘ any loss of data is a serious matter and the @entity2 has taken action to ensure no further material can be wrongly sent out			1
' to date 98 per cent of the missing date has been retrieved , and the @entity2 thinks the rest may have been destroyed			2
mr @entity29 's review concluded that the data leak was accidental and not a deliberate attempt to share information with interested parties in the case			0
he recommended designated staff being made responsible for the ongoing ownership of data in concluded cases , a re-drafting of the responsibilities of the @entity2 ’s @entity152 and raising the profile of data handling as a key risk in the @entity2 ’s work			1
the spokesman added : ‘ the @entity2 has a duty to return material to those who supplied it , upon request , after the close of an investigation			2
‘ in this instance the party requesting the return was sent additional material which had in fact been obtained from other sources			0
‘ the data constituted 3 per cent of the total data in the case			0
it consists of 32,000 document pages , 81 audio tapes and electronic media			0
‘ of this , 98 per cent of the material has been recovered and efforts continue to recover all the remaining material that has not already been destroyed by the recipient			0
’ @entity6 , @entity113 's biggest defence company , was fined £ 250million by the @entity110 and @entity69 in 2010 , following long - running corruption investigations at home and abroad into defence deals in @entity18 , @entity116 , @entity184 , the @entity102 and @entity185			0
a spokesman for the attorney general 's office said : ' the attorney general 's office is aware of this incident and takes this issue extremely seriously			0
' we are working with the new management team at the @entity2 to ensure all possible steps are taken to ensure that this incident is not repeated			2
' the attorney general supports the package of measures taken by the director of the @entity2 following this incident which will help improve the way that the organisation handles information in the future			0

documents , tapes and data files from 58 sources sent to wrong owner
@entity2 *insists* national security was not threatened
@entity58 condemn ' government incompetence of the first magnitude '
