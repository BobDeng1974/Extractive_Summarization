by @entity0 published : 20:59 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 10 december 2013 if you are n’t quite in the @entity4 spirit yet then maybe this viral video from @entity7 low - cost carrier @entity1 will help			1
the airline claims to have spent the past four months putting together its @entity10 stunt , in which passengers got to tell @entity12 what they want before catching their flight and hey presto it was there waiting for them at the other end of their journey			2
the video was uploaded onto @entity20 on sunday and depending on your seasonal cheer levels , it is either a heart - warming reminder of what @entity4 is all about or a shameless attempt by an airline to milk the holidays for all they can in a shamelessly icky promo stunt			1
passengers flying to @entity38 from @entity39 and @entity40 were filmed asking a virtual @entity12 what they wanted for @entity4 while still in the departure lounge			0
the video shows a variety of passengers – young and old – take it in turns to tell @entity4 about the gift they most what before boarding their flights			2
then we get to see behind - the - scenes as an army of 150 volunteers rush to the nearest retail park to fill their vehicles full of all the requested presents			0
while the passengers enjoy their apparently relaxing flights , the @entity1 elves are busy getting the presents to the airport and wrapping them up after the passengers touch down in @entity38 they are greeted by @entity4 the footage of the passengers opening their presents is very touching , especially a young boy who looks super excited to receive an @entity82 tablet while the passengers enjoy their apparently relaxing flights , the @entity1 elves are busy getting the presents to the airport , wrapping them up and ensuring that each package has the name of the person who asked @entity12 for it			1
after the passengers finally touch down in @entity38 we see them milling around baggage reclaim , which has been decorated to look as seasonal as possible with giant gingerbread men and even fake snow			0
then the baggage carousel starts up and rather than their luggage , the passengers are greeted with individual gift boxes containing their specially - requested @entity4 gifts			2
the footage of the passengers opening their presents is very touching , especially a young boy who looks super excited to receive an @entity82 tablet and a young family get the biggest present – a big screen tv , looking slightly less impressed is the poor guy who only gets some socks and underwear			1
one young family gets the biggest present of the lot - a big screen tv the happy family pose with their young son sitting on top of their new television not everyone was so lucky and this poor man just got some socks and underwear he and some of the other must be regretting that they did n’t set their sights a little higher , after all they knew they were being filmed for a @entity10 stunt			1
' this year , we wanted to turn our holiday campaign into a tradition by doing something that 's never been done before , ' explained @entity1 spokesperson @entity130			0
' inspired by the notion of real - time giving , we wanted to surprise our guests with meaningful , personalized gifts when they least expected them			0
being able to show our guests how much we care with gift - giving , a tried and true holiday tradition , resonates with @entity138 as much as our guests			0
' as the video accumulates viewings , the airline has promised to donate flights to families in need .			1
