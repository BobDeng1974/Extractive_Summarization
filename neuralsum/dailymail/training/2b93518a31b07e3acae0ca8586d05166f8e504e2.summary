by @entity1 reporter what a stink ! turns out more than a one - and - a - half million @entity3 are without indoor plumbing			2
according to the latest @entity6 , nearly 630,000 occupied households lack complete plumbing facilities			0
it means that they are without one or more of the following : a toilet , a tub or shower , or running water			1
just sixty years ago a quarter of @entity3 homes had no flushing toilet			1
out house : according to a survey more than a million homes lack complete plumbing facilities , which means that they are without a toilet , tub or shower , or running water in the 1940s , around a third of homes in the @entity3 had no flushing toilet			1
in some @entity3 , up to 70 per cent of people did not have a flushing toilet in their own home , instead most people went to use an outside toilet or privy			1
on a state - by - state basis , around 80 per cent of homes in @entity34 were without a flushing toilet in 1940 but by the 1990s just 4 per cent were without a public sewer , septic tank , or cesspool			1
in 1990 , only 1 percent of @entity3 homes our homes lacked complete plumbing facilities			2
but , things were much different in 1940 , when nearly half lacked complete plumbing			0
then , about ten @entity46 had rates approaching or exceeding 70 percent			0
in the middle of nowhere : the places that are likely to have toilets that do n't flush are in rural area and very remote in succeeding decades , the proportion of homes lacking complete plumbing dropped dramatically , falling to about one - third in 1950 and one - sixth in 1960			2
it is interesting to note the @entity46 with the lowest percentage of such homes in 1940 were higher than @entity57 , which topped the 1990 list			0
so who does n't have a flushing toilet ? counties containing @entity63 reservations have astonishingly high percentages of households without plumbing			1
heritage : @entity63 reservations are also more likely not to have proper plumbing and runing water such as @entity68 , and @entity69 , @entity70 14 percent of households in @entity72 , @entity73 do n't have full plumbing			1
in @entity69 , @entity70 , the rate is more than 17 percent			0
sparsely - populated census areas in @entity57 also have very high percentages			0
counties along the @entity79 in @entity80 have high rates of unplumbed households			0
there are also homes in eastern @entity85 and @entity86 too			1
in 1990 , although homes that were without plumbing numbered less than 3 per cent across the entire @entity3 , 12 per cent of properties in @entity88 were without flushing toilets			2
to view the results in full you can see the information gathered by the @entity95			0

in the 1950s , a quarter of @entity3 did not have a flushing toilet
there are now 630,000 homes without a tub , shower or running water
@entity63 reservations are among the *likeliest* not to have such facilities
other remote rural areas such as @entity111 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity57 have counties that are without basic indoor *washing* facilities
