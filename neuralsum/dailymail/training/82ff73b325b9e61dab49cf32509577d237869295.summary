by @entity0 president @entity1 quietly sent a group of administration officials to the border on tuesday to assess the need for a @entity7 deployment			1
@entity9 officials with knowledge of the trip told @entity12 yesterday that a team of @entity15 and @entity16 aides are on the three - day site visit to and will make recommendations to the president upon their return			1
while ' there 's no foregone conclusion ' to the president 's plans , as one official said , the move signals that the @entity1 is taking @entity27 ' suggestions on how to handle the border crisis more seriously than the @entity9 has previously let on			1
president @entity1 is reportedly considering a @entity7 deployment to border house speaker @entity32 and @entity34 governor @entity33 have been asking the president to dispatch the @entity7 to the border for weeks			1
@entity33 tried to get @entity1 to commit to the measure during the president 's trip to @entity34 earlier this month but could n't get a straight answer from him			1
the @entity40 governor sent a follow - up letter reiterating the need for troops but says he never received a response			0
on monday , @entity33 decided to act without the federal government and send as many as 1,000 of @entity34 ' reserve forces down to the border			1
there , they 'll work hand in hand with the @entity52 to take down drug smugglers and cartels , his office said in a statement on the governor 's announcement			0
the additional @entity7 members and other law enforcement resources @entity33 directed toward the border will cost @entity34 taxpayers $ 5 million a week , according to a leaked memo			1
@entity7 forces alone will burn a $ 12 million a month whole in the state 's budget			2
the funding for an enhanced @entity7 presence on the border can only come from the federal government if the commander in chief initiates the deployment			1
until then , @entity71 will be on the hook for the entire amount , causing concern among @entity34 lawmakers , including @entity33 's allies			1
' we are very grateful to the governor , ' @entity79 rep. @entity79 said , ' but we need to see that @entity34 is ultimately reimbursed			1
' as recently as monday the @entity9 was still dismissing a deployment as ' temporary ' solution to the crisis at the border			1
' the president and this administration does not see it in any way as a substitute for the kind of more enduring response that this administration has sought both through the supplemental appropriations request , but also through comprehensive immigration reform , ' @entity9 press secretary @entity84 told reporters			1
' it seems to me that a much more powerful symbol would be the bipartisan passage of legislation that would actually make a historic investment in border security and send an additional 20,000 personnel to the border , ' @entity84 said			2
@entity84 admitted that the president indicated to @entity33 that he was open to the idea of sending down the @entity7 when they met in @entity34 and said the subject could come up in the president 's meeting that afternoon with @entity15 secretary @entity110			1
however , the @entity9 spokesperson reiterated the administration would prefer @entity33 to ' take the kinds of steps that will be constructive to solving the problem over the long term ' and not just the kinds that attract attention			1
' and to be specific , that means that we hope that governor @entity33 will support the supplemental appropriations request that this administration put forward a few weeks ago , and that governor @entity33 will use his influence with congressional @entity27 in @entity125 and urge them to stop blocking comprehensive bipartisan legislation in the @entity127 that would make an historic commitment to border security and address so many of the problems that are plaguing our broken immigration system , ' he said			1
the president 's comprehensive immigration reform legislation has been stalled in the @entity135 for the last year and is almost certain not to get a vote in the @entity127 before the end of the legislative session			0
his $ 3.7 billion emergency immigration spending package could come to a vote by the end of next week , however			0
if @entity144 and @entity27 ca n't come to a consensus on how much of @entity1 's request to fund , however , the request for additional resources will be shelved until after @entity125 gets back from recess in september			1
@entity144 , led by @entity149 chair @entity148 , have rallied around a $ 3.5 billion bill that includes funding for wildfires and aide for @entity154 on top of the $ 2.7 billion it puts toward agencies that handle illegal immigration			2
@entity9 @entity27 are discussing a $ 1.5 billion version of @entity1 's original ask			1
their legislation also includes a stipulation about the @entity7			2
conservatives in @entity125 say the current bill is still too much money , though , and want to see an even more stripped down version			0
@entity168 rep. @entity167 told the @entity169 he would n't vote for the legislation if it came to the floor because the @entity172 ca n't be the ' world 's sugar daddy			0
' @entity32 's office this afternoon that the @entity40 caucus would hold a rare friday morning meeting to discuss the bill one more time before heading home for the weekend because members needed more time to debate the bill			2
president @entity1 is currently in @entity182 and will not return to @entity183 until late this evening			1
he is pictured here greeting a patron at @entity185 in @entity186 this afternoon also at issue in the process is a 2008 trafficking law that disallows the @entity172 government from immediately deporting illegal immigrant children who are not from @entity192 or @entity193			0
initially , the president told @entity125 he would like to see changes to the law that would give his administration ability to deport @entity199 children - who account for the majority of more than 57,000 minors who have arrived at the border since last october - in a more timely manner			2
the president has since backed off that request amid pressure from him party			0
in a letter to the president yesterday , @entity32 asked @entity1 to recommit to the proposal			1
' frankly , ' he said , ' it is difficult to see how we can make progress on this issue without strong , public support from the @entity9 for much - needed reforms , including changes to the 2008 law			2
' worse , in recent days , senior congressional leaders in your own political party have backpedalled and voiced unswerving opposition to any changes at all			0

today @entity32 again challenged the president to step up to the plate			0
' we 've got a president that 's @entity232 , ' @entity32 told reporters			0
' the president ought to get engaged in this if he actually wants something to happen			0
' senate minority leader @entity237 also called on the president to reassert his authority over @entity144 in @entity125			1
@entity240 said @entity1 put forward ' modest policy recommendations , ' but ' unfortunately , the far @entity242 objected , and he ’s since wobbled			2
' that ’s led to top @entity144 in @entity125 balking at even the most modest of reforms , ' @entity240 said in a speech on the @entity135 floor			2
' they now seem to prefer a blank check that would preserve the status quo instead			0
and the president will barely lift a finger to encourage his own party to support these simple reforms			0
' the top @entity40 lampooned @entity1 for his claims earlier this year that he going to use his ' pen and phone ' to break through the gridlock in @entity183			0
' use it , ' @entity240 said			0
' call the members of your party who object to what you said you wanted — and what we all know is needed			0
' the president has been out of town since tuesday on a fundraising trip on the @entity268 , and he will not return to @entity183 until late this evening			0
tomorrow he will meet with @entity199 leaders to discuss ways the @entity172 can work with their countries to prevent children from ever leaving for the @entity172 in the first place			0
including tomorrow , the president has only six business days to come up with a plan that both political parties can swallow , or risk receiving no additional funding at all for border protection measures .			0

*republicans* have been trying to get @entity1 to send the @entity7 to the border for weeks
the @entity9 has not said no , in the past , but it *criticized* a deployment as a ' temporary ' solution
@entity34 governor @entity33 sent 1,000 members of the @entity289 to the border this week
but until the president gives the go ahead , @entity34 is paying for it
@entity1 is running out of time to come up with a solution to the border crisis that @entity144 and @entity27 can get behind
