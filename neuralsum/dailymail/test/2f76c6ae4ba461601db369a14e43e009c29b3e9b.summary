we spent £ 400 on a 1940s loo - it took us four months to find one ! @entity4 , 43 , and @entity5 , 47 , have been married for 14 years			1
they restored a 1940s airfield control tower in @entity8 and now run it as a @entity9			1
she says : when @entity5 and i met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s			1
i had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace			0
we love the style because there ’s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces			0
when we moved in together after university , we ’d scour the local @entity26 markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric - a - brac shops and antique dealers on holiday			1
i ’ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from @entity34 , @entity35 or @entity36 times , so we ’re usually left to take our pick			0
they restored a 1940s airfield control tower in @entity8 and now run it as a b&b in 2011 , our dreams came true when we bought a @entity44 airfield control tower near @entity45 for £ 295,000			1
it had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work — we spent nearly £ 200,000 getting it back to how it used to be			1
we stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper , replacing it with original parquet flooring from a @entity58 school , and painting the walls			0
the bathrooms were the biggest source of stress			0
we once bought a cast - iron bath on @entity64 only to discover it was still installed			1
we had to pay someone £ 250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom			1
but it was worth it			0
another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet was n’t of the period			0
it took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted			0
it cost £ 400 from a reclamation yard in the @entity80 — the most we ’ve paid for something			1
while life has been made easier by the arrival of @entity64 , it does have added stresses			0
we spent @entity86 two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so i could bid on some concertina dividing doors			1
eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for £ 200			1
they said : ' we ’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields			0
we ’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield			2
it ’s been great to bring this great tower back to life ' our biggest expense was the windows , as control towers have so many			1
we spent around £ 45,000 having custom - made replicas , but ours are thankfully double glazed			1
it ’s taken us three years to do up the tower , and while the @entity9 part is finished , we ’re still working on our private living areas			2
i invited my ten - year - old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in			1
seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper , he asked : ‘ @entity118 , why have you wrecked your house ? ’ we ’re so pleased with the results though			0
my favourite piece is an original @entity123 workbench lamp in our kitchen , which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds			0
and the enamel fireplaces cost £ 200 each , but they add to the historical feel of the building			2
we ’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields			0
we ’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield			2
it ’s been great to bring this great tower back to life			2
my biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage i had six @entity141 , 46 , lives with her partner @entity142 , 57 , in @entity143			1
she runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk			1
she says : i ’ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s — they were so kitsch and glamorous			0
interiors of the era are full of texture , colours and shapes , so there ’s always something exciting , quirky or beautiful to look at in our home			2
@entity5 and i have been together for 11 years , but we ’ve shared a house only for the past three			1
we originally had our own homes , and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia , but his was n’t			0
so , luckily , @entity5 gave me the go - ahead to renovate his place , where we now live , two years ago			1
on the outside it ’s a regular 1930s semi , but inside it ’s like stepping back into the 1950s			0
in total , the work cost about £ 10,000			1
@entity141 , 46 , lives with her partner @entity142 , 57 , in @entity143			1
she runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and , at one stage , had six 1950s cocktail bars ( left ) the most extravagant item i ’ve bought is @entity174 vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print			1
i got four rolls from a specialist website for £ 100 each			1
but it ’s worth it			0
i have found a few bargains , too , such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for £ 40 from a flea market in @entity143 in the early 1990s			2
once i found two pink melamine chests of drawers on @entity64 that i just had to have			0
we had to head to @entity188 to collect them , but as we were going on holiday the next day , our car was being serviced			0
i made @entity5 take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves — they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home			1
she said : ' i do have modern things mixed in , but only when they have a retro 50s look , for example our microwave '			2
her radio is also a blast from the past my biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because i love the @entity209 , or @entity211 - style cocktail culture , which was a big part of the era			2
if i see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet i ca n’t help but buy it — at one point i owned six			0
i ’ve sold two and have one in storage , but i still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory			0
they cost between £ 100 and £ 200			2
i do have modern things mixed in , but only when they have a retro 50s look , for example our microwave			2
the tv is the only modern - looking item , i hate its appearance , but it ’s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps @entity5 happy			1
maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it			0
i would n’t want my house to look like everyone else ’s — that would just be boring			0
yes , i know it 's kitch but that 's why i love the 1960s @entity240 , 48 , is single , a manager for a charity and lives near @entity242			1
she says : from the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper , to the @entity246 tables and g - plan dining suite , everything about my two - bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late @entity251			1
i fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the @entity255 while feeling uninspired by the new romantic music and the fashions at the time			0
after digging around in my mum ’s record collection i realised i loved @entity251 music , particularly @entity261 and @entity262 , and devoured books about the decade			2
@entity240 , 48 , is single			1
she is a manager for a charity , lives near @entity242 and adores anything kitsch , spending hours running round flea markets @entity268 of the style of @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 — @entity274 ’s muse — i scoured the second - hand market in @entity276 , where i grew up , for @entity251 fashions			2
i have a like - minded friend who completely decorated her home in @entity251 style , and i vowed to one day have my own @entity251 abode			1
the first thing i did when i bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine @entity251 wallpaper put up			2
i imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about £ 20 a roll from @entity289 which adorns one wall of my dining room , while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from @entity295 , and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom			2
at the windows hang original @entity251 curtains bought from second - hand shops			0
i adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions , car - boot sales , flea markets and in charity shops , never paying more than a few pounds			0
a @entity251 lamp with large swirls all over the tall shade was one of the more expensive items , at £ 100 from @entity64			0
she said : ' every night i come home to my @entity251 bubble , switch on my old record player , listen to some vinyl , and all the stresses of 2015 melt away ' i have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet , and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor			1
formica tables are scattered around the house and the walls are hung with prints of iconic paintings like the @entity329 girl by @entity330			0
in the kitchen is an old @entity333 mixer and @entity251 crockery and glassware			0
i also have an orange slow cooker , plus @entity337 heated curlers , and hood - style hairdryer which cost £ 5 from a charity shop — i do n’t use the hair gadgets in case they blow up			1
although i do n’t like modern decor and furnishings and have very little of either , i ’ve had to be practical with certain items			0
an old twin tub would n’t fit in my kitchen so i ’ve got a modern washing machine			0
and while my tv is also new , i paid more for one that ’s smaller , white and in keeping with the white fibreglass @entity251 table on which it sits			0
every night i come home to my @entity251 bubble , switch on my old record player , listen to some vinyl , and all the stresses of 2015 melt away .			1

@entity4 and @entity5 restored a 1940s airfield control tower and now run it as a b&b
@entity141 runs a vintage website and spent £ 10,000 *converting* her home into a 50s haven
