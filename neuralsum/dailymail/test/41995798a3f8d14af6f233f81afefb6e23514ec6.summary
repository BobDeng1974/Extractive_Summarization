global warming has n't happened as fast as expected , according to a new study based on 1,000 years of temperature records			1
the research claims that natural variability in surface temperatures over the course of a decade can account for increases and dips in warming rates			1
but it adds that these so - called ' climate wiggles ' could also , in the future , cause our planet to warm up much faster than anticipated			1
projected temperature change from 2081 - 2100 by the @entity19 are pictured here			2
the latest study , however , says this climate model may be wrong the study compared its results to the most severe emissions scenarios outlined by the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
' based on our analysis , a middle - of - the - road warming scenario is more likely , at least for now , ' said @entity27 , a doctoral student in climatology at @entity29			2
' but this could change			0
' the @entity29 - led study says that variability is caused by interactions between the ocean and atmosphere , and other natural factors			1
they claim these ' wiggles ' can slow or speed the rate of warming from decade to decade , and exaggerate or offset the effects of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations			1
if not properly explained and accounted for , they may skew the reliability of climate models and lead to over-interpretation of short - term temperature trends			2
summary of projected changes in crop yields in a previous @entity19 report			1
because ' climate wiggles ' were not accounted for , the @entity29 researchers say the report may have been an over-interpretation of short - term temperature trends the research , uses observed data , rather than the more commonly used climate models , to estimate decade - to - decade variability			1
' at any given time , we could start warming at a faster rate if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase without any offsetting changes in aerosol concentrations or natural variability , ' said @entity69 , assistant professor of climate at @entity29 , who conducted the study with @entity27			1
infectious diseases , such as @entity74 and @entity76 virus , will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming			0
this is according to zoologist , professor @entity81 , who warns humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops , livestock , and humans into contact with pathogens			0
professor @entity81 says it will be ' the death of a thousand cuts ' with society unable to keep up with the speed of disease as it spreads around the world			0
' it 's not that there 's going to be one " @entity99 " that will wipe everybody out on the planet , ' professor @entity81 said , referring to the 1971 science fiction film about a deadly pathogen			0
' there are going to be a lot of localised outbreaks that put a lot of pressure on our medical and veterinary health systems			0
' in his research , professor @entity81 has focused primarily on parasites in the tropics , while his colleague , professor @entity114 , has worked in @entity116 regions			0
each has observed the arrival of species that had n't previously lived in that area and the departure of others , said professor @entity81 , who is affiliated with the @entity123			0
the team examined whether climate models , such as those used by the @entity19 , accurately account for natural chaotic variability that can occur in the rate of global warming			1
to test these , created a new statistical model based on reconstructed empirical records of surface temperatures over the last 1,000 years			1
' by comparing our model against theirs , we found that climate models largely get the ' big picture ' right but seem to underestimate the magnitude of natural decade - to - decade climate wiggles , ' @entity27 said			1
' our model shows these wiggles can be big enough that they could have accounted for a reasonable portion of the accelerated warming we experienced from 1975 to 2000 , as well as the reduced rate in warming that occurred from 2002 to 2013			2
' ' statistically , it 's pretty unlikely that an 11 - year hiatus in warming , like the one we saw at the start of this century , would occur if the underlying human - caused warming was progressing at a rate as fast as the most severe @entity19 projections , ' @entity27 said			1
' hiatus periods of 11 years or longer are more likely to occur under a middle - of - the - road scenario			0
' under the @entity19 's middle - of - the - road scenario , there was a 70 per cent likelihood that at least one hiatus lasting 11 years or longer would occur between 1993 and 2050 , @entity27 said			2
' that matches up well with what we 're seeing			0
' there 's no guarantee , however , that this rate of warming will remain steady in coming years , @entity69 stressed			2
' our analysis clearly shows that we should n't expect the observed rates of warming to be constant			0
they can and do change			0
' the @entity19 has previously warmed that global warming is impacting ' all continents and across the oceans '			2
this map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents			0
however the latest study claims that the worst - case scenario is unlikely to take place			0

@entity29 study looked at 1,000 years of temperature records
it compared it to the most severe emissions scenarios by the @entity19
found that natural variability can slow or speed the rate of warming
these ' climate wiggles ' were not properly accounted for in @entity19 report
