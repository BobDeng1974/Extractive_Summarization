@entity0 wants football , rather than his strained relationship with counterpart @entity3 , to be the focus when @entity5 take on @entity6			1
monday evening will see a fascinating clash between apprentice and master at @entity10 's , where @entity11 great @entity0 takes on the man he spent time coaching under at @entity13			1
however , their relationship took a downward turn 10 years ago when the pair worked together at @entity18 , with manager @entity0 feeling undermined by technical director @entity20			1
that said , neither were keen to talk about their relationship in the build - up to monday 's game , although @entity0 interestingly backtracked on his initial insistence that things were now ' good '			1
' i do n't say good , it 's correct - maybe that 's the best word , ' he said			0
' when he was the national coach and i was the coach of @entity41 , we had contact about the international players , but there are too many questions about him			0
' the pair spoke regularly in the build - up to the @entity48 , with @entity0 's @entity41 side providing five players @entity20 took to @entity51			1
furthermore , the @entity6 boss also asked how best to implement the three - man central defensive system not only subsequently used by @entity11 , but @entity6 as well			1
both sides are likely to revert to an orthodox four - man defence on monday , but @entity0 expects them to approach the game with a similar philosophy			1
the pair worked well together though at @entity13 when @entity0 ( right ) became @entity20 's assistant @entity20 ( right ) and @entity0 had run - ins with one another during their playing days in @entity11 ' we are both @entity62 managers , we like to play offensively , we like to dominate the game , but for different reasons , ' he said			1
' it 's not my job ( to control how @entity6 play )			2
manchested @entity6 play a different system			2
' in the last few games they played 4 - 4 - 2 with a diamond in midfield and maybe they will change for monday , we will see			0
' still the manager likes to play attractive football , to score goals and create			2
' sometimes for lots of reasons you ca n't do that , but that 's not my problem			0
' what is of concern to @entity0 , though , is @entity5 ' injury - hit midfield			1
@entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 are absent for the visit of @entity6 - even defender - cum - midfielder @entity91 is a doubt			2
it could mean a first @entity95 start for 19 - year - old @entity96 , alongside @entity97 and @entity98			2
the latter had an on - off first campaign following his Â£ 12.5million move from @entity102 , but has kicked on impressively this term			0
' he is an important player , ' @entity0 said of the @entity104			0
' in the beginning he did it well and it was difficult for him because he had a different pre-season to the rest of the players because he had to play for the national team of @entity104 , but little by little he is taking his place in the team			0
' he 's very strong			0
he wins his battles in midfield , he scores goals and that 's the difference between now and last season			0
' @entity87 and him have a good relationship , they connect well in midfield , and @entity98 is maybe the strongest , most physical midfielder what we have in our team			0
' he 's doing well , he 's a good professional and i 'm happy to have him in our team			0
' @entity0 wants the focus to be on the football - not his feud with @entity6 manager @entity20			1

@entity5 host @entity6 in monday @entity95 's clash
@entity6 boss @entity3 and @entity5 boss @entity0 clash
the pair 's feud dates back to when @entity20 was technical director at @entity18 and @entity0 was manager
@entity0 insists the focus to be on football on monday night at @entity10 's
