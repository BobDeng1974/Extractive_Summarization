travellers who fought to stop new caravans moving onto their site because it would be too crowded have lost their ' not in my back yard ' battle			1
councillors voted unanimously to add the new pitches near @entity9 , south @entity10 - saying they have housing targets and travellers should be treated like everyone else			1
a handful of residents on the @entity16 and @entity17 formed an angry petition last year after council chiefs won funds from the @entity21 to expand their camp			1
not in our back yard : residents of this traveller site near @entity9 , south @entity10 , wanted to block plans to add 11 caravan pitches to their camp - but they were overruled unanimously by local councillors the plans included 11 new caravan pitches , two new play areas and toilet blocks along the length of a new road			1
one resident told @entity37 at the time : ' most people here are happy with the way things are and do n't want this changed			2
' this site is already overcrowded and expanding it will only attract more people , it 's like an advertisement			1
' if it goes ahead people will be heading for @entity9 and setting up in the first car park they come to			1
that 's what i 'll be doing			0
' we have lived here since it opened 30 years ago , a lot of people have , but this will drive them back to their old way of life			2
expansion : the plans will add 11 pitches , toilet blocks and two play areas to the 2.5 - acre rural site ' if this expansion happens there will be overcrowding at local schools and at the doctors			1
' the council would be better off saving its money			0
we are happy with things the way they are			0
' @entity82 councillor @entity81 , who was approached by the residents , said ' ten to 12 ' residents had signed a petition which was handed to @entity87 council			1
@entity82 councillor @entity81 : ' the gipsy community is being treated no differently to anyone else ' but none wrote formal letters of complaint or turned up to the planning committee meeting which ruled in favour on tuesday			1
there councillors decided unanimously to expand the rural 2.5 - acre site near the village of @entity99 despite the travellers ' complaints			1
mr @entity81 told @entity37 : ' i think it 's going to enhance the site and at the end of the day we 're catering for the gipsy and traveller community			1
' when it comes to brick and mortar houses we have to deliver 6,500 to 7,000 in the next few years			0
' the gipsy community is being treated no differently to any other section of the community			2
' i welcome the planning committee 's decision			0
' previously mr @entity81 had confirmed he was approached by angry residents			2
' they do n't want an expansion on the site , ' he said			2
' they started a petition within their community to prevent the council from going ahead			2
' if you live in a lovely , countryside area , in a close - knit community , would you want strangers coming in ? ' families at the @entity129 camp previously said there was a divide over the council plans between those who had been there for decades and newcomers			0
@entity136 , a long term resident at the site , said : ' it 's not a question of the people , it 's the space			2
' how would these councillors suddenly like a lot of houses built opposite where they live ? nobody wants that			0
' rural location : the site is on the edge of the south @entity10 village of @entity99			1
@entity136 , a long term resident of the site , said previously : ' it 's not a question of the people , it 's the space ... nobody wants that ' but mother - of - seven @entity155 , 30 , originally from @entity156 , welcomed the expansion plans			1
she said : ' i know some people here are against this but they tend to be the older generation			0
' people here with families support the expansion			0
the children would like to see a park built as well			0
' i think more people should be able to come here if they want			0
there are more people for this than against			0
' @entity172 , director of environment at @entity174 , said there was a need for additional pitches up to 2026			0
councillor @entity178 said : ' it is pleasing to see that our council is providing adequate spaces for these communities			0
