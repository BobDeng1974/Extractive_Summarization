lightning strikes in the @entity2 could increase by nearly 50 percent by the end of the century as the world gets warmer and wetter , a new study says			1
while those conditions were already known to promote thunderstorms in general , the new work focused on lightning strikes themselves			1
researchers calculated just how much lightning flashes increase as air warms , clouds fill with more energy from water vapor and rainfall intensifies			1
a monsoon lightning storm strikes over @entity18 , @entity19			2
rising global temperatures may cause a big jolt in the number of lightning strikes in the @entity2 over the rest of the 21st century in the latest example of extreme weather spawned by climate change , scientists say			1
the researchers based their calculation on 2011 weather data from across the @entity2 the key is that warmer air holds more water vapor			1
water vapor is fuel for thunderstorms , sparking more lightning			1
the energy that storms get from vapor is the biggest driver in increasing lightning strikes in the future , the researchers said			1
they concluded that for every degree @entity48 the world warms in the future , lightning strikes will go up nearly 7 percent			1
that 's 12 percent for every degree @entity53			2
because scientists forecast that the world may get about 7 degrees warmer ( 4 degrees @entity53 ) by the end of the century , based on current carbon dioxide emission trends , that comes to a 50 percent increase in lightning strikes , said @entity61			1
he 's the atmospheric scientist at the @entity63 who led the study			0
' when you used to have two lightning strikes , now you 'll have three , ' @entity61 said			2
' it 's a substantial increase			0
' the researchers based their calculation on 2011 weather data from across the @entity2 they presented their results in a paper released thursday by the journal @entity75			0
@entity61 said the key is that warmer air holds more water vapor			1
water vapor is fuel for thunderstorms , sparking more lightning			1
the energy that storms get from vapor is the biggest driver in increasing lightning strikes in the future , @entity61 said			1
the new study shows that at any given level of rainfall intensity , there will be more lightning in the future			2
@entity95 , a @entity96 severe storm meteorologist , said the study makes sense and marks an advance over previous work			0
the result is important mostly because it means more natural sparks for dangerous wildfires , which are already forecast to worsen with man - made warming , @entity61 , @entity95 and other meteorologists said			0
this graphic shows the intensity of lightning flashes averaged over the year in the lower 48 states during 2011			0
lightning strikes north of @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112			2
a new study says flashes of lightning in the @entity2 will likely increase by nearly 50 percent by the end of the century because of global warming			2
lightning deaths have been falling from about 100 per year in the 1960s and 1970s to 33 per year in the last decade			0
so far this year 25 people have been killed , @entity96 data shows			0
@entity95 said the drop is because of people changing their behavior to be safer in storms and better medical treatment of lightning victims			0
the top states for lightning deaths in the past decade are @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			0
about 80 percent of lightning victims are male			0
@entity137 , a @entity139 climate scientist , said this study ' is yet another reminder that there are likely some unwelcome surprises in store ... when it comes to the impacts of climate change			0
