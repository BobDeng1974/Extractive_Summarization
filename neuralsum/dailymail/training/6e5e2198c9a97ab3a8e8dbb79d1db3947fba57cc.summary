for many of us , there 's nothing better at the end of the day than that nice cold lager or soothing glass of wine			1
but would you have that second or third glass if you knew how many calories you were knocking back ? new research has revealed the vast majority of us have no idea - and are unwittingly drinking ourselves fatter in the process			1
in a bid to highlight the fattening effect , the @entity21 has decided to highlight these drink - food equivalents the survey of 2,000 adults was carried out for the @entity27			2
it found that three - quarters of the public did not know - or wrongly guessed - the calories in a large glass of wine			1
nine out of 10 had no idea what a pint of lager contained			1
a pint of @entity40 – 180 calories – small slice of chocolate cake @entity44 ( 250ml ) – 185 calories – 4 fish fingers @entity48 with rum – 644 calories – @entity50 @entity51 – 237 calories – slice of pizza @entity54 – 143 calories – @entity56 this is despite the fact that adults who drink get approximately 10 per cent of their calories from alcohol			1
as a result , two out of three people said they want calorie labels on alcohol			1
alcoholic beverages are currently not recognised as food and are therefore exempted , under existing @entity68 legislation , from normal food labelling			0
around 56 calories are contained in a unit of alcohol , which is a small glass of low - strength wine			1
the recommended daily calorie intake for adults is approximately 2,500 calories for men and 2,000 for women			2
however , as the new report points out , extra calories are n't just consumed at the time of drinking - there 's the effect the day after , too , with ' carb cravings ' and weaker willpower			2
@entity86 , chief executive of the @entity21 , said : ' with 2 in 3 adults overweight or obese and given that adults who drink get approximately 10 per cent of their calories from alcohol , this move could make a major difference to waistlines of the nation			1
’ in a bid to highlight how many calories popular drinks contain , the @entity21 has released a food comparison table			0
it reveals that a pint of lager , which contains an average of 180 calories , is roughly equivalent to a small slice of chocolate cake			1
a large 250ml glass of white wine is the same as four fish fingers , while an alcopop equates to a slice of pizza			2
a pina colada , on the other hand , packs away the same number of calories as a @entity116 the @entity117 gives exercise comparisons , too			0
to burn off two pints of lager would take 30 minutes of running , while two double @entity120 would need an hour of cycling to whittle away			0
two thirds of people polled for the survey agreed they wanted calorie labels on alcohol at the more outrageous end of the scale , one frozen margarita would apparently take more than seven hours of sex to burn off			1
as part of the poll , the @entity21 also conducted an experiment in a pub - to find out if displaying calories on drinks menus changed drinking behaviour			2
over 80 per cent of the public did not know - or incorrectly estimated - the calorie content of a large glass of wine , which is around 160 calories			1
almost 60 per cent did not know - and a further 30 per cent incorrectly estimated - the calories in a pint of lager , which is as much as 180 calories			2
people presented with calorie information consumed on average 400 calories less than those unaware of the calorie content of their drinks , the researchers found			1
the @entity21 is now calling on the drinks industry and newly appointed @entity157 commissioner to introduce calorie labelling for alcoholic drinks			0
the @entity160 says it will make a decision by december on extending nutrition labelling including calories on alcoholic products			0
@entity86 said : ‘ calorie labelling has been successfully introduced for a wide range of food products and there is now a clear public appetite for this information to be extended to alcohol to help individuals make informed choices			0
@entity174 , chief nutritionist at @entity175 , told @entity176 : ' calorie labelling is a great idea and we know it does help some people improve their calorie intake , but for others of us , we do n't notice it , so calorie labelling is one of a number of things that can be helpful			0
' alcohol itself is quite calorific , it is almost as calorific as fat , which people do n't realise			0
' sometimes you think of drinks as not being part of your calorie intake when in fact they are			0
there is n't anything low calorie about alcohol at all			0
' if you think , if you have a couple of glasses of wine with a meal that 's like having an extra course			0

survey found 75 ***%*** have no idea how many calories in a glass of wine
around *90* ***%*** had no idea how many were in a pint of lager
experts warn many of us are unwittingly becoming obese through booze
the average person gets 10 ***%*** of their calories a day through alcohol
two thirds of those polled backed calorie labels on alcohol
