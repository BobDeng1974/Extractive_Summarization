@entity5 dropped more than nine stone by abandoning comfort eating and taking up regular exercise , after realising that her weight problem could endanger her nine - month - old son @entity10			1
she said : ‘ @entity10 loved crawling everywhere and trying to clamber up onto our sofa - i remember watching him as he kept falling onto his bottom , in the way that babies do			1
@entity5 dropped 10 dress sizes and 9st 4lbs in 18 months after changing her diet and taking up exercise @entity5 with her sons @entity20 , right , and @entity10 , left who inspired her weight loss ‘ i was so overweight that i was n’t very mobile or steady on my feet			1
as he kept falling down , i had a terrible vision in my head			2
i imagined how terrible it would be if i fell over and squashed @entity10 by accident			2
‘ i realised that i ’d barely be able to lift myself off the floor , let alone help him			2
i decided to do something about my weight problem once and for all			2
’ by the time of her revelation ms @entity36 , 33 , had been struggling with anxiety caused by poor self - esteem for years			1
she began piling on the pounds 12 years ago , shortly after meeting the father of her two sons @entity10 , now eight , and @entity20 , six			1
she said : ‘ life was comfortable			0
i stopped going out and preferred to stay in with takeaways			0
i did n’t look after myself at all			0
after her son @entity20 ( pictured ) was born , she began a simple exercise regime in her living room and , as her health slowly improved , she found it easier to venture outside @entity5 's new - found confidence inspired her to start a personal training business and she hopes to soon qualify as an occupational therapist ‘ after @entity10 was born i fell into a cycle where i was n’t happy about the way i looked , so i ate more to distract myself from how i was feeling			1
‘ ready meals were my weakness			1
the only problem i had with them was that if anything they took too long to cook			0
i was always looking for quick , instant lifts for my mood			0
’ at her heaviest ms @entity36 weighed 19st 11lb and wore size 26 clothes			1
‘ i became very anxious and paranoid			0
i remember going to my local shop , buying a sandwich and eating it on the street without waiting to get home			0
i imagined passers - by were thinking , ‘ look at that fat person , no wonder she ’s so fat if she eats like that ’			2
‘ as i became more afraid of other people , i could n’t face leaving the house			0
i became a prisoner in my own home			0
’ as well as exercise @entity5 began dieting , swapping ready - meals and takeaways for reduced - calorie options and fruit juice it was then that @entity10 ’s innocent play inspired his mother to turn her life around			1
ms @entity36 , of @entity86 , said : ‘ i thought , ‘ even if i do n’t fall on him , if he falls and bumps himself , would i be able to get over to him in time to look after him ? ’ @entity5 has now reached her target weight of 10st 7lb and she is a healthy size 12 ‘ i could n’t even get up from the sofa without rolling onto my side and heaving myself up			1
’ she began dieting , swapping ready - meals and takeaways for reduced - calorie options and fruit juice			1
after her son @entity20 was born , she began a simple exercise regime in her living room and as her health slowly improved , she found it easier to venture outside			1
she said : ‘ i began by going into the garden , and then into the street outside , and eventually i could manage to go all the way into town without having a panic attack			2
’ but as the weight fell off , ms @entity36 found she had become psychologically dependent on dieting and exercise			2
in 2009 , 18 months after her weight - loss programme began , she could fit into size six clothing			1
she said : ‘ i know i went too far the other way and became obsessive about losing weight			0
my friends and family were worried i was getting too skinny			0
i felt as if i was constantly battling against myself			0
‘ it was only after i organised my exercise properly and figured out a diet tailored just for me that i was able to find the right balance			0
eventually i was able to sustain a sensible weight			0
’ last year ms @entity36 had reached her target weight of 10st 7lb and she is now a healthy size 12			1
her new - found confidence inspired her to start a personal training business and she hopes to soon qualify as an occupational therapist			1
she said : ‘ i get a huge kick out of making people ’s lives healthier and happier			0
‘ people find themselves in unhealthy situations they feel they ca n’t get out of - i know i did			2
if i can do anything to help them feel less trapped , then i think that ’s wonderful			0
