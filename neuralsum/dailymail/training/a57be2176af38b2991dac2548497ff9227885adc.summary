by @entity1 reporter when money in their current account and savings is added to the value of their homes , car and belongings , the average @entity2 is worth nearly £ 150,000 the average @entity2 is worth nearly £ 150,000 , according to a study			1
this includes an average current pension pot of £ 30,000 and mortgage equity of £ 75,000			1
yet the survey found nearly half of us have no idea how much we are worth , while 42 per cent do not think they are worth very much at all			1
however , the average adult has £ 1,348.16 in a current account , £ 5,603.98 stored away in a savings account and a further £ 3,712.65 in an @entity24 with a car valued at £ 6,706.55 and home contents worth £ 15,077.90 , average net worth tots up to £ 147,134			1
the survey of 2,000 adults by solicitors @entity28 also found that despite substantial assets , six in ten adults do not have a will , while a third have no plans to make one			2
@entity38 , a wills expert at the law firm , said : ' many @entity41 adults feel they have very few assets to their name and consequently is it not worth them making a will			1
' but the reality is very different in that most people will have assets tied up in investments they would n't even think would count			1
' so while the average @entity41 adult does n't have millions tucked away , they should still make sensible provisions and arrangements for their future			2
' around half the people surveyed do n't know how assets are distributed after death , while 54 per cent are clueless about what accounts and investments their partner or family has			1
despite their increasing wealth , six in ten adults do not have a will and a third have no plans to make one ms @entity38 added : ' planning for the future is vital			0
many people are attempting to save money by not making wills and then when the inevitable happens , they do it themselves in relation to the estate administration			0
' what they find is that this is a specialist area of law and there are potentially serious pitfalls			0
' while some may feel they can save money by avoiding legal advice , our experience is that such an outlook can create a false economy			0
' this is because ultimately , if they do go it alone and subsequently hit problems , then it can be more expensive to sort out the situation in the long run			0
' common issues from failing to take advice include incorrectly distributing the estate and a lack of awareness of the tax issues which surround administering an estate - this can lead to missed tax deadlines and potential penalty charges			0
' also , with specialist advice , they may be able to look at ways to reduce the burden of inheritance tax to the benefit of families and charities			0
' finally , without the relevant experience , people may often be unable to properly and thoroughly assess all of the assets and debts of the deceased - an issue in itself which makes it more likely that distribution of the estate will not be undertaken correctly			2
' the consequences of getting such issues wrong can be serious and @entity118 representatives are personally and financially liable for any mistakes they make			0

average @entity2 has £ 30,000 pension pot and £ 75,000 mortgage equity
