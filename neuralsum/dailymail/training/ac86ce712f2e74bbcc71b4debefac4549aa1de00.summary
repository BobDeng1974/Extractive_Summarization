and animal rights enthusiasts may wish to look away			0
designed to resemble the 80 - year - old designer 's signature monochrome uniform , the @entity4 's ' sunglasses ' are black mink , his ' torso ' is silver fox , and there 's a tuft of goat fur sprouting from his ' head ' for good measure			1

miss @entity14 , a firm favorite of mr @entity1 , has had a long - standing affection for trinkets that resemble the iconic designer			0
before the @entity4 came into existence , she was regularly spotted carrying round a knitted doll version , which retailed for a much more modest $ 134			2
spitting image : the @entity4 ( left ) is crafted from mink , fox , and goat fur , and first made its runway debut at @entity3 's fall show in @entity11 this february , in an ode to mr @entity1 ( right ) @entity47 galore : the famously outspoken designer has been @entity3 's designer of fur since 1965 , and once described ethical conversations on the matter as ' childish ' during an interview with @entity53 two years ago , miss @entity14 yanked the knitted doll out of her handbag and said : ' this is what i keep with me every day			1
' you can change him , i 've got different outfits for him			0
@entity1 told me i need to change his outfit every day			0
' she added that she sometimes braids the doll 's wool hair			0
mr @entity1 , has been @entity3 's designer of fur and ready - to - wear since 1965			1
famous for his blunt approach and acid tongue - he 's called @entity72 ugly , @entity69 fat , and @entity73 fake - he once said of the animals who end up on his runways that he is simply ' killing those beasts who would kill us if they could ' and that ' the discussion of fur is childish			2
' likeness : before the @entity4 , miss @entity14 carried this knitted doll ( pictured ) in her handbag with her ' every day , ' even changing its outfits and braiding its hair designer @entity86 , who never uses fur or leather in her collections , once sent mr @entity1 an anti-fur video , later telling animal rights charity @entity91 that he ' did n't have the balls ' to watch it , and had ' rather predictably felt the need to return it			2
' @entity91 spoke to @entity94 about the @entity4 , stating : ' either @entity1 is losing his marbles and has forgotten that not so long ago , he was sensibly praising faux fur as a substitute - or his innovative years are behind him			2
' there 's nothing new or exciting about draping models in the skins of dead animals			0
' there is at least one fluffy animal who makes it into mr @entity1 's work without first being dead , however , and that 's his beloved @entity110 cat , @entity111			0
this week , it was revealed that the blue - eyed , white - furred feline will be fronting a new make - up campaign mr @entity1 is heading up with @entity117 cosmetics brand @entity115 later this year .			0
