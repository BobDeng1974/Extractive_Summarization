by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor first minister @entity2 claims @entity3 will be richer after independence after independence @entity3 will either be £ 1,400 a year out of pocket or £ 950 better off , according to rival reports published this morning			1
treasury secretary @entity8 claimed @entity3 voters would be throwing away a ' @entity11 dividend ' of £ 25 a week if they voted @entity12 to independence in september			1
he spoke out as the @entity14 published a new report on @entity3 's finances in the 20 years after independence			2
mr @entity8 argued that leaving the @entity11 would mean lower tax revenues north of the border and increased public spending , leaving @entity3 £ 1,400 a year worse off			2
the @entity11 government minister said a separate @entity3 could face higher interest payments on @entity24 debts , at the same time as it had to deal with falling oil revenues and an ageing population			0
speaking on a visit to @entity29 , mr @entity8 said : ' because as a @entity11 we can pool resources and share risks , it means a @entity11 dividend of £ 1,400 a year for every man , woman and child in @entity3			2
' that dividend is our share of a more prosperous future			0
it is the money that will pay for better public services and a fairer society			0
' but @entity3 first minister @entity2 said @entity3 could be £ 5billion a year better off in 15 years ' time without having to raise taxes if it became independent - amounting to just under £ 100 a year for each @entity47			1
he said an increase of 0.3 percentage points in the long run productivity growth rate could raise an additional £ 2.4 billion a year in revenues by 2029/30			0
meanwhile , upping the number of people in work by 3.3 per cent could provide additional revenues of £ 1.3 billion a year , according to a paper released by the @entity24			0
a rise in the population , which is less than the @entity11 as a whole is expected to see , could net a further £ 1.5 billion a year by 2029/30 , it argues			1
@entity62 treasury secretary @entity8 has claimed @entity3 will be £ 1,400 a year worse off if they vote to leave the @entity11 mr @entity2 said the outlook for @entity3 's @entity63 ' gives a very clear picture of what independence could deliver in economic terms for the people of @entity3 '			1
but mr @entity8 said some of the claims the @entity71 were making were ' utterly preposterous ' he pointed to @entity14 analysis which said there would be a £ 2.7 billion cost for setting up a new @entity3 state - which was based on a £ 15 million estimated cost for setting up each of 180 policy departments			1
however professor @entity79 , whose work was used as the basis of the report , said ' the @entity14 has badly misrepresented the research of the @entity84 '			0
mr @entity2 said the @entity14 had been ' caught red - handed trying to cook the books '			2
he said : ' this leaves the @entity14 claims about @entity3 's finances without a shred of credibility			2
' @entity3 's finance secretary @entity91 added : ' the @entity92 has been caught fiddling the books as they have tried to undermine confidence in @entity3 about the steps that we can take towards independence			0
' he said : ' @entity3 will start life as an independent nation with access to our own wealth and a key stake in the £ 1.3 trillion of assets built up by the @entity11 and funded by @entity3 taxpayers			2
' mr @entity91 added : ' in the case of physical assets overseas or defence assets that can not be transferred or shared with @entity3 , then the result will be for @entity3 to receive a cash share of their value or to see our share of @entity11 debts reduced			0
' the @entity11 @entity24 is very keen to talk about the debt we have built up or to invent costs , but rarely talks about the assets that have been accumulated and for which @entity3 has paid			0
' former chancellor @entity122 is leading the ' better together ' campaign against independence , but has been criticised for his lackluster campaign but mr @entity8 insisted that prof @entity79 's work ' does n't form part of the building blocks of the analysis we are publishing today '			0
this research estimated it could cost up to on per cent of a country 's economy to establish a new state - which in @entity3 's case would be £ 1.5 billion			1
mr @entity8 said : ' £ 1.5 billion is the figure we use in our analysis today , but it 's dwarfed by the massive deficit , the extra deficit , that an independent @entity3 would have			1
' mr @entity91 added on @entity140 's today programme that analysis showed an independent @entity3 would have been £ 8.3 billion better off compared to the rest of the @entity11 over the last five years			1
the @entity62 minister said @entity3 would be starting off with a deficit about twice the size of the rest of the @entity11 , which would necessitate higher taxes or substantial spending cuts			0
mr @entity8 stood by the @entity14 analysis in relation to prof @entity79 's figures and pointed out that a leaked memo of mr @entity91 's previously suggested that setting up the tax system alone would cost £ 600 million .			1

@entity14 says independent @entity3 will be billions of pounds a year poorer
report claims setting up new state will cost £ 1.5 billion alone
but @entity2 releases rival report *rubbishing* @entity162 claims
first minister argues @entity3 will be £ 25 a week better off after independence
