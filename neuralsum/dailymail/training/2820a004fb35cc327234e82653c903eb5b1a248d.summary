by @entity0 a judge has ruled that @entity2 can be visited by his relatives without an @entity5 agent present			1
the @entity6 had previously been watched during the visits , but his defense attorneys argued that there was no clear threat and the agent 's presence prevented the family from speaking freely			1
' this case is very much a story about a family and the relationships between them , ' defense attorney @entity14 said in a court hearing on wednesday			2
' i donâ € ™ t think the safety , security issue looms very large , ' @entity38 district judge @entity37 ruled			0
the @entity43 reported that the decision will not be final until the @entity45 weighs in , and that is expected to take about two weeks			0
the agent 's presence is not only a question of security but could also have a role in the trial as it was earlier reported that during one of these visits , the agent allegedly heard @entity54 say something controversial in a heated exchange with his sister			0
' @entity2 , despite the presence of an @entity5 agent and an employee of the federal public defender , was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent , ' a late february court hearing stated			0
under a spell : the denfense s planning on describing how @entity2 was under his brother 's control when he participated in the dual bombing at the @entity6 in 2013 ( pictured : then - 19 - year - old @entity2 being captured ) prosecutors later said that the remark was ' the driving force ' behind @entity2 's defense team 's decision to push for a change in the visitation procedure			1
the strategy also suggests that the defense team is preparing to paint @entity2 , who was 19 at the time of last year 's bombings , as under the mental control of his 26 - year - old brother @entity29 who was killed in a shoot out with police			1
on wednesday , the prosecutors also said that @entity2 's defense team will not have access to the growing file on a triple homicide in @entity94 , @entity95 in 2011 that @entity29 was apparently involved in			2
police were looking into the connection and interviewing a friend of @entity29 's named @entity99 in @entity100 when @entity99 attacked the investigating agents and was shot dead			0
paying respects : the court decisions come just one day after the anniversary of the bombings ( the @entity107 finish line pictured on tuesday during a memorial ceremony ) the prosecution in @entity2 's case admitted that it does not appear that the suspect had any knowledge of his brother 's involvement in the 2011 case so there is no reason to connect it to the @entity6 case			1
they also said that by releasing the case file on the 2011 triple slaying could be potentially detrimental to the renewed investigation into that case			0
this is an important week in the case , if not necessarily for the ongoing federal trial process but because tuesday marked the one - year anniversary of the double bombing at the finish line that left three spectators dead and more than more than 260 injured .			2

@entity2 previously had to be *supervised* during his visits with his sisters but a judge ruled that he should be allowed *privacy*
@entity137 wanted to use something @entity2 said during one of those visits in the case against him since it was ' detrimental '
his defense attorneys argued that they need to understand the family 's *dynamics* , which they say can only *happen* when they speak freely
ruling comes the day after the one year anniversary of the bombings
