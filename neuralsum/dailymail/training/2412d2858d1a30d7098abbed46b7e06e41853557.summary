by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:56 est , 9 december 2013 a mother has told how her three - year - old son has been given only a 50 per cent chance of survival just weeks after doctors first diagnosed him with constipation			1
@entity9 was in tears with constant stomach pains and sickness , but despite several visits to the doctors , his mother was told there was nothing seriously wrong with him			1
but after a week of sleepless nights , his mother @entity18 , 21 , begged a paediatrician to check her son again			1
@entity9 , three , was taken to the doctor by his mother , @entity23 , 21 , when he developed stomach pains and sickness			1
ms @entity18 was told he was constipated and was sent away with medication he found @entity9 had an enlarged liver and a rapid heartbeat and advised him to be rushed to hospital			1
after a series of scans and checks , it was discovered @entity9 had a rare condition called dilated cardiomyopathy and his heart was operating at just five per cent capacity - barely keeping him alive			1
as a result , he will now need a risky heart transplant			2
ms @entity18 said : ‘ he ’s the only kid in @entity41 to have the condition , as it normally only affects adults , but i will be complaining about the doctors			2
‘ they basically left me at home for a week with him fighting for his life and it ’s just not good enough			0
‘ we ’re now waiting for a heart donor to be found , but they ’re saying it is 50/50 whether he ’ll survive the operation or not - it ’s horrible			2
when @entity9 's condition did not improve , ms @entity18 ( pictured ) begged a paediatrician to check him over again and he was found to have an enlarged liver and an excessively fast heart beat ‘ @entity9 ’s condition means only five per cent of his heart is actually working - it is basically just keeping him alive and no more			1
’ dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition which causes the heart muscle to become stretched and thin meaning it can not can not pump blood around the body effectively			1
ms @entity18 , from @entity68 , says the news knocked her for six and admitted she could n’t have kept herself together if it was n’t for the support of her mother , @entity72 , 42			1
she said : ‘ my mum has been such a great help to me			0
she was just as worried about @entity9 when he had a sore tummy and was being sick			0
‘ we were both convinced there was something wrong with him , so i took him to a doctor , but he said “ no that ’s just constipation ” and we were told to go home			0
@entity9 ( pictured in hospital ) was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy , a condition which means the heart muscle becomes stretched and thin preventing it from beating effectively ‘ @entity9 got worse and i tried to get a doctor to see him a number of times for a whole week , but they said just to keep on giving him the medication they had given me			1
‘ eventually i said “ i ’ve had enough of this ” and demanded to see a doctor again			0
‘ a paediatrician came around and found that @entity9 ’s heart was beating a too fast and his liver was enlarged , so he got us into hospital straight away			1
’ after being admitted to @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , @entity9 was given echocardiography and an ultrasound			0
he was then diagnosed with stage two dilated cardiomyopathy and flown by air ambulance to the intensive care unit at @entity108 ’s @entity107			2
@entity9 is now waiting for a heart transplant but his mother has been told there is only a 50 per cent chance of him surviving the operation @entity9 spent eight days in the @entity107 in @entity108 in the intensive care unit and high dependency unit before being driven back to @entity100 in an ambulance for another three nights			1
ms @entity18 said : ‘ the doctor at @entity100 explained @entity9 ’s condition had deteriorated to stage three by then			1
‘ he then told me that he would need a heart transplant , which will be carried out at a hospital in @entity122			2
‘ when i found out that he needed a heart transplant i just kept thinking he was going to die			2
‘ the doctor sat me down to tell me and i just started screaming and crying			0
’ ms @entity18 now faces an agonising wait as a heart donor for @entity9 is tracked down , but she is worried the operation wo n’t come quick enough as her son battles for survival			1
ms @entity18 said : ' when i found out that he needed a heart transplant i just kept thinking he was going to die			1
the doctor sat me down to tell me and i just started screaming and crying ' she said : ‘ the operation could be any time from now until the @entity135			0
‘ he ’ll be going down to @entity122 soon for a couple of days to have tests done , but we have no word on the op yet			0
‘ i ’ve been told there ’s a chance his body could reject the heart , but the main concern at the moment is getting him fit enough for the operation as the medication he ’s been taking is making him sick and they could n’t operate on him at the moment anyway because he ’s too thin			2
‘ i just want to appeal to people and highlight how important organ donation is			0
‘ i want everyone to go and sign up because it could save a life			0
’ a spokesman for @entity163 said a complaint about @entity166 's treatment had not been received and that he would encourage his mother to register her concerns through the complaint system			0
to find out more about organ donation visit @entity171 dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle which causes it to become stretched and thin			1
this means it is unable to pump blood around the body effectively			0
the condition can be inherited but it can also be caused by viral infections , uncontrolled high blood pressure , problems with the heart valves , excessive alcohol consumption and pregnancy			0
the disease can cause fluid to build up in the lungs , ankles , abdomen and other organs - this collection of symptoms is known as heart failure			0
the most common symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy are shortness of breath , swelling of the ankle and abdomen , excessive tiredness and palpitations			2
there is no cure for the condition but treatment can be used to control the symptoms and to prevent complications			0
treatment options include medicine to control the heart rhythm , a pacemaker and an @entity212 - an implant which gives the heart an electric shock if it slips out of a normal rhythm			0
