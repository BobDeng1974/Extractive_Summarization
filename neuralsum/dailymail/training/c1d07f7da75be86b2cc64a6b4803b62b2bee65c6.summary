it was the middle of the night and nobody else was there ; i thought they were going to make me disappear , ' he said			2
' they forced me to smash the sculpture with a hammer and filmed me doing it			1
there was at least 20 of them , so i could hardly say no. ' @entity0 says ' @entity14 ' represents the rapid urbanisation of @entity1 , a process which frequently sees cultural landmarks demolished			1

@entity1 - born @entity9 artist @entity0 is greeted by friends as he arrives at @entity64 in june , after being exiled for five years from @entity1 @entity0 is adamant that it was the international coverage of ' @entity14 ' that sparked his exile from @entity1 , while the @entity1 government claims it was due to ' visa irregularities ' @entity7 was the site of a notorious massacre @entity0 himself witnessed in 1989 , which saw the @entity1 military open fire on thousands of pro-democracy protesters , killing an undisclosed number			1
@entity0 's arrest came days before the 25th anniversary of the event , a time when the @entity1 government was arresting scores of activists and artists in what could be viewed as a crackdown on dissent			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity85 told @entity86 had been deported , ' reportedly due to visa irregularities '			1
but @entity0 is adamant his visa was legitimate , and instead insisted that it was the international coverage of the artwork by news services such as the @entity91 and the @entity92 that sparked the ordeal			1
' i think ' @entity14 ' was the last straw			2
even though it never left my studio , the government had been watching me for a long time , even in @entity9 , ' he said			2
' when the artwork gained exposure they decided to draw the line			2
' @entity0 says he has no regrets about the artwork , despite being separated from his family over the ordeal @entity0 says he has been blacklisted by the government and would be harshly monitored by government officials if he ever returns when he arrived at prison , @entity0 says he was interrogated for five hours before being taken into a squalid cell			1
' there was one toilet between fifteen men , and the bedding they gave me probably had n't been washed in years , ' he said			0
but he says the worst of the experience was psychological			0
' the worst of it was the mind games			0
they threaten you and film you all the time to make you paranoid			0
they never beat me , but they did ( beat ) some inmates			0
' @entity0 spent his two weeks in jail speaking to other prisoners and learning their stories			2
when the short sentence was up , he was whisked to the airport and told he could not return for at least five years			0
' at first i was annoyed because they lied until the last minute			0
i have been dislodged from my family			0
but when i look at what is going on with the @entity1 government cracking down on artists and activists , i feel like it would be too dangerous for me to return now			1
' @entity0 says he has been blacklisted and would be harshly monitored by government officials if he ever returned			1
however he told @entity139 he has no regrets about making ' @entity141			0
' ' this make me feel more strong and it gives me the strength to do my art , and also i feel that i should keep going , to make people to know i 'm still standing , even after these things happen to me , nothing can really knock me down			0
