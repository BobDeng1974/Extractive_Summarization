for instance , consumers who can no longer shop for themselves , complete housework , or drive their cars are considered ‘ old , ’ the study claims			1
@entity18 is an important marker of age and strongly related to a person 's ' ability to drive , shop , and cook for themselves ' according to the new study by @entity30 researcher @entity29 , activities that define one ’s independence are the most important markers of age			1
in much of @entity1 , a person ’s independence is closely tied to their ability to drive , shop , and cook for themselves			2
because of these unwritten adages , those who are too feeble to carry shopping bags or operate their vehicle are looked at as someone in their twilight years			0
to conduct her research , ms @entity29 conducted in - depth interviews with consumers in their late 80s , as well as their caregivers and family members – often the subject ’s adult children in their 50s and 60s			1
her new study looks into how perceptions of aging are changing she found that the @entity59 , who are aging themselves , did not wish to be seen as old , but often treated their own parents as ‘ old people ’ – not allowing them to exercise independence where they could and assuming they ’re scatterbrained as well as slow			1
because of this , she writes that conflicts are ripe to occur between the parents , who do n’t see themselves as old , and their adult children , who do			2
ms @entity29 notes that those in their 80s and 90s are often dealing with negative connotations of old age			2
‘ almost every stereotype we associate with being elderly is something negative , ’ she said , ‘ from being “ crotchety ” and unwilling to change to being forgetful			0
’ one woman she interviewed , ‘ @entity77 , ’ is 89			0
when her adult daughters drove her to a routine doctor ’s appointment and accompanied her into the exam room , the doctor addressed her daughters and would n’t talk to @entity77			0
ms @entity29 claims that society tends to marginalize those who are advanced in years , rather than valuing them for their wisdom at later appointments , @entity77 told her daughters to remain in the waiting room while she was meeting with her physician			0
ms @entity29 writes that part of the problem with ‘ old age ’ is that society tends to marginalize those who are advanced in years , rather than valuing them for their wisdom			1
‘ unless we change the way we view old age , the generation younger than the boomers will treat them the same way as soon as they show a few more wrinkles , or seem a bit shaky on their feet , ’ she said			0
her full study will be published in the april 2013 edition of the @entity110 .			0

study from @entity30 says that once an ‘ elderly ’ person can not shop or drive for themselves , they are considered to be in ‘ old age ’
also looks at how those who have reached ‘ old age ’ are marginalized by society
study looked at people in their 80s and 90s and found that even their adult children treated them *differently* because of their advanced age
