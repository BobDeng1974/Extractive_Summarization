@entity0 picked up seven birdies and two eagles to storm to the top of the leaderboard on the first day of @entity6 ' @entity5 in @entity7			1
but the @entity8 , who put the distress caused by his publicised break - up with tennis player @entity12 to one side last weekend to win the @entity14 on sunday , might have been five strokes clear of the field had he not spoiled his remarkable run over the back nine with a double bogey on the par - four 14th hole			2
@entity0 hits from a bunker on the 14th hole during the first round in @entity23 , @entity7 he rallied to card an impressive nine - under 63 , while @entity30 's @entity29 shot a six - under 66 earlier on thursday to take a share of second place with @entity27 @entity26 and @entity28			1
it was the lowest opening round in 39 years at the @entity32			1
' i do n't think it 's anything more than just being confident with my game , ' @entity0 said			2
' i was expecting this to happen			0
i 've been playing well			0
i 've been posting good numbers , good rounds			0
and i knew my game was close			0
and honestly , i do n't think it 's anything to do with what 's happening off the golf course			0
it 's just i 've been trending in the right direction , and it 's starting to all come together			0
' injury scare : @entity0 tweaked his knee hitting an approach to the seventh in the swing : @entity0 hits his second shot on the fifth hole at @entity51 his only scare came on the seventh hole when his spikes caught and applied a little more torque on his knee			1
@entity0 said he had never experienced that before , but he thought some ice and work in the fitness trailer should take care of it			2
' the inside of it is sore , a little swollen , ' @entity0 said			2
' some treatment and i should be fine for the morning			0
' @entity0 clinched a surprise victory at @entity66 and that winning momentum followed him to @entity51			0
birdies on the second , fourth and seventh holes followed a run of two birdies and an eagle over the turn before he picked up a sixth shot on 13			1
focus : @entity0 has put the distress of his break - up with @entity78 to one side at eight under he was two strokes clear of the three men who had already carded 66 , but briefly joined @entity29 and the @entity27 duo in a tie for the lead after finding the rear bunker on 14 and needing a total of six shots to hole out			1
@entity0 remedied that situation immediately by draining a 15 - foot putt to claim his second eagle of the day before adding one final birdie on the 16th			2
@entity29 , currently 97th in the official world rankings , started with a bogey but reached the turn four under having drained an eagle on the par - five seventh			1
he mixed three more birdies with a bogey between 14 and 17 while @entity28 's seven birdies and a bogey kept him in sight of the lead			1
picturesque : @entity0 walks over a bridge on the third hole at the @entity5 @entity107 : @entity0 escapes from a trap during his brilliant round at @entity6 's tournament reigning @entity111 champion @entity26 might well have finished on eight under but dropped shots on 16 and 17			1
completing the formative top 10 are @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
most notable in the group of @entity27 was @entity114 , who registered a bogey - free five - under 67 - recording only 27 putts - after making the switch from his favoured anchored putter to a non-anchored flatstick			0
there were modest performances from 20 - year - old hopeful @entity127 , who signed for 69 after mixing five birdies with two bogeys , and @entity130			0
the @entity132 's run of five birdies and a bogey across seven holes on the front nine was sullied by a double bogey on the ninth and , like @entity127 , he lies six strokes off the early pace set by @entity0 .			1

@entity0 picked up seven birdies and two eagles in his opening round
@entity0 's only scare came on the seventh hole when he tweaked his knee
he holds a three - shot lead over @entity29 , @entity26 and @entity28
