the podium girl is the centre of a ' sexism storm ' after @entity3 sprayed champagne in her face said she was n't offended by his stunt - and was just doing her job			1
the @entity10 @entity9 racer drew criticism from around the world when he aimed the fizz directly as the face of 23 - year - old grid girl @entity15 , who was pictured looking less than impressed			1
but the @entity17 graduate , who was a ' podium girl ' at the @entity19			1
said she did n't think much about the incident and was n't annoyed			2
' i think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic compared to local media			2
' i was just told by my employer to stand on the podium , and that ’s what i did			2
' miss @entity15 had asked to work as a podium model on the stage of the @entity19 in @entity45 because she was a fan of @entity47 driver @entity46			1
after the incident on sunday object , a campaign group against sexism , condemned the behaviour of the driver as ' selfish and inconsiderate ' and called on @entity3 to apologise to the graduate			1
others have called the driving ace an ' embarrassment to the @entity10 ' , while another said his actions showed that he was an ' ignorant clown '			0
she said : ' the photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed , but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face , which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part			2
' if this if the case we think @entity3 should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future			1
for most people , it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it			0
' it is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it			0
that is something of which he should be aware			0
but instead , he appears to have abused her position			0
' it 's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour			1
' ms @entity69 added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world			0
she said : ' motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves			0
we would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women			0
on @entity114 , @entity3 was described as a ' bully ' and ' disgusting '			1
another user simply said : ' man please stop spraying @entity117 on the @entity118			0
they do n't like it ' , while one outraged user said he was a ' scumbag - an embarrassment to @entity10 '			2
another wrote : ' have a bit more respect for the ladies please			0
spraying @entity117 in her face was out of order # child # idiot			0
' and one tweeted : ' shame on you @entity9 and @entity3 for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration # sexism			1
' it is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move			0
he celebrated in a similar fashion after winning @entity64 @entity19 last year , which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on @entity148 table			1
and although he lost the @entity65 @entity19 to teammate @entity149 , he did n't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess			1
the 30 - year - old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on @entity155 's talk show in 2013			2
@entity3 also sprayed a hostess at @entity157 after winning the @entity64 @entity19 at @entity158 but not everyone was offended by his behaviour			1
many found his actions amusing , while another said : ' i can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @ @entity169			2
. lighten up people ! ' @entity3 controlled the contest in @entity45 to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the @entity9 yesterday			1
but it was n't all smiles at yesterday 's race after a serious feud was sparked between @entity3 and his teammate @entity149 , following a press conference			1
his @entity183 partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from @entity187 's @entity186			0
with the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit - stops , @entity149 reported on the radio that ‘ @entity3 is driving very slowly			1
tell him to speed up			0
’ @entity3 , seemingly protecting his tyres , was given the hurry - up by @entity183 and both he and @entity149 eventually emerged from their final pit - stop first and second with @entity186 third			1
the world champion , sitting beside his teammate , told the press conference yesterday : ' i was n't controlling his race , i was controlling my own race			2
' my goal was to look after my car			0
i had no real threat from @entity149 throughout the whole race			0
' it was n't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between @entity3 and his teammate @entity149 the @entity183 driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning on sunday a visibly angry @entity149 replied : ' it 's just now interesting to hear from you @entity3 that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race			1
' driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant @entity186 was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for @entity186 to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then i had to cover him			0
' it was unnecessarily close with @entity186 as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time because i had to cover him			0
then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer , so i 'm unhappy about that			0
' the spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out - manoeuvre , and at times out - pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded			0
it culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the @entity246 @entity19 , resulting in @entity149 being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team			1
this proved to be a turning point in the championship as @entity3 went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown			1

@entity3 showered her with champagne after winning @entity19
campaigners against sexism said action was ' selfish and inconsiderate '
but @entity15 says she was n't offended and just doing her job
