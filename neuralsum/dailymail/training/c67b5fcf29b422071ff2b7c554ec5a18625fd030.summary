many @entity8 worldwide have expressed pride in seeing @entity1 stirring hopes of progress in communist @entity14 , but some @entity14 - @entity15 say their spiritual leader betrayed them			1
' i 'm still catholic till the day i die , ' said @entity18 , a 53 - year - old maintenance man in @entity19 who was a political prisoner in @entity14 for 16 years			1

' many @entity8 have expressed pride in seeing @entity1 stirring hopes of progress in communist @entity14 , but some @entity14 - @entity15 say their spiritual leader betrayed them @entity18 said he cried when @entity3 surprisingly announced a reversal of a half - century 's efforts to isolate @entity14			1
then , when he learned of @entity1 ' role , he got angry			0
@entity19 archbishop @entity27 acknowledged that some @entity8 are " concerned or suspicious , " but said many more exiles welcome the breakthrough , despite their suffering			1
' the pain is real , but you ca n't build a future on top of resentments , ' @entity27 told @entity36 in an interview			0
the @entity38 has been reaching out to @entity14 at least since @entity39 , who declared during his historic 1998 visit to the island , ' may @entity14 , with all its magnificent potential , open itself up to the world , and may the world open itself up to @entity14			1
" discussions continued under pope @entity47 , who visited @entity14 in 2012			2

@entity54 talks to a reporter at @entity56 in @entity19 about how many @entity8 have expressed pride in seeing @entity1 stirring hopes of progress in communist @entity14 , but some @entity14 - @entity15 say their spiritual leader betrayed them @entity61 cardinal @entity61 , who is close to @entity1 , set up the papal visits and has been decisive in improving ties between the church and the officially atheist state since becoming @entity67 archbishop in 1981			1
this frustrates some older catholics who wanted the church to use its unique position inside @entity14 to take a harder line			2
' the church is contaminated , ' said @entity74 , a 57 - year - old @entity19 mechanic who leads an @entity76 group and wears a gold cross as a sign of his catholic faith			2
exiles incensed by the diplomacy openly wonder : was @entity1 strong - armed by president @entity3 ? does he understand how terrible the @entity4 brothers are ? was he perhaps making a foolhardy bid to cement his change - making image ? ' i do n't know what the pope was thinking , ' said @entity88 , a 53 - year - old lawyer who said he was persecuted for his faith until leaving @entity14 as a teenager , and will never forget watching the government seize a convent near his childhood home			1

anti-castro protester @entity96 holds a a sign in the @entity67 area of @entity19 sen. @entity99 , a @entity100 from @entity7 who has led the @entity103 ' criticism of @entity3 's executive actions on @entity14 , also took a swipe at the pope , telling reporters in @entity108 that he would ' ask his holiness to take up the cause of freedom and democracy			1
' all this is familiar territory for @entity1 , who has spent a lifetime navigating the after - effects of the @entity116 in @entity48			2
in his writings before becoming pope , the @entity118 church leader criticized @entity14 state authoritarianism as well as the @entity15 embargo , and called on both sides to talk out their differences			1
as pope , he wrote to both @entity3 and @entity4 suggesting that a thaw could begin by releasing prisoners			2
but @entity128 , a 50 - year - old @entity19 waiter who was a political prisoner in @entity14 for 27 years , said @entity1 is reaching for more headlines after insisting that homosexuals and divorced people are welcome in church			1
' he 's trying to get a legacy at any price , ' @entity128 said			0
the @entity8 remains the dominant religious force in @entity14 , though attendance at @entity138 is low after decades of official atheism			2
it has long provided an alternative power center where at least some criticism of the government was possible			0
its mediation role could be seen as a reason to trust the promises of change that both @entity3 and @entity4 made this week , but many remain wary			0
@entity96 , a retiree who left @entity14 in 1961 , said @entity1 acted like a beggar , taking whatever scraps of concessions the @entity14 government offered			2
anti-castro protesters and former @entity14 political prisoners @entity18 , left , and @entity128 , right , expressed their disagreement on wednesday 's announcement that the @entity15 and @entity14 will begin taking steps to restore full diplomatic relations ' he wants to be everywhere , he wants to be liked by everyone , ' @entity96 said			2
' that 's his job to be a peace guy , but it does n't accomplish a damn thing , especially in @entity14			0
' @entity15 bishops also have long called for an end to the embargo and for improved relations with @entity14			1
engagement can do more than isolation to open up @entity14 society and improve human rights and religious liberty , they said			0
that message seemed to connect with some attending midday @entity138 at @entity174 , a church dedicated to @entity14 's patron saint			0
' this is the best thing that could have happened , ' said @entity179 , 70 , who left @entity14 during the 1980 @entity180 , when 125,000 fled the island			0
she smiled widely , saying ' everything will be fixed			0
' draped in the bright purple vestments of @entity184 , the rev. @entity185 , who arrived from @entity14 nine years ago , said accepting change is not a simple thing			0
' it 's not easy , but the faithful people in these kinds of situations know to trust in @entity194 ' the priest said			0
' we are a faithful people			0
we have confidence because @entity194 has his plan			0
' historian @entity198 , a @entity14 exile who teaches at @entity201 and has written about the @entity48 church , said most @entity8 will welcome the pope 's intervention as an effort to increase religious freedom on the island			1
' he 's very concerned over the decline of @entity21 fervor , primarily in @entity210 but also even in the @entity15 and @entity211 , so of course he sees it important to have a high profile for the @entity8 in @entity14 , ' @entity198 said .			1
