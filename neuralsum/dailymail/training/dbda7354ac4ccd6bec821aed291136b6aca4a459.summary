a tattoo artist was stunned to discover his picture on the front of a t - shirt being sold worldwide by high street chain @entity4 , without his knowledge			1
@entity6 , known as @entity7 , felt angry and cheated when he found out the white tops , bearing his image and the words ‘ @entity11 runs through my veins ’ , were on sale in stores all over the world			1
the 36 - year - old 's plight drew comparisons with the recent high - profile @entity19 case , when the singer successfully sued @entity21 for using her image on a t - shirt			1
@entity6 aka @entity26 , a tattoo artist from @entity27 , whose image has been used on a t shirt without his permission @entity26 , of @entity27 , @entity31 , said : ' i spoke to to @entity19 ’s lawyers and they said i had a good case for defamation , it could seem satanic because of the quote			1
' musician @entity26 said he had pictures taken in june , 2012 , for the website for his new studio in @entity40			1
they were on the website the next month , and he heard about the t - shirts appearing in @entity4 in august this year			1
after doing a bit of searching he found out that the images had gone on sale at the retail chain in may this year			2
' i had pictures taken for the studio website and quite a few images ended up being used			2
@entity26 had the photo taken for his new website and was shocked to see it on a t - shirt for sale a year later ' it was a while later that somebody told me they had seen a picture of me on a t - shirt in @entity4 in @entity61			1
i got in a car and drove over to @entity61 and it was there as soon as i walked in			2
' initially i though it was part of a small capsule collection but then i started getting pictures from friends of them popping up all over @entity71 and then in the @entity72			0
' now it has sold out worldwide , so it must have been popular			0
' i have n’t pursued anything yet legally			0
i need to find out whether it was sold in the right way , ' said @entity26			0
the former clothes shop owner said because he his covered with tattoos he is used to people wanting to take his picture for clothing labels , but has turned them down			2
@entity19 successfully sued @entity21 over the t - shirt bearing the picture of her face ( left ) , and the brand was banned from selling them but now his face is plastered all over the high street t - shirt			1
' i feel peeved and cheated especially as there are other brands i have turned down for this type of thing			0
' i ’ve never had an apology from anyone about this and i ’ve not seen a penny from any of the sales , ' said the hip - hop artist			1
@entity26 said he would like this incident to make the @entity101 public aware that they do n’t own the copyright to their own image , something he finds ' absolutely insane ' the photographer was @entity108 of @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity31			0
he said he did take pictures of the tattoo studio for free and did not sign over copyright of his images			0
@entity108 said : ' under @entity101 copyright law i can do as i wish with the images , and i own the copyright			0
' i do n't want to say anything else			0
' when contacted by @entity119 for comment @entity4 said : ' the image in question is bought from an image agency that has an agreement with @entity7			1
' however @entity26 says he had no knowledge of thew photos use			2
essentially the law says that whoever took the photograph owns the copyright to it and can do with it as they wish			0
this applies whether it is a friend , a professional photographer or a stranger on the street			0
the subject of a photograph may occasionally have moral right to limit its distribution if they do n't want it published , or picture is embarrassing or sensitive in nature , but not always			2
the subject with moral rights can limit publication regardless of whether it ’s sensitive , but it is not guaranteed			0
the only way to ensure a photo of you does n't end up anywhere you do n't approve of is to buy the copyright off the photographer ... or take every picture yourself .			1
