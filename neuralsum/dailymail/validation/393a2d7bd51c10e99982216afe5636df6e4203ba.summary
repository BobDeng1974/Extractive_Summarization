cuts of 20 per cent to the police budget by the @entity2 will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror , a retiring senior officer has warned			1
sir @entity7 , the retiring president of the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , claims the ' tipping point ' between cutting resources and staff and increasing the risk to the public is close			1
since 2011 the @entity13 reduced the amount spent on police by 20 per cent and the home secretary @entity16 has said there will be further cuts if the @entity19 win the forthcoming election			1
sir @entity7 , the retiring president of the @entity8 , warns that cuts to the police budget of 20 per cent , proposed by the @entity19 , will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror one way some forces are reportedly going to try to operate on smaller budgets is by reducing the number of officers			1
sir @entity7 , who is due to stand down ahead of the creation of the @entity31 , told the @entity32 that taking police off the streets is a clear risk in the fight against extremism			1
he said : ' the critical element , it seems to me , with dealing with people who will start to behave differently in their communities is the confidence in that community to speak to the local cops			0
' if the cops are n't there and that relationship has not been built we wo n't get the intelligence			0
' asked directly whether police would have adequate resources to protect the public in the context of cuts , he said : ' in my professional judgement , the answer is no. ' he added that cuts to other public services had put an increased pressure on the police , with officers having to fill in for ambulance crews and those let down by depleted mental health care			1
sir @entity7 , who left @entity8 two weeks ago , said while it is accepted police can not be exempt from cuts , he questioned how much more the forces can take			1
he added that 44 police forces is too many and collaboration is important and cited the work of sir @entity71 , chief constable in @entity72 , who has brought together eight forces , where crime is at an all - time low			1
@entity75 mp , @entity76 's shadow home secretary , said cuts would take spending back to 1930s levels and would sign the end of neighbourhood policing @entity76 has claimed another 30,000 police officers could be lost if the @entity2 are returned to power in may			1
almost 7,000 police community support officers could also be cut by 2020 , @entity76 said , after commissioning figures from the @entity86 based on trends during the current @entity88			2
@entity75 mp , @entity76 's shadow home secretary , said : ' conservative plans to cut spending back to 1930s levels would mean the end of neighbourhood policing			1
' these figure show that under these extreme and risky @entity2 plans a further 30,000 police officers could be lost - the equivalent of almost the entire metropolitan police force			1
' this is on top of the 17,000 cut since 2010 and would mean police numbers falling by a third after ten years of the @entity19			2
and it would mean we would have fewer than 100,000 police officers			2
' more serious and violent crimes including child abuse , rape and domestic violence are being reported , the terror threat has grown , and there has been a massive increase in online crime			0
' metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity112 said his force had lost about 15 per cent of its grant , £ 600 million , in 12 months			1
it had managed to maintain police numbers by making savings in the back office - they had lost 3,500 staff and buildings had been sold			2
he told @entity122 : ' we have maintained the front line , so we are proud of that			0
over the next few years , it is going to get very hard			0
' he said he feared that after the next government gets in , the force will lose another 15 per cent , a total of a third , or £ 1.4 billion			2
' when we have to find that amount , numbers will drop , ' he said			0
' we will have less police , we will have to manage it			0
' we have still got to invest in counter terrorism , if people out there are trying to kill us , we 'd better do something about it , and that means a lot of hard work			0
' a @entity13 spokesman said : ' police reform is working and crime has fallen by more than a fifth under this government , according to the @entity147			2
' while we acknowledge that the police funding settlement is challenging , there is no question that the police will still have the resources to do their important work			0
' what matters is how officers are deployed , not how many of them there are in total			0
' the reduction in crime nationwide demonstrates there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels , the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided			0
' the spokesman added : ' @entity168 has found that the police are successfully meeting the challenge of balancing their books while protecting the frontline and delivering reductions in crime			0

sir @entity7 is retiring president of @entity8
he claims ' tipping point ' between resource cuts and risk to public is close
@entity13 has reduced spending on police by 20 per cent since 2011
@entity16 , home secretary , said further cuts due if @entity2 's win election
former chief constable said police are already *burdened* by wider cuts
