more @entity0 over 50 are getting divorced than ever before			1
a study out of @entity3 ’s @entity2 found that 1 out of every 4 divorced person nationwide fits is considered a late in life divorcee			1

that 's double the rate seen in 1990 trending : more @entity0 over 50 are getting divorced than ever and at twice the rate in 1990 , the trend could continue the study used data from the @entity25 ’s @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , which asks respondents if they ’ve been divorced in the last 12 months			1
when paired with other census data , the @entity24 allowed researchers @entity28 and @entity30 to pin age and other demographics onto a respondent ’s divorce history			2
a study out of @entity2 - based @entity8 gives surprising results about older @entity0 and divorces			1

they are followed by @entity47 , then whites , and @entity49 in late in life marriage statistics			2
better educated @entity0 are less likely to divorce after 50 than are the less educated			1
lead researcher @entity28 attributes the change to several factors , including : first off , the data told them that divorce rates had continue to increase in those over 50 while rates had begun to plateau in other group			1
‘ this surprised us , because the rate for younger people has leveled off , ’ @entity28 , a sociology professor , told the @entity60			2
‘ in 1990 , only 1 in 10 divorces were people 50 and older			1
’ a recent example of the trend can be seen in documentary filmmaker @entity69			2
in june , @entity69 filed a complaint against his wife @entity71 , who is 55 , after 21 years of marriage			0
according to @entity28 , the change is rooted in several contemporary demographic shifts			0
@entity28 says that ‘ that huge segment of baby boomers ’ who have now entered their ‘ senior ’ years are simply more prevalent			0

african - americans were most likely to divorce late in life			0
hispanics less likely , followed by whites and @entity49 , who were the least likely to divorce after 50			2
education level also played a role and the more you ’ve had the less likely you are to divorce			0
meanwhile , rates of widowhood , the study revealed , have gone down			2
however , @entity28 says society should n’t forget the plight of yesterday ’s spouse left alone in his or her old age			0
‘ we need to look at these people the way we 've looked at widowhood			0
many need help financially , ’ she says			0
‘ they had fewer kids , and the kids are n't always nearby , so they more often have to look outside the family for caregiving			0
’ race affected late in life divorce as well			0
blacks were the most likely to get one , followed by @entity47 , then whites , then @entity49			0
