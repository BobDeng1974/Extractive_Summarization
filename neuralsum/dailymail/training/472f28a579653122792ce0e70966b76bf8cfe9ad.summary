the drug seeks out and ' silences ' compounds doctors are using a type of arthritis drug to treat sciatica - the pain associated with a slipped disc			1
the drug seeks out and ' silences ' compounds involved in inflammation - and early trials show that it can banish pain completely			1
sciatica is caused by irritation and inflammation of the sciatic nerve , the longest nerve in the body , which runs from the back of the pelvis , through the buttocks , and down both legs to the feet			2
sciatica is usually described as a sharp , shooting or burning pain , which radiates down the back towards the foot or ankle			2
most attacks occur when the discs that cushion the bones of the spine begin to bulge or move out of position ( known as ' slipping ' ) , pressing on the nerve and triggering inflammation			0
treatments include painkillers , physiotherapy and steroid injections but , in some cases , surgery may be necessary to remove the disc			0
the arthritis drug adalimumab may provide another option			0
the drug is a man - made version of a type of immune system compound called an antibody			1
these are highly targeted molecules programmed by the body to seek out specific bacteria or viruses			1
scientists programme the synthetic antibody to target a specific compound in the body called tumour necrosis factor alpha ( @entity59 )			1
normally , this compound rises shortly after the body is infected with a bug			2
this increases inflammation and helps mobilise immune system cells to fight the invader			1
however - for reasons that are still unknown - in certain so - called autoimmune conditions , such as rheumatoid arthritis or the skin condition psoriasis , levels of @entity59 are permanently high			2
this means that the immune system is constantly in a state of high - alert , which may cause the immune cells to malfunction and mistakenly attack healthy cells			1
studies suggest that people with sciatica also have high levels of @entity59 , which contributes to the pain of the condition			1
in one study of 49 sciatica patients at the @entity88 in @entity89 , around half of the patients who received a similar drug to block @entity59 had a 100 per cent reduction in leg pain , compared with a placebo			1
in a new trial at five hospitals across the @entity96 ( in @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 ) , 300 patients will receive three injections of the drug adalimumab two weeks apart , or a placebo			2
in a new @entity96 trial 300 patients will receive three injections of the drug adalimumab they will also be given regular sessions of physiotherapy , and be monitored for two years			0
commenting on the trial , @entity110 , of @entity111 , the charity that pioneered the use of this therapy for rheumatoid arthritis , says : ' this treatment has transformed the treatment of inflammatory arthritis worldwide			0
' it 's not a cure , but for those people in whom it does work , the results can be dramatic			0
' @entity126 can be caused by inflammation of the sciatic nerve , and @entity59 is an important molecule in inflammation , so blocking its action could have a big impact			0
' applying anti-tnf to sciatica is a novel approach , and we await the findings of this study with considerable interest			0
' meanwhile , research has linked being overweight with an increased risk of back pain and sciatica			0
a new study from scientists at the @entity145 - based on more than 300,000 men and women - showed that overweight people had a 23 per cent greater risk of low back pain , and a 12 per cent increased risk of sciatica			1
among the obese , the risk of back pain rose by 40 per cent , and sciatica by 54 per cent .			0
