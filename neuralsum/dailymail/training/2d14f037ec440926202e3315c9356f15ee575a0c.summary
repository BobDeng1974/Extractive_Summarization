@entity1 is preparing to hammer the owners of expensive homes to pay for an increase in spending on the @entity5 , it emerged yesterday			1
the @entity6 told the @entity8 conference in @entity9 that his party would impose a mansion tax on houses worth more than £ 2million			1
he said the £ 2 billion raised each year would be used to help ‘ safeguard our vital public services ’			1
indicating that the @entity5 would be the chief beneficiary , he said @entity8 would do ‘ whatever it takes ’ to preserve the health service			1
he also confirmed that @entity8 would scrap the @entity30 ’s marriage tax break – money which would be used to pay for the restoration of the 10p tax rate			1
but the speech was met with silence from delegates			1
and there was some booing when he said the retirement age would have to rise in future years			1
mr @entity1 confirmed @entity8 would introduce the plan , originally floated by the @entity41 , to levy a tax on the ‘ highest - value properties – a mansion tax on houses worth over £ 2 million ’			1
the speech was met with silence from delegates and there wasbooing when he said retirement age would rise ‘ we will do it in a fair , sensible and proportionate way ; raising the limit each year in line with average rises in house prices , ’ he said			1
‘ how can it be right that the billionaire overseas buyer this year of a £ 140 million penthouse in @entity60 will pay just £ 26 a week in property tax – the same as the average - value property in that area ? ’ @entity8 would not say how much the mansion tax would raise			1
the @entity41 have estimated it would raise £ 1.7 billion a year , but @entity8 ’s higher bands for homes worth tens of millions could raise more			1
mr @entity1 warned of fresh welfare cuts , including keeping the cap on child benefit for another two years			2
‘ we will have to make other decisions which i know will not be popular with everyone , ’ he said , highlighting plans to raise the state retirement age and scrap the winter fuel allowance			2
labour leader @entity77 is expected to focus on the @entity5 in his conference speech today , and mr @entity1 appeared to hint that more funding could be found to shore up services			1
@entity1 feeling the pressure at a @entity83 fringe meeting after the @entity8 conference yesterday mr @entity1 warned of fresh welfare cuts , including keeping the cap on child benefit for another two years ‘ next year , after just five years of @entity87 – with waiting times rising , fewer nurses and a crisis in @entity91 – we will have to save the @entity5 from the @entity93 once again , ’ he said			1
‘ and we will do what it takes			0
’ in an attempt to shore up his party ’s economic credentials , mr @entity1 said the party had to show it had ‘ learned ’ and was ready to be ‘ honest with the country about what the last @entity8 government got right and what we got wrong ’			1
among the errors he listed were the lifting of transitional controls on migration from new @entity110 states in 2004 , and not regulating banks strongly enough before the credit crunch – although he stopped short of saying @entity8 had overspent before the financial crisis			0
‘ the truth is we should have regulated those banks in a tougher way , ’ he said			0
labour leader @entity77 ( right ) is expected to focus on the @entity5 in his conference speech today , and mr @entity1 ( left ) appeared to hint that more funding could be found to shore up services ‘ it was a mistake			1
we should apologise for it			0
’ he said the @entity8 government had also failed to tackle the ‘ underlying causes of rising spending on housing benefit and in - work poverty ’ , and should not have abolished the 10p tax rate			1
the @entity128 said @entity130 ’s speech committed @entity8 to an extra £ 20.4 billion of spending			1
business minister @entity131 said : ‘ @entity8 have n’t learned their lesson			0
they would burden our children with more debt than our children could ever hope to repay			0
’ it was more about posturing than policy home affairs editor @entity140 looks at @entity1 ’s promises , and concludes they were more about show than reality : @entity1 attended a @entity145 in @entity9 after announcing @entity8 would keep the child benefit cap incoming @entity8 ministers will take a 5 per cent pay cut a populist gesture which will not make so much as a ripple in the ocean of public debt			2
the current government cut ministerial salaries by 5 per cent in 2010 and then froze them at that level for the duration of the @entity157 , saving £ 3 million			2
mr @entity1 ’s announcement amounts to a deficit cut of 0.003 per cent			0
save £ 400 million by capping rises in child benefit at 1 per cent this real terms cut – inflation is currently 2 per cent – will raise very little			2
the @entity30 has put the policy in place until 2016			0
@entity8 would simply extend it by another year			0
treasury sources say the additional savings made by mr @entity1 would be just £ 120 million			2
raise minimum wage from £ 6.31 to £ 8 by the end of the next @entity157 @entity8 claims that applying the policy to the public sector would not cost any money , since the @entity174 would save in benefit payments currently made to top - up the income of the low - paid			1
however , business leaders warn the policy will be hugely expensive and lead to firms employing fewer workers			0
reverse the government ’s ‘ £ 3 billion tax cut ’ for highest - rate taxpayers political positioning , designed to fuel the politics of envy , which might even cost the @entity187 money if top - earners respond by leaving the country , or find new ways of avoiding tax			1
a study for @entity194 found that @entity196 ’s decision to cut the 50p rate to 45p reduced tax revenues by only £ 100 million			1
reimposing the 50p rate would raise a similar amount at best – and nothing like £ 3 billion			2
( left to right ) shadow chancellor @entity1 , labour leader @entity77 , deputy labour leader @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and shadow business secretary @entity205 at @entity206 scrap the married couples tax break more political posturing			1
the tax allowance is @entity87 ’s flagship policy for recognising the importance of strong families , but labours claim it amounts to social engineering			2
over the course of the next @entity157 , scrapping it will save £ 3 billion			2
the money will be spent on a new 10p tax rate for the lowest paid , not paying down the deficit			2
axe winter fuel payments for the better - off this would affect 600,000 people over 61 and will save only £ 100 million			2
it is worth recalling that @entity8 introduced the payments in the first place			0
balance the books mr @entity130 ’s boldest claim , but experts say that , if @entity8 is elected , @entity230 will borrow significantly more			0
on paying down the debt , mr @entity130 ’s timeframe is only ‘ as soon as possible ’			0
the @entity233 said @entity8 ’s plans would allow mr @entity1 to spend £ 28 billion more than the chancellor over the course of the next parliament , all of it borrowed			1
increase corporation tax and impose a new financial transactions tax analysis by the @entity242 warns that , overall , the tax changes planned by @entity8 will do great harm – costing the @entity230 300,000 jobs and more than £ 25 billion in gdp by damaging confidence and reducing investment			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the consequences for gdp and employment will be negative			0
’ a scene from the hit 1965 film @entity255 , which @entity1 admitted makes him ' cry every time ' from the rough and tumble of the @entity257 to illegal tackles on the football pitch , @entity1 has a reputation as a bit of a bruiser			0
it turns out , however , that he also has a soft side – admitting that he cries every time he watches @entity255			0
the @entity6 spoke yesterday of his love for the 1965 musical about a nun called @entity269 who becomes a governess to the seven children of captain @entity272 , an @entity273 widower			0
an audience at the @entity8 conference laughed as he gave an account of his family holiday with wife @entity278 , the shadow home secretary , and their three children on a @entity282 in @entity283			2
the family made their own clothes out of curtains and ran through meadows , singing songs from the film			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ it was a three - hour trip where we each had a bike with a basket like @entity269 , and a beatbox with all the songs and you go on a guided tour playing the music			0
you run through a meadow			0
‘ and then @entity278 said if we do it we must make clothes out of curtains , so we bought some curtain material and on the train to @entity283 we sat there sewing lederhosen for the teenage lads			0
the girls and women had head scarves			0
’ asked if the movie made him cry , he said : ‘ every time			0
in the end , he marries @entity269 and they dodge the @entity315 , and every time you watch it you never know if they are going to make it			0

shadow chancellor said party will impose mansion tax on homes over £ 2m
said revenue would be used to help ' safeguard our vital public services '
