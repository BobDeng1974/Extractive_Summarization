controversial : women can now buy a morning - after pill that works for up to five days after sex - without having to see a gp			1
this picture is posed by a model women can now buy a morning - after pill that works for up to five days after sex – without having to see a gp			1
from today , any woman aged 18 or over will for the first time be able to buy the powerful medication – called @entity9 – from certain branches of the @entity11			1
but campaigners say that because it can be taken so long after conception it is an early form of abortion			1
there are also concerns that it will encourage unprotected sex as women will see it as a ‘ safety net ’ – leading to higher rates of promiscuity and sexually transmitted infections			1
ellaone can be taken longer after sex than the conventional morning - after pill – which works for three days – and is up to twice as effective at preventing pregnancies			0
until now it has only been possible to get @entity9 with a prescription from a gp – or from an obscure @entity32 - based website which also sells @entity33 and weight - loss drugs			2
but from today it will be on sale for £ 30 in some 40 co-op branches in southern @entity38 and @entity39 in areas with high rates of unwanted pregnancies			0
it works by thickening the entrance of the womb , preventing sperm from entering and swimming up to fertilise the egg if taken in the first day or so after sex			0
in addition , it changes the womb ’s lining , meaning that if the pill is taken up to five days after sex , a fertilised egg can not implant itself and develop into a foetus			0
but @entity57 , director of the charity @entity59 , described it as an early method of abortion , and said there was no evidence that these sorts of pills reduced unwanted pregnancies			0
‘ instead , young people in particular have been lulled into a false sense of security , taken a more casual attitude to sex , and become exposed to an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections , ’ he added			2
@entity75 , of the charity life , said : ‘ @entity78 concerns around these kind of pills are often overlooked			0
one of the ways in which they can work , as the manufacturers themselves say , is by preventing the implantation of an already fertilised embryo			0
powerful : from today , any woman aged 18 or over will for the first time be able to buy the medication - called @entity9 - from certain branches of the @entity11 ‘ there is even some evidence that provision of these pills can actually worsen rates of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections			1
‘ this may be due to risk - compensation , when the existence of a perceived safety net encourages less cautious behaviour			1
’ @entity100 , clinical service pharmacist at the @entity11 , said : ‘ it is not our place to make a judgment on people ’s motives or lifestyles and there can be numerous reasons for seeking medical help			2
‘ its use is an emotive subject and we believe that this service will be an important step to offer women access to a wider choice of emergency contraception in a community pharmacy to enable them to make an informed decision			0
’ women wanting @entity9 will be questioned by a pharmacist to check their age , and that they are n’t already pregnant or on any medication which could cause complications			1
if pharmacists think someone is under 18 – and they can not provide @entity128 to prove otherwise – they will be refused the pill , as it has not been properly tested in younger women			2
side - effects include nausea , vomiting , headaches , mood swings and back pain , similar to the conventional morning - after pill			0
studies have shown that 0.91 per cent of women who took @entity9 became pregnant , compared with 1.68 per cent of those who took the conventional morning - after pill .			2
