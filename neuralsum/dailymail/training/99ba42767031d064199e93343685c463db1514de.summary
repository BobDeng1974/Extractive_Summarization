@entity0 has plans to put a @entity2 on the road in two years that wo n't require drivers to hold a steering wheel or put their foot on the gas			2
@entity0 is calling the new technology ' @entity9 , ' promising it will be able to master steering , acceleration , stopping - and - going in gridlocked traffic , and braking at highway speeds of 70 miles per hour			1
chief executive officer @entity15 described the groundbreaking model in a speech to the @entity18 in @entity19			0
these vehicles could advise each other on speed , the direction cars are traveling , and location			0
if a driver ahead of your vehicle slams on their brakes , the information can be transmitted to other drivers to prepare for the sudden halt in traffic			2
those safety features will be even more useful when @entity0 finishes developing its first intelligent highways in @entity19			1
those roads will feature cameras and sensors to warn cars about upcoming traffic			2
however , to operate these systems without using the steering wheel or pedals themselves , drivers must remain alert to take the wheel when traffic conditions need real judgement			1
model featuring @entity21 , or ' vehicle - to - vehicle , ' technology within the next two years			2
the @entity9 will initially be featured in the 2017 @entity24 sedan , according to @entity66			0
that feature will enable cars to communicate with other cars , warn of traffic hazards , and ideally make roads safer			0
' with @entity9 , when there ’s a congestion alert on roads like @entity77 's @entity76 , you can let the car take over and drive hands free and feet free through the worst stop - and - go traffic around , ” @entity15 said			1
' if the mood strikes you on the high - speed road from @entity84 , @entity77 , to @entity85 , you can take a break from the wheel and pedals and let the car do the work			0
having it done for you -- that ’s true luxury			0
' @entity94 @entity93 notes that today 's autonomous vehicles are required to have all the same manual controls that are found in normal vehicles , and a licensed driver operating the car must be able to take over at any moment			1
@entity0 is cautioning that this technology is not a self - driving car , and that drivers must be alert and able to take the wheel when traffic conditions require it			1
' we ’re rolling out active safety technology today			0
we ’re not going to wait until we have a driverless vehicle that can work in 100 per cent of situations , ' said @entity111 , @entity0 's chief technology officer			1
' there ’s a lot that can be done before we get to the perfect driverless technology			0
' @entity0 's new communications system could help cars avoid crashing and reduce gridlock by having cars within 300 meters of each other communicate basic safety information @entity0 is cautioning that this technology is not a self - driving car , and that drivers must be alert and able to take the wheel when traffic conditions require it the @entity9 will be available on in the second half of 2016			1
@entity0 is also partnering with @entity127 , the @entity128 , and the @entity129 to build 120 - miles of ' intelligent highways ' in @entity19			1
the roads will be able to communicate with vehicles and warn of upcoming hazards using sensors and cameras			2
@entity0 officials promise any information gathered by the sensors will not be given to police to ticket drivers , and the @entity129 is calling it ' the largest deployment of connected vehicle and highway technology in the world			1
' @entity0 also partnering with @entity128 and @entity129 to build ' intelligent ' roads around @entity19 that capture and transmit traffic information using cameras and sensors it 's uncertain when the project will be completed			1
the vehicle - to - vehicle communication protocols are being developed in conjuction with the @entity153			0
that 's the same organization that 's overseen @entity0 's record 29 million recalls this year			1
however industry analysts note that some buyers will worry about the car 's safety features , especially after @entity0 produced faulty ignition switches linked to 13 deaths			2
' there is still a concern by consumers about the safety of their vehicles because there ’s been so many recalls , ' said @entity169 , an analyst with @entity170			0
' this is going to take a while to win the confidence of consumers			0
' @entity15 tells reporters she knows the technology must be perfect to be a success			0
' it ’s critical that it works flawlessly every single time , ' @entity15 told reporters			0
' when you look at what has got to come together to make this happen -- not just for straight driving on a section of highway , but for every city situation you can imagine -- there ’s quite a bit of technology that has to come together to make this work			0
' however industry analysts note that some buyers will worry about the car 's safety features , especially after @entity0 produced faulty ignition switches linked to 13 deaths if @entity0 , or any of the automakers competing to get the first self - driving car to consumers , can get the technology bug - free they might lower traffic fatalities and reduce gridlock			1
in the @entity207 alone , the cost of economic and social impact of car crashes is more than $ 870 billion annually , @entity0 stated , citing figures from the @entity153			2
' it ’s a chicken - and - egg technology , ' said @entity210 , @entity0 ’s director of global safety strategies and vehicle programs			1
' if nobody in two years from now puts out a @entity21 car , then the first @entity24 off the line will have to wait for the next @entity24 to talk to			0

' @entity218 ' vehicles must have a driver capable of taking control of the vehicle at any moment to be *legally* operated
@entity0 's ' @entity9 ' technology will master steering , acceleration , stop - and - go in gridlocked traffic , and braking at highway speeds of 70 *mph*
technology will allow car to trade information about traffic conditions with vehicles up to 300 meters away
@entity0 also partnering with @entity128 and @entity129 to build ' intelligent ' roads around @entity19 that capture and transmit traffic information using cameras and sensors
