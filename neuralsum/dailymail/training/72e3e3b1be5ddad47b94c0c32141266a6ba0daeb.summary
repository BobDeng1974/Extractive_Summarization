by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:30 pm on 19th july 2011 a software designer told prosecutors in the @entity5 trial she searched for ' chloroform ' once not 84 times , as they asserted			1
as soon as @entity9 realised the mistake he alerted prosecution lawyers and the police , but had already testified against @entity13 on june 8			1
mr @entity9 claims the revised research was not presented to the jury and the record was never corrected			1
that search led to sci - spot.com , also visited once , which gave information on the use of the chemical in the 1800s			0
the 84 searches for chloroform was a lynch pin in the prosecution 's case to suggest that @entity13 had planned to murder her two - year - old daughter @entity5			1
loss : the 84 searches for chloroform was a lynch pin in the prosecution 's case to suggest that @entity13 had planned to murder her two - year - old daughter @entity5 testify : @entity13 's mother @entity48 revealed she searched for chloroform but later prosecutors suggested she made the story up to protect her daughter mr @entity9 thought he was being called to testify about his @entity54 software			1
but instead said he found himself being asked repeatedly about a @entity56 report			0
this report , written by police in august 2008 , detailed @entity13 's internet search history using @entity61 software			1
despite being a witness mr @entity9 said he was never told about the report by police or the prosecution			1
' i had translated the data into something meaningful for the police , ' mr @entity9 told the @entity70			1
' then i turned it over to them			0
the no. 1 principle for them is to validate the data , and they had the tools and resources to do it			0
' suspicious , and also concerned a woman 's life was at risk - @entity13 faced the death penalty if convicted - mr @entity9 redesigned his software to check the police data			1
he found both reports inaccurate - although @entity61 had arrived at the correct result			0
both types of software had failed to fully decode the entire search file			0
where is she ? @entity13 was released from jail last week and could have fled to @entity94 , @entity95 , according to reports roll up , roll up for your chance to dunk @entity5 , or at least someone who looks vaguely like her			1
it may be poor taste but organisers at the annual @entity103 in @entity104 have set up an @entity13 - themed dunking booth right at the front of the showground			1
for a fee , fair goers can choose whether @entity13 is guilty or not guilty - despite the fact she has already been acquitted of murdering her two - year - old daughter @entity5			1
the participant then hurls a ball at his chosen target and , if he gets a direct hit , the woman sitting behind bars heckling the crowd is plunged into water			0
' we 're hoping that it 's taken in a fun way so that people coming out can release some of their frustrations about what just happened in the last few months and they can show their opinion , ' fair organiser @entity121 told @entity130			1
watch the video below ... after going through everything again mr @entity9 found sci - spot.com was visited just once			2
mr @entity9 said he immediately contacted prosecutor , @entity135 , and sgt @entity136 of the @entity137 in late june via email and by phone to tell them of the mistake			2
sergeant @entity136 said he was aware of the discrepancy , according to mr @entity9			1
' i gave the police everything they needed to present a new report , ' mr @entity9 said			2
' i did the work myself and copied out the entire database in a spreadsheet to make sure there was no issue of accessibility to the data			0
' he even offered to fly to @entity155 at his own expense to go through the findings			0
despite @entity13 being cleared of murder , the revelations have angered her defence			2
defence lawyer @entity162 told the @entity70 it was ' outrageous ' that prosecutors withheld critical information on the ' chloroform ' searches			0
' the prosecution is absolutely obligated to bring forth to the court any and all evidence that could be exculpatory , ' mr @entity162 said			0
' if in fact this is true , and the prosecution concealed this new information , it is more than shame on them			0
' ' this was a major part of their case , ' mr @entity162 added			0
spokesman for the @entity181 , captain @entity182 , hit back at the claims saying mr @entity9 had a vested interest in coming forward because his software was used			2
' we ’re not going to relive the trial again , ' captain @entity186 said			0
' we are not prepared to do that nor are we going to participate in that			0
' the @entity191 in @entity155 did not immediately return a call for comment			0
@entity13 was released from the @entity195 jail she has been in for the past three years last sunday and has n't been seen since			2
however she may have fled to @entity94 , @entity95 , according to the @entity198			1
the private @entity200 jet @entity13 was whisked away on that morning is owned by @entity95 attorney @entity202 's firm , according to the news programme			1
@entity202 had , at one point , been a member of @entity13 's defence team and had given her $ 70,000			2
the firm has an office at the @entity209 in @entity94			2
the plane ' enables us to travel anywhere within the @entity213 in seven hours , ' according to the company 's website .			0

designer @entity9 discovered the discrepancy and ' alerted prosecution '
he had testified against @entity13 but became suspicious data was not correct
jury not told and record not straight about findings
@entity13 may have fled to @entity94 , @entity95
