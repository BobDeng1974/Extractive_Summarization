police arrested 173,0000 foreign crime suspects last year – one in every seven people who were apprehended nationwide			1
the figures from @entity4 reveal the extraordinary strain being placed on the justice system by overseas criminals			1
in many cases , the suspects have lengthy criminal records back home which should have prevented them from entering the @entity12 – or would allow for them to be deported			1
police arrested 173,0000 foreign criminals last year – one in every seven suspects who were apprehended nationwide but , alarmingly , police are only bothering to carry out checks in only 30 per cent of cases and in some force areas it is as low as six per cent			1
it means offenders who should have been detained are being bailed or , when they appear before the @entity12 courts , are not being sentenced properly because judges do not know about their criminal past			1
@entity28 , chairman of the @entity30 select committee , said : ‘ it is simply unacceptable that people with serious convictions could be allowed to enter the @entity12 in the first place			0
‘ we need to tighten up our borders and get as much information as possible from our @entity39 partners			0
’ the figures , released by @entity41 to a @entity43 investigation , showed 14 per cent of all arrests in @entity45 and @entity46 last year were foreign nationals			1
( @entity48 ) the @entity49 told the @entity43 that the failure to carry proper checks is the result of the @entity53 not having access to up to date computer and information sharing systems			0
in 2006 , the @entity57 declined to join up to a @entity59 - wide information sharing regime , known as the @entity61 that would have given access to alerts on known criminals			2
it leaves @entity12 as one of only four countries out of 32 in the @entity68 that can not access the data			0
under the @entity73 arrangement , 2.5million alerts about @entity39 criminals are issued every year			1
the @entity12 does receive some information under separate data sharing arrangements – but missing out on half , or a disturbing 1.25million			0
there is a separate computer system , known as @entity79 , which the @entity12 does have access to – but can only be used when a suspect is already inside the @entity12 ’s borders			0
@entity28 , chairman of the @entity30 select committee , said the revelations were ' simply unacceptable ' in only three out of every ten cases are officers bothering to use it			2
during october , there were huge differences between the number of checks carried out by individual forces			0
@entity94 ’s the @entity93 – which is running a specific operation to deport more foreign offenders – did checks in 100 per cent of cases			1
but for @entity100 the figure was only eight per cent			0
for @entity102 and the @entity103 , it was just six per cent			0
the @entity49 said the system for tracking foreign offenders was in chaos			2
the @entity53 has lost track of 760 of the 4,200 criminals who have been freed back on to our streets , including 58 ‘ high harm ’ individuals – a category that includes rapists , killers and drug dealers			1
despite a ten-fold increase in case workers , the number of foreign prisoners has gone up by four per cent , to 10,649			2
meanwhile , one in six overseas inmates freed from jail has absconded the row follows a devastating report last week by the chief inspector of immigration which revealed how foreign criminals – including a killer – had been able to obtain @entity12 citizenship			1
@entity53 staff are not bothering to check for criminal records in a person ’s homeland which could lead to their application being turned down			1
yesterday , shadow home secretary @entity134 claimed that , under @entity57 , ‘ stronger checks ’ will be carried out			2
anyone seeking citizenship would have to produce the equivalent of @entity140 documentation from their homeland			0
she told @entity144 's @entity143 : ‘ i think it 's shocking that we have had people including serious criminals and killers being given @entity12 passports and @entity12 citizenship because the @entity53 failed to do basic checks			2
’ conservative backbencher @entity153 blamed @entity39 rules on free movement for allowing criminals into the @entity12			2
he said : ‘ if someone is coming from the @entity39 , and we 're talking about hundreds of thousands each year , there are no controls			0
they 're not allowed to have controls , the @entity39 wo n't let you			0
’ @entity41 chief executive @entity164 said that , while criminal record checks had been carried out on only 30 per cent of suspects in 2013/14 , progress had since been made			1
for the single month of october 2014 , checks were made in 67 per cent of cases .			0
