@entity1 winger @entity0 has done his own soul - searching following the unedifying sight of @entity5 's @entity4 clutching his face in fake agony despite being shoved several inches lower , in the chest , by the @entity10 international			1
@entity4 has been rightly castigated for falsely trying to get a fellow professional in trouble during last weekend 's hostile encounter at @entity14 , but as a father to two - year - old son @entity16 , @entity0 also accepts responsibility for his role in the incident			1
accepting that footballers have a duty to their audience of varying ages , he does n't think he was right to push @entity24 in the first place after a set - to sparked by his foul on @entity5 's @entity27			1
@entity4 reacted over the top to a push from @entity0 last weekend at @entity14 @entity4 embarrassingly held his head as if he 'd been pushed in the face by the @entity10 winger @entity4 goes down clutching his face in agony despite not getting any contact near his face ' the sad thing for me , reflecting on it , was that it was also a bit stupid of myself to react in the way i did			1
i always try to give a good positive image , ' said @entity0			1
' a yellow card could have been a red card offence so i think i was lucky with my own reaction			0
in a match , things sometimes happen that are a source of regret afterwards			0
' he 's not letting @entity4 off the hook for his embarrassing play - acting though			1
' it was sad to see simulation of that level , upsetting , ' said @entity0			2
' you go out to be the best role model on the pitch , not just for the fans but the millions of children who watch football too			0
' fortunately for @entity0 , referee @entity63 was n't conned by @entity4 and he is therefore available to face @entity64 on @entity65			1
it 's a game that is important to @entity1 's ambition of qualifying for the @entity68 by topping last season 's fifth - place finish and @entity0 goes to @entity71 having made an impressive comeback last weekend from a hamstring injury that kept him out for almost two months			1
his man - of - the - match performance in thursday night 's 2 - 0 @entity76 win against @entity77 saw the 27 - year - old set up the first goal for compatriot @entity80 , and score the second			2
@entity80 ( right ) and @entity0 both scored as @entity1 defeated @entity77 2 - 0 in the @entity76 @entity0 slotted home @entity1 's second of the game on 75 minutes at the @entity85 the result saw @entity1 qualify for the knockout stages of the competition as winners of @entity90 ' it 's true i am back quicker than the original diagnosis claimed			1
thankfully it did n't turn out to be as serious as they first believed , ' said @entity0			2
' i had some very good care in @entity10 and i have come back strong			0
' i do n't see why our team should n't reach fourth or do even better			0
' @entity1 were n't able to penetrate to the highest levels before , maybe we did n't have the resources or players to do it			2
' but now we are in a position to sign more expensive players , there is a certain stability in the club , players are staying more than in the past and we are able to target higher - quality players that come up for sale			0
' i am not saying it is necessary to go out and splurge and make big purchases , but buying one or two quality players each year results in having the best team possible , and i think that is what we are doing			0
' this year has been excellent , playing in @entity121 competition as well , and i think we are on the right route			0
' while results have picked up after an indifferent start to the season , @entity1 's crowded fixture list has led to injuries with @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 ruled out of the trip to north @entity132 and doubts also surrounding @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			2
it may lead @entity139 to ask @entity0 to play his third game in a week where he will come up against two fellow @entity10 internationals @entity142 and @entity143 , the latter a childhood friend from back home			1
@entity0 has already opened contract talks with the club with his current deal having less than two years to run			0
' everyone is out to get the best they can in terms of their contract in terms of their contract but i will just underline that i am very happy here , ' he said .			0
