by @entity0 a revamped @entity1 will take a leaf out of the @entity3 in @entity4 when it is staged for the first time at the @entity7 in @entity8 next year			1
organisers hope that a ' @entity3 - type format ' will breath new life into the first of the season 's four elite @entity13 ( @entity13 ) events where so often in the past the top players have made early exits			1
instead of the traditional ' tennis - style ' draw where the top seed takes on the 64th seed in the opening round , the 64 players who qualify via the world rankings will be organised into 16 groups of four and guaranteed a minimum of three matches			2
move : @entity28 hits off the 13th tee at @entity7 , the new home of the @entity30 @entity32 venue : @entity34 commissioner @entity33 announces that @entity7 will host the @entity35 in 2020 , the @entity36 in 2025 and the @entity30 at @entity37 in @entity8 ' we 're going to do it differently next year , ' @entity34 commissioner @entity33 told a news conference on wednesday after @entity7 had been announced as the venue for the 2015 edition			1
' it 's going to be a @entity3 - type format			2
' it 's kind of nice that we 're able to talk about that in the context of everybody in the @entity49 being riveted to that format over the last month in @entity4 where we 'll be playing golf in the @entity53 for the first time in ' 16			0
' @entity55 will be returning to the @entity53 for the first time since 1904 when the @entity57 are held in 2016			0
' the 64 players will be broken down into groups of four : 16 groups of four , and then on wednesday , thursday and friday , they 'll all play each other , ' @entity33 said of the new @entity30 format			1
' and then we 'll cut to the top 16 players out of that to play to 16 , eight , four and two on the weekend			0
' the playing format has been revised to help address the fickle nature of the championship where there has never been any guarantee that the game 's top players will still be in the draw from the quarter - final stage onwards			2
final bow : @entity75 of @entity76 won the last @entity77 to be staged at @entity78 in @entity79 showman : @entity81 made the final against day memorable for his outrageous short - game escapes former world no 1 @entity28 is a three - times winner of the event but he has also suffered early disappointment , losing at the first hurdle in 2002 , 2011 and last year and going out in the second round in 2005 , 2009 and 2012			1
this year 's edition , held for the final time at @entity78 in @entity79 suffered with three notable absentees after @entity28 , second - ranked @entity76 @entity93 and five - times major winner @entity94 opted not to play			1
@entity33 outlined three good reasons for the championship 's format change			2
' it 's a lot more golf , ' he said			0
' there are going to be 96 matches for fans here to go out and watch on wednesday , thursday and friday			0
secondly , over time , the best players rise to the top so we think that 'll be positive as it goes into the weekend			0
' third , if you 're a @entity109 fan or a @entity111 fan or a @entity28 fan , you 're going to be able to follow your favourite player for three days hoping that he makes it into the round of 16			0
' it 's a new direction for the @entity30 for sure but one that 's going to create a lot more enthusiasm and excitement			0
' @entity76 @entity75 , the tournament 's eighth seed , won this year 's @entity30 with a one - up victory over @entity124 @entity81 , the 27th seed , after 23 holes in the final .			1
