by @entity1 reporter published : 16:20 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 04:00 est , 11 may 2012 while gay rights activists are lauding the president 's public show of support for same - sex marriages , it has drawn and surprising apology and counter-intuitive criticism from some high - profile figures			2
vice president @entity11 reportedly met with mr @entity12 in the @entity13 on wednesday to apologize for essentially forcing the president 's hand on the issue after he made his own demonstration of support earlier than the commander - in - chief			1
the same day , mr @entity12 was the target of @entity22 ire for the move , including one such blast from the @entity25			1
while her criticism is expected as she is the daughter of former @entity22 vice presidential candidate @entity29 , it was seemingly hypocritical for her to promote the need of fathers and mothers in children ’s lives while she herself is raising her own son on her own and forbidding his father from seeing their child			2
apology : vice president @entity11 met with mr @entity12 on wednesday to apologize for ' forcing his hand ' on the same - sex marriage debate and turning it into a campaign issue before the @entity44 wanted it to be the meeting with mr @entity11 was seen as an attempt to smooth tensions that were raised between the president and his vice president after he spoke out on gay marriage without @entity44 consent , leaving @entity12 aides deeply frustrated			1
mr @entity11 's comments pushed gay marriage to the forefront of the presidential race and focused a fresh spotlight on @entity12 's vague position on the matter			1
the president , who once opposed gay marriage , had been saying for more than a year that his personal views were ' evolving			1
' in an interview with @entity63 , @entity12 said he was n't angry at @entity11 , though he thought the vice president had gotten ' a little bit over his skis ' by voicing his support for gay marriage ahead of his boss			1
' would i have preferred to have done this in my own way , in my own terms , without i think , there being a lot of notice to everybody ? sure , ' @entity12 said			2
' but all 's well that ends well			0
' @entity79 : president @entity12 said he once thought civil unions were sufficient rights for gay couples , but he no longer believes that the @entity44 and @entity12 's presidential campaign at first tried to play down @entity11 's remarks , insisting that the vice president had gone no further in support of equal rights for same - sex couples			1
but gay rights advocates latched onto @entity11 's remarks , which occurred on friday during a taping of an interview that aired on sunday , declaring him the highest - ranking @entity93 official to support gay marriage			1
by tuesday morning , the president came to the conclusion that he could n't stay silent on the issue any further			0
the @entity44 hastily arranged a television interview with @entity63 for wednesday , during which @entity12 explained to the public that he had decided it was important for him to ' affirm that same - sex couples should be able to get married			2
' in response , @entity25 took to her blog to lambast the move , claiming that a child needs a mother and father - even though she is a single mother			2
' we know that in general kids do better growing up in a mother / father home , ' the daughter of former @entity109 governor @entity29 wrote on her blog			0
' ideally , fathers help shape their kids ’ worldview			0
' despite this lecture , she has largely raised her three - year - old son @entity119 on her own , after splitting with his father @entity120 three months after the birth			1
criticism : @entity25 has criticsed @entity12 for supporting gay marriage , saying a child needs a mother and a father			1
she split with @entity120 , right , the father of her son @entity119 , left , three months after he was born ' he ’s seen @entity119 twice in the past four months , ' she told in @entity128 in a recent interview			2
' he once went an entire year without seeing him at all			0
' it comes a day after the president endorsed same - sex marriage in an interview with @entity63			0
many deemed the move as a political calculation for his re-election campaign as it draws a clear distinction between himself and @entity22 @entity139 , who opposes gay marriage			1
' at a certain point i ’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same sex couples should be able to get married , ' the president said			0
@entity12 said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage - a factor that @entity25 ridiculed in her blog			1
' @entity154 and @entity155 , they have friends whose parents are same - sex couples , ' he said on wednesday			1
historic : president @entity12 is the first sitting @entity93 president to publicly support gay marriage			1
president @entity162 opposed it and president @entity164 signed the @entity165 into law ' there have been times where @entity169 and i have been sitting around the dinner table and we ’re talking about their friends and their parents and @entity154 and @entity155 , it would n’t dawn on them that somehow their friends ’ parents would be treated differently			1
' it does n’t make sense to them and frankly , that ’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective			0
' @entity25 objected : ' while it ’s great to listen to your kids ’ ideas , there ’s also a time when dads simply need to be dads			2
' it would ’ve been helpful for him to explain to @entity154 and @entity155 that while her friends parents are no doubt lovely people , that ’s not a reason to change thousands of years of thinking about marriage			1
' she continued : ' sometimes dads should lead their family in the right ways of thinking			0
it would ’ve been nice if the president would ’ve been an actual leader and helped shape their thoughts instead of merely reflecting what many teenagers think after one too many episodes of @entity211			0
' while @entity25 has been quick to criticise the president , many others have come out in support of his historic endorsement of same - sex marriage			2
@entity218 , who has been married to actress @entity219 for nearly four years , branded the move ' brave ' during a taping of her talk show			2
' there have been moments in history when someone has had the courage to stand up for what they believe in and that one action changes everything , i hope this is one of those times , ' she said			0
' it takes a brave man to take a stand like this , especially in an election year so to you mr president i say thank you very , very much			0
' other celebrities have applauded the move , including gay stars @entity244 and @entity246			1
during his speech , @entity12 claimed the change is a personal one only , and that he still believes the issue of gay marriage should be left up to the states to each decide			1
currently , six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it			0
it appears that the president is banking on the issue , which is heavily supported by younger @entity93 , to mobilize the youth vote , which has become disaffected during his term in office			0
@entity12 had long been suspected of supporting gay marriage , but was thought to be afraid to make it public because of the political backlash			1
but he had been under intense pressure to clarify his view toward gay marriage after vice president @entity11 publicly supported it on sunday			1
' i am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men , women marrying women and men and women marrying are entitled to the same exact rights , all the civil rights , all the civil liberties			0
family affair : @entity12 said his decision was swayed by his daughters @entity155 and @entity154 , who have friends with gay parents			1
@entity25 said he should not listen to his children but he should be a ' leader shaping their views ' ' and quite frankly , i do n’t see much of a distinction beyond that , ' @entity11 said on @entity289			0
1996 , running for @entity290 : ' i favor legalizing same - sex marriages , and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages			0
' 2004 , running for @entity294 in @entity295 : ' my religious faith dictates marriage is between a man and a woman , gay marriage is not a civil right			1
' 2008 , running for @entity93 president : ' i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman			0
as a @entity308 it 's also a sacred union			0
' 2010 , after @entity22 wave election : ' my feelings with this are constantly evolving , i struggle with this			0
' 2012 , running for reelection : ' i think same sex couples should be able to get married			0
' @entity12 has famously flip - flopped on the issues			0
since 2004 , he has opposed gay marriage , saying his beliefs were based on his @entity308 faith			1
he signaled that he was open to changing his opinion on gay marriage in 2010 when he said his feelings on the issues were ' evolving			1
' ' i struggle with this , ' he famously said			0
but , this is n't the first time @entity12 has changed in mind on the issue			2
in 1996 , as an @entity290 candidate , he told a gay newspaper in @entity329 that he was in favor of legalizing same - sex marriage and ' would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages			2
' now , he seems to be making an election - year political gamble by directly challenging @entity139 , his @entity22 opponent in november			0
before the president 's remarks today , @entity139 re-affirmed his opposition to gay marriage			1
' i do not favor marriage between people of the same gender and i do n't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name , ' he told @entity346 in @entity347			0
thanks : @entity218 , along with other celebrities , thanked @entity12 for the move , which she called ' brave ' last week , @entity139 's spokesman for foreign policy , @entity350 , quit the campaign after he came under fire from some conservatives for being openly gay			1
recent polls show 50 percent of @entity93 support gay marriage , but also reveal that the 45 percent who oppose it have strong convictions			2
just a day before @entity12 's announcement , voters in the key battleground state of @entity362 approved a strict new ban on same - sex marriage			2
the measure , which prohibits any civil or domestic benefits for gay couples , passed by a landslide with 61 percent of the vote			0
