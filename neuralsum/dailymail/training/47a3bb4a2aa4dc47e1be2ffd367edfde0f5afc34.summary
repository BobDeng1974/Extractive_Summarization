powerful lights confiscated by police during marijuana raids are now being used by the groundsman of @entity5 club @entity4 to help grass grow on its pitch			1

@entity12 bolted together two old goalposts , attached the lights and placed the rig over damaged areas of the playing field , such as the goalmouth			2
@entity12 poses in front of the new lights with a police officer after the expensive equipment was donated @entity12 says ' we would n't be able to buy the rigs that @entity28 clubs have because of the cost - the small ones cost Â£ 30,000			1
' detective inspector @entity31 told the @entity32 : ' i think it 's a great idea - it 's helping to grow the right kind of grass			0
' it 's criminal property that would have ordinarily been destroyed , but now it can help the local community free of charge and prevents it from being dumped in a landfill			0
' @entity12 is using the lights to help regrow areas of the pitch which are worse for wear , such as the goalmouth			0

police had taken the lights from criminals using them to grow cannabis
@entity4 groundsman @entity12 is now using them on the goalmouth
