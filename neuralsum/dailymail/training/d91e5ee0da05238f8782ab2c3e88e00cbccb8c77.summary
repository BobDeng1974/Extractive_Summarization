by @entity0 , @entity1 veteran skipper @entity2 has warned @entity3 they face their toughest challenge yet as they attempt to book their place in the second round of the @entity10 finals			1
the 35 - year - old former @entity13 defender 's claim may raise eyebrows given that @entity15 , following a narrow victory over @entity17 , have already encountered hosts @entity18 and emerged with a 0 - 0 draw which has left qualification firmly in their own hands			1
but as they prepare for their @entity26 showdown with @entity27 in @entity28 on monday , @entity2 insists they can leave nothing to chance			1
we know we have to keep the momentum going			2
' we worked so hard in our last two games and we do n't want to throw it all away against @entity27			1
' we have always known we were going to face tough opponents			2
@entity27 have loads of very talented players			1
' they have got very quick wingers who can get to the byline and put the ball in the box			0
they have also got a lethal striker and some of the best central midfielders around			0
' they are a great team , so it wo n't be easy			2
we will have to give our best to get at least a point and move on to the next phase			0
' the equation is simple for the @entity67 : avoid defeat and they will progress to face either @entity70 or @entity71 in the next phase of the competition			2
however , defeat would see the @entity75 leapfrog them and that , coupled with anything other than a heavy reverse for @entity18 at the hands of pointless @entity17 , would send them home			1
talent : @entity3 will be facing off against the likes of @entity83 and @entity84 style : @entity27 boss @entity86 has promised that his side will take the game to the @entity67 @entity89 and @entity3 set for decider @entity2 , leading his country for the fourth time at the @entity10 finals , said : ' if you take a look at the quality of the teams we have faced , it shows how difficult and tough a task we have had			1
' and though we are not there yet , we are close to taking an important step			0
keeping clean sheets has been key for us , and we are determined to keep that going			0
' @entity27 boss @entity86 will head into the game knowing victory represents his side 's only realistic chance of making it to the knockout stage with @entity18 and @entity3 both currently a point better @entity112 , he will not take immediate risks in his pursuit of a priceless win			1
@entity86 told the @entity118 's official website , www.hns-cff.hr : ' i know what we need , but we have 90 minutes			0
' from the first minute , we will try to impose our rhythm because we make it easier for the early goal			0
but we will be patient			0
' i think we have quality and we have enough players to trouble @entity67 defence , and as much as we look at them , so they will have to watch us			0

@entity2 warns his team - mates that @entity27 game will be their toughest yet
