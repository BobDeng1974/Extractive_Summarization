the @entity55 said @entity190 is a high - risk area for transmission for that reason , recipients need to be good experimental subjects - people who have recently contracted the disease and are more likely to respond to treatment or perhaps younger patients , he said			2
in order to study the long - term effects , doctors will likely prefer people who can be observed for months , which might eliminate those living in remote places , he added			2
@entity53 announced yesterday that another person had died from @entity2 , bringing the country 's death toll to four			2
the @entity214 said the person was a nurse who helped treat the country 's first @entity2 case , @entity3 - @entity115 @entity218 who flew in last month and died			1
