as he walked through the tunnel en route to the first tee @entity0 gave a fist bump to the mural that showed @entity6 striking a similar pose			1
after hitting a miraculous shot out of the bushes on the 13th to within two feet of the flag the 34 - year - old @entity11 turned to the accompanying camera and remarked ‘ a bit of @entity6 for ya ! ’ these evocations of the great @entity16 might have been out of character for a normally undemonstrative man but @entity20 ’s performances over the past three days seemed to be infused by the spirit of @entity6 , a man so famously enthused by the @entity22			1
@entity0 was @entity23 's mvp over the weekend , picking up four points from five matches @entity26 highlights by the end of it all last year ’s @entity28 champion had contributed almost 25 per cent of @entity23 ’s points to become , in the phraseology of their opponents , the mvp : most valuable player of the event			1
on the final day others made more eyecatching contributions than the hard - earned half he managed against @entity41 , who he finally clawed back having gone four down after the sixth			1
that he outmatched the @entity45 ’s seven birdies with eight of his own told of the quality of the match			2
later he acknowledged the debt owed to @entity6 but also cited as an inspiration the more unlikely figure of @entity52 ’s @entity51 , who played on the team in @entity54			1
@entity20 kisses the trophy he worked so hard to help win , with @entity23 captain @entity57 watching on @entity20 said he was inspired by @entity51 who fought hard on the final day of the singles in 2012 ‘ on the front nine i was basically trying to be @entity51 , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ he was six down to @entity60 on the sunday two years ago but ended up taking him all the way up the 18th			2
‘ that sent an important message to the rest of the team that day , that we were still in there fighting , and i wanted to send the same message			2
’ the mild - mannered @entity20 does not have the flamboyance of @entity6 or the in - your - face quality of @entity73 but this team format sees him transformed into fist - pumper in chief , and he is quietly assembling a @entity22 record to stand with any of them			1
today it reads nine wins , two halves and three losses after his four points that will go down as one of the finest @entity23 performances in the competition over the past 30 years			1
@entity51 ( right ) and @entity20 ( second right ) celebrate in @entity54 after the remarkable comeback win the @entity11 produced one of the finest displays by a @entity23 , complete with uncharacteristic emotions had he not been paired with @entity92 on saturday afternoon , or @entity41 not been so impressive yesterday , then his tally might have been of more historic proportions			1
his high - water mark came on saturday morning when , in completing three wins out of three with @entity97 , he was sinking putts with the ease of a man placing litter in the bin			0
he could have been excused feeling weary yesterday , especially going so far behind , but instead responded with a run of five straight birdies			0
and then there was the amazing save at the 13th , which was where @entity6 especially came in			0
‘ when i walked up to my ball it was in the gorse bush and i thought , “ i ’m dead here ” , and all i could do was try to punch out an eight - iron			0
' @entity6 was at his best when he was trying to make something out nothing , i ’ve been watching footage of him doing that my whole life so that ’s why i thought of him			0
@entity20 channeled the spirit of @entity6 when playing from difficult positions as he led @entity23 to glory ‘ it just felt so @entity22 , and how he used to battle away and never give up			1
he is still fresh in our memory and has a big impact on us			0
here his was the last image you would see before walking onto the first tee , and we had a big picture of him in our team room as well			0
’ what eternally fascinates about a competition that wraps up an essentially individual pursuit into a team format is that it can make some grow beyond their stature and diminish others			0
while @entity20 ’s collegiate temperament makes him a natural fit , there were fears beforehand that the more introverted @entity143 might struggle with all that it entails			1
yet @entity143 emerged with two - and - a - half points from three , and looked like he and @entity146 had been playing together since childhood			2
others , such as @entity149 and @entity150 , showed that veering from their norm of merely looking after their own games is not conducive to producing their best			0
@entity154 found the experience overwhelming on the front nine of his first outing , although he fared better yesterday and was unlucky to be drawn against a determined @entity157			0
@entity150 looks glum after the world no 2 lost all three of his matches at @entity160 @entity149 has still never won a match at the @entity22 after losing heavily to @entity162 @entity149 has now played for eight points in the @entity22 and failed to win any of them , becoming only the fifth man in the last 10 editions not to register a full point from five matches , although he did manage three halves			2
@entity150 is a more striking example , and in going 0 - 3 at @entity160 has now lost eight of his 11 matches , despite having won two of the last three masters			0
‘ i guess i ’m too nice , ’ he said			0
that was once the label attached to the charming @entity20 , although it is now well and truly defunct .			2

@entity0 fought back from behind to pick up vital half point on sunday
@entity20 was @entity23 's ' mvp ' in a *superb* display over all three days
@entity11 paid tribute to @entity51 , who came back from six holes down in 2012 to give @entity23 hope
