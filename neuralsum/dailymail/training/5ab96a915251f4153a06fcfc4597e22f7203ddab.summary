@entity0 today promised to fight @entity1 ' on the beaches of @entity3 ' in the bitter fight to stop the @entity6 party securing its first seat in the @entity8			1
but the @entity10 mayor does not seem to have gone to the trouble of learning the name of the @entity14 candidate - former sitcom actor @entity13 - who has been tasked with stopping the @entity1 bandwagon in its tracks			1
quizzed on the radio about the @entity14 ' chances in this week 's by - election , mr @entity0 could only venture that the candidate was a ' superb man ... @entity21 ? @entity22 ? something like that			1
it would be the first time @entity1 has secured an elected seat in the @entity8 , with leader @entity35 hoping to use it as a springboard to more seats in the run - up to the 2015 general election			1
promising to ' fight them on the beaches of @entity3 ' , mr @entity0 played down the impact of a @entity1 win , which would see the party secure its first elected mp			1
it would be a ' small earthquake in @entity49 ' , he said on @entity50 , adding : ' it wo n't necessarily change the price of fish			0
' it will be , obviously , a disappointment if we do n't win for the @entity14 , but we will fight again and there 's always a general election to contest it again			1
' but mr @entity0 was left struggling when presenter @entity58 asked who the @entity14 candidate was			1
' we 've got a fantastic guy called ... superb man ... @entity21 , @entity62 , something like that , ' he said			0
he could not even complete mr @entity13 's name when prompted that he was called @entity13 and he had been in the 1980s sitcom bread			2
the mayor , who is set to return to @entity68 at the general election , warned that votes for @entity1 in may 2015 could result in a @entity72 government			2
' no matter how strong @entity1 is performing in some parts of the country , there is absolutely no way on earth they are going to get more than one seat or something like that at the general election , ' he said			2
' indeed , i think it quite likely at the general election that they will be wiped out , so that any gains they make in the current crop of by - elections - and i suppose it is conceivable they might win something - they will lose			2
' all they can do is take votes away from the only party , which is the @entity14 , who are actually going to deliver a referendum			0
' home secretary @entity97 campaigned in @entity3 today with @entity14 candidate @entity13 , a local councillor who used to be an actor in 1980s sitcom bread the by - election was triggered when @entity14 mp @entity29 ( pictured today ) , defected to @entity1 in august @entity1 leader @entity35 hopes to secure his first elected mp in the @entity8 in @entity3 surprisingly , mr @entity0 went on to say he agreed with mr @entity35 on several issues , but stressed only the @entity104 could win the general election			1
he added : ' the problem is you vote @entity35 , you get @entity108			0
in many ways there are things that i agree with that @entity35 says			0
he seems to have ... the right approach to many issues			0
' mr @entity0 said a ' pretty big item of agreement ' with mr @entity35 was on the need for a referendum on @entity121 membership			0
he added that mr @entity35 is a ' low tax sort of guy and he is a small state sort of guy and that also appeals to me '			0
but mr @entity0 added : ' he , alas , for all the slightly interesting things that he may be saying from time to time , he is n't going to deliver the goods and all he will do is stop the @entity14 from being in a position to do that			0
