the shocking decline of young @entity2 players in the @entity3 is revealed by new research published by @entity5 which shows that the academies of the @entity3 ’s current 20 clubs have produced just 57 first - team regulars over the past 10 years			1
in the week in which @entity11 chairman @entity10 attempted to persuade @entity3 clubs to increase the quota of home - grown players in their squad from eight to twelve , the new figures show that the nation ’s elite clubs are producing fewer than three players per club on average over a decade with the league ’s biggest clubs having some of the worst records			1
@entity26 have produced no home - grown first - team regulars since @entity29 emerged at the start of the millennium			1
@entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 have had less than a handful each			1
regular is defined as playing half or more of league games in a season			0
scroll down to see a graphic showing how many home - grown first - team regulars your favourite club has had over the past decade @entity3 leaders @entity26 have produced no home - grown first - team regulars since @entity29 emerged at the start of the millennium the issue is becoming a major battleground between @entity11 chairman @entity10 , who wants to introduce measures to increase opportunities for home - grown talent , and the @entity3 clubs , who do n’t want quotas forced upon them			1
the new research on home - grown regulars produced in the past decade shows that only @entity62 and @entity63 , with seven such players each , and @entity65 , with five , had produced five or more since the start of the 2005 - 06 season			1
the @entity62 players who meet the criteria are @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
@entity70 is one of an abundance of players that have made a name for themselves after coming through the ranks at @entity62 @entity71 came through the ranks at @entity62 before becoming a star at @entity82 and @entity83 giants @entity84 @entity87 duo @entity86 and @entity88 came through the ranks at @entity90 , as did defender @entity91 five of them have been capped by @entity94 , and @entity71 , the world ’s most expensive footballer , by @entity96 , while @entity74 , 20 in november , has 28 @entity94 appearances below senior level			0
but given that @entity3 clubs have spent around £ 600 million combined on their academies in the last decade alone , or about £ 3m per club per year on average , the number of players most have produced for their first teams is pitiful			2
the new research considers how many players the current 20 @entity3 clubs have nurtured between the ages of 15 - 18 who have then gone on to be ‘ regulars ’ for that team			1
@entity62 ’s academy has produced more players in the decade than the seven mentioned but not who have yet become regulars as defined			0
on the same basis , @entity26 ’s tally is zero , @entity32 ’s is just two , in @entity119 and @entity120			2
@entity34 and @entity33 have produced just three each , respectively @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , and @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			2
@entity126 and @entity125 did the business in the youth squads before becoming regulars in @entity34 's first team @entity122 is one of three youngsters to excel since coming through the @entity33 ranks along with @entity123 and @entity121 @entity132 and @entity133 impressed in the youth set - up before moving through to the @entity35 first team @entity35 ’s four such players were @entity137 , @entity133 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
all the relevant ‘ products ’ of the 20 clubs over the decade are in the accompanying panel			0
@entity10 has started negotiations with the @entity3 clubs to seek a minimum of 12 home - grown players per first - team squad of 25 by 2020 , phased in from 2016 onwards			1
he wants the definition of ‘ home - grown ’ to be players registered with a club for three years before the age of 18			1
@entity10 ’s aim is to expand the talent pool of @entity2 players with good amounts of high - level competitive exposure			2
@entity26 in many ways exemplify the core problem : they have more age - group @entity94 players below the senior team than anyone , and some truly outstanding youngsters			2
but those players for now are struggling to become first - team players let alone regulars at @entity170			2
managers like @entity172 are charged with winning by their employers , not helping @entity94			0
and many fans would probably agree that is something they support			0
@entity10 created the an @entity177 in 2013 to explore the reasons for the low number of @entity2 players in the @entity3 and suggest solutions to address the issue - with the stated aim of helping to improve the @entity94 team			1
the number of @entity2 players in the @entity3 has fallen as low as 32 per cent in recent years			0
@entity10 wants that boosted to 45 per cent by 2022			0
a @entity177 report last year highlighted how there is a particular ‘ bottleneck ’ for @entity2 players aged 18 to 21 , limiting first - team opportunities at @entity3 clubs			1
many clubs prefer to use tried and tested - and often foreign - players instead of their own home - growns			2
the alarming extent to which that is true is highlighted here			0
minutes played by @entity2 players aged under 21 in the @entity3 have fallen by more than half in 10 years , and @entity197 in the @entity198 are a relatively rarity despite @entity94 have joint-most teams competing each season			1
@entity10 has started negotiations with @entity3 clubs to seek a minimum of 12 home - grown players per first - team squad @entity82 striker @entity206 has excelled in north @entity207 since bursting on to the scene and even earned an @entity94 call - up former @entity94 manager @entity210 , a member of @entity10 ’s commission , believes that clubs should back his proposals , citing @entity206 as an example			1
‘ you sense there is reluctance over @entity10 ’s suggestion we increase the number of homegrown players , ’ he said			2
‘ we will never know if our players are good enough unless they get the chance			0
talent is n’t always as obvious as @entity125 or @entity225			0
‘ sometimes , as with @entity206 , it takes time to develop and that only comes with games			0
‘ a year ago some at @entity82 would have questioned whether he was @entity198 quality			0
they do n’t now , but only because he was lucky to have managers willing to play him			0

@entity3 ’s current 20 clubs have produced just 57 first - team regulars over the past 10 years
@entity26 have produced no home - grown first - team regulars since @entity29 emerged at the start of the millennium
@entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 have had less than a handful of homegrown stars each
@entity10 is attempting to persuade clubs to increase home - grown players squad quota from eight to twelve
