a surge in testosterone in newborn boys just hours after birth could be the solution to the age - old mystery that is the difference between the male and female brains			1
called the @entity10 protein by researchers , the surge only affects the male brain , a new study by the @entity14 has found			1
the study published in the @entity16 observed a small group of neurons linked to fertility are only active in male newborn mice , and not females			0
@entity22 - where the ' @entity10 ' in the name originated - is a small protein which stimulates a certain type of neurons , a process that researchers found only occurred in males			0
new research suggests a release of testosterone shortly after baby boys are born could account for the differences between the male and female brains these neurons are gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( @entity35 ) , and are cells that control the release of reproductive hormones from the brain 's pituitary gland			1
the molecule was originally named after the @entity10 chocolate by @entity44 cancer researchers based in @entity10 , @entity45 , who at the time were unaware of its role in fertility			0
the @entity51 study also found that when kisspeptin binds to specific nerves it kick - starts a brief but powerful testosterone surge in male babies within five hours of birth , causing their brains to develop differently from females right form the get - go			2
this could have implications on the neurological disorders from which men and women suffer			2
called @entity10 , the protein could also shed light on the neurological disorders from which men and women suffer the study 's leader @entity68 said the findings highlight the role kisspeptin can play in controlling fertility			1
' not only does kisspeptin signalling act as a master switch for puberty and ovulation , we now show how in the first hours of drawing breath it also triggers our brains to develop differently according to our sex , ' he said			0
the study was carried out by @entity84 with @entity85 from the @entity86 in collaboration with researchers in @entity89 and @entity90 .			0

a new study has found a surge of testosterone released into newborn baby boys ' brains
named @entity10 , the protein is not *evident* in the female brain
this discovery could play a role in *understanding* neurological *diseases* men and women suffer from
