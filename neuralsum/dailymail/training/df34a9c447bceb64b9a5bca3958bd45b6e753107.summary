innocent : @entity6 , pictured here aged three , grew up in what she believed to be a tight - knit family , so as a child there appeared nothing wrong with her spending time with her ' loving ' uncle but his actions soon turned sinister , as he encouraged @entity6 to spend more time with him			1
she said : ' the first time i remember anything happening was when i was putting food into the fish tank			0
he sat on a chair behind me and put his legs around me , and then he started touching me			0
' i was naive , i did n't know what sex was			0
it did n't occur to me what he was doing to me was wrong and i believed that he loved me			0
' @entity13 said we would both get into trouble but especially me , so i did n't say a word			1
i had sex with him too many times			0

my mum said she was dirty			0
i then realised what was happening to me was wrong as well			0
' unloved : as a teenager , @entity6 says she was put into care and even called a ' reject ' by her mother as a teenager , @entity6 , who has an older brother and sister , was put into care and even called a ' reject ' by her mother			1

@entity6 said : ' two girls came forward and told police what he had done to them			1
' those little children that have spoken out deserve a medal for being so brave , and so do their parents for supporting them and believing them			0
' i ca n't apologise enough to the other parents because it should n't have happened			2
' passing sentence , judge @entity139 told @entity13 : ' it can not be said that at any stage of your life you led a blameless existence			2

it was the closest i had been to him in a long time			2
' i felt relieved to see him sentenced			0
i ca n't believe it 's finally over			0
i 've waited so long for justice			2
' but while i know he is being punished , it will always hurt that i was disbelieved by my family about it for so long			1
' detective constable @entity160 , of the @entity163 policing division 's public protection unit said : ' @entity13 is a predatory and dangerous man whose offending spanned decades			2
' his offending has not only had significant health implications for his victim but they will now have to live with this for the rest of their lives			0
