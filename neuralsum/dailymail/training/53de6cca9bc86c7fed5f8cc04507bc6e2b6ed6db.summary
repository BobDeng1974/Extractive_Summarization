by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:52 est , 21 october 2012 updated : 05:29 est , 23 october 2012 split : @entity3 resigned last week after a month of controversy the prime minister was forced to defend his handling of the @entity3 affair yesterday , insisting the former chief whip ’s rant at @entity11 police was not serious enough to cost him his job			1
the prime minister said mr @entity3 finally resigned because of the ‘ bigger question ’ of whether he would be able to do his job properly , having had his authority over mps undermined			1
mr @entity17 – widely criticised for allowing the issue to drag on for a month – appeared irritated as he was questioned over his refusal to sack the minister in a series of tv interviews yesterday			2
mr @entity3 has denied police claims he called officers ‘ plebs ’ and ‘ morons ’ after they asked him to use a side entrance to @entity26 , rather than opening the main gate for him and his bicycle			1
but he admitted swearing during the altercation and finally quit on friday night after senior colleagues told him and the prime minister he could not continue			2
mr @entity17 , speaking on @entity36 ’s @entity35 programme last night , said : ‘ the decision i had to make right at the beginning was : was it right for him to apologise and did the police accept that apology and therefore could he get on and do his job ? i took that decision			2
some people would criticise that and say , “ why not just sack him straight away ? ” i do n’t think that would have been the right thing to do			2
but obviously we found after a period of time he could n’t do his job so he had to resign			0
’ he added : ‘ i think as @entity33 you ’ve got to ... if someone has apologised you need to give them a chance to do their job			0
i tried , whether it was @entity57 ’s resignation , i tried ... rather than just do the easy thing quick at the lobby meeting at 11 o’clock meeting and have the person out the door which @entity63 sometimes did			2
’ ‘ it 's the easiest thing in the world as prime minister to just sack someone at the drop of a hat when something goes wrong			1
i thought the right thing to do was to make sure there was a proper apology , ’ he said			2
‘ the police did n't want to take it further but it did become apparent he was n't going to be able to do his job so the right conclusion was reached			0
‘ it takes longer to discover whether someone can or ca n't do their job			0
it 's much easier just to fire people , i actually think that is not the right approach			0
’ yesterday education secretary @entity83 revealed mr @entity17 did not believe mr @entity3 should have lost his job because of ‘ seven seconds of madness ’ in @entity11			1
the revelation raised fresh questions about mr @entity17 ’s judgment among @entity89 mps – who are still reeling from mr @entity3 ’s dramatic resignation after four weeks of controversy about his foul - mouthed rant at police officers			1
@entity95 , @entity96 's shadow cabinet office minister , claimed the @entity33 had not learned any lessons from ' this shambles '			0
he added : ' while everyone else can see how wrong @entity3 was , the prime minister is still completely out of touch			1
@entity17 should stop trying to blame other people for his own weakness and dithering - and start taking some responsibility			0
' mr @entity83 risked reopening the row with the @entity106 , by suggesting that the officers ’ recollection of former chief whip mr @entity3 ’s rant may have been wrong			1
he said : ‘ there ’s a @entity112 film , i think it ’s called @entity113 , in which different participants who see the same event all have different recollections of it			0
i trust @entity3 , and i ’m always inclined to give him the benefit of any doubt			2
’ one @entity89 mp said yesterday he was ‘ staggered ’ that mr @entity3 had not been sacked as soon as news broke of his confrontation			1
another said the prime minister had been ‘ misguided ’ , while a third accused him of presiding over a ‘ catastrophe ’ that would do lasting damage to the party ’s image			1
in a further blow , former @entity89 chairman @entity134 accused mr @entity17 of leading a ‘ dog of a coalition government ’ that had let itself be portrayed as ‘ a government of unfeeling toffs ’			0
mr @entity3 finally quit the @entity140 on friday night , saying he had lost the backing of the parliamentary party			2
mrs may made no attempt to deny her role yesterday , telling the @entity156 : ‘ i ’m not going to talk about private conversations			0
i think that is an end to the issue			0
’ accepting mr @entity3 ’s resignation on friday , mr @entity17 hinted at a possible comeback			1
and mr @entity83 revealed that the prime minister still believed mr @entity3 should be in the @entity140			1
home secretary @entity147 told mr @entity3 he should resign he told @entity164 : ‘ @entity17 wanted to keep @entity3 , i wanted @entity3 to stay because i do n’t believe and the prime minister does n’t believe that 30 years of public service should be effaced at a stroke by seven seconds of unacceptable but very human exasperation			1
‘ but @entity3 came to that decision and he did so because he wanted to put the interests of the party collectively ahead of his own			0
’ mr @entity83 repeated the claim in a later interview , saying the prime minister had ‘ wanted him to stay on ’			1
he acknowledged that the row had overshadowed good news on the economy last week , but said the public would see through the ‘ froth ’ , noting that @entity63 had won three elections despite a string of scandals involving ministers in his government			0
mr @entity83 ’s comments came as backbenchers broke cover to voice their dismay at the prime minister ’s handling of recent events			1
@entity89 mp @entity192 said he had told his whip as soon as the original story broke that mr @entity3 ought to be removed because it would ‘ run and run and run ’			1
‘ i was frankly a bit staggered at the time that @entity11 had n’t picked up on the whole mess earlier , ’ he said			2
mr @entity192 added : ‘ a lot of the problems we are facing at the moment are not problems about the economy but actually it ’s stuff we have made ourselves			0
the disasters or shambles that are created wholly within @entity207 or within @entity11			0
’ @entity208 , secretary of the @entity209 , described mr @entity17 ’s decision to bring back @entity212 sir @entity211 to replace mr @entity3 as a ‘ comfort - zone appointment ’			1
he added : ‘ i ’m afraid it points to very poor man - management – @entity17 is the sort of guy who wants people around him who is comfortable with rather than people who will challenge him			0
’ mp @entity221 said mr @entity17 had been ‘ misguided ’ to hang on to mr @entity3 , adding : ‘ it was handled badly			1
@entity3 should have resigned , i think when he did n’t resign the prime minister should have sacked him			2
’ in an article for the observer , @entity134 wrote : ‘ this dog of a coalition government has let itself be given a bad name and now anybody can beat it			0
‘ it has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs			0
past governments have had far more real @entity89 toffs : prime ministers @entity236 and @entity238 , or even in @entity239 ’s day , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 and plenty more , without incurring similar abuse			0

the prime minister says it would have been ' easy ' to sack his minister but the ' proper thing to do ' was get him to say sorry
education secretary @entity83 suggested he and the *pm* had tried to *persuade* mr @entity3 to ' tough it out '
mr @entity3 ’s dramatic resignation was *due* to foul - mouthed rant at police officers as he tried to exit the @entity11 gates on his bike
mr @entity83 suggested the officers ’ recollection of rant may have been wrong
