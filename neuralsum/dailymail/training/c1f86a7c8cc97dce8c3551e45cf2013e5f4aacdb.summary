by @entity0 published : 02:36 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 27 august 2013 the number of people renting homes has soared by a staggering 89 per cent in 10 years as householders struggle to get on the housing ladder , new data has revealed			1
figures show a dramatic rise in the number of tenants in @entity11 and @entity12 , from 1.9million households in 2001 to 3.6million in 2011			1
the rise has lead to a surge in the number of ' rental hotspots ' emerging across the country			2
in 2001 there were just eight ' hotspot ' areas in @entity11 and @entity12 that had between 20 and 40 per cent of homes rented out , but by 2011 this had climbed to 51 areas			2
rental surge : the flooding of colour across the 2011 map shows how widespread this new market has become , with large numbers of people renting in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 changing times : the rental picture looked dramatically different in 2001 with large swatches of people in @entity12 , @entity40 and @entity41 and parts of the @entity44 renting properties ten years ago experts say the phenomenon - dubbed ' @entity46 ' - is down to the battle many face to raise enough money for a house deposit , and the older generation being forced to release capital from their own homes to pay for their care in later life			1
traditionally , @entity32 has always been the area where large numbers of people choose to rent , due to the spiraling cost of buying			2
however the new data shows that in the past decade this has expanded to include large pockets of the @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity44			0
now only a few small areas of the country have little or no properties lived in by tenants			0
seaside town : @entity70 ( pictured ) is the top rental hotspot outside of @entity32			1
more people are renting for longer as they struggle to raise a deposit meaning the rental market has changed dramatically in just 10 years hotspot : many of the renting hotspots tend to be university cities or major business hubs , but more unusual hotspots include @entity80 , ( pictured ) @entity81 and @entity82 where landlords are cashing in many of the hotspots tend to be university cities or major business hubs , but more unusual hotspots include @entity85 in @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
others include @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 in the @entity90 , @entity34 and @entity35 in the @entity91 and @entity92 and @entity93 in the @entity64			0
@entity99 the @entity64 is also popular with many seaside towns seeing rising numbers of rental properties			2
ten years ago , the picture was radically different and rental hotspots were centred on large parts of @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity32 and the west of @entity12			1
housing experts believe that although home - ownership will remain constant , more people will have to rent for longer as it becomes increasingly difficult to raise a deposit			0
@entity112 , @entity113 said : ' the private rental sector has changed dramatically over the past decade , and although this brings us more in line with our northern @entity118 peers we are still some way off the scale of the rental sector in countries like @entity123 and @entity124			0
' in our view it is likely that overall home ownership will remain between 60 and 70 per cent over people â€™s lifetimes , but we will see much more openness to rental at different life stages and for longer time periods			0
' she added : ' it is widely acknowledged that long - term rental is increasingly common , driven by factors such as whether the younger generation are able to raise deposits to buy , or indeed the older generation releasing capital from their homes for care and pensions			0
capital bubble : there are a significant number of @entity32 boroughs where the rental increase has been dramatic with @entity151 and @entity152 seeing an increase of 230 per cent in 10 years ' the varied growth of this market across the @entity156 clearly points to a need to understand local markets rather than just the big picture			1
' within @entity32 , a number of boroughs have seen an increase in the number of rented properties , such as @entity151 and @entity152 , which has seen an increase of 230 per cent in 10 years , and @entity166 , which has seen a rise of more than 150 per cent			1
traditionally established areas in prime central @entity32 such as @entity169 and @entity170 as well as @entity171 and @entity172 have also seen increases of between 30 and 60 per cent			0
ms @entity112 said : ' it is widely acknowledged that long - term renting is now immensely common for the younger generation and even more affluent older generations are exploring this different lifestyle option and seeing how much more they can get for their money in rental rather than committing to buying			0

numbers rose from 1.9million tenant households in 2001 to 3.6million in 2011
there are now 51 rental hotspots in @entity156 *compared* to eight 10 years ago
popular areas with tenants now include @entity85 , @entity82 and @entity190
@entity70 is the largest rental hotspot outside of @entity32
