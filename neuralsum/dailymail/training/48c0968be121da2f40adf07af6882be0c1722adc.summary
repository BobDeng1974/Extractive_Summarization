by @entity0 council bosses have ordered a town on @entity3 to take down home - knitted @entity6 bunting after claiming the weight of the wool was causing streetlights to bend			1
residents from @entity12 , in the @entity10 , spent months knitting more than 20,000 jerseys in the @entity6 's signature colours of yellow , green and white with red dots to hang between lamp - posts			1
but yesterday workers arrived from @entity18 to taken them down , because officials worried the metal poles were ' leaning ' under the weight of the wool after it got wet			1
council workers have forced residents in @entity25 , @entity3 , to take down bunting they knitted to celebrate the @entity6 after claiming it was bending the lamp - posts officials complained that the metal poles were ' leaning ' under the weight of the bunting after it got wet , so residents have been told to had it on buildings or trees instead tour de force : some of the impressive collection of 20,000 jerseys after they had to be removed from the route @entity42 , 45 , manager of @entity43 , said : ' it ’s health and safety gone bananas			1
' @entity48 do n’t fall over when they get wet			0
if the lamp posts are that flimsy and fragile they need looking at			2
' they have been there for years and we do n’t think a few jerseys - that weigh nothing - are going to make any difference			1
“ we have not seen any bending at all and we have had more than our share of rain			2
we did not want it to end up in a corner of some council building			2
' so we have taken the bunting back and it is hanging from guttering , windows , and the doorways and arches of houses without any problems			0
' you would think the council has better things to spend our money on			2
' @entity75 asked residents to knit woolen jerseys in november last year to hang around nearby villages as the tour passed through , and received entries from as far afield as @entity81 and @entity82			1
after the entries were collected , @entity12 was given 40 metres of the bunting to hang from half a dozen 20ft tall lamp posts in the market square			1
but @entity18 , who are charged with taking care of streetlights in the town , overruled them and demanded the decorations be taken down			0
a county council spokesman said : ' the council is fully supportive of putting up bunting to celebrate @entity3 ’s hosting of the @entity98 of the @entity6			1
sheepish : some of the bemused knitters in the @entity10 , where the bunting has had to be removed			0
@entity42 , 45 , manager of @entity43 , said : ' it 's health and safety gone bananas ' stockpiled : @entity12 was given 40 metres of the bunting to hang from half a dozen 20ft tall lamp posts ' indeed , the authority is distributing four kilometres of bunting to schools , council buildings and libraries along the @entity6 route to support the festivities for this fantastic event			1
' following @entity75 ’s erection of bunting in @entity12 we noticed that the lighting columns were leaning and in the interest of safety we asked the council to take them down as a matter of some urgency			1
' we welcome bunting on buildings , or between trees , but it can not be hung between lampposts for the safety reasons			2
' @entity128 , of @entity129 , said : ' the @entity6 visiting the @entity130 is an opportunity for us to show our community spirit at its best			1
' yet again it appears that a local council is ignoring the excitement of local residents in favour of an over-zealous approach to health and safety			1
' the fact that local residents have taken the time to create home - made bunting in order to decorate their town and welcome the @entity6 should have been celebrated by the council , not criticised			1
' local residents want their town to look its best , given it will have the world ’s attention on it			0
it ’s such a shame the council has chosen to act in such a nonsensical way			0
' the @entity6 begins in @entity152 on 5 july with the first stage travelling to @entity75 via the @entity10 and a second stage on the 6 july from @entity155 to @entity156			2
the @entity6 will begin in @entity152 on july 5 this year before travelling to @entity75 via the @entity10 , where it will pass through @entity12 ( pictured , @entity157 wears the race 's signature yellow jersey ) bonkers : a primary school in @entity162 told pupils that they needed to wear goggles if they wanted to play with conkers other cases of bizarre health and safety policies include a local council in @entity170 which banned a dog training club over allergy fears			1
the club , which had been running in a community hall for 60 years , was banned because the council claimed that those using the hall next door might be allergic to dogs or catch a disease from the pets			0
in june last year , a mother in @entity183 was told by the headteacher that her seven - year - old daughter was no longer allowed to wear her homemade frilly socks because they could become a tripping hazard			0
meanwhile in @entity191 , small wooden canes protecting daffodil bans were pulled out of the ground in case someone tripped over them and fell into a flowerbed			0
a primary school in @entity162 told pupils that they needed to wear goggles - if they wanted to play with conkers at school			0
the rule came after the local council attempted to ban children from playing conkers in the playground			0
in 2012 , a @entity207 was not allowed to ride his float in @entity209 - despite the tradition being around for decades			0
the ban was imposed after health and safety assessments found the sleigh too dangerous , instead @entity215 had to walk alongside his sleigh in 2008 , children were banned from taking part in a sack race in @entity221 because teachers feared they would hurt themselves			0
instead pupils was asked to run or skip			0
a town council near @entity225 created a policy preventing loose flowers and pots being placed on graves .			2

residents in @entity12 , @entity3 , spent months knitting wooly jerseys
created to celebrate @entity6 passing through village next month
hand - sized creations were hung between lamp - post in market square
but council took them down saying weight was bending the metal poles
