what is it about lacy lingerie that lures celebrities into thinking they can become fashion experts overnight ? from @entity7 for @entity8 , to @entity9 for @entity10 , scores of famous faces are adding ‘ lingerie designer ’ to their cvs — despite little or no prior knowledge of the rag trade			1
but are their designs any good ? we asked fabric expert @entity18 , who has worked as a technologist for @entity8 and model @entity19 , who wears size 10 knickers and a @entity24 bra , to blind - test some celeb smalls			1
simply made , well - finished and the fabric feels soft			2
this would be impractical for anyone over a size b cup as it would provide little support			2
6/10 @entity19 says : i love how chic and elegant it looks			1
i would never guess this was @entity40 ’s design — surely it should be luminous pink ? 8/10 14/20 @entity9 - 15/20 @entity9 long line bra , £ 16.99 , and @entity45 briefs , £ 7.99 , newlook.com @entity18 says : a well put - together set			1
the bra has wide mesh side - panelling with extra boning for support			2
the fabric ends appear to have been cut by hand , which is preferable as there ’s less material that could scratch			2
8/10 @entity19 says : the bottoms are ill - fitting and creased , but the bra is better			1
well - structured , it felt like scaffolding for my chest ! the cup padding is generous , which larger busts may not like			2
7/10 15/20 @entity62 floozie by @entity63			2
t - shirt bra , £ 16.50 , and briefs , £ 6.50 , debenhams.com @entity18 says : the underwire was a little rigid , so this might be uncomfortable			1
there was also a horribly messy join in the stitching on the briefs			0
5/10 @entity19 says : i ca n’t imagine anyone over 20 wearing this set , the frills on the knickers would annoy me and show through tight clothing			1
it fits well , though , and the cups were the perfect size and shape			0
7/10 12/20 @entity81 @entity82 , £ 42 , and briefs , £ 25 , @entity84 @entity18 says : good attention to detail			1
labels are the same colour as the fabric , and there ’s a well - fastened , antique - style cameo between the cups			0
a few messy threads and the lace looks a bit fragile			0
7/10 @entity19 says : turquoise and brown is unusual , but it feels sexy and wearable			1
it fits perfectly and gives the perfect amount of cleavage			0
9/10 16/20 @entity102 dusky glow bra , £ 75 , and briefs , £ 50 , triumph.com @entity18 says : the thick band on the knickers is insubstantial			1
after a few washes , it would sag			0
on the shoulder strap , they ’ve used similar elastic , but reinforced it			0
why did they forget about the briefs ? 5/10 @entity19 says : @entity114 on the bra , rather than underwire , held firm , as did the knicker elastic for the time being			1
the oversized briefs feel like a nappy and the giant bows would show through clothes			0
6/10 11/20 @entity124 @entity124 intimates contour bra , £ 38 , and briefs , £ 23 , @entity84 @entity18 says : this looks cheap			1
the bow ends on bra and briefs were uneven ( by 0.5 and 1.5cm respectively ) ; the underwire felt stiff ; the lace was scratchy , the label at the back was n’t attached tidily			0
black labels in light - coloured sets also shows little care for design			0
4/10 @entity19 says : @entity139 ! the bra cups were too small , meaning i spilt ungracefully over the top			1
the back strap dug in and the knickers felt scratchy			0
4/10 8/20 @entity7 - @entity146 @entity7 for autograph plunge bra , £ 25 , and knickers , £ 12.50 , marksandspencer.com @entity18 says : clearly the best of the lot , the fabric and finish is exceptional			1
no loose ends , beautifully soft , stretchy lace			0
the fabric has been treated to keep it supple , and flat - locked stitching on the knickers stops threads sticking out or rubbing			0
someone knows what they are doing			0
10/10 @entity19 says : i liked the romantic , neutral colour , and the bra had subtle seams and pleats that would n’t be visible underneath a t - shirt			2
but the pants were baggy and wrinkled unflatteringly — i ’d have to go down a size			0
