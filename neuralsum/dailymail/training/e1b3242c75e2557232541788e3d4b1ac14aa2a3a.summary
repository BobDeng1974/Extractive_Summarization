mutiny : labour leader @entity1 hastily rejected the @entity3 's plan for ‘ @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ’ labour leader @entity1 faced a mutiny from his own @entity8 last night after hastily rejecting @entity10 ’s scheme to introduce ‘ @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ’			1
he sparked a backlash by refusing to support plans to curb the rights of @entity15 mps along with the transfer of new powers north of the border			1
instead he called for an unwieldy ‘ constitutional convention ’ to consider changes in the wake of the historic independence referendum and which would not report back until the end of next year			1
labour sources said mr @entity1 was ‘ wary ’ of any plan to limit the right of @entity15 mps to vote on laws at @entity28 that only affect @entity5 and @entity29			1
aides fear it could neuter the ability of a future @entity34 government to pass laws on issues ranging from health and education to welfare and tax			0
mr @entity1 said he would not sign up to anything that could be ‘ used for narrow party political advantage ’			1
however , senior @entity8 last night warned it was untenable for the party to oppose the move while arguing for @entity15 to be given more powers			1
former minister @entity47 , a close ally of mr @entity1 , said that while it was right to look at other elements of devolution , it was ‘ inevitable ’ that there would have to be change at @entity28			1
‘ as the powers of the @entity59 increase , the role of @entity15 mps in determining @entity5 laws will inevitably diminish , ’ said the @entity54 mp			1
‘ if the aim is to ensure that laws affecting @entity5 alone have the consent of elected @entity5 representatives , there are many ways of doing so			0
’ former home secretary @entity66 said the current situation was ‘ unfair ’ , adding that the issue should have been addressed when @entity34 established the @entity59 in 1999			1
he said @entity34 ’s attempt to deal with the problem had been abandoned when voters rejected the dream of former deputy prime minister @entity73 to set up a regional assembly in the north east a decade ago			0
mr @entity66 said : ‘ that anomaly has been left outstanding since then			1
‘ my own view is that it is unfair that three of the nations can decide on exclusively their own basis on legislation applying only to them but the biggest nation ( @entity5 ) ca n’t			0
so it has to be addressed			0
he said : ‘ the promises to @entity15 ensure that the @entity96 will dominate may ’s general election			1
‘ voters will demand from all @entity5 candidates whether they support @entity5 home rule and if they support giving an additional £ 1,600 a year , for ever , for every person living in @entity15 , over and above what they will vote for their own constituents			1
the @entity15 grandee appointed to oversee devolution is chairman of an energy firm found guilty of ripping off up to one million customers			2
lord @entity110 of @entity111 joined @entity112 in 2005 and last year was at the helm when it was hit with a £ 10.5million fine for mis - selling policies			0
he has also been forced to defend frequent price hikes and the huge profits made by the company			0
his considerable personal wealth has allowed him to buy his own island , @entity120 , off the west coast of @entity15 and he also owns a vineyard in @entity123			2
the 70 - year - old married father - of - two grew up in a rough area of @entity126 but was a bursary student at @entity128 in the city			0
a chartered accountant , he has held senior positions with a series of major banks including the @entity134 , and was chosen as chairman of the @entity136 in @entity126 held earlier this year			2
‘ voters will demand ‘ yes ’ to the first question , and ‘ no ’ to the second			0
these are the answers i shall willingly give			0
’ former @entity34 mp @entity142 said : ‘ the case for an @entity5 @entity59 is compelling if not overwhelming			0
just tinkering around with a few extra powers , for so - called regional authorities and cities , will simply not do			2
’ mr @entity142 said there were numerous examples of ‘ unacceptable ’ measures being introduced in @entity5 with the support of @entity15			1
these included a doubling of road tolls on the @entity155 river crossing at @entity156 at the same time as charges were scrapped on the @entity158 on the @entity159			0
the @entity155 toll increase was pushed through by the then @entity34 transport secretary @entity161 , a @entity15 mp			1
however , mr @entity1 warned it would be wrong to rush into a new constitutional deal			1
the @entity34 leader said there needed to be a series of regional ‘ dialogues ’ covering every area of the @entity169 on how power could be dispersed from @entity28 – including in @entity5			2
a lengthy public consultation was needed because the matter would not be left to the ‘ @entity28 elite ’ , he added			0
among the issues mr @entity1 said should be considered are the case for a ‘ senate of the nations and regions ’			2
but @entity180 chairman @entity179 accused mr @entity1 of trying to fudge the issue for political advantage			2
better together ? @entity1 , pictured with @entity183 and no vote supporters , would not condemn plans to restrict the say of @entity15 mps in @entity5 affairs			1
instead his party hinted at powers for @entity5 regions he said yesterday : ‘ we need a new and fair settlement not just for @entity15 , but for every part of the @entity169			1
and we want to work on a cross-party basis to make that happen			0
‘ but @entity1 ’s proposal would kick this vital issue into the long grass			2
the @entity201 vote could mean a 2p - a - litre dip in fuel prices at the pumps , according to the @entity205			0
before the referendum result , uncertainty over the @entity208 ’s future led to a drop in the value of sterling			0
this resulted in a slight rise in the price of petrol and diesel for @entity169 consumers despite a fall in world oil prices , the motoring group said			0
but with the pound already rising following the no vote , the @entity205 is now confident of better fuel deals			0
its president , @entity225 , said : ‘ @entity15 ’s support for staying in the @entity208 boosted the pound ... [ it ] rose against the dollar to more than 1.65 at one point			1
‘ we believe that if the pound stabilises at these higher levels we should be seeing at least a 2p per litre reduction in pump prices , which will be great news for everyone north and south of the border			0
’ ‘ if he is serious about delivering on our joint commitment to publish draft legislation on devolving more powers to @entity15 by january , he must say whether he supports an equal settlement for @entity5 – @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws			1
’ mr @entity1 was also facing @entity34 criticism over the party ’s lacklustre campaign north of the border , which failed to catch light until former prime minister @entity249 appeared to take charge in the final weeks			2
more than a third of @entity34 voters are thought to have backed independence			0
one shadow minister said : ‘ the brutal truth is that @entity1 does not connect with our voters in @entity15			1
until @entity249 intervened we were losing them			0
’ the @entity34 leader has made 14 visits to @entity15 since march and has spent the final week of the campaign visiting different parts of the country			2
but his personal ratings in @entity15 have remained at around the same level as in @entity5 , despite very low levels of support for the @entity180 in most of @entity15			1
the @entity34 leader was forced to pull out of two scheduled appearances after he was shouted down during a walkabout in @entity269 earlier in the week			0
following chaotic scenes as he was mobbed during a visit to a shopping centre in the @entity15 capital , he claimed the campaign for independence had an ‘ ugly side ’ .			2

*opposition* skewered by @entity3 who hinted at shades of @entity281
instead @entity1 suggested a lengthy ' constitutional convention ' process
but he did not support @entity287 plans to limit @entity15 mps ' voting powers
