stranded : a pod of around 20 beluga whales were pictured during a life or death struggle to free themselves from a mudflat in @entity11 , south of @entity13 , @entity14 the whales face the ever - present threat of being stranded in the bay 's water due to its long and narrow shape , which means animals must move quickly to deeper water as soon as the tide turns			1

in june 1995 , about 190 whales stranded but none died			1
some strandings , however , are deadly			1
in august 2004 , five or six whales died when 46 stranded in the arm			1
about the same number are believed to have died in 1999 , when about 50 whales stranded			1

after the pilot lowered the plane from 1,000 feet to 500 feet to get a better look , @entity51 counted about 20 belugas on the mudflats at mid-channel just west of @entity77			0
low tide was at 6 p.m. and by this time , the tide was coming in			0
the white whales were wriggling about trying to get free , @entity51 said			2

none seemed distressed and no dead whales were seen			2
the most recent survey in 2011 counted 284 whales			0
the reasons for whale strandings are not fully understood , said @entity100 , beluga project leader for the @entity101 in @entity102			0
it is possible the whales find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time after chasing salmon or avoiding killer whales , he said			0
what scientists do know is that when belugas become stranded they tend to gather together in the mud and move around to create a small pool , where water coursing over their flukes and flippers helps keep them cool , he said			0
the whales this time likely were stuck for about four hours , @entity100 said			0
‘ they go up and down those arms of the inlet a couple of times a day with the tides , ’ he said			0
‘ every once in a while something happens			0
