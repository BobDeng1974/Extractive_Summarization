by @entity0 last updated at 1:00 pm on 30th november 2011 @entity1 today moved to reassure passengers that their airmiles and existing bookings were safe , but analysts fear the company 's bankruptcy filing may affect future plans			1
the stricken company sent a letter to its frequent flyers saying : ' we want to assure you that your aadvantage miles are secure '			2
it also re-asserted its intent to honor existing program awards and promised to honour tickets			0
in trouble : @entity1 and @entity21 's parent companies are filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection it comes as the new ceo admitted there will be tough times ahead , but vowed to turn the company around			1
' the path ahead will be tough ' , @entity28 told @entity31 's @entity30			1
' but it 's a well - trodden path and we will make the company successful			1
' analysts said passengers would not notice little difference in the short term			0
' i think everything 's cool , ' said @entity40 , head of deals website @entity41 ( bestfares.com ) and a long - time observer of the airline industry			2
' i have almost 300,000 miles with @entity46 , and there 's no sweat on my brow			0
' but the reorganisation of @entity1 and its parent company @entity52 could lead to a shakeup in prices , fewer flights and an altered flying experience , it was warned ( see @entity58 panel below )			1
the company yesterday filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in a desperate push to unload huge debt from years of rising fuel prices and labour costs			1
reshuffle : the third largest @entity46 airline also said its ceo @entity67 , left , will step down and be replaced by @entity28 , right - its current president the third - biggest airline in the @entity46 wants to reduce costs and its $ 30billion debt to stay competitive but insists the restructure will not affect flights			1
the move to bankruptcy protection is a crushing blow to an iconic brand and represents an alarming symbol of @entity46 ’s dying economy			2
jet fuel cost an average of $ 3 per gallon so far this year - a record according to government data that goes back to 1990			1
jet fuel is more expensive now than the average of $ 2.96 per gallon in 2008 , when oil rose above $ 147 per barrel for the first time			1
it has risen 56.4 per cent in the past five years			0
the average price of jet fuel was $ 1.92 per gallon in 2006			1
parent firm @entity52 - based in @entity89 , @entity90 - along with regional affiliate @entity91 , are filing voluntary bankruptcy petitions to reorganise			1
the third largest @entity46 airline also said its ceo @entity67 will step down and be replaced by @entity28 - currently the company 's president			1
@entity46 was the only major @entity46 airline that did n't file for bankruptcy protection after the 9/11 attacks on @entity97 and @entity98 the last major airline to file for bankruptcy protection was @entity101 in 2005			2
labour costs are a big headache for @entity46			0
it remains the only major airline that still must fund worker pensions			2
big business : the company listed assets of about $ 24.7 billion , liabilities of $ 29.55 billion and $ 4.1billion in cash at a court in @entity97 @entity46 says labour - contract rules force it to spend at least $ 600million more than other airlines			1
it has also struggled with rising jet fuel costs			1
@entity46 lost $ 162million in the third quarter and has lost money in 14 of the last 16 quarters			2
the company listed assets of about $ 24.7 billion , liabilities of $ 29.55 billion and $ 4.1billion in cash at a court in @entity97			1
‘ we plan to initiate further negotiations with all of our unions to reduce our labour costs to competitive levels , ’ mr @entity28 said			0
q : are my airmiles safe ? for now			0
airlines tend to protect their mileage programs throughout bankruptcy , airline analyst @entity40 said , because they make money selling miles to credit card issuers and even passengers trading in miles fill seats and spend money			2
but @entity142 airline expert @entity141 said that could change			0
' my hunch is that , when they come out of bankruptcy , they may make them more difficult to redeem , ' he said			2
' from what i understand , they can change this whenever they want			0
' q : will my current reservations be honoured ? booked flights are secure as @entity46 said it would operate its regular schedule and honor tickets and reservations			2
but @entity46 could reduce its number of flights			2
that could mean that not all routes would continue indefinitely			0
q : will prices go up or down ? @entity46 may cut prices to keep planes full , particularly in anticipation of a slow january and february , but those are typical sale periods for the airlines			2
but the longer - term impact of an airline bankruptcy is higher ticket prices , not lower ones			1
as @entity46 uses this reorganization to get rid of many big , pricey , old planes , it may also cut their routes			0
' with fewer planes in the sky and fewer seats , you may be forced to pay more , ' said mr @entity40			2
q : will flights be safe ? federal safety inspectors have stepped up their surveillance of @entity1 and @entity21 ( also owned by @entity52 ) , according to the @entity186			1
' the @entity186 acts swiftly to aggressively protect the safety of the traveling public any time an airline files for bankruptcy protection , ' said a spokesperson for the agency			2
but there 's no reason to believe that the bankruptcy filing of such a large airline would lead to safety problems			1
q : will the new @entity46 be better ? @entity46 passengers may notice positive and negative changes in their flights			2
as the company gives up its older planes , passengers can expect to see more bells and whistles on the new ones			0
q : what about the workers ? a : with @entity46 's 80,000 employees expected to lose some pensions and other benefits , mr @entity40 expects the company 's flight attendants to be crankier than usual			1
' those friendly skies will still need some improvement , ' he said			0
@entity52 's top rivals , @entity218 and @entity101 , which both used bankruptcy protection to slash costs , have since found merger partners			1
@entity101 bought @entity222 and @entity218 bought @entity223 to form @entity224			0
@entity52 has been in labour talks with its pilots for five years and a wave of retirements in october had prompted speculation it was nearing a bankruptcy filing			1
some analysts believed pilots chose to retire to lock in pension values that may now be in jeopardy as the company moves through bankruptcy court			1
long tradition : @entity1 was formed from a group of companies over a ten - year period and started trading on the stock exchange in 1939 ' they will have to go through the whole process that their peers have gone through , ' aviation analyst @entity242 told @entity247			0
firms use chapter 11 bankruptcy for gaining time to restructure so they can still stay in operation			0
this method allows firms to keep many of their assets as they try to become profitable again rather than going straight into liquidation			0
' it ’s painful but probably necessary			0
they have fallen behind what others have done			0
' @entity52 shares have fallen almost 80 per cent this year			1
for the 240,000 passengers who fly @entity1 each day , the airline 's bankruptcy filing should have little noticeable impact			1
@entity101 , @entity224 , @entity223 and @entity264 all went through @entity265			1
their planes still took off and landed and frequent flier miles were still earned and redeemed			0
the only risk is if the restructuring fails , the airline liquidates and ceases to fly			0
but travelers who bought tickets by credit card would be protected			0
' miles are safe , ' said @entity275 , co-founder of frequent flier site @entity276			0
days gone by : air hostesses are pictured in the 1960s wearing @entity1 uniforms from 1933 @entity46 was founded in 1930 from the combination of more than 80 smaller carriers and started trading on the stock exchange in 1939			0
half of its fleet flew for the military airline during @entity287 - and it introduced the first domestic scheduled @entity46 freight service in 1944			0
in 1953 it was the first airline to provide a nonstop trans - continental service			0
its holding company @entity52 was formed after a reorganisation in 1982			1
@entity46 is now the nation 's third - largest airline behind @entity224 and @entity101			0
it flies about 240,000 passengers per day , has around 78,000 employees and operates out of five major hubs in @entity97 , @entity298 , @entity299 - @entity89 , @entity300 and @entity301			0
but @entity52 has suffered losses of $ 162million in the third quarter and $ 2.7billion in the past year .			1

new ceo admits ' path will be tough ' but *pledges* to turn company around
but @entity265 filing could lead to shake - up in prices and fewer flights further down the line
@entity90 - based @entity52 filed voluntary bankruptcy petition
huge spending on pensions and jet fuel at record high
