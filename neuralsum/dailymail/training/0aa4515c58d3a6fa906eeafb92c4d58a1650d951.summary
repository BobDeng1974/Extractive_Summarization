@entity0 is believed to have delayed plans to produce a 12.9inch ' @entity2 ' so it can keep up with demand for its 5.5inch @entity4 6 plus handset			1
the firm confirmed it sold more than 10 million @entity4 6 units during the launch weekend , with recent estimates suggesting it may have sold more than 21 million units in the first two weeks - with over 4 million @entity4 6 units reserved in @entity13			1
it is believed the larger model , the @entity16 , has proved more popular than expected , causing manufacturers to scramble to produce enough screens			1
the firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its @entity32 software called @entity33 , and news @entity34 this month			2
' a new line of imacs with ultra high - resolution @entity38 is in late testing stages within @entity0 , according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer , ' said 9to5 @entity32 ' while the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design , which was introduced in 2012 , it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved @entity52 antennas , ' it says			1
' the top priority for the supply chain is to meet the overwhelming demand for the larger screen iphones , ' a source told the @entity58			2
' the output of the 5.5 - inch @entity62 remains unsatisfactory , ' an unidentified person familiar with @entity0 's supply chain said			1
' it would be challenging for display makers to split resources and spend a few months to ramp up production for a new larger screen @entity34 now			2
' ' everyone is busy with the new iphones , @entity70 's bread and butter			2
chairman [ @entity73 ] has also gone to the @entity75 site to monitor the production closely , ' a @entity70 official said			2
at the @entity75 plant alone , more than 200,000 workers are making @entity4 6 units — overall , @entity70 has well over 1 million workers			1
the bigger 12.9 - inch @entity2 tablet was supposed to enter production in december , it has been claimed			1
it comes as @entity0 is to unveil new @entity34 and new @entity32 computers on 16th october at its @entity87 hq			1
the new gadgets could go on sale on the 24 october - with new @entity32 software , called @entity33 , available as a free download even earlier			0
last week , rumours suggested @entity0 was putting the finishing touches to a new version of it 's @entity95 - including a gold version			1
the small event is likely to be in stark contrast to the star - studded launch of the @entity100 , which saw @entity101 playing before the firm controversially gave away the band 's new album			0
an apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned , next - generation @entity95 has surfaced from @entity106 showing a more trim profile , recessed volume buttons , and the addition of a touch id sensor to the home button			0
according to @entity113 the device comes in at just 7 millimeters thick , the same thickness as the @entity4 6			1
an apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned , next - generation @entity95 has surfaced from @entity106 showing a more trim profile , recessed volume buttons , and the addition of a touch id sensor to the home button			0
in addition to a redesigned speaker grille , the unit also sports a small hole where the mute / orientation lock switch appears on existing @entity34 units			0
the move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full - size tablets , which are in decline			0
until now , @entity34 have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme , but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the @entity87 company 's new @entity4 and @entity62 , which come in three colours			1
the @entity34 have a new sleek design and are thinner new versions of the 9.7 - inch tablet could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the @entity95 , ' people familiar with the matter ' told @entity143			0
the new @entity34 are also predicted to sport a thinner , more rounded design , similar to the @entity4 6			1
hidden code in the latest @entity147 beta software hints that the @entity34 will feature a @entity149 fingerprint sensor and @entity151 functionality			0
the code states that users can ' pay with @entity34 using @entity149			0
with @entity151 , you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information			0
' however , it is not clear whether the new @entity34 will come with @entity158 functionality , which is used for contactless payments , as it relies on a @entity52 or mobile connection			0
@entity151 has only been announced in the @entity161 , so if the @entity34 do get the feature , it may be limited to only @entity161 buyers			0
@entity0 is also rumoured to be launching a larger ipad with a 12.9 - inch screen next year , which if true , could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models			1
the latest swathe of @entity0 tablets could come with a split screen function , which would allow users of an @entity34 to open two apps side - by - side on one screen			1
sales of @entity34 have slumped for two quarters , after climbing from $ 5 billion ( £ 3 billion ) when they were launched in 2010 , to $ 30 billion ( £ 19 billion ) in 2012 and $ 32 billion in 2013 ( £ 20 billion )			0
the firm has n't unveiled an updated @entity34 since last october when it launched the @entity95 and @entity179 , and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens , including recently , @entity0 's @entity62 , which has a 5.5 inch screen			1
the new @entity34 are expected to have a rounded design similar to the recently released @entity62 the new @entity34 are also expected to include @entity149 sensors @entity0 is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales			2
in 1999 it rolled out different coloured imacs which were successful , but sales of its @entity191 – a ' budget ' version of the @entity193 – have not sold as well as the company hoped			2
the company is expected to unveil the new @entity34 at the same time as a range of imacs with @entity25 in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales			0
the new line of @entity201 is rumoured to have ultra high - resolution @entity38 , a thin profile and faster processors as well as improved @entity52 antennas			0
