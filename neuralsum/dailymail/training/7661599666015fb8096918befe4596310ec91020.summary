by @entity0 published : 14:28 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 16:50 est , 13 august 2012 a boy scout leader of a @entity3 - based troop is recovering after being savagely attacked by a rabid beaver at the @entity5 in @entity6			1
@entity7 , 51 , of @entity8 , @entity3 , was swimming in the river with a floating device known as a ' noodle ' when the beaver latched onto his chest			1
after being bitten and clawed at several times , mr @entity7 was finally pulled to shore by @entity16 , 16 , who joined his three fellow scouts in pelting the deranged creature with stones until it died			1
brave : troop 32 from @entity22 , @entity3 was on a field trip to the @entity5 in @entity6 when @entity16 , 16 , ( third from left ) was forced to pull his leader to safety mr @entity7 has received over 20 rabies shots and is said to be recovering well since being treated at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity6			1
the assistant scoutmaster had been co-leading a field trip in the @entity32 park when he felt the animal between his legs in the water			1
@entity36 : a boy scout leader was set upon by a rabid beaver in the @entity39 and was bitten and clawed until members of his troop hauled him to shore and killed the animal recalling the moment the beaver attached itself to his chest , he told the @entity46 : ' i thought it was a giant carp fish			1
' but any such thoughts of over-sized goldfish were soon dispelled as the beaver took a bite at him			1
hero : @entity16 and his fellow boy scouts threw stones at the beaver until they had killed it grabbing hold of his aggressor and attempting to cast it away from his body proved only a temporary solution as the rabid creature came back for more , biting at his leg , buttocks , arm , hand and waist			2
by then , mr @entity7 explained , ' the adrenaline kicked in			2
' ' i grabbed it in its mouth , ' he said			2
' i had it around its bottom jaw as tightly as i could because i knew it was going to either bite me or bite the boys			2
i called the @entity80 to come give me a hand			2
' mr @entity16 of @entity22 , @entity3 , was the first on hand to help the victim and while keeping a careful eye on the beaver , pulled his leader to shore			0
safely on dry land , mr @entity7 hurled the beaver up onto shore where it turned its attention to the noodle and began ripping it apart			0
' we started throwing rocks at it , ' mr @entity16 recalled			0
' we could see it was still dangerous			0
' while the young men wrestled with the beaver , passing canoeists offered to take mr @entity7 to the other side of the river and to get help and another park visitor witnessing the scene called 911			0
mr @entity7 has dismissed the praise bestowed upon him from parents of @entity109 's members saying he did what he had to do to keep the boys safe			0
nevertheless , @entity112 of @entity113 , whose 15 - year - old son , @entity114 was also on the trip , said : ' it was very brave of him			0
who ’d be crazy enough to hang onto a rabid beaver ? ' @entity32 health officials meanwhile claim that an attack from a rabid beaver is unusual and locals to the area struggle to recall the last time something like this happened			1
a river runs through it : health officials in @entity32 say such a vicious attack from a rabid animal is very rare though visitors to the park should always be aware of signs of rabies like unusual and aggressive behaviour the attach , however , follows a similar incident in @entity137 's @entity136 in july where eight - year - old @entity138 and her 11 - year - old sister , @entity139 , were playing with their cousins at @entity142 when a 65 pound beaver bit and scratched their legs			1
@entity145 , director of environmental health services for @entity32 urged people to look out for signs of unusual behaviour among animals that can point to rabies such as sightings of nocturnal animals in daylight hours or aggressive behaviour between domesticated pets			1
mr @entity7 confessed : ' i ’m pretty sore ' but said he has learned a valuable lesson from the incident			0
' when you go out into nature , you always need to veer on the side of caution , ' he said			0
' do n’t assume a wild animal is not sick			0
you have to be on your toes at all times			0
