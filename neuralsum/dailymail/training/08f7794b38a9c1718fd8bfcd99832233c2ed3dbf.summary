the operation involves stimulating an area of the brain and implanting a brain pacemaker to treat the condition and essential tremors			1
mr @entity36 was woken up for part of the procedure and asked to play his guitar to assist the doctors with placing electrodes into the correct position			1
pre-op : doctors can be seen preparing mr @entity36 for surgery in this picture uploaded to @entity7 's vine service getting started : @entity28 tweeted this picture at the start of the operation next to the tag : ' alright ... here we go ! ' doctors broadcast the procedure to commemorate the @entity64 @entity63 's 500th deep brain stimulation operation			1

there is no cure for the condition but surgery such as this and medication can help alleviate symptoms including tremors , muscle stiffness , pain and very slow movement			2
@entity102 involves inserting a pacemaker that emits electronic impulses to affected areas of the brain , which lessens tremor symptoms			2
here surgeons shows exactly how the procedure to implant a pacemaker was carried out to help control the patient 's @entity19 's tremor anniversary : the operation was filmed to mark the 500th time @entity28 has carried out the surgery awake : mr @entity36 , who can be seen holding up a cup of water during the operation , was awakened during the surgery to assist doctors in placing the electrodes in the right place at @entity28 , the patient is kept conscious throughout surgery and is asked to perform tests so that surgeons can check the pacemaker is properly placed			1
@entity28 said it live - tweeted the surgery , which was overseen by dr. @entity143 , with the hope that it would help alleviate future patients ' fear of the procedure			1
tweets posted included : ' removing the skin and drilling through the skull for electrode placement ' and ' electrode is prepared for implantation			1

@entity102 ( @entity102 ) is the main type of surgery used to help alleviate the symptoms experienced when suffering with @entity19 ’s			2
the procedure is not a cure , but it can give patients better control of slow movement , stiffness and tremors			0
it can also mean that the patients does n’t need to take as much medication which in turn reduces the side - effects of strong drugs such as involuntary movement			0
the long - term outcome of deep brain stimulation is very encouraging			0
it is thought that it will remain the main surgical therapy for @entity19 's for the next 30 years			0
@entity102 involves inserting a pacemaker and leads that emit electronic impulses to the affected areas of the brain			0
the majority of people with @entity19 's who have had deep brain stimulation are fitted with a device that contains a non-rechargeable battery			2
on average , the battery lasts between 3 and 5 years depending on the stimulator settings , but some may last longer before a replacement is needed			0
the areas of the brain stimulated are usually the thalymus , the globus pallidus and the subthalmic nucleaus			0
a small electric current is sent through the leads to test how the person 's symptoms respond to stimulation , to make sure they have been put in the right place			0
the leads are connected to extensions that are tunnelled under the skin behind the ear and down the neck			0
they are then connected to a neurostimulator ( a pacemaker device ) , which is placed under the skin around the chest or stomach area			0
the patient is usually kept conscious throughout surgery and is asked to perform tests so that surgeons can check the pacemaker is properly placed			0
once the wounds from surgery have healed , the device will be switched on and the electrodes will deliver high - frequency stimulation to the area of the brain that is targeted			2
it may take several months to fully programme the stimulator and adjust @entity19 's medication to get the most benefit from this treatment .			0
