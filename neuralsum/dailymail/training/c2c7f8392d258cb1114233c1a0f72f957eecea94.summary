@entity0 has issued yet another set of apocalyptic threats as the rogue state refuses to back down in the face of war games between the @entity6 and @entity7			1
an official newspaper has quoted a war veteran vowing to ' rain bullets on the enemy ' while leader @entity12 urged his troops to ' cut their windpipes '			2
the 20 - something leader has been seen looking increasingly warlike in recent pictures posing next to tanks and guns , prompting speculation he is trying to project a ' hard man ' image to shore up his authority ahead of a possible new offensive			0
speech : the dictatorial leader told troops to ' cut the windpipes ' of their enemies war ? @entity0 officials have cancelled a ceasefire agreement made with the south decades ago threat : @entity0 's @entity12 , pictured here with his troops , has pledged to attack his rivals hard man : over the past couple of days @entity12 appears to have projected a tougher image @entity0 's army this week officially cancelled an armistice it signed with the @entity7 at the end of @entity41			1
the move makes it more likely that recent tensions , prompted by new @entity46 sanctions as well as the joint military exercises which started yesterday , could bubble over into all - out warfare			2
@entity49 , the official newspaper of @entity12 's @entity50 , quoted an 80 - year - old veteran of the @entity41 supposedly expressed the national mood			1
' i am still keeping a bullet that i failed to fire at a trench in the 1950s because the @entity6 imperialists and their stooges signed an armistice agreement , ' he apparently said			1
' send me to the trench			0
i want to rain bullets on the enemy to my heart 's content			0
' @entity65 : official media have published a series of threats towards @entity7 and the @entity69 looking at a tank : @entity12 has made a series of visits to elite military installations in recent days crowd : @entity12 receives a rapturous response from an audience of soldiers at a military base @entity12 himself issued a direct threat to the @entity6 and @entity7 over their long - scheduled drills on the @entity83			1
' as the saying goes , a guy who is fond of playing with fire is bound to perish in flames , ' he told troops			0
' all the enemies quite often playing with fire in the sensitive hotspot should be thrown into a cauldron once i issue an order			0
' once an order is issued you should break the waists of the crazy enemies , totally cut their windpipes and thus clearly show them what a real war is like			0
' the leader 's martial attitude in recent photographs is in stark contrast to the laid - back image he attempted to project during the recent visit of former basketball star @entity109 to the pariah nation			0
pictures from that visit showed him laughing along with his guest at a sports match and hosting the star at a lavish banquet			0
inspection : @entity12 holds up a guitar at the base on an island near the border with @entity7 after the start of the military drills yesterday , @entity7 officials said their northern counterparts did not answer two calls on a hotline between the sides , apparently following through on an earlier vow to cut the communication channel because of the drills			1
@entity133 has launched a bombast - filled propaganda campaign against the drills , which involve 10,000 @entity7 and about 3,000 @entity6 troops , and last week 's @entity46 vote to impose new sanctions over the @entity0 's february 12 nuclear test			1
@entity133 is n't believed to be able to build a warhead small enough to mount on a long - range missile , and the @entity0 's military has repeatedly vowed in the past to scrap the 1953 armistice			0
@entity0 wants a formal peace treaty , security guarantees and other concessions , as well as the removal of 28,500 @entity6 troops stationed in @entity7			1
@entity7 and @entity6 officials have been closely monitoring @entity133 's actions and parsing the torrent of recent rhetoric from the @entity0 , which has been more warlike than usual			1
change of tune : just two weeks ago @entity12 was pictured enjoying himself with @entity154 star @entity109 @entity0 regularly claims @entity7 - @entity6 drills are a preparation for invasion , but @entity133 has signaled more worry about the drills that began monday			1
the drills follow @entity46 sanctions that the @entity0 says are the result of @entity6 hostility aimed at toppling its political system			1
@entity0 has also warned @entity7 of a nuclear war on the divided peninsula and said it was cancelling nonaggression pacts			1
under newly inaugurated president @entity169 , @entity7 's defence ministry , which often brushes off @entity0 threats , has looked to send a message of strength in response to the latest threats			1
the ministry warned on friday that the @entity0 's government would ' evaporate from the face of the @entity179 ' if it ever used a nuclear weapon			0
the @entity181 also said the @entity6 is fully capable of defending itself against a @entity0 ballistic attack			2
@entity0 has said the @entity6 mainland is within the range of its long - range missiles , and an army general told a @entity133 rally last week that the military is ready to fire a long - range nuclear - armed missile to turn @entity192 into a ' sea of fire			1
' best of friends : @entity12 at dinner in @entity133 with @entity109 and his wife @entity198 , left while outside scientists are still trying to determine specifics , the @entity0 's rocket test in december and third atomic bomb test last month may have pushed the country a step closer to acquiring the ability to hit the @entity6 with weapons of mass destruction			2
analysts , however , say @entity133 is still years away from acquiring the smaller , lighter nuclear warheads needed for a credible nuclear missile program			0
but there are still worries about a smaller conflict			0
@entity0 has a variety of missiles and other weapons capable of striking @entity7			2
in 2010 , @entity0 shelled a @entity7 island and allegedly torpedoed a @entity7 warship , killing a total of 50 @entity7			2
both incidents occurred near the disputed western sea boundary , a recurring flashpoint between the @entity223 that has seen three other bloody naval skirmishes since 1999			0
@entity12 visited two islands just north of the sea boundary last week and ordered troops there to open fire immediately if a single enemy shell is fired on @entity0 waters			0
@entity12 was also quoted as saying his military is fully ready to fight an ' all - out war ' and that he will order a ' just , great advance for national unification ' if the enemy makes even a slight provocation , according to the @entity0 's official @entity236 .			2
