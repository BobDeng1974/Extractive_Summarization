by @entity0 published : 16:45 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 17:05 est , 5 september 2013 the first refreshed logo for @entity2 in its 18 years was planned to the smallest , minute detail by ceo @entity4 with her design team and comes after the internet giant ran a month - long media campaign parading each rejected logo every day			1
designed to build up expectation for the unveiling in a month which will see the launch of the new @entity13 and the final episode of @entity16 's ' @entity15 ' , @entity2 finally released their logo at midnight edt			2
described by some tech - bloggers as having a ' parade of all the people you decided not to marry before your wedding ' , some of the designs have been praised , while others have been greeted with relief that @entity28 did not plump for that particular one			0
day one : this was the first logo released by @entity2 to illustrate how they came to choose their new logo this futuristic logo was rejected by @entity2 and released as the 22nd ( left ) such discarded while on the right the 20th logo released was clearly never going to be used day 5 : @entity2 ceo wanted to create an air of anticipation around their new logo and this effort was released on august 5th day 10 : despite the choice of ceo @entity4 and @entity2 executives , the logo unveiled on day 10 proved to be the most popular indeed , @entity46 at @entity47 had some acerbic words for the rejected logos , calling @entity50 ' what happens when i let those kids of mine play on my computer and they screw up the fonts			0
' while the new logo was apparently the best of the 29 options available to @entity28 from her design team , the company still displayed the previous 29 online and asked the public to vote on them			2
@entity65 , the photo imaging app that allows users to compare two photos and vote on them reveals that the most popular of the 30 logos , including the chosen one , was the 10th day of the project			0
however , the new logo is not just an aesthetic change by @entity28			0
this jazzy logo was the 21st unveiled by @entity2 and came just 10 days before the internet giant revealed their choice on the left is the 4th rejected logo that @entity2 considered using while on the right is the 3rd that bears some passing resemblance to the original one @entity2 's 11th logo was reminiscent of @entity84 's iconic logo that has been in use for over 100 years since taking over as ceo of the web giant in july 2012 , she has made a remarkable number of changes to @entity2 and its products , including updating @entity93 and @entity2			1
notably , @entity28 has begun purchasing start - ups , including @entity95 for more than one billion dollars			2
the redesigned look unveiled early this morning is part of a makeover that @entity2 has been undergoing since the @entity100 , @entity101 , company hired @entity102 executive @entity4 to become ceo 14 months ago			0
she has already spruced up @entity2 's front page , email and @entity93 photo - sharing service , as well as engineering a series of acquisitions aimed at attracting more traffic on mobile devices			2
the new @entity2 logo and ( inset ) the old one which has now disappeared the shopping spree has been highlighted by @entity2 's $ 1.1billion ( Â£ 720million ) purchase of @entity95 , an internet blogging service where the company rolled out its new logo			1
the logo was shown in purple spelling out the word @entity2 , with no letters touching and ending with an exclamation point			0
' we wanted a logo that stayed true to our roots ( whimsical , purple , with an exclamation point ) yet embraced the evolution of our products ' a statement on the website said			0
in an effort to drum up more interest in the changeover , @entity2 spent the past 30 days showing some of the proposed logos that ms @entity4 and other executives cast aside			0
the revision is the first time that @entity2 has made a significant change to its logo since a few tweaks shortly after co-founders @entity143 and @entity145 incorporated the company in 1995			1
ms @entity4 's overhaul of @entity2 has attracted a lot of attention , but so far it has not provided a significant lift to the company 's revenue			1
@entity2 depends on internet advertising to make most of its money , an area where the company 's growth has been anaemic while more marketing cash flows to rivals such as @entity102 and @entity160			1
@entity2 's stock has climbed by nearly 80 % , but most of that gain has been driven by the company 's 24 % stake in @entity167 's @entity166			1
investors prize @entity170 because it has emerged as one of the fastest growing companies on the internet			0
@entity4 's overhaul of @entity2 has attracted a lot of attention , but so far it has not provided a significant lift to the company 's revenue			1

new logo was revealed today in a post on the company 's @entity95 page
it is the first time it has changed in 18 years
