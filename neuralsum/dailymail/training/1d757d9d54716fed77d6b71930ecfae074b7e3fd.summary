by @entity0 for many , @entity1 is an obsession			2
but scattered bricks can be untidy - not to mention incredibly painful when you unwittingly step on one			0
but now an app built for @entity7 ’s @entity6 could make it a thing of the past , as users can build whimsical creations online			1
the two companies have joined up so that people of all ages can build bright blocky structures on their phones , tablets and computers and show them off to the world			2
. the app , called build with @entity6 , lets people build creations by dragging different shapes and sizes of the colourful bricks onto a virtual board , all without having to struggle to find the ideal brick in a jumbled up box			1
while real @entity1 models have to be dismantled to make way for new construction projects , @entity7 and @entity1 ’s app allows people to publish their creations on a plot of land anywhere in the world , as they are overlaid on @entity55			1
@entity56 : an app build for @entity7 's @entity6 browser allows @entity1 fans to build whimsical creations online using different shapes , sizes and colours of bricks as well as a base board ( pictured ) originally built by a team in @entity33 to showcase @entity34 - a 3d graphics technology - and to celebrate @entity1 's 50th birthday , the experiment has now been rolled out across the world			1
creations can be placed on @entity55 ( illustrated in a promotional video ) so you could build your house in situ , re-create a famous landmark , or build something the world has never seen and plonk it in the middle of @entity29			2
with a certain level of cooperation and precision , whole cityscapes could potentially be created and it is easy for users to see other creations situated close to their own			0
fans of the plastic toy might miss using their hands to create buildings , so the app makes use of the touchscreens on phones and tablets so that users can pinch and drag bricks into position , according to a @entity7 blog post			1
builders can tag their creations on a map ( left ) and their buildings can be placed wherever they like in the world , allowing people to search areas of land to find nearby towers - such as the one pictured right , which can be found in @entity106 with a certain level of cooperation and precision , whole cityscapes could potentially be created and it is easy for users to see other creations situated close to their own			1
here , a type of neighbourhood in @entity33 is created users of the app can sign in with their @entity116 account , which enables them to find buildings their friends have created			2
completed builds are categorised in different systems so that people can sort , filter and search for different types of structures – including @entity124 and @entity125			0
to ‘ hone your engineering skills ’ @entity1 fans can learn new skills from a number of short tutorials so that they can build structures that will be featured in the upcoming @entity131 film , ‘ the @entity132 , ’ which due to be released on 7 february			0
completed builds are categorised in different systems so that people can sort , filter and search for different types of structures – including @entity124 and @entity125			0
here are two whimsical creations from @entity33 ( left ) and the @entity139 ( right ) @entity1 and @entity7 joined forces so that people of all ages can build bright blocky structures on their phones , tablets and computers ( pictured ) users of the app can sign in with their @entity116 account , which enables them to find buildings their friends have created , scattered around the globe ( pictured ) @entity1 men are set to outnumber people in 2019 it is predicted that there could be a miniature @entity1 figure for every person on @entity156 in 2019			1
according to a mathematical online comic , @entity1 has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade			2
at the end of 2006 , the company announced there were four billion miniature figures in existence , being played with by children across the planet			0
a physics graduate from @entity171 , who is behind the web comic @entity174 has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of @entity179 will match up in 2019 and the plastic people will go on to out - number humans			0
if the predictions are correct , there will be almost eight billion people and the same amount of @entity1 figures calling @entity156 home in 2019			0
@entity1 said in 2008 that it has made 400 billion @entity1 bricks since the company began , which is enough for 62 each for every person in existence at that time			1
the first @entity1 figurine went on sale in 1978 and since then , billions have been produced , making them the world 's biggest population group , according to the company .			0

the @entity6 app is designed to be played on @entity204 *smartphones* , tablets and computers
a virtual tool *kit* allows users to drag different sizes , shapes and colours of @entity1 bricks into place on a blank base board
buildings can be placed on plots of land around the world and people can view them by exploring a @entity1 *version* of @entity55
