lawyer @entity51 noted that the @entity9 provides that ' no person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself			0
' ' @entity76 believes that ms @entity25 has inappropriately sought the protection of the privilege against self - incrimination , " he wrote			1
' the privilege is personal ; it can not be used to protect another person ... otherwise , the privilege could be used as a shield to protect a witness ' friends , and to deny a civil litigant probative evidence			0
' a witness may not invoke the @entity9 in order to hide knowledge of a friend 's criminal conduct			2
' after @entity17 disappeared , authorities searched the @entity92 was working at on june 4			0

the civil case is a process that is independent of the active , on - going criminal investigation being conducted by the @entity43			0
investigators have long focused on @entity12 , although until this point , had not named her as a suspect or filed criminal charges			2

' plainly and simply , @entity31 's lawsuit is a quest for information to move the criminal investigation forward and to taint any jury pool , ' according to the filing			0
civil allegations require a lower standard of proof — a preponderance of evidence — than criminal charges , which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt			0
compelling her to testify , @entity180 wrote , could force @entity12 to invoke her constitutional right against self - incrimination , pointing out the weak spots in her case			2
happier times : @entity31 smiles and holds her son on the beach playtime : a family photo shows a smiling @entity17 enjoying the playground ' the burden on @entity12 of being required to participate in this lawsuit before the district attorney and police have completed their investigation squarely jeopardizes her constitutional rights , ' @entity180 wrote			2
