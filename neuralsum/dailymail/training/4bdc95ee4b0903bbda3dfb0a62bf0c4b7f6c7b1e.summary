she wants to nominate all the other dogs here and all the cats as well , yeah			0
his stunt copies the ‘ ice bucket challenge ’ , in which people film themselves being doused in freezing water to raise money and awareness for @entity48 – a type of motor neurone disease – before daring others to do the same			2
but the @entity20 is investigating and said it was likely the dog had been harmed			1
@entity55 users branded the video ‘ awful ’ and ‘ just wrong ’			1
@entity57 , 52 , said : ‘ it really upset me the way it was plunged headfirst … people are appalled by it and it ’s the sort of thing that could spark an awful trend and be replicated			0
it ’s one thing to put yourself through discomfort but pets do n’t have a choice			0
‘ lots of people complained to @entity55 but they simply said it did not contravene their rules on violence … it ’s awful , it ’s just wrong			1
