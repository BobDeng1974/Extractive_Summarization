over three - quarters of those surveyed incorrectly believed that chilli con carne was first eaten in @entity27 , not the @entity28 , while only 10 per cent knew the correct origins of cheesecake – @entity37			2

@entity8 , 96.3 % incorrect : @entity41 we ’re not always clueless , however – fortunately only a third of respondents thought that the @entity75 - made @entity74 roll was from @entity74			2
the survey results also showed that food thought to be of @entity43 heritage is most often consumed by @entity79 , with our favourite international cuisines revealed to be @entity81 and then @entity57			1
@entity82 was a close fourth with 53 per cent of respondents eating curry - based dishes more than once a week and @entity86 cuisine came fifth with a quarter of people enjoying dishes from south of the border regularly			0
emerging cuisines appear to be @entity91 , @entity50 and @entity93 foods			2
