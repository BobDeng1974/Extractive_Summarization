a campaign to help elderly people use the internet to develop passions including travel and cooking has been turned into a new documentary			1
@entity7 follows a group of senior citizens aged between 76 and 93 as they discover the world of the internet through the guidance of teenage mentors			1
the film recently premiered in @entity15 and @entity16 and is currently being screened across the @entity17			1
the group featured in the film all had different interests , with some eager to get onto @entity21 to see photos of their grandchildren and others wanting to learn how to cook or find inspiration for travelling			1
the film also features the elderly group competing to get the most hits for an online @entity30 video			1
it includes 89 year - old shura who decides to create a @entity30 cooking tutorial while another member of the group , 93 - year - old @entity37 , is shown making a rap video			1
the documentary , directed by @entity40 , was inspired by a campaign set up by her sisters @entity44 and @entity45 five years ago			2
the pair began recruiting friends to visit a local retirement home twice a week to teach elderly residents how to use the internet after witnessing first - hand how it had transformed their grandparents ' lives			1
after learning some basic skills , their grandparents were in touch several times a week by email , @entity21 and @entity59			2
@entity7 follows a group of senior citizens aged between 76 and 93 as they discover the world of the internet through the guidance of teenage mentors ' our goal is to get as many seniors on the internet as possible â€“ especially as when seniors age they can become isolated , ' @entity66 said			1
' we really want to get them on the internet to stop that isolation and get then connected again			2
' @entity76 started volunteering with the program when she was in high school			2
' i 'm always on the computer , so to me it was like : " i 'm doing this anyway i may as well help someone learn what everybody else is using and help them get connected into that whole world that exists out there " , ' @entity76 said			2
' i grew up with a computer in my house			2
to me a computer is as simple as picking up a pen , so having to learn how to really explain something and take your time i think is rewarding			0
' the group featured in the film all had different interests , with some eager to get onto @entity21 to see photos of their grandchildren and others wanting to learn how to cook or find inspiration for travelling the documentary features 89 year - old shura , who decides to create a @entity30 cooking tutorial @entity104 , 89 , was originally interested in reuniting with his friends from @entity106 , but instead turned his interest towards reconnecting with his estranged daughter via @entity59			1
at 76 - years - old , @entity109 was the youngest senior of the group			1
she wanted to get online so she would n't miss out on party invites , and is also shown being introduced to online dating			1
the film has partnered with the @entity114 ( @entity114 ) foundation , which is also trying to encourage seniors citizens to get online			1
director @entity40 said : ' i just think the internet has really changed the way that we communicate			0
' in the past , senior citizens lived with their kids and grandchildren in the same house , then they lived in the same town , now we have families who are living across the world from each other			0
' the rest of us adapted by staying in touch through technology , but they 've kind of been left behind and left out of that			0
' as they get older , they ca n't move around as much ; they ca n't fly to @entity135 or another country to visit family members			0
' the internet really does help them to reconnect with family members that they do n't get to do that often			0
' asked what had most surptised her about making the films , @entity40 added : ' i think it taught me that you can have a lot of fun in your later years and that retirement age is n't something to be afraid of			0
' i think a lot of people dread getting older and think that there 's no fun to be had , and that 's just not true			0
' people are living way longer now and they 're living healthy , happy lives			0
a lot of these senior citizens were n't sitting around bored			0
' they 're active , they 're out there , they have busy schedules			0
it 's good to know that there are things to look forward to in later life			0
