@entity12 , a cake - maker with a shop in @entity15 , @entity16 , has created a healthy cupcake especially for dogs , and one which she hopes might curb @entity22 's canine obesity epidemic			1
some 35 per cent of all dogs in @entity22 are overweight			2
but , made out of gluten - free flour , low - fat peanut butter , bananas and low - fat cream cheese frosting - and occasionally decorated with @entity29 biscuits or doggy chocolate drops - @entity11 wo n't be adding to the problem			1
in fact , the sweet treats have proved extremely popular with both dogs and their owners , and have been flying off the shelves of the @entity37			0
lip - licking good : @entity38 , a white @entity39 , tries one of @entity12 's @entity11 in the @entity37 in @entity15 , @entity16 a lifelong dog - lover and former marketing manager , miss @entity12 said : ' i had dozens of dogs passing the shop on a daily basis with their masters and mistresses and every time their tails would wag and their noses would go in to overdrive in the direction of my kitchen			1
' one day i just got chatting about it to a friend and he said it 's a shame the dogs could n't enjoy the cake and i went away and did some research			0
' i thought straight away people love to buy their pets treats and it seemed like a gap in the market			0
' @entity38 , my friend 's dog , got to be the test dog , and he just wolfed them down			1
and our next door neighbour 's dog loved them too			2
' give a dog a bone : pupcakes are decorated with mini dog biscuits or canine - friendly chocolate drops concerned about coming under fire for creating a sugary treat for dogs , miss @entity12 formulated a healthy , sugar - free , low - fat recipe that dogs can enjoy without worrying about piling on the puppy pounds			1
completely vegan , @entity11 are also suitable for humans ( if a bit bland for our tastebuds , admits miss @entity12 , who has tried them herself ) , though you should remove the dog biscuit topping or doggy chocolate drops first			1
and now the boutique has even bigger plans for the future			0
' we 've started to do big @entity11 too now , for bigger dogs like @entity98 , ' said miss @entity12			1
' they 're six or eight inches and would serve about eight or ten people or one or two big dogs			0
' miss @entity12 used to be just a hobby baker , but took up the craft professionally after being asked to bake a wedding cake comprising over one hundred lemon cupcakes with iced chicks on top , and a giant cupcake featuring two ' bride , groom ' chicks			1
she now makes hundreds of cakes every day , mainly for corporate events and weddings			0
' but being a lifelong dog lover and many of our regular customers having dogs , we decided to start catering for them			2
we got a request for a bowl of water for a puppy outside and that was the trigger for us deciding to welcome them in			0
' they 're a bit of a treat and a bit of fun and are creating a bit of a stir			0
the feedback has been fantastic - a couple of dogs have tried to push through the door into the shop and we think it 's because they like our @entity11 so much			2
' it 's going so well that it is opening up a whole new market to us			0
we love it and the dogs do too			0
' tasty morsel : ' we 've started to do big @entity11 too now , for bigger dogs like @entity98 , they 're six or eight inches and would serve about eight or ten people or one or two big dogs ' dog obesity in @entity22 is dramatically on the rise , with 35 per cent of dogs classed as overweight and predictions that over half of the nation 's dogs will be overweight by 2022 , according to recent figures by insurance company @entity155			2
the number of overweight dogs rose by 37 per cent between 2006 and 2011 , with the figure reaching a collar - busting 2.9m out of 8.3m last year			2
if dog obesity continues to increase at the current rate there will be approximately 3.8m obese dogs in the @entity22 by 2016 - 46 per cent of the current dog population			1
