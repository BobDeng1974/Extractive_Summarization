chancellor @entity2 is said to have ' hardened ' his views on @entity12 since taking office , and now takes seriously the prospect of @entity4 severing ties with @entity22 @entity26 is under growing pressure to set out a tougher stance on @entity12 , with up to 100 @entity11 mps set to defy the prime minister by pledging to vote to leave the @entity5 no matter how much power he manages to claw back from @entity22			1
such a move would be widely seen as a vote of no confidence in the prime minister ’s ability to win a good deal for @entity4 as part of his plans for a renegotiation of powers before an in - out referendum			0
mr @entity15 , the former @entity11 mp who defected to @entity16 last week , claimed that that mr @entity26 was not ‘ serious ’ about @entity5 reform and wanted to recommend an ‘ in ’ vote			2

’ the conservative party has been rocked by the dramatic defection of @entity15 ( right ) to join @entity81 's @entity16 however he has arrived at two conclusions			1
‘ the first was that exit was no longer unthinkable : a sequence of events leading to that end could be imagined , and it was not just the crazies and the bores who were enthused by this			2
’ the second conclusion was that the countries outside the @entity65 were suffering			0
‘ the currency bloc was becoming the real decision - making crucible and voting weights were shifting in its favour on matters of vital @entity4 interest , such as banking			0
’ in speech in january , mr @entity2 said the @entity11 plan for renegotiation was is to ‘ change the @entity5 and to change @entity4 ’s relationship with it , and then to place the decision in the hands of the @entity4 people : do you want to stay in a reformed @entity12 , or would you prefer to leave ? ’ but at the time he stressed that his preference was to remain in the @entity5 .			2
