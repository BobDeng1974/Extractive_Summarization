an exotic bird in @entity1 was recorded making incredible sounds that would n’t be out of place on a video game			2
the @entity5 , which resides at the @entity7 breeding centre , is native to @entity8 and is known to be a good mimic of other birds and man - made sounds			1
with the ever - growing presence of human ’s in their natural habitats , the bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song			2
videoed behind a fence , the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound			1
following this the bird makes a noise that sounds like running water before a @entity32 style tune emerges from it			1
discussing the video , companion parrot behavioural expert @entity33 spoke with @entity37 about the various theories regarding the function of these sounds			0
the @entity5 is native to @entity8 and resides at the @entity7 breeding centre ‘ several groups of birds have a lifelong ability to learn to reproduce new sounds ; notably parrots , starlings and crows , ’ said mr @entity33			1
the particular @entity47 belongs to the @entity50 / @entity49 family			0
‘ some birds may use them to impress a mate or their peers within their flock , ’ he added			0
‘ most birds using mimicry are highly social species , with a complex vocal repertoire , which includes innate calls and learnt calls			0
the bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song ‘ as social species they use their calls as language			2
there are often regional dialects within bird groups			0
so the same species shows differences in its calls across its range			0
’ mr @entity33 also noted that sometimes captive birds confined to cages use their ability to mimic to relieve their boredom and ensure responses from their owners			0
the original video was uploaded to @entity87 account : swiatoczamigoski by a @entity90 - based blogger who has spent some time volunteering at the @entity1 breeding centre			1
