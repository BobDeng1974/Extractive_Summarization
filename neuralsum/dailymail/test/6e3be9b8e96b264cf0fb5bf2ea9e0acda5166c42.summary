@entity1 investigators have launched an appeal to track down fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster			1
photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released , with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward			1
it comes at the request of some of the victims ' families , said officials , with officers having been previously unable to identify the individuals in the images			2
they form part of an ongoing @entity23 inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 @entity29 fans			1
investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 @entity1 disaster police say the ' unusual ' appeal is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims ' families issued on behalf of the coroner sir @entity44 , the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims ' families ' more about how they died , officials said			1
asked why it had taken more than a year to release the images , a spokesman said police had been trying to identify the people in the footage by poring over statements and other @entity55 footage			1
' it is important to stress that we believe these people can help the coroner ’s inquest process , ' said assistant commissioner @entity61 of @entity62 , the police force set up to look into the disaster			1
' i know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then i would urge them to get in touch immediately			0
' there are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions			2
' ninety - six people died at the disaster after @entity29 fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed			1
previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the @entity87 in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed			0
the home secretary @entity90 launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year			0
while the images are not new to the investigation it is the first time they have been shared publicly			0
they have been released at the request of some of the victims ' families with officers having previously been unable to identify the people in the footage despite taking thousands of statements			2
investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal released today while the images are 26 years old , investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses			2

right , another person pictured in the appeal who was stuck behind the enclosure where fans were crushed another fan pictured in the appeal			0
anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact @entity62 officers while officers said it was ' unusual ' to carry out such appeals as today 's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact			1
one person has already been traced as a result of the appeal			0
' i have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this , ' added mr @entity61			0
' the @entity62 website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance			2
' it is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason i urge people to remember the warning issued by the coroner at the start of the fresh inquests , which he reiterated in february 2014			0
' i also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the attorney general ’s office on 10 march 2014			0
' it is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the @entity1 disaster on social media and forums			0
' among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in @entity188 are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time			0
if identified , the people in the images released today could act as witnesses in the next phase of the inquest during which each of the 96 victims ' deaths will be examined			2
ninety - six people were killed in the 1989 disaster ( above )			1
