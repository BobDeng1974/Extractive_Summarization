a fine piece of defending from @entity53 denied wednesday striker may a tap - in as the former @entity97 man desperately intercepted @entity37 's cut - back while the ever - dangerous @entity99 tested @entity100 with a low drive for @entity2			2
it continued to be an open game as wednesday went close through @entity43 's testing effort which forced @entity51 into a good low save , while at the other end @entity62 looked every inch the Â£ 5million striker as he caused the hosts ' defence endless problems			2
however , the former @entity113 man was not involved as @entity2 forged into a 37th - minute lead , which was reward for a sustained spell of pressure			2
instead it was former wednesday winger @entity30 who was at the heart of the action as his teasing ball was guided home by the head of @entity29			2
provider : @entity2 winger @entity59 set up @entity29 to score the winning goal at @entity7 battling for the ball : @entity31 's @entity39 is challenged by @entity57 of @entity2 wednesday 's response was almost immediate as @entity38 dragged a shot wide from the edge of the box when he had time to compose himself			1
the @entity70 fightback was more vigorous after the break as they searched for a leveller with may having three efforts in quick succession , two saved by @entity51 and one was dragged wide			0
@entity2 's goal was coming under siege and @entity51 pulled out a fine stretching save to deny @entity38 while @entity52 and @entity53 defiantly blocked efforts in a mad scramble			1
@entity12 's men had to survive a late onslaught as @entity51 superbly tipped over from @entity44 's curler before another scramble was desperately cleared away			1
but they held on and headed away from @entity7 with the points in the bag and looking definite promotion material			0
happy man : @entity12 will be delighted with his side 's result against @entity31 all smiles : @entity156 is congratulated by team - mate @entity99 at the final whistle			1
