by @entity0 published : 05:49 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 10:22 est , 19 september 2012 celebrated physicist , sir @entity1 , was asked by @entity3 officials to defect during his trip to the @entity3 at the height of the @entity6			1
after he refused , he believes members of the @entity8 tried to wipe his memories of the visit using radiation , extracts from his diaries released yesterday reveal			1
his @entity6 diaries , kept hidden for 50 years , were promised only to be published upon his death			1
they reveal a fascinating story of @entity8 brainwashing , radiation weapons and an astronomer 's secret role at the centre of @entity23 's nuclear defences , being told in full for the first time			1
sir @entity1 , the astronomer behind the @entity25 , reveals in his diaries that the @entity3 may have tried to remove memories from his brain using radiation released by the family of sir @entity1 , after his death last month , they are an account of his visit to observatories in the @entity35 in the 1960s			1
if @entity39 suspicions at the time were correct , his tale is one of the most fascinating revelations of the @entity6			0
his son , @entity43 , speaking to @entity44 today said : ' they are an account of an extra-ordinary exchange at the height of the @entity6			2
' in 1963 sir @entity1 , who died aged 98 , went on a scientific visit to the @entity3			1
on his return and for a month afterwards the celebrated physicist felt inexplicably unwell			1
doctors could not explain why and his illness was left a mystery			0
but he believed until his death this august that someone did - the @entity57 security services			2
sir @entity1 led the construction of the @entity60 which launched in 1959 and tracked the @entity3 's @entity62 satellite - the first of many achievements			1
secret : this section of his diaries shows an insert from the summer of 1963 , when he went to visit @entity69 details of @entity1 's flight ticket to @entity69 in the archived diaries , which were released yesterday ink stained with scribbles , the incredible diaries detail an extraordinary account during the height of the war his visit to @entity35 , written about his his diary extracts , pictured , was shortly after the @entity81 in an earlier interview the scientist said it was then used as the first ' early warning device ' of a @entity3 nuclear attack			1
this , he said , put him in the front line and prompted the @entity57 military to try and harm him during a visit behind the @entity91 in 1963			1
the diaries , which were kept in the archive at @entity95 's @entity94 and at last set out his suspicions , were released yesterday by his family and have been seen by @entity44			2
the @entity8 , he claimed , had tried to wipe his memories with a beam of focused radiation			2
his visit , as part of a @entity23 delegation , to observatories in the @entity35 , included a surprise trip to an unexpectedly advanced radio telescope at @entity107			1
after the visit to the telescope , he claims @entity3 officials tried to persuade him to defect			2
he refused , saying : ' i am an @entity112 and i wish to return to @entity112			0
' but when he returned home all was not well			0
' after a few days at home i became mysteriously ill ' , he explains in a foreword to the diaries			2
' there has never been an explanation of this sudden hiatus			0
' debriefed by @entity39 , he heard an astonishing theory			0
the @entity122 in @entity107 , @entity35			0
@entity1 's visit , as part of a @entity23 delegation , included a visit to the advanced device he wrote : ' the intelligence agents thought that by some means - probably radiation , the @entity3 tried to removed from my brain all memories of my visit to @entity107			1
' sir @entity1 was so disturbed by the illness and its explanation , that he considered quitting astronomy altogether			1
he said : ' i visited the bursar and told him that i was proposing to resign from @entity141 and go into the @entity142			0
he did not dissuade me but my family did so , for which i am everlastingly grateful			0
' he said in a later memorandum : ' in retrospect , i should not have accepted that invitation to visit the @entity3 ... in the summer of 1963 and furthermore the @entity148 in @entity149 should have advised me not to visit @entity69			1
' sir @entity1 , pictured in front of the telescope at @entity25 , said after a visit to the @entity3 , @entity3 officials tried to persuade him to defect @entity43 , the astronomer 's son , who is president of the @entity156 , told @entity44 : ‘ what is fascinating about these diaries is the details of my father carrying out this scientific research right through the most dangerous part of the @entity6			1
' my father was one of the leading scientists in the @entity164 at the time			0
he was at the front line of defence during the height of the @entity6			1
' i remain to this day angry that he was sent to @entity57 so soon after the @entity81 , when he was obviously a key person in @entity23 defence			1
' speaking about his illness following the trip to the @entity3 , he said : ‘ you and i will never really know what happened			2
' he believes that the stress of the responsibility he carried for @entity23 's safety could have been an explanation for his sheer exhaustion upon his return to the @entity23			1
he said : ' there is the spooks explanation and then there is the mundane explanation – that he was so exhausted due to tremendous strain			0
at the time , unknown to the public , @entity25 was not simply a astronomical establishment , but also one of the most important military tools in the free world			0
@entity43 added : ‘ the reason for the embargo on the papers is that he wanted the context of the @entity6 to be published before his diary entries were released			0
' @entity195 1,the first artificial @entity197 satellite			0
the @entity3 launched it in 1957 and the @entity25 telescope tracked it the diaries also detail a discussion sir @entity1 had about the @entity203 - which experts say effectively began with the @entity3 launch of the @entity62 1 artificial satellite in 1957 - a device @entity208 tracked			1
sir @entity1 wrote in 1963 : ' they see great technical diffciulties which still have to be solved			1
' the president said it was impossible to foretell if it would be possible to arrive there quickly although one must remember the contrast between today and the @entity216			0
then he asked me to explain why i thought it was necessary to get a man on the moon			0
the discussion which followed clearly indicated that the president is thick in the middle of the same kind of arguments which are taking place in the west			0
' at least i realise now that to talk of a @entity57 moon landing in 1968 or 1970 means nothing more than guessing at dates which they themselves are not even doing			0
' although @entity25 was built for scientific endeavour , @entity232 very quickly realised that it was the only mechanism available to them for tracking @entity3 inter-continental ballistic missiles			2
through its huge radio telescope , they would be able to give seven minutes ’ warning to @entity149 of approaching missiles — enough time , intelligence chiefs believed , to save a million lives			0
the celebrated physicist in front of the @entity208 , which was used for tracking @entity3 inter-continental ballistic missiles 1913 sir @entity1 was born in @entity247 , @entity248			1
he went on to study at @entity249			0
1936 @entity1 gained his phd and was persuaded to join @entity95 physics department			2
1939 drafted into war work , he was involved in the @entity255 radar - assisted bomb project that targeted submarines			0
@entity257 said that the ' setback in our u-boat campaign is due to a single technical invention of our enemies '			0
sir @entity1 worked on the development of radar , which gave the @entity265 a vital edge over the @entity267			1
1946 appointed an obe for his radar work , @entity1 tested a theory that echoes seen by @entity271 might be reflections from cosmic rays			2
he learnt instead that they were from meteors , but it created interest in radio astronomy			0
1952 signed a contract with a @entity281 company to build 250ft steerable radio dish — the start of a project whose costs led to threats of imprisonment for @entity1			2
its debts were settled when the @entity23 and @entity292 governments started paying for its military surveillance capabilities and @entity294 wrote a cheque for £ 80,000 1955 after returning to the @entity95 following the war , @entity1 began planning the @entity25			1
in the 1955 the construction began for the @entity298 which remains the defining feature of @entity25 and is the world ’s third largest steerable telescope			0
1957 the new @entity25 telescope tracked @entity195 1 — the first of many achievements			0
later it helped to study pulsars , quasars and gravitational lenses around black holes			0
@entity1 said of it : “ i had difficulty convincing anyone that it would be of use astronomically for 15 years and the engineers said i ’d be lucky if it lasted for 15 years			2
1961 sir @entity1 earned his knighthood principally in recognition of his role in founding the university 's @entity25			1
2008 the telescope was saved from closure august august 2012 sir @entity1 died aged 98			1

celebrated physicist *requested* diaries to be published only on his death
sir @entity1 had secret role at centre of @entity23 's nuclear defences
@entity334 tried to remove from brain all memories of @entity3 visit
son ' angry ' that father , ' front line of defence ' , was *allowed* to go to @entity69
