brave : @entity6 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , decided to chart her daily life through photography every day for a year after she was diagnosed with skin cancer jumping for joy : from her trips to the beach to interesting meals she has eaten , @entity6 was determined to record the lighter moments in her life eye catching : @entity6 's reflection can be seen on a friend 's pupil , one of more than 300 snaps has shared on website @entity28 green and pleasant land : @entity6 took a six - hour bike trip spanning @entity15 , @entity32 and @entity33 , which according to her entry , was ' worth the numb bum ' she published photos of her daily life on sharing site @entity28 and has built up an international following			1
the 41 - year - old amateur photographer from @entity14 , @entity15 , said : ' sometimes it was hard to come up with a good photo each day and i fell back on taking pictures of food or flowers			1
' i ended up setting a reminder on my phone so i would n’t forget to take one because maintaining it for a whole year was a challenge			0
' ms @entity6 , who is recovering from basal cell carcinoma , which is a superficial , non malignant form of skin cancer , said the task had been a welcome distraction			2
quirky : from indecently - attired mannequins , left , to a friend 's chicken who was given a towel down after getting drenched in the rain , her photo diary is a constant source of entertainment beautiful scene : @entity6 passes the time by capturing this gorgeous sunset warming : ill with the ' flu on december 30 last year , @entity6 posts a picture of her grandma 's remedy - honey and lemon tea , washed down with a couple of pills ' it ’s a project that has helped me come through some tough times that i have had over the last year and i enjoyed it so much that it ’s not something that i ’m ready to give up , ' she said			1
' by publishing the photos on the internet , i ’ve been able to share my world with other people and also see theirs which is a great experience			0
' it ’s nice to receive the feedback on the photos and i ca n’t believe that people care about my " boring life "			0
' i ’ve enjoyed taking pictures of more interesting things like food , with my recent trip to @entity96 and @entity97 standing out			0
' @entity99 ’s tagline is ‘ save your life ’ which i think it particularly fitting for me			0
' favourite haunt : @entity6 posted this picture on june 29 of this cavernous off licence , which she described as being like @entity107 's @entity106 gruesome : dental therapist @entity6 show 's off the unsavoury side of her job - a filter with the contents of patients ' mouths at the end of a long day apt : the tagline of the photosharing website she uses , @entity99 , is appropriately called ' save your life '			2
