by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 20 november 2013 whether it was jealousy or nervousness , this bird of prey 's antics almost ruined the big day for a bride and groom			0
@entity10 the barn owl was supposed to be flying the rings down the aisle for @entity13 and @entity14 but he decided to head for the rafters and refused to come down			1
mr @entity14 , 32 , tried to coax @entity10 down with a piece of chicken but he remained on his perch and it was only when his handler produced a dead chick that they managed to get him down			1
wedding chaos : @entity10 the @entity24 ( pictured ) was supposed to fly @entity25 and @entity14 's rings to the altar - but instead flew into the roof the couple , who got married in @entity30 , @entity31 , said @entity10 ’s performance helped calm their nerves and made sure the day was even more memorable			1
flown off : @entity10 the @entity36 owl sits on a rafter holding onto the rings and refuses to come down - despite efforts to tempt it with chicken @entity13 , 33 , said : ' it was absolutely hilarious			1
we wanted our wedding to be something different and this made sure it was			1
' if we ’d just had the owl delivering the rings then our guests would have talked about it for maybe five minutes			2
' because of what happened , people are still talking about it now			0
it really broke the ice and stopped everyone feeling nervous			0
' @entity14 , who hired @entity10 for £ 150 from a bird sanctuary , said : ' @entity13 is a big @entity59 fan and she wanted to incorporate this into the wedding day			1
' we ’ve also been to hundreds of weddings in the past through work so we wanted one with a difference			2
' the owl was at the back of the church with one of the people from the sanctuary			2
' none of the guests knew we had an owl as ringbearer so it was a surprise for them when , after we ’d said our vows , i picked up a glove and a piece of chicken			1
' i ’d been told to make a clicking sound with my mouth to call the owl over , but it was n’t coming			0
' eventually it started flying up the aisle , but then it veered off and almost flew in @entity13 ’s face			1
then it just flew up into the beams and stayed up there for about five minutes - only it felt a lot longer			0
' but we did n’t know how to get the bird down and the guy from the sanctuary pulled out a dead chick to coax it down			0
wedding chaos : the couple , who hired the owl as ringbearer , were relieved when the owl was eventually be tempted down from the rafter ' it was a bit of a surreal moment really , i did n’t expect to be holding a piece of chicken and trying to lure an owl down from the roof with a dead chick on my wedding day			1
' the guests were all really laughing			0
and it did stop me from feeling so nervous			0
' @entity13 added : ' i did n’t mind at all			2
it was still the best day of my life			0
everything else went to plan , this was just a little hiccup in my perfect day			0
' the couple , who have been together for seven years , have taken a long weekend to the @entity119 for their honeymoon			0
in september this year another owl held up a wedding after it flew to the roof of a church and fell asleep on a ledge			1
on that occasion the owl could not be coaxed down and so @entity129 , 46 , and @entity130 , 49 , had to get married using a back up set of rings			2
it remained perched high inside the 900 year - old @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 , for an hour after falling asleep			0
wedding day : @entity13 holds the owl outside the converted barn where they were holding their wedding ceremony in @entity30 , @entity31 in september this year @entity143 the owl flew to the rafters of a church with the rings still attached to his feet			1

@entity13 and @entity14 hired the owl as ringbearer because they wanted a wedding ceremony that was a ' bit different '
@entity14 , 32 , was forced to use chicken to try and tempt it down
the owl was eventually coaxed down from the roof beam and the wedding went *ahead* as planned
