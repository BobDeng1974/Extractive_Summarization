and after that win , the self - proclaimed ' small town guy ' had a familiar subject on his mind : @entity5			1

only a handful of players have won more than one @entity38 title , including the likes of @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , but @entity2 was not about to accept the label of an elite player			1
' no , no , ' @entity2 said			2
' again , i just got lucky enough to have two green jackets			2
i 'm just trying to keep my tour card every year and if people say that i 'm a good player , that 's great			0
' i 'm trying to play golf for a living			0
i 'm not trying to play golf for everybody to tell me how great i am or i 'm one of the greats of the game			0
i play golf because i love it , i love the game , i want to grow the game			0
the game has brought me everything that i 've ever owned in my life			0
' @entity2 crucially matched @entity19 's birdies on the fourth and sixth - the former after @entity19 had holed out from a greenside bunker , but felt his birdies on the eighth and ninth were vital			1
emotional : tears roll down @entity2 's cheeks as he holds @entity25 following his spectacular win sunday good luck charm : the couple adopted @entity25 , now 2 , just weeks before @entity2 won the masters in 2012 by @entity110 's side : @entity25 held on tightly to his champion dad as @entity2 thanked fans after the game ' eight and nine were really the turning point where momentum kind of went my way , ' he added			1
' then the group in front of us and other groups , you could just tell , just nobody really caught fire			0
there was n't too many birdies after number 10 i do n't think			0
' i do n't remember the last few holes , i just remember hanging on , making pars			0
somehow i did and walking up 18 was a little easier this time			0
' @entity2 , who beat @entity131 in a play - off two years ago , added : ' this one is a lot different			1
the first one is almost like i lucked into it , this was a lot of hard work and dedication and i got back the green jacket after giving it away last year			2
' as defending champion last year , @entity2 presented the green jacket to then - winner @entity142			1
on sunday the roles were reversed			2
@entity144 : @entity2 is presented with his green jacket by 2013 winner @entity142 hugging it out : @entity2 embraces caddie @entity147 after clinching victory ' i told @entity142 we should just keep switching it back and forth , ' @entity2 joked			1
as well as sharing his @entity152 on @entity10 , @entity2 took a moment to thank his fans online after his win			1
i ca n't believe i have another @entity158 green jacket ! ' he wrote on @entity10			2
' i want to thank everyone for the support , encouraging words & congrats that have poured in this week ! i feel incredibly blessed # awesomefans			0
' @entity19 , who was looking to become the youngest ever @entity38 champion , carded a closing 72 to share second place with @entity168 's @entity167			2
strong contender : @entity19 , 20 , was set to be the youngest masters winner until @entity2 pushed ahead disappointment : but @entity19 , from @entity172 , @entity173 , struggled on the back nine and missed out on the jacket ' it was so much fun , even if i did not show it on the back nine , ' he said			1
' although it stings right now i will be back and i ca n't wait to be back			0
that 's what 's on my mind because it 's tough being in this position			0
' i 've worked my whole life to lead in the masters on sunday , i had it in my hands and could have gone forward with it and did n't quite make the putts and that 's what it came down to			2
' i wanted to get into contention and that 's what happened but i can take a lot of positives away			0
my game held up and i feel like am ready to win a major			2
it 's just a matter of time and maybe a little bit of course knowledge			0
' ultimately hats off to him			0
he 's a deserving @entity38 champion this year			0
he played some incredible golf to make his pars down the stretch			0
