the mad set of @entity3 supporters to descend on north @entity4 have arrived in their thousands , ready to show @entity6 exactly what @entity8 football ought to feel like			1
kick - off : thursday october 2 , 8.05pm tv : @entity12 / @entity11			2
the flock of banners , flares and unified war cries in that pocket of @entity18 should make it a night to savour			2
the travelling @entity20 are not @entity21 , @entity22 or fc sheriff – they have rocked up for points and bring a squad capable of doing some serious damage			0
that ’s exactly why @entity6 should treat this as a @entity30 dress rehearsal			2
@entity31 will lead the line with former @entity34 midfielder @entity33 pulling strings behind him			1
it should pose quite a test , serving as a barometer to how far @entity6 have come and the extent to which they still have to go under @entity41			1
@entity41 faces his first real test in the @entity43 when @entity6 face @entity3 @entity31 is yet to open his account for the @entity20 side but could pose a big threat to @entity6 on thursday there is a bedding in process with the new manager at the helm – spurs play in a different fashion to the designs laid out by @entity55 before he was unceremoniously dumped – and it will take a period of time before the @entity58 cracks the problems to have blighted the club for the past three years			1
@entity41 is on his way to doing so , but @entity63 ’s @entity30 target looks to be a struggle in terms of qualifying domestically			2
while they have the ability to finish in the top four , history suggests they wo n’t			0
@entity72 has impressed for @entity6 this season bagging four goals in six appearances so far that means the road to @entity77 brings added importance			1
direct qualification into the continent ’s premier competition by winning the secondary event should see @entity6 take this very seriously indeed			1
follow all the latest # @entity43 action on : - @entity86 - @entity85 - @entity88 - @entity87 - website - @entity89 besiktas offer an authentic alternative to @entity30 football			1
it is an evening whereby @entity6 should be testing themselves to beat a main rival in the group and lay down a marker , but also having to play the situation too			1
you come up against @entity99 , his touchline entourage and thousands of baying travellers			0
@entity99 ’s side worried @entity34 in august and should cause problems ; other than the 1 - 0 second leg defeat at the @entity105 they are unbeaten this season			2
@entity107 scores the only goal of the game as @entity6 beat @entity110 at the @entity111 in 2011 @entity112 caps off a night to remember for @entity6 as they beat @entity113 3 - 1 in november 2010 but the most important factor to this is the atmosphere , the sense of meaning			1
@entity6 will not turn up , win 3 - 0 with little bother and go home			1
besiktas are loud , proud and create an intimidating air wherever they play			0
their supporters will expect to offer more than @entity124 managed at the @entity105 on wednesday			0
the intensity should replicate the big @entity8 nights of 2010			1
@entity6 fans will remember @entity113 3 - 1 under the lights and with a ferocious full house			1
@entity110 in the last - 16 the year after too			2
they have floundered for too long since then - bought badly while chopping and changing			0
now they are ready to settle			0
and the big games suit the club , according to @entity134			0
‘ if we play the same way we did at @entity34 , we should have no problems , but we need to repeat that			0
we have set the tone , ’ he said			0
it ’s high time that @entity63 found a way back into the @entity30			0
there wo n’t be a better opportunity to set that tone than against @entity3 .			0

@entity6 play @entity3 in the @entity43 on thursday
the north @entity4 side will be hoping to replicate memorable @entity8 nights of the past at @entity18
