by @entity0 published : 03:18 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 04:35 est , 2 april 2012 new doctors will be put off from providing abortion services after recent pro-life protests at clinics around the @entity6 , medical providers have warned			1
activists from groups such as ' @entity9 ' have been holding daily prayer vigils outside clinics run by the @entity12 in @entity13			1
although the group claim their protests are peaceful some have accused them of intimidation			0
last month one woman complained she was filmed leaving a @entity12 clinic			1
a prayer vigil is held outside a @entity12 clinic in @entity22 , @entity13 : the @entity24 religious group has been criticised by pro-choice campaigners of intimidating women abortion providers said trainee medics will also be put off from training as the service has recently come under intense political scrutiny			2
a spokesman for the @entity12 said : ' abortion is a vital yet stigmatised area of women 's healthcare which few doctors train in			1
' the current politicisation of abortion provision is likely to make it even harder to recruit a future generation of abortion doctors who are prepared to provide the care that a third of women will need in the course of their lifetimes			1
' the government recently ordered an inspection of 250 clinics in @entity52 over fears as many as 20 per cent of them were pre-signing consent forms for terminations			2
inspectors had discovered that some doctors were signing consent forms allowing women to undergo abortions without knowing anything about their circumstances or why they wanted the procedure			2
one doctor from @entity68 was even filmed agreeing to alter paperwork to conceal the fact he had agreed to abort a woman 's baby because she did n't want a girl			0
dr @entity75 has since been suspended by the @entity76			0
above board ? the government launched spot checks at 250 clinics over fears they were not following strict guidelines the subsequent spot checks by the @entity83 revealed that at least 50 clinics were not complying with the official guidelines			0
in some clinics inspectors found that doctors had signed piles of consent forms without knowing anything of the circumstances of the women involved			2
by law , a woman can only undergo an abortion once two doctors have signed a form declaring that continuing with the pregnancy would put her physical and mental health at risk			0
a @entity102 spokesman confirmed that doctors could face jail for breaching the @entity66			0
however , pro-choice campaigners said the majority of providers abided by the rules and felt ' under siege ' and prey to a ' political witch - hunt			0
' @entity112 said none of its 19 units was found to have breached the rules , while @entity12 said that , to the best of its knowledge , none of its clinics were involved			1
dr @entity121 , medical director of @entity112 , which has @entity124 contracts to provide terminations like the @entity12 said it was now challenging to find doctors willing to work in termination services and to navigate past angry protestors every day			1
meanwhile dr @entity130 , clinical director with @entity131 and @entity132 and @entity133 , told @entity134 : ' i really do think that the question has to be asked : what impact is this increasingly negative politicisation going to have on future providers of abortion care ? ' is it going to put doctors and nurses off becoming involved in this work ? '			0

the @entity12 and @entity112 both have contracts to provide terminations on the @entity124
both *organisations* have warned it is already difficult to recruit necessary doctors
