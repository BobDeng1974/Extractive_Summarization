by @entity0 from laptops to tablet computers , we have no shortage of gadgets to help us keep track of our lives			0
if you really want to remember something , however , it may be best to just pick up an old - fashioned pen and some paper			2
a study has found that when it comes to recalling things we have been told , writing notes by hand is more effective than typing			1
old faithful : the @entity21 study found that taking notes by hand aided memory more than high - tech solutions @entity27 psychologists carried out tests of how well students retained information after a lecture			1
they found those who wrote their notes in longhand had better understood the concepts they had been taught			2
@entity36 , who led the study at @entity21 , said students who had used a pen could recall more information later – whether or not they were given a chance to re-read their notes			1
she added : ‘ our findings suggest that even when laptops are used as intended – and not for buying things on @entity44 during class – they may still be harming academic performance			0
’ first , 65 students watched recorded lectures armed either with a pen or a laptop			2
half an hour later , they were given a series of factual - recall and comprehension questions based on the talk they had heard			0
the study , published in the journal @entity58 , found computer users performed significantly worse on the conceptual questions			1
those who had used a laptop had taken nearly twice as many notes			0
crucially , however , they were far more prone to ‘ mindlessly ’ transcribing the lecture .			0

study finds that writing notes by hand is best way to remember *details*
@entity27 *scientists* at @entity21 tested students watching a lecture
did *n't* matter whether they were given a chance to look over their notes
those who had taken notes with a computer fared significantly worse
