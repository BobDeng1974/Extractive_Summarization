members of the public are being asked to design the ' tails ' side of the new £ 1 coin in a nationwide art competition			1
chancellor @entity6 said the design will be ' in millions of people 's pockets and purses ' when the coin is launched in 2017			1
the new coin will be the same shape as the 12 - sided threepenny or ' thrupenny ' bit , which was in circulation until 1971 , and officials say designers claim the new coin will be the hardest to copy in the world			1
the @entity31 estimates that an astonishing 45million £ 1 coins – 3 per cent of the total – are fake			2
the figure is as high as 6 per cent in some parts of the @entity36 and two million counterfeits are removed from circulation every year			2
the competition to design the ' tails ' side of the coin is open to anyone , irrespective of how old they are or where they are from , the @entity39 said			1
all entries must be submitted by october 30			1
entrants are being asked to ' show what @entity36 or ' @entity52 ' means , drawing on all of the qualities and quirks that make our nation unique '			0
mr @entity6 said : ' today we 're asking people across the @entity36 to help us design the new £ 1 coin			1
chancellor @entity6 said he wanted the design to capture @entity52 ' think about your favourite landmark , or a great @entity36 achievement or a symbol from our @entity65			2
' the winning design will be in millions of people 's pockets and purses			1
it 'll be heads you win ; tails , it 's your design			2
' the £ 1 coin has been in use since 1983 – much longer than the normal life cycle for legal tender of its value – and 1.5billion were in circulation as of march 2013			0
the outdated technology used to make the coin leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters			0
its replacement will be roughly the same size with security features including bi-metallic construction , the 12 - sided design and the use of @entity92 – integrated @entity93			1
this means an additive is built into coins which can be authenticated by high - speed scanners			0
the technology will allow vending machines to spot fakes much more easily			0
the competition is open to anyone who wishes to enter , irrespective of how old they are or where they are from , the @entity39 said			0
all entries must be submitted by october 30			1
according to the rules of the competition , the denomination ' one pound ' must appear as part of the overall design but it is left up to the designer precisely where this is placed			0
designs must not include a recognisable likeness of a known person , whether living or dead and designs must be the entrant 's own work			0
artworks can be submitted in pencil , ink , paint or using computer drawing or design software , but three dimensional entries can not be entered			2
all designs need to be presented on a template which can be downloaded from the @entity130 's website			0
people can enter more than one design if they wish , provided the entry is completed on the template , alongside a unique reference code which will be used to track the entry			0
giving tips to inspire competition entrants on its website , the @entity31 says designs should ' symbolise the @entity36 in a clear and unambiguous way '			1
it says : ' whatever you choose as your inspiration , it must be readily understood to represent @entity36			0
' think of symbols , heraldry , words , aspects of the natural world , man - made structures such as buildings and monuments , @entity36 achievements , whether social , political or cultural , and @entity36 institutions			2
