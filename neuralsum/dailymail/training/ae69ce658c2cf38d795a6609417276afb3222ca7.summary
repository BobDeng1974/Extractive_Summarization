by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 10:50 est , 14 january 2014 a young woman who was bullied because her severe underbite can now smile for the first time			1
@entity5 , 25 , from @entity6 , was teased throughout her teenage years because she could not smile			1
her severe underbite - which even stopped her eating properly - was so bad she had to have seven teeth removed when she was 13 and had to wear a brace until she was 23			1
@entity10 , 25 , is now able to smile for the first time ( right ) after having surgery to correct her severe underbite ( left )			1
before the operation , she was in constant pain , could n't eat normally and could n't smile but now , ms @entity5 has finally had her condition corrected after more than a decade of pain and misery			1
when she was 11 , a dentist first noticed a problem with the shape of her face			2
ms @entity5 believes the development of the bones in her face was affected by the fact she was delivered using forceps			1
she underwent her first jaw and face surgery in august 2011 - the eight - hour op involved rotating her bottom jaw 9mm and moving it back towards her face			1
the top jaw was pushed 2mm forward and 2mm to the side and finally her jaw was then held in place with titanium plates and screws			2
after a further operation in december 2012 to remove the screws , ms @entity5 is now almost completely recovered from her ordeal			1
ms @entity5 ( pictured before her operation ) was bullied throughout her teenage years because she always looked sad			1
she says people called her ' long face ' and ' freak ' and told her she looked miserable ms @entity5 ( pictured after her surgery ) said : ' being able to smile now , and show people that i 'm happy , has been life changing			1
i still suffer from some numbness and pain , but it 's a big improvement ' the full - time blogger said : ‘ before the first surgery , my natural face just looked a bit sad			1
people used to tell me to cheer up and that i was miserable - but i was n’t			2
‘ it was really hard to deal with , especially as a teenager , i felt like people did n’t see the real me , they just saw my face			0
‘ i was called a freak and long face , it was awful			0
the surgery was difficult and it ’s been painful , but the difference is incredible			2
‘ being able to smile now , and show people that i ’m happy , has been life changing			2
‘ i still suffer from some numbness and pain , but it ’s a big improvement , and the fact that i ’ll now be able to eat correctly , is a huge relief			2
’ ms @entity5 ( pictured in hospital after her second operation ) underwent her first jaw and face surgery in august 2011 - the eight - hour op involved rotating her bottom jaw 9mm and moving it back towards her face ms @entity5 ( pictured in hospital after her second operation ) had further surgery in december 2012 to remove the screws from her face and she is now almost completely recovered ms @entity5 said her face was not noticeably different until she reached the age of 11 when concerns were raised by a dentist about the shape of her face			1
she said : ‘ i was referred to a hospital where i was eventually diagnosed with the condition and told that i ’d need major facial surgery when i was older			2
about 4,000 such procedures are performed in the @entity89 every year , mr @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , told @entity90			0
a severe underbite can be caused by either the upper jaw growing too much , the lower jaw not growing enough , or a combination of the two			1
it is most commonly caused by the lower jaw not growing enough , added mr @entity97 , who works at @entity98 and the @entity99			1
this can be surgically corrected by bringing the lower jaw forward			0
surgeons achieve this by cutting through the jaw bone obliquely from inside the mouth and then sliding the jaw forward			0
sometimes the upper jaw has grown too much and needs to be brought back			0
this procedure involves cutting out a segment from the middle of the upper jaw and then removing it and rejoining the bone			0
the surgery is funded by the @entity113 and takes about two hours			0
after the operation , most patients remain in hospital for one night and then need about two weeks off school or work to recover			0
they have to eat soft food for up to a month			0
‘ suddenly i started looking at myself differently , and noticed all these flaws			0
‘ the older i got , and as my face grew , it became more asymmetrical with one side longer than the other			0
‘ it was just awful - sometimes i could n’t speak or eat properly - i was very self - conscious			2
’ her journey to correct her underbite was tough , seven of her teeth had to be removed when she was just 13 and she had to wear a brace until she was 23 - when her jaw had stopped growing			1
she said : ‘ at 22 i started to develop severe facial pain - even a strong gust of wind across my face left me in agony			1
‘ i could n’t eat , sleep or function on a day to day basis , and could n’t concentrate on my studies at university			0
‘ it was n’t until my jaw had stopped growing , and my teeth were in the right position , that i could finally have the operation			1
‘ when i was finally told i could have it i was thrilled , but it was scary at the same time			0
i knew i would end up looking totally different , and i did n’t really know how to prepare myself for that			0
‘ there are also major risks involved that might have left me with facial numbness and possibly would have made my debilitating pain worse - it was terrifying			2
’ three days after her surgery , ms @entity5 looked in a mirror for the very first time			1
she said : ‘ when i first saw my face i hated it - i was swollen and i just looked like a blown up bowling ball			2
‘ it was n’t until six months later when i looked at myself , when the swelling had gone down , that i suddenly realised how different i looked			0
ms @entity5 ( pictured after surgery ) said : ' when i first saw my face i hated it - i was swollen and i just looked like a blown up bowling ball			1
it was n't until six months later that i suddenly realised how different i looked ' ms @entity5 ( pictured after her surgery ) says having the operation was terrifying as she knew she could be left with numbness in her face or with even more pain than she already had ms @entity5 ( pictured applying an ice pack to her jaw after surgery ) says that after years of seeing flaws in her face she can finally see it as she thinks it should always have been ‘ after years of picking out flaws , it was hard at first to see that my face was how it always should have been			1
‘ i also had to learn how to talk and chew again which was difficult			0
‘ but my face was so symmetrical - it was a big confidence boost			0
being able to smile , and show when i ’m happy , is something i ’ll never take for granted			0
’ she added : ‘ i ’m working on my confidence , and i ’m slowly starting to feel like i have a new lease of life			2
ms @entity5 ( pictured before her surgery ) had to learn to eat and talk again after her surgery ms @entity5 ( pictured before her operation ) says she is now working on her confidence and that she feels like she has been given a new lease of life ‘ the biggest thing i notice is how differently people treat me now - which is awful when you think about it			1
‘ people are much nicer to me , and they listen to me when i speak , rather than just stare at my face			0
i ’m seen as more approachable			0
’ ms @entity5 has now started a blog which details her journey , in the hope of helping other people and outlining the possible risks of this type of surgery			1
she said : ‘ i started my blog just after my final surgery , as i wanted to reach out to other patients			0
‘ there ’s not enough information out there about this kind of surgery , especially for young people , and i wanted to help			0
ms @entity5 ( pictured before her surgery ) says that since her operation people talk to her more kindly and think she is more approachable			1
she says they also stare at her face less than they used to ms @entity5 ( pictured in hospital after her second operation ) is now writing a blog about her experiences ‘ a lot of people think that this kind of surgery is simply for cosmetic reasons but it really is n’t - it has allowed me to be able to live normally			1
‘ i can eat properly and my risk of arthritis has been reduced - my blog allows me to give people this information			2
‘ it ’s been a real privilege to talk to other people about what they ’ve gone through , and it ’s been a big help in my recovery too			0

@entity5 was first told she had an underbite when she was 11
she had to have seven teeth removed when she was just 13 and she had to wear a brace until she was 23 and her jaw had stopped growing
her underbite was so severe she was unable to eat normally and always looked *unhappy* - her jaw also caused her severe pain
in august 2011 she had an eight hour operation to *reposition* her jaw
she had more surgery in december 2012 to remove the screws from her jaw
she has now recovered and says she feels like she has a new lease of life
