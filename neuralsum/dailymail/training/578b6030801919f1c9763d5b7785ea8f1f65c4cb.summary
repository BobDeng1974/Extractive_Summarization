the world ’s population will reach almost eleven billion by the end of the century because of soaring birth rates in @entity4 , according to new research			1
the latest projection is about 800 million - eight percent - more than a previous @entity8 forecast of 10.1 billion issued in 2011			1
researchers had expected fertility on the poorest continent where a woman will give birth to an average of 5.2 children in her lifetime , to fall more quickly than it has			1
soaring : the world ¿ s population will reach almost eleven billion by the end of the century because of soaring birth rates in @entity4 , according to new research the current @entity4 population is about 1.1 billion and it is now expected to reach 4.2 billion , nearly a fourfold increase , by 2100			1
professor @entity22 , of the @entity23 , said : ' the fertility decline in @entity4 has slowed down or stalled to a larger extent than we previously predicted , and as a result the @entity4 population will go up			1
' a study last year found shifting population trends mean one in three children born by 2050 will be @entity4			2
increasing : the current @entity4 population is about 1.1 billion and it is now expected to reach 4.2 billion , nearly a fourfold increase , by 2100 the new estimates are based on better statistical methods developed by @entity36 and colleagues using finely tuned data that anticipate the life expectancies			1
in other areas of the world , fewer major population changes are expected			2
@entity43 may see a small decline because of fertility continuing below replacement level , and other nations around the globe may see modest increases due to longer life expectancies , said prof @entity22			0
but there is no end in sight for the increase of world population , yet the topic has gone off the agenda in favour of other pressing global issues including poverty and climate change			0
with famine recently returning to the @entity64 , it is feared a continent already feeling the pain of climate change will be unable to produce enough food or more importantly , have enough water , to meet its needs			0
@entity4 is growing fast because it is young			2
the top 10 youngest populations in the world are all from the continent , led by @entity75 with an estimated 48.9 per cent below the age of 14 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
many will have big families , knowing despite ongoing efforts to combat malnutrition and @entity83 , there is a strong risk many of their children will die			0
prof @entity22 said : ' these new findings show that we need to renew policies , such as increasing access to family planning and expanding education for girls , to address rapid population growth in @entity4			2
' the @entity8 gives high and low variants of its projections , assuming women have an average of half a child more or less than the best projection			1
that leaves a large uncertainty , from 7 billion to nearly 17 billion , in the range for potential world population			0
' our probability intervals are much tighter , ranging from 9 billion to 13 billion in 2100 , ' added prof @entity22			0
the global population reached 7 billion in 2011 , having passed 6 billion in 1999 .			0

projection is 800 million more than a previous @entity8 forecast of 10.1 billion
researchers had expected fertility in @entity4 to more fall quickly
