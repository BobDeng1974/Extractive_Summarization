@entity2 was set to succeed @entity10 as skipper at @entity12 under @entity13 but @entity15 ’s appointment led to suggestions that he would give the armband to his @entity19 captain @entity18 instead			1
however , @entity2 was chosen to lead @entity5 for the first time under the @entity21 at the @entity22 in @entity23 , and afterwards @entity15 hinted that he would prefer to give the job to an @entity25			1
‘ i am always looking for opportunities to give players the captain ’s armband			2
@entity2 played 90 minutes for the first time			1
@entity41 had already done it two times , then he was the captain , and @entity44 because he also had 90 minutes			2

‘ he is a man who is always a winner , ’ added the @entity5 boss			1
‘ you saw in the @entity55 when the award went to @entity54 it is not always like that			2
it is deserved because he scored a lot of goals and made assists			1
the judges are always looking for that			2
‘ but we have also defended very well and without defence we can not score			2
a lot of my defenders could have been @entity45 of this tournament			0
main man : @entity2 was named @entity45 of the tournament after scoring five goals winning feeling : @entity2 and @entity41 with the @entity9 after @entity5 's win in @entity23 ‘ but we have also defended very well and without defence we can not score			1
a lot of my defenders could have been @entity45 of this tournament			0
‘ his was a wonderful goal and very important for him , i believe			0
when you see the technique and what he did to push the ball under the legs of the opponent and into the bottom corner			0
it was a great cross by @entity87 of course – it was a very good attack			0
’ @entity15 played down the importance of lifting the @entity9 after finishing the tour unbeaten , but acknowledged that beating @entity7 would delight their fans			1
asked the value of winning the tournament , he replied : ‘ nothing			0
it ’s nice for the fans in the @entity97 but also at home that we beat @entity7			1
it ’s not our favourite opponent i think for @entity5 fans			1
we have given a lot of pleasure to these fans and that is very important			0
@entity106 wants reinforcements in front : @entity109 scored to put @entity5 ahead as @entity15 's side ended their tour unbeaten game over : @entity113 celebrates scoring a third to put the game beyond @entity7 ‘ of course it is better to win in pre-season than to lose			1
the most important game is @entity119 at home in the first game , that ’s the one we have to win			0
‘ it ’s better to win and maybe you have noticed in the media that first we beat @entity126 and then @entity127 and then @entity128			0
