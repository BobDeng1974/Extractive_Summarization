the @entity19 had drunk ten bottles of @entity21 before posting the comment , a court heard today			2
although @entity0 claims not to be ‘ actively racist ’ , the defence said he did not know better as he had grown up in a racist family where he was taught to feel adverse towards non-white people			1
he made the comment about three - year - old @entity9 whose body was found in @entity13 on january 17 , one day after he was reported missing from his home in the @entity31 area of @entity32			1
a national appeal following his disappearance saw hundreds of people join police , coastguards and expert rescue teams to search for him			0
his mother , @entity39 , 33 , has been charged with his murder			0
@entity0 pleaded guilty last month to sending by public electronic communications network a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent , obscene or menacing character			1
a judge today branded @entity0 ’s comments ‘ despicable ’ and ‘ appalling ’ and handed the guardsman a 16 week suspended prison sentence			1
@entity49 , prosecuting , told @entity50 that @entity51 , who is based at @entity53 , @entity54 , had become concerned for the well - being of his family and contacted police after his comment went viral			2
ms @entity49 said that in interview , he told police he had attended @entity61 marches in the past and had a racist background			2
she added that he also made comments about people of @entity67 backgrounds			0
offensive : the @entity7 status , posted the day after @entity9 's body was found in @entity13 , @entity14 , was branded ' disgusting ' by a judge ms @entity49 said : ‘ he said that he is from a racist background but not actively racist , he stated that if he knew the consequences he would n’t have posted the comments			1
’ @entity75 , defending , said that the defendant , who was wearing full ceremonial uniform in his profile picture , deleted the comment and his @entity7 account after he realised the impact of it , which had led to him receiving death threats			1
she said : ‘ he has grown up in a racist family , his father and grandfather were actively racist			1
he has been brought up not to like people of a different race and that is all he has known until being 19 years old and recently joining the @entity89			2
‘ in the small community of @entity11 if he was to make such a comment , he does n’t think it would get the same reaction in that community , which gives an idea of the extent of the racism in that small community			2
’ she added : ‘ he has gone from a very sheltered insular background growing up to the professional @entity89 job he has entered into			0
his maturity has n’t caught up with his job role otherwise he would know as an ambassador for the country he can never say what he has said			0
’ speaking in support of @entity51 , his platoon commander captain @entity107 said that the defendant had spent the past eight weeks under curfew with limited contact with his colleagues and he had been banned from accessing his mobile phone and the internet			0
tragedy : @entity9 , whose disappearance became nationwide news after he was reported missing from his home in @entity32 , was found dead in @entity13 on january 17 this year he said : ‘ prior to this incident @entity0 did have a clean slate within the @entity89 and was following a promising career as a guardsman			1
‘ since the incident he has been kept in camp for eight weeks which in itself is a bit of a punishment			0
i have noticed him showing signs of remorse , he does truly regret what he has done			0
’ he said the @entity89 would consider @entity51 ’s position in its ranks following the sentencing			0
sentencing @entity51 to a 16 - week prison sentence suspended for 18 months and 250 hours community service , district judge @entity134 said : ‘ everybody has said what a despicable thing this was to do and i agree wholeheartedly			2
not ' actively racist ' : the court heard that @entity51 had grown up in a racist family and that they had taught him the values expressed in his @entity7 comment ‘ those comments were in respect of a young child who had so tragically lost his life and in terms of the impact on the wider members of the family and also the impact it made across the nation - people were appalled at seeing this prejudice , completely unjustified , cruel and disrespectful			1
’ he said that he was sparing the defendant a jail sentence in a bid to give him a chance to learn from his actions which he said had been a result of him being ‘ brain - washed ’ by propaganda and by his upbringing			2
he added that @entity0 had brought disgrace upon the @entity89			1
he said : ‘ to post this @entity7 entry with you standing there in your full ceremonial uniform was a great disgrace and brought the @entity89 into tremendous disrepute			1
’ @entity0 was also ordered to pay £ 85 court costs and a £ 80 victim surcharge and complete a 12 - month supervision order which would include , diversity awareness and prejudice training as well as alcohol awareness			2
speaking after the hearing , @entity179 , chief prosecutor for the @entity180 , said : ‘ the disappearance and the tragic discovery of the body of the little boy shocked many of us and it is therefore very difficult to understand how a 19 - year - old is capable of making such cruel and disrespectful comments			0
‘ @entity50 heard today how , as soon as @entity51 posted this message he and his family received death threats			0
the chain of command of @entity51 ’s regiment was alerted and advised him to contact @entity196			0
‘ whilst he was interviewed by @entity196 officers , @entity0 explained how he shared extreme rightwing ideology and that being racist was his opinion and that he did not think that his comments were bad			1
‘ he also said to them that he only regretted the backlash it caused to his family			0
‘ the dpp ’s guidance on cases involving social media makes clear that the threshold for prosecuting these cases is high and must be balanced against the right to freedom of speech			0
‘ however , where there is sufficient evidence for this threshold to be met , and it is in the public interest to do so , we will vigorously prosecute			0
