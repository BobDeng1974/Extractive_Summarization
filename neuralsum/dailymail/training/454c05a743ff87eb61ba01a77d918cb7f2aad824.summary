the prime minister cautioned it would take time to secure mr @entity14 ’s return , but said president @entity0 was committed to closing the controversial detention camp established by @entity21 before leaving office in 2016			1
‘ obviously i ’ve raised this case in the past			0
i know that the policy of the @entity11 government to close @entity4 , ’ the prime minister said			0
@entity14 , pictured left , and again right with his children , is the only remaining @entity3 resident imprisoned at @entity4 ‘ so i think there is every opportunity ... i hope to over time make some progress			1
’ @entity34 , spokeswoman for the @entity35 , said : ‘ prime minister @entity5 raised this case with the president , and the president told him that he understands why this case is of great interest to the prime minister and the @entity3 people			2
the president committed to the prime minister that we will prioritise this case , while making sure any action taken is consistent with our national security			0
’ chances of an announcement of an intention to release mr @entity14 this week have been hampered by attempts by @entity54 senators to limit releases from @entity4			2
they have objected to the accelerated pace of releases from the @entity60 facility in recent months , particularly in the light of terrorist attacks in @entity63			0
the hold - up in mr @entity14 ’s release is understood to be because @entity11 authorities have cleared him for transfer to @entity68 , but not the @entity3 , despite him being resident in this country			1
@entity3 officials , however , are seeking to persuade the @entity11 that they can address any concerns about a return to @entity73			2
mr @entity5 had been pressed to raise mr @entity14 ’s case by mps from across the political spectrum , including former @entity78 shadow home secretary @entity77 , @entity80 mp and former home office minister @entity81 , and @entity83 mp @entity82			2
celebrity backers of a campaign to secure his release include @entity87 of @entity88 , tv presenter @entity89 and her singer daughter @entity90 , and the actress @entity91			0

he has been held at the jail without charge for 13 years mr @entity14 , who lived in south @entity73 with his wife and four children , was picked up in @entity102 in 2002 and accused of being an ally of @entity104 , a claim he strenuously denies			1
though he has never faced any charge , he has been held by the @entity11 for 13 years			0
the @entity107 revealed last week that mr @entity5 intended to raise mr @entity14 ’s plight in talks with president @entity0 at the @entity8			1
mr @entity5 sought to reassure the @entity11 president about @entity3 ’s readiness to have mr @entity14 back , having already accepted 14 former @entity4 residents – more than the whole of the rest of @entity115			1
‘ the prime minister understands that the closure of @entity4 is a personal priority for the president			0
it is something we have worked together on , ’ said one senior government source			0
‘ they understand the importance of this last case to @entity3			0
we now expect them to look at those cleared for transfer and how to get on with that			0
’ @entity131 of @entity132 , who is one of mr @entity14 ’s lawyers , said : ‘ these are prisoners who have never been charged with a crime or tried , and whom the @entity11 has long determined pose no threat to anyone			2

president @entity0 will give extra consideration to plight of @entity14
mr @entity14 , who lived in south @entity73 , is imprisoned in @entity4
he is the only @entity3 resident to remain *locked* up in the *notorious* prison
