@entity2 , a senior economist at @entity1 , said the much - hailed @entity4 fast - food ban did little to reshape the retail food landscape in the targeted area the @entity9 fast - food ban did not decrease obesity in poor neighborhoods because residents found unhealthy food at restaurants in strip malls and convenience stores instead , a new study has found			1
in 2008 , a dietary ordinance targeted a 32 - square - mile area south of @entity19 that struggles with high obesity rates and other health problems			1
the ban went into effect in @entity9 and restricted the opening or expansion of standalone fast - food restaurants			1
however , the law , believed to be the first effort of its kind by a major city to improve public health , did not ban new fast food restaurants in strip malls			1
this made it possible for unhealthy food to continue making its way into the low - income neighborhoods			2
@entity2 , a senior economist at @entity1 and lead author of the study , said findings should not come as a surprise , as most food outlets in the area are small food stores or restaurants that have limited seating and were not affected by the policy			1
in the study , which was published in the @entity49 journal , @entity2 found that in the targeted area , free - standing restaurants were rare to begin with and no new ones have opened since the ordinance took effect			1
these standalone fast - food restaurants are outnumbered by restaurants in strip malls and small food stores , such as convenience stores , which were not restricted by the ban , according to @entity60			1
@entity1 researchers reviewed permits issued by the @entity63 , which inspects food outlets			2
larger fast - food chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in @entity9 from 2008 to 2012			1
almost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food			1
obesity rates in @entity9 grew by 12 per cent despite a much - hailed three - year ban on stand - alone fast - food restaurants , a new study has found findings showed that before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008 , 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county			1
but three years on , instead of the law curbing weight gain , the opposite trend took force as obesity rates grew by 12 per cent in @entity9			2
' the @entity9 fast food ban may have symbolic value , but it has had no measurable impact in improving diets or reducing obesity , ' said @entity2			1
the study also revealed that obesity rates following the ban have been significantly larger in @entity9 compared to other parts of the city			1
in 2011 , 75 per cent of @entity9 residents reported being overweight or obese , while rates elsewhere only increased by one per cent			2
however , a positive development was a drop in soft drink consumption since 2007 , which also occurred across the city			0
' the one bright spot we found is that soft drink consumption dropped , but the decrease was similar in all areas across @entity4 , ' said co-author of the study , @entity113 of the @entity114 , @entity115			0
' unfortunately , the rates of overweight and obesity increased and they increased fastest in the area subject to the fast - food ban			1
' before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008 , 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county standing outside a @entity127 's in the @entity129 neighborhood on wednesday , @entity126 lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes - he was not a fan of the fast food ban @entity134 , a professor from @entity114 , @entity115 said he was not surprised by @entity2 's observation and that the ban was ' too trivial '			1
however , @entity137 , a professor from @entity138 said the ban was not a trivial measure , and that setting limits could help prevent problems			0
he also said he was not surprised the ordinance was not effective			0
health experts said a single intervention would not reverse the obesity problem			0
people also have to exercise and make lifestyle changes , they said			0
' it 's not just about limiting unhealthy food , but increasing access to healthy food , ' @entity152 , a professor of public health at the @entity154 , @entity4 , who had no role in the study			2
researchers compared obesity rates in @entity9 and other parts of the county using surveys that asked residents to report their weight and eating habits			2
supporters said the ordinance worked because it prevented chains from opening new restaurants at major intersections with their own drive - thru windows and parking lots			2
they acknowledged it will take some time to see health gains but noted that the area has seen farmers markets and community gardens in recent years			0
' we never said this ordinance was the silver bullet ' to solving the obesity problem , said @entity179 of the @entity180			0
' as long as we can make sure people have more options , that 's the important thing			0
' @entity184 , who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast - food chains , said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers @entity2 has said changing aspects of food environment can impact diets and obesity , particularly when considering food prices			1
after analyzing data from the @entity195 and @entity196 , @entity2 learned in both cases that when healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables were cheaper , people at them more often as compared with unhealthy foods			0
city councilman @entity204 , who supported the zoning law , said he was hopeful that the area can attract more markets selling fresh food			2
the ordinance was opposed by the @entity210			0
spokeswoman @entity211 said the group had no comment on the @entity1 study			0
standing outside a @entity127 's in the @entity129 neighborhood on wednesday , @entity126 lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes			0
' i want to sit down and eat , but there 's no place to sit down and eat , ' said the retiree , who usually drives to another neighborhood to dine out			0
@entity126 said he 's hopeful that a planned light rail line will attract a variety of new eateries			0
@entity184 , who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast - food chains , said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers			1
' once people stop to eat here , they come back , ' said @entity184 , who opened simply @entity233 last year .			0
