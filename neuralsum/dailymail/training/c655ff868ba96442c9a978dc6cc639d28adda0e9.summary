@entity0 was repeatedly put on the spot yesterday over how far somebody confronted by a raider would be allowed to go under a new ‘ bash a burglar ’ law unveiled by his party			1
the prime minister – who recounted the ‘ terrible ’ experience of having his @entity9 stolen in a burglary – said he believed intruders gave up their rights when they entered another person ’s home			1
when pressed as to what this meant in practice , he said that the new law would not permit , for example , the stabbing of a burglar who had been knocked unconscious in a struggle			1
mr @entity0 told @entity38 : ‘ people need the certainty to know that unless they did something grossly disproportionate , as we ’re going to put it , then they are basically in the right			0
’ he added : ‘ and frankly when a burglar crosses your threshold and enters your home , we should worry less about their rights and worry more about the rights of the household , the home , the family whose privacy and whose place they are invading			1
’ he recalled how raiders once burgled his home then escaped in his car , telling @entity62 : ‘ i ’ve been burgled a couple of times when i lived in @entity65 , in @entity66			0
there was one occasion when i left the keys in my car and they loaded up my @entity9 and drove off			0
it is a horrible feeling when your house has been invaded			0
’ justice secretary @entity31 ’s announcement that he would change the law to allow the use of ‘ disproportionate force ’ against burglars in the heat of the moment delighted mps at the @entity82 conference yesterday			1
only the use of ‘ grossly disproportionate force ’ will remain outlawed			2
currently , householders are entitled to use only ‘ reasonable ’ force			2
campaign : calls for a change in the law gathered strength after @entity91 , pictured outside the @entity93 home where he shot two burlgars , was jailed in 2000 plans : @entity97 tells the @entity82 conference that victims will have a greater say in the justice system the plan was attacked by the civil liberties group @entity106 , whose director @entity107 said : ‘ terrified householders defending themselves are already protected , so the irresponsible announcement can only be designed to make people afraid or actually encourage vigilante execution			1
’ mr @entity31 also pledged that sex attackers and killers would be jailed for life in a new ‘ two strikes and you ’re out ’ policy			1
life terms will automatically go to anyone twice given jail terms of ten years or more for rape , sex crimes against children , serious @entity122 and terrorism offences , and ‘ causing or allowing the death of a child ’			1
the justice secretary said : ‘ everyone deserves a second chance			1
but those who commit the most serious offences can not be allowed to just go on and on causing harm , distress and injury			2
’ home secretary @entity97 also unveiled plans to allow crime victims to decide how the thug should be punished			2
they will be offered a menu of sanctions – such as ordering offenders to pay compensation or fix the damage they have caused			0
any offender who refuses to comply will face stiff action by the police or courts			0
mr @entity31 , who will also promise to toughen community punishments , will delight the @entity148 with his new law on burglars			1
it will mean someone who is confronted by a burglar and has reason to fear for their safety , or their family ’s safety and in the heat of the moment uses force that later seems ‘ disproportionate ’ will not be guilty of an offence			1
home secretary ... and unofficial minister for fashion : @entity97 's shoes on stage today rights : @entity170 and @entity171 , pictured , were confronted in their home by burglars this could include the use of lethal force			1
only force which is ‘ grossly ’ disproportionate will not be permitted			2
mr @entity31 said : ‘ being confronted by an intruder in your home is terrifying , and the public should be in no doubt that the law is on their side			1
that is why i am strengthening the current law			2
‘ householders who act instinctively and honestly in self - defence are crime victims and should be treated that way			0
‘ we need to dispel doubts in this area once and for all , and i am very pleased to be delivering on the pledge that we made in @entity195			1
’ the demands for change began when mr @entity91 was imprisoned for killing one burglar and wounding another who entered his @entity93 farm			0
no sympathy : judge @entity202 spoke out after a lawyer for one of the men who broke into the @entity207 ' remote farmhouse , pictured , asked for leniency more recent cases suggest prosecutors and judges have been giving greater weight to the legal right of householders to use ‘ reasonable force ’ to defend themselves			0
last month judge @entity202 spoke out after a lawyer demanded leniency for a criminal who , he said , had been hit with a shotgun by @entity221 at his home near @entity223 , @entity224 , in ‘ a form of summary justice ’			0
the judge replied : ‘ if you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun , that is the chance you take			0
you can not come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it			0
’ mr @entity31 ’s move follows changes made by his predecessor @entity238 , which removed a legal requirement for householders to retreat			1
guilty : burglars @entity244 , left , and @entity245 , who had a string of previous convictions , were both jailed after they were shot after breaking into the home of @entity221 in @entity249 , near @entity223 guidance for police has also been changed to encourage fewer arrests of those defending their home			0
mr @entity31 will also introduce measures to make sure every community sentence contains a proper punishment			2
they include a requirement to include a punitive element in every community order , a power to impose location monitoring and the removal of the £ 5,000 cap on compensation in the magistrates courts mr @entity31 said : ‘ we inherited a weak , “ soft - option ” programme from @entity270 , which saw offenders working only minimal hours or simply not completing their sentences			2
‘ yes , we should rehabilitate			0
but criminals also need to receive a proper punishment			0
' video : @entity0 says people need to be able to defend themselves ...			0

new laws could allow use of lethal force against criminals
the prime minister says homeowners could stab a burglar provided they are not unconscious
law changes meant to ' dispel doubts ' over right to fight intruders
justice secretary @entity31 to *reassure* homeowners over their rights
tough new ' two strikes ' rules will mean anyone committing two serious offences will be jailed for life
