first she was told she had breast cancer			1
then doctors explained that the treatment she needed to save her life might rob her of the chance of having children			2
for @entity9 , 32 at the time of the diagnosis and desperate to be a mother , the news was devastating			2
' i basically went outside into the street and i just screamed , ' she told @entity15			0
' it was just like all of a sudden , having children was n't an option for me			0
it was a very traumatic day			0
' @entity9 , 38 , was told she might not ever be able to have children when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 ms @entity9 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , had been prescribed weeks of chemotherapy			1
while the treatment destroys cancer cells it can also lead to infertility and early menopause in young women			1
but she was determined to do anything she could to increase her chances of having children and resorted to an egg retrieval procedure at an clinic in @entity37			0
@entity39 treatment , however , was not necessary			2
only six months after finishing chemotherapy , ms @entity9 was ecstatic to find she was naturally pregnant with a healthy baby boy			1
now mother to four - year - old @entity44 , she was one of the 256 young women with breast cancer around the world who participated in the @entity48			1
the study saw half the participants receive a dose of the drug goserelin alongside their standard chemotherapy treatment , while the other half received their cancer treatment without			1
' i had to have my chemotherapy every three weeks for six rounds			2
i got to the fourth week and i 'd already had enough , ' ms @entity9 explained			2
now a mother to four - year - old @entity44 ( pictured ) , ms @entity9 has the @entity48 to thank for her sons miracle birth ms @entity9 required chemotherapy after removing the lump on her breast through surgery			1
chemotherapy not only destroys cancer cells in the body , but also often leads to early menopause in women ' and then once a month i had the [ goserelin ] injections			1
it was just a like a pellet that went into my tummy and put my ovaries to sleep			0
' the goserelin injections were administered in an attempt to stop the women 's ovaries from producing eggs while they received chemotherapy , according to professor @entity84 , chair of the @entity85			1
' what started the study was the idea that if you can switch your ovaries off and put them into resting stage , in theory that should make them less susceptible to chemotherapy , ' professor @entity84 said			2
' there are drugs that already do that , but they are used for other purposes			0
so this study just re-purposed a drug used for another reason to see if that ovary resting would help preserve fertility and prevent early menopause			1
' astonishingly , the study proved successful , with only 8 per cent of the women who received the goserelin injections experiencing menopause two years after their cancer treatment			1
this was compared to the 22 per cent of women who went through early menopause after receiving standard cancer treatment with no injections			1
the goserelin recipients were also twice as likely to have normal pregnancies after their cancer treatment , a reality that still astonishes ms @entity9			1
@entity44 : the drug trial involved 256 women around the world receiving a monthly injection of goserelin alongside their chemotherapy , which reduced estrogen production , and ' switching off ' their ovaries success : only 8 per cent of the women who received the goserelin injections experiencing menopause two years after their cancer treatment , compared to the 22 per cent of women who did n't receive the injections ' there was never any trying at all , ' she said of her natural conception			1
' i finished in june with the chemo part , but i still had to have radiation therapy			0
when i had an ultrasound in september , we saw that my ovaries were still shriveled up and asleep and i was panicking			0
' @entity84 said it was alright and we 'll just see how we go , but i jokingly asked her " can i have a baby now ? " and she just said " no , no , not yet			0
" ' the next time i saw her , i was pregnant			0
' ms @entity9 fell pregnant in december , only six months after finishing her treatment			1
in february , she found herself experiencing morning sickness , but thought nothing of it until daring to take a home pregnancy test			0
' it was a scary time			0
the thought went through my mind : " am i going to have to terminate him ? " i was n't even sure if i was allowed to have him or if there would be something wrong with him – it was a scary lot of mixed emotions , ' she said			0
after the initial shock and perfect amniocentesis results , she was over the moon – now ms @entity9 ca n't imagine her life without four - year - old @entity44			2
' he ’s an old soul – he 's definitely been here before , ' she said			0
' he 's way above his years and he 's quite a character			0
' professor @entity84 , who ran the trial , said the results showed that goserelin injections could also lead to similar positive results in women with other cancers ms @entity9 has since had her ovaries removed as a preventative measure and will likely have a double mastectomy , but the proud mother ca n't imagine her life without her new son ms @entity9 's battle with cancer is not over , however			1
after removing her ovaries in a bid to avoid her high risk of developing ovarian cancer , the proud mother is now looking towards a double mastectomy for similar reasons			2
but with her chemotherapy days behind her , and her happy little boy helping her get through it , ms @entity9 said she finally has room to breathe			1
despite the study only being administered in breast cancer patients , professor @entity84 said the results showed that goserelin injections could also lead to similar positive results with other cancers			1
' this is a drug that can be accessed in @entity203 today , so it can be done , ' she said			0
' it 's not covered by the @entity205 for this purpose though , so people need to buy it , but what we hope is that the company that makes it will now apply to have it funded for this purpose			0
' the benefit of this study is that it will also be able to be used in other kinds of cancer for similar benefits as well , including lymphoma			0
' ' one of the other important things , is that although it was run in a large number of countries in the world , it was actually an idea initiated in @entity203			0
by collaborating with researchers in other countries we were able to have found enough young women in this situation – we could n't have done it just in @entity203			2

the drug goserelin was found to successfully reverse early menopause in women receiving chemotherapy
@entity9 gave birth to a healthy boy after struggling through chemotherapy for her breast cancer
the drug works by *reversibly* ' *shutting* down ' the ovaries during treatment
