' they just did n't have the evidence			0
' @entity85 and the @entity98 say @entity94 found on a @entity100 cigarette butt at the @entity102 crime scene suggests the real killer is a former @entity35 inmate recently charged in the deaths of two women who were among five victims in the ' @entity108 ' murders near @entity109 about the same time @entity32 's throat was slashed			2

the @entity142 overturned the initial conviction based partly on the trial judge 's refusal to allow defense attorneys to present evidence that @entity7 could have learned everything she told investigators from newspaper accounts			1
nevertheless , @entity7 ' lawyers were unable to persuade the jury in the second trial to disregard her earlier confession , @entity85 said			2
