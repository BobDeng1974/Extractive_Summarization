by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 12 march 2013 @entity1 is claiming sex discrimination , harassment , victimisation , and constructive dismissal against her former employers @entity6 @entity7 a @entity10 trader labelled ' @entity11 ' was singled out for dismissal by her @entity14 boss after she spurned his sexual advances , an employment tribunal was told			1
@entity1 , 32 , who is suing @entity6 for more than £ 5million , claims her boss became ' irritated ' after she rejected his sexual overtures and placed her on a firing list in revenge			1
and one colleague told her that the boss must have hired her ' because of her tits			1
' in a statement to @entity25 , miss @entity1 said she had been shocked to discover that @entity26 , who had personally head - hunted her , singled her out to be dismissed as she had turned to him for support over bullying by other male colleagues			1
she said : ' on reflection , it seems to me that this may have been because , on or around december 1 2011 , @entity26 made an inappropriate and unwanted sexual overture towards me at an after work dinner event , which i rejected			2
' having now read @entity26 's statement , it seems perhaps that @entity26 was irritated that i had rejected his advances and sought to punish me by means of placing my name on a list of people to be fired			2
' this also seems to be supported by @entity45 's comment to me on january 22 2012 that @entity26 must have wanted " extra services " and that i must have been hired because of my " tits "			1
' the tribunal heard how the @entity14 - born @entity50 graduate was subjected to a ' sustained and vicious campaign of harassment and discrimination ' for being a woman			2
male colleagues labelled her ' mad ' and ' crazy ' and told that she needed to have sex with @entity59 tribesmen to ' calm her down ' , it is claimed			0
miss @entity1 , who took home £ 750,000 a year in salary and bonuses , said the relentless bullying began before she even started work at the firm 's @entity66 office because she had earlier blown the whistle on insider trading by a senior trader at the bank			1
she had initially quit her job as head of fixed income sales in february 2010 after being told by bosses that her complaint of insider trading was ' unacceptable '			1
but she was lured back to the bank 's @entity66 - based subsidiary , @entity80 @entity7 , by @entity26 , who guaranteed her an annual bonus of £ 666,000 on top of her £ 120,000 salary			2
but once there she claims she was subjected to a litany of degrading comments as part of a bid by her line manager @entity89 and chief executive officer @entity89 to oust her because of her whistleblowing			2
miss @entity1 , the daughter of a shipping broker , said : ' for example , my manager and colleagues described me in sexist terms as " @entity11 " , " b * * * * " , " chemically dependent minigarch daughter " and " miss @entity99 " in communications made to senior people within @entity80 group and to clients			1
' @entity1 is suing her firm after claiming she was bullied and tormented by male colleagues in one email her boss @entity89 , who now accepts the drugs slurs were untrue , told a client ' we are all quaking here - awaiting arrival of ms @entity113 in a puff of sulphurous smoke '			1
senior analyst @entity116 allegedly wrote an email to a co-worker where he said how he ' knew a few tribe leaders in @entity59 ... proper alpha male ... she needs to relax after the stressful period of the past months			0
these guys would help '			0
miss @entity1 claims boss @entity89 was among those who victimised her because she blew the whistle on insider dealing , which he denies miss @entity1 said she ' burst into tears ' when she read the comments made about her			1
she said : ' i believe this comment is indicative of the bank 's chauvinistic culture generally , and discriminatory treatment of me			0
' the references to me being mentally unstable and a drug user were particularly hurtful for me because my mother suffers from mental illness and alcoholism			0
' my whole life has been dedicated to trying to rise above the destructive behaviour that had afflicted her			0
' to discover the extent of the sexist comments made against me is shocking			0
" six months after she started at the @entity66 office , her name was on a ' firing list ' for poor performance and she started a grievance process against the bank			0
she was signed off sick with stress before finally resigning in april last year			0
she is suing the bank for sex discrimination , harassment , victimisation and constructive dismissal			2
the bank strongly denies the allegations and claims that miss @entity1 routinely lost her temper and lacked experience in equity sales			1
a document submitted to the tribunal , @entity163 , representing @entity80 , states : ' aspects of the claimant 's performance , namely her ability to work effectively and harmoniously with others , were of concern to her employer and colleagues			0
' it adds that miss @entity1 had a ' rude and dismissive attitude towards colleagues , her unprofessional behaviour and her tendency to lose her temper and self control when things did not go her way '			1
spokesman @entity180 said ' @entity181 can not comment on the specifics of a historical matter which is subject to the judgement of an employments tribunal			0
however , the company is confident that it has acted appropriately and lawfully and will vigorously defend itself against all allegations made			0
' the hearing continues .			0
