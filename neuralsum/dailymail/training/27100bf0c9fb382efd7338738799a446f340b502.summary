the widow of a cyclist who was killed in a country lane two years ago is still battling police - accusing them of making a catalogue of errors when they investigated his death			2
@entity9 was 67 when he was involved in the incident near @entity11 , @entity12 , but police were not told about the crash for 30 hours , by which time he had died and the scene had been cleared			1
when they finally did investigate mr @entity9 's case , they said there was ' no third party involvement ' - after just 15 minutes			1
that was before they knew a couple who dialled 999 were heard arguing during the call about whether their car had hit him			1
grief : mr @entity9 's widow @entity31 ( left with her son @entity32 ) has battled @entity33 for almost three years			1
now an @entity35 report has upheld her complaint against the force and told officers to look at aspects of the case again ' bungling ' : retired @entity41 engineer mr @entity9 died of catastrophic head injuries after coming off his bicycle in a country lane			1
police were initially not told about the accident at all by paramedics for more than 24 hours now mr @entity9 's widow @entity31 , 66 , claims that she will never know how her husband died and is calling for the investigation to be reopened			1
she is fighting her case at the @entity35 after an internal report - seen by @entity53 - confirmed a clutch of ' administrative ' failings by officers			1
retired @entity41 engineer mr @entity9 suffered a 7ins fracture to his skull when he crashed on november 24 , 2011 near his home in @entity59 , @entity12			1
he was taken to hospital where he was ruled unfit for surgery and died later the same day			0
killed : @entity9 , 67 , was hurled from his bike - and police said it was an accident within minutes but paramedics did not tell police and they only found out 30 hours after the crash , by which time the scene had long since been cleared			1
fifteen minutes after being told and before they interviewed any witnesses or visited the scene , police said no third party had been involved - a decision the force now admits was wrong			1
it took them another four days to take a statement from the driver of the car who dialled 999 , who was one of the two main witnesses			1
mr @entity9 's family , who insisted his injuries were so severe that he must have been hit , lodged an internal complaint with @entity33			1
but they had to wait until an inquest recorded his death as an accident before receiving a reply			0
other findings of the 11 - page report include : mr @entity9 's children @entity32 , 46 , @entity94 , 43 , and @entity95 , 40 , claim that they have repeatedly been denied answers by police over the last two years			1
his widow said : ' we feel angry and helpless and i will not stop until we get some form of justice			2
' every day i relive that day and i just ca n't get it out of my head			0
because we have no answers and we ca n't piece together what happened			0
i ca n't let it go			0
it 's taken over my life			0
' they gave us the tape of the 999 call 10 minutes before the inquest started			2
our barrister did n't really have a chance to look at it			0
the whole result seemed cut and dried before we walked in			0
' country lane : the crash happened in this lane close to mr @entity9 's village home near @entity11 , @entity12 care : mr @entity9 cycled the same route five times a week after being bought a bicycle for his 50th birthday			1
an internal investigation also found forensic evidence was lost when a bag containing his clothes was left open his son , @entity32 , added : ' the report has shown them up for what a shoddy investigation they carried out			1
' we 've complained to the @entity12 police commissioner and our local mp			2
all through the two and a half years i 've been completely at a loss as to why so many people have treated us so badly			0
' the police just have n't listened to us			0
in my mind all the facts point to him being hit			0
they completely failed to do some basic policing and it makes you wonder what else could have not been picked up			0
' it has been a catastrophe for the family			0
it 's bad enough losing anyone through natural causes but to be denied closure for so long is awful			0
' i 'm still so angry			0
it 's been the overriding emotion throughout the whole period - we 're frustrated at not being listened to			2
' mr @entity9 , who was married to @entity31 for 44 years , took up cycling after his children bought him a bike for his 50th birthday			1
a life together : mr and mrs @entity162 on their wedding day in 1967 ( left ) and before he died in november 2011 @entity165 : mr @entity9 pictured with his son @entity32 before his death in 2011			1
the family say they find it hard to grieve the pensioner who was wearing a helmet was cycling a route he took five times a week when he crashed			0
@entity175 from nearby @entity176 , who was driving his girlfriend @entity177 to work , told the inquest that he pulled over onto a verge to avoid hitting mr @entity9 on a hill and dialled 999			1
the distressing call , played in court and heard by @entity53 , featured the couple arguing over whether they hit the cyclist			0
switching between the operator and his girlfriend , mr @entity175 said : ' he just completely lost control ... no , he did n't touch us at all , we did n't hit him at all			2
' miss @entity177 is heard saying : ' the back end of the bike hit us ' , to which he replied : ' no it did n't , we did n't hit him at all			0
he came off and then we hit the bike , we went over the bike			0
that was what happened because he just absolutely lost it			0
' ' the recording of the rationale behind a number of decisions and actions has been shown to be unsatisfactory ' - @entity205 report she told the inquest mr @entity9 was cycling at high speed with a ' fixed ' impression on his face , so may have been suffering a medical episode			1
police only listened to the 999 call for the first time more than a month later , and decided not to re-interview the driver or passenger			2
the coroner ruled the death was an accident and told the couple , who were never arrested or accused of any offence , that they should not feel in any way responsible for what happened			2
in their complaint mr @entity9 's family alleged officers had been ' rude and condescending ' to them when they raised concerns			1
however , the report said this complaint was not proven			0
the concerns were more , the report said , down to a breakdown in communication with the family			0
the report did , however , detail anomalies in the way some records were kept			0
while the report was written , an officer came forward to say he had checked the dent on the car and decided it did not match the damage to mr @entity9 's handlebars			1
yet this was not disclosed in the police 's original documents , the report said , and only came out when the report was compiled more than a year later			2
changes : ambulance chiefs in the south east have altered their policy on cyclists since mr @entity9 died the report said it was ' not possible to determine whether or not any officer has a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct , as your complaints have not been sufficiently investigated ' consequences : the @entity35 noted that one of the crash investigators was not fully - qualified at the time the force admitted the family felt there had been a ' breakdown of communication ' - partly because there was a lack of liasion officers - but said many of their claims were not borne out			1
it did , however , admit the officer who said there was no third party involvement ' prejudged the outcome ' without testing other theories properly			2
happy family : the cyclist with his wife and son @entity95 ' although hampered by the lack of an effective audit trail ... most relevant lines of enquiry have been followed although the recording of the rationale behind a number of decisions and actions has been shown to be unsatisfactory , ' the report said			0
however , it added : ' there is no evidence to indicate the outcome of the inquest into @entity9 's death would have been any different '			1
three officers received ' management action ' over the investigation , the report says , but the family have not been told what that was			2
the @entity312 has since changed its policy to tell police immediately whenever a cyclist is hit			2
a force spokesman told @entity53 : ' @entity33 is sympathetic to the family of mr @entity9 for their loss			1
' a full investigation into the incident in november 2011 was carried out by officers from our @entity322 and the findings were submitted to the coroner , who recorded a verdict of accidental death			2
' following a complaint received , @entity33 has carried out a full review of the original investigation , and a copy of this report has been sent to mr @entity9 's family , who have now contacted the @entity35			1
' the review 's conclusion was that the investigation was carried out correctly			0
however , @entity33 notes that there are administrative areas which can be learned from and added to procedures in our best practice guide			0
' we are satisfied that the officer who investigated the family 's complaint made contact with the family on a regular basis , over and above that which is required			1

@entity9 died on route he took almost daily near @entity11 , @entity12
but medics did not tell police about crash - they found out 30 hours later
report reveals police said no third party was involved after 15 minutes , even though couple who dialled 999 argued about if their car hit the bike
forensic evidence was lost and investigator was not fully qualified
coroner : @entity368 was accidental and 999 couple should not feel responsible
@entity205 report said outcome of the inquest would not have changed
but widow @entity31 , 66 , filed complaint with @entity35 and says she can not move on
forensic evidence was lost when a bag containing mr @entity9 's clothes was left open .
officers seized mr @entity9 's bicycle but not the car whose *occupants* dialled 999 , which had a dent on the front .
the officer who made this decision was not a fully qualified forensic collision investigator at the time .
the car was *declared* a write - off six months after the bike crash , and police only found out because mr @entity9 's family checked its status online .
