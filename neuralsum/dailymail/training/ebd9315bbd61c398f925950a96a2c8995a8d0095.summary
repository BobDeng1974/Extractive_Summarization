by @entity0 published : 04:15 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 04:27 est , 20 august 2013 seven months after nearly losing my leg during an emergency operation , i sent my medical notes to a hospital 3,700 miles away			1
the @entity7 box bulged with 26 pages of letters ; 54 sheets detailing ultrasounds , x-rays , pathology results and blood transfusion reports ; @entity16 readings of the electrical activity of my heart ; five cd - roms of ct scans ; specifics about my operations ; hospital discharge notes and so on			1
i was taking advantage of a little - known but increasingly popular opportunity to get second opinions from some of @entity28 's ( and , therefore , the world 's ) best hospitals and doctors			1
not that i do n't trust doctors here , but i faced a devil 's dilemma : what to do after a spectacularly failed operation ? my problems had begun months earlier , when a fierce pain in my calf made walking difficult			1
an ultrasound at the @entity41 revealed an aneurysm - a ballooning portion of artery - behind my right knee			2
the cost varies with the condition , and ranges from @entity48 's £ 365 to @entity49 's £ 710 the cause of aneurysms is unknown , although they are more common in older men and may be linked to clogged arteries and , in the case of knees , stresses on the arteries when the leg bends and straightens			1
i was told if my aneurysm was left untreated , blood could clot in it , shutting down blood flow - and some clots might travel down to the foot			2
either scenario could lead to amputation of the lower leg			2
the solution was to remove that portion of the artery , bridging the gap with a graft			2
my operation last december seemed to be a success			2
out of hospital in a week , i was soon walking			2
but less than a month later , i was readmitted with a deep wound infection and needed further operations			2
the first , to clean out the wound , failed to defeat the infection			2
the second removed the graft , leaving an 8cm gap			2
the gamble was that , over time , more blood would flow through the smaller blood vessels to keep the leg supplied			2
there followed a third emergency operation at 5am one day to deal with heavy bleeding			2
i had to be given ten units of blood - about the amount the body contains - and doctors began discussing the chances of me losing my leg or my life			1
but after more antibiotics , i kept both , and was discharged five weeks later			2
some infection remained and i continued to take antibiotics , but nothing more could be done in hospital			2
the hope was that my body would naturally keep the infection under control			2
' all the prestige hospitals are involved , ' says @entity108 , of the @entity109 walking was more difficult and painful than before the operations , unsurprisingly seeing as how there was little real blood flow to the lower leg			1
my foot was effectively dead - white and cold - but it still managed to be immensely , relentlessly painful			2
drugs and exercise meant it got just enough blood - and , therefore , oxygen - to be what the surgeon euphemistically called ' viable '			2
the dilemma ? @entity121 to live on permanent heavy painkillers and cope with a limited lifestyle , or repeat the operation to fit a graft , which had nearly cost me my life			1
my specialist said only i could decide			2
that 's when i discovered online second opinions			1
the service began in @entity28 in the late nineties and has grown quickly			1
' all the big , prestige hospitals in @entity28 are involved , ' says @entity108 , chief executive officer of the @entity109			1
dr @entity133 , an associate professor at @entity134 , started organising second opinions four years ago			0
that first year there were 100 to 150 cases ; today there are about 1,000 , with half outside of the @entity28			1
hospitals list an array of conditions on which they can offer a second opinion			1
dr @entity133 says he can call on about 4,500 specialists , adding : ' we can pretty well guarantee a world expert in your condition no matter how rare			0
' and the other hospitals make similar promises			1
i decided to seek a second opinion from the @entity154 in @entity155 , which has repeatedly come out top in this medical area ( as ranked by the @entity159 survey , which analyses 5,000 @entity28 hospitals )			1
after registering online , i was asked for credit card details			0
the fee is not charged until the second opinion is sent , and you can pull out without charge before this			1
the cost varies with the condition , and ranges from @entity48 's $ 565 ( about £ 365 ) , the amount i paid , to @entity49 's $ 1,100 ( about £ 710 )			1
there can also be extras , such as paying for test results to be reviewed			0
and then the work begins			0
first , i had to complete a 56 - page questionnaire			0
the hospital also requires a lot of additional information ( hence the bulging @entity7 box )			1
your condition determines what this demands , but collecting it involves time , energy and persistence			0
gathering data from two hospitals and a surgeon in the @entity188 took me more than two months.the drawback is that the consultant does not examine the patient			1
however , the hospitals offering the service say doctors have evolved techniques to compensate			1
@entity196 , of @entity197 in @entity198 , @entity199 , says : ' in the past , you had a physician who would hold a film up to a light			0
now they are looking at their monitors and making decisions there			0
' but @entity188 experts have doubts			0
dr @entity209 , clinical vice-president of the @entity212 , explains : ' an online consultation with someone you 've never met seems difficult			0
the difference between the @entity28 system and us is that we use @entity219 to make referrals to specialists			1
patients do n't refer themselves			1
' many patients are rewarded only with peace of mind when specialists endorse their original diagnosis ( @entity228 for some patients - including this one - this difference is a positive , making the @entity28 system seem less protectionist and puts the patient in charge			1
) although many patients are rewarded only with peace of mind when specialists endorse their original diagnosis and treatment ( itself an important return ) , treatment can change radically for some			1
testimonials on the @entity48 website include one from dr @entity242 from @entity243 , whose daughter was told she had a rare heart deformity necessitating surgery			1
@entity48 's doctors examined tests and mri images and concluded there was no deformity			1
in another case , @entity252 , from @entity253 , was told a mitrial valve prolapse ( when the flaps in one of the heart 's valves do n't close tightly ) required an operation			1
her second opinion suggested she did n't need surgery , at least for now			1
as well as the standard fee , i paid £ 90 for courier delivery of my data			1
so , was it worth it ? my answer is a resounding yes			0
my four - page conclusions arrived three months after my first parcel was sent , from dr @entity273 , a specialist in interventional cardiology and endovascular interventions			0
dr @entity273 was born in @entity277 and is a poetry lover , i was told			0
his cv is filled with qualifications , awards and published papers			0
it 's a good source of lutein , an antioxidant needed for the macula , the part of the eye that allows us to see fine detail			1
eating lutein - rich foods has been shown to reduce the risk of age - related macular degeneration			0
i had half hoped for a miracle cure			0
this was not to be			0
nevertheless , i thought his report brilliant , summing up my problems and the pros and cons of the different steps i could take			0
my impressed gp said it contained information about my condition that she had not known from my @entity188 @entity309 advice read : ' it appears that you have exhausted all options			0
' except for more surgery			0
' because of what you have gone through and the residual infection that may still be present in your leg , the risk would be high , ' it stated			0
apart from a suggested drug change , i was doing everything right			0
in the @entity188 , one drug - naftidrofuryl - is prescribed on the @entity322 to increase the amount of oxygen carried in blood			0
he preferred another called @entity327 ( more than three times the price )			0
my surgeon offered it on private prescription , but advised against it because of side - effects			0
dr @entity273 said i should only have surgery if i could no longer accept the physical limitations caused by the leg , or if the leg came into danger			0
any operation , his report said - giving detailed reasons - would carry a risk of amputation			0
so when my surgeon asked what i 'd decided , i said i would accept any lifestyle changes to avoid surgery , including taking permanent heavy painkillers and adjusting my life			0
although i 'm past retirement age , i am a full - time journalist and author			0
before the operation , i was in helicopters with trauma doctors and had been operating undercover in @entity354 investigating sweat shops			1
that level of activity would have to end			0
i would also have to limit the energy i could put into being taught ballet by my four - year - old granddaughter			0
' i did n't want to press you either way , ' said my surgeon , after a long silence			0
' but that 's what i hoped you 'd decide			1
