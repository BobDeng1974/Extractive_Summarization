eyesore electricity pylons which blight some of the @entity3 ’s most spectacular countryside are to be removed at a cost of £ 7 million each			1
power lines will be buried underground as part of the £ 500 million @entity8 scheme which aims to reverse some of the damage done by the poor planning decisions of the past			1
but such is the enormous cost of the engineering work required that the fund – which will ultimately be paid for by electricity customers – only has enough money to dismantle 65 pylons			1
the eight year scheme is expected to cost the average household 22p a year			1
it has not yet been decided which pylons will be the ones to be removed			2
but yesterday a shortlist was published identifying 12 sections of overhead lines where the pylons are deemed to have the worst impact on the environment			2
they are in four national parks - the @entity38 , @entity39 , the @entity40 and the @entity41 — and four areas of outstanding natural beauty — @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and the @entity47			0
but the huge costs expected to be taken up in the process of negotiating with landowners and digging the wide trenches required to bury the cables mean that only a fraction of the pylons in these scenic landscapes can be dealt with			2
the @entity38 in @entity56 ( pictured ) is one of four national parks short - listed to have pylons taken down and , controversially , there is no money left in the pot for other beauty spots including the @entity64 and @entity65 , and the @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
feasibility tests undertaken in early 2015 will decide exactly which pylons should be removed , with the first dismantling work set to begin in 2019			2
two pylons which straddle the @entity46 , blighting a large section of the area between @entity75 and @entity76 , have been viewed to be among the worst offenders and may be the first to be removed			0
at the centre of the decision making process is a advisory group including representatives from the @entity83 , campaign to @entity84 and the @entity85 walking charity			0
crucially the public , although they will in effect be footing be the bill , will not be consulted on which pylons to remove			0
the @entity41 in @entity93 ( pictured ) has been shortlisted to have some of its pylons removed - but there is no money left in the pot for other beauty spots including the @entity66 @entity99 , an environmentalist , author and broadcaster who chairs the group , said the biggest problem faced by the panel was the realisation that there simply was n’t enough money in the scheme			1
@entity8 had originally recommended spending £ 1.1 billion on removing pylons but @entity110 , the energy watchdog , cut the budget to £ 500 million			1
speaking to the @entity115 , mr @entity99 said : ‘ having thought , ‘ gosh , £ 500 million is a huge amount of money for national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty ’ , the big surprise for the panel was waking up to the cost of the extreme engineering solutions and realising it is not going to stretch very far			1
‘ sixty years ago , when these lines were put through , attitudes and values were different			0
this is a chance to go back and remedy the situation			0
‘ we would like this to be the first of a series of similar commitments			0

power lines will be buried underground in £ 500 million @entity8 scheme
but huge cost of engineering work means only 65 pylons will be dismantled
eight year scheme expected to cost the average household 22p a year
it has not yet been decided which pylons will be the ones removed
