by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 firm @entity2 has unveiled a robot called @entity5 , which it says can read human emotions in a country dominated by ' kawaii ' - or cute culture - @entity9 has embraced the rise of cuddly robots			1
now , one @entity3 - based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world 's first droid that can read human emotions			1
mobile carrier @entity2 said its robot , named @entity5 , will go on sale in @entity9 in february for 198,000 yen ( £ 1,130 or $ 1,900 )			1
the machine , which has no legs , but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a @entity3 suburb , cooing and humming			1
it touched hands with @entity2 chief executive @entity26 , described by the firm as a @entity28 or ' @entity30 ' moment			1
@entity5 uses an ' emotional engine ' and a cloud - based artificial intelligence to study gestures , expressions and human speech tones			1
' our aim is to develop affectionate robots that can make people smile , ' @entity26 said			0
robotic companions are hugely popular in @entity9 , but no companion robot has emerged as a major market success yet			2
@entity9 electronics and entertainment company @entity43 discontinued the @entity47 pet - dog robot in 2006 , despite an outcry from its fans			2
at that time , @entity43 had developed a child - shaped entertainment robot similar to @entity5 but much smaller , capable of dances and other charming moves			2
however , it never became a commercial product			0

@entity2 chief executive @entity26 is shown interacting with the robot @entity68 has developed the walking , talking @entity71 robot , but that is too sophisticated and expensive for home use , and appears in @entity68 showrooms and at gala events only			1
even then , it is prone to glitches because of its complexity			0
many other @entity9 companies , including @entity81 and @entity82 , not to mention universities and startups , have developed various robots , that entertain and serve as companions			0
there is little emphasis on delivering on practical work , in contrast to industrial robots at factories and military robots for war			0
but the potential is great for intelligent machines as the number of elderly requiring care is expected to soar in rapidly - aging @entity9 in coming years			0

' our aim is to develop affectionate robots that can make people smile , ' @entity26 said ( left ) in thursday 's demonstration , @entity5 sang , ' i want to be loved			2
' @entity2 's chief executive ( right ) , @entity26 said @entity5 can also dance and tell jokes robotics are already used to check on the elderly and monitor their health and safety , but they might also play a role in reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation			1
the prospect of robot overlords , friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years			0
but according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness , emotional machines will never exist			0
this is because computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling , one expert claims			0
a mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by @entity146 at the @entity147 , shows that computers can not handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly			0
if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information , computers ca n’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans			0
the 48 inch ( 121 cm ) ( 48 inch ) tall , 62 lb ( 28 kg ) white @entity5 has no hair , but two large doll - like eyes and a flat - panel display stuck on its chest			1

it also has two cameras and four microphones on its head and has @entity183 and ethernet networking capabilities			0
