by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 26 june 2013 as @entity2 arrived at @entity3 today it was easy to see where her daughters @entity5 and @entity6 get their good looks from			0
the mother - of - three belied her 58 years as she strolled through the grounds in an eye - catching bright blue dress with a cropped white blazer			1
although she 's set to become a grandmother next month , she could have passed for the older sister of her pregnant daughter with her fresh face and brunette hair			2
along with her husband , @entity21 , 64 , she then took a seat in the royal box on centre court to enjoy the championship tennis			1
she was joined there by an array of famous faces including presenter @entity37 and double @entity39 champion @entity38			0
@entity2 looked to be having a whale of a time as she shared a joke with actor @entity43 and tried to beat @entity44 to catch a tennis ball hit into the box from the court during the first match			2
grandparents - to - be to the heir to the throne : the couple take their seats in the royal box world class company : the pair sat behind double @entity39 champion @entity38 he 's faster than you ! @entity44 beat @entity21 to catch a ball sent from the court @entity2 has passed her love of the game on to her three children who are all avid fans of the sport and @entity6 is also a keen player			1
earlier in the month she joined @entity6 to watch @entity64 play in the @entity66 's tournament			2
but she was n't joined by any of her off spring today as @entity6 , 29 , and @entity67 , 26 , had been in the royal box on monday to see the first day of play which included @entity71 and @entity64 's first round matches			1
@entity73 of @entity74 is not expected to attend this year as she is currently heavily pregnant			0
enjoying the game : fresh - faced @entity2 smiled throughout the day tennis aces : earlier this month @entity2 joined @entity6 to watch @entity64 play at @entity66 's family of fans : @entity6 and @entity67 were in the royal box on monday the @entity81 were able too see a bumper crop of world class tennis players as they watched @entity86 defeat @entity84 and then charismatic @entity88 @entity87 against @entity89			1
they will then be able to see @entity71 in action as he takes on @entity92 later today on centre court but they will not see @entity95 's number one player as @entity64 will play on court one			1
@entity2 will soon become the grandmother to the heir to the throne when her daughter gives birth and is expected to be present at the labour in the private @entity103 of @entity104 in @entity105 , where prince @entity106 was born in 1982			0
sources told the @entity108 last week that @entity5 , 31 , is particularly keen to have the support of her family around her because father - to - be @entity106 , also 31 , may be on duty in @entity113 , where he is still working as a @entity115 pilot at @entity116 on @entity117 , when the baby arrives			0
she 's been spotted shopping for baby products with the @entity5 on numerous occasions as the excitement builds for her first grandchild - who might been seen at @entity3 themselves in years to come if the family passion for tennis is passed on .			0
