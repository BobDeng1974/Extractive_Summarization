more than a million voters in swing states are being sent an @entity3 documentary that claims the president 's mother once posed for pornographic photos wearing bondage gear			1
the shocking - and totally unfounded - claims made in the dvd represent a new low in the election dirty tricks war today provoking fury among @entity14 and likely to trigger outrage in the @entity16			2
' @entity17 ' , made by a right - wing film - maker who is a long - time critic of @entity19 , includes images of a woman it claims is the president 's mother @entity23 clad in leather gloves , boots and a corset posing seductively on a couch			1
the film also alleges that mr @entity19 's real father is left wing poet poet and @entity33 activist @entity32 , and that ms @entity23 's marriage was a ' sham ' to cover this up			1
but they could have serious consequences as more than one million copies have been mailed to voters in @entity60 , a key swing state where @entity61 is lagging in the polls			1
some 100,000 copies have also been sent to voters in @entity65 and the same number to @entity67 - with up to three million more still to come			1
it has even won the support of @entity72 's @entity71 chairman @entity70 who has said : ' that ( the film ) is absolutely frightening			1
i verified that it is factual , all of it			0
' argument : @entity83 members are suspected to be behind the funding of the dvd made by @entity86 and research that went into the website but @entity89 consultant @entity89 said today : ' it 's about the lowest thing you can do to accuse , with no evidence , the opposition candidate 's mother of being a porn star			1
' there are two motives behind this - racism and money			0
it 's a cynical attempt to make some coin and exploit the views of the fringes of mainstream views			0
' ' @entity17 ' claims that the president 's family history is an elaborate lie			2
the real story is that his mother 's marriage to @entity113 was a sham to cover up her affair with mr @entity32 , who mr @entity19 has referred to as his ' mentor '			1
mr @entity32 supposedly photographed ms @entity23 whilst she was pregnant with mr @entity19 and sold the photos to 1950s magazines with titles like ' @entity120 ' , and ' @entity121 '			1
claims : a website for the dvd entitled , @entity17 , compares photographs of a young mr @entity32 with @entity19 's high school photographs presenting them as similar like father like son ? mr @entity86 's dvd claims that @entity23 's marriage to @entity113 is a ' sham ' to cover up her affair with mr @entity32 ( right ) in one the woman - there is no proof offered that she is ms @entity23 - is posing wearing the corset , gaudy earrings and a large necklace with her hair cut short			1
in another photo she sits on a couch staring into the camera and in the other she is putting on an elbow length black leather glove			0
in a third she is reclining on the couch with her buttocks clearly visible and in others she is naked apart from a pair of high heels			0
in the film , a narrator who is supposed to be mr @entity19 says : ' these photos were taken a few weeks before 1960 , when mom was about five weeks pregnant with me			1
' @entity32 then sold the photos to men 's mail - order catalogues			2
' @entity19 's real mother : 100,000 copies of the video directed by @entity160 were mailed to voters in @entity60 claiming that @entity23 ( front , right ) ) is not the virtuous woman mr @entity19 purports her to be the film also claims that mr @entity19 ’s grandfather was not a furniture salesman but actually a @entity168 agent			1
the ' @entity19 ' narrator says : ' my election was not a sudden political phenomenon			2
' it was the culmination of an @entity175 socialist movement that my real father , @entity32 , nurtured in @entity177 and @entity178 , and has been quietly infiltrating the @entity175 economy , universities , and media for decades			1
' the case : mr @entity86 has not revealed who funded the video dreams from my real father according to the film mr @entity19 made regular visits to mr @entity32 from the age of 10 where he was ' indoctrinated in @entity189 during his formative years '			1
the movie 's director @entity86 said the documentary was the result of two years of research but he is already facing allegations it is a dirty tricks campaign			2
speaking to @entity197 mr @entity86 claimed that he matched up ms @entity23 to the pornographic pictures by comparing them to her high school photographs at the time			0
he and ' other researchers ' made the connection but he did not employ a photography expert			0
mr @entity86 said : ' her teeth matched , her nose matched , everything matched			0
' people do n’t want to hear this because there is a mass hysteria around president @entity19			2
' nobody wants to hear about the gap between what he says and what he wants to do			0
' mr @entity86 also declined to discuss who had paid for the film and would only reveal it was ' privately funded '			2
there is already speculation that @entity83 groups may have been behind it			0
mr @entity86 has been unapologetic about his film and said that he investigated the president because he thought he had a ' passion for class struggle that did not fit with his background '			0
he has said that he turned up ' convincing evidence that @entity23 had an intimate relationship with mr @entity32 ' including ' 30 photos of her in various compromising states of nudity '			2
mr @entity86 said : ' right away i could see that @entity32 has a striking resemblance to @entity19 while the @entity235 @entity19 looked nothing like him			1
@entity237 : since he took office in 2008 , mr @entity19 has been at the centre of many right wing theories about his background and nationality including one that suggested he might be an alien ' @entity32 was not only the biological father of @entity19 but also the ideological father			1
' i 've concluded that the people who were asking : " where 's the birth certificate ? " were asking the wrong question			0
the real question : " who 's the father ? " ' in his memoirs mr @entity19 has written how his mother , who was from @entity256 , @entity257 , met his @entity235 - born father whilst they were both studying @entity260 at the @entity261 in @entity262			1
they married in february 1961 but in august of that year she moved to @entity264 to study at the @entity265			0
reputation : @entity86 is a @entity267 based filmmaker known for his rabble - rousing style with films like ' @entity270 : @entity271 and @entity19 's @entity272 ' mr @entity19 was born on august 4 in @entity262 before she left			1
his long form birth certificate lists a 25 - year - old student called ' @entity113 ' as his dad , referring to his father			0
mr @entity113 is said to have finished his economics degree in @entity178 then studied at @entity279 before moving back to @entity235 in 1964 , the year he and ms @entity23 divorced			0
in a separate development the director of the @entity3 film 2016 , which has become a surprise box office hit , has made lurid claims similar to mr @entity86 's about ms @entity23 in his book : ' @entity286 '			2
in the book , which reached no.1 on the @entity290 bestseller list , @entity287 alleges that she sent her son to @entity178 just so she could cheat on his father with @entity293 men			0
according to extracts of the book on the @entity296 : ' @entity23 's sexual adventuring may seem a little surprising in view of the fact that she was a large woman who kept getting larger			0
' learning about @entity23 's sexual adventures in @entity293 , i realized how wrong i had been to consider @entity113 the playboy … @entity23 … was the real playgirl , and despite all her reservations about power , she was using her @entity175 background and economic and social power to purchase the romantic attention of third - world men			0
' since taking office mr @entity19 has been the subject of a number of bizarre claims about his past			1
right wing bloggers have claimed that the ' scar ' on his head was evidence he had undergone some kind of secret surgery			0
they suggested it could be anything from a routine procedure to the work of extra-terrestrials			0
the birther movement , which was championed by real estate mogul @entity326 , said that as the president was not from @entity178 it meant he was not eligible to be in the @entity16			0
when mr @entity19 released the long form of his birth certificate the issue finally went away			1
the issue of mr @entity19 ’s religion is another point of attack and despite publicly proclaiming his @entity337 beliefs , some still believe he is a @entity338			2

the film claims that mr @entity19 's real father is left wing poet and @entity33 activist , @entity32
100,000 copies of the dvd , containing extraordinary claims , have already been mailed to voters in @entity60 with up to three million more *planned* to go out
as @entity61 lags in the polls the material could be *potentially* *damaging* for the @entity19 campaign
it has already won the support of @entity72 's @entity71 chairman @entity70
@entity89 consultant @entity89 called the accusations ' low ' and motivated by race and money
