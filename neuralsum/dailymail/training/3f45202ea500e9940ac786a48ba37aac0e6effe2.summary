by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 1 march 2014 updated : 08:08 est , 2 march 2014 i first met @entity3 when she was three years old			1
she had big brown eyes , a mop of brown hair , skinny arms and legs and a bloated belly			2
home – if you could call it that – was a decaying orphanage for 300 children in the @entity15 city of @entity16 , three hours west of @entity17			1
no toys , no possessions			2
even her clothes were rotated with the other orphans			2
yet , despite the deprivation , @entity3 was a cheeky little thing who made a beeline for me every playtime			1
and when i left – after spending the summer of 1999 as a 20 - year - old volunteer at the orphanage – i ’d often think of her			1
brighter future : orphaned @entity15 teenager @entity3 in her new bedroom with racing presenter @entity0 , who raised the money to find a home for @entity3 and her siblings over the years , it was easier to imagine she ’d been adopted and was safe and happy , so that ’s what i did			1
but deep down i knew that was unlikely			2
for a while , the @entity42 did everything it could to help the orphans of @entity47 ’s dictatorship			0
inevitably , though , the world moves on			0
people ’s attention shifted elsewhere , but what of @entity3 ? three years ago i decided to go back to @entity15 to find out			1
all i had was a photo			0
i did n’t even know her surname			0
it took me weeks to find her			1
i searched the sewers of @entity17 where many homeless orphans seek shelter and spoke to prostitutes who had been in state care			0
i discovered her in @entity16 in a cramped two - bedroom flat with ten other children			2
she was no longer a toddler but a severely disturbed 13 - year - old			1
years of neglect and being tied to a radiator – that ’s how we found her – had done their worst			1
according to the child psychiatrist professor @entity72 , the brain shrinks when a person goes without love			0
so it was with @entity3			1
she could n’t talk or interact and hit herself constantly			0
it was so sad to look into her eyes			0
what had she seen and experienced over the past decade ? she was also painfully thin and could n’t walk very well			0
orphaned : @entity3 aged three , seen in a picture taken by @entity0 while she was a volunteer at the orphanage , was a happy toddler with a bleak future i could n’t abandon her again			1
this time i vowed i would find @entity3 a home , somewhere she would be safe			1
in truth , i had absolutely no idea how i was going to do this , but shortly afterwards i was hosting a charity event when i met someone from @entity93 and @entity94 , an incredible organisation that is working to close all children ’s institutions worldwide			2
i told them i wanted to build a house for @entity3			1
they set up a sub fund for her and helped me find a plot of land and get planning permission			2
they also gave me the credibility of working with experts who are leaders in their field			0
then there was the small matter of finding £ 200,000			0
so began more than two years of constant fundraising			2
i held an event at the @entity113 with the mp @entity114 and another at the @entity117 nightclub @entity115			0
i climbed ten peaks in ten hours , launched a @entity120 campaign and held online auctions			2
when i married my husband , @entity123 , a tv executive , in 2012 , we sold the wedding pictures to @entity125 ! and put the fee towards @entity3 ’s fund			1
at one time i found it hard to reconcile my job as @entity132 ’s formula 1 pit lane reporter with @entity3			1
seeing all the wealth was so far removed from what i was seeing in the children ’s projects i was by then beginning to visit			0
yet , in a way , it ’s been the home that @entity140 built			2
racing forward : @entity0 took help from her friends in the @entity140 world to raise money a female racing driver called @entity146 organised a karting day and my fellow @entity149 presenters pitched up			1
@entity151 and @entity152 sent their pit crews down and @entity154 gave me memorabilia for an auction			0
everyone says that @entity140 ’s an elitist sport but these people did n’t owe me anything , they just wanted to help			0
there were also bureaucratic hurdles to overcome			0
the authorities said they would facilitate my ‘ adoption ’ of @entity3 but on the condition that i took her siblings – which i ’d always wanted to do – plus eight other children i did n’t know			1
a couple of them were like feral animals and so institutionalised it scared me being in the same room with them			0
it was n’t how i ’d envisaged it			0
i have made a documentary for @entity177 , a home for @entity3 , and in all honesty some scenes are quite disturbing			1
this is n’t the nice happy ending of opening this cosy little home and having kids running around laughing			2
i admit i found it quite hard to take and there were a few reflective nights until i pulled myself together			2
as @entity93 and @entity94 has taught me , these are exactly the sort of children we should be helping			0
the ones who are n’t pretty to look at , the last ten per cent that nobody wants			2
last december , we moved in			0
@entity3 supposedly understands little of her surroundings , but the first moment we walked in her face changed			1
she pulled off her coat and started running around touching things , smelling things			0
i had wanted @entity3 to be socialised around ‘ normal ’ kids so she could mimic behaviour , raise her game and start communicating			1
but experts believe the environment she is in – with space , a garden , her own possessions – will help build a sense of identity she ’s never had			0
she has her own room , her own wardrobe covered in stickers and toys and clothes donated by friends in @entity215			0
at the end of the trip , when i said goodbye to @entity3 , she reached out , hugged me and began stroking my face , something she has never done before			1
i have no doubt she understands a lot more than we think			0
it was an end and a beginning			0
the @entity15 authorities have agreed to fund the home and i will continue to raise money to safeguard its future			1
this is where we start to try to reverse some of her symptoms and also gain a better understanding of the impact of institutionalisation			0
if @entity3 has taught me one thing it ’s that we have a moral duty to look after these children , to not presume that they can cope without love			1
@entity3 was n’t born this way			1
and while i ’m happy we ’ve been able to build this home and i ’m so thankful for all the support , there is also a profound sense of sadness			2
i genuinely feel that had i intervened sooner , @entity3 would n’t be in this situation			1
and nor would many more like her			0
the lost orphan : a home for @entity3 is on @entity177 at 7pm on wednesday .			1

@entity0 first met @entity3 in 1999 as a volunteer at an orphanage
she found her again , ten years later , a severely disturbed teen
she vowed to find a home for the @entity15 girl , and eventually *suceeded*
