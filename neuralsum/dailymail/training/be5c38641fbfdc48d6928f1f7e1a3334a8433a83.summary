by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:49 pm on 4th october 2011 a schoolgirl who became the youngest person in the world to undergo a double lung transplant four years ago has died			1
@entity6 was just five when she underwent the life - saving operation - but a year ago her body began to reject the organs			1
shortly before her death , the nine - year - old told mother @entity11 : ' i 'm not scared of dying , mummy , but i 'm scared of leaving you '			1
@entity6 with her mother @entity11 in 2007 : doctors said @entity6 's body began rejecting the organs in september last year ms @entity11 , 29 , said : ' i was in shock when she died			1
she went so peacefully , she did n't scream , she was n't in pain			2
' she looked like she was asleep			2
' @entity6 from @entity21 in @entity22 , had cystic fibrosis - a hereditary condition that affects the respiratory and digestive systems , when she was three - months - old			1
following the double transplant in january 2007 , @entity6 led a normal life but by september last year , doctors told her parents their daughter 's body had begun to reject the organs			1
sessions of radiation therapy to slow down the deterioration failed and last month @entity6 , who is an only child , developed breathing difficulties			1
she was taken to hospital where for the first time she told her father @entity40 that she was ' not fine '			2
ms @entity11 said they were offered another transplant but decided to decline for their daughter 's sake			2
' after nine - and - a - half years of fighting there comes a point where the body and mind ca n't take much more			1
she was my life , she suffered enough and there has to be a cut off point on what someone can take			1
it was the hardest decision of my life			1
' she never complained , but had said " mama , why ca n't i be like my nieces ? " i told her she was special and explained that if it was n't her that was ill it could be someone else			2
' and she said she would n't wish it on anybody else - she was a very , very wise girl			1
' she went on : ' @entity6 had a short life but i could have lost her four - and - a - half years ago			1
' she had so much fight			2
@entity6 was aware of her condition and the of amount medication she was taking			1
' at one point she was quite ill and could n't breathe and said " i 'm dying , i 'm dying "			2
i asked her what they felt like and she said she could see a white light and said that @entity73 was calling her			0
' i told her about what we believe and she told me that she was more scared of leaving me by myself			0
ms @entity11 added : ' she was an amazing girl			0
she left her mark wherever she went			0
she had a cheeky smile and you would always leave with a big smile on your face after speaking to her			0
' she left such an impression on people 's lives			0
she was bubbly , funny and moody like her mother but she knew how to wrap people around her little finger			1
' i 'm empty and i look around and expect her to call for me			0
' following her daughter 's death , ms @entity11 is urging more black and @entity92 people to register as donors			0
' you do n't think you 'll ever need to know about these things			0
but people need to have the issues around organ donation highlighted , ' she said			0
black and @entity92 people are three times more likely to need a kidney transplant than those from other ethnic origins			0
but they make up less than two per cent of deceased donors			0
a spokesman for @entity106 , said : ' we need people to talk about their wishes for organ donation and join the register			0
