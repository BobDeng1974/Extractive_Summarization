@entity0 always felt @entity1 was in danger of becoming over-stretched by working for both the @entity3 , and for @entity4			1
‘ with the two jobs , there was no rest for him , ’ said the @entity5 and @entity7 defender yesterday			2
‘ he was trying to make sure @entity11 get to the @entity12 and then going back to @entity4 and doing his best for them			1
@entity0 said @entity1 was always going to find it difficult balancing two different jobs ‘ @entity11 is a big job because you have to go around looking at players and seeing who is available , even under the grandparent rule			1
he has to go and watch players			2
‘ to add on the @entity4 job was a big ask			1
it seems now that it was too much for @entity1			1
he ’s realised he ca n’t do both			2
i ’m glad he ’s stuck with @entity11 , ’ he added			0
asked if @entity1 might come to regret his decision , @entity0 said , ‘ yeah , i think he might			1
but @entity1 will feel he ’s done the right thing			1
‘ he can concentrate on @entity11			0
that was the job he had first			0
’ @entity0 , who played in the ’ 94 @entity33 finals with @entity1 , was astonished by the timing of the resignation , and believes @entity4 boss @entity36 was caught unawares too			1
‘ i was shocked when i heard that news this morning because @entity4 are in a tough spot at the moment so to get another shock like that will surprise @entity4 fans			1
the former @entity44 captain was assistant manager for both @entity11 and @entity4 ‘ i think it will have caught out the @entity4 staff , especially @entity36 , as it ’s another big hurdle to be gotten over			1
‘ while i ’m disappointed @entity1 has left , i ’m still hopeful that we can dig our way out of trouble			1
’ @entity4 play at @entity51 on saturday , aware that a loss could drop the club into the relegation zone			1
‘ it ’s a massive game for us because we ’ve stopped the rot by drawing the last two games			0
‘ now we ’ve got to beat @entity51 to move away from the bottom , ’ said @entity0			2
former midfielder @entity59 , who played with @entity0 in the @entity4 team which won the 1996 @entity61 , feels there ’s more to the story than meets the eye			1
‘ it is a bit strange			0
you just wonder about the reasons why , ’ said the @entity70 ambassador			0
‘ i think he ’s said that because of the two roles , that he ca n’t do both			0
but i tend to think it might be a little bit more than that , although you have to go with what he ( @entity1 ) says			2
‘ why not wait until after tomorrow and tuesday as well , because they ’re two big games for us			0
so it ’s really bad timing			0
’ @entity0 said he felt @entity4 boss @entity36 will have been shocked by @entity1 's sudden departure @entity59 feels the @entity4 fans will miss @entity1 more than anyone			1
‘ they were always chanting his name , they loved his attitude ; he was always up in the fourth official ’s face			0
they had taken to him , probably a little bit more than the manager , to be honest , ’ he said			0
‘ the fourth officials must have been fearful of @entity4 games because he ( @entity1 ) was always combative			1
’ ‘ i bumped into him a few weeks ago at the team hotel and had a good conversation with him about things			0
‘ he was saying “ what is the fuss about , we ’ve got good players at the football club and it ’s only a matter of time before we turn things around			0
” ’ striker @entity110 ( below ) , who left @entity4 yesterday to go on loan at @entity112 , paid tribute to the former @entity4 assistant manager			2
‘ @entity1 was fantastic for me			2
he would tell it as it is			0
‘ if you want to get better as a player you need people like him to tell you the truth			0
‘ i got on well with him and it ’s a sorry loss for the club			0

@entity1 has resigned from his position at @entity4
the former @entity44 man will now only work for the @entity3
@entity0 said he felt @entity1 was always going to *struggle* with two jobs
