by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin the night before the 2008 - 09 @entity3 final at @entity4 , the 18 - year - old @entity1 was nervously preparing to bowl to @entity6			1
‘ is tendulkar going to take your life ? ’ asked his coach , trying to gee him up			0
‘ in the worst scenario you will get hit for six sixes			0
’ next day @entity1 inflicted on @entity13 ’s demigod a scratchy 15 - ball duck – @entity6 ’s first in two decades in the domestic game			1
he finished the innings with five wickets , then made 41 and 80			0
perhaps the only surprise about his all - round excellence at @entity20 and @entity21 is that it should even count as a surprise at all			1
pitching it just right : @entity1 has shown the @entity25 bowlers how to use @entity27 conditions the second test is not yet over , but already he has helped himself to three half - centuries from no 9 and a pair of five - fors			1
previously only @entity32 and @entity33 had scored fifty and taken five - wicket hauls in successive tests			2
in his first @entity28 series overseas @entity1 is rubbing statistical shoulders with giants			2
another 50 : @entity1 acknowledges his third half century of the test series at @entity21 the @entity41 dressing - room were quietly fuming when @entity42 beat him to the man of the match award in @entity45 , but he is doing his best to make an unanswerable case here			1
in @entity25 ’s first innings he showed the home side how to exploit @entity27 conditions , pitching the ball up with just enough swing and seam movement to make driving a hazardous business			1
on sunday , he arrived at the crease with the @entity28 – and possibly the series – in the balance			0
@entity13 had just lost their seventh wicket and led by only 211			2
had @entity59 accepted a sharp but catchable head - high chance at third slip when @entity1 was on two , @entity25 would have been favourites			1
instead , he did what proper batsmen do : in the company of the lively @entity66 , he made the opposition regret their error			0
by the time he was last out , poking @entity72 to second slip , @entity1 ’s tally in this series had reached 209 runs and 11 wickets			0
on friday night he had raised a few eyebrows when he admitted his hero was another seam - bowling @entity1 – @entity79 , who enjoyed success here on @entity13 ’s tour in 2011			2
both men hail from @entity84 , a small town in the northern @entity41 state of @entity86 known for its production of cricket balls and scissors			0
it may be time another claim to fame was added to the list .			0

@entity1 has three fifties and two five - fors in first two tests
showed @entity25 bowlers how to bowl in @entity27 conditions at @entity21
@entity13 think he should have been man of the match at @entity20
