by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity2 interest at @entity3 rests with @entity4 — and the @entity6 champion has an extra incentive to deliver after two sharp volleys in his direction			1
the @entity11 ’s decision to appoint a female coach in @entity13 drew a sly dig from @entity16 @entity15 , while @entity4 ’s practice colleague on tuesday , @entity17 , came under fire over his attempt to play @entity20 for @entity21			1
on @entity4 ’s new coaching set - up with @entity13 , @entity22 - born @entity15 , who beat @entity23 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 , said : ‘ for me , i could n’t ( have a female coach ) since i do n’t think that highly of the women ’s game			1
unconventional : @entity4 has taken the bold step of naming @entity13 as his new coach questioned : the choice of @entity13 , a female , has been criticised by @entity16 @entity15 controversial : @entity15 also said he does n't think much of women 's tennis ' his mum ( @entity33 ) coached him , and she did a great job			1
but it ’s all equal rights these days			0
got to be politically correct			0
so , yeah , someone ’s got to give it a go , but it wo n’t be me			0
’ as for @entity17 , @entity2 no 2 @entity42 said the player should have his @entity20 ambitions blocked as he is already ‘ capped ’ by @entity45 , although that did n’t seem to bother @entity4 on tuesday			1
@entity17 , ranked 132 in the world , has lived in @entity21 since 2008 but represented @entity45 in three ties			2
@entity42 , ranked 139 , said : ‘ he ’s played @entity20 for a different country so i do n’t think it would be right if he played @entity20 for our country			2
it ’s like in football , he ’s been capped for another country			0
but i ’d say i ’m a better player anyway so it should n’t be a selection issue			0
’ @entity42 crashed out of @entity60 ’s 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 to @entity59			2
the @entity61 was too strong and brutally accurate , breaking @entity42 in his first service game and then dominating him , serving 10 aces , compared to just two from the @entity64			0
‘ i just did n’t get a chance to play , ’ said @entity42 , who lasted 65 minutes			2
fellow @entity64 @entity66 lasted only two minutes longer as he fell to @entity68 @entity67 , who was cheered to a 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 victory by his girlfriend @entity70			0
ineligible : @entity42 does n't believe @entity17 should be allowed to play for @entity21 at the @entity20 talented : the @entity45 has lived in @entity21 since 2008 and is in contention for a call - up to the team			1

@entity4 *replaced* coach @entity75 with @entity13
decision to name female coach has been questioned by @entity15
@entity42 upset by @entity17 's chance to play for @entity21 in @entity20
@entity2 no 2 believes he will be selected over @entity83 on talent
