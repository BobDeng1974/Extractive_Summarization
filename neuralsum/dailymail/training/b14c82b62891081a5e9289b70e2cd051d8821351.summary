by @entity0 , deputy political editor for @entity1 @entity2 this morning flatly rejected @entity4 ’s proposal to block @entity6 mps voting on @entity8 laws			1
the @entity10 leader said he was open to @entity8 - only ‘ scrutiny ’ of new laws – but insisted he did not want the @entity13 split into different classes of @entity5			1
his position threatens to torpedo the rapid timetable agreed by @entity4 to transfer sweeping new powers to @entity6 following last week ’s independence referendum			1
but the @entity10 leader accused mr @entity4 of using the constitutional crisis sparked by the @entity6 referendum to play politics			1
he said he did not support the idea of an ‘ @entity8 parliament ’ because it meant a ‘ new tier of politicians ’			2
he said : ‘ i am in favour of one @entity13 with 650 mps because , goodness , we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our @entity44 being split up and our @entity45 being split up and i want to make sure that does n’t happen			1
’ mr @entity2 added : ' i ’m not in favour of a @entity13 that becomes divided			1
so that somehow the @entity13 chamber is no longer 650 mps – you ’ve got to have one prime minister of the @entity45			0
' he insisted he was not against any reform			0
he said : ‘ i ’m not against the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation that particularly affects @entity8 by @entity5			2
’ but he said : ‘ we ca n’t do it in a back - of - the - envelope , fag packet way			1
let ’s have a proper constitutional convention			0
‘ let ’s not drive our country apart because @entity4 believes it is an opportunity for him to do it			2
let ’s keep out country together			0
’ mr @entity2 claimed mr @entity4 was ‘ learning the wrong lessons ’ from the @entity6 referendum			1
he said : ‘ i think constitutional change is important but i think i think there ’s a much bigger lesson – it ’s the economy stupid			0
forty five per cent of people tried to break up our country by voting ‘ yes ’			0
mr @entity2 traveled to the @entity74 studios at @entity75 in @entity76 this morning for the @entity78 show ‘ they thought they had nothing to lose , many of them , by saying let ’s leave the @entity45			1
does this country work for an elite few or does it work for most working people ? ’ he said the vote was a ‘ wake - up call ’ for the political establishment			0
the @entity10 leader said : ‘ people right across the @entity45 will say , @entity4 made a promise – and he ’s going to be kept to that			1
i know @entity4 will want to honour that promise			2
‘ trust in politics is sufficiently low that we ’ve got to keep our promises			0
’ he said : ‘ we ’ve got to look at all the constitutional issues that have been thrown up			0
there is a big problem , which is power has been devolved in @entity6 , power has been devolved in @entity103 but governments of both parties have failed to devolve power in @entity8			2
‘ now the first answer to that question is not to change the nature of the centralised power of @entity112 over @entity8 , it is to devolve power in @entity8			2
and that is absolutely crucial			0
’ he added : ‘ there is n’t a simple answer to this question			0
we ’ve been wrestling with this issue for 120 years			0
ever since we were talking about @entity117			0
’ mr @entity4 has insisted his plan to link further @entity6 devolution to the process of making sure only @entity8 mps can vote on @entity8 laws is necessary to address a ‘ basic unfairness ’ in the constitution			1
he called on mr @entity2 to either work together with him or explain to the people of the @entity45 why he would not tackle the ‘ fundamentally unjust ’ situation which means @entity6 mps can vote on laws which do not apply to their constituents			1
the move came after former prime minister @entity131 insisted he would make sure mr @entity132 , mr @entity2 and @entity133 leader @entity133 stick to the proposed timetable for setting out future powers for @entity6			1
mr @entity4 's insistence that the new settlement for @entity44 should go hand in hand with efforts to answer the so - called @entity141 question about the rights of @entity6 and @entity8 @entity5 at @entity112 has been met with wariness from @entity10 , which has most of @entity6 's 59 seats , although mr @entity2 has insisted the party will ensure that the timetable for further devolution will not slip			1
but deputy prime minister mr @entity133 warned that mr @entity4 's decision to link the issues could see him forced to renege on his promise to the people of @entity6			1
the cross-party consensus forged between the three leaders has shattered following mr @entity4 's announcement , which came shortly after @entity6 voters rejected independence by 55 per cent to 45 per cent			1
mr @entity4 insisted the timetable setting out the next stages of the devolution process would be met : ‘ new powers over tax , spending and welfare are on their way to @entity6			1
‘ the timetable is brisk , but achievable : a @entity167 , and draft legislation published by january			0
it would have to be passed in the next @entity44			2
’ but writing in the @entity169 he added : ‘ this moment must not just be about securing @entity6 's future in the @entity45 - and celebrating that fact - but settling other questions whose time has come			2
‘ the challenge is to make sure our @entity45 works for all nations			0
‘ millions of people in the rest of the @entity45 have been listening to these debates , watching this campaign and rightly asking : ' what will change for us ? why ca n't we have the same powers and the same rights as those in @entity6 ? ' ‘ these are questions the @entity187 itself has been asking for a long time			2
‘ why should @entity6 mps be able to vote on what is taught in @entity8 schools , to reduce spending on @entity8 hospitals , or even vary @entity8 or @entity103 income taxes , when under the new settlement @entity8 or @entity103 @entity5 would have no say in such matters in @entity6 ? ‘ it is fundamentally unjust to have the views of the people of @entity8 and @entity103 overridden in this way			1
’ @entity4 , @entity2 and @entity133 made ' a vow ' to the @entity6 people to transfer new powers to @entity205 he added : ‘ if the @entity44 will soon have a range of new powers : powers over income tax rates ; to change benefits such as housing benefit ; to increase spending , including on the @entity213 – then there is a crying need to reflect that across the @entity45			1
but mr @entity133 , writing in @entity216 , insisted there could be ‘ no ifs , no buts ’ about delivering the extra powers promised to @entity6 , and the package ‘ can not be made contingent on other constitutional reforms ’			2
he accused the @entity224 of being more concerned with the threat from @entity226 than the vow made to @entity6			0
he said : ‘ the conservatives , in their rush to protect themselves from an attack from the right , are only concerned about @entity8 votes on @entity8 matters			0
‘ of course we need a solution to this dilemma but , by appearing to link it to the delivery of further devolution to @entity6 , they risk reneging on the commitment made to the @entity6 people that , in the event of a no vote , new powers would come what may			2
‘ worse still , if the @entity187 enter into a @entity247 auction with @entity226 over ever more extreme solutions to the issue of @entity8 votes they could jeopardise the union they purport to defend			0
‘ surely we have n't fought to save our union in a vote north of the border , only to see it balkanised in @entity112 ? ’ the prime minister has reportedly invited a group of senior @entity224 to @entity256 tomorrow to discuss his plans			0
former environment secretary @entity258 accused mr @entity4 of ‘ panicky and ill - considered bargaining ’ over the offer of further powers to @entity44			1
he told @entity216 it was ‘ disgraceful ’ that the people of @entity8 , @entity103 and @entity263 had not been consulted			0
former premier mr @entity131 , who has been credited with helping to save the union following his interventions to boost the no campaign , insisted the timetable for setting out the devolution plans would be met .			0

@entity10 leader says he 's open to @entity8 - only ' scrutiny ' of law but not *vetoes*
he claims the move was drawn up on the back of a ' fag packet ' by the pm
@entity4 said if @entity6 gets new powers so should @entity8
but mr @entity2 said the proposal would mean our ' @entity44 being split up '
mr @entity2 says he 's ' not in favour of a commons that becomes divided '
@entity10 has 41 mps in @entity6 which could help it form a *majority* next year
