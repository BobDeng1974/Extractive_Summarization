a quarter of @entity1 are said to have some kind of fear of flying , from absolute terror to simply feeling uncomfortable on board a plane			1
recent air accidents , from the @entity9 crash on december 28 off the coast of @entity11 , killing 162 , to the twin @entity14 tragedies in 2014 , which killed 537 in total , have done nothing to reassure nervous fliers			0
from discussion about the roles storms play in accidents to theories about turbulence and landing plane sin high winds , there is a lot of misinformation that can needlessly worry travellers			1
so captain @entity30 , @entity32 ’ @entity31 , has explained what really happens behind some of the most common myths involved in flying			1
' @entity36 has always had a bit of mystique to it , ' @entity30 told @entity39			0
' a lot of these fears stem from a lack of knowledge			0
' it really depends on the type of weather buildup you get , ' @entity30 explains			0
' you can get storm clouds that continue on above 40,000 feet , so it may not be an option to go over those			2
' ' without a doubt , storms are best avoided , so a pilot 's first reaction will always be to fly over it - if possible - or fly around it			1
' many theories about the @entity9 crash on december 28 involved the stormy weather the plane was experiencing off the coast of @entity11 myth 2 : all thunderstorms are the same ( and planes must fly over them ) not at all ! ' in the @entity1 , we experience very different storm systems than those near the @entity92 or over @entity94 or @entity93 , ' he says			1
' generally buildups in the @entity1 are less severe			0
' ' different areas and different airports have different characteristics , and often what causes turbulence low to the ground will be topographical features			2
' if we 're going to an area of the world that 's more prone to large thunderstorms , we 're aware of it and certainly looking for it			2
' the other benefit you ’ve got is that the air traffic controllers in those areas are very much used to the weather conditions , ' he adds			0
' it 's common to them			1
' when a pilot does encounter a storm , take comfort in the fact that he or she 's spent hours practicing for it another common misconception is that planes can be ' dragged down ' by wind - but @entity30 ( left ) disagrees myth 3 : planes can be ' dragged down ' by wind while it may be common to read about a plane experiencing such phenomenon , there 's far more to it			1
' it 's a vivid description , but what it really is is a changing of wind speeds and directions , ' @entity30 explains			2
' that sort of terminology is used because of the feeling you get in your stomach , but think of it more like being on a ship in the ocean			0
' it 's just a change in wind conditions , whereas what you really want is a consistent wind			2
' pilots are just as well - trained to handle weather - related issues as they are to handle mechanical issues myth 4 : turbulence is dangerous @entity156 , an active airline pilot and author , suggests that turbulence ' is far and away the number one concern of nervous flyers '			1
however , in his ask the pilot blog , mr @entity156 says pilots consider incidents of rough air to be nothing more than ' a comfort and convenience issue , not a safety issue per se			2
annoying , but not dangerous '			0
but there is unfortunate news for nervous flyers out there - turbulence actually comes in several forms - with some much easier to detect than others			1
you 're not alone ! research shows that around 25 per cent of people have at least some fear of flying			1
but do n't worry , @entity32 also offers a @entity181 course for all you nervous flyers out there			1
the one - day course runs throughout the year at @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity192 airports			0
@entity32 ' pilots and cabin crew do a presentation in the morning , followed by a talk by a psychologist in the afternoon			1
the day concludes with nervous passengers taking a flight on a @entity32 aircraft and applying their newly - acquired skills			1
more than 45,000 people have attended over the past 28 years - and the course has a 98 per cent success rate			0

' storm turbulence and wind shear are the major weather - related factors , but there is another sort of turbulence that is regularly experienced called clear air turbulence , @entity30 says			1
' it 's less easy to detect - in daylight , it 's not visible - so we tend to employ different methods there			2
' it 's generally about forecasts , like the @entity224 forecast predictions , and one of the first elements of training is to understand and interpret weather radars			2
' there are also pilot reports , ' he adds			0
' before a pilot goes flying , they 'll look at a briefing pack and that will warn of any potential areas where they may encounter clear air turbulence			1
' and then when you 're flying , air traffic control becomes the means of letting you know if other aircraft in the area have experienced anything			2
' captain @entity156 adds : ' during turbulence , the pilots are not fighting the controls			1
' planes are designed with what we call positive stability , meaning that when nudged from their original point in space , by their nature they wish to return there			0
' the best way of handling rough air is to effectively ride it out , hands - off			0
( some autopilots have a turbulence mode that desensitizes the system , to avoid over-controlling			2
) ' it can be uncomfortable , but the jet is not going to flip upside down			0
' some airports require different approaches when a plane comes in for landing			0
pictured here : @entity273 myth 5 : some airports are very dangerous for take - offs and landings different airports have different characteristics and so , can present different concerns - including tactics for approach and takeoff - but no airport should be problematic or any pilot that 's been properly trained			1
' training is common across the board , ' @entity30 tells us			0
' so , what you would do in the event of encountering anything is the same			0
' ' i started my @entity32 flying career around the @entity294 of @entity295 , so i spent a lot of time in fairly windy conditions up there , which is quite a regular occurrence			1
' @entity298 has a big hill just off to the west of the airport and sometimes you get wind off of that that can make the approach quite bumpy			0
' we have training that 's specific to the airfield that pilots go to and we have a manual that all pilots have that they can consult			1
' if i was going to @entity298 , tomorrow , for example , and not familiar , we have training material that explains quite a lot of details , including what the wind conditions are like and if you 're more likely to experience turbulence in one particular approach to one particular runway			0
' ' we spend a lot of time training our pilots - not just in skill , but there 's also a huge amount of knowledge , which equally applies to weather - related issues as it does to things like mechanical engineering issues			1

@entity32 ' @entity31 answers all *faq*
many flyers fear turbulence , but it 's nothing to be concerned about
another common flying myth : pilots always attempt to ' fly over ' the storm
