@entity0 studied physics and philosophy at university , so when he is throwing his weight around in the colours of @entity6 , he has a fundamental grasp of the attitude he must adopt. playing on the edge , but not over it ; that is the key			1
he already knew the theory and over time – via a couple of jolting reminders – he has learned to apply it			2
the 27 - year - old lock is intelligent , a deep thinker and an assured talker			2
he is armed for a debate , as well as for the gruelling demands of his day - job			2
having made a storming start to the new @entity25 season and a strong case for @entity28 recognition , @entity0 considers the extremities of his role			1
he may have lost a few pounds , but his brief is to impose himself on the opposition			2
in the past , he has occasionally over-stepped the mark in that regard and the tag of ‘ enforcer ’ has duly been applied			2
@entity0 pictured at @entity6 's picturesque @entity38 training ground in @entity39 the second row has been one of the form players this season and is pushing for an @entity28 position @entity0 will come up against @entity28 rival @entity45 at @entity46 on sunday afternoon most occupants of the second row would embrace it , but @entity0 is wary			1
‘ i think the connotations of it are the difficult thing , ’ he said , ahead of sunday ’s showdown with @entity50 and their leading @entity28 lock , @entity45			1
‘ the term “ enforcer ” harks back to an era when rugby was a very different game ; when a bit of shoe on someone ’s shoulder was completely acceptable			1
@entity62 has changed and i am testament to that			2
@entity62 is a different game to when i started playing and you have to adapt to that			2
‘ the trouble with the term “ enforcer ” is that it harks back to an era when that sort of player ran round grabbing people by the face and throwing them around , or laying down the law under the cover of a ruck or scrum			1
that does n’t exist anymore and you ca n’t do that			2
‘ there ’s no real benefit either			0
people are so professional these days that putting in a bit of a cheap shot on someone does n’t really make a difference and you risk getting yourself cited and banned			0
so it ’s a difficult term , but i do think there ’s a place for it , in terms of being someone who takes a lead when it comes to physicality			2
that is definitely something i aim to do			0
‘ you have to impose yourself , without doing it illegally – put in a big tackle , then get up and do another one			0
when your defensive line is pushing the attack back , pushing the attack back , pushing the attack back ; you have to be the guy leading the charge			0
if anyone was to use the term “ enforcer ” about me ; that is what i would want them to mean			1
’ back in june , 2010 , when @entity28 were on tour in @entity119 , the uncapped @entity0 made a major impression on the - then national manager , @entity122			1
the former lock - enforcer saw the rookie as an emerging talent in his own image , but since then he has n’t quite taken the next step to become a fixture in the test pack			1
@entity0 of @entity6 holds off @entity130 of @entity131 in last season 's @entity133 final @entity0 makes a charge forwards for @entity28 against @entity136 at @entity137 in 2010 @entity0 looks on during an @entity28 training session held at @entity139 in 2011 to date , he has earned 12 caps but started just twice for his country , on tour in @entity143 last year while the @entity144 were in @entity119			1
his status as a regular replacement appeared to be under threat on the recent trip to @entity149 , as @entity150 made a positive impact as midweek captain , but the @entity154 skipper has been ruled out for the season and @entity0 had been outstanding for @entity6			1
when his club smashed the @entity154 45 - 0 at @entity157 last month , he was bloodied and brilliant , in front of watching @entity28 forwards coach , @entity159 , and he has maintained supreme standards , thanks in part to more mobility			1
‘ they ( @entity28 coaches ) want the same explosive qualities , but they want us to be a bit lighter and fitter , ’ he said			1
‘ after the @entity143 tour last year , the feedback from @entity28 was , “ we want you big , strong and as effective as you can be in a five - metre square			1
now the emphasis has shifted ; they still want me to be destructive , but also get my numbers up			0
that is going well for me so far – i ’ve made a fairly good account of myself in the early part of this season			0
‘ i am a very good scrummaging second row – one of the best scrummaging second rows around			2
it is great for me to be working with @entity185 , who is one of the best tightheads in @entity187 at the moment			0
so i have that string to my bow , but for the last test in @entity149 i was weighing around 127kg and now i ’m about 119			0
i ’m trying to get around the pitch a bit more			0
’ @entity0 claims a line - out for @entity6 sunday ’s game at @entity46 will act as another momentous examination of his @entity198 ambitions			1
in recent weeks , @entity0 has thrived in match - ups with @entity200 and @entity201 , now @entity202 is on his radar			1
he is driven , but wary of being side - tracked by a personal agenda			0
‘ you ca n’t just run round the pitch , following the guy , saying , “ i ’m coming after you ! ” , ’ he said			0
‘ i think i ’m on a good road			0
i ’m not the one holding the shirt – i ’m chasing someone else ’s shirt at the moment			0
i ’m third or fourth or fifth choice , but i ’ve got a possibility of getting hold of it			0
i do feel like there ’s an opportunity for someone with my skills - set to be a reigning @entity28 second row			1
’ his superb form has come in the build - up to becoming a first - time father			0
he senses he is entering a critical phase , in various ways			0
‘ it may be coincidental that things are going particularly well with @entity6 so far this season , the @entity228 is looming , we ’ve got a baby on the way and i ’m on the verge of getting established in international rugby , ’ he said			1
there ’s an awful lot going on at the moment			0
‘ i ’m very excited and aware that i ’m on the cusp of a life - changing period			0

second row @entity0 has become known for his physical approach
but the lock believes the term ' enforcer ' is *outdated* in the *modern* game
@entity0 will face @entity28 rival @entity45 on sunday
@entity6 face @entity50 at @entity46 in the final match of the weekend
