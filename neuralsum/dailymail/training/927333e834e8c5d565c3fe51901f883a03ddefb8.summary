by @entity1 reporter published : 19:29 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 05:11 est , 29 august 2012 suspicions : @entity3 died in a @entity5 military hospital in 2004 @entity5 prosecutors have launched a murder inquiry into the 2004 death of @entity9 leader @entity3			1
@entity3 died in a @entity5 military hospital in 2004 from what doctors said at the time was a stroke			1
but new evidence and pressure from his widow and a tv investigation have prompted authorities to examine the possibility he was actually poisoned			1
there have long been rumours in the @entity24 world that @entity3 was poisoned , and a @entity27 lab 's recent finding of elevated levels of a rare and highly lethal radioactive substance on @entity3 's clothing has fed those claims			1
however , the @entity32 said its findings were inconclusive and that only exhuming @entity3 's remains could bring possible clarity			2
@entity9 officials have waffled on the matter - initially approving the exhumation and then saying the matter needed more study - only further fueling suspicions			1
still , since @entity3 's death , several senior @entity9 officials have alleged that @entity44 poisoned the @entity9 leader , a charge @entity44 vehemently denied			1
testing @entity3 's bones for polonium - 210 - the substance found on his clothes - could offer the last chance to get to the bottom of @entity9 claims that their leader was poisoned , though some experts say it may already be too late for conclusive answers			1
cause of death : doctors at the @entity60 in @entity61 said he died from a stroke investigation : @entity3 's widow @entity65 , pictured here alongside then @entity9 minister of foreign affairs , @entity68 ( left ) and then @entity5 prime minister @entity69 , has reportedly filed a legal complaint into her husband 's death many have speculated that @entity3 , whose @entity75 grave is pictured here , was killed by an @entity44 spy agency scientists caution that polonium decays quickly and that an autopsy needs to be done right away			1
the findings were first broadcast by @entity24 satellite tv station @entity82 , which approached the lab on behalf of @entity3 's widow , @entity65			2
she provided the lab with his clothing and other belongings			2
when the results were released , @entity65 filed a complaint in @entity5 court asking for a murder investigation			2
the two judicial officials - who would only speak on condition of anonymity because of office rules - said a judge will be appointed to run the investigation shortly			2
the complaint is open and does not name a responsible party , as is a common practice in @entity5 courts			0
slow death : @entity104 security agent @entity103 before his death in november 2006 rumours suggesting @entity3 was poisoned by @entity44 intelligence agents have swirled around the middle east for years - fuelled by a recent investigation into a urine stain found on his underwear			1
tests found the urine had traces of @entity116 , the highly radioactive substance that killed @entity104 dissident @entity103 ( pictured ) in 2006			0
other theories have speculated that @entity3 actually died after contracting cancer , cirrhosis , or even @entity120			0
those exposed to a lethal dose of @entity123 , usually by ingesting it , die within 2 - 3 months			0
in most cases there are no serious symptoms for a week after being exposed , but nausea and fatigue would set in soon after			0
in theory , just a microgram of @entity123 - the same as a spec of dust - is enough to kill someone , due to its slowly - excreted alpha particles which affect the body 's organs			0
after ingestion , @entity123 affects the liver , kidneys , spleen , bone marrow , and gastrointestinal tract			0
serious illness would not be expected for a month , due to the amount of time it takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures			0
as the severity of the exposure develops in the body , victims usually lose hair , and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed			0
this later leads to severe diarrhea , intestinal bleeding , loss of fluids , and disturbance of electrolyte balance			0
though it takes 5 - 6 weeks to seriously affect most , the symptoms of @entity123 poisoning contrast to the case of @entity103 who fell ill the day after he was exposed			0
the @entity104 died 23 days after being exposed , an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage .			1

@entity172 will examine claims @entity9 leader was poisoned
