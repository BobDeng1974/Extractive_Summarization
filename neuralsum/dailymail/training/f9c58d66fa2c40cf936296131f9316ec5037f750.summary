one of the brothers behind @entity2 's first cereal café has written an open letter to @entity4 complaining about an excruciating interview which made a ' mockery ' of him			1
@entity8 , who founded @entity9 with his twin brother @entity10 , was challenged over selling bowls for £ 3.20 in one of the most deprived areas of @entity14			1
the hipster seemed to be caught unaware by @entity17 's questions and even claimed that the niche cafe , which opened earlier in @entity19 this week , was ' cheap '			1
but he has now responded by saying the interview was ' completely unfair ' and said the journalist did not even pay for his bowl , despite the fact he was wearing an ' overpriced @entity26 suit '			1
@entity8 ( above ) , who founded @entity9 with his twin brother @entity10 , has written an open letter to @entity4 after a ' completely unfair ' interview the cafe - owner ( left in white ) said that his prices were ' cheap ' for the area when questioned by @entity17 from @entity4 ( right ) he also jokingly pointed out he was not the man to solve the property crisis in @entity14 as he was ' too busy trying to cure @entity35 and getting @entity36 to keep her clothes on '			1
' first of all you tried to blame me for the property prices in @entity14 before attacking me with questions about poverty , ' he wrote on the café 's @entity44 page			1
' i am a small business owner and am gambling everything i have in this business and you try to make a mockery out of me			2
' i have a million things going on in my head and one of those things was about helping local charities as i am not the selfish * * * * you have made me out to be			0
' you obviously do n't understand business if you think i do n't have to put a mark - up on what i sell			0
' he said the journalist did not even pay for his bowl , despite the fact he was wearing an ' overpriced @entity26 suit ' he said he has to pay ' over the top rent ' as well as paying his 12 staff , so he either has to make a profit or run out of business			1
' maybe if i charged over £ 3 for a coffee and dodged all the taxes in this country like some cafés - the reporters would leave me alone would they , ' he said			2
the brothers , from @entity75 , opened their venture earlier this week on @entity77 - a hipster hotspot and home to a number of quirky cafes			0
after tasting one of the 120 varieties on offer , priced at £ 3.20 , mr @entity17 asked the cafe owner whether he thought it was a lot to charge for a bowl			1
the restaurateur seemed surprised by the question and responded saying , ' i think it is quite cheap for the area '			0
he was challenged by the interviewer , who pointed out that the cafe is in one of the poorest parts of @entity14 - and asked again whether £ 3 seemed like a premium price			1
mr @entity8 tried to justify the extraordinary cost and explained that many of the brands are ' imported from @entity100 '			1
the journalist then asked what this means for the people who live in the area , where the proportion of children living in poverty has nearly reached 50 per cent			1
hipster : the @entity111 cafe was founded by identical twins @entity10 ( right ) and @entity8 from @entity75 mr @entity8 responded saying , ' well , if they are poor , probably not then			1
' the cafe owner then became defensive and started asking to stop the interview because ' he does n't like the questions '			2
in his open letter , mr @entity8 said he would be sending the journalist the bill from his unpaid cereal , signing it from ' the worst person in the world '			1
he also brought up the fact that he was brought up in one of the most deprived areas in @entity75			0
' my family know all about poverty but have n't had to blame the small business owners in the area for it , i have been taught a great work ethic and have made it this far without blaming small business owners trying to better themselves and make a future for themselves			2
' niches : along with 120 varieties of cereal , the restaurant also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options deprived : the cafe , pictured above , is in @entity19 , where one in two children live in poverty the café plays on nostalgia , with limited - edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear			1
they also employ a ' mixologist ' - who combines different types of cereal for customers looking for something different			0
the cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast , lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much any time of day			2
behind the counter , brightly - coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as @entity164 and @entity165 to @entity166 and @entity167			0
when asked about his favourite cereal , mr @entity168 said : ' i really love the boo - berry , @entity172 and @entity172 – these are limited - edition @entity174 cereals that are only available one month of the year in @entity100			2
' we 've got these , but really limited - edition , so we 've only got about 20 boxes of them			0
' @entity179 and @entity17 were not available for a comment when contacted			2
imported : mr @entity8 says that the reason the cereals cost so much is because some are @entity100 brands located in east @entity14 , @entity19 has the highest rate of child poverty in the country - it reached 49 per cent this year , up from 42 per cent last year			1
it also has the second highest unemployment rate in @entity14			0
every ward has a higher proportion of people claiming out of work benefits than the @entity14 average			0
but the problems are by no means confined to the economic - @entity19 also has very high rates of long term illness and premature death			0
yet this is only half the picture			0
@entity19 also has some of the highest paid people in @entity14 , working in the financial district of @entity203 , which has @entity205 headquarters for @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
the proportion of jobs in @entity19 that are low paid is one of the smallest in the capital			0
the borough also boasts booming @entity77 , which lies at the centre of @entity2 's hipster culture and is home to a number of quirky bars and restaurants			0
at a number of these establishments , including the @entity9 , customers can expect to pay a premium for the out - of - the - ordinary experiences			1
just down the road from @entity226 is @entity228 's @entity227			0
there , visitors pay £ 5 to book a table in the cafe , which is home to a number of rescue cats .			2
