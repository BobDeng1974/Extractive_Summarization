forget global warming , the ice sheets of @entity1 face a different and a potentially more imminent threat in the form an active volcano buried deep beneath			1
researchers from @entity7 discovered the volcano - which is yet to be named - by accident in the @entity11 region of @entity1			1
swarms of tremors were detected in january 2010 and february 2011 and ash found trapped in the ice suggest it has been active for around 8,000 years			1
the new volcano was found buried beneath an ice sheet in @entity1 , close to the executive committee range of mountains , pictured			1
while trying to establish the weight of the ice sheet in the region , seismometers measured two swarms of tremors suggesting the volcano is active the as yet unnamed volcano buried beneath the ice sheet in @entity11 , @entity1 is believed to be located close to the @entity27 of extinct volcanoes			1
@entity29 is made up consisting of five major volcanoes which were found by the @entity31 in 1940			1
it is named after the @entity32			0
the mountains are called @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity27 and @entity37 and are named after members of the committee			2
further mountains , thought to be extinct volcanoes , were discovered in @entity42 in 1958			1
this range is called the @entity44 and is covered by around 6 kilometres of snow and ice			2
it is thought to be similar in size to the @entity49			2
like with the new volcano , and the executive committee range , it is unclear exactly what caused these mountains to form			2
scientists now believe that a large eruption could cause the ice sheet to melt faster than first thought and cause sea levels to rise			1
in january 2010 , a team of scientists from the @entity63 - based university set up two crossing lines of seismographs across @entity11 in @entity1			1
@entity66 , professor of earth and planetary science at @entity7 , and his team wanted to weigh the ice sheet to help create a picture of @entity1 's climate history			1
like a giant ct machine , the seismograph array used disturbances created by distant earthquakes to make images of the ice and rock deep within the region			2
the technology found two bursts of seismic events between january 2010 and march 2011 , which @entity66 ' phd student @entity83 believed were caused by a previously unseen volcano buried over half a mile ( 1 kilometre ) beneath the ice sheet			1
‘ i started seeing events that kept occurring at the same location , which was odd , ’ @entity86 said			0
‘ then i realised they were close to some mountains - but not right on top of them			0
‘ my first thought was , " okay , maybe it ’s just coincidence			2
" but then i looked more closely and realised that the mountains were actually volcanoes and there was an age progression to the range			0
' the volcanoes closest to the seismic events were the youngest ones			0
’ the tremors were weak and very low frequency , which @entity86 said suggested they were n't caused by movements in tectonic plates , associated with earthquakes			0
the tremors beneath @entity11 , pictured , were low frequency suggesting they were n't caused tectonic plates moving			2
low - magnitude tectonic tremors typically have frequencies of 10 to 20 cycles per second			0
the shaking discovered by @entity86 was 2 to 4 cycles per second making it more like volcanic activity for example , low - magnitude seismic tremors caused by tectonic movement typically have frequencies of 10 to 20 cycles per second , continued @entity86			0
the shaking she discovered was in frequencies of 2 to 4 cycles per second			0
@entity86 then used a global computer model of seismic speeds to find exactly where the seismic events were taking place			0
it is thought that the newly discovered volcano is near the @entity27 of extinct volcanoes			1
the researchers also found that almost all of the events happened between 25 to 40 kilometres below the surface			0
in january 2010 a team of scientists from @entity63 set up two crossing lines of seismographs across @entity11 in @entity1 , pictured bottom left on this map of the region			1
the researchers wanted to weigh the ice sheet to help create a picture of @entity1 's climate history and the volcano was found by accident @entity86 said this is ‘ extraordinarily deep - deep enough to be near the boundary between the @entity152 's crust and mantle , called the @entity154			1
’ this suggested to @entity86 that the tremors were n’t caused by shifting ice or glacial movement			2
it also further ruled out the tectonic theory			0
‘ a tectonic event might have a hypocentre 10 to 15 kilometres deep , but at 25 to 40 kilometres , these were way too deep , ’ @entity86 said			0
this led @entity86 and her colleague to conclude the tremors and the waveforms they created looked like @entity170 earthquakes , or @entity171 , which occur in volcanic areas			0
the seismologists also talked to @entity1 experts @entity174 and @entity176 from the @entity177			2
‘ their best guess is that it came from @entity35 , an existing volcano near @entity34			0
but that is also interesting because scientists had no idea when @entity35 was last active , and the ash layer sets the age of the eruption at 8,000 years ago			1
‘ ‘ most mountains in @entity1 are not volcanic , ’ @entity66 said			2
‘ but most in this area are			0
is it because @entity42 and @entity1 are slowly drifting apart ? we do n't know exactly			2
but we think there is probably a hot spot in the mantle here producing magma far beneath the surface			0
’ @entity34 , pictured , is part of the @entity27 in @entity11 and is the last volcano in the chain to rise above the surface of the ice			1
the group of seismologists detected the new volcanic activity beneath the ice around 30 miles north of @entity34 ‘ people are n't really sure what causes @entity171 , ' @entity86 continued			1
‘ it seems to vary by volcanic complex , but most people think it 's the movement of magma and other fluids that leads to pressure - induced vibrations in cracks within volcanic and hydrothermal systems			0
’ @entity86 added that the volcano will ‘ definitely ’ erupt in the future but ca n’t be sure when			0
such a subglacial eruption would cause enough heat flow to melt a substantial part of ice sheet			1
‘ the volcano will create millions of gallons of water beneath the ice - many lakes full , ’ said @entity66			1
this water will cause surrounding streams and sea levels to rise			0
@entity86 added , though , that only an enormous eruption - one that released a thousand times more energy than a typical eruption - would be strong enough to breach the ice above the volcano			1
the findings are published in the @entity237 journal .			0

the volcano is buried *1km* beneath the ice sheets of @entity1
swarms of tremors were detected in january 2010 and february 2011
it was found near the extinct volcanoes of the @entity27
@entity248 found trapped in the ice came from an eruption 8,000 years ago
the volcano could cause the ice sheet to melt faster than first thought
