@entity0 leader @entity0 said there were times , including at airports and in schools , where a full religious veil was not appropriate religious veils should not be allowed in the classroom , @entity0 suggested today as @entity0 called for a national debate on the issue			1
the deputy prime minister said it was ‘ inappropriate ’ for students to wear a full veil during lessons because teachers needed to see their faces			1
and @entity17 went further , saying @entity18 believed bans could be imposed in ' other institutions '			0
it came after @entity23 mp @entity22 called for a ban in all schools because ' they make women invisible			1
the issue has erupted after a college ’s u-turn last week on banning students wearing veils			1
a judge is due to decide today on whether a @entity35 woman can stand trial while wearing one			1
mr @entity0 was careful to say he did not want a legal ban on the wearing of religious items of clothing			2
he told the @entity41 : ‘ i think there is a debate going on already in households and communities up and down the country			0
‘ my own view , very strongly held , is that we should n’t end up like other countries issuing edicts or laws from parliament telling people what they should or should not wear			0
i think it is very un-british to start telling people what pieces of clothing they should wear			0
‘ i think there are exceptions to that as far as the full veil is concerned - security at airports for instance			1
it is perfectly reasonable for us to say the full veil is clearly not appropriate there			2
‘ and i think in the classroom , there is an issue of course about teachers being able to address their students in a way where they can address them face to face			2
i think it is quite difficult in the classroom to be able to do that			0
’ ' i do think there is an issue with teachers in the classroom … that might be an area where a full veil might be inappropriate			2
' @entity93 minister @entity92 suggested the government should consider banning @entity35 girls and young women from wearing the veil in public places			1
his intervention was sparked by a row over the decision by @entity102 to drop a ban on the wearing of full - face veils amid public protests			1
a student at @entity102 wears a full veil after the college reversed its position which previously banned students from wearing niqabs so they could be ' easily identifiable at all times ' mr @entity92 said he was ‘ instinctively uneasy ’ about restricting religious freedoms , but he added there may be a case to act to protect girls who were too young to decide for themselves whether they wished to wear the veil or not			1
‘ i am instinctively uneasy about restricting the freedom of individuals to observe the religion of their choice , ’ he told the @entity119			0
‘ but there is genuine debate about whether girls should feel a compulsion to wear a veil when society deems children to be unable to express personal choices about other areas like buying alcohol , smoking or getting married			0
‘ we should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression			0
’ @entity138 said the prime minister believes that schools should have the right to set their own uniform policies			1
at a regular @entity145 briefing , the spokesman suggested other institutions could also look to ban veils			2
he said : ' i actually think there is a position of principle here , which is around the ability of institutions such as schools , to set a , in the case of schools , clearly a uniform policy , so i think that is already there			0
he added : ' the prime minister does n't take the view , does n't believe , that @entity162 should legislate on what people do and do n't wear on their local high street			1
' nonetheless , that is not incompatible with institutions having dress codes			0
schools are an example but it is for institutions to take those decisions			0
' there are legal frameworks within which all institutions operate			0
' last week , @entity102 was forced to drop its ban on students wearing full facial veils on its campus after a protest			1
a 9,000 - name petition saw its principal back down on its policy after it was accused of ‘ @entity186 ’			0
the ban stopped @entity35 pupils wearing the niqab , the full facial veil in which only the eyes are visible , or the burqa where the eyes are covered with mesh			1
but the college was attacked for its stance by local councillors , mps and the @entity199			0
however @entity201 mp dr @entity22 said some women found the niqab ‘ deeply offensive ’ and should not be accused of being bigoted for criticising them			1
the @entity23 mp posted a string of controversial tweets in light of recent events concerning full - face veils she made the comments on @entity212 following a college ’s u-turn last week on banning students wearing veils and before a judge is due to decide today on whether a @entity35 woman can stand trial while wearing one			1
dr @entity22 , the mp for @entity223 in @entity224 , said : ‘ the niqab should be banned within schools and colleges ; how on earth do they promote equality when they collude with making women invisible ? ’ she also wrote : ‘ a general ban on the niqab simply wo n’t happen in the @entity235 but that does n’t mean that it should be endorsed by schools or courts			1
’ her comments were met by a backlash from supporters of the veil , but she stood her ground against the angry criticism			2
the mp said her view was ‘ not bigotry ’ and that this accusation was ‘ the cudgel used to repress debate ’			0
she added : ‘ feminists should be allowed to say that they find the niqab deeply offensive without being accused of being bigoted or islamaphobic			2
’ among the tweets hitting back at the mp ’s comments were from @entity35 commentator @entity253			0
he said : ‘ poor @entity22 ’s twitter feed has become a total car crash of bigotry , @entity186 , historical ignorance and exceptionalism			2
’ he added : ‘ do you accept and support the right of a woman to dress as she wishes ? ’ one woman asked the mp on @entity212 : ‘ how about asking a woman who wears niqab what she thinks about her freedom ? or does her opinion not matter ? ’ @entity93 minister @entity92 said there needed to be a national debate on the issue of veils the wearing of veils in public faces another test in court today			1
a judge at @entity276 in @entity277 allowed a woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , to plead not guilty while wearing her veil last month			1
she argued she was unable to remove the face covering in the presence of men for religious reasons , but as a compromise she allowed a female police officer in a room next to the courtroom to lift it to check her identity			2
the judge will now decide on whether she will be able to wear her veil during her trial for intimidating a witness , as he feared jurors would not be able to see her facial expressions during questioning			2
a veil ban at the @entity299 college had been in place for eight years without protest			1
but an anonymous prospective student complained to her local paper , saying that she was being discriminated against , and the publicity sparked an online campaign			0
@entity102 is believed to be the only college in the @entity235 to have banned the niqab			1
some 43 per cent of its 44,000 students come from ethnic groups that are non white			0
an online petition was signed by 9,000 people , amid rumours that the college was also planning to ban prayers on its premises			0
the college was forced to amend its policy , which also covered hoodies and hats , which had been brought in to make sure students were always ‘ easily identifiable ’ .			0

deputy prime minister said veil is also not appropriate at airport security
dr @entity22 for @entity223 , @entity224 , say schools ' collude with making women invisible ' if they allow niqab
comments come after @entity102 reverses ban on full - face veils after students protest
earlier this week a judge allowed a woman to give evidence in court wearing a burqa for the first time
