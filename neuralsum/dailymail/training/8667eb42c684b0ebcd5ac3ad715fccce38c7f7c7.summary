a @entity1 man was left stunned after he went to the doctor experiencing stomach aches and blood in his urine – only to discover that he was a woman on his period			1
the married 44 - year - old man from @entity10 province , @entity1 , visited his local doctor with his wife in @entity13 where he made the shocking discovery that he had , all along , in fact been a woman			1
after a full examination , doctors discovered that he had a full set of female reproductive organs along with a penis - which he said had given him an active sex life with his wife of ten years			1
tests : a man in @entity10 province , @entity1 made the shocking discovery that he was a woman @entity29 : doctors told him that his stomach ache was actually his monthly period but doctors doubted this			1
doctors found that his genitals were different from other men and he did not possess an @entity39			1
a spokesman for @entity41 of @entity13 said that doctors doubted that mr @entity43 was a female at first			1
he said : ‘ he was wearing men 's clothes with short hair , so we did n’t think that he would be a female at the beginning ’			1
however , mr @entity43 said that he had known that something was wrong with him after he found himself constantly feeling fatigued with swollen face and legs			2
even worse , he constantly found blood in his urine			0
a ct scan soon revealed that he had a uterus and ovaries			0
female reproductive system : the man had a full set of female reproductive organs along with a penis meanwhile , a chromosome examination showed that mr @entity43 had a pair of @entity67 sex chromosomes , making him genetically female			1
the condition of being ' intersex ' affects one in every 2,000 births in the @entity71 ( although figures may be much higher ) and there are an estimated 30,000 intersex people in the @entity71			0
there are several known abnormalities that can lead to specific sexual ambiguity			0
so called ' xx male syndrome ' occurs in people who have two x chromosomes - one of which contains a significant amount of genetic material from a y chromosome			0
these people appear to be male , but are , in fact , genetically female			1
typically , they will possess male sex organs , but these will often be underdeveloped			1
they will also often develop breasts and maintain a high - pitched speaking voice			0
in fact , biologists now recognise a host of conditions , both genetic and otherwise , which are labelled under the umbrella term ' intersex ' - which replaces older terms such as ' hermaphrodite '			0
intersex people may be genetically female , but physiologically male			2
some will be true hermaphrodites , producing both eggs and sperm			0
mr @entity43 was also suffering from @entity102 , a genetic disease that causes the adrenal glands to swell due to a decrease in stress hormone and an increase in male sex hormones			2
a lump was later surgically removed from his adrenal glands			0
this type of medical case is extremely rare and doctors have not confirmed whether mr @entity43 was a hermaphrodite or intersex			2
but he did appear to have two types of genitalia			0
doctors said it was too late for mr @entity43 to seek medical treatment for his unusual problem as it was only effective for younger people .			2
