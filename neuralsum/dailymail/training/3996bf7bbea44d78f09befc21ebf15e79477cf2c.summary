click here to read the reasons behind @entity3 ' training ground row with @entity4 @entity3 is n’t your typical @entity5 abroad			1
he is n’t in @entity7 just to party			0
he ’s here , in @entity9 , to rebuild his once burgeoning reputation			0
the defender once heralded as the undisputed successor to @entity15 ’s @entity14 right back slot has had 18 months to forget			1
there are various theories to explain @entity18 ’s fall from grace			2
injury is one ; the form of @entity22 another			2
the 49 - year - old believed that the colour brought bad luck			1
his failure to convince @entity26 manager @entity42 of his abilities is , perhaps , the most pertinent reason			1
speaking for the first time since calling time on his 12 - year career at @entity26 , @entity18 provided his own account of why he feels his career has hit a brick wall			1
‘ i do n’t have any bad feelings towards the club			0
they put me on the map and gave me a chance when i was 17 , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ but i do have bad feelings towards the playing time ( i was given )			0
for any player , when you ’re not playing it ’s frustrating			0
when @entity61 was in charge , he would rotate the full backs			0
‘ when we won the league in 2012 , i played more than @entity22			2
so , i feel as though i could have been given more chances to play ( under @entity42 )			2
i felt like i had improved and that i could do it at that level			0
’ @entity18 , who also revealed his hope of breaking back into @entity14 contention , admits he has doubts over whether @entity26 ’s current youngsters will ever emulate his achievement of breaking into the first team			1
@entity77 , a @entity78 , is the only ‘ club - trained ’ player in @entity26 ’s @entity80 squad			1
‘ it ’s going to be hard for them to come through			0
if you look at the squad now there ’s 22 international players , ’ @entity18 said			1
‘ you ’re going to have to be extra special to get through			0
hopefully , the new facilities they are building will help to bring young players through			2
it would be nice to see more coming from the academy , but the standard ’s pretty high now			0
‘ the manager [ @entity42 ] always said if you ’re good enough , you ’ll get a chance			1
i hope he sticks to his word			0
but i decided i wanted to go somewhere where i had the opportunity to be no 1			0
’ @entity3 poses with the club 's shirt at the @entity101 in @entity9 @entity3 on the training pitch with his @entity24 team - mates ahead of their @entity105 clash @entity3 said that when he spoke to representatives from @entity24 they made him feel very welcome he ’s got that chance now , amid the plush surroundings of @entity110			1
the prospect of playing on the same flank as @entity115 ’s @entity114 sensation @entity113 this season has re-invigorated the defender			0
@entity18 was chirpy at his official unveiling at the @entity101 ; his difficult 18 months now a bygone chapter			2
his season - long loan to @entity24 , however , has come at considerable emotional expense			1
facts and figures show that @entity3 ' career has taken a down turn at the @entity126 the 26 - year - old is very close to his family ; leaving them back in @entity14 has been a huge wrench , according to those close to @entity18			1
but he wanted it this way			0
he could easily have stayed in the @entity134 — his comfort zone			2
@entity18 had a firm loan offer from @entity137 , who made their interest known in the defender just hours after their opening - day defeat by @entity143			1
likewise , @entity18 could have easily sat back and picked up his £ 70,000 - per - week salary at the @entity126 , knowing full well he ’d have virtually no chance of playing and that his contract ran out at the end of the season			1
@entity3 did say that he was grateful to @entity26 for giving him a chance when he was 17 @entity3 took a pay cut to join @entity24 so he could get appearances instead of being a substitute sunday @entity105 ( @entity153 ) september 18 @entity154 ( @entity153 , @entity155 ) september 21 @entity156 ( a ) september 24 @entity157 ( @entity153 ) september 28 @entity158 ( a ) october 2 @entity159 ( a , @entity155 ) but his mind was made up			1
the move to @entity24 had been in the pipeline for three weeks			2
as discussions between the @entity28 club and @entity18 ’s representatives progressed , the more the defender ’s eyes widened			2
‘ i had interest from @entity171 clubs , @entity26 offered me a five - year contract to stay , but for me i wanted to come somewhere i could make a fresh start , ’ he said			1
‘ a lot of players in @entity14 just want to stay but i wanted to play abroad , i ’ve always wanted to do that			1
this was the best option for me			0
i watched @entity7 football on tv , the pace looks slower , but more technical			0
‘ teams look after the ball a bit better			0
that ’s what @entity7 is known for and tactically i want to improve my game			0
‘ for example , sometime in games you can fizzle games out , i learned that under @entity61			0
i learned a lot from @entity61 and he is one of the reasons i came here , too			0
@entity18 squares up to @entity4 during their time together at @entity26 - the pair had actually come to blows on the training ground a few weeks earlier ( below ) @entity196 holds back a furious @entity3 as he tries to get at @entity4 during a training session @entity3 decided to leave @entity26 having been there since 2001 but even with the @entity9 sun beating down on him yesterday , rainy @entity198 was never too far from his thoughts			1
‘ @entity202 was always going to be sad after 12 years , it was hard for me to leave because i know nothing else but @entity26 , ’ he said			2
with the influx of big - money foreign signings , you wonder where @entity26 ’s next @entity3 is coming from .			1
