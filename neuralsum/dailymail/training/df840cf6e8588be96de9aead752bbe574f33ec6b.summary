a cheap form of @entity1 that uses baking soda is to be trialled in @entity3 next month			1
it costs a third of the price of standard treatment as it does not involve costly drugs and equipment			0
in conventional @entity1 , the embryo is grown a mixture of nutrients in a large incubator with expensive carbon dioxide pumped through			1
a revolutionary @entity1 , called simplifed culture system and costs £ 1,000 , will be trialled in @entity3 next month but scientists from @entity18 in @entity19 found they could get the same effect using citric acid and sodium bicarbonate – baking soda			1
this enables the embryo to be grown in a far smaller incubator the size of a shoe box			1
the technique – called simplified culture system – has already resulted in the birth of 18 healthy babies in @entity33			2
as part of the trial next month , 50 @entity3 women under the age of 37 will pay £ 1,000 to undergo the procedure			1
the treatment will initially only be available privately but doctors hope that if successful , it will eventually be offered on the @entity41			2
@entity1 costs at least £ 3,000 meaning this version is a third of the price			0
scientists found baking soda - or sodium bicarbonate - created same effect as conventional @entity1 methods dr @entity50 , director of the @entity51 , the charity overseeing it , said : ‘ the initial focus was to develop a simplified low - cost procedure to provide @entity1 in the developing world			2
‘ however , the public funding for @entity1 in the @entity3 is very limited and by reducing costs significantly through this method we can offer a realistic opportunity to end the current postcode lottery because more cycles could be offered within the existing @entity41 budget constraints			0
’ the trial in @entity33 showed that the procedure had the same success rates of conventional @entity1 - about 34 per cent			0
it has led to the births of 18 babies and six women are pregnant			0
in the paper , published in march , lead researcher professor @entity70 wrote : ‘ while the demand for @entity1 has shown no diminution since its formal introduction nearly 35 years ago , neither have treatment costs , which have progressively increased			0

regular @entity1 uses mixture of nutrients , large incubator and carbon dioxide
scientists found they could get same effect using citric acid and baking soda
it enables embryo to be grown in smaller incubator the size of a shoe box
technique has already resulted in birth of 18 healthy babies in @entity33
next month 50 @entity3 women under 37 will pay £ 1,000 for trial procedure
initially available privately but doctors hope to offer it on @entity41 if successful
