by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:31 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 8 august 2013 the @entity3 politician under fire for referring to ‘ @entity5 ’ today offered up yet another explanation for his remarks – he was talking about an antelope			1
@entity9 faced repeated accusations of racism after condemning foreign aid being sent to ‘ @entity5 ’ , seen as a derogatory reference to @entity14			1
but he insisted that a bongo is a ‘ white antelope , lives in the forest , there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever ’			1
critics were quick to point out that the bongo antelope is not white , it is brown			1
he was slapped on the wrist by party leaders after he was secretly recorded making what critics immediately branded racist comments			1
he told supporters in the @entity44 that foreign leaders who received aid spent the money on ‘ @entity49 sunglasses , apartments in @entity51 , @entity52 and all the rest of it ’			2
in the recording , the mep for @entity56 and the @entity57 says : ‘ how we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month when we ’re in this sort of debt to @entity5 is completely beyond me			1
’ @entity3 leader @entity62 ordered mr @entity9 to stop using the term and the under - fire @entity9 issued a carefully - worded statement apologising if he had caused ‘ genuine offence ’			1
however , in a fresh round of media interviews he again sought to explain his choice of words			0
he told @entity72 ’s @entity71 : ‘ these have been interpreted as racist comments , they are not racist at all			2
‘ if anybody would care to take the trouble to get out the @entity79 dictionary this morning and look it up , you ’ll find that bongo is a white antelope , lives in the forest , there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever			1
‘ @entity5 is the land of the antelope			1
‘ some people have interpreted it as a racist remark but there is no evidence in any dictionary at all that it implies racism			1
’ @entity5 : mr @entity9 insisted he was referring to the rare @entity93 , seen here at @entity94 in @entity95 there is just a few dozen of the bongo antelopes left in @entity99			1
they are hunted for their reddish - brown coat with white stripes , and their long spiralled horns			0
there are thought to be only around 100 left in the wild			0
the @entity107 has listed the the western or lowland bongo on the ‘ near threatened ’ list			2
in addition to the threat posed by poachers , numbers of fallen as logging wiped out their habitats			0
but his explanation was dismissed by @entity119 's foreign aid spokesman @entity118			1
she said : ' it ’s offensive for sure and the public have shown that they find it offensive so i think mr @entity9 should apologise , it would do him good , it would do his party good			1
' this is a party that is trying to show that they are reasonable but his comments are completely unacceptable and objectionable and that ’s what the public are saying			0
' @entity62 ought to step in and sort this out because this just shows what his party is really about and it ’s not a party that ’s inclusive , it ’s an intolerant party and it ’s defined by mr @entity9			1
' there are legitimate views about how we should spend aid and so on but i do n’t think the vast majority of people accept the term bongo bongo land - that is offensive			1
' the 63 - year - old has spent the last 24 hours fielding questions about the comments , insisting he has the broad support of the public away from the ‘ @entity154 bubble ’			2
his office has revealed 3,000 emails since the storm erupted and ‘ half a dozen ’ disagree with him , he claimed			0
repeatedly quizzed on whether he is a racist , mr @entity9 told @entity160 interviewer @entity159 : ‘ move on , there ’s a good fellow			1
if you ’re not going to move on to serious issues , i ’m not going to continue – i ca n’t be bothered with it			0
’ he then tore off his earpiece and stormed off			2
it was an abrupt ending to a day of @entity169 farce as mr @entity9 engaged in a whirlwind tour of radio and television studios , repeatedly defending himself and making the case against overseas aid			1
going : mr @entity9 starts to get annoyed during interview with @entity160 ... going : the mep whips off his earpiece ... gone : and waves goodbye to interviewer asked by the @entity178 yesterday where ‘ @entity5 ’ was , mr @entity9 said : ‘ i do n’t know where @entity179 is either – there is no such place of course is there ? like the @entity185			1
where is the @entity185 ? ’ later he suggested : ‘ it might have been misconstrued by president @entity189 , he may have thought i was talking about him			0
‘ if he is offended , i shall write to his excellency in short order and say , “ i ’m very sorry i was n’t talking about you ”			0
@entity194 is president of @entity195 , not @entity196			0
@entity197 weighed into the row today , branding mr @entity9 's remarks ' offensive ' and defending the use of @entity204 taxpayers ' money for overseas aid			1
he said : ' i think it is an offensive remark anyway , but what i think is wrong is this sort of " stop the world , i want to get off " approach just does n't work			1
unrepentant : mr @entity9 , his wife @entity211 and their terrier chippy yesterday ' @entity204 is a very open international country			1
the problems elsewhere come and visit us			0
so it makes sense i think to have an overseas aid programme that helps solve these problems at source , ' he told @entity223			2
however , mr @entity9 stood by his central argument that it was wrong to send @entity204 taxpayers ’ money to foreign countries while making cuts at home			1
he claimed : ‘ we ’re closing our @entity232 wings of our hospitals , we ’re cutting our police , we ’re cutting our defence , we do n’t have enough dialysis machines and we 're sending £ 1 billion a month away without even an audit trail			0
‘ we do n’t even know where most of it goes			0
it ’s treason and it ’s a disgrace and that ’s the point i made in my speech which incidentally was n’t clandestine recorded , it was an open meeting in @entity242 and lots of people were there - there was nothing clandestine about it			2
” asked if he has been pressured to resign by the @entity3 leadership , mr @entity9 replied : ' @entity249 no , not with the amount of support that i ’ve had - it ’s massive			1
' what i have promised @entity62 is i wo n’t use that phraseology in the future so it ca n’t be misinterpreted and i ’m quite happy to obey that rule			2
' the son of a @entity260 fighter pilot , mr @entity9 – known to friends as ‘ @entity262 ’ – grew up in @entity263 and spent 40 years working as an economist in the @entity265			1
he has been married to @entity211 , a physiotherapist who hails from @entity266 , for nearly 30 years			2
mr @entity9 drifted into politics after being asked to write a research note on the single currency in the mid- 1990s			1
‘ i gave it ten years before it started to inwardly collapse , ’ he recalls			2
‘ i ’ve been proved right in spades			0
’ mr @entity62 , then a @entity265 colleague and drinking companion , persuaded him to join the party			0
he was elected as an mep in 2004			0
men are from @entity277 and women are from @entity279			0
or in @entity9 's case , men are better at reversing cars while women can find condiments in the pantry and fret about wet towels left on beds			1
the bowler - hat wearing 63 - year - old as gained a reputation for his outspoken views			2
his latest musings on the differences between the sexes emerged in an article railing against setting quotes for the number of women on the boards of @entity301 companies			0
mr @entity9 argued that women have a ' genetic predisposition ' to prioritise family over working hard			2
' most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man , most men can reverse a car better than a woman , ' he said in an article			0
' men and women care about different things on a micro-scale			0
leaving the lavatory seat up , wet towels on the bed and the top left off the toothpaste will drive a wife mad			0
' a man simply can not understand what the problem is			0
most wives do not regard putting petrol in the car as any part of their responsibility			0
' men can not see the point in making the bed if you are going to get back in it tonight			2
' he also boasted of being ' just about as @entity338 ' as a man can be			0
' i am not a ' new man ' , would not be caught dead at the birth of a baby and [ would be ] happy to punch the first man who tries to steal my beer , ' he said in the article last month			0
he also lashed out at modern feminism ' spawned in the bra burning 1970s by rather shrill , bored , middleclass women of a certain physical genre '			0
he said they represented few women but are now supported by ' the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach ' .			0

@entity9 *confused* why ' @entity5 ' might be seen as racist
insists the dictionary shows a ' bongo ' is an antelope living in @entity14
' i *'m* 63 , that 's the sort of phraseology we used years *ago* , ' @entity9 said
he stormed off @entity160 when repeatedly asked if he was racist
he called aid programmes ' treason ' when the @entity204 is making cuts
@entity197 condemns ' offensive ' remarks and defends aid spending
