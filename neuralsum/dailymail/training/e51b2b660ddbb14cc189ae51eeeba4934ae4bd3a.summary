@entity0 claimed @entity1 is obsessed with his own achievements			1
@entity1 ripped off his @entity9 shirt and posed for the cameras after scoring in the @entity12 final victory last month			1
i ’m more about winning as a team			1
he wants to have his moments			0
i ’ve won player of the year , it ’s nowhere near as good as winning a trophy with @entity2			1
’ meanwhile , @entity0 is convinced that there is nothing to fear from @entity34 pairing @entity33 and @entity35 , who @entity13 will face in their @entity6 opener in @entity37			1
‘ if i ’m being honest , when you play a high tempo they have struggled , ’ he added			2
‘ the @entity43 league is nowhere near the tempo of the @entity45			0
even when we played @entity47 , with @entity48 and @entity49 as centre halves , they really struggled when we played a high tempo			0
if we can do that we can give them problems			0
’ previous : @entity1 gives then @entity2 team - mate @entity0 some stick after his sending off in @entity55 public enemy no 1 : @entity1 winks at a team - mate after @entity0 's marching orders @entity0 has convinced himself that this @entity13 team is better than the ‘ golden generation ’ who reached the quarter - final in 2006 or the decrepit 2010 team beaten 4 - 1 by @entity65 in @entity66			1
‘ the @entity43 players should be looking at us and how they can control our team , ’ he added			2
‘ we ’re not really too focused on @entity70			0
‘ he has been a fantastic player and @entity71 have some great players , but so have we			0
‘ they should be more worried about our team			0
it is exciting and the young players bring a lot of energy and excitement			0
you can see with @entity80 and @entity81 that there ’s no fear with them			0
they ’ll be good players , big players for us			0
‘ this is probably the best squad of players i ’ve been involved with since i ’ve been with @entity13			1
’ the centre of attention : @entity1 poses after scoring a penalty in the @entity12 final touching down : @entity1 and his team - mates arrived in @entity93 on wednesday @entity0 has done so much in his career , winning five @entity45 titles and the @entity12 with @entity2			1
incredibly , he has yet to score at a @entity6			2
‘ if you look at my record in the @entity6 qualifiers i had a pretty good record ( seven goals )			2
‘ that ’s what i have to do at the @entity6			2
i want to score goals and help @entity13 be successful , but i honestly feel better than i have done for years			2
‘ i ’m ready for this tournament and i know if i play my game i will do well			1
’ @entity107 test : @entity71 are a tough team , but they should be worried about @entity13 too , @entity0 says defensive rock ? @entity71 's @entity110 ( left ) challenges @entity35 during a training session doing well here means supplying goals and scoring them as @entity13 negotiate a tricky group involving @entity71 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
although @entity0 is yet to get off the mark at a @entity6 , he is one goal behind equalling @entity119 ( 40 goals ) and 10 behind the great sir @entity121 in an @entity13 shirt			1
‘ at my age i should break the record , but i just want to keep playing and trying to score			0
if i can get to sir @entity121 ’s record it would be a massive achievement and i would be absolutely delighted			0
’ when he gets there , everyone will have a view on it .			0
