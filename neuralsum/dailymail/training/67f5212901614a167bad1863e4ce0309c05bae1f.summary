by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 24 october 2013 the most dangerous killer highways in @entity2 are revealed today in a chilling new accident road - map of @entity2			1
the study , which colour - codes roads according to their level of risk , also reveals that drivers are now seven times more likely to crash on an a-road than a motorway			1
that risk has risen significantly from a six-fold gap just four years earlier			2
@entity14 : the map highlights the most dangerous places to drive in the country travel on a single - carriageway is also three times riskier than on a dual carriageway , according to the study			1
the report and ‘ @entity24 ’ reveal that the most dangerous stretch of road in @entity2 is seven miles of single - carriageway @entity27 from @entity28 to @entity29 , which has seen 44 fatal and serious crashes between 2007 and 2011			1
it is followed by nine miles of the @entity32 between the @entity33 ( @entity34 ) and the @entity35 in the @entity36 where four - year fatalities and serious injuries have increased from 18 to 25			0
third place in the a-road accident league table is 13 miles of the @entity41 near junction 13 of the @entity43 near @entity44 in @entity45			0
twenty - four people were killed or seriously injured there in each four - year period			0
the dangers for drivers on a-roads away from urban areas have been highlighted in a @entity54 survey which gives a risk rating to every road in the country			1
the detailed survey looked at 28,000 miles of @entity2 motorways and a-roads outside major urban areas to create a colour - coded ‘ @entity24 ’ covering every major highway in @entity2			1
danger zone : the @entity27 and @entity32 , shown on the map in black , are the two most dangerous stretches of road in @entity2 the most dangerous high - risk roads are black , medium high risk roads are red , down to the safest , low - risk roads in green			1
the report says although these major roads make up just 11 per cent of the road network they carry 56 per cent of all traffic			0
it shows that vehicles running off the road account for nearly a third ( 30 per cent ) of all deaths on these roads while crashes at junctions are the most common accidents leading to serious injury			2
the report reveals that for the period 2007 - 11 the risk to road users was seven times greater on single carriageway a-roads than motorways			1
in the 2002 - 2006 period this figure was six-fold			0
and while almost one in ten ( 9 per cent of motorways ) are rated in the ‘ low risk ’ category , almost all ( 97 per cent ) of single carriageway a-roads are @entity96 region , the highest risk of death and serious injury on motorways and a-roads is in the @entity36 , and the lowest in the @entity101 and the poll revealed			1
the most improved region is the @entity104 , with a 30 per cent fall in risk			0
more than one in five ( 21 per cent ) of fatal crashes and serious crashes on non-urban a-roads involve pedestrians or cyclists , with one in ten being head - on collisions , and one in 12 ( 8 per cent ) shunts			1
risky : the @entity27 was ranked the most dangerous road in @entity2 the single - lane road is only seven miles long , but sees an average of more than 10 fatal or serious accidents a year			1
some 1,754 people were killed on @entity2 ’s roads in 2012			2
but on average , 4 people are killed or seriously injured on each mile of motorway and a roads outside major urban areas each decade			0
motorcyclists make up just 1per cent of traffic but one in five ( 21per cent ) of fatal and serious crashes on @entity2 ’s motorways and a roads			1
the report shows ' the dominance of crashes at junctions leading to serious trauma and of death from running off the road			0
’ but it also highlights improvements which could reduce the carnage including removing roadside hazards such as trees , rigid poles or lighting columns and introducing interactive warning signs , anti-skid surfacing and road studs			0
at junctions , crash risks could be reduced by speed limits better suited to the conditions , improved road layout and signing , and by resurfacing roads with high - friction treatments to reduce skidding			0
risk : the study found that @entity158 were more dangerous than motorways , and single carriageways more deadly than dual carriageways the report notes how there has been a ‘ remarkable ’ 70 per cent drop in serious crashes – saving 250 fatal and serious injury crashes – on the ten most improved roads across @entity2			1
the most improved road is a seven - mile stretch of the @entity170 at @entity171 , where changes to speed limits , warning signs , and other improvements saw the number of deaths and serious injuries over a four year period drop from 31 to just four - a drop of 87 per cent			0
second-most improved was a six - mile section of the @entity182 at junction 44 ( @entity184 ) where deaths and serious injuries over four years dropped from 24 to 5 – or 79 per cent			2
the roads were assessed using measures developed by the @entity188 ( @entity188 ) , whose chairman @entity189 said : ’ the @entity2 public knows the safety rating of the cars they ’re buying but not their roads			1
' our @entity188 risk maps give an objective view of where people are being killed or seriously injured on a road network and where their crash risk is greatest			2
’ the ‘ @entity207 ’ uses the most up - to - date crash and traffic data from the national road injury and accidents database provided by the @entity206			0
it includes all crashes resulting in fatal or serious injuries during the data periods 2002 - 2006 and 2007 - 2011 inclusive			2
1,754 people were killed on @entity2 ’s roads in 2012			2
11,457 were killed on @entity2 roads in the 5 year survey period 2007 - 2011 , compared with 16,533 in the previous 5 years - a drop of 31 per cent			1
the 28,0000 - mile network of motorways and a roads outside major urban areas analysed in this report represents just 11 per cent of @entity2 ’s road length - but carries 56 per cent of traffic and more than half ( 51 per cent ) of all deaths			2
motorways and dual carriageways have seen the greatest improvement with a 24 per cent reduction in the survey			0
the improvement for single carriageways is 18per cent			0
on average , four people are killed or seriously injured on each mile of motorway and a-roads outside major urban areas each @entity238 the 2007 - 2011 data period , single carriageway a-roads are seven times more risky than motorways			1
in the 2002 - 2006 period this figure was six			0
travel on single carriageways is three times more risky than dual carriageways			0
62 per cent of fatal and serious crashes occur on single carriageway a-roads , 12 per cent on duals , 15 per cent on mixed single / dual and 11 per cent on motorways			1
the most common crashes on motorways and a-roads leading to death are run - offs ( 30 per cent )			0
the most common crashes leading to either death or serious injury occur at junctions ( 36 per cent )			0
21 per cent of fatal and serious crashes involved pedestrians or cyclists ; 10 per cent were head - ons and 8 per cent shunts			0
22 per cent of fatal crashes involved pedestrians or cyclists ; 19 per cent were head - ons and 6 per cent shunts			1
99 per cent of motorways are rated in the ‘ low risk ’ category ; 97 per cent of single carriageways are not			2
the @entity2 economy loses more than 2 per cent of @entity267 in road crashes			2
@entity2 road users pay 1 per cent of gdp on motor insurance			0
in the last five years , @entity2 suffered serious injury costs of £ 1.9 billion on motorways , £ 8.4 billion on primary a-roads and £ 5.9billion on non-primary a-roads			1
motorways account for 36 per cent of travel on the network analysed , 18 per cent on duals and 32 per cent on singles			0
motorcyclists make up just 1 per cent of traffic but 21 per cent of fatal and serious crashes on @entity2 ’s motorways and a-roads			1

new map rates the risk level of @entity2 *'s* *busiest* roads by colour
it was *compiled* by the @entity54 and @entity188
*statistics* also show that single carriageway a-roads are the most dangerous to drive on
the *winding* @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity297 , was rated the most dangerous in the country
it saw 44 fatal or serious crashes in just four years
