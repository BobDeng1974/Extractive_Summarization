by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 15:15 est , 4 january 2013 two police officers are being investigated over videos which show them allegedly knocking mobiles out of the hands of members of the public who were trying to film them over separate incidents			1
one case in @entity10 shows a man 's mobile knocked to the ground and apparently smashed by an officer			1
another video , filmed during an arrest in @entity17 , shows an officer marching towards the cameraman and smacking the mobile out of the way			1
the man involved claimed he was arrested immediately afterwards			1
during the 9 minute - long exchange , viewed by more than 1,300 users , the officer repeatedly tells the group : ' if you annoy somebody then it is a breach of the peace '			1
the individuals maintained annoying someone is n't illegal but the officer replied : ' if it causes an annoyance then it is an offence '			2
after about two minutes the officer says the group ' caused alarm '			1
the policeman also stated it is illegal to film people in public at which point one of the group started their own recording			2
the constable then lashes out knocking the phone out his hand where it can be heard smashing on the ground			1
the group can be heard asking ' if it 's illegal , what about the paparazzi ? ' and questioning why photographers can take photos and films in public , but the officer does not answer			1
the man , named by others in the video as ' @entity67 ' , said : ' why have you done that ? that 's criminal damage - you broke my phone			1
' the police officer approached the group of men , who asked why the paparazzi are allowed to take pictures but they are not no apology is offered to ' @entity67 ' and the officer only reveals his number as @entity82 and that he was based at the @entity84 station in @entity10			1
a @entity86 spokesman said : ' we intend to look in further detail at the circumstances behind this incident in order to determine whether any action is required			2
' they were also unable to confirm if the uploader of the video was arrested			0
the second video uploaded in september that has 1,045 views shows three @entity99 and @entity100 officers arresting a man in the street			2
two male officers were filmed holding the suspect while a female officer hit his legs with a baton and shouted : ' @entity108 '			1
the policemen then stumble as they struggle to subdue the individual			0
the cameraman walks closer to the chaotic arrest as the officers finally pin the man to the ground when another officer appears from the side of the screen and grabs the camera			1
the video appears to show three @entity99 and @entity100 officers arresting a man in the street this video clip shows an officer marching towards the cameraman and smacking the mobile out of the way - the cameraman claimed he was arrested afterwards the uploader of the footage , known only by his @entity132 username as ' p59er ' , claimed he was detained for filming the incident			1
