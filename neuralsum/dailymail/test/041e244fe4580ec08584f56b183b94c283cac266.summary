in the heart of @entity1 , a supervolcano releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day			1
but the magma chamber lying directly beneath its surface is not considered large enough to produce such levels , so researchers have been searching for an alternative source for years			1
now , by tracking seismic waves , a team of geophysicists has discovered an enormous secondary chamber deeper underground that 's so large its partly - molten rock could fill the @entity16 11 times over			1
a magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground the @entity1 supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world			1
@entity30 is used to describe magma or igneous rock rich in silica			2
it is situated in @entity1 - which spans the midwestern @entity36 states of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 - and last erupted 640,000 years ago			2

it is situated in @entity1 - which spans the midwestern @entity36 states of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 - and last erupted 640,000 years ago			2
although lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago , the researchers said			0
experts say there is a one in 700,000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site			0
previous research found a relatively small magma chamber , known as the upper - crustal magma reservoir , directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles ( 10,420 cubic km )			1
to discover the latest chamber , @entity58 from the @entity59 and colleagues tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes			0
the researchers said the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock			2
the remaining 2 per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption			1
it sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km )			1

to discover the latest chamber , @entity58 from the @entity59 and his colleagues tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes			0
these readings combined data from the @entity89 , which collected shallow readings from nearby quakes in @entity92 , @entity38 , the @entity93 and @entity1 , and from the @entity95 array , which revealed deeper readings from temblors from more further afield			2
each of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano			0
the movement and structure of these waves could then be used to map the earth beneath			0
the researchers said in their paper : ' the @entity1 magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust ' , published in the journal @entity111 , that the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock			1
the remaining two per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption , they added			2
it sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km )			1
to put this into perspective , the @entity16 in @entity120 has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles ( 4,168 cubic km ) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber would fill it two - and - a - half times , and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times			1

the latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km ) ( illustrated ) to discover the large chamber ( shown in yellow ) , the @entity59 tracked seismic waves from 5,000 earthquakes			1
each of these quakes created waves that ' echoed ' around the supervolcano			0
the smaller magma chamber is shown in red beneath the supervolcano 's caldera researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three @entity1 eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago			1
if @entity1 did erupt , estimates from a @entity155 report said its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly			0
a 10 - foot ( 3 metre ) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles ( 1,610km ) , leaving two - thirds of the @entity36 uninhabitable			0
this spread of volcanic ash , rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe			0
not only do the findings reveal what is causing the high levels of carbon dioxide , researchers can use it to learn more about how the supervolcano connects to the hot - spot plume in @entity176 's mantle			2
it could also provide clues about the structure of other supervolcanoes			0
' an understanding of its properties is key to enhancing our knowledge of volcanic mechanisms and corresponding risk , ' said the researchers			0
' this lower - crustal magma body has a volume 4.5 times larger than the upper - crustal magma reservoir [ and ] these estimates are critical to understanding the evolution of basaltic - rhyolitic volcanism and explaining the magnitude of @entity197 discharge			2
' the presence of magma reservoirs underlying upper crust magma chambers has been inferred at other locations , but not detected			0
the paper added that the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three @entity1 eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago			1

' the magma chamber and reservoir are not getting any bigger than they have been , it 's just that we can see them better now using new techniques , ' added co-author @entity230 , a post-doctoral researcher at the @entity59			1

researchers used seismic readings to map what is beneath @entity1
partly - molten rock reservoir measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km )
it sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the national park 's supervolcano
@entity258 is four times bigger than the magma chamber above it - but study said it is not posing any *additional* threat than it was before
