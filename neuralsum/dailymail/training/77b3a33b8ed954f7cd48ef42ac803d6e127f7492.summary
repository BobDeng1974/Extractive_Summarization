’ he also revealed that his commuting arrangement with mrs @entity3 ‘ stopped when she became chief executive of @entity53 ’ in 2009			2
both mrs @entity3 and her husband , the racehorse owner @entity55 , were charged with four others , on tuesday with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over the @entity61 investigation into phone hacking			2
mr @entity2 , one of the few mps to attend the @entity65 ’ wedding , told the inquiry that although he had decided his approach to the media was ‘ do n’t have favourites ’ , the @entity68 government had had ‘ incestuous ’ relations with some figures			1
and he came closer than other witnesses to saying @entity75 had influenced policy			2
‘ [ mr @entity75 ] reckoned his political influence would be greater if , as it were , his support was available in return for what he thought he could get out of it , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
‘ i do n’t mean a deal ... but he thought there was something in it			0
’ the meetings petered out after mrs @entity3 - who was yesterday charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to the phone - hacking scandal - was made @entity53 chief executive in 2009			2
the disclosure offers yet more evidence of mrs @entity3 ' extensive contacts with major political players			1

commuter route : @entity2 and @entity3 travelled to @entity24 together from @entity102 often , he told the @entity5 today mr @entity2 also admitted that @entity14 's links with journalists were ' sometimes incestuous ' in opposition '			1
he said @entity75 believed the power wielded by his newspapers benefited his wider commercial interests			2
mr @entity2 said the media mogul , 81 , liked his publications to keep their options open on which party to support because it could ' open more doors ' when it came to issues such as regulation and licences			1
power man : @entity75 , pictured with his wife @entity119 , liked his publications to keep their options open on which party to support because it could ' open more doors ' , mr @entity2 claimed he admitted that @entity68 's government had been too cosy with the press , blaming the fact that in opposition , links with journalists had become ' very , very close , sometimes incestuous '			1
he said : ' one of the reasons why the @entity131 was too close to people in the press was because we had not stopped that sort of contact but allowed it to continue to operate in that way in government			0
' mr @entity2 said the culture of spin developed within @entity14 because they were determined to cling on to power after the papers turned against them in the 1980s and the 1992 election			1
he said @entity147 became ' too close ' to certain journalists under @entity68			0
mr @entity2 added : ' what i saw was that generally some newspapers and some journalists with newspapers were being favoured by @entity147 and some ministers			1
' they had these little groups - it was very incestuous			0
' it suited no 10 and it suited those journalists at the time as they were getting stories that others in their newsrooms were n't			0
' i think it was a bad idea and i did n't like it			0
i tried to get on and do things in a different way			0
' favoured journalists : no 10 became ' too close ' to the media under @entity68 's government , @entity2 told the @entity5 today asked about mr @entity75 's impact on politicians , mr @entity2 insisted he had ' power '			1
while stressing he had only had a ' paragraph ' of conversation with the owner of the @entity18 and @entity175 , and no direct information , he said : ' he reckoned his political influence would be greater if , as it were , his support was available in return for what he thought he could get out of it			0
' i do n't mean a deal , because i have seen no evidence of a deal			0
but he thought there was something in it			0
' he went on : ' i think that the perception i have got is that mr @entity75 is enjoying the fact that he has been willing to play with political leaders in the way that the senior executives of the other papers have not			1
' he is very interested in power for its own sake , because you do not get to that position running a huge international media empire without being interested in power			0
' pressed on what mr @entity75 might have thought he would get from his influence over politicians , mr @entity2 suggested he wanted to ' consolidate his non-newspaper interests in this country '			1
mr @entity75 believed remaining available could ' open more doors in government when it came to things like media regulation , licences , regulation of football and so on '			2
the @entity14 mp rejected as ' disingenuous ' @entity214 's efforts to play down the importance of @entity53 's publications to the wider @entity218 empire			2
although they only constituted two per cent of the group 's financial interests , they were far more significant to the business in other ways , he said			0
asked whether mr @entity75 wielded ' power ' or ' influence ' , mr @entity2 replied : ' certainly , to those on the receiving end it felt like power			1
' earlier mr @entity2 said that he had always kept a ' respectful acquaintanceship ' with journalists as it was his instinct not to get to close .			1
