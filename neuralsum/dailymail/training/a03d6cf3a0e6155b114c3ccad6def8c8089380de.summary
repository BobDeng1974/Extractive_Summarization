by @entity0 published : 21:45 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 04:11 est , 24 october 2013 the charity that protects the @entity3 's historic and natural spaces has revealed it could allow fracking on its land			1
the head of the @entity7 says that the controversial method which drills for natural gas could be given the go - ahead on conserved land			1
dame @entity12 also practically ruled out allowing wind farms on the conservation charity 's property			1
in august , the charity said on its website that is has ' a presumption against fracking on @entity7 land ' because natural gas is a fossil gas she told @entity24 : ' i think it is unlikely we would ever promote or allow a wind farm on our land			1
' she also said the charity was concerned about proposals for offshore wind farms which could be visible from its land in @entity35 and the @entity36			1
the @entity7 's director general said that the charity is studying the environmental impact that fracking has on the earth			1
she told @entity24 : ' we all have yet to see what the surface environmental impact of fracking is and when we have seen it then we would reach a view about whether ( we would object to it ) adjacent to @entity7 land or on @entity7 land			1
' this is an about - turn for the charity , which in august said on its website that is has ' a presumption against fracking on @entity7 land ' because natural gas is a fossil gas			1
dame @entity12 also practically ruled out allowing wind farms on the conservation charity 's property it argued that the purpose of fracking - to mine for a finite resource which produces damaging greenhouse gases in the way it is burned - clashes with the charity 's approach to energy use			1
the @entity7 also argued that the mining process gives rise to potential environmental and landscape impacts			2
in august , the charity outlined its unfavourable view of fracking , saying : ' @entity79 gas is a finite resource that can only be mined and not harvested – it is not renewable			1
' its combustion produces greenhouse gases which we believe contribute to climate change			0
' climate change has a significant adverse impact on our core purpose of looking after special places , for ever for everyone			0
' a presumption against extracting and increasing the supply of natural gas from our own properties is the @entity12 said it is unlikely that the @entity7 would allow a wind farm on its land consistent with our approach to our own energy use and generation			1
' this is firstly to reduce our consumption of it at @entity7 directly managed properties , and then to generate as much renewable energy as we reasonably can in a way that respects the landscape and environment			2
' the @entity7 was founded in 1895 by @entity110 , including @entity111 , who were determined to protect the countryside and places of historical importance			2
since then it has fought to protect the countryside , and has committed itself to a programme revolving around reducing its environmental footprint			0
it has pledged to reduce use of fossil fuels by 50 per cent within the next 10 years			0
it aims to cut its carbon emissions from energy use for heat and electricity by 45 per cent – attempting to beat the government 's target of a 34 per cent reduction in co2 emissions by 2020			2
dame @entity12 's comments came after the prime minister announced a review of competition within the energy market yesterday and signalled he wanted to ' get to grips ' with green regulations which were driving up energy bills			1
@entity135 said the proposal had been discussed over the course of weeks with @entity139 ministers and would be set out in detail in chancellor @entity142 's @entity141 on december 4			2
mr @entity143 insisted last night he had raised the ideas with his coalition partners and he was still committed to the environment			0
he said : ' yes we should also look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes , tariffs , charges that have been put in place			0
' they are responsible for around £ 112 of someone 's bill today and if we are serious about getting energy prices down and helping families it 's no good having some phoney freeze policy , as @entity162 do , which is something of a con , what you need is to actually look at what is causing bills to go up			2
' so that is what we are doing , it is something we have discussed in the coalition over the last few weeks			0
' officials announced that the annual review of competition in the energy sector will be conducted by regulator @entity177 , the @entity178 and the new @entity179			0
details will be set out by energy secretary @entity181 next week in his annual statement to the @entity183			0
the first review is expected to begin within weeks and report next year , and will look at issues ranging from prices and profit levels to barriers to new entrants in the market , as well as how companies engage with customers , the prime minister 's official spokesman said			0
but the move , which came just 24 hours after former prime minster sir @entity196 called for the government to hit energy firms with a windfall tax , was branded a ' panicky u-turn ' by the @entity139			0
they claimed the @entity203 side of the coalition had not brought forward any ' properly worked - up policies ' and accused the prime minister of ' making policy up on the hoof '			0
labour leader @entity209 will claim today that the pm is letting the ' @entity211 ' energy suppliers off the hook by not forcing them to freeze bills while the energy market is reset .			0

dame @entity12 says that the controversial method which drills for natural gas could be given the go - ahead depending upon the *evidence*
