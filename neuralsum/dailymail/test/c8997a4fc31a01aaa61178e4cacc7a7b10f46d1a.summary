@entity1 striker @entity0 kept their fading promotion hopes alive as his 31st goal of the season salvaged a 1 - 1 @entity6 draw against play - off rivals @entity7 at @entity8			1
@entity0 , who scored 19 goals on loan at @entity11 before joining @entity1 from @entity12 in january for Â£ 2million , pounced after 50 minutes to cancel out a 21st - minute own goal from @entity14			1
it was a vital strike from @entity16 as the @entity18 side were heading for a third successive defeat which would have all but ended their play - off hopes			1
@entity1 striker @entity0 volleys home an equaliser for the home side at @entity8 to keep them in the @entity6 play - off hunt @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity14 , @entity29 ; van @entity30 ( @entity32 64 ) , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity16 subs not used : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 scorer : @entity45 50 booked : dicko @entity7 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 66 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 74 ) ; @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 83 ) subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 scorer : @entity65 21 booked : @entity52 , @entity54 referee : @entity67 while @entity1 are just about still alive in the promotion race , @entity7 remain well placed for a top - six finish despite failing to hold on to the advantage they were presented by @entity14			1
@entity7 boss @entity72 , who was in charge at @entity1 for almost six years before being sacked in february 2012 , has steered them to 75 points and knows that winning their final two games of the season would secure a place in the play - offs			1
@entity8 manager @entity81 had wanted a frenetic start and he got that through quick striker @entity36			2
@entity36 had been left out of the starting line - up for the previous game at @entity86 and he looked like he had a point to prove following his recall , with pace which tormented @entity48 and his central defensive partner , @entity1 old boy @entity49			2
however , the hosts failed to make the most of his efforts and @entity7 were able to ride out the storm before taking the lead			2
@entity96 international @entity48 rose above the @entity1 defence and met a corner from @entity55 that was glanced goalwards and deflected into his own net by the luckless @entity14			1
wolves took time to come to terms with falling behind and when they finally did force an attack of note @entity36 saw his 33rd - minute shot blocked by @entity49			0
that sparked @entity81 's team back into life and they were unlucky not to draw level six minutes before half - time when @entity7 failed to clear their lines			2
the ball fell invitingly on the edge of the area to @entity33 , whose volley looked set to sneak just inside the post before @entity46 tipped it away for a corner			0
wolves took that freshly found momentum into the start of the second half and , after @entity36 flashed a header from a @entity35 cross just wide , @entity0 continued his prolific spell in front of goal			0
@entity126 's low drive was deflected into the path of @entity0 , who reacted brilliantly to force the ball home at the far post			0
with parity restored , @entity1 carried more of a threat and @entity49 found himself working overtime to try and keep the dangerous @entity36 in check			0
@entity7 were penned in their own half for long spells and when they did break out , @entity58 failed to test goalkeeper @entity26 as he dragged his 73rd - minute shot wide			0
@entity48 's header ( right ) rebounds off @entity1 defender @entity14 for an own goal to hand @entity7 the lead on saturday however , the hosts were by far the dominant force and @entity36 looked set to make that pressure pay in the 76th minute - only to again be denied from six yards by another well timed block from the hard working @entity49			1
failing to make the most of that pressure almost came back to haunt @entity1 four minutes from time when substitute @entity59 picked up the ball on the left flank and surged towards goal , only to see his shot curl agonisingly wide of @entity26 's far post			0
and the hosts ' frustration was capped in stoppage time when @entity36 just failed to connect with a bouncing cross-shot from @entity34			0
@entity48 celebrates with @entity7 team - mates after the @entity7 took a first - half lead in the @entity6 clash with @entity1			1

@entity14 headed into his own net from a set - piece to gift @entity7 an early lead at @entity8
wolves equalised on 50 minutes with striker @entity0 volleying in from close range
the result keeps @entity7 sixth in the @entity6 , just three points ahead of play - off chasing @entity1
