published : 17:48 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 04:25 est , 13 september 2012 with his thrilling five - set @entity2 victory , @entity0 is assured of a place in the tennis history books			1
his epic triumph also brings the promise of more immediate material rewards , however			0
experts yesterday predicted that by ending the nation 's 76 - year wait for a @entity12 men 's singles champion , @entity0 's career earnings could now top £ 100million – making him one of @entity16 's richest sports superstars			1
but that will be dwarfed by the riches set to flood into the 25 - year - old 's bank account			0
coupled with his @entity47 - winning defeat of @entity48 last month , the @entity2 result will see major international sponsors clamour for a piece of ' @entity51 '			0
@entity0 already has a £ 15million five - year deal with @entity53 , as well as lucrative contracts with @entity55 , @entity57 racquets and @entity58			2
according to the @entity60 , his £ 24million fortune makes him the @entity16 's 42nd - richest sportsman			1
but by joining tennis 's elite @entity12 club and emulating the achievement of @entity66 – the last @entity67 to see such success , with eight slams between 1933 and 1936 – the young @entity62 is likely to have huge brands such as @entity71 and @entity72 lining up to be associated with him			1
@entity0 looks on next to the @entity75 open championship trophy during an interview on @entity77 in the money : despite being made to sweat for almost five hours to win the title , new @entity2 champion @entity0 looked fine as he reflected on a win that could earn him up to £ 100million champion : @entity2 tennis men 's singles champion @entity0 posing with the trophy @entity0 celebrates in @entity30 with the trophy in front of the press following his win @entity0 walks with his girlfriend @entity24 after a photo session in @entity21 's @entity30 @entity90 , of sports marketing agency @entity91 , said : ' @entity0 could realistically triple his off - court earnings from sponsorship , advertising and endorsements to reach around £ 20million in the next 12 months			1
' tennis and golf are two of the few genuinely global sports that reach every country and as one of the top four players in tennis he has a huge global profile			0
' the last obstacle to him really moving into the very top league of sports earners was winning a @entity12 tournament			2
winning team : @entity0 and his girlfriend @entity24 pose with the @entity2 championship trophy triumphant : @entity0 , wearing a £ 2,580 watch provided by his sponsors , holds the @entity2 trophy aloft after defeating @entity116 's @entity32 in the men 's singles final match in @entity21 ' once you 're a @entity12 winner you 're in a unique group , and it 's that uniqueness that becomes highly marketable			1
he will become one of the few athletes who is recognised in every part of the world			0
' one reward @entity0 is not apparently angling for , however , is a knighthood			2
he said : ' a lot of my friends have been messaging me about it			0
i think it should maybe take more than just one or two good tournaments to deserve something like that , but i think people will be saying that because it 's been such a long time since it happened in tennis			0
it would probably be a bit rash			0
' praise from the pm : @entity142 hailed @entity0 's triumph as a ' truly great victory ' licence to thrill : comedian @entity147 joked on @entity148 that support from @entity150 actor sir @entity149 had helped @entity0 win the title cheer : @entity154 actor @entity153 , who was among the crowd watching the match , tweeted his congratulations to @entity0 after the match @entity0 's win , capping a golden summer of @entity16 sport , came in a stunning performance witnessed by a crowd featuring a strong contingent of @entity16 celebrities			1

@entity75 actors @entity153 and @entity174 star @entity174 were also there			0
as the plaudits rolled in , @entity142 was quick to hail the triumph a ' truly great victory '			1
@entity0 's manager @entity178 was among the delighted spectators , seeing one of his sporting clients make history			2
but the man behind the 19 management group that also looks after @entity185 and @entity186 must now try to persuade his charge to re-sign when his contract expires in december – just at the time when @entity0 's commercial potential has rocketed			2
@entity24 looks to the big screen with her hands clasped together as a point is challenged friends in high places : actor @entity196 tweeted pictures of himself meeting @entity0 and holding the @entity2 trophy actor @entity149 awaits the start of the @entity2 men 's final @entity203 star @entity153 , left , smiles as he watches the drama unfold on court			1
