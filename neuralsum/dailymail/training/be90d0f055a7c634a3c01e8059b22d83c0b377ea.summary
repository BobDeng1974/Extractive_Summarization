@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3			0
now there are just four of the @entity6 minnows who have surpassed @entity8 by making it to the fifth round in recent seasons			1
not since 2006 – in a @entity13 era – have the @entity11 progressed beyond the fourth round			1
you can add @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 to a list of lower - league teams who have outshone @entity13 ’s @entity8 in a competition they have won six times			1
indeed , their tradition and history is best illustrated by the @entity6 and the team of the 1950s – led by @entity30 – who lifted the famous trophy three times in five years			1
@entity8 were knocked out of the @entity6 third round away at @entity34 on saturday @entity34 striker @entity35 ( centre ) headed home the only goal of the match to dump out the @entity11 @entity8 caretaker boss @entity40 has been heavily criticised for his team selection at @entity34 @entity8 lost 1 - 0 at @entity42 the last time they progressed beyond the fifth round of the @entity6 in 2006 today , however , they are the only football club in the land who have gone on record in deprioritising the 144 - year - old competition			1
such policy has certainly been played out on the pitch			0
in fact , no top - flight club better – or worse - demonstrates the demise of the @entity6 and its relevance in a climate where the @entity58 cash cow is the only competition worth milking			1
since gaining promotion back to the top division in 2010 , @entity8 have won just one @entity6 match			1
they have been eliminated by @entity2 , @entity64 ( twice ) , @entity65 and @entity34			2
twice they have made seven changes for a third - round defeat and twice they have made five			2
on saturday , during the sorry 1 - 0 surrender at @entity34 in which star players @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 were rested by caretaker boss @entity40 , supporters made their feelings known			1
‘ we ’re s * * * t and we ’re sick of it ’ was the terrace put - down , followed by disgust when they waved their own players away as they attempted to applaud a 4,300 - strong following			0
the @entity85 have had enough			0
their team are tenth in the table , 10 points clear of the relegation zone , seemingly needing just 13 more to hit 40 and renew their @entity58 status and , more importantly from a boardroom perspective , bolster the owner ’s bank balance for one more season at least			0
why , then , did they so brazenly disrespect this season ’s @entity6 ? club legend @entity96 said he was ‘ annoyed , angry and surprised ’ when @entity97 named a weakened side in last year ’s third round , while @entity100 , who played 337 times for @entity8 and was at @entity34 on saturday , is another former favourite who can not understand the approach			1
travelling @entity8 supporters chanted their disgust at their team 's performance during the match one @entity8 fan in particular was disgusted by the @entity11 ' dismissive treatment of the @entity6 @entity8 players were waved away by their fans as they tried to applaud them at full - time ‘ it ’s baffling why they do not value the cups when they ’re in the position they are in the league , ’ he told @entity114			1
‘ i was at the game on saturday and so were more than 4,000 @entity8 fans and i could not believe the team when i heard it - it ’s taking a lend of fans when they ’ve paid good money to be there			2
‘ they were n’t happy and they had every right not to be			0
it was like a practice match and , to be honest , neither team wanted to win it			0
‘ @entity34 would have been just as happy to get beat you feel			2
but they ’re fighting to stay in the league and you can understand their changes to a degree – their priority is survival			0
‘ but @entity8 only need another three or four wins and they ’ll be fine			2
so now you ’re left with a scenario where the season is pretty much over in january			0
‘ what are they playing for ? to finish as high as possible in the league ? well you ’d even doubt that because the @entity144 is just as much as a distraction to them as the @entity6			2
’ @entity8 legend @entity96 was annoyed about the club 's approach to saturday 's game @entity100 himself only made it to the fifth round on three occasions during 10 years on @entity154			1
but the former @entity156 international says there was never a question of certain competitions taking precedence			0
‘ listen , our record in the @entity6 was n’t great , but it was n’t for the want of trying , we just were n’t good enough , ’ he said			0
‘ we named our strongest side in every match and i appreciate things have changed in that respect , but clubs like @entity8 and those around them in the @entity58 should be having a right good go at the cups			0
‘ they are n’t going to get in the top four , they are n’t going down and they ’ve got supporters who work hard all week and follow them all over the country in their thousands			0
‘ @entity8 are n’t the only ones guilty of this but it ’s killing the cup and you end up with matches like saturday which just feel like an inconvenience for both teams			2
’ there , in one word , @entity100 captures the sad slide of the @entity6 – has it really become an inconvenience ? playmaker @entity188 ( left ) was unable to inspire the @entity11 to the fourth round of the @entity6			1

@entity8 lost 1 - 0 at @entity34 in the third round of the @entity6 on saturday
the @entity11 have *n't* progressed beyond the fourth round since owner @entity194 bought the club
@entity8 have won the @entity6 six times in their history
