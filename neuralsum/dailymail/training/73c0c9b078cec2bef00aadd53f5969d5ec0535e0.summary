by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 11 october 2013 grieving families of fallen troops will receive compensation despite the government shutdown , president @entity5 assured as he signed the benefits guarantee into law today			1
relatives of soldiers lost in battle since closing of federal government on october 1st were outraged when @entity12 suspended the roughly $ 100,000 payments			1
@entity5 signed the bill securing the payments into law after it won final passage in the @entity18 earlier on thursday			1
@entity12 promises : president @entity5 signed a bill securing payments to families of fallen troops during the government shutdown among those relieved are the families of sergeant @entity25 , 25 , private first class @entity26 , 24 , lieutenant			1
@entity28 , 25 , and special agent @entity29 , 24 , who all died from an explosive device this past weekend , and the families of 25 other active - duty service members who lost their lives during the 11 days of the shutdown			0
initially the familes were told that there would be no ' death benefits ' payments , typically $ 100,000 paid out within three days of a service member 's death			1
while the federal government was on ice			0
the new bill reinstates benefits for surviving family members , including funeral and burial expenses , and death gratuity payments			2
however @entity5 's chief spokesman , @entity49 , had said the measure was unnecessary because a military charity had stepped in to continue the payments			2
@entity26 's body was brought back to the @entity56 after being killed in @entity57 on october 6 , when his family was told the benefits payout was at risk respect : the @entity12 has now agreed to pay the charity back after the shutdown is lifted and secretary of defense @entity64 was at @entity66 when @entity26 's body arrived the @entity12 had said the lapse in funding meant it had no authority to continue the payments , but that explanation that did not sit well with members of @entity74 in either party			1
the @entity12 said a law allowing members of the military to be paid during the shutdown did not cover the death benefit payments			1
@entity74 passed and @entity5 signed that measure into law before the shutdown began , and lawmakers insisted the benefits should n't have been affected			1
the @entity86 voted unanimously on wednesday for a resolution that would ensure that death benefits to families of fallen troops will be disbursed during the government shutdown			1
@entity92 stepped the @entity86 , which defense secretary @entity64 said wednesday would cover the costs during the shutdown			0
@entity95 said the @entity12 would reimburse the foundation after the shutdown ends			2
the government could not actively solicit funds from private organizations but could accept an offer			0
the administration said thursday night that the @entity12 's agreement with @entity86 would remain intact to make sure the benefits are delivered without further interruption until officials can get the program up and running again			2
victims twice over : the relatives of sgt @entity25 ( left ) and 1st lt @entity28 ( right ) were initially denied survivors benefits from the military because of the federal shutdown the bill is the second ‘ piecemeal ’ measure @entity5 has signed to hold the military harmless during the shutdown			1
at the same time , the @entity117 has threatened vetoes of other ‘ piecemeal ’ measures passed by the @entity120 - controlled @entity86 to continue funding for certain government operations			0
the @entity117 has said the @entity86 should reopen the entire government and not choose to fund some agencies and programs over others			0
@entity5 also supports @entity86 - passed legislation to provide back pay for thousands of federal workers forced off the job because of the shutdown			2
across the @entity135 , republicans on a @entity134 panel excoriated @entity12 comptroller @entity136 , accusing him of playing politics with his interpretation of the original law			0
they said the law was designed to pay the death benefits as well as keep all @entity12 civilians on the job — not to select the most essential			2
‘ you went out of your way to make this as ugly as possible , to inflict as much pain as possible on this department , ’ said rep. @entity144 , @entity145 , who introduced the first bill days before the shutdown in an attempt to exempt the military			0
@entity136 responded that the law was poorly written and there never should have been a shutdown in the first place			0
‘ i resent your remarks , ’ the budget chief said			0
‘ i acted on the advice of attorneys and our best reading of a loosely worded law			0
