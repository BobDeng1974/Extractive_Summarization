by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 21 november 2013 @entity2 : 07:24 est , 21 november 2013 a city council has created a guide to teach migrants how to behave in an apparent bid to ease tensions in the community			1
the leaflet , drafted by @entity10 , warns new arrivals , including @entity12 , against a slew of offensive habits - including urinating , defecating , spitting or having sex in the street - that upset locals			1
it also contains instructions on claiming benefits and other taxpayer - funded services like healthcare and accessing translators			2
there is advice on ' being a good neighbour ' , urging migrants not to dump litter in a neighbour 's garden or allow their children to play there , hang washing on their fence and not to block drains with soiled nappies			1
@entity10 produced a guide on anti-social behaviour , which follows the influx of migrants , including @entity12			1
pictured are @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 in the @entity45 area of the city			2
they were pictured for an earlier , unrelated , article bizarrely , it also instructs them on how @entity53 people usually clean their rugs and carpets and recommends buying or hiring a vaccum cleaner and a shampooing machine			0
the city has been riven by racial tension , especially in the @entity45 area , and fear of civil unrest is growing			2
to make matters worse there are the first signs of vigilante action against the new @entity12 arrivals			1
some residents with strong views about their new neighbours have begun patrolling the streets at night to ‘ gather evidence ’ of anti-social behaviour and possible criminal activity			1
in addition , the local @entity76 community association is running ‘ official ’ warden patrols between 8pm and 10pm every weekday with the intention of ‘ educating ’ the @entity12 population about ‘ how to behave in @entity82 ’			1
outspoken : local @entity76 @entity83 has expressed the thoughts of many on their new @entity12 neighbours tempers flaring : the dispute becomes more heated as mr @entity42 is confronted by @entity89 , 63 @entity10 defended their work with migrants and said the guide will not be released			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity94 has a proud tradition of welcoming people from a large number of backgrounds and has done for many , many years			2
as a council we do n’t take a view who should be in this country or not			0
' we give advice to all people visiting or living in the city			2
this includes more than 55,000 students who come here			0
' warning : mr @entity109 , the former labour home secretary , has warned the increased @entity12 presence could spark riots ' we have not released this document at all and it is not something which we ever agreed as a council to be used as a leaflet or otherwise			1
' the leaflet , which was leaked to the @entity118 , also contains advice on raising children , saying : ' babies and young children should never be left at home alone			0
' @entity125 , @entity124 blasted the unpublished guide as a waste of public money			0
he said : ' spending taxpayers ’ money on this frankly ludicrous guide is not only a waste of money , but there is also a danger it would exacerbate problems caused when communities do not integrate			0
' councils should not be encouraging the use of interpreters for those wishing to access public services			0
' it ’s vital that those coming to @entity53 are able to speak the language and interact with existing communities before they arrive , rather than taxpayers footing an extra burden for this kind of nonsense guide			0
' @entity153 , vice chair of @entity154 , a non-governmental body that monitors immigration , said : ' it 's pitiful state of affairs that we have had to resort to this			0
' if they think they can stop the problem by producing leaflets i 've got news for them : it wo n't			1
' i can see why they feel the need to do something about it and you ca n't blame them for trying			2
' just weeks ago former home secretary @entity109 warned @entity53 cities could be hit by rioting because of an influx of @entity12 migrants			1
mr @entity109 called on @entity12 migrants from @entity179 to ‘ change their culture ’ because their dumping of rubbish and refusal to send their children to school had caused ‘ understandable tensions ’ with residents in @entity94			1
@entity53 is home to more than 200,000 @entity12 migrants , most of them from @entity190			1
the former home secretary said ‘ frictions ’ with local people could lead to race riots			0
‘ if everything exploded , if things went wrong , the community would obviously be devastated , ’ mr @entity109 said			0
mr @entity109 claimed that the cultural gulf between the community in @entity94 and the @entity12 was far greater than that between white @entity53 and @entity76 immigrants			2
unusual : slightly more odd is the guide 's advice for cleaning carpets he said : ‘ the @entity12 youngsters have come from a background even more different culturally , because they were living in the edge of woods , not going to school , not used to the norms of everyday life			2
we ’ve got to change that			0
’ mr @entity109 said locals were entitled to ‘ grumble ’ about the large influx of migrants from @entity12 communities , but they should not ‘ stir up hate ’			1
‘ i would n’t want other people to put up with things i would n’t put up with myself , ’ he said			0
‘ this is nothing to do with criticising people about being racist			0
' by all means grumble , but do n’t stir up hate			0

city chiefs produced leaflets on behaviour for migrants , but wo n't release it
they are urged not to spit , urinate or defecate in the street
migrants also told not to dump rubbish in neighbours ' gardens
the city has seen tensions rise over large influx of @entity12
