an @entity1 poll put @entity3 's pro-independence campaigners on 54 % last night ’s polls only serve to underline how the independence vote remains on a knife - edge			1
an @entity1 poll put @entity3 ’s pro-independence campaigners on 54 per cent with the no camp trailing way behind on 46			1
two other polls gave the no camp a clear lead and yet another suggested that the fight was heading for a dead heat			1
yesterday ’s @entity1 poll – giving the @entity17 vote one of its highest - ratings yet – sent a chill through the keep - the - @entity21 camp and cooled hopes that the no campaign was finally pulling ahead			2
however , polling expert @entity24 immediately gave the @entity1 verdict a ‘ substantial health warning ’ , saying it was based on a smaller - than - usual sample of 705 people and was potentially more ‘ vulnerable ’ to error			1
on a day of rapidly - changing fortunes , the @entity32 campaign was celebrating after a @entity35 survey produced 54 - 46 result in favour of no voters			0
later , a second poll called it for the @entity17 camp , with an eight - point lead			0
but then an @entity45 / @entity44 survey had the @entity47 camp six points ahead on 53 per cent compared to the @entity17 lobby ’s 47			0
surprisingly , it claimed that last week ’s surprise offer of a raft of new devo - max powers – unveiled after a @entity55 poll last weekend put @entity17 in the lead – seemed to have had little impact on how people intended to vote			0
but before the no camp could relax , the fourth and final poll published yesterday put the rival camps at almost neck and neck			0
the @entity66 survey , for the @entity64 , had @entity17 on 49.4 per cent and @entity67 on 50.6 per cent			0
last night , polling experts insisted the final result in four days ’ time was still too close to call			2
as @entity72 pleads with pro-union campaigners to spread the word , polling experts insist the final result in four days ’ time is still too close to call			1

@entity1 poll put pro-independence campaigners on 54 % , with no camp on 46 %
