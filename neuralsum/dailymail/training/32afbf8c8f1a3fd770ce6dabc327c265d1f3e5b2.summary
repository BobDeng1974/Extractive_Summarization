amazing images of lighting in the eye of a cyclone have been captured by an astronaut on the @entity5 the incredible views of tropical cyclone @entity7 were spotted in the @entity9 near the island of @entity11 , when the @entity5 was east of @entity12			1
the calm ‘ eye ’ of the storm can be seen illuminated by lightning and surrounded by swirling clouds as it made its way across the ocean			2
an @entity21 astronaut on the @entity5 captured images of a cyclone on @entity24			1
tropical cyclone @entity7 was spotted in the @entity9 by @entity26 's @entity25 while the @entity5 was east of @entity12			1
the images show flashes of lighting illuminating the eye of the storm ( shown ) the images were taken by @entity21 @entity26 astronaut @entity25 aboard the @entity5 earlier this month			1
tropical cyclones are low pressure systems that develop in the tropics in the @entity36			0
they produce gale force winds of about 39mph ( 63km/h ) on average and rotate in a clockwise direction			0
if the winds reach 73mph ( 118km/h ) , the system is called a severe tropical cyclone			2
the strongest winds are always near the eye , but damaging winds can extend hundreds of kilometres from the cyclone ’s centre			0
cyclones form in warm oceans when sea - surface temperature exceeds @entity53 and there are favourable wind conditions			0
they can persist for several days but lose their energy when they move over land or colder oceans , or are disrupted by another wind system			0
they show the swirling motion of the storm around the central blue eye			0
according to @entity68 , the wall of the eye is being illuminated by a flash of lightning in the centre of the storm - which also lights up nearby clouds			0
the low - light settings of the camera used to take the image accentuate the contrast			0
‘ it looks like the storm is powering up some sort of weapon ! ’ said @entity77 at @entity78			0
one image also shows a thin green line over the horizon known as airglow , which occurs when oxygen atoms are energised by the sun. the camera again accentuates this effect , which is an atmospheric phenomenon frequently seen by astronauts			2
stars appear above the airglow layer , and the solar panels of a docked @entity95 spacecraft jut into the image			0
@entity97 formed in the southwestern @entity9 on 11 january this year			2
by the time @entity25 's photos were taken , on the following day , @entity7 had achieved tropical cyclone strength , with sustained maximum winds over 115 miles ( 185km ) per hour			1
the cyclone would reach category 4 strength before becoming a weak extra-tropical system on 19 january			2
@entity97 formed in the southwestern @entity9 on 11 january this year , just off the coast of @entity12 ( shown )			1
the cyclone reached category 4 strength ( shown in orange and red ) before becoming a weak extra-tropical system on 19 january ( right in blue ) another image by @entity25 ( shown ) also revealed a green line of ' airglow ' above @entity24 near the cyclone , with part of a @entity95 spacecraft also in the image			1
@entity117 occurs when oxygen atoms are energised by the sun. @entity7 formed on 11 january and became a tropical cyclone before weakening by 19 january @entity26 astronaut @entity25 , pictured , was born in @entity123 , @entity21 on 26 april 1977			1
she was selected as an @entity26 astronaut in may 2009 and , on 23 november 2014 , she launched on her first mission to the @entity5 aboard a @entity127 spacecraft as part of @entity129 on 15 january at 6.15am @entity132 ( 1.15am est ) , @entity68 's @entity131 satellite captured this visible picture of tropical cyclone @entity135 east - northeast of the island of @entity11			1

an @entity21 astronaut on the @entity5 captured images of tropical cyclone @entity7 raging on @entity24
it was spotted in the @entity9 by @entity26 's @entity25 while the @entity5 was east of @entity12
the images show flashes of lightning illuminating the eye of the storm with another showing a green line of ' airglow '
@entity7 formed on 11 january and became a tropical cyclone before weakening by 19 january
