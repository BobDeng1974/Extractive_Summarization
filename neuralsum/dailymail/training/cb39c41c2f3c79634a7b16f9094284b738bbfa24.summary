@entity0 will turn down the chance to move @entity2 or @entity3 and stay at @entity4 , with @entity5 insisting that the £ 50m striker still has a part to play in the squad despite not even making the bench for saturday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity11			1
both @entity13 clubs have made inquiries about @entity15 but the striker is not keen on a move to @entity18 and @entity5 claims that the @entity19 , who has two years left on his contract , can not leave as he needs three strikers for the season			1
@entity5 said : ‘ i want three strikers in the team			1
sometimes i want to play with two and have one on the bench			1
at other times , someone will be suspended , another will be injured			0
benched : @entity0 ( centre ) , chatting to kit man @entity31 and team - mate @entity32 , has not enjoyed a second of @entity35 action this season man of the monent : @entity38 celebrates scoring his second goal for @entity4 ' someone will be needed as a third striker			1
i ca n’t do a season without a third striker			2
our squad was made carefully the top structure of my club to give me what i want			2
‘ i believe he will remain			0
he will be very useful for us			0
he is a fantastic guy , fantastic professional , so no problem			0
' i told the players yesterday that at this moment we are playing one match a week and they feel : “ oh , i ’m playing , i ’m not playing			2
i ’m first option , i ’m second , i ’m third			0
” staying or going : @entity0 has been out of favour so far this season but could stay and fight for his place options : @entity38 and @entity60 are @entity5 's preferred frontmen ' but this is over next week			1
after that we have @entity65 and @entity66 and three matches a week			0
everything is much easier for them then because all of them will be playing			0
‘ the reason he was n’t on the bench today was that i decided to have a balanced bench with one defender , one full back , one defence midfielder , one attacking midfielder on winger and one striker			2
sometimes i can have two strikers on the bench sometimes i ca n’t			0
’ great start : @entity38 beats @entity11 keeper @entity84 to give @entity4 the lead deposed : @entity0 comes on for @entity38 during a pre-season friendly against @entity87 - but @entity38 is now the main man at @entity88 @entity60 was chosen ahead of @entity0 on the bench , with @entity38 starting and @entity60 received a rapturous reception on 79 minutes when he came on for first competitive game at @entity88 since leaving in 2012			1
@entity38 has scored two goals in two games since signing for £ 32m from @entity94 in the summer and @entity60 returned to the club on a free transfer .			1

@entity13 clubs @entity2 and @entity3 *reportedly* want to sign @entity0
@entity101 striker not even on the bench for @entity4 's 2 - 0 win over @entity11
but @entity0 says he 's not *interested* in moving to @entity18
@entity106 boss @entity5 claims he wants to keep the striker for the *strength* of the squad
the striker is yet to play in the @entity35 this season
@entity0 is playing second fiddle to new signings @entity38 and @entity60
