these riders ca n’t believe their eyes ! they may look rather strange but they are actually testing a new way of experiencing a roller coaster			0
with theme parks battling to add evermore twists , turns and loop - the - loops to terrify thrill - seekers , researchers are also testing ways of adding an extra fear - factor			0
by wearing an @entity13 headset , the roller coaster rides present a virtual dimension to the rider and they can fly through space , ride on the backs of dragons and swoop through dangerous terrain			1
it may sound too good to be true but the people behind @entity22 have already started testing the technology ... and based on the comments of the ride testers , the experiment was a resounding success			1
the @entity27 is the very first synchronised virtual reality ride on real roller coasters and hundreds of test rides were carried out in @entity32 's @entity31			1
for the test , coaster cars are rigged with laptops and cameras , and the wheels fitted with special electronics , setting the scene for a ride testers will never forget			1
the testers strap themselves in , psyching themselves for the ride of their lives			1
one tester plays the video game whilst the other gets to experience the view ahead , which is enhanced and influenced both by the game and by the movements of his head			0
early stages of the test required an on board operator to synchronise the real and the @entity13 ride the roller coaster zooms off and almost immediately participants are screaming as the cold wind hits their skin			1
but the headset tester is looking around , instead of looking straight ahead like the other joyriders			0
at one point he looks up , as if he can see things that the others can not			0
and indeed he can , as he is aware of a completely different view to the rest of the riders			0
as the roller coasters swoops , swerves and dives across twisting corners , the headset user is treated to a different sights , sounds and movements			0
one test rider is on horseback , riding in a virtual world of tunnels , windmills , and ogres			1
as the roller coaster hugs the tracks , curving ever - higher , the tester 's virtual horse sprouts wings and evades a monster			2
the roller coasters ' 360 degree turns are also echoed on the headset and the rider and his horse follow suit			0
the scene changes to another user , who is playing a game in space			2
spaceman : through the headset , the tester is travelling through space ( inset ) , blasting away debris and fighting invaders this tester sees himself flying across the sky ( inset ) past giants and monsters , on a winged horse as the roller coaster moves , the rider ‘ fires ’ shots on his console , which , on his headset , translate as bullets from a space gun that decimate space debris , clearing a path for his spaceship			2
‘ man , that was cool			0
this is was amazing , awesome , sensational , ’ one tester says in @entity32			1
another tester said the ride was ‘ epic ’ and ‘ better than without headsets ’			2
‘ @entity134 , a brilliant idea , ’ an enthusiastic tester , who can barely hide her excitement , exclaims			0
the idea a synchronised virtual ride came from @entity141 , a @entity142 professor at the @entity143 , @entity32 .			1

the @entity145 lets users fly through space
hundreds of tests have been carried in @entity31 *rollercoasters*
the ride was created by @entity32 virtual design professor @entity141
