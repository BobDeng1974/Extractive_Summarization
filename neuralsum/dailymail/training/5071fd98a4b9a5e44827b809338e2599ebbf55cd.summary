by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 04:16 est , 31 may 2013 a school sandwich was thrown at @entity3 prime minister @entity2 today for the second time this month - and this time it hit her			1
the salami sandwich on white bread struck miss @entity2 on the arm when she visited a school in @entity10			1
but she laughed off the incident later , declaring : ' the child who threw it must have thought i was hungry			1
the contents of the sandwich thrown today has sparked widespread debate on social media , with some observers asking why the parents of the culprit - who has yet to be identified - had prepared such a non-nutritious sandwich			0
but others said more expense had gone into the making of the sandwich as salami would have cost more than a spread of vegemite			0
miss @entity2 's security team and photographers surrounded the missile as it lay splattered at the prime minister 's feet during her visit to @entity45			1
she was walking through the foyer , filled with excited schoolchildren who were calling her name and trying to shake her hand , when the sandwich was lobbed from the back of the group and , said witnesses , struck her on the arm			2
she did not react at the time but joked later with the remark about the child who threw it probably thinking she was hungry			0
the salami sandwich attack happened weeks after another flying sandwich narrowly missed @entity2 incident earlier this month : the missile - believed to contain @entity21 - did n't hit @entity62 leader @entity2 but it landed with a plop on the ground near her when she was mobbed by the students in @entity24 the sandwich was thrown by a student at @entity3 's prime minister as she was mobbed by abusive children at a school south of @entity71 the chief minister of the @entity73 , @entity72 , also made light of the incident , saying that ' schools are full of kids and kids occasionally do silly things			1
' she added : ' occasionally you 're going to get a rogue student			0
' from what i saw , and i was squashed in the crowd , it was a really excited student population eager to talk with the prime minister and she was very generous with her time			0
' while the school declined to comment pending an investigation , principal @entity90 gave one student a severe dressing down , although the matter was apparently unrelated to the sandwich throwing			0
miss @entity90 was heard telling the student : ' i 've already been humiliated by one child today - do n't let it happen with another			2
