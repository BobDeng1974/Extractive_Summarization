marinate the pork belly in the honey mix for as long as possible - two hours will do - then wrap in cling film and place in the fridge for better results			1
put all the vegetables in the bottom of the roasting tray , place the pork belly on top of the vegetables and add water until it almost touches the bottom of the meat			1
place in the oven at @entity107 for about 2 ½ hours			1

after 2 ½ hours , remove the lid and place the pork onto a tray and back into the oven			1
turn up the heat to 230c and cook for a further 30 minutes to get a lovely crispy crackling			2
