by @entity0 published : 05:54 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 06:13 est , 15 march 2013 young @entity2 soldiers who have had combat experience are more likely to commit violent crimes when they return home from the armed forces			1
of around 3,000 military men under the age of 30 , more than a fifth had a conviction for violent offences , compared with 6.7 per cent of their peers who are not in the army			1
there were strong links between combat experience with post-deployment alcohol misuse , traumatic stress and violence			1
@entity2 soldiers who have experienced combat are more likely to commit violent crime and suffer from alcohol misuse and post traumatic stress disorder ( file image ) men who had seen combat in @entity25 and @entity26 were 53 per cent more likely to commit a violent offence than comrades given non-combat roles			1
those with multiple experiences of combat had a 70 per cent to 80 per cent greater risk of committing acts of violence			1
in the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken , researchers were given access to police records on almost 14,000 randomly selected men and women who were active or former members of the armed forces , mostly the @entity41			1
participants provided information about their experiences before and after joining the military and underwent psychological tests			1
a search of the @entity48 was made for any convictions , cautions or warnings relating to the study population			2
overall , 17 per cent of the men had criminal records , and 11 per cent had committed violent offences			1
of the 2,728 aged 30 and younger , 20.6 per cent had a criminal record for violence			1
professor sir @entity58 said screening within the armed forces to identify at - risk individuals would not work ( file image ) the findings , released on the 10th anniversary of the @entity64 , are published in a special issue of @entity67 medical journal			2
study leader dr @entity68 , from @entity69 , said : ‘ there has been a lot of media coverage and public debate about violence committed by veterans of the conflicts in @entity25 and @entity26			2
‘ our study , which used official criminal records , found that violent offending was most common among young men from the lower ranks of the @entity41 and was strongly associated with a history of violent offending before joining the military			1
‘ serving in a combat role and traumatic experiences on deployment also increased the risk of violent behaviour			1
’ violent offences covered a broad range of acts , from verbal harassment to homicide			1
they did not include incidents of domestic violence			2
a strong association was seen between violent offending and high levels of self - reported aggression			1
professor sir @entity58 , co-director of the @entity103 at @entity69 , who co-authored the study , admitted that an aggressive streak can be useful in a soldier			2
‘ some people with aggressive dispositions make very good soldiers , that 's the nature of the game , ’ he told a press conference in @entity109			1
he added : ‘ my own view , and the view of many people in this area , is that you meet a lot of people in the armed forces who you 're glad are in the armed forces , and it 's doing them a lot of good			2
’ but he stressed that the vast majority of soldiers returning from tours of duty in combat zones never got into trouble			1
‘ not every single person who joins the armed forces is @entity135 or sir @entity136 , ’ said the professor			0
‘ we are suggesting there is a problem that needs to be looked at , but just as with post traumatic stress disorder this is not a common outcome in military populations			1
overall you must remember that of those who serve in combat , 94 per cent of who come back will not offend			1
’ screening within the armed forces to identify at - risk individuals would not work , he argued			0
for every correct prediction there were likely to be five that were wrong			0
however he said his group had started conducting random mental health checks on several thousand members of the armed forces returning from active duty			0
in the @entity161 , this is a routine procedure			0
commenting on the report , a @entity163 spokesman said : ‘ we are committed to supporting members of our @entity167 and their families as they return to civilian life post deployment			0
‘ that is why we funded this research and have comprehensive mental health support available before , during and after operations			0
we also ensure that all personnel go through a thorough period of decompression to help make this adjustment			0
‘ this report recognises that the vast majority of service personnel make this adjustment successfully and are not more likely to commit a violent offence post deployment - there is only an increased risk of 2 per cent when compared to the general population			1
‘ however , any violent offence is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by our armed forces			2
if a member of our @entity167 or their family experiences violence there is a wide range of support and help available to them			0
’ @entity195 , 24 , shot his landlady @entity196 with a shotgun at point - blank range when he returned from @entity26			0
but he was convicted with manslaughter rather than murder because he was suffering with post traumatic stress disorder at the time of the killing			0
the court was told @entity195 had been badly affected by seeing three @entity26 soldiers blown up by a @entity207 bomb			2
@entity195 was convicted of manslaughter after shooting his landlady while suffering from ptsd on his return from @entity211 worked on a game farm run by mother - of - two @entity213			0
@entity196 had taken in @entity195 and treated him like a member of her own family @entity195 worked for her and lived at her home in @entity217 , near @entity218			0
she had taken him in a decade earlier when he was homeless after being thrown out by his mother , and treated him like a member of the family			0
after his tour in 2010 @entity195 talked constantly about his time in @entity26 with the @entity224 , wore combat clothing and held a shotgun as if he was carrying an @entity41 rifle			2
he even carried a piece of shrapnel in a jar that had been pulled out of his thigh after a mortar attack			0
when mrs @entity196 ordered him to leave in january 2011 , he snapped and killed her with three blasts from a shotgun			0
he then dialled 999 and told the operator : ‘ i have done something absolutely terrible ... i just had a moment of madness			0
’ the court heard the combination of @entity242 ’s and @entity209 left him unlikely to be able to exercise self - control			1
colleague @entity244 said during his service @entity195 often built a campfire on his own away from other troops			0
on one occasion he heard @entity195 laughing and discovered he had skewered a cat with a red - hot poker			0
he was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to his ptsd and @entity242 's syndrome .			0
