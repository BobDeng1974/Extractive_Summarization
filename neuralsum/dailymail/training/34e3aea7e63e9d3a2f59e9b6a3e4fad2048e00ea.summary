by @entity0 soldiers are set to get a @entity3 - like augmented reality system designed for the battlefield			1
called @entity6 , it allows commanders to send maps and other information directly to the soldier 's field of vison			1
the gadget attaches to a military helmet , and can even be integrated with weapons control system			1
the system can overlay key information such as the location of enemies , satellite footage and mission objectives rather than looking down at a @entity30 map or chest - worn computer , the soldier sees virtual icons ( such as navigation waypoints , friendly / blue forces , and aircraft ) overlaid on their real - world view			1
the software will run on a specially adapted display that clips onto helmets , or on a range of existing ar goggles			0
it can track exactly where a user is looking and adjust the display accordingly			0
the firm behind it , @entity46 , says the system was developed as part of a six year project with substantial investment from the @entity54 's @entity53 unit			1
' we worked closely with warﬁghters throughout the design , analysis , and ﬁeld testing phases of the program , ' the firm said			0
rather than looking down at a @entity30 map or chest - worn computer , the soldier sees virtual icons ( such as navigation waypoints , friendly / blue forces , and aircraft ) overlaid on their real - world view			0
' you are able to perform your mission with high awareness of their surroundings , with enhanced safety , speed , and in close coordination with team members , ' @entity46 claims			0
' this state - of - the - art technology provides heads - up situational awareness for the military – allowing soldiers to perform their jobs with enhanced safety , speed , and mission effectiveness , ' the firm said			0
however , it could also be used in logistics and even by the public			0
how it works : the system is connected to control units on the soldier 's body			1
information is sent wirelessly to the soldier and displayed over one of their eyes			1
as well as military uses , the new system could be used for : consumer products : real - world object tagging and sharing for socially networked users @entity102 : shared awareness for emergency management and response logistics and operations : tracking assets , personnel , and tasks for worksites and events immersive training and gaming : virtual avatars and effects embedded with live operations the software will run on a specially adapted display that clips onto helmets , or on a range of existing ar goggles			1
it can track exactly where a user is looking and adjust the display accordingly			0
the gadget 's lead engineer , @entity127 , said it is ' a flat - out game changer that ’s ideal for anyone who wants to visualize , create , and share heads - up information			2
' @entity6 will change the way you see and interact with the world around you – the same way the smart phone changed the way you communicate			2
' the firm experimented with dozens of prototypes for the system before deciding on the final model ( left ) the @entity6 software renders ar information on any wearable see - through display – including night vision devices , making it easy to integrate with existing product			1
the firm also says its system is more advanced that @entity153 's @entity3			2
' @entity154 does more than present conventional communications and directional information ( e.g. , messages , tweets , maps , pictures ) in a heads - up fashion			2
' @entity6 is transforming your view of the world with digital tags that persist as if painted on physical objects			0
imagine it as virtual grafﬁti			0

@entity6 system designed to fit onto a helmet and give live *updates*
can overlay maps and other information onto soldier 's vision
