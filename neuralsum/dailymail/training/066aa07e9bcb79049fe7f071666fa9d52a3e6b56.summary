by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 08:59 est , 10 september 2013 for most mothers , the school run is an unglamorous affair			1
@entity5 hair , tracksuit bottoms and chipped manicures become de rigueur as they rush to drag the children out of bed , make their packed lunches and cajole them into the car			2
but for a certain breed of mothers , the school run is a whole different ball game			1
writing an anonymous piece in @entity18 today , one mother has lifted the lid on what life is really like at the celebrity school gate			1
' welcome to the high - octane , caffeine - fuelled , fashion savvy domain			0
here , morning drop - off is no ordinary jam - smeared , bleary - eyed routine			0
' in fact , celeb - spotting aficionados would be far better placed to set up camp here than at the @entity55 during award season , ' writes the mother , whose children share lessons with the celeb offspring			0
the writer describes her first day at the celebrity school gate , which she describes as a ' parallel universe ' , where appearances count for everything			1
' with their glossy manes , expensive highlights and @entity71 - honed thighs , this was a new breed of woman - an uberbeing , perpetually ready for her close - up , ' she said			0
she explains how each ' tribe ' of stylish mothers define themselves by their choice of handbag			2
picture perfect : ' with their glossy manes , expensive highlights and @entity71 - honed thighs , this was a new breed of woman - an uberbeing ' , says the writer of the mothers at @entity38 and @entity37 's children 's schools @entity87 are the choice of arm candy by the ' cougar ' mothers , who desperately try to emulate @entity34 , whilst the ' fashion mums ' rock none other than a @entity33 tote and @entity37 's minions , known as the ' boho mums ' , love their @entity98 bags			2
no handbag , however , is the biggest statement of power and wealth a mother can make			2
these mothers are the ones who are chauffeured to school in a black - out @entity108 , meaning their driver is on hand to guard their @entity112 tote whilst they accompany their children to the school gate , the anonymous mother writes			1
fitness fanatics : gym gear is obligatory at the school gate , as mothers dash off to their ten pilates class or @entity121 whilst leather leggings a la @entity34 were once the school gate outfit of choice , this has recently been replaced by super stylish gym gear			1
the current trend , she explains , is to match their trainers to the neon stripe in their gym leggings before dashing off to their ten pilates or @entity133			1
then there are the super skinny mothers who do n't need to exercise at all because they do n't bother eating			0
' they decamp to a cafe near the school for a daily debrief			0
whilst sipping their double - shot soya lattes and inhaling @entity143 , they will dispense their verdicts - picture @entity144 on steroids , ' she writes			0
judging by the latest research , looking good on the school run is n't just a preoccupation of the the rich and famous			1
a study by @entity151 found that ' what mums should wear back to school ' searches have increased by 40 per cent this year			0
another survey found that mothers spend an average of Â£ 87 to look good on the school run with the average mother spending up to 25 minutes perfecting her hair and make - up and deciding what to wear in preparation for the big day			1
amazingly , that 's around seven minutes longer than it will take them to get the children ready			0
