before a new car can be allowed on the road , it must undergo vigorous testing to ensure it is safe both for its occupants and other cars and pedestrians			0
but @entity9 wants to streamline this process by being allowed to test its upcoming driverless cars in virtual reality before they hit the roads			1
the company has apparently built a digital simulation of the @entity18 road system , and wants its cars to be certified based on their performance in this virtual world			1
@entity9 wants officials to allow the company to test its cars in a virtual world before they hit real roads			1
the company has apparently developed a digital simulation that the cars can drive around in ( 3d mapping software of the cars shown ) and test their abilities before they head out into the real world mean streets : @entity9 cars have driven about 700,000 accident - free miles ( 1.1 million km ) on motorways in ' autonomous mode '			1
@entity9 has been focusing on city driving for the past year			2
to - do list : @entity9 's @entity41 are retrofitted with lasers , radar and cameras rapidly learned how to handle thousands of urban driving situations			1
improvements are needed in merging and lane changes , turning right on red and handling bad weather			0
local tests : so far , the tech giant has focused on street driving in @entity52 , @entity18			2
the state , along with , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , have formally opened public streets to testing of self - driving cars			2
the future is ( almost ) here : in 2012 , @entity9 co-founder @entity63 predicted that the public would be able to get hold of the technology within five years			2
this prediction has not been revised			0
@entity9 , the carmaker : while @entity9 has enough money to invest in making cars , that likelihood is remote			1
industry experts believe more likely options include collaborating with major car makers or giving away the software , as @entity9 did with its android operating system			2
the plans to lobby officials to allow the development were revealed by @entity79			2
@entity9 claims that testing in a virtual world is actually safer , as more eventualities can be accounted for			1
and ‘ they allow manufacturers to test their software under far more conditions and stresses than could possibly be achieved on a test track , ’ safety director @entity82 reportedly wrote to @entity18 state officials earlier this year			1
the simulation is based on intricate mapping of 2,000 miles ( 3,200 km ) of road in @entity18			2
the car 's software is then tasked with driving around this virtual world , which includes other cars and pedestrians to avoid			1
however , while the cars are adept at traversing this route , it is just a small part of the 172,000 miles ( 277,000 km ) of road in the state alone			0
and even before @entity9 begins similar mapping processes in other cities , it is yet to seek approval from @entity18 for their virtual reality testing idea			1
in addition , the system so far has only been used in the rather balmy and dry conditions in @entity18			1
their digital simulation has not yet been challenged with testing weather conditions such as , for example , a wet and windy day in the @entity118 when more care must be taken when driving			1
@entity9 's simulation is based on intricate mapping of 2,000 miles ( 3,200 km ) of road in @entity18			1
the car 's software is then tasked with driving around this virtual world			1
however , while the cars ( shown ) are adept at traversing this route , it is just a small part of the 172,000 miles ( 277,000 km ) of road in the state alone the move follows the announcement that @entity9 's self - driving cars will be designed to exceed maximum speed limits , in a move to improve safety			1
@entity136 , the lead software engineer for the project , revealed the vehicles will go 10mph ( 16km ) faster than the speed limit			0
the purpose is to avoid the @entity9 car being significantly slower than speeding vehicles around it , which would increase the risk of an accident			0
mr @entity136 said research showed that sticking to the speed limit when other cars are speeding can be dangerous			0
therefore , the car ’s speed would be altered depending on traffic conditions , @entity148 reported			0
the same radar and camera system used for collision avoidance would be used to monitor the speed of other cars and match to them accordingly			0
there will be a limit , however , and if another car is dramatically speeding then @entity9 's driverless car will go no faster			1
but mr @entity136 did not elaborate on how the feature would work with speed cameras or mobile police , and whether it could incur a speeding fine			0
@entity9 hopes the autonomous cars will drastically reduce accidents on the roads			1
the prototype two - seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive			0
the car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing			0
the route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to @entity189 , the leader of @entity9 's self - driving car team			2
the car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles ( 160 km ) before charging			0
its shape suggests a rounded - out @entity195 - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face			0
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
in these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph ( 40 km / h ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity9 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			0
ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity9 's extended maps service			2
driving works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			0
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights .			0

@entity239 says it has built detailed digital streets of @entity18 's roads
and they say they are good enough to test their cars in virtual reality
@entity9 claims it is safer to test their cars in a ' matrix ' than the real world
they are currently seeking approval from officials for the development
but they are yet to test out other conditions in the virtual world such as wet and windy weather encountered in the @entity118
