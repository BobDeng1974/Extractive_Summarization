@entity1 , the former neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot @entity2 in a 2012 confrontation with the teenager , will not face federal charges , the @entity0 said on tuesday			1
the decision , announced in the waning days of attorney general @entity8 's tenure , resolves a case that focused on self - defense gun laws and became a flashpoint in the national conversation about race two years before the @entity16 , @entity17 , police shooting			0
@entity1 has said he acted in self - defense when he shot the 17 - year - old @entity2 during a confrontation inside a gated community in @entity21 , @entity22 , just outside @entity23			1
@entity2 , who was black , was unarmed when he was killed			0
that probe focused on whether the killing amounted to a federal civil rights violation , which would have required proof that it was motivated by racial animosity			2
although @entity2 's parents have said @entity1 initiated the fight , the @entity0 said there was not enough evidence to establish that @entity1 willfully deprived @entity2 of his civil rights - a difficult legal standard to meet - or killed the teenager on account of his race			1
this decision is limited strictly to the department 's inability to meet the high legal standard required to prosecute the case under the federal civil rights statutes ; it does not reflect an assessment of any other aspect of the shooting , ' the @entity0 said in a news release announcing the decision tuesday			1
@entity1 's attorney , @entity59 , was on a flight and could n't immediately comment on the decision			0
@entity2 's parents were too distraught after their meeting in @entity65 with @entity0 officials to speak with reporters , their attorney @entity62 said			1
protests : thousands took to the streets across @entity71 after @entity1 was acquitted of second - degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17 - year - old @entity2 the @entity0 's decision not to file federal charges against @entity1 was expected but still ' a bitter pill to swallow , ' he said			1
' what they told his family and i was that because @entity2 was n't able to tell us his version of events , there was a lack of evidence to bring the charges			2
that 's the tragedy , ' @entity62 said			0
later the family did release a statement in which they said they were ' disappointed ' by the findings			0
' although we are disappointed in these findings , it has steeled our resolve to continue traveling the country with the message of the @entity101 which is dedicated to protecting our youth and empowering those who demand justice and peace , ' said @entity2 's family in a statement			1
' we remain poised to do everything in our power to help eradicate senseless violence in our communities , because we do n't want any other parent to experience the unexplainable loss we have endured			0
' we will never , ever forget what happened to our son , @entity2 , and will honor his memory by working tirelessly to make the world a better place			1
' anger : demonstrators gather in @entity122 's @entity121 to demanded justice a day after @entity1 was found not guilty the february 2012 confrontation began after @entity1 saw @entity2 while driving in his neighborhood			1
@entity1 called police and got out of his car and approached @entity2 , who was returning from a store while visiting his father and his father 's fiancee at the same townhome complex where @entity1 lived			2
@entity1 did not testify at his trial , but he told investigators that he feared for his life as @entity2 straddled him and punched him during the fight			2
the decision to not prosecute @entity1 comes even though @entity8 has made civil rights a cornerstone of his tenure			2
the @entity0 is also moving to resolve a separate high - profile civil rights case - the august shooting by a @entity16 police officer of @entity145 , an unarmed black 18 - year - old			1
the killing sparked weeks of protests			0
days after @entity1 was acquitted , @entity8 said he considered @entity2 's death an ' unnecessary shooting			1
' in a news release on tuesday , @entity8 echoed remarks he made in the shooting 's aftermath			0
' though a comprehensive investigation found that the high standard for a federal hate crime prosecution can not be met under the circumstances here , this young man 's premature death necessitates that we continue the dialogue and be unafraid of confronting the issues and tensions his passing brought to the surface , ' @entity8 said			0
' we , as a nation , must take concrete steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future			0
