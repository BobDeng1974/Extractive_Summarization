by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 17:17 est , 2 february 2013 as a maternity nurse to the stars , @entity1 has cared for countless celebrity babies , with actresses @entity5 and @entity7 among her clients			1
@entity10 credits @entity1 with helping her daughter @entity12 sleep through the night at just six weeks old			1
@entity14 , who is a single mother , praised her extraordinary ‘ calmness and knowledge ’			0
and now @entity1 , who charges £ 280 for a 24 - hour home visit , has written a book to teach those of us not blessed with an a-list budget how to get a child to sleep			1
magic touch : supernanny to the stars , @entity1 helps @entity0 find the best way of putting her 5 - week - old son @entity28 to bed at night it was a pressing issue for me last month : my son @entity28 was three weeks old and i had n’t had more than two hours of uninterrupted sleep since his arrival			1
coupled with the exertions of caring for my boisterous two - year - old daughter @entity37 , tiredness was transforming me into a wreck			0
so i was eager to meet @entity1 and road - test her methods			1
could she turn my unsettled newborn into a sleeping - through - the - night miracle ? @entity1 ’s advice is based on the way she brought up her three children in the @entity47			1
she believes babies today are given the status of ‘ @entity50 ’ , with their mother ’s wellbeing often neglected			1
she suggests three - hour feeding routines , leaving your baby to cry , introducing a bottle , and even putting the baby in a separate room overnight			1
‘ mothers are fed too much worry nowadays			0
i ’m strict about them getting rest , ’ says @entity1 , 65 , now a grandmother of five who lives with her husband @entity61 , 75 , a retired farmer , in @entity62			1
unsurprisingly , those who advocate the increasingly popular ‘ attachment ’ style of parenting – in which babies feed and sleep whenever they choose , often sleeping in the same bed as the mother – question her @entity76 - sounding methods			1
best supporting role : @entity7 hired @entity1 to help with baby @entity78 so where does her approach come from ? @entity1 ’s own mother employed a maternity nurse to put @entity83 and her five siblings on a strict routine as babies in the @entity87 – so this is an obvious influence			1
in 1964 , @entity1 trained as a maternity nurse at a @entity91 ’s children ’s home , where following a routine was the only way of looking after the hundreds of babies in her care			1
‘ it was just the way things were done , ’ she says			0
in the following decade , there was a backlash in parenting methods and @entity1 found herself in the minority			1
‘ my friends were feeding their babies on demand and they were all over the place , ’ she says			1
most of my friends with babies favour attachment parenting			1
but i found myself agreeing with @entity1 ’s methods			1
i was put on a routine as a baby and left to cry on occasion , and i do n’t think it has done me any harm			1
after following her book for a couple of weeks , i was lucky enough to be granted a visit from the woman herself			1
within moments of arriving at my home , she had @entity37 wanting to hold her hand and @entity28 fast asleep			0
clearly , she has a magic touch			0
@entity124 : @entity5 used @entity1 to get baby @entity12 to sleep the first step , @entity1 says , to get your baby to sleep is making sure they are well fed , even if that means topping up breast - feeds with the much - maligned formula			1
she says : ‘ anyone would think formula was poison			0
babies do just as well on it			1
’ @entity1 said i should also be expressing milk			1
‘ it ’s important to introduce a bottle , ’ she says			0
‘ i do it within two weeks			0
it gives you flexibility and it ’s good for dad to be able to feed the baby too			1
’ i dug out my breast pump			0
the more milk i pumped , the more i produced , leading to painful breasts			0
while @entity28 took to the bottle immediately , it did n’t feel fair asking my husband @entity155 , a financial analyst , to do overnight feeds when he had to be up at 6am			0
@entity1 believes leaving even the tiniest babies to cry themselves to sleep is an essential part of teaching them healthy long - term sleeping habits			1
she leaves tired newborns to have a ‘ little shout ’ for ten minutes before she picks them up , and has , on occasion , left young babies for up to half an hour			1
‘ i would n’t give a time limit because every baby is different , but do n’t pick them up too soon or get into the habit of holding or suckling them to sleep , ’ she says			1
it is easier said than done			0
a newborn ’s scream can pierce the most hardened mother ’s heart , and even if – like me – she is prepared to leave her baby to cry , she will worry about being judged by well - meaning friends and relatives			1
with @entity37 , i ’d pick her up almost immediately			0
but , bolstered by @entity1 ’s words , i left @entity28 to cry for the first time at 1am during one particularly fractious night			1
with my head under the pillow , i waited for ten minutes			2
after that he had two more , shorter , crying fits until , at 1.30am , he finally gave up and went to sleep			2
every minute felt interminable , and by the end i was crying too			0
‘ it is incredibly upsetting , ’ @entity1 acknowledges			1
‘ but you ’re not leaving a cold , hungry baby to scream			2
they are fed , clean and warm			0
’ @entity1 believes babies should sleep and feed at about the same time every day and puts any healthy baby who weighs more than 6lb 8oz into a three - hourly routine when they are just a week old			1
the bigger the baby , the longer they can go between feeds			2
at 9lb 1oz aged three weeks , @entity28 could last four hours			0
‘ the word routine has horrible connotations but babies thrive on it , ’ says @entity1			1
a baby ’s first feed , she says , should be at 7am			2
within an hour and a half , they will be ready for a nap			0
between 10am and 11am , they will feed again , before taking at least a two - hour lunchtime nap			0
between 2pm and 3pm , they will have another feed , followed by another nap			0
after an early - evening feed at about 6pm , they will be put to bed at 7pm			0
they will have a later evening feed between 10pm and 11pm and will – hopefully – sleep until the early hours			2
it was n’t exactly a schedule @entity28 and i were running to			0
i had left him to sleep until after 8am and nap intermittently in the day before cuddling him all evening			2
forcing myself out of bed at 7am felt unnecessary			0
but it helped , because i felt i was taking control			2
by 8am , @entity28 was yawning and he slept until 10.30am			0
but he did n’t always comply with @entity1 ’s schedule			1
sometimes he refused to sleep in the afternoon			2
the evenings were the most difficult , as @entity28 would n’t sleep for more than half an hour at a time			2
‘ some people carry babies round , others leave them to holler , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ some feed them on and off all evening , which is not what i would do			0
i would tuck the baby down , have supper , maybe rock their cot , and if they have n’t settled by 9.30pm i would do another feed			2
’ i persevered with her suggestion of feeding , leaving to cry , picking up after ten minutes to hug and putting back in the cot , until , when @entity28 was five weeks old , our evenings became less fractured			2
he did n’t always sleep soundly , but he usually stopped crying for long enough to let us have dinner in peace			2
@entity1 believes that after a month , babies should move into their own room			1
even when asleep , @entity28 kept me awake by grunting			0
i was reliant on ear plugs and my husband fled to the spare room in week one			0
‘ so many girls have their child in bed with them and dad sleeping in a different room , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ this is n’t right for family life			0
’ but research has shown that sleeping in the same room as your baby for their first four months reduces the risk of cot death			2
‘ @entity266 forbid anything should happen but cot death is very silent			0
they ’re not going to shout out and it wo n’t make any difference			0
when they are in a @entity274 basket , babies can sleep anywhere , ’ @entity1 counters			1
‘ put them in the bathroom			0
’ i put @entity28 in our en suite , but i lost more sleep than ever worrying that some dreadful fate should befall him , so i abandoned it after two nights			2
@entity1 advocates swaddling before they are put to bed until they are three months old			1
certainly , the effect of swaddling on @entity28 was incredible			0
he stopped startling himself awake and seemed more content			0
a month on , @entity28 – now nearly eight weeks – is still unsettled in the evenings but usually able to get himself back to sleep after a hug			2
i have learned to leave him to cry without guilt			0
his daytime naps are gaining structure			0
best of all has been his progress overnight			0
those two - hour sleeps stretched to five and six hours			0
one night last week , to my joy and disbelief , he slept through to 7am			2
as for me , well , i ’m still shattered , kept awake by the anxiety that comes with caring for a newborn			0
but i ’m hoping that soon i will catch up on sleep , and the fog of new motherhood will lift			2
