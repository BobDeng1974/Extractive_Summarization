after @entity1 he 's the world 's most recognised lifeguard but @entity4 's chief lifesaver @entity3 says it 's not all fun in the sun , shark - spotting and getting chatted up by girls			1
the 46 - year - old grew up on @entity13 's @entity12 beach and got into lifesaving as a casual job when he was still at school			1
fast forward 23 years and he 's performed thousands of rescues but says the scariest one was when they struggled with a semi-conscious snorkeller who was drowning and smashing onto the rocks at @entity22			1
it 's a tough life , but someone 's got to do it ! @entity4 's head lifesaver @entity26 details the famous crew 's exploits in new book stories from the @entity31 which documents day - to - day life on the beach and if it was n't for his 23 years of lifesaving experience the struggling swimmer could have been a goner			1
' i was working on @entity22 with @entity40 ( fellow lifeguard @entity41 ) ' , he tells the @entity42			1
' and a guy from @entity44 or one of the islands had jumped off the rocks to go snorkelling but the surf was huge and he was just getting smashed around			1
' his wife had called us , terrified , and he was struggling to stay up because he kept getting pulled under and thrown into the rocks and as soon as we got there i knew we were in trouble			1
' we 'd gone out with tubes , flippers and a rescue board each and he was a big guy , around 130 kilos and kept sinking the board			1
he was in a bad way and at times only semi conscious			1
' we had to keep swapping the rescue boards and then putting the tubes around him to try and stop him getting bashed from the impact			1
it was touch and go and took us a long time , about 30 minutes			1
living the dream ! just another day at the office for the crew , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity26 ' that 's when 23 years of experience comes in as that split - second decision can mean life or death , and if it was one of the younger guys it could have been a very different outcome			1
' the @entity4 boys , who start filming season 10 next month , shot to stardom in 2006 with their first series on @entity86 and it 's a massive hit worldwide			1
series 10 starts filming in december and they released a book this weekend , stories from the @entity31 , which details their lives and day - to - day responsibilities of the beach			2
' it 's like herding cattle ! ' @entity26 says the worst thing about his job is when people do n't swim between the flags the stars of the book are @entity26 and his mates , @entity41 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , and tells of the hilarious pranks they play on each other			1
like the time they set up an unwitting @entity73 and trainee @entity111 for a penalty shoot - out against one of the world 's top soccer players , @entity116 @entity113			1
the lifeguards have also rescued actor @entity118 's children from the ocean and tell how they were paid an impromptu visit from mr baywatch himself , @entity1			2
they scrub up well ! the cast on the red carpet at the 2014 @entity126 @entity125 in @entity13 ' we put the uniform on him and he thought he was back in @entity130 , ' laughs @entity3			1
' he 's massive , about 6ft 5 , and very funny			2
' he really enjoyed it and was telling us a few stories about his baywatch			0
sadly no @entity134 though - we 're still waiting for her to come down ! ' the lifeguards do n't get paid for the show but have been able to supplement their salary from promotional spin - offs and appearances , and ' @entity26 ' travels the world as a water safety consultant			0
' what keeps me in the job is the lifestyle and you get to meet a lot of people travelling around the world from different cultures , he adds			0
and the winner goes to ... @entity4 : @entity3 , @entity153 and @entity154 at the @entity155 in april			1
the series has won @entity157 in 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 and 2012 ' i was in @entity159 and an @entity161 guy came up to me			0
he was beside himself , saying excitedly , ' i ca n't believe i 've met you			0
' apparently the show 's very popular in @entity161 , which just blows me away			2
' and it definitely helps when i go overseas as i get a lot of water safety consulting in @entity167 and @entity168 so i already understand some of heir culture			0
' @entity22 is @entity13 's biggest tourist attraction after the @entity171 and @entity3 says the most annoying thing about the job is when people do n't swim in between the flags			1
' sometimes we can have 45,000 people on the beach and instead of swimming between the flags they 'll be like , ' oh , that spot looks nice and calm , i 'll go over there , ' but that 's where the rips are			2
catching waves : former world junior surfing champion @entity153 is @entity22 's only female lifeguard ' we try and educate them but when you 're dealing with that many people it 's impossible to have them all swimming in between the flags anyway so it 's a bit like herding cattle ! ' for anyone planning to head to @entity22 this summer , father - of - two @entity3 says the northern part of the beach is safest because , ' the rips pull a lot harder down south			1
' although he 's heading towards his fifth decade @entity3 , who also does a lot of yoga to stay supple and strong , says he 'll stay in the job as long as his body holds up but also has other projects			1
in september he launched @entity203 , a juice bar at the north beach which he hopes to turn it into a franchise a few years down the line			0
splice as nice : the @entity1 relives his baywatch days patrolling the beach to promote @entity212 ice cream ' it 's good to have alternatives , ' he adds			2
' the lifestyle 's great and i 've been doing this 23 years with my best friends but you 're only as good a lifeguard as your body allows			1
' i used to race a lot in my 20 's and 30 's which kept me fit but now it 's maintaining it so i 've had to change my routine a little bit			1
' i probably do n't do as much swimming and paddling as i used to but i now mix it up with yoga now and whatever else is needed			0
' because the job is so tough and physically demanding - not to mention dangerous - @entity3 says it 's not something he 'd encourage his two daughters , @entity233 , 16 and @entity234 , 12 , to go into			1
i 'm not going to push my daughters into anything , ' he says			0
' i 'm here to guide them but if they were to say they wanted to start going into it now i would be concerned and try and steer them away			0
' do hassle the @entity1 ! the former @entity130 star appeared in episode 3 of series 6 and according to @entity26 is , ' massive , about 6ft 5 , and very funny			0
we put the uniform on him and he thought he was back in @entity130 ' @entity22 has only had a few female lifeguards and former world junior surfing champion @entity153 is the current one			2
' we 're all for female life guards , ' he says			0
' but we do n't get that many applying			0
i think it takes a certain person to come into that culture and obviously it 's extremely physically demanding			2
' @entity153 has just come from the pro-surfing tour and has surfed all around the world so she really knows the ocean and is extremely strong			0
and she can hold her own			0
' sardines : in the summer months approximately 2.2million people flock to @entity13 's famous @entity22 in stories from the @entity261 talks about the first time he came face - to - face with a shark , just before the tv show started			2
' when @entity74 and i were working on the first pilot , ' he writes			0
' a guy knocked on the door and said , ' look i have just seen a massive shark out at the point there			0
' ' i said ' oh yeah ? ' well it 's a seal probably '			2
we get a lot of seals around here			0
with my luck it may be a mermaid ! or it might have been a dolphin			0
' he said , ' look mate , i have been around here a long time , and i surf and @entity287 fish , and this one is massive '			0
then people started ringing into the tower			0
' i 'm not going to push my daughters into anything , ' @entity3 , pictured here with @entity233 and @entity234 , says			1
' but if they were to say they wanted to start going into it now i would be concerned as it 's so physically tough ' ' the guys on the cameras got really excited – wow they were going to get a shark in the first show ! ' so i went out on the jet ski and could n't see anything for half an hour			2
all i could see were about 100 people on the headland screaming at me and pointing at the ocean			0
' then i saw the fin come up – it was around 18 - foot and it was a @entity308 – they got a shot of it and the shot went international			0
then we got the show two days later ! surprise surprise ! the early days : @entity4 lifeguards : ( @entity70 ) @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity26 and @entity319 attend @entity86 's @entity320 at the @entity321 in @entity13 unsurprisingly @entity3 is against the shark - culling that the government trialed earlier this year after a spate of attacks , saying : ' obviously it 's very tragic when a shark attack happens			1
' but more people in @entity329 die from bee - stings than shark attacks			0
they do n't search out humans , it usually happens when they are chasing food and it 's been in the wrong place at the wrong time			2
' the more sharks you take out of the water affects the ocean , which affects the food chain and everything else			0
each time we go into the water we 're guests in their playground , their environment			0

he 's done thousands of rescues but one where a snorkeller was getting smashed against the rocks was the scariest
it took @entity3 and fellow lifeguard and friend @entity356 30 minutes to rescue the semi conscious man and get him back to shore
it was ' touch and go ' because he kept sinking the surfboard , and if it was a less experienced lifeguard carrying out the rescue the man could have died
