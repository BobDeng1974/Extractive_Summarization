a few sundays ago during a game against the @entity3 , @entity1 rookie wide receiver @entity0 made the catch seen round the world , breaking the internet in a way that has only recently been eclipsed by the sight of @entity10 's bare bottom			1
@entity11 has backed up that outstanding play with two great games in a row for the @entity1 and is on pace to go over 1,000 yards and catch more than 75 passes despite missing all of september because of an injury			0
he ’s had at least six catches and 90 receiving yards in six straight games and has scored six touchdowns thus far			0
the @entity1 are trying to get the ball in the 22 - year - old ’s hands as much as possible and have handed off to him in three straight games and even had @entity0 uncork a deep bomb to fellow wide receiver @entity28 during a trick play against the @entity30 on sunday			1
@entity31 announced himself to the world with this astonishing catch against the @entity3 @entity0 celebrates after scoring a touchdown against the @entity30			1
he has six to his name this season in a twist that should n’t be that surprising , it turns out the talented rookie is n’t just skilled at the @entity40 brand of football			2
@entity11 might not exactly be @entity42 , but he may have a career in the @entity44 to fall back on if things in the @entity46 do n’t work out			1
a senior college football columnist wrote this about @entity0 in @entity50 the @entity46 draft : ' @entity42 is a fantastic athlete			1
you 're talking about a guy who is really explosive ; could 've been an elite soccer player , can throw the ball very well with either hand ; has excellent return skills and some of the best hands in the draft			2
the coaches i know at @entity61 say he could 've played any position in their secondary and been a star there too			0
' anyone who has seen the catch @entity42 made against the @entity3 would likely agree that the hands comment is perfectly accurate , but saying @entity0 could have been ‘ elite ’ at soccer / football sounds like hyperbole right ? maybe not			1
@entity0 warms up alongside @entity1 coach @entity73 in @entity74 during the @entity75 over the summer , @entity0 said : ‘ my coach actually tried to get me on the national team when i was like 13 or 14			1
but to do the soccer thing , you really have to go overseas and stuff like that , and it was a decision at a young age that i really did n’t want to leave my family			2
’ ‘ it was kind of one of those things that i had to let it go even though i still think about it to this day			0
soccer is my first love			0
i have n't done it in a while , but any chance i get to put a soccer ball by my feet , i 'll definitely mess around with it			0
’ that appears to be true ... he may be able to bend it like @entity42 , but the former @entity101 captain is n’t @entity11 ’s favourite player			2
he said : ' i really like @entity104 , @entity105 ( who plays for @entity107 ’s national team ) , just respect greatness			0
@entity109 and ( @entity110 ) @entity110 from @entity111 ( and @entity112 )			0
' if he switches his brand of professional football immediately , @entity0 might have the chance to take on @entity110 or @entity105 during the next @entity75 in 2018 as a member of the @entity40 team			1
as he proved with his one - handed grab against @entity120 , anything is possible .			0

at no 12 overall , @entity31 was the third wideout selected in the 2014 @entity46 draft
if he was n’t *tearing* it up on the *gridiron* , @entity0 would be *impressing* on the pitch
he is *outshining* no 4 pick @entity129 and no 7 pick @entity131
