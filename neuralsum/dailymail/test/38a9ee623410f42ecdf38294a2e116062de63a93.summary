@entity0 take on @entity1 in their @entity3 semi-final encounter on sunday with the competition both sides ' last chance to win any silverware this season			1
@entity10 columnist @entity9 looks ahead to the @entity12 showdown and where the match could be won and lost with individual player duels			1
@entity17 v @entity15 this will be a heavyweight contest that could decide the game			0
@entity17 is superb in the air and @entity15 will have his hands full			0
@entity1 have to stop the supply line because defending crosses has been their achilles heel this season			2
@entity17 ( centre ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity0 won 1 - 0 at @entity30 on april 11 @entity1 defender @entity15 ( right ) will have his hands full trying to stop @entity17 on sunday afternoon @entity33 v @entity31 this should be a good contest between two @entity37 team - mates			1
@entity33 ’s new deal was a real boost for @entity0 - he drives that midfield , though he does n’t get enough goals			2
you used to say the same about @entity31 but he has improved so much			0
@entity37 international @entity33 ( left ) and @entity31 are set for a midfield battle at @entity12 @entity48 v @entity46 and @entity49 @entity46 and @entity49 make an imposing back line but they would rather be up against a @entity17 than a @entity48 , who will float around and make himself difficult to mark so he can use his lightning pace to get in behind them			0
@entity48 's ( left ) pace and trickery is bound to cause the @entity0 defence a lot of problems @entity46 ( left ) was part of the @entity0 defence that kept a clean sheet at @entity30 in the @entity61 the @entity62 international and @entity49 ( right ) will be hoping to do likewise against the @entity64 at @entity12			1
