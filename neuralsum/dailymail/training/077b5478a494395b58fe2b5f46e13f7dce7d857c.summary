by @entity0 at 1,200 feet wide , it could have caused an explosion measured in megatons and would have wiped out a city if it were to hit @entity5			1
just days ago , a huge asteroid nicknamed ' the @entity7 ' passed less than a million miles from us			1
today , @entity9 revealed it captured these stunning images as it passed by - thankfully at a safe distance			1
to obtain the new views , researchers paired the 230 - foot ( 70 - meter ) @entity22 antenna at @entity23 , @entity24 , with two other radio telescopes , one at a time			1
using this technique , the @entity23 antenna beams a radar signal at an asteroid and the other antenna receives the reflections			1
the technique dramatically improves the amount of detail that can be seen in radar @entity36 image 2014 @entity18 , the researchers first paired the large @entity23 antenna with the 1,000 - foot ( 305 - meter ) @entity40 radio telescope in @entity41			1
they later paired the large @entity23 dish with a smaller companion , a 112 - foot ( 34 - meter ) antenna , located about 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) away			1
a recent equipment upgrade at @entity40 enabled the two facilities to work in tandem to obtain images with this fine level of detail for the first time			2
captured on june 8 , 2014 , the new views of the object designated ' 2014 @entity18 ' are some of the most detailed radar images of a near - @entity5 asteroid ever obtained			2
the radar observations were led by scientists @entity57 and @entity59 of @entity9 's @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity24			2
the @entity60 researchers worked closely with @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 at @entity40 in @entity41 to plan and execute the observations			2
according to @entity59 , 2014 @entity18 appears to be an elongated , irregular object that is at least 1,200 feet ( 370 meters ) wide on its long axis			2
' this may be a double object , or ' contact binary , ' consisting of two objects that form a single asteroid with a lobed shape , ' he said			2
the images reveal a wealth of other features , including a puzzling pointy hill near the object 's middle , on top as seen in the images			2
the 21 radar images were taken over a span of four - and - a - half hours			2
during that interval , the asteroid rotated a few degrees per frame , suggesting its rotation period is slightly less than 24 hours			2
at its closest approach to @entity5 on june 8 , the asteroid came within 776,000 miles ( 1.25 million kilometers ) , or slightly more than three times the distance to the moon			1
scientists began observations of 2014 @entity18 shortly after the closest approach , when the asteroid was between about 864,000 miles and 902,000 miles ( 1.39 million kilometers and 1.45 million kilometers ) from @entity5			1
each image in the collage and movie represents 10 minutes of data			2
the new views show features as small as about 12 feet ( 3.75 meters ) wide			0
this is the highest resolution currently possible using scientific radar antennas to produce images			0
such sharp views for this asteroid were made possible by linking together two giant radio telescopes to enhance their capabilities			0
to obtain the new views , researchers paired the 230 - foot ( 70 - meter ) @entity22 antenna at @entity23 , @entity24 , with two other radio telescopes , one at a time			0
' by itself , the @entity23 antenna can obtain images that show features as small as the width of a traffic lane on the highway , " said @entity59			0
' with @entity40 now able to receive our highest - resolution @entity23 signals , we can create a single system that improves the overall quality of the images			0
' the first five images in the new sequence -- the top row in the collage -- represent the data collected by @entity40 , and are 30 times brighter than what @entity23 can produce observing on its own			0
the newfound asteroid will safely pass @entity5 on june 8 from a distance of about 777,000 miles ( 1.25 million kilometers ) , more than three times farther away than our moon			1
designated 2014 @entity137 , the asteroid was discovered april 23 , 2014 , by @entity9 's @entity140 mission , a space telescope adapted for scouting the skies for asteroids and comets			0
the telescope sees infrared light , which allows it to pick up the infrared glow of asteroids and obtain better estimates of their true sizes			0
2014 @entity18 is designated a ' potentially hazardous asteroid , ' or @entity153			0
this refers to those asteroids 460 feet ( 140 meters ) in size or larger that pass within 4.6 million miles ( 7.4 million kilometers ) of @entity5 's orbit around the sun. there are currently 1,484 known @entity160 , but none pose a significant near - term risk of impacting @entity5			1
it is tearing through space at 31,000 miles per hour or 50,400 kilometers per hour			1
it will , however , pass within a million miles on sunday - equivalent to 3.2 lunar distances or about 716,500 miles			1
' there is zero chance of an impact , ' said @entity170 , manager of @entity9 's @entity171 at @entity9 's @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity24			0
' in fact , it 's fairly common for asteroids to pass near @entity5			0
' you 'd expect an object about the size of 2014 @entity18 to pass this close every few years			0
' astronomers say their main concern is that @entity7 , or asteroid 2014 @entity18 was only detected on april 23 before its nearest approach to the @entity5 despite space surveillance systems scanning outer space for asteroids and other threats			1
' @entity18 is at least 10 times bigger , and possibly 20 times , than the asteroid that injured a thousand people last year in @entity192 , @entity193 , ' @entity188 space telescope astronomer @entity186 said			0
' if it were [ to ] impact us , the energy released would be measured not in kilotons like the atomic bombs that ended @entity197 , but in h - bomb type megatons			0
' @entity199 said that object was ' maybe the size of a movie theatre , ' while @entity9 compared its size to a bus			0
' it 's not a super-large one			0
you call it @entity7 , but there are much bigger ones , ' @entity211 physicist @entity210 , an expert on planetary impacts , told @entity188 during the webcast			1
' we 've discovered most of the ones greater than a kilometre			0
' experts say the asteroid would wipe out an entire city and be similar to a nuclear warhead detonating if @entity5 were to be hit @entity210 said that a planetary strike with an object the size of @entity18 would have a catastrophic effect			1
' it 's moving at a relative speed of 14 kilometres per second			0
' but if it were headed toward us , gravity would speed it up and it would hit the @entity5 with a speed of 18 kilometres a second , ' he said			0
based on its size , and assuming it would still be a solid rock at the time of impact , it would lead to an explosion of about 2,000 megatonnes , enough to wipe out an entire metropolitan area , ' @entity210 said			1
@entity7 was discovered by the @entity240			1
it is tearing through space at 31,000 miles per hour or 50,400 kilometers per hour			1
@entity7 has been classified as a @entity153 .			1

@entity243 would have been similar to a nuclear warhead detonating
experts say it would wipe out an entire city
@entity7 is travelling at 31,000 miles per hour or 50,400 kilometers per hour
