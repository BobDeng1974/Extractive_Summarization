by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor and @entity3 @entity5 deputy speaker @entity4 told @entity6 on thursday evening that @entity7 gov. @entity7 is ' not believable , ' and claimed a staffer who pleaded the @entity9 during a ' @entity11 ' hearing represents ' just the tip of the cover - up			1
' @entity7 , said the lawmaker leading the probe into @entity17 's most improbable scandal since the last @entity17 governor was caught up in one of the largest bankruptcies in @entity2 history , is either ' a governor who ca n’t manage his staff or one who is n’t telling the truth			1
' in an exclusive interview with @entity6 , the @entity27 assemblyman said he was unimpressed with the governor 's claim that he first learned wednesday morning about a political payback plot involving his most trusted staffers and traffic entering the @entity34			1
' it strains credibility , ' he said , ' that a governor who is as hands - on as he is would suddenly have a senior member of his administration go rogue like this			1
' @entity4 chaired an unusual public hearing thursday afternoon in the state 's capital city of @entity46 , which saw a former @entity7 transportation appointee invoke his @entity9 right against self - incrimination by refusing to answer questions			1
that one - time official , @entity50 , was implicated in a plot to snarl traffic in @entity53 , @entity17 in retaliation for the refusal of the town 's mayor , @entity56 , to endorse @entity7 's 2013 re-election bid			1
' @entity50 deserves an ass - kicking , ' he exclaimed			2
' sorry , there , i said it			0
' @entity50 resigned his post with the @entity90 @entity17 @entity89 in december			1
in a raft of emails and text messages published by news outlets on wednesday , he appeared to be orchestrating the plan along with @entity7 deputy chief of staff @entity74 and top @entity69 political consultant @entity97			1
a day later @entity7 dismissed @entity97 , his former campaign manager , who earlier in the week seemed destined lead the state 's @entity69			1
@entity97 also lost a lucrative consulting deal with the @entity100 , which @entity7 leads			2
the @entity17 governor also fired @entity74			2
' i terminated her employment because she lied to me , ' @entity7 said			0
' i am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team			0
' @entity4 seemed to roll his eyes through the phone as he spoke to @entity6			2
' this is the takeaway , ' he explained : ' @entity7 ca n’t be trusted to run the @entity34			1
he certainly ca n’t be trusted to run a country			1
' a long - time @entity17 political operative told @entity6 that @entity74 first worked with @entity97 , and was apprenticed to him , during @entity7 's re-election campaign			1
she took orders directly from him , said the insider , who requested anonymity , making her the tie between the @entity7 administration and the state 's @entity69 political machine			1
@entity122 : @entity7 's staff listen sullenly to his press conference hours after he fired a trusted co-worker betrayed : @entity74 , @entity7 said , lied when she was asked whether there was any truth in rumors the bridge closures were arranged contempt : @entity131 faces the cameras before taking the @entity9 at a state assembly hearing into the scandal what me ? @entity7 emerges from a personal meeting with the @entity53 mayor where he apologized to him @entity97 's job , the source said , ' was to keep the governor 's fingerprints off of things , ' and @entity74 's ' was to put plans into action			1
' ' if she pulled the trigger on all of this , it was on @entity97 's urging			2
' @entity4 , who chairs the @entity5 's transportation committee , subpoenaed thousands of pages of records from @entity50 , who refused to answer questions thursday			1
he predicted that his committee ' will be issuing subpoenas for @entity159 , for mr. @entity97 , and probably for others as well			0
' ' we ’ve never had a hearing where someone took the @entity9 so much , ' @entity4 said of @entity50 's turn on the hot seat			1
' i mean , some of the questions were just about figuring out who a text message was from , or who it was sent to			0
that 's hardly the kind of thing that creates legal liability for anyone			0
' ' @entity50 is just the tip of the cover - up , ' he claimed , referring to @entity7 administration officials ' early explanation for the september traffic backups as part of a study aimed at determining how many toll booths were needed in @entity53			1
' it ’s very clear when you look at the documents that he among others engaged in enormous efforts to come up with a cover story for all of it , and to delay responses to mayor @entity56 about what was happening			0
' nothing on me : @entity7 departs his press conference after insisting he knew nothing and telling a reporter who asked him if he had considered resigning : ' that 's a crazy question ' fall woman : friends of @entity74 told @entity6 that they believe she was deliberately made the ' scapegoat ' ' sad ' : @entity7 said he was disappointed in his staff 's actions , but claimed it was a measure of leadership to act ruthlessly when you discover something had gone wrong to support his theory that a cover - up likely reaches the top of the state 's executive branch , he cited past hearings where @entity7 administration officials canceled their testimony at the last minute			1
' we 've had state officials tell us shortly before they were scheduled to testify in committee meetings that the governor 's office told them not to participate			2
that happens with this governor , ' @entity4 recalled			2
' so we know from our own experience as legislators that this governor reaches into his departments , tells commissioners what to do , what they can say			0
and now he expects us to believe that @entity74 closed down three lanes leading to the @entity34 on her own without his input ? it ’s just not believable			2
' @entity7 said thurdsay that he was ' heartbroken , ' ' blindsided , ' and ' embarrassed and humiliated ' as the story broke			0
' i had no knowledge or involvement in this issue , in its planning or its execution , ' he said during his lengthy press briefing			0
' while there ’s no direct documentary evidence that he ’s lying , ' he said , ' it strains credibility			0
' @entity53 , @entity17 , mayor @entity56 ( r ) said former @entity7 aide @entity50 ' needs and ass - kicking ' bottleneck : the ambulance took nine minutes to reach mrs @entity255 as traffic backed up to cross the double - deck @entity34 which spans the @entity258 between @entity90 and @entity53 , @entity17 @entity259 , a @entity17 @entity27 member of @entity260 whose district includes @entity53 , agreed in an interview with the @entity263 that @entity74 was likely following an order to orchestrate the bridge traffic shutdown			1
' i do n't know who the person is that gave the ultimate order , ' said @entity259			0
' this did not , the young lady did not just wake up one morning – when you see the emails – she did n't just wake up one morning and decide " let 's screw up the traffic in @entity53			2
' " @entity6 spoke with a childhood friend of @entity74 , who lamented her ' bad day at work			1
' ' it 's a disgrace what 's happening that she 's the only one with egg on her face , ' she said of the now - former @entity7 administration official			1
' i believe this story is much more multifaceted than just @entity74			0
my friend has been scapegoated			0
' @entity74 kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to @entity89 official @entity50 on august 13 , subpoenaed documents show @entity17 assemblywoman @entity292 ( r ) said criminal charges could be coming in the @entity7 ' bridgegate ' scandal @entity4 also found unconvincing @entity7 's claim during his thursday morning press conference that his team had no motive to target @entity56 for revenge			1
the mayor , @entity7 told reporters , ' was never mentioned to me as somebody whose endorsement we were even pursuing			0
... so part of this is , i never saw this as political retribution because i did n't think he did anything to us			0
' but @entity4 said there was ' clearly a political motive ' in the bridge shenanigans			2
' i ’ve been told by people that there were political emissaries from the governor who did ask the mayor for an endorsement , ' he told @entity6 , ' and he demurred			1
' and @entity53 is an important @entity27 stronghold , he added , with other political comings and goings beyond the gubernatorial race			0
' @entity324 was an important spot for county races and statewide legislative races			0
this might have been about on of them , ' he speculated			0
@entity7 met with @entity56 in @entity53 for 45 minutes on thursday afternoon , offering the apology that he promised during his morning press event and later calling it ' a very warm and productive meeting between me and the mayor			0
' asked what he said , @entity7 added : ' i apologized			0
that ’s what i came here to do			0
' texts between two @entity7 aides depict a callous attitude toward the traffic chaos they caused , including a swipe at children of voters who supported @entity7 's gubernatorial candidate , @entity348 not - so - @entity349 : when three toll lanes originating in @entity53 were suddenly forced to merge into one in september , traffic snarled for a week until authorities in @entity90 reversed the @entity17 officials ' order @entity56 accepted the apology and added that his ' biggest concern is that we make sure that this never , ever , ever happens again in the future			1
' ' we were unconditionally provided with that assurance , ' the mayor said			0
assemblyman @entity4 said his committee staff would begin releasing the full collections of subpoenaed documents – ' somewhere between 3000 and 5000 pages ' – on friday morning , beginning with the material provided by @entity50			2
@entity69 leaders at the national level watched the drama unfold with an eye toward the 2016 race , with the governor 's supporters keenly aware that his performance will determine whether he is considered presidential material			2
@entity7 is set to be inaugurated for a second term as governor on january 21			0

@entity381 deputy speaker @entity4 said @entity7 is either ' a governor who ca n’t manage his staff or one who is n’t telling the truth '
he trashed the governor 's *presumed* presidential *aspirations* , saying he ca n't even be trusted to run the @entity34
it 's *inconceivable* , he insisted , that a ' hands - on ' leader like @entity7 might ' suddenly have a senior member of his administration go rogue '
a long - time @entity17 political operative said thursday that @entity7 political aide @entity97 was likely the shot - caller behind the bridge scandal
the insider added that @entity7 's deputy chief of staff , @entity74 , was loyal to @entity97 and may have taken orders from him
@entity74 's childhood friend told @entity6 that she was ' scapegoated ' and called it ' a disgrace ... that she 's the only one with egg on her face '
@entity89 appointee @entity50 refused to answer questions during a state assembly hearing , exercising his @entity9 right
