tucked away in one of northern @entity2 's pristine mountain canyons is an old log cabin that was the birthplace not of a famous person , but a top - secret mission that forever changed the world			1
@entity11 , along with a nearby small and stark building where the second person died while developing the nuclear bomb , are among a number of structures scattered in and around the modern day @entity15 that are being proposed as sites for a new national park commemorating the @entity18			1
it 's an odd place for a national park , many admit			1
besides the fact that some of the sites are behind the gates to what is supposed to be one of the most secure research facilities in the world , nuclear critics have called the plan an expensive glorification of an ugly chapter in history			1
national park : the quonset hut , where the atomic bomb that was dropped on @entity38 was assembled , is to be opened to the public as part of the new park at @entity42 , @entity2 historical : one of the places to be turned into a national park at the @entity15 is the ' gun site ' , where the bomb that was dropped on @entity48 was assembled ‘ it is a debasement of the national parks idea , ’ anti-nuclear watchdog @entity50 co-founder @entity49 said when the @entity51 two years ago recommended creating national parks at @entity42 ; @entity55 , @entity56 ; and @entity57 , @entity58			1
he remains opposed to the plan , saying it will not provide a comprehensive picture of the @entity18 , and he notes that extensive interpretative museums concerning development of the nuclear bomb already exist			2
supporters , however , note that good or bad , the @entity18 transformed history			0
and they argue that key sites that have not already been bulldozed should be preserved and the public should be allowed to visit them			2
‘ it is n't glorifying anything , ’ says @entity71 , historical facilities manager for @entity42 labs			0
‘ it 's really more a commemoration ... history is what it is			0
we ca n't pick and choose what 's historically significant			0
’ ' danger ' : technicians are seen working at @entity15 in the 40s and 50s powerful : the fireball of the @entity85 blast is seen here on july 16 , 1945			1
visitors to the park will learn all about @entity90 's history of nuclear weapons the park service , she said , would help people learn about the controversies , the people and the social , political and military legacy surrounding the development of nuclear weapons			1
‘ there are a lot of emotions rolled up in this story , ’ she said			0
‘ that 's why the park service is the best entity to tell this story			2
they can approach it as an outsider			0
they have no real interest in how it is told			0
they can tell it from a national perspective			0
’ among the proposed park 's biggest supporters are lab workers like @entity71			2
she has been working since an act was passed in 2004 to study creation of such parks , to help identify and preserve areas in town and within lab property to include			0
potential park properties include some buildings in downtown @entity42 , a town that was essentially created to support the lab , as well as 17 buildings in six ‘ industrial sites ’ within the lab 's fence			1
' a lot of emotion ' : visitors will learn about how @entity135 and general @entity136 ( center ) examined all that remains of a hundred - foot tower , winch and shack that held the @entity85 nuclear weapon much to learn : the mushroom cloud of the @entity85 test in @entity2 , which will be part of the learning experience for visitors to the new park they include the v - site , where the first atomic bomb to be detonated at the @entity85 was assembled , as well as the areas where the @entity153 and @entity154 nuclear bombs that were dropped on @entity155 , respectively , were assembled			1
also on the list is the @entity158 site , which includes @entity159 and the @entity160			0
@entity11 had been part of a boys ' school and dude ranch that was purchased and taken over to create @entity42 lab. it was turned into a key plutonium research office after the first so - called ‘ criticality accident ’ killed physicist @entity168 , prompting officials to move research to the cabin in a more remote area			0
a few hundred yards away is the @entity160 , where @entity173 was killed after a slipped screwdriver accidentally began a fission reaction , making him the second casualty of the @entity18			0
deaths : the @entity42 site will have the areas where two physicists were killed during their nuclear bomb research - @entity168 , right , and @entity173 , left in the works : a scientist inspects the cyclotron machine at @entity42 in the 50s			2
legislation to create the parks at the nation 's nuclear sites passed the @entity190 and a @entity192 committee earlier this year ' @entity194 history ' : a tree stands amid rubble and the shells of buildings after the atomic blast that destroyed @entity48 on august 6 , 1945 @entity18 : the city was built for the purpose of the nuclear bomb			1
if the proposal is signed into law , the parks would be limited to areas involved in the @entity18 that created the first nuclear weapons legislation to create the parks at the nation 's nuclear sites passed the @entity190 and one @entity192 committee earlier this year			1
if it is passed and signed into law , the parks would be limited to areas involved in the @entity18 that created the first nuclear weapons			1
but @entity71 has also been busy researching and documenting other now closed areas of the lab. for example , during a 70th anniversary commemoration this summer , lab officials took a media tour and workers and their families on tours of what until recently had been secret tunnel where the nation 's nuclear stockpile was stored after @entity228 ‘ it 's a fascinating process and really exciting from a historian 's point of view , ’ @entity71 said			2
‘ it 's a weird hometown history			0

sites at the @entity15 in @entity2 are being proposed for a national park
critics say it 's an ' expensive glorification ' of an ugly historic time
*organisers* say it would help people learn about the controversies and legacy surrounding the development of nuclear weapons
@entity248 will include site where first atomic bomb to be detonated at the @entity85 was assembled , and where the @entity48 bombs were assembled
