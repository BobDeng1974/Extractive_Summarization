by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:25 est , 7 february 2014 vice president @entity3 has now said that there is no reason for him not to run for president except for the fact that he likes driving his own car			1
' there may be reasons why i do n't run , but there 's no obvious reason for me why i think i should not run , ' @entity3 told @entity14			1
@entity3 has been plagued by questions about whether or not he will be running for president a third time in 2016 , and he has stuck to his standing line about how has not yet decided			1
no reason not to : vice president @entity3 said that he needs to see the field and see if he is the only person that would fight for middle class values and a sound foreign policy ' for me the decision to run or not run is going to be determined by me as to whether i am the best qualified person to focus on the two things i 've spent my whole life on : giving ordinary people a fighting chance to make it and a sound foreign policy that 's based on rational interests of the @entity33 where we not only are known for the power of our military but the power of our example , ' he said			1
@entity3 , who is 71 and will be 73 at the time of the next election , previously said that he and his wife , dr @entity41 , had not had a formal conversation about 2016 and this time he took a different tact in answering the same question			2
' after i ran the first time , she did n't want me to run again			0
the second time , she came to me and said you 've got ta run			0
the reason she wanted me to run was because she was convinced if i ran we 'd end the war in @entity52 and have a sounder foreign policy and she was convinced if i ran i would work like hell to make sure the middle class got a fighting chance , ' @entity3 told @entity14 on thursday			1
' i think the future for this country - i know people think i 'm too optimistic , but it is incredible and there is so much just within our grasp			0
' addressing the issue : @entity3 gave himself the deadline of ' a year this summer ' to figure out if he will run he said that his best bet on a deadline for the decision would be that he will have a verdict by ' realistically , a year this summer ' which would give him just over a year to launch a formal campaign			2
' does n't mean i 'm the only guy who can do it , but no one else i think can , and i think i can then i 'll run			0
if i do n't i wo n't			0
' the obvious other competitor that he will - or wo n't - be facing is @entity77			2
the former secretary of state is also mulling her decision about 2016 , but her polling numbers and formal fundraising operation are significantly more suggestive of a run			0
the bevy of recent polls matching the various @entity86 candidates up with one likely @entity87 all use @entity88 as that figure , and the most recent take on the possible @entity91 primary line up - done by @entity92 on january 31 - has @entity3 with 9 per cent of the vote as compared to @entity88 's 64 per cent .			1

vice president has not ruled out running for the *top* spot in 2016 , which would be his third try for the presidency
said that he needs to see if the @entity91 candidates are fighting for the middle class and ' sound ' foreign policy
*current* polls have @entity77 winning the @entity91 primary in a *landslide* , with 64 per cent of the vote to @entity3 's 9 per cent
