by @entity0 published : 11:52 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 25 october 2012 the parents of a little girl who suffered more than 100 fits a day were repeatedly told there was wrong with her , they have claimed			1
@entity5 , known as @entity6 to her family , suffered from @entity8 , a form of autism which leads to epileptic fits			1
but it took two years to get a diagnosis , with the toddler instead being diagnosed with a learning difficulty - and her fits being blamed on this			1
@entity5 suffered from @entity8 , a form of autism that leads to epileptic fits her mother @entity21 , 36 , claims doctors said the seizures were quite common and accused her of ' being neurotic '			1
she said : ' @entity6 went from being a happy healthy toddler , to one who could n't speak , walk or talk			0
' it felt like it all happened overnight			0
' she was just 22 - months - old at the time and before that she suffered no other symptoms			0
eventually she started to have seizures and on one occasion she had 100 fits in 24 hours			2
' mrs @entity5 , a foster mother , and her husband @entity35 , 41 , not only had to face caring for their sick daughter , they also had to battle with medics who refused to believe @entity6 was seriously ill. @entity5 ( second left ) with her sisters ( from left to right ) @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , days before she died in 2008 @entity5 's family are now fundraising to try and find a cure for the devastating condition			1
her parents @entity21 and @entity35 say it took two years for their daughter to be diagnosed ' she would just scream instead of speaking , ' recalled mrs @entity5			1
doctors at the local @entity51 in @entity52 diagnosed her with a learning disability			1
‘ but i knew this was n't the case , ' she said			0
she claims the doctors continued to disregard the seizures of a sign of anything serious , saying they were common in children with a learning disability			1
‘ one doctor accused me of being neurotic			1
’ finally , at the age of four , @entity6 was referred to a neurologist , who immediately diagnosed @entity8			1
‘ at the time there was n't a great deal of information about the illness , despite it being fairly common in girls , ’ said mrs @entity5			1
‘ but we were told it was life - limiting and @entity6 had a severe form of the condition			2
@entity5 's parents were told their daughter 's fits - which sometimes totalled 100 a day - were due to her suffering a learning disability			1
they say they were accused by doctors of being ' neurotic ' she continued : ‘ it was a big shock			1
to have a healthy child who you are then told has a life threatening illness is devastating			0
‘ we complained but we did n't get an apology from @entity85 for not diagnosing it			0
it was down to knowledge - they had n't come across it before			0
if we went there now - they would spot it			0
' @entity6 died in 2008 aged nine after contracting a virus			2
mrs @entity5 is now crusading to raise awareness of the condition and fundraising to find a cure			2
' now i am determined to raise awareness of the condition and money for the @entity101 , which is looking at finding a cure			0
' i hope that no one will ever have to suffer the way we did with @entity6			0
it is soul destroying and the only reason @entity35 and i have managed to move forward is because we have three beautiful girls and our faith			0
