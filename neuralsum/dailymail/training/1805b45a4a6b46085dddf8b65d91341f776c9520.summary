with the setting sun just beginning to turn the sky pink , a killer whale leaps out of the ocean and soars into the air , spray cascading down in its wake			0
it is a magnificent image			0
except the whale ’s dive has a purpose – the dolphin quivering 15ft below			2
these astonishing photographs record the final act of a chase that lasted two hours , and ended with the dolphin trapped in the jaws of the eight - ton orca			1
the dolphin was originally part of a small group swimming off the @entity22 coast but the others managed to get away , leaving it at the mercy of a whole pod of whales			1
dramatic : this killer whale was pictured attacking a bottlenose dolphin off the @entity22 coast astonishing : these photographs record the final act of a chase that lasted two hours photographer @entity33 , who captured the extraordinary scene , said : ‘ the killer whales tore round at full speed for two hours			1
‘ we never knew where to look because they erupted out of the water in one place , disappeared in a thrashing of foam and reappeared in a totally new location			0
‘ on one occasion the killer whale burst out of the water directly in front of us , and about six or seven metres ahead			0
' he was about four metres in the air and heading right at us - i thought he was going to land on the boat but it turned mid-air and clattered into the sea beside us			2
’ fortunate : photographer @entity33 captured the extraordinary scene hunting : the killer whales raced around after the dolphin at full speed for two hours the father - of - one , who has been whale watching for more than two decades , said the killer whale in the photograph appeared to do most of the chasing			1
mr @entity33 added : ‘ the terror and fight for life of the dolphin was palpable			2
one felt one could feel the adrenalin in his veins and his pulsing heart as he raced for his life			0
‘ [ he went ] back and forth but [ was ] always met by another whale blocking the way			0
sometimes , three or four times , the whales would knock the dolphin out of the water - once with their tail			1
gruesome : as darkness fell , the whales had the dolphin on the surface and it was all over ‘ incredible when you consider that this was a large healthy dolphin			1
it is staggering how the whales treated it like a plaything			0
‘ i had the feeling - maybe wrongly of course - the last hour was unnecessary as far as the whales were concerned and that they were just playing with it and then finally , just as darkness fell , they had it on the surface in their midst and it was all over			2
