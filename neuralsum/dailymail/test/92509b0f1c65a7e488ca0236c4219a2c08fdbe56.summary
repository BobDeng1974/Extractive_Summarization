@entity1 chairman @entity0 has dismissed rugby ’s salary caps rules as ‘ a farce ’ in financial documents seen by @entity6 that show his club ’s wage bill soared by another £ 1million last season alone — even as they remain the subject of a salary cap investigation			1
a fortnight after the shock departure of chief executive @entity16 and three months since the revelation that the north @entity19 club are being investigated by @entity20 for alleged salary cap breaches , @entity6 can reveal @entity1 ’ mounting debt has topped £ 40m — the most in rugby history			1
the rising costs facing the club are also a concern , with the wage bill leaping more than 50 per cent in three years			2
@entity1 now owe £ 41.6m , according to new filings at @entity28 , much of it funded by an unsecured loan from long - standing benefactor @entity31 and a consortium of @entity35 business associates			2
@entity1 chairman @entity0 has dismissed rugby ’s salary caps rules as ‘ a farce ’ the employee wage bill ballooned to £ 9.1m last year and , with @entity31 admitting further losses lie ahead , there are growing concerns about the club ’s financial health			1
a move by @entity1 last december to scrap the salary cap — which is currently £ 5m but was £ 4.5m in the period covered by the new figures — drew no public support from other @entity50 clubs			1
with discussions ongoing over the viability of ring - fencing the top flight , or at least restricting promotion and relegation , @entity31 has restated that the salary cap must be scrapped			2
‘ we need to change the farce whereby we are all operating under different rules , ’ wrote @entity0 in a chairman ’s statement in the club ’s annual accounts seen by @entity6			1
‘ we have one wage cap , the @entity66 provinces have no wage cap , the @entity70 clubs a wage cap twice ours , all of which makes no sense whatsoever			2
it needs to be changed			0
‘ in financial terms , it was another difficult year [ 2013 - 14 ]			0
having been involved in professional rugby now for 20 years , i ’m constantly amazed how hard it is to break into people ’s culture			0
documents show his club ’s wage bill soared by another £ 1million last season alone despite investigation ‘ the big cities have that soccer culture but built over 100 years			1
@entity91 [ the purchase of ] is a vast step forward and gives us a permanent home but we still have much to do			0
we could , of course , cut costs very considerably — for example a top @entity70 club has a medical staff of three , far smaller than ours			0
but we really do n’t see how you can aspire to be one of the best club sides in @entity104 if you do n’t have a fantastic support system for the players			0
’ the club have lost on average just over £ 5m per year over the past four years , more than doubling its debt burden in that period			2
annual accounts for 2013 - 14 show the club ’s parent company carry no legal obligation to service the debt , meaning they could technically walk away at any time and leave the club insolvent			1
of most interest to their @entity50 rivals will be the dramatic hike in salaries paid to employees , which rose from just over £ 8.1m to more than £ 9.1m last year the @entity6 can reveal @entity1 ’ mounting debt has topped £ 40m — the most in rugby history the club took on 24 new staff in that time , nine of them players and coaches , but with the salary cap set at just £ 4.5m last season — not allowing for one ‘ marquee player ’ who theoretically could earn an unlimited salary but in reality will not get more than £ 500,000 — questions persist over the club ’s salary structure			1
even allowing for the unlikely scenario of a £ 1m budget for coaching staff , that would leave more than £ 3m in staff costs for 54 administrative staff — an average salary of more than £ 55,000			0
a premier @entity20 spokesman said : ‘ @entity1 have recently moved into a new purpose - built stadium , @entity91 — which is a huge asset to the local community — with a number of new staff added			0
‘ the club are in an investment phase and , given the strength of the shareholding base , this is something they can manage			0
