will @entity0 win the @entity1 ? @entity2 moved into the scenic splendour of @entity4 , the path to its spiritual home at the great @entity7 paved with the irony of an invasion force of some 25,000 @entity10 marching there via the swirling pavements of the @entity13			1
this @entity1 is now the party nobody wants to miss. from the dark forebodings of socio - political strife a football phoenix has arisen , in all its multi-coloured plumage			1
the most opening matches without any kind of draw – let alone a bore – since before the war			0
even the first high - technology goal award			2
thus the challenge of keeping the @entity39 faith fell to this country ’s most envious of sporting neighbours			0
to break the spell would be criminal			0
for @entity21 to do so in this part of the world where the game is a religion would be sacrilege			1
those hybrids of @entity23 were also asked to play their part – and did so to increasingly heightened @entity10 tension - but the weight of expectation was on all the blue - and - white striped shoulders , not only those hunched in the household name of @entity0			1
welcome to the party : @entity0 announces himself on the @entity1 stage with his goal master at work : @entity0 watches his shot hit the post and go into the goal @entity21 , two - time winners , are a @entity1 power with a coven of stars and that stature brings with it responsibilities			1
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 even in defeat , @entity74 in the teeth of cynical intimidation from @entity77 , had already met that standard			0
they had started football back down the road to what it always should be – the opiate of the masses no matter how down - trodden they may be			2
here , if only for a few short weeks , is escapism from the poverty and inequality of the @entity90 mind the quantifying of the cost , feed on the spectacle			0
the first game here came as an important staging post in this project			0
this , 28 days later , is where it will all come to a climax			0
belief : there were 25,000 @entity21 fans in the @entity7 to watch their side win party trick : @entity21 's @entity107 shows off his skills in the game @entity21 are among those with the most serious aspirations of making that return date			1
part of that desire is rooted in the rivalry with @entity69 which is among the most passionate in the football world			0
nothing could be sweeter for @entity0 and his men to meet and beat the host nation in that final			1
but first they had to deal with these eight - syllable @entity122 and although they had so many of their countrymen here encouraging them that proved challenging in the extreme			0
a mixture of @entity23 ’s readiness to take the fight to them and tell - tale signs of that familiar @entity10 arrogance answered the call to provide more thrills and spills – but did nothing to suggest that we were in the presence of potential world champions			1
making their mark : @entity23 's @entity142 scores through the legs of @entity21 's @entity144 so overwhelming was @entity21 ’s occupation of @entity69 ’s famous stadium that we might have been in @entity148			1
at the start the men from the @entity150 seemed awestruck by the huge atmosphere and @entity152 , still a teenager until next week ’s birthday , presented @entity21 with that @entity156 gift of a third minute own goal			1
strangely , though , that mishap settled the @entity23 to their now uphill task			2
@entity21 , meanwhile , were slack and unco - ordinated in possession and distracted at the back			2
the under - dogs – less star - power , superior organisation – frequently gave the second favourites kittens			0
great expectations : @entity10 football fans watch their side win @entity0 , for whom this is supposed to be his optimum @entity1 , was as nervous as any of them , in brutal truth he was having something close to a nightmare for more than an hour			1
then he found the magic with a typical jinking run and classic low shot in off a post and all was forgiven			0
well , for the moment at least			0
there are yet sterner tests awaiting in the knock - out phases but the fits induced by the @entity23 will nag at the @entity0 men as they move on			1
and although he is a more stable and humble personage than @entity188 , some of that @entity191 arrogance still runs as undercurrent through @entity21 ’s psyche			2
they were complacent after the early present , even though they were often in all sorts of trouble			0
then the ego which had been in danger of crash - landing took flight again as soon as @entity0 put them two up			2
the late @entity23 goal which brought on more panic for the final five minutes should be a lesson but do they never learn ? @entity0 ‘ s solo had saved the three points , as well as sparing the tournament its first draw going into its fifth day			1
but it will take more than this if @entity21 are going to win their third @entity1 – and if he is ever to ranked up there in the pantheon of all - time greats with @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 --- and , of course , @entity188			1
still it has to be acknowledged that they honoured the spirit of what is now undeniably the greatest show on earth			0
even though a second goal against them would have wrought havoc with their campaign they spurned all thought of playing keep - ball in the dying minutes , going all - out and reckless for a third of their own			2
no do n’t stop the carnival .			0

@entity21 arrive at the party that the whole world wants to be at
@entity0 scores the second goal as the @entity241 beat @entity23 2 - 1
@entity21 hope to return to the @entity7 on july 13 for @entity1 final
