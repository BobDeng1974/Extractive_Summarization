by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 15 march 2013 a shadow has fallen over @entity3 , battle lines have been drawn and a daunting quest to protect the good names of @entity6 and the @entity7 of the @entity8 is currently underway			0
but it is n't the dark forces of @entity11 or the fiery breath of @entity13 the dragon that threatens the peace of @entity17 's mystical land , but the hideous spectre of @entity19 branded fruit machines			2
the @entity17 estate , which is fiercely protective of the late author 's work , is up in arms following the appearance of the gambling machines in @entity28 casinos			1
wrangle : the estate of @entity17 author of ' @entity31 ' and ' @entity19 ' @entity32 is locked in a legal battle with @entity34 , makers of @entity19 and the @entity31 films over gambling machines threat : the @entity17 estate is unhappy about the appearance of @entity19 - themed gambling machines in @entity28 casinos they claim the use of @entity17 's characters to promote gambling is a clear breach of contract and that it damages the good name of @entity17 and the reputation of the books			1
last year just days before the @entity51 , they sued @entity34 , in @entity52 and @entity54 owner of @entity55 ( @entity56 ) which owns worldwide rights to @entity58 and the @entity19 for at least $ 80million ( £ 53million ) over alleged exploitative merchandising			1
prized : the @entity17 estate is fiercely protective of the late author 's work the lawsuit claims the production of @entity17 based gambling games ' has outraged @entity17 's devoted fan base , causing irreparable harm to @entity17 's legacy and reputation and the valuable goodwill generated by his works			1
' @entity17 's family contends their merchandising agreement with @entity74 extends only to tangible products such as figurines and clothing and not to electronic rights			2
but now @entity34 have counter sued claiming they have lost out on millions of dollars of revenue as a result of the @entity17 estate preventing from using the characters to the extent they might have wished			1
but the @entity86 's legal team say this amounts to bullying and that they intend to dismiss @entity34 's counterclaims			1
their @entity91 attorney , @entity90 , said : ' the defendants ’ amended counterclaims are nothing more than an effort to sue the @entity97 and @entity98 for suing them			0
' they are entirely without merit and are a classic example of studio “ bullying tactics			2
” ' the @entity97 and @entity98 filed this lawsuit in order to force @entity34 and @entity54 to live within the boundaries of the contract to which they agreed			2
' @entity34 ’ and @entity54 ’s amended counterclaims are simply an attempt to punish the @entity111 and @entity98 for having the nerve to stand up to the studios and tell them that they ca n’t take more rights than were granted to them by contract			0
@entity119 : the first part of the @entity121 has reportedly already grossed $ 1bn ' luckily , the law protects people like the @entity111 and @entity98 from these kinds of intimidation tactics			0
' the adaption of the @entity17 's novels to the big screen has proved an impressive money - spinner for the @entity131 studio			1
@entity19 film trilogy , directed by @entity133 , earned an estimated $ 6 billion from movie tickets , dvds and merchandise			0
money : the @entity17 estate was seeking $ 80 million from @entity34 , its @entity139 subsidiary and producer @entity54 ( pictured ) and the adaption of @entity17 's first @entity3 book @entity31 appears to be set for equally impressive results with the first of that trilogy already pulling in an estimated $ 1billion			1
film fans and critics have accused @entity34 of being greedy by stretching the @entity31 , which as a book is roughly half the size of a single @entity19 volume , into three films			0
it is not the first time @entity34 have become caught up in legal proceedings with the @entity17 estate			1
@entity17 's heirs settled a lawsuit over the ' @entity19 ' movies for an undisclosed amount in 2009 , allowing production to proceed on ' @entity31 '			0
that lawsuit against @entity139 claimed @entity17 's trust received only an upfront payment of $ 62,500 for the three movies before production began but was due 7.5 per cent of the gross receipts			2
and last year none other than @entity6 actor sir @entity165 had to step in after @entity56 demanded a @entity167 pub called the @entity31 changed its name			0
after sir @entity165 accused @entity56 of ' unnecessary pettiness ' , the company offered the bar a nominal licensing fee to settle the row			0
@entity34 has been unavailable for comment .			0
