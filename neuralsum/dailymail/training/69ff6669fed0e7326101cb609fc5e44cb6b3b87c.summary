by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 17:25 est , 23 february 2013 horrified : composer and @entity2 presenter @entity0 says finding out a handful of music teachers had abused their position of trust with students was a ' bitter blow ' for those of us who have been fighting hard to sustain funding for music education it came as a particularly bitter blow to find that a handful of teachers had regularly abused their position of trust with young and vulnerable students			1
some of the stories that have emerged are horrific and reveal systematic and serial sexual abuse that has tarnished , even wrecked , young lives			1
the schools and colleges at the centre of recent scandals have in fact produced players of exceptional talent - and still do - so let ’s not throw the baby out with the bath water			2
you rarely work with an orchestra or ensemble these days without seeing players trained at @entity35 , @entity36 or the @entity37 and it must be said that the majority of the staff are dedicated and gifted teachers			2
for them , however , it is essential that these institutions now give parents and students the confidence that not only their musical disciplines are in good order but also the conduct of all of their staff			1
that is why a group of distinguished musicians and the @entity55 , @entity56 , have demanded that there be a full inquiry into how the abuse at @entity35 was able to happen			1
when a gifted and leading pianist like @entity62 says that teacher / pupil abuse was widespread in his day at @entity35 but that no one was prepared to risk their prospects by speaking out it becomes obvious that the pernicious culture of ‘ cover up rather than face up ’ exists not only in institutions like the @entity69 but also in music education			1
i am reliably informed that , as with @entity73 , more widespread abuse will soon come to light			1
the gravity of the problem and its repercussions was all too vividly demonstrated in the tragic case of @entity79 , a @entity80 pupil who , following her testimony and cross-examination in the trial of music teacher , @entity85 , committed suicide			1
it is essential to grasp how , in music tuition in particular , opportunities for errant teachers arise			0
tragic : the gravity of the problem and its repercussions was all too vividly demonstrated in the case of @entity79 who committed suicide following her testimony and cross-examination in the trial of music teacher @entity85 let us imagine a young girl ( though it could easily be a boy ) whose life revolves around making music , who practises for many hours a day to such an extent that music is her entire life			1
at its centre is the charismatic teacher who can do all the things she aspires to , who can show her that the angle of her bowing arm needs adjusting , who plays duets with her and in so doing gets into an intimate exchange of ideas and nuance			0
he explains that to make music she must listen to his every phrase and answer it with a corresponding one of her own			1
very soon the language is verging on the sensuous and flirtatious in much the same way that young dancers can not but practice the physical intimacy of their craft			0
the fact that music transcends words is part of its magic – nothing speaks more powerfully than the music itself			0
indeed , on private passions , the programme i present every sunday on @entity2 , well - known people talk about the music that is important to them and , whether they are discussing @entity142 , @entity143 or @entity144 , are frequently reduced to tears and often use the word ‘ orgasmic ’ because this wonderful art form takes us so deeply inside ourselves			0
probe : children 's commissioner @entity56 , left , has demanded that there be a full inquiry into the abuse at prestigious @entity35 , while pianist @entity62 , right , says that it was widespread while he was there if we can lay bare our soul in simply listening to music , imagine the emotions involved in actually playing it			1
our young violinist , then , still hardly formed as a person , is confronting profound feelings in the presence of a teacher who has begun to take on a guru - like importance in her life			0
these are precisely the conditions that have been described by some of the victims			0
when the teacher oversteps the boundaries , “ imagine you are playing this naked ” was one such remark , begins to touch the pupil in a way that is clearly moving into the realms of the improper and suggests meeting for a drink , the girl is confused			1
this is her teacher , after all , the person she trusts and admires			0
probe : the prestigious @entity35 in @entity181 , where @entity182 was abused by teacher @entity85 that is when guilt begins to kick in – ‘ it must somehow be my fault and while part of me dislikes it part of me is excited by it therefore i must be complicit			1
’ the stage is now horribly set			0
the recent case of the abused girls in @entity194 is worth recalling because even without the heady mix of making music these kids , who were met at the school gates by their groomers , somehow felt that they should repay in kind the goodies , the cigarettes , the alcohol that had been lavished on them and made them feel that they were living a more sophisticated life than their largely impoverished 14 years had previously seen			2
‘ we just thought it was the price we had to pay , ’ one of them said when describing how she was abused , indeed raped , by not just one but a whole group of now convicted men			2
guilty : former musical director of @entity35 @entity85 and his ex-wife @entity215 , right , sexually assaulted former student @entity182 as with the adolescent and gyrating girls who streamed into the @entity219 studio fuelled by a rush of intoxicating music and a glimpse of their pop heroes plus celebrities like @entity73 , the promise of being grown up , of mixing with the famous , opens children to predatory adults			1
it need not be like this : i worked as a young treble with my @entity233 , @entity234 , and though he clearly felt more at ease with children , boys in particular , and though much of his work is obsessed with the theme of the corruption of innocence he never showed anything but completely acceptable affection towards me and my colleagues			0
however , we were in such awe of him and his gifts , i can well imagine the confusion we would have felt had he sought to take advantage of our hero worship			0
guilt is the predominant psychological driving force that makes life an ongoing misery for young victims of abuse			2
it ’s almost as though the abuser transfers his or her guilt to the victim because in most of these cases there seems little remorse when people like @entity85 are brought to justice			0
curiously , these are similar to the emotions described by survivors of the holocaust			0
it is not simply the guilt of surviving where so many others did not but that victims of violence and abuse feel permanently tainted , soiled by the darkness that they have been exposed to			2
one of the reasons that the @entity37 has been brought into the fray is that despite the then distinguished @entity284 , @entity285 , warning the principal that the person he was considering appointing as @entity288 , @entity289 , had a bad reputation as a result of his behaviour when teaching at @entity35 , the @entity37 still saw fit to go ahead with the appointment			0
@entity289 has now left his post but , reading the correspondence , it is worrying is that when someone as highly respected as @entity285 blew the whistle pretty loudly , and was backed up by others , he still met with deaf ears meaning that young lives might have been put at risk			0
this is unacceptable - an inquiry needs to examine vetting and consider security and vigilance , maybe closed circuit television , so that the good name of our music schools and the safety of their students are protected			1
under surveillance : @entity0 believes that closed circuit television could be key to protecting music school students			2

musicians and minister have demanded there be a full inquiry into abuse
problem was ' widespread ' but students would not speak out
@entity326 comes after abused former pupil @entity182 committed suicide
@entity329 could be answer to keeping students safe
