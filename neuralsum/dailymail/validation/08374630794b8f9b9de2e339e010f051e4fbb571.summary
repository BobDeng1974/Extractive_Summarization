' i could n’t believe it , ' said @entity77 , who is 18 weeks pregnant			0
' from the outside , the hotel looked presentable but the accommodation clearly had n’t been cleaned before we arrived			2
' there was a rip to the bed and a load of tin cans stuffed inside			2
it was bad but i never expected to find a meat cleaver			2
' we were moving a single bed against a wall so the kids , who were topping and tailing , would n’t fall out in their sleep , and they spotted it			2
we were meant to stay for two nights but we told them the next morning we were leaving			0
on the way out , i told a lady working there about the the cleaver			2
' now we ’re back in the smoke - damaged house , despite the fact the fire service told us it was n’t safe for me to be there while i ’m pregnant			1
@entity44 , manager of the @entity11 in @entity12 ( pictured ) , refutes the claims - and has accused the family of damaging a bed , which they deny mr @entity8 , who took a photograph of the cleaver on his mobile phone , said he believes it was left by a previous guest			1
speaking of the moment his son found the knife he said : ' he had his hand underneath the bed and he pulled something shiny out			1
' i picked it up and realised it was a massive meat cleaver			2
' i was absolutely horrified			0
if i had n't have seen him with it he could have done himself some serious harm			0

miss @entity7 , 38 , and her family were moved into the temporary accommodation after the fire , thought to have been sparked by a faulty tumble dryer , tore through their rented house in @entity55 ' i find it insulting as all i 'm trying to do is put a roof over my kids ' heads			1
' mr @entity44 also refutes the family 's claim that the room was untidy and said the cleaver was not spotted during his staff ’s prior checks			1
' i have had a word with my cleaners and they say no one complained that day , ' mr @entity44 said			0

' the council was only made aware of the meat cleaver find once the family had left the accommodation , after one night and returned to their home			1
our @entity199 are looking into this matter as the safety and comfort of tenants who are unfortunate to have to be placed in emergency accommodation are of paramount importance			0
