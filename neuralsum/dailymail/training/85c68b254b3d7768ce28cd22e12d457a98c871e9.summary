@entity5 's @entity4 , by @entity2 ’s young @entity1 star and author @entity3 , will be published next month to celebrate @entity4 ’s hosting of the @entity7			1
the book offers an insight into both the country and @entity5 ’s development from humble beginnings into one of @entity4 ’s shining lights as they try to win football ’s greatest prize on home soil			1
sales of the book will help @entity20 , a project in @entity22 helping homeless children and teenagers in the city ’s favelas			1
life was very different there compared to the centre of the city			1
there are drugs , crime and the threat of violence everywhere but @entity32 was a calmer , more relaxed place and the problems were n’t anything like the poorer neighbourhoods of @entity22			1
it was a good place to be a boy who liked football			2
@entity32 was safe enough to go off and play on my own in the park			2
i could be out there all day , every day			2
perfect ! i learned how to play football as a kid through trial and error , playing every day in the street or in the park			2
when you start kicking a ball about in @entity4 , there are no tactics			1
whoever can dribble the ball and score just does it			2
and that ’s what i learned to do			2
i played futsal ( small - sided indoor football ) right up until i turned professional at 16			2
i think @entity1 football has reached the level it has because of futsal			2
you have to be faster in everything you do ; particularly , you have to make quick decisions			2
blue boy : @entity2 's @entity5 is looking forward to the prospect of playing in the @entity7 in his home country @entity81 success : @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 celebrate lifting the 2002 @entity7 after beating @entity85 if you ’re dribbling , you have to do it by controlling the ball in a much smaller area			1
if you ’re shooting , you must be much more accurate because the goal - the target - is smaller			2
a lot of @entity1 players are self - taught like me			2
my first coaching did n’t come from a club but a local escolinha , a soccer school run by the municipality so you did n’t have to pay			2
there was one near to where i lived next to a little local pitch			2
by the time i joined my first club , @entity22 , i had already developed my style of play			1
@entity22 was an hour away from where i grew up			1
it is a fantastic city , with everything you could want ; restaurants , shops , things to see and do			2
it ’s a very busy city			2
everyone else in @entity4 says people from @entity114 are just on the beach all day , every day			1
@entity117 , they say , just work all the time ; people from the south are bad - tempered			2
we all get stereotyped ! at @entity22 they said i was going to be like a new @entity124			1
i was supposed to do all the things @entity124 had done with the club			0
i wanted to say : ‘ no , i ’m just me			0
’ when i joined @entity127 in 2010 , i moved to @entity128			0
because it ’s down in the south , @entity128 has a very different culture			0
the people , the gauchos , have their own way of doing things , their own way of life			0
there ’s a calmer attitude and i enjoyed that ; it ’s a more tranquil place than @entity22			1
comparisons : at @entity22 , @entity5 was expected to be the new @entity124 when first coming through the ranks they do n’t even drink coffee like everywhere else in @entity4 , but something called chimarrao , a tea made with the mate herb			1
they also take football very seriously down there , and maybe that ’s why the city has produced so many coaches and managers , including @entity153 ( the 1994 @entity7 - winning captain ) and @entity155 ( the current @entity4 manager who guided the country to their 2002 @entity7 triumph )			1
i ’ve been playing in @entity159 , with @entity2 , for two years now			0
for the many overseas @entity1 players like me , it will make a @entity7 back home even more special			0
i know what it feels like to play in front of a @entity1 crowd			0
it ’s important to recognise our responsibilities and take them seriously as players - but not to let the pressure inhibit us			0
special way of life : the south of @entity4 have produced coaches like @entity153 ( left ) and @entity155 ( right ) when the whistle blows for kick - off , we have to make sure we let the joy in our football come through			1
we have to be true to our ideals and not let the scale of the event stop us playing the way we all want			0
if we do that , we know we ’ll have 200million @entity1 on our side , cheering us on			0
it ’s an incredible thing that @entity4 have won @entity187 everywhere but never at home because of the game they call @entity192 , the 1950 defeat ( in the final ) against @entity194			1
i understand the effect it had on the @entity1 people			0
it just makes this year that much more important			0
my first strong memory of watching football was @entity4 at the @entity7 in 1998			1
i remember us getting to the final and losing to @entity203			0
we were all watching together with family and friends , because i was young i was right at the front near the screen and burst into tears at the end			0
with lots of other people all over the country , i guess			0
the most famous @entity4 team were the 1970 side			1
it had great players - @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 - but also a kind of togetherness			0
look at the fourth goal in the final against @entity224 ( regarded by many as the best goal ever scored )			0
from one end of the field to the other ; pass after pass after pass			0
and @entity232 , the right - back , is the one who scores			0
that kind of goal is only possible where there ’s a very special bond in the team			0
@entity4 legends : @entity217 ( left ) was a member of @entity4 's iconic 1970 side with @entity216 icons : @entity232 poses with @entity245 captain @entity244 prior to @entity4 's 1 - 0 group stage win in 1970 we realise that we ’ll only be as good as past generations of @entity4 teams if we are able to win as past generations did ; from @entity216 to @entity251 and @entity83			1
@entity4 is known for carnival			1
anywhere you go during a @entity7 , wherever there is a space and a big screen showing the game , people will flock together for it			0
everyone in @entity4 has a mix of blood in their background			1
i ’m mixed up all the way back through my family - i ’m a mongrel ! in that way , i ’m just a typical ‘ @entity1 ’ and my family have been @entity1 as far back as we can go , back to the @entity269 , probably			0
people have come from all over the world to live in @entity4 and they have brought their own religions with them			1
most people are @entity274 or @entity275 but we also have @entity277 religions , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , jewish people , @entity283 @entity274 - everybody has brought their own faith			0
together : @entity5 is unsure whether the players or the supporters will be more excited hosting the @entity7 that diversity is important in @entity1 football , too			1
look at the teams who have won the @entity7 since 1958 ; there is the same mix of people from every ancestry as you see on the street			0
we ’re proud that you can walk down the road and see people who are blond - haired , blue - eyed , olive - skinned , @entity269 or @entity301			0
maybe it is why @entity1 have this reputation for being happy ; everyone is welcome here			0
we do have big divisions in @entity4 but those are to do with social background			1
i understand those divisions because i come from a humble family although now i ’m more comfortable			0
i ’ve experienced it from both sides ; our divisions are about rich and poor			0
there is no stigma attached to the colour of anyone ’s skin in @entity4			1
as you grow up as a young footballer , you dream about playing for a big club or maybe in @entity321			0
but the first dream and the one that lasts is to play for @entity4			1
our first game is against @entity325 with the whole country looking on			0
i do n’t know who is going to be the most excited : the players or the fans			0
everyone will be together , feeling the same ; big emotions , excitement , euphoria , pride and , we hope , joy			0
@entity4 have won the @entity7 more times than any other nation			1
here ’s how they did it ... 1958 - @entity4 5 - 2 @entity339 ( @entity340 , @entity341 ) @entity216 arrived on the world stage at the age of 17 , rewriting history by becoming the youngest player to score in a @entity7 final and win a @entity7 winner ’s medal			1
1962 - @entity4 3 – 1 @entity349 ( @entity350 , @entity351 ) @entity352 ( ‘ the @entity353 ’ ) showcased his magical dribbling skills to become the star of the tournament after @entity216 was injured in the second group match			1
1970 - @entity4 4 – 1 @entity224 @entity358 ( @entity359 , @entity360 ) two former world champions met in a final for the first time and @entity1 captain @entity232 scored arguably the greatest goal ever , bursting through from defence to finish off an attack of sheer brilliance orchestrated by @entity216			1
1994 - @entity4 0 – 0 @entity224 ( @entity4 won 3 – 2 on penalties ) @entity370 ( @entity371 , @entity372 ) the first @entity7 final to be decided by a penalty shoot - out and @entity4 dedicated their win to the late formula one world champion @entity377 , who had died in an accident at that year ’s @entity380			1
2002 - @entity4 2 – 0 @entity381 ( @entity382 , @entity301 ) @entity83 scored both goals to exorcise the ghosts of 1998 , when @entity4 lost 3 - 0 to hosts @entity203 .			1

@entity5 and author @entity3 have produced a book that offers an insight into @entity4 and the *playmaker* 's development
sales of the book will help a project in @entity22 helping homeless children
