president @entity0 presented a rose - colored version of congressional history to a liberal - leaning online audience on monday , as he claimed that he was the most productive president since @entity4 until @entity5 got in the way			1
asked by the news website @entity8 if he had a prescription for the political polarization of @entity11 since his arrival in 2009 , he blamed the @entity13			1
' you know , ' he said , ' my first two years in office when i had a @entity18 majority and @entity20 and @entity21 , we were as productive as any time since @entity22			1
' ' and when the majority went away , stuff got blocked			0
' @entity38 passed , and @entity0 signed , a whopping 383 new laws in 2009 - 2010 , and voters responded by sweeping @entity5 into power in the @entity20 with 63 new seats and shrinking @entity53 ' majority in the @entity21			1
the tea party was alive and well , and the @entity0 presidency never again had an easy road on @entity57			0
major initiatives like @entity0 's $ 787 billion stimulus spending bill , the much - derided ' cash for @entity61 ' car buy - back scheme and a law that put all student loan borrowing under @entity11 's control felt like @entity18 wins in 2010 , but have since lost their luster			1
so has the @entity67 , @entity0 's signature achievement and the law that will define his legacy for good or for ill. bits of the @entity73 banking reform law have been chipped away since its birth in 2010			1
and @entity53 took credit for ending the @entity78 war and withdrawing 100,000 troops back to the safety of the @entity37 in that same year			0
but with the benefit of hindsight , @entity0 's critics have hammered him for failing to leave a residual military force behind – a force that might have prevented the rapid and rapacious growth of the @entity88 terror army in cities once secured by @entity37 ' blood			2
' @entity38 and the administration simply failed to listen to the @entity37 people , " said @entity92 rep. @entity91 at the time			2
' time and time again they yelled " stop , " but the folks running @entity11 barreled ahead with a job - killing agenda our nation did n't want or need			0
' laws passed during those two years would fill more than 4,050 pages of new federal code			0
@entity91 became speaker of the house two weeks later and has n't relinquished his hold on power since			0
the count of new laws passed in @entity91 's first two years as speakers – that is , @entity0 's third and fourth in office – ratcheted down to 286 as senate majority leader @entity112 began throwing up roadblocks to the upstart @entity13 on the other side of the @entity115			1
two years further down the road , in the @entity38 that concluded in december 2014 , just 86 federal bills were signed into law			2
@entity0 suggested in his @entity8 interview , which was conducted last month , that @entity5 have stymied his agenda and slowed down the march of progress			1
@entity122 : house speaker @entity91 got emotional in january 2011 as outgoing speaker @entity123 passed him his ceremonial gavel after a tea party wave that swept 63 new @entity5 to power the final insult : @entity13 sen. @entity129 now runs the @entity21 , leaving @entity53 without any moorings in @entity38 during president @entity0 's final two years in office @entity112 , however , bears much of the responsibility			1
in 2013 and 2014 , a flood of @entity20 bills turned into a trickle in the @entity21 as he ran the upper chamber of @entity38 with an iron fist			1
by october 2014 , @entity91 's @entity20 had passed as many as 387 bills that would never see a @entity21 vote , most of them with votes from both @entity5 and @entity53			1
@entity0 told @entity8 that eliminating ' the routine use of the filibuster in the @entity21 ' would be a helpful development			1
that maneuver allows any single senator to object to a vote that would end debate on a subject and put a question to the floor for a final vote			0
under such an objection , a supermajority of 60 is needed to proceed			0
not since 1979 has either party held that many seats			0
the result is often gridlock and slow deliberation , followed by a flurry of intense legislating as the end of a two - years session approaches			0
' there 's nothing in the @entity167 that requires it , ' @entity0 said			2
' the framers were pretty good about designing a @entity20 , a @entity21 , two years versus six - year terms , every state getting two senators			2
there were a whole bunch of things in there to assure that a majority did n't just run rampant			0
' ' the filibuster in this modern age probably just torques it too far in the direction of a majority party not being able to govern effectively and move forward its platform , ' he insisted			0
@entity185 @entity5 sen. @entity129 , the new majority leader , has taken a different approach from that of @entity112 , whom he displaced in january			0
' @entity188 ' : sen. @entity112 blocked hundreds of @entity20 bills in the last @entity38 and has been sidelined in the current session where @entity112 became @entity11 's chief individual obstructionist , @entity191 has opened up the legislative process to @entity53 ' amendments on every bill			1
it 's not out of the goodness of his heart , however : in 2016 @entity5 will have a tough time retianing control of the @entity21 since so many of the contested seats will be @entity13 - held , and in states where a @entity18 presidential nominee would expect to do well			1
by allowing his rank - and - file to vote in favor of liberals ' amendments now and again – as long as they do n't pass – he provides @entity5 senators with political cover that they 'll need next year in order to keep their seats			0
@entity191 , like @entity91 , wants to see @entity38 remain in the red column and elect a @entity5 president to work with them			2
and then he – or she – could later claim to have been the most productive president since @entity22 , at least until the pendulum swung back and ' stuff got blocked			2

president gave a wide - ranging interview last month to the website @entity8 , which held on to the *transcript* until monday
' my first two years in office *...* we were as productive as any time since @entity22 , ' @entity0 said
*democrats* ran both houses of @entity38 for @entity0 's first two years in office ; the @entity20 fell to the @entity13 in 2010 , and the @entity21 in 2014
as @entity5 *seized* the reins in the @entity20 , @entity53 began blocking bills and the rate trickled to one - quarter what it had been
much of what @entity38 passed in 2009 and 2010 has become intensely controversial : @entity33 , the stimulus , ' cars for @entity245 ' and others
