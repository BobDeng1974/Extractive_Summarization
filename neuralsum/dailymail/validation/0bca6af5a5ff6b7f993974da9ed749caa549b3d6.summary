labour leader @entity0 today launched another desperate bid to counter the rise of the @entity3 @entity0 left the door open to a post-election deal with the @entity3 yesterday as a new poll suggested @entity7 could be reduced to just two mps in @entity9			1
the @entity7 leader insisted his party could still win outright , pleading with people not to ' blow the whistle on the match before the game is over '			0
however he has not ruled out a vote - by - vote arrangement with the @entity17			0
on a visit to @entity9 he claimed there was an ' unholy alliance ' between the conservatives and the @entity3 to keep @entity22 in @entity23			2
he added that every seat @entity7 lost to the @entity3 would increase the chances of a second term for the @entity27			1
@entity7 's panic was increased yesterday by an @entity30 poll for the @entity31			2
it showed @entity34 's party way ahead , with 43 per cent of the vote , with @entity7 languishing on 27 per cent , the @entity21 on 14 per cent and the @entity36 on six per cent			1
on a uniform swing , the figures would see the @entity3 jump from just six of @entity9 's 59 seats in 2010 to 43 in may			1
@entity7 would lose 29 of the 41 seats won in 2010 , making it all but impossible for the party to win a majority			0
but a detailed analysis of the poll numbers suggests @entity7 's position could be even worse			1
a new poll puts @entity7 down to just 27 per cent , which professor @entity47 says could leave the party with just two mps , the same number as the @entity27 leading psephologist professor @entity47 , of @entity50 , said the @entity3 have advanced by a staggering 31 per cent in @entity7 seats			1
he concluded @entity7 could be wiped out in all but two seats			0
if so , the @entity3 would be certain of holding the balance of power at @entity54			0
' there is nothing ... to suggest that the rise of the @entity3 is not extending to supposedly safe @entity7 heartlands – if anything , the opposite is the case , ' said professor @entity47			2
mr @entity0 appeared angered by @entity63 positioning himself as kingmaker in @entity54			2
' it 's a combination of bluster and bluff , ' he said			0
' i 'll tell you who 's going to be writing a @entity7 budget , me and @entity72			0
it 's not going to be @entity63 – not in a million years			0
' former first minister @entity63 has vowed to hold @entity7 to ransom in the event of a hung parliament he had previously ruled out a coalition with the @entity3 , but stopped short of ruling out the vote - by - vote arrangement proposed by the @entity3			1
' how other parties decide to vote on the basis of a @entity81 is up to them , ' he said			0
@entity3 deputy leader @entity83 said mr @entity0 would be ' very , very foolish ' to rule out a post-election agreement , which would prevent the conservatives from gaining power			2
on the claim of an unholy alliance between the @entity27 and the @entity3 , he said : ' i think @entity0 has lost the plot entirely			1

new poll puts @entity3 on 43 ****%**** , @entity7 27 ****%**** , @entity27 14 ****%**** and @entity36 6 ****%****
analysis suggests @entity3 would take *53* out of 59 seats north of the border
@entity7 would be left with just two , the same number as the conservatives
@entity0 uses speech in @entity102 to *dismiss* @entity63 's *threats*
*ex-first* minister claimed @entity3 would hold @entity7 to ransom for *£* *180billion*
