by @entity1 reporter published : 10:46 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 12:01 est , 15 october 2013 passengers on @entity4 planes are finding themselves in a tighter squeeze as airlines install new slimline seats that take up less space from front to back , allowing for five or six more seats on each plane			2
the changes , covering some of the most common planes flown on domestic and international routes , give the airlines more paying passengers and a smaller fuel bill because the seats are slightly lighter - although that may be cancelled out by the extra passengers			0
some passengers seem to mind the tighter squeeze more than others			0
the new seats generally have thinner padding			1
and new layouts on some planes have made the aisles slightly narrower			0
uggh : frequent fliers say air cabins are tight enough already but @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity29 are now fitting slimmer seats to squeeze in more passengers whether the new seats are really closer together depends on how they are measured			1
by the usual standard , called ' pitch ' , the new ones are generally an inch closer together from front to back as measured at the armrest			1
airlines say passengers will not notice			0
the seats going onto @entity31 's 737s have thinner back magazine pockets			1
@entity29 will have slightly smaller tray tables			1
@entity30 's new seats put the magazine pocket above the tray table , getting it away from passengers ' knees			1
and seat - makers saved some space with lighter - weight frames and padding			0
this allows airlines to claim that passengers have as much above - the - knee ' personal space ' as they did before , even if the seats are slightly closer together below the knee			2
sittin ' pretty : the new seats are slimmer so they are being fitted closer together out with the old : the newly designed seats will mean an extra row of five or six passengers can be squeezed in at the back new seats going into @entity30 ' @entity68 are an inch closer from front to back			1
the new seats @entity31 has put on nearly its entire fleet are 31 inches apart , about an inch less than before			1
in both cases , the airlines were able to add an extra row of six seats to each plane			2
international passengers are feeling crowded , too			0
as recently as 2010 , most airlines buying @entity80 's big 777 opted for nine seats across			0
now it is 10 across on 70 per cent of newly - built 777s , @entity80 says			0
the extra seat has generally meant narrower aisles , and more knocks from the drinks trolley for those at the end of the row which is the biggest complaint from travellers according to @entity92 of @entity93			2
' we used to recommend the aisle seats , because you could stretch out more , ' he said			0
he now tells passengers who want to sleep ' to bring a jacket and prop up against the window '			0
@entity30 , @entity29 and @entity31 in the @entity4 are all buying into the slimmer , closer together seats option			1

@entity30 , @entity29 and @entity31 are all opting for more seats
they will cram in another row by fitting slimmer seats closer together
new seats generally have less padding and rows are an inch closer
