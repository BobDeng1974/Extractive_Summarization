after 40 years of fruitlessly wandering the fields - a metal detector from @entity2 hit it big by stumbling on one of the largest hordes of @entity6 coins , now believed to be worth £ 1 million			1
until that day @entity8 had only found a musket ball and had been moving from one field to the next when by ' pure fate ' his metal detector gave a signal			1
and when he dug down he found 5,200 silver coins wrapped in a lead sheet - which are now set to go on display before they are put up for sale			1
@entity8 discovered approximately 5,200 of these @entity6 silver pennies , worth £ 1million , in @entity20 late last year @entity8 , from @entity2 , was with his son @entity21 and friend @entity21 when he unearthed the hoard of ancient coins mr @entity8 , 59 , from @entity2 , added he normally would not normally have gone up to @entity25 , @entity20			1
the hoard contains coins from the time of @entity29 ( 978 - 1016 ) and @entity30 ( 1016 - 1035 ) and were believed have been buried at the end of @entity30 's reign			1
a small number of the coins were today on display at the @entity36 for the launch of a report which lists the discovery as the biggest of the nationwide treasure finds			1
the father - of - two was with his son @entity21 and friend @entity21 when he discovered the huge find while out on a dig with the @entity45 on december 21 last year			1
a modern @entity47 penny ( left ) is pictured beside one of the roughly 5,200 @entity6 coins unearthed he said : ' it was just a day 's metal detecting , but it was perhaps a little further than i wanted to travel , it was about a 120 miles or so drive			1
' on the day it just seemed like the thing that was going to happen			1
sometimes you have that feeling , it was so natural when it happened , i ca n't explain it			1
' i just had that feeling that the day was going to end well			1
' at the time it would not have been my choice to spend that kind of money to go all that way to find nothing , because that 's what generally happens			2
but i was talked round by my son and his friend @entity21			2
' just before the find , the trio had decided to leave the field they were in and move into another			2
while making their way they continued to use their equipment as they walked , but he found his friend 's metal detector affected his , and he moved over away from him and walked directly over it			1
he said : ' it was pure fate , and we drove all the way to the @entity87 which we would n't normally do , so you see what i mean i felt i was drawn to it			2
@entity8 said he had only found one musket ball in 40 years of using a metal detector before he discovered the stash of @entity6 coins ' after that i said to @entity21 i will always move over			1
' he added : ' it 's the first treasure i 've found , but that depends how you qualify as treasure			1
i have found things which i treasure , because they are interesting , but this is the first treasure			1
' the signal from the find was so large and so deep , that when i first uncovered the first coin i knew there was more than that one coin			2
when i picked it up i could see behind it and i knew there was more			2
' there so much speculation going round and someone suggested that each @entity30 coin is worth £ 250 and times that by 5,000 is more than £ 1million , but i just do n't know and i do n't want to speculate , i do n't want to get my hopes up			1
' i 've been doing this for 40 years			2
but there are n't many metal detectors that would describe themselves as treasure hunters , that 's not really why you do it			1
' discussing his emotions at the time , he said : ' i think people want me to say is that i jumped up and down and run round the field , but it did n't work that way			2
' it 's like you 've been doing the lottery for 30 years and you find one day you win , the first reaction is relief			2
it 's hard to describe			2
' i was like winning the pools , but not in the sense i was running around and dancing around			0
it was nice to know all that effort all paid off			0
i only found one musket ball before i found all those coins			1
' the coins are still being catalogued and examined by experts at the @entity36 , before the hoard goes to corners court where the coroner will decide whether it is treasure or not			1
it will then be valued by independent experts before they are sold to a museum			0
on what he would spend his share of the money on , mr @entity8 , he said : ' i have n't really thought about it			1
i do n't really know			0
' i have to say our family home is a bit small for family to visit , from @entity161 , so it would be nice to be able to put them up if they were to come to stay			0
' @entity30 ( pictured ) was @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 at the same time @entity169 became @entity170 of @entity166 at the age of seven following the murder of his half - brother @entity173 in 978 at @entity174 , @entity175 , by @entity173 's own supporters			0
given the nickname ' @entity178 ' or ' unready ' ( meaning ' no counsel ' , or that he was unwise ) , @entity169 failed to win or retain the allegiance of many of his subjects after the church transformed his brother into a ' royal martyr '			0
in 1002 , he ordered the massacre of all @entity187 in @entity166 to eliminate potential treachery			0
unable to soldier , @entity169 defended the country against increasingly rapacious @entity192 raids from the 980s onwards by diplomatic alliance with the duke of @entity196 in 991			0
in 1013 , @entity169 fled to @entity196 when the powerful @entity197 of @entity198 dispossessed him			0
@entity169 returned to rule after @entity200 's death in 1014 , but died in 1016			0
meanwhile , @entity30 , pictured right , also known as @entity30 , lived between 985 and 1035			0
although @entity198 he was @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 at the same time			0
@entity30 's claim to the throne of @entity166 was initially rejected by this country 's noblemen so he returned home			0
there he raised an army of more than 10,000 men and in 1016 launched an invasion force that sailed up the @entity211			0
according to legend he believed himself to be so powerful his command could hold back the tide			0
he tested this theory by having his throne placed on the shore where he vainly tried to command the tides back until he nearly drowned			0
however , some historians argue the demonstration was proof of his wisdom in showing courtiers he was not taken in by their flattery			0
after his death @entity30 was buried in the @entity225 at @entity226			0
during the @entity228 , his coffin was among those smashed by parliamentarian soldiers and his bones scattered			0
his bones remain at @entity232 but are intermingled with those of other deceased @entity166 kings .			0
