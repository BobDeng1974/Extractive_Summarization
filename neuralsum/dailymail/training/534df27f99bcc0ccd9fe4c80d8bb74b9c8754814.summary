the menacing advance of the @entity1 in @entity2 should not prejudice @entity4 people against @entity6 people and the @entity8 faith			1
i once served as an airman in @entity11 and @entity2 and can vouch for the kindness and goodness of many @entity6 people			1
indeed , more than three million have made their home in @entity17 , and by far the majority want to get on and make good and peaceful homes among us			1
but there is a darker side			2
radical @entity23 is on the rise and imperilling our way of life , threatening to undermine the values that have been bitterly won over the centuries			2
even worse , about 500 of these murderous thugs , criminals and rapists are said to be @entity17 and a further 1,500 from other parts of @entity49			1
the youngest of these would - be terrorists is reported to be 13 years old and has travelled to the @entity52 from @entity53 with an older brother			2
frighteningly , the young @entity17 hostage - taker who may have beheaded the incredibly brave reporter @entity56 , is not even the first to have committed such a despicable act			1
journalist @entity58 was murdered by a @entity59 as well			2
my good friend @entity60 , widely known as the ‘ @entity62 ’ , has seen many of his parishioners killed			2
he said only the other day that a child he had recently baptised was cut in half by terrorists in the advance of @entity69			2
he and other church leaders in @entity2 are witnessing the ethnic cleansing and even the genocide of the ancient @entity74 community in the homeland of our @entity74 faith			0
@entity74 in @entity2 dates back to the first century and the missionary expansion inspired by the preaching of @entity80			0
by contrast , @entity23 arrived by conquest and the sword centuries later			0
these young fanatical muslims from @entity17 and elsewhere are bringing the sword yet again to this region			1
only this time they are killing all in their wake , including fellow @entity88 who do not hold the same belligerent interpretation of @entity23 , together with @entity90 who by population are in a majority in @entity2			0
how can we respond to the evil these young people are doing in the region , including young @entity17 that we have educated in our schools and who now repudiate our decent and tolerant values by pursuing jihad in @entity2 and @entity101 ? the first step is to withdraw their passports			1
this includes young people who we learn are planning to travel to commit terrorist acts , together with those who are fighting for foreign terrorist groups			1
@entity109 journalist @entity56 was beheaded by an @entity44 militant they should not have access to the privilege of travelling under a @entity17 passport with the accompanying consular protection – and they certainly should not be able to travel back to their shores with the barbaric and bloodthirsty skills they have gained			1
young people who travel abroad to commit violent ‘ jihad ’ should know before they go that there is no way back to civilised society			2
it may focus their minds to know that the privileges and luxuries of our country ( including our gyms , games consoles and relative peacefulness ) will be denied to them in future			0
it will take a brave government to carry out this intent but it is my feeling that the majority of our fellow citizens want this to happen			0
they will want it out of sheer disgust that so - called @entity17 are killing others in the name of @entity23 and so challenging the tolerant values that stem from our @entity74 heritage			1
the second and most important step is to recover a confidence in our own nation ’s values			0
for too long we have been self - conscious and even ashamed about @entity17 identity			1
by embracing multiculturalism and the idea that every culture and belief is of equal value we have betrayed our own traditions of welcoming strangers to our shore			2
the strangers we welcome were attracted to our way of life and our democratic traditions			0
they were often escaping totalitarianism and religious persecution and wanted to come to a country where there was freedom of religion and separation of the powers of church , state and judiciary			0
they also came to one of the only countries in @entity49 where there was an established @entity187			0
the establishment of the @entity187 did n’t mean that other beliefs were not welcome but it did offer hospitality for a range of diverse beliefs			0
in @entity17 ’s hospitable establishment different beliefs were welcomed but only one was pre-eminent – @entity74			1
the fact is that for too long the doctrine of multiculturalism has led to immigrants establishing completely separate communities in our cities			1
this has led to honour killings , female genital circumcision and the establishment of sharia law in inner - city pockets throughout the @entity17			1
it is a situation that mainstream muslims – the vast and quiet majority – are fed up with			0
they are witnessing the radicalisation of some of their young people and feel powerless to do anything about it			2
the majority of @entity6 leaders firmly condemn such radicalisation , but the appeal of such illicit underground movements to radicalised young men can not be underestimated			1
the best way to challenge a thoroughly bad thing is to offer a better one			0
the better idea we can offer is the broad and all - encompassing values of liberal democracy in which we all have a voice and a say in shaping our future together			0
in this must involve the power and co-operation of @entity6 communities who need to state , more clearly than they have done so far , their denunciation of these fanatical forms of @entity23			1
@entity23 has many strengths to contribute to our land			0
when i was archbishop of canterbury i had a strong and rich friendship with sheikh @entity246 , who sadly died in 2003			0
he often remarked that @entity90 had difficulties living as minorities in plural societies and much more work had to be done by @entity6 scholars			1
with him i set up an important ‘ listening exercise ’ that eventually led to a @entity253			0
i was also closely involved with @entity254 in the establishment of @entity256 following the 9/11 attacks on the @entity258 in @entity259			2
there has been a huge investment in strengthening @entity6 , @entity74 and secular dialogue			1
@entity6 communities are being challenged as never before to discipline their young people or face the consequences that such radicalised young men will be banished from our shores			1
this year we are reminded by the commemoration of two world wars that the values of our democratic traditions are precious			0
our fathers and grandfathers – including many thousands of @entity90 from around the @entity275 – fought against totalitarianism for the survival of democratic virtues			0
the bloodthirsty advance of @entity69 is a reminder that totalitarianism is far from dead			0

@entity31 wants those involved in terrorism to lose their passports
and for @entity17 to embrace multiculturalism and treat all cultures equally
@entity6 communities are being *pressured* to discipline their young
