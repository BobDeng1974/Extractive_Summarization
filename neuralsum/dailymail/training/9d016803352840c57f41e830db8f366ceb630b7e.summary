' i 'd like to express my disappointment to the @entity29 membership , staff , volunteers and patrons that i will not be at the masters			1
disappointment : @entity2 will miss the masters because of back surgery - his back has become increasingly troublesome and the golfing legend spoke last month at the @entity49 about the agony he was going through ' it 's a week that 's very special to me , ' he said			1
' it also looks like i 'll be forced to miss several upcoming tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation and getting healthy			2
' the masters gets the highest television ratings of any golf tournament , and while @entity2 last won a green jacket in 2005 , he commands most of the attention			1
he won his first masters in 1997 when he set 20 records , from youngest masters champion ( 21 ) to his 12 - shot margin of victory			2

he said he had a microdiscectomy for the pinched nerve , performed by neurosurgeon @entity106			1

upsetting : @entity2 looks down during a news conference at the @entity114 in @entity115 , monday , march 24 , 2014 when discussing his ability to compete at this years masters tournament in @entity29 , @entity118 @entity119 : woods injured his achilles after playing from under the @entity123 tree at the 2011 masters operating through a small incision in the lower back , surgeons remove small disc fragments that are pressing against spinal nerves			1
recovery can take several weeks and doctors typically advise against bending and twisting the back until patients are completely healed ' this is frustrating , ' @entity2 said			1
' but it 's something my doctors advised me to do for my immediate and long - term health			2
' @entity2 said he hopes to return to golf this summer , though he could not say when			2
it 's possible he could at least start chipping and putting in three weeks			0
his website said @entity19 could have sustained more damage if he had continued to play			0
crocked : woods withdrew from the @entity144 in 2011 after nine holes , left and the @entity146 played through the pain barrier on his way to winning the @entity149 carted off : @entity19 is driven off the course after picking up a neck injury at the @entity144 in 2010 he will have to wait until the @entity153 — maybe longer — to resume his quest to reach @entity156 ' record 18 professional majors			0
woods won his 14th major at the @entity149 on a badly injured left leg that required season - ending surgery two days after his playoff win at @entity162			1
he has not won another major since then			0
@entity2 has 79 career wins on the @entity165 , three short of the record held by @entity167			2
he already was off to the worst start of his career			0
he missed a 54 - hole cut at @entity162 , where he was the defending champion			2

racking up the green : @entity2 won the masters in 2005 last triumph : @entity2 stands with runner - up @entity176 after winning the @entity149 in 2008 after a play - off at @entity162 nice fit : @entity2 adjusts the @entity6 green jacket in 2002 after his win at @entity29 silver service : @entity2 looks at the @entity184 trophy after his win in 2005 ' it 's tough right now , but i 'm absolutely optimistic about the future , ' @entity2 said			1
' there are a couple ( of ) records by two outstanding individuals and players that i hope one day to break			0
as i 've said many times , @entity167 and @entity156 reached their milestones over an entire career			0
i plan to have a lot of years left in mine			0
' the recovery time is listed as two to three months before that usually happens , which would clearly leave him in a race against time to be ready for the meat of the summer programe			0
then there ’s the @entity209 at @entity210 in september			0
to play in that , he would almost certainly need a wild card and while captain @entity214 would be happy to hand him one if he has fully recovered , would a man who has undergone such an operation really want to be on a course in the heat of competition for as many as 12 hours a day ? 1995 - withdraws from @entity149 on sixth hole of his second round after injuring left wrist playing out of heavy rough 2002 - had his second knee surgery to drain fluid around his left @entity228 and remove a number of cysts 2007 - ruptured his acl running on a golf course , however , plays through the pain for the season 2008 - @entity236 surgery on his left knee after the masters in april 2008 - wins @entity149 in june , despite being told he had two stress fractures in his left tibia 2010 - neck problems down his right side forces him to withdraw from the @entity144 2010 - reveals he had a cortisone shot to help ease ' lingering soreness ' in his @entity249 in december 2011 - sustains a minor sprain to his left achilles playing from under the @entity123 tree at the masters 2011 - withdrew from the @entity144 for the second consecutive year after @entity249 , knee and calf problems 2012 - driven off the course on the 12th hole of march 's final round of the @entity49 at @entity93 after more pain in his left @entity249 2014 - @entity220 from the @entity79 with back problems whatever happens , this is unquestionably another massive blow for @entity19 , who has been blighted by one injury after another in his thirties			1
the most serious came in 2008 , when he tore his anterior cruciate knee ligament and was out of action for eight months			0
he has also withdrawn from events owing to his achilles and a bad neck			0
in 2011 , he failed to tee it up at the @entity149 and the @entity153 because of an @entity249 complaint			0
it is all a far cry from 12 months ago when he returned to the top of the world rankings with an eighth career victory at @entity278 and third of the season			2
this was supposed to be the year when @entity2 got back on the majors trail after a drought stretching back almost six years			1
now the future looks more uncertain than ever			0
