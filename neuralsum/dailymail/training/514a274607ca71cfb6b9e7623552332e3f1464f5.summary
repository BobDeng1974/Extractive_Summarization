by @entity0 his brilliant pictures have already won him 11,000 followers and made him @entity5 's king of @entity6			1
so it 's hard to believe that @entity8 only turned 20 yesterday and is an entirely self - taught photographer who started uploading his pictures to the social media site in january 2013			1
his account is now away with eye - wateringly bright photographs of @entity14 , from stunning seascapes to brilliantly lit inner - city streets			2
the pictures have seen him lauded as one of @entity21 's top travel photographers to follow on @entity6			2
@entity8 captures the many attractions of @entity14 in vivid photographs posted on @entity6 : ' @entity24 ' in @entity25 ( officially known as @entity26 ) and the glowing interior of @entity28 in @entity29 a city centre church nestled in between towering office blocks in @entity32 ( left ) while this vertigo - inducing image ( right ) was taken from @entity35 the @entity32 man said @entity6 was an outlet for his photography			1
' it was always a passion since i was very young , and @entity6 started me off , ' he said			1
' i find a happiness when i can find something i like and find something that someone else likes and make people think differently about it			2
' everyone can see a waterfall but i take that extra step to show people a different angle from what we always see			0
' that ’s something i ’ve always wanted to do as a photographer			0
' the 20 - year - old also takes shots of street art , including graffiti in @entity32 ( left ) and @entity61 , @entity29 , which are eye - wateringly bright these shots were taken by setting steel wool on fire and spinning it			1
the photographer uses a slow shutter speed to capture the whorls of fire @entity8 does not like to be pigeon - holed as a landscape photographer but likes to keep his followers in suspense about what he posts			1
' i aim to post two photos a day , ' he said			2
' i do n’t like specialising in things , i like to keep my audience in surprise about when i post next			0
i like landscape , streetscapes and ocean photography , and i ’m slowly expanding into portrait photography			0
' but the followers did n't come flock easily to @entity85			2
' it was a slow start and it was shock to me to see numbers growing and growing every single day , ' he said			0

' i would just like to keep it as a passion , i do n’t want to lose that passion , ' he said			0
