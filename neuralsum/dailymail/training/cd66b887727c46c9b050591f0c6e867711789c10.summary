@entity0 makes headlines on and off the field and this week is no different			2
however , following a tough match at @entity5 , it was @entity6 and @entity7 who should be highlighted after poor conduct during @entity10 's clash with @entity11 on saturday			1
disappointingly , @entity6 fooled @entity0 with a clear dive when the @entity10 man went down without contact from @entity11 ’s @entity15 ; the blame for this must lie with @entity6 but @entity0 will be cross with himself for being conned			1
@entity6 appeared to con referee @entity0 with a dive during @entity10 's victory over @entity11 the @entity10 star goes to ground under the challenge of @entity11 captain @entity15 at @entity5 @entity10 ’s opening goal was clearly offside as @entity24 was in an offside position before @entity6 ’s shot was deflected to him			1
of course assistant referees are the judges of offside so again the @entity30 referee should escape blame			0
the melee which followed after @entity0 awarded a free kick for @entity35 ’s very strong challenge on @entity36 seemed to be down to the referee ’s uncharacteristic casual approach to the incident			2
it was clear that @entity11 ’s players were angry at the tackle and looked to get back at @entity35			0
usually , @entity0 would have diffused the situation but instead allowed players to confront one another			0
one could argue whether a red card could have been shown but replays showed both players going in with raised boots and so a yellow card for each player looked appropriate			0
@entity11 's @entity53 is dragged away from @entity35 by @entity10 defender @entity54 ( left ) fifteen minutes into a spiky second half , @entity56 ’s ‘ laissez faire ’ approach allowed the heat to rise again by failing to award @entity59 a free kick			1
the angry @entity10 man then chased back and chopped @entity36 down – a clear caution			0
before @entity0 could issue a card , @entity7 pushed @entity59 who responded by shoving him back			1
both players clearly pushed each other in the chest but embarrassingly @entity7 went down holding his face , simulating where contact had occurred			2
both men were fortunate to escape with yellow cards			0
at least @entity56 ended the game with some credit as an excellent advantage led to the home team ’s winning goal but this will not be a performance which he will list as one of his finest			0
@entity10 wideman @entity59 pushes @entity7 in the chest as the pair came to blows on saturday @entity11 defender @entity7 , depsite being pushed in the chest by @entity59 , puts his hand to his face @entity10 pair @entity86 and @entity87 seemingly make a mockery of @entity7 after the incident			1

@entity6 appeared to dive during @entity10 's win over @entity11
