" characters like @entity0 are looked at like family members			0
and there 's no hint at any sort of wrongdoing - the slave masters do nothing in the film that seems inappropriate			1
" at least the movie got one thing right : tomorrow is , indeed , another day ; @entity129 is finally offering a grittier , more honest view of slavery in films such as " @entity133 " and " @entity134			2

' ' for me , as a film , just looking at it cinematically , it is a masterpiece , ' said @entity19			0
' but politically ? ... if you were to do the film today , you would n't make the film nearly as romantic			0
you 'd make the film much grittier			0
and you could show , i think , in a balanced way , that some @entity55 slave owners were , perhaps , kind human beings , and some of them were brutal			0
' today @entity129 is finally offering a grittier , more honest view of slavery in films such as ' @entity133 ' and ' @entity134 ' and that 's precisely what director @entity187 did with this year 's best picture oscar - winner , ' 12 years a slave			1
