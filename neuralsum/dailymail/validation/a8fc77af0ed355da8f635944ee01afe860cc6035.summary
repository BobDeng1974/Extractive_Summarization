over the 18 years , 859 marriages ended in divorce , 32 per cent of the sample group			0
for 24 per cent of the couples , tragedy struck when one spouse died , and 44 per cent were still going strong by the time the study ended			1
but among the 965 couples in which the woman got sick , the rate of divorce was 6 per cent higher			2
