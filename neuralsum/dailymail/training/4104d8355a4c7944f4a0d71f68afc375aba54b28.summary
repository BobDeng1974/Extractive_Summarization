every state has films associated with it whether it be @entity3 in @entity4 or @entity5 in @entity6 and now a clever @entity7 has assembled a map of every state 's favorite native movies			1
by isolating movies set largely in each state then finding the most popular among them on @entity17 , @entity13 user @entity12 has created a visual representation of favorite flicks from sea to shining sea			1
the fascinating endeavor left many states branded with a feel good classic ( @entity26 got @entity27 ! ) , but others were n't as lucky ( sorry @entity29 , you get @entity30 )			0
some states also wound up matched with some unexpected films			0
while @entity10 's @entity33 is no surprise , the most popular film set in the state of @entity10 is the 2011 @entity38 film 50/50			2
which is your state 's ? @entity13 user @entity12 created this map of each state 's favorite film that takes place largely within its borders some of the states ' films were obvious			1
the gambling state of @entity4 ended up with @entity49 while @entity51 's most popular native flick is @entity52 contention : some films seemed obvious but made for contentious additions to the map			0
@entity58 , for instance , is listed as @entity60 's favorite movie , but commenters pointed out that only a small portion of the film takes place in the state other films ended up with unsavory , though classic , films representing them like @entity69 ( silence of the @entity71 ) and @entity72 ( in @entity73 )			0

@entity13 user @entity12 looked at movies associated with each state and created a map using the ones with the *highest* @entity17 rating
each state and the @entity10 has its own corresponding favorite film with some more surprising than others
