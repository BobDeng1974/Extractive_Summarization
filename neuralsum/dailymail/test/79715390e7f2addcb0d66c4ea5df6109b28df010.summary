according to two popular online measuring tools , no more than 44 per cent of her @entity3 fan base consists of real people who are active in using the social media platform			1
and at least 15 per cent – more than 544,000 – are completely fake			0
@entity10 , the oldest publicly available twitter - auditing tool , reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state 's followers are ' good ' ; 15 per cent are ' fake ' ; and 41 per cent are ' inactive , ' meaning that they never tweet or reply to any tweets			1

really ? @entity1 's @entity3 follower - count appears to be significantly inflated @entity59 : @entity25 boasts two - thirds of a million @entity55 ' likes , ' but more than 46,000 of them list ' @entity62 ' as their hometown @entity64 reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed @entity62 , @entity66 as their hometown , a larger number than any @entity28 city			1
that would represent more than 46,000 people			0
additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her @entity28 @entity55 fans are older than 55 , most of the @entity62 contingent is in the 18 - 34 age range			1
while @entity25 was @entity28 's top diplomat , her @entity78 was buying @entity55 ' likes , ' according to an @entity82 report from last year			2
' in 2013 , the @entity78 , which has more than 400,000 likes and was recently most popular in @entity85 , said it would stop buying @entity55 fans after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $ 630,000 to boost the numbers , ' the wire service reported			1
