@entity2 full - back @entity0 admitted last week that his @entity4 career effectively ended when he elected to remain at @entity5 following the club ’s descent into administration , liquidation and the @entity10			1
before being signed from @entity11 by then manager @entity12 for £ 1.5million in the summer of 2011 , he had made five appearances for his country			2
however , his residency in the lower leagues has seen the 27 - year - old make just three substitute appearances ( totalling a mere 53 minutes ) for the national team in the last four years			2
@entity0 claimed that , as he approaches what should be his peak years as a player , he has all but abandoned hope of forcing his way into @entity26 ’s starting 11			2
@entity2 goalkeeper @entity27 ( right ) joins @entity28 as they promote a new four - match ticket package @entity5 team - mate @entity27 could be forgiven for adopting a similar approach			1
the goalkeeper ’s only cap came against the @entity34 in 2010 , when he was playing for @entity35			1
his involvement with @entity4 squads , a regular occurrence during his time at @entity40 , ended when he joined @entity2 in 2013			1
however , the 28 - year - old , whose international prospects were further hindered by a shoulder injury sustained in august which ruled him out of action for seven months , is in no mood to close the door on his chances of representing his country just yet			1
there ’s also the small matter of @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 being ahead of him in the pecking order			1
but @entity27 insisted : ‘ i would never say it ’s over			1
i ’m desperate to play and be part of the squad			2
the goalkeeping situation is very strong and there are some great goalies there			2
‘ all i can do is keep playing well at club level and keep knocking on the door and , hopefully , the manager will take notice			1
’ of course , as a goalkeeper , @entity27 can afford to be more sanguine than outfield players			1
all things being equal , he should still be playing at a high level for another decade or so			1
that , however , does not mean he is n’t impatient for success			0
some former @entity2 players , including @entity76 , the 2003 treble - winning captain , have claimed that another season in the @entity78 may prove beneficial for the @entity5 club while the first - team squad is dismantled and rebuilt from scratch			1
@entity0 's @entity83 career is effectively over @entity27 does n’t see it that way and he wants last sunday ’s unexpected victory over play - off rivals @entity87 to be the starting point on the road to @entity2 returning to the top flight this year			1
‘ i can only speak for myself , and i want to be playing in the top league , ’ he said			2
‘ you ’ve got to be ambitious as a player and i want to play at the highest level i can with @entity2			1
‘ i ’m desperate to be back in the top league and i ’m sure everyone else associated with the club is as well			0
we know it ’s going to be hard but there ’s still a great chance we can do it			0
‘ we need to be playing well going into the play - offs so it really starts from now			2
we have to take some good form into them			0
we have nine games left in the league and we have to show we can do it on the pitch			0
’ new owner @entity110 would also appreciate promotion being achieved sooner rather than later			0
with shareholder @entity113 seemingly having a stranglehold on the bulk of the profits arising from the club ’s retail operation , the financially - challenged club need a fresh injection of cash			0
in the last few days the @entity122 consortium of @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 have donated £ 1.5million in order to pay this month ’s wages but season - ticket renewal money in may , ideally at increased @entity130 rates , is likely to be vital			0
@entity27 was speaking yesterday to publicise a new four - match ticket package for this season ’s remaining home games but the improved performance against @entity87 will have done as much to increase attendances at @entity5 for those fixtures			1
as far as the goalkeeper is concerned , however , there is more to come from @entity140 ’s side between now and the end of may			0
‘ yes , we ’ve set a high bar but , at the end of the day , we are playing for @entity2 so the bar should be set high , ’ he said			1
‘ we can handle that : we should be able to handle the pressure and i ’m sure we will			0
that performance has been in us all season and it was just a case of trying to bring it out of us			0
‘ i ’m sure we ’ll take confidence from it and we ’ll work hard on the training pitch to make sure we are ready for games			0
’ @entity27 credited @entity140 for the transformation in the atmosphere at @entity5			1
the former @entity159 manager has dispelled the gloom which surrounded the club during the dog days of @entity12 and @entity163			0
‘ i think it ’s just down to the enthusiasm the new manager has brought , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s brought a spark to training too			0
@entity27 played for @entity35 when he won his only @entity4 cap ‘ he was always a passionate player himself and he soon lets us know if we are doing things right in training			1
he ’s been great and he ’s brought a new lease of life to some players			0
‘ it ’s a good start for us but we know there will be tough times ahead so we need to just take each game as it comes and concentrate on getting three points in the next game			2
’ prices for a four - match value package start at £ 62 for adults , £ 50 concessions and £ 18 for juniors in the @entity187 subject to availability			0
to book a four - match ticket package fans can visit www.rangers.co.uk , the @entity191 or call 0871 702 1972			0

@entity27 has won just one cap for @entity4 , against the @entity34
@entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 are ahead of him
but he insists playing for @entity2 does *n't* mean his prospects are over
