' all young @entity2 off - spinners should be taught to bowl the doosra , ' said one of the rising stars of the domestic game			1
' i 've been working on mine with @entity9 and i 'm ready to bowl it in a match			1
' it is what came next in his wide - ranging interview with @entity16 earlier this month that was most fascinating			0
' i 've bowled it in front of a lot of people in the nets , including umpires , and 95 per cent of them think i can get away with it			2
' art attack : @entity9 cut swathes through the @entity28 batting for @entity29 this week when he said ' get away with it ' i was pretty certain he meant 95 per cent of those people thought the delivery was legal but the terminology is indicative of attitudes towards what is , to @entity2 players at least , mystery spin			1
soon after @entity9 , the best practitioner of the art , had cut swathes through the @entity28 batting for @entity29 this week , @entity38 posted a picture on @entity44 of him bowling with the caption : ' you are allowed 15 degrees of flex in your delivery			1
' @entity50 , one of the more straight - talking members of the @entity53 team , joined in the virtual conversation by tweeting : ' this has to be a fake photo ? ' and then added : ' bowlers can bowl very differently in a lab while being tested compared to needing wickets in the middle			0
' delivery mystery : @entity38 and @entity50 reopened the debate over @entity9 @entity9 was not pleased and @entity63 have asked the @entity64 for clarification of @entity50 's comments			1
on wednesday it was revealed that @entity50 will be reminded about his responsibilities on social media but will not be disciplined by @entity53			0
the more important point is whether @entity53 should embrace the ' art ' , as @entity0 believes , or keep to our traditional view , seemingly endorsed by @entity38 and @entity50 , that there is something not quite right about unconventional spinners			1
there is still a strong feeling within the game that the doosra , when the ball turns away from the right - hander with an off - spinner 's action , can not be bowled legally			1
it was @entity86 , never afraid to start a debate , who questioned @entity9 's action during the @entity89 in the @entity90 two years ago when he destroyed the @entity53 batting			1
many within the @entity53 camp agreed but it was too sensitive to comment publicly , particularly as it would have looked like sour grapes			0
@entity97 , of course , are the kings of unorthodoxy and it was @entity101 who inspired the law change to allow 15 degrees of flexibility in a bowler 's elbow after he had been called for chucking by @entity108 umpires @entity109 and @entity110			2
time to deliver : rising star @entity0 is keen to bowl the doosra such was the backlash and acrimony then and with other mystery spinners that umpires will no longer call a bowler for throwing but are encouraged to report questionable actions			1
there are a few who will always raise suspicion , not least another @entity126 bowler causing mayhem , @entity119 , who bamboozled the @entity53 batting at @entity121 with four wickets gained with , shall we say , an unusual action			0
he , like @entity9 , has had his action cleared but that does not stop many raising their eyebrows when they watch him			1
@entity134 proved that conventional off - spin can still be effective and @entity53 's biggest problem is finding someone to replace him			2
if it is to be @entity0 , should @entity138 encourage him to bowl the doosra , or be suspicious that it could cause a whole heap of trouble ? it is a question that should be addressed before @entity0 attempts it in a match			1
@entity53 really do have to be certain he can ' get away with it ' before he tries it in a @entity89			0
final word there is no more intriguing situation in @entity2 cricket that that of who will keep wicket in the first test on june 12 should @entity151 , as is looking increasingly likely , fail to prove his fitness			0
two weeks ago i advocated a recall for @entity158 and support is growing for @entity28 's master craftsman			2
this was new @entity53 selector @entity162 on the subject this week : ' the keeper situation is massive , ' he said			0
focus : @entity158 ( left ) could be recalled for first test if @entity151 ca n't play ' there are two camps of keeper - there is the @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity174 group and there is the @entity158 , @entity173 , more of the old - school keeper			0
i watched @entity158 last week and he was terrific			0
there will be an interesting debate there			0
if you have a batsman who bowls spin in your side , like @entity0 or @entity184 , and an all - rounder like @entity187 or @entity188 , then your keeper could come in as low as eight			2
' that last comment is the biggest clue to @entity53 's thinking			2
they may well decide that the time is right again for @entity158 .			0
