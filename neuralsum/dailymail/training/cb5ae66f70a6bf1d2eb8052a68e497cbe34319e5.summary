this is despite the article stating : ' @entity31 restaurant owner @entity27 suggested [ the price difference ] was meant to be a secret among @entity53 customers			1
' ms @entity23 said the @entity54 would wait and see if there is further racist abuse from members of the public and if their business began to suffer before proceeding with legal action			1
' the difference between the prices is only for three items on the menu , and it is because of a printing error			0
the @entity2 menu had not been updated , ' she said			2
@entity68 ( above ) was one of three items in which the price on the @entity2 menu had not been updated			1
ms @entity27 said the restaurant has since updated their @entity2 menu to be exactly the same as the @entity18 menu ( right ) the boiled fish with pickled cabbage and chili is the same price in both @entity18 and @entity2 menus ( above ) the @entity2 version of the boiled fish with pickled cabbage and chili is the same price in the @entity2 and @entity18 menus ( above ) the @entity15 reported that the restaurant 's two menus - one written in @entity18 and one in @entity87 - had different prices despite listing the same dishes			1
but ms @entity27 told the @entity90 that this was only the case for three dishes the fried rice with lettuce and beef , the @entity68 and the dried spicy beans			0
those three dishes were ' different by $ 1 or $ 2 '			1

ms @entity27 said she was distraught at the claims her restaurant was ' racist ' , saying she had been open for 13 years and had a number of regulars both @entity2 and @entity12 backgrounds ' we have been open for 13 years , we can promise everything is the same			1
all customers , if they come in my restaurant , are welcome			0
' she said that she only offered discounts to a small number of regulars , both @entity2 and @entity12 , who she said visit the restaurant for a meal at least two or three times a week , adding that they received the same discount regardless of their background , race or the language they speak			0
the only difference in the menus is the variation of spiciness , particularly in sauces , which she said they decided to change after local customers complained .			0

@entity31 restaurant says the article claiming they charge more than 10 per extra for @entity12 *patrons* is *unfair* and *incorrect*
racist abuse has been directed towards the restaurant after it was revealed three items on the @entity18 menu were $ 1 or $ 2 higher
but the other *77* items on the @entity18 menu were priced exactly the same as on the @entity2 menu
owner @entity27 blamed a printed error for the price differences , which has now been fixed
she is considering legal action if the *bad* publicity drives customers away
