by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 07:17 est , 6 may 2013 a plot of land which was once a reservoir is set to be transformed into a @entity5 - style underground home and has gone on the market for £ 45,000			1
@entity7 granted planning permission for the quirky design last year which could pave the way for more subterranean studios			1
the revolutionary plans were given the go - ahead because they will cause little impact on the landscape around it			0
but to get into your new home you will have to climb down a hole in the field with the help of a ladder			2
cosy : estate agent @entity24 has been tasked with selling the unusual planned @entity5 - style home mr @entity26 , of @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , designed the studio			1
he said : '' if you were walking by , you would have no idea that there was a house underground			0
' it will look just like a field with a little hill in the middle			0
' we will have to dig further underground so there 's space for the kitchen but this is minimal and it will will not change the look of the landscape at all			0
' camouflaged : the design means the field will look exactly as it did when it was a working reservoir no need for a key : to get into the home the owner will have to lift up this lid and climb down into the hole ' there just was n't room to build a big house but it certainly makes it quirky and its size and shape means it resembles a @entity5 house			1
' mr @entity26 was approached by a private client , who bought the plot from the @entity66 at auction three years ago and was asked to design a property			1
' i could n't say no to such a great opportunity			0
this really is a one - off project and i jumped at the chance to design something on the land , ' he said			2
' it took around three months to design and it 's very compact but it has everything someone might need for a holiday let , including a kitchen and a toilet			2
' the application for planning permission was previously turned down four times because it 's such an unusual build but i think it was eventually accepted because it does n't change the landscape at all			2
' the studio , which is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible , will rely on the natural temperature of the earth to heat the home			1
not for the faint - hearted : if you are scared of heights this may not be the property for you @entity7 granted planning permission for the design last year and the plot is now on the market @entity98 , a renewable energy specialist at @entity100 , said : ' the studio will be heated by the @entity103 's natural temperature			1
' as it is underground , it will be very well insulated by the ground and there will be very little difference in temperature in the home between summer and winter			1
' the most we 'll need to install is a heat pump , which will extract heat from warm areas and recirculate it , but this might not be necessary			2
' there will be no windows , which will help to keep the heat in but a small tunnel connected to the ground above will transmit some natural light into the property			1
' the home will have electricity produced by solar panels or micro wind turbines			0
plans : this image shows the design for the @entity5 style studio in @entity29 clever idea : the revolutionary plans could pave the way for more @entity5 - style homes there will also be some form of running water and a toilet but it is still being decided how waste will be recycled			1
@entity24 , managing director at @entity140 in @entity28 , @entity29 , is now trying to sell the land , which is on the market at a guide price of £ 45,000 , and it is estimated the cost of building the project will be around £ 35,000			1
' it will be a very unusual property and we have had a lot of interest in it			0
since the plot went on the market six weeks ago , we have had around ten viewings of the reservoir and three offers on the land , but the offers have n't been quite high enough			1
' it has created a lot of local interest because it 's such a quirky project			0
' there is a strict clause in the planning permission which states that the plot has to be used as a holiday letting because the council is keen to attract tourism to the area			1
' i think people looking for a trip away will just love it and the surrounding countryside is perfect for people wanting a getaway			0
' the studio will be built on a plot of land which is surrounded by a field and rolling hills , so you ca n't get much more idyllic than that			2
' it 's so unusual and so we predict it will be in high demand			0
it 's like a quirky alternative to camping			0
' this means that it is a very lucrative investment for the right buyer			0
you could rent a property like this for more than £ 400 a week so you 'd get a great return			0
' we 're looking for someone who will come along and give it a go			0
