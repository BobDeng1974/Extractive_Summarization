defendants include the school , its board of trustees , president @entity43 and professor @entity44			0

email messages requesting comment from @entity43 and @entity44 were not immediately returned			0
in his lawsuit , @entity8 said a @entity2 - owned website had presented as fact that he sexually assaulted @entity7 , a senior majoring in visual arts			1
it said that the school allowed @entity7 to carry a mattress into classes , the library and campus - provided transportation as part of her senior thesis , that @entity44 approved the ' @entity70 ' for her course credit and that @entity7 's pledge to carry her mattress to graduation may prevent @entity8 and his parents , who 'd like to fly from @entity9 , from participating in graduation ceremonies			1
