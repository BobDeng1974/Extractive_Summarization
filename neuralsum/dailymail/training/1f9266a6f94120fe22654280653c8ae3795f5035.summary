by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 22 august 2013 scientists have bottled the @entity3 ’s most colourful light show , along with several auroras from other planets			1
the colours were created inside a glass dome known as a @entity8 where charged particles glow vividly when exposed to a magnetic field			1
this is similar process to that which creates the @entity14 and will help scientists better understand how different auroras are formed			1
@entity18 ( left ) and his summer intern @entity17 ( right ) built the @entity19 , which recreates @entity3 's @entity14 and the auroras from several other planets dr @entity18 and his intern @entity17 from @entity22 in @entity23 , built the @entity19 at the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26			1
‘ it recreates the atmosphere of the @entity3 at 80km in altitude when an aurora is occurring , ' said dr @entity18 , a research scientist at @entity24			1
' the aurora is created when particles , originally from the sun , precipitate into the atmosphere			2
' the @entity19 machine is a spinoff of an experiment from the 19th century called the @entity39			0
the @entity39 , created by @entity41 physicist @entity40 , first demonstrated the glowing result of electrically charged particles mixing with a magnetic field			1
the @entity19 recreates the atmosphere of the @entity3 at 80km in altitude when the @entity14 ( pictured ) are occuring from , 1896 to 1917 the @entity41 physicist @entity40 designed an experiment called the @entity39 , to better understand the formation of the polar lights			1
the experiment consisted of shooting electrons from a duct to a magnetised sphere in a vacuum			0
the electron gun represented the sun , and the magnetised sphere represented the @entity3			2
a century later , new designs of the experiment have branched out to simulate different interactions between different stars and their planets , hence the new name , ' @entity19 '			0
dr @entity18 and his team upgraded the old experiment by adding several spheres , which allowed them to recreate the auroral ovals that occur on @entity3 and several other planets			2
‘ for example , we can show the reaction when @entity72 , the satellite of @entity74 , sends particles to @entity74			0
we can also simulate the aurora at @entity77 and @entity78 , when their magnetic fields are directly pointing towards the sun , ’ said dr @entity18			2
there are around 10 other @entity19 machines in @entity84 , and the first was created by dr @entity18 ’s phd advisor , dr @entity85 , in @entity86			0
studying auroras and the relationship between the sun and the @entity3 is a key focus area of @entity24 ’s @entity91			0
the @entity19 machine will used for demonstrating how each variable interacts to create an aurora			0
the colour of the aurora in the bottle is purple because of the nitrogen used			0
the aurora on @entity3 is usually green due to reactions with oxygen in the atmosphere ‘ the @entity19 allows us to create analogies with existing processes , like the aurora at @entity107 , which do not have a global magnetic field , but several localised magnetic fields , or @entity78 and @entity77 , when the magnetic fields of those planets point towards the @entity112 , ’ explained dr @entity18			1
dr @entity18 warned that the experiment is only an illustration ; more complex phenomena are occurring in the magnetospheres of planets			0
for example , there are various gases on each planet that can create different colour effects within auroras			0
dr @entity18 is now planning on incorporating this variable using a few extra magnets and some carbon dioxide to simulate the aurora on @entity107 .			1

colours created when particles in a dome were exposed to a magnetic field
this is a similar process that leads to the @entity14 on @entity3
team are now using extra magnets and @entity139 to simulate the aurora on @entity107
