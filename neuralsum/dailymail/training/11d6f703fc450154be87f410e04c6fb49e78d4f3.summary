the makers of the latest edition of @entity2 have promised it to be the most realistic ever , with the new ' parking the bus ' mode a welcome addition to the game - especially if you 're @entity9			1
the brand new feature will allow you to set all of your players to drop back into their own area and frustrate the opposition , all with the click of a button			0
@entity9 has previously criticised the likes of @entity18 and @entity19 for adopting the tactic			2
@entity21 and @entity22 form the new look cover of @entity25 ' latest @entity2 video game @entity9 has adopted a @entity27 tactic in the past despite claiming he is not a fan of it the @entity2 player ratings have caused a great deal of excitement ahead of the launch of @entity2 15 @entity35 winger @entity21 is the only @entity36 player to be in the top 10 ratings with a score of 88 new @entity35 striker @entity39 however , the 51 - year - old , who all the way back in 2004 famously vented his frustration at @entity43 for parking the bus at @entity45 in a 0 - 0 draw , may well be a fan of the new feature after masterclassing the tactic in the past			1
the most prominent example of that was when his @entity53 side produced a defensive masterclass to hold on at the @entity55 and earn a place in the 2010 @entity58 final			0
he also utilised it effectively last season as @entity35 secured a 2 - 0 win at @entity62 in april , as a result stemming criticism from his counterpart and friend @entity65			2
