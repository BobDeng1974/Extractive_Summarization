by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:03 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 21:04 est , 7 february 2013 @entity3 ministers are furious at the posters erected by @entity7 - run @entity6 council a @entity7 council has provoked outrage with an advertising campaign warning benefit claimants that cuts will mean they ‘ may have to find work ’			1
@entity13 has spent hundreds of pounds of taxpayers ’ money on 50 posters and an online advert opposing @entity19 cuts in welfare			1
ministers said it was evidence that @entity7 believes welfare claimants should be entitled to sit on state benefits without bothering to go to work			1
the advert , displayed on @entity6 ’s website , features a giant pair of scissors slicing through a pound sign			2
it reads : ‘ the government are making cuts to benefits			2
if you claim benefits , it is likely you will receive less and may have to find work or move to a different property			2
’ it then encourages claimants to contact the town hall ’s benefits support team who ‘ can help make sure you are getting all you are allowed to claim ’			2
the @entity47 last night reported the council to the local government ombudsman for the abuse of taxpayers ’ money			1
work and pensions secretary @entity53 said : ‘ a poster like this suggesting that finding work is a worst - case scenario shows how out of touch @entity7 are			2
’ council leader @entity59 said it ‘ has a duty to provide information , support and advice to its residents ’			1
@entity3 local government minister @entity66 said the authority had been ‘ caught - red handed systematically misusing public funds ’			1
from april , no household will be able to receive more than £ 26,000 in benefits – the average family income			0
housing benefit rules are being changed so claimants will not receive full help with council tax bills if they have unoccupied bedrooms and many benefits will rise by only one per cent			1
but ministers condemned the use of public money to criticise government spending cuts			0
mr @entity66 said : ‘ @entity6 have once again been caught - red handed systematically misusing public funds			1
‘ the money wasted on this scare campaign could have been spent on protecting frontline services , ’ he told the @entity84			1
a section of the @entity6 website suggests claimants may need to find a job to replace benefits two years ago @entity6 attracted similar criticism when it produced a series of posters saying : ‘ the government has cut our money so we are forced to cut services			0
" council leader @entity59 defended the latest publicity drive , insisting it had cost only £ 600			1
‘ we are determined to do everything within our power to alert @entity6 residents to the government ’s benefit cuts and provide support and advice to local people on managing their finances and opportunities to find jobs and training			0
' the row comes after @entity7 policy chief @entity115 warned his party had to stop being seen as the defender of welfare handouts if it wants to win the next election			1
@entity7 policy chief @entity115 warned @entity7 had become fixated with welfare payouts not solving people 's problems in a speech to the left - wing @entity126 think tank last night , he said the party had become fixated with offering tax credits and benefit payments to the less well - off rather than dealing with their wider problems			1
he also revealed that @entity7 may not come forward with any concrete policies until 2014 , when his review enters its ‘ second phase ’			0
mr @entity115 , who is drawing up policies for @entity7 ’s next manifesto , said the party had ‘ stripped down what we think people want into a series of fiscal transfers , often administered by a remote bureaucracy – a transactional culture ’			0
he said @entity7 policy had become ‘ an exercise in fiscal transfers without a deeper story of earning respect and a place in society ’			0
he suggested the party should now focus on promoting ‘ earning and belonging ’ rather than just handing people money			0
‘ the emphasis has to shift from demands exclusively built around simple state expenditure toward interventions and campaigns that bring people together and enable them to improve their common life , ’ he said			0
‘ that will be the future			0
the money is not there to rewind this			0
nor should we wish to do so and simply defend and back pass to the state			0
’ his comments are a direct challenge to mr @entity168 who has campaigned against every attempt by the @entity19 to cut the bloated welfare budget left behind by the last @entity7 government .			2
