‘ @entity14 is experimenting , ’ @entity156 , @entity14 ’s sales director told @entity157			2
‘ we ’re experimenting in design , in sizes , and in features			0
each of the yachts in build has special features in development , and we hope the next step will be to mix and match all these new features in one or two new concepts so future owners can not only have a beautiful , seaworthy and safe vessel , but they can have special features that nobody else has			0
' these will not be special features that are just an experiment , but features clients can touch and feel in other vessels under construction or already floating			0
