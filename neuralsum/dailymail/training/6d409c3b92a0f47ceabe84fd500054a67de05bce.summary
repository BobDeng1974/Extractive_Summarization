' expecting : the pregnant princess ( pictured in september , left , and during a trip to @entity225 last month , right ) has said : ' the prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical , so powerful ' happy day : the princess with father , @entity115 , on her wedding day			1
the proud father has moved to @entity3 to be closer to his daughter as she prepares to become a mother for the first ( and second ) time next month the royal couple announced they were expecting in may but the news that the former @entity237 swimmer had twins on the way was unofficially broken on @entity240 a week later by a friend of the princess 's father			1
@entity151 tv presenter @entity244 , a friend of @entity115 , tweeted : ' my old @entity246 schoolmate @entity115 has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins			0
congrats @entity50 and @entity1 ! ' the official announcement of the twins was only made last month , with the @entity252 releasing a statement that read : ' the prince and @entity255 are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year			1
' with an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies , an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - is n't unusual			1
@entity266 , @entity254 is one royal parent of twins , who with wife princess @entity268 welcomed @entity269 and @entity270 in 2013			2
another is crown prince frederik of denmark and his wife @entity273 , who became parents to prince @entity276 and princess @entity277 in 2011			0
prince @entity278 , @entity7 is yet another royal father of twins , following the birth of @entity281 , @entity282 and prince @entity283 , @entity285 , to his wife @entity286 in 2010			2
but although royal twins are fairly frequent among @entity289 dynasties , among them the @entity221 couple , @entity291 royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years			2
born to @entity297 of @entity298 and his wife @entity299 in 1430 , @entity295 and @entity296 were the first and only twins born to @entity291 royal parents			0
tragically though , @entity295 , the eldest of the two , died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of @entity298 as @entity305 during his marriage to @entity273 , @entity296 sired no fewer than seven children , all of them in separate pregnancies			0
despite the lack of @entity291 royal twins , odds have shortened on another double birth - for the @entity7 and @entity8 - taking place			2
while the @entity221 rules of succession are clear , the @entity291 rules are n't set in stone , although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares , the question of who inherits what is less vexed			0
in theory , with @entity326 already in the royal nursery , the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role			0
as for which parent is responsible for the @entity221 royal twins - or the @entity291 ones , should they come to pass , consultant gynaecologist dr @entity333 says both could be behind a multiple birth , although the mother is the more likely candidate			2
‘ twins are not genetically based , ' he explains			0
' @entity342 twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two , creating identical twins			0
‘ another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised , creating non identical twins			0
‘ if either the mother or the father have twins in their family , the chances of them having twins is higher			0

were joined at the @entity3 by entire royal family
