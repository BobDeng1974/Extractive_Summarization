@entity1 sympathisers took to @entity2 today to share a photograph of a balaclava - clad , left - handed militant they claimed to be a new image of the terror group 's executioner in chief , @entity9			1
brandishing the same style of combat knife used by the @entity13 militant during the sickening filmed murders of three @entity17 nationals , two @entity13 aid workers and 22 @entity20 soldiers , the alleged terrorist bears a striking resemblance to @entity9			1
this is despite the fact his face is largely covered by a similar style of black balaclava worn by the famously left - handed killer in the five chilling @entity1 murder videos in which has appeared			1
the image was widely shared by @entity33 sympathisers today after apparently being uploaded to picture messaging app @entity34 by a @entity37 militant , who captioned it with the words ' do you recognise him ? ' and suggested he had spent ' a day with @entity9 '			2
but despite capturing the attention of the world 's media , it can now be revealed that the image was first uploaded to @entity2 on november 29 by a man claiming to be a @entity48 fighter who has since come forward to say the masked militant in the photograph is in fact him			2
questions : the image was widely shared by @entity1 sympathisers today after apparently being tweeted by a @entity37 jihadi who claimed to have spent the day with @entity9			2
however the same photograph was uploaded to @entity2 last month by a man claiming to be a @entity48 @entity1 fighter real deal : the famously left - handed killer known as @entity9 has now appeared in five @entity1 murder videos the image that apparently showed @entity9 was shared on @entity2 by a radical calling himself @entity63 , who appeared to suggest he had spent time with the @entity1 executioner			1
the photograph was captioned : ' a day with @entity9 - may the eyes of cowards never sleep # @entity69			0
' other @entity1 sympathisers claimed the photograph first emerged on the @entity34 account of a @entity37 militant who captioned it with the words ' do you recognise him ? '			2
but despite the buzz of excitement among warped fans of the cold - blooded killer , it subsequently emerged that the same picture was first shared online late last month by a man claiming to be a @entity48 @entity1 militant who suggested he had been simply pretending to be @entity9			1
this afternoon he returned to @entity2 and , using the account @ @entity87 , began pointing out that the person in the photograph is in fact him			0
denial : despite the buzz of excitement among warped fans of the cold - blooded killer , the same picture was first shared online by a @entity48 militant last month ( below )			0
today the @entity48 said it is him in the photo killer : the real @entity9 was reportedly seriously wounded in an @entity17 - led air strike in november after meeting with @entity1 chiefs , including the group 's leader @entity100 in @entity102 return : the real @entity9 was reportedly seriously wounded in an @entity17 - led air strike in november , but just days later appeared in a sickening filmed beheading video of 22 @entity20 soldiers ( pictured ) adding to the confusion , another set of @entity1 sympathisers claimed the photograph shows an unknown @entity13 militant calling himself @entity112 who they said recently carried out a suicide bombing somewhere in @entity102			1
this claim is likely to be a mistaken reference to @entity118 - a 32 - year - old father of three from @entity119 who used the same @entity121 and who became the 29th @entity123 to die fighting for @entity1 when he carried out a suicide bomb attack in the strategic @entity102 town of @entity126 last month			0
the real @entity9 was reportedly seriously wounded in an @entity17 - led air strike in november after meeting with @entity1 chiefs , including the group 's leader @entity100 in @entity102			0
the masked ‘ executioner ’ was said to have narrowly escaped death when the leadership summit in a town close to the @entity20 border was targeted by @entity17 and @entity102 warplanes			0
just days after the alleged strike , however , the militant appeared in a sickening filmed beheading video of 22 @entity20 soldiers , which also showed the severed head of @entity17 @entity140 .			0

man in image bears striking resemblance to famously left - handed militant
but image was first shared on @entity2 last month by a @entity48 @entity1 fighter
