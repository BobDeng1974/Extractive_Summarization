by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 5 june 2013 it ’s hard to get excited about superhero games , let alone one starring a character many would not have heard of			1
but interestingly , it ’s @entity6 ’s relative obscurity compared to the likes of @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 that will help him stand out from the crowd			2
for those who have n’t heard of @entity6 ( real name , @entity15 ) , he ’s a mentally unstable @entity16 comic character known for his big mouth and affection for weapons			1
he also has the tendency to ‘ break the fourth wall ’ , meaning that he is aware of the audience , and can interrupt the story at will for humorous effect			2
wild ride : it does n't take long to realise that there 's something different about this @entity16 character it ’s this latter reason that made the 45 - minute playthrough so enjoyable			2
voiced by @entity36 star @entity35 , @entity6 ’s unpredictability is as charming as it is intriguing			1
the fact that you never know what he ’s going to do or say helps give the game a distinctive feel			2
he ’ll shout insults at you if you ’re doing something he does n’t like			0
tap on the screen and mock you for following on - screen prompts			0
this is his game , and you play by his rules – not the other way around			0
the danger of setting the standard so high with such a well - executed character , is that the gameplay faces a hard task to catch up			0
it ’s no surprise , then , that combat is not as interesting			1
there ’s no denying that @entity6 has a wide range of authentic moves and weapons to wield , but it all feels very familiar			1
certain parts of the demo simply involved walking from room to room , wiping out as many not - too - bright baddies in the most stylish way possible			0
thankfully , there ’s an upgrade system , so you ’re encouraged to string - together the best combos and there are plenty of rooms to explore and load - up on collectables			1
@entity80 outnumbered , never out - gunned : the harder it is , the more @entity6 seems to enjoy himself but for what @entity6 may lack in innovative gameplay , it makes up in spades by having such an interesting lead character			1
one that is well worth getting excited about			0
@entity6 is released on june 28			0
