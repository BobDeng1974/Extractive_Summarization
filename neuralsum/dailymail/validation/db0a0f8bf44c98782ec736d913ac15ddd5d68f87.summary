a burger flipper from @entity1 has reinvented his fast food business after spending an intense period in the kitchen of one of the country 's top restaurants as part of a new tv programme			1
now hungry burger - lovers keen to try his gourmet - influenced meat are travelling from far and wide to buy them			2
a new six - part @entity16 programme , @entity18 to @entity19 , put @entity20 , 27 , under the tutelage of one of the country 's top chefs , @entity22			1
what happened when the more humble end of the country 's dining spectrum met with the higher echelons of @entity31 cookery ? top chef @entity22 ( left ) tutored @entity20 ( right ) prompting him to turn his food van business around flipping great : @entity20 , 27 , has seen his burgers fly off the shelves of his van after appearing in the television programme			1
plans are afoot to sell burgers wholesale and even open a restaurant previously , @entity20 made a living serving burgers to passing lorry drivers from a lay - by on the @entity43 near @entity44			1
by his own admission , the meat he presented , in a plain white bap , might have left burger aficionados running for the hills			0
his signature dish wasan artery - straining @entity52 burger , a carnivorous concoction that comprised four burgers , four sausages , eight rashers of bacon and , somewhere in between , eight squares of processed cheese			2
however , since his brush with the higher echelons of @entity31 cookery , word of mouth has seen people travel from all over the country to sample his fast food			0
he told the @entity67 news : ' i ’ve had people travel from @entity70 , @entity71 and even @entity72 - that ’s a 125 - mile trip - just to try them			2
' chef @entity22 admits he fully expected @entity20 to wilt under the pressure and was amazed by the young chef 's stoic attitude his fortunes changed after an intense cookery lesson with respected chef @entity22 of @entity80 , @entity81 which prompted a culinary epiphany			1
the results ? hand - pressed 5oz burgers so in demand that @entity20 often has to turn people away			1
so far , the chef admits he 's tinkered with his popular new recipe , which includes rump and chuck steak , cayenne pepper and @entity67 sauce , more than thirty times			1
chef @entity22 admits the two men were operating in separate universes			1
' i ’ve never stopped in one of these places in my life ' , says the chef as he arrives at the burger van in the show in his @entity104			1
@entity20 , whose previous experience as a cook amounted to a stint at @entity108 and working at a pub , was thrown into the deep end of the kitchen at @entity80			2
it was assumed he would falter under the pressure			0
instead @entity20 thrived on the one - on - one time with the chef and despite plenty of less - than - friendly words aimed in his direction , he saw the short apprenticeship through			1
@entity20 is planning to sell his burgers wholesale after local farm shops flocked to stock them before his training at @entity80 , @entity20 served up standard burgers from a below par butcher			2
now his new beef patties , which the recipe for has been tweaked no less than 31 times , includes the following : @entity130 steak chump steak herbs and spices including : cayenne pepper @entity67 sauce after leaving @entity80 , the married father set about trying to adapt what he 'd learned to his own business			1
he quickly dismissed the fancier dishes but did realise that there was a lot he could do to up the quality for his existing customer base			0
he kept the price of favourites the same - a bacon sandwich will still set you back £ 2.70 - but found a butcher selling better quality meat			2
he cleaned his van within an inch of its life			0
he says the chance to aspire for more has been ' life - changing '			0
he told the @entity155 ' it was life - changing for me on a number of levels			0
' ' it ’s made me a better cook for sure , but it ’s also made me appreciate what i have at home too			0
' the sky 's the limit for his business plans too			0
local farm shops are going to stock them raw and @entity20 is planning to sell them wholesale too			0
a restaurant in @entity44 might also be on the cards			0
@entity18 to @entity19 airs tonight on @entity16			0

burger van owner @entity20 , 27 , *transformed* his business after working 16 - hour days under top chef @entity22
he now uses a better butcher and has changed his burger recipe 31 times
word has spread and a customer travelled 125 miles to try one
