by @entity1 reporter published : 06:36 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 08:06 est , 31 october 2012 a motorcyclist badly injured in a crash had to be driven to hospital by his brother after ambulances sent to get him were diverted nine times			1
@entity8 , 24 , lay in agony for 90 minutes after suffering extensive internal bruising in the crash as a paramedic at the scene desperately tried to organise an ambulance			1
but the paramedic was eventually told that the ambulances en route had to be diverted to ' more serious ' incidents nine times and it would be best if the patient made his own way to the hospital			2
crash scene : @entity8 , 24 , lying at the side of road underneath blankets while his brother tries to help him up to take him to the hospital it is unclear how many ambulances had been dispatched			1
mr @entity8 , whose waist had ballooned from 42in to 48in because of the swelling , was forced to ask the paramedic to call his brother to pick him up from the scene of the accident in @entity34 , @entity35 on october 14			1
the injured biker then had to be lifted off the road by his brother @entity38 and friend @entity38 who drove him to @entity40 in @entity35			0
mr @entity8 also suffered damage to his pelvis and ankle and was given morphine by hospital staff to ease his pain			1
mr @entity8 , from @entity47 , @entity35 , said : ' the rapid response paramedic who got to me first was brilliant			1
' she could n't have done any more for me , but the people on the radio said they could n't get an ambulance to me			0
' they kept diverting them to more incidents because i was deemed not serious enough			0
' busy time ' : ambulances sent to the scene were diverted nine times to ' more serious ' incidents ' the paramedic was arguing with them and telling them i could have been bleeding internally but they just said they were sorry and there was nothing they could do			0
' fortunately i did n't suffer any broken bones but i was in so much pain that i really would n't want to know what a broken bone feels like			0
' but mr @entity8 's angry family called for improvements to the ambulance service before lives are lost by delayed response times			2
mr @entity8 's mother @entity78 said : ' does someone have to die before we have a decent , reliable ambulance service with a reasonable response time ? ' an @entity84 spokesman said : ' this incident has already been raised by the @entity86 for investigation because the wait for transport to hospital was not acceptable			2
' the patient was assessed on - scene by a paramedic , who arrived within six minutes , as not being in a life - threatening condition and during this exceptionally busy time all ambulances which became available had to be diverted to life - threatening calls			0

@entity8 , 24 , left with *intensive* internal bruising after @entity35 crash
told to make his own way to hospital after waiting 90 minutes for ambulances that kept being diverted to ' more serious ' incidents
mr @entity8 then had to call his brother to get a lift to the hospital
