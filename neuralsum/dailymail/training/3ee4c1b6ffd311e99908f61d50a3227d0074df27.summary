by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 24 february 2013 a school girl who was in so much pain she became hooked on 12 painkillers - a - day has made an amazing recovery			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , was just 13 when she went for a routine visit to her doctor for what she thought was a common cold			1
but instead she was diagnosed with crippling scoliosis - an extreme curving of the spine - and was given a morphine - like drug for the pain			1
@entity5 from @entity6 ( pictured now 20 ) , who became addicted to painkillers to cope with a debilitating condition has made a remarkable recovery by the time she was 14 she was relying on twelve painkillers a day			1
thanks to an intense course of physiotherapy , miss @entity5 , now 20 , has learnt to deal with the aches without medication			1
she said : ' i was already a hormonal 14 - year - @entity28 just did not want to go outside			1
i was a self conscious teenager			2
i wondered what people were saying about my back and i thought i was ugly			2
' my school attendance was erratic and i could n't walk more than 500 metres			2
since the physiotherapy i can go to university and to work without being in too much pain			1
' i can now manage a day without feeling like i 've been hit by a sledgehammer			1
' an x-ray of @entity5 showing the extreme curving of the spine			1
she was diagnosed with crippling scoliosis she was told that if the scoliosis was left untreated it could lead to fatal heart and lung problems			1
her spine was a 48 degree curve and there was a risk that her rib cage could shift and move her internal organs			1
the only treatment for the chronic condition was a high risk operation where two metal rods would be stuck into her spine and then fused solid			1
but her condition was borderline and doctors refused to operate because she was in too much pain			2
within months she was suffering from chronic pain and could not walk more than fifty metres or go to school without collapsing			2
her mother @entity60 said : ' three months after she was diagnosed , @entity5 had changed			1
she had gone from being a typical , active teenage girl to living life as an 80 - year - old woman , confined to the four walls of her bedroom			1
' she would try walking around , lying on her back and on her front , but nothing helped			2
doctors prescribed @entity5 tramadol , a strong painkiller , to cope			1
the drug is similar to morphine and is only used as a short term answer to chronic pain			1
she was so reliant on painkillers that she was taking four tramadol and eight paracetamol every day			1
mrs @entity5 , 49 , said : ' she was in a terrible state , it was horrendous			1
' she lost so much confidence and i was desperate			0
i tried everything to get her off the medication			0
' to see her in so much pain was so scary			2
i would have driven to the @entity86 to try and help her			0
' her daughter added : ' i was sleeping and i just did n't see a way out of it			0
i could n't see how the situation was going to resolve itself			0
' i was just trying to cope with the here and now and that was the only way i could at that time			0
' her mother said she had reached breaking point when she found a clinic that could help			0
she said : ' i remember speaking to @entity97 who understood everything i was saying			0
they knew how i felt as a parent and how traumatic it could be for the child involved			0
' they drove six hours to the clinic with @entity5 doubled over in pain on the back seat of the car			1
she had a consultation and was put on an intensive exercise therapy course four days later , which consisted of six hours of exercises each day for four weeks			2
she was taught what the condition means , the effects it has on the body and was prescribed an individual physiotherapy treatment			0
she said : ' i was going through withdrawal because i had been taking so many tablets			2
it was one of the worst pains you can imagine			0
' my whole body felt like it was turning in on me , it was absolutely horrendous			0
' i was throwing up violently for about a week and had nausea and muscular cramps			0
' but by the end of the second week of therapy , she was off the painkillers			0
mrs @entity5 said : ' @entity132 is so highly addictive and the person taking it has to want to stop , or else you have n't got a hope in hell			1
she became so reliant on painkillers that she was taking four tramadol and eight paracetamol every day ( stock image ) @entity5 with her mother @entity142			1
her mother said she had reached breaking point when she found a clinic that could help ' @entity97 ' whole body approach to treating scoliosis and dealing with associated pain was that light at the end of the tunnel			1
it was a means to so many ends			0
' we got her down to one tramadol a day			1
stopping her take the last one was such a battle but she realised how important it was to stop			0
she said to me , ' right it 's going to go in the bin '			0
' she spent up to six hours a day at the clinic stretching and strengthening her muscles with intensive exercises			2
she said : ' the exercise therapy changed my life			0
i have no idea where i would have been if my mum had not found the centre when she did			0
' i could not do anything and my whole life was just slipping away from me			0
' her pain had been caused by an imbalance of the muscles and after her muscles had been strengthened and stretched , she said it had almost disappeared			2
she said : ' the clinic has given me the confidence to believe in myself			0
i feel like i am in control again and scoliosis no longer rules my life			2
' miss @entity5 returns to the @entity183 clinic every couple of months for a two - hour session to review her progress and keep her on track			1
instead of numbing the pain the drugs , @entity5 will now exercise or take a hot bath to ease her aching back			1
she said her pain has gone from excruciating to an occasional ache			2
she is studying psychology at @entity193 and wants to help other young girls			0
she said : ' i have loved every second of university and i really do put my happiness down to these exercises			0
' my mum has stood by me and fought so hard to help me			0
i do n't feel like a hunchback anymore			0
i am normal and i can finally look forward to my future			0
