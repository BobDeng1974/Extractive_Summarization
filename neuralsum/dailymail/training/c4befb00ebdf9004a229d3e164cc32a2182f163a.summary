a mother of two is turning horses into real life @entity3 after inventing temporary tattoos for the animals made from glitter			1
@entity7 , 40 , from @entity8 , has taken inspiration from the ancient tradition of quarter - marking whereby hair on a horse 's rear quarter is brushed into patterns for show			1
the former beauty spa director has dubbed her venture ' quarter - marketing ' as brands can use the tattoos to stick their logos on the horses			1
the glue does n't touch the horse 's skin so vets say it 's safe to use and the tattoos can be washed off with soap , water and a brush			1
@entity7 came up with the idea for the sparkly marks while looking for a way to generate extra income after becoming a mother - of - two			1
she explains : ' i used to be the managing director of a beauty spa until 2009 when i gave it up to look after my two young children			0
' quarter - marketing ' : brands can use the tattoos to stick their logos on the horses			1
temporary : the pictures last a day or two weeks depending on the glue used ' i had been dabbling with different ideas to bring a bit more money in when i came across someone doing glitter tattoos at a craft fair			1
' my daughter fell in love with them straight away and so i started doing them at children 's parties			0
' about a year ago my in - laws from @entity78 were visiting and knowing they have horses i just said : " i do n't know why no - one has made these for horses "			2
' it was a lightbulb moment for me - the more i thought about it the more it seemed like a good idea			0
' i started to look into it and realised there was a real gap in the market			0
' no need to be good at drawing : the tattoos are applied using a stencil to ensure a perfect picture familiar look : the marks on the side of the horses are reminiscent of @entity3 toys , right a year after her eureka moment @entity7 has turned her idea into a fully - fledged business			1
@entity7 's equestrian glitter tattoo kits cost between £ 19.99 and £ 59.99 and can be bought from her website glamouratiuk.com			0
the tattoos are applied using a stencil to ensure a perfect picture			0
@entity7 said the products have been popular with horse owners and have been approved by vets			2
she said : ' we spent a lot of time developing an adhesive that was long lasting but easily washed off			0
we then tried out our new products on some horses at our local riding school and they were an instant hit			0
' @entity120 and sparkle is huge in the world of equestrian accessories and now the horses can have some too , ' inventor @entity7 said popular : @entity7 has turned her idea into a successful business ' we then had a stall at a big horse show and we had queues of people waiting to get glitter tattoos on their horses			2
' it 's like a 21st century version of quarter - marking , but because of the possibilities for brands to put their logos on horses i call it quarter - marketing			1
' the glitter kits are completely safe to use - they have been given the thumbs up by vets			2
' @entity120 and sparkle is huge in the world of equestrian accessories and now the horses can have some too			0
' when the sun comes out you ca n't describe how amazing the glitter tattoos look			0
