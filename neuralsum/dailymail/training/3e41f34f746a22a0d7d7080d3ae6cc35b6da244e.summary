loss : @entity0 , 23 , died after he was punched in the chest while doing a ' @entity3 ' drinking game with friends a young father died after taking part in a dangerous new ‘ @entity9 ’ craze that is sweeping the nation			1
@entity0 , 23 , collapsed after trading heavy punches with another man in the violent ‘ game ’ during a birthday party			1
he was rushed to hospital by ambulance in a critical condition but died an hour later without ever regaining consciousness			1
last night his family lashed out at revellers who filmed the violent clash and its tragic aftermath instead of helping to save the stricken young man			1
@entity23 , 38 , one of his three brothers , said they have been left ‘ devastated ’ by the tragedy which they are still struggling to understand			1
he said : ‘ i ca n’t believe my little brother has lost his life			1
he was punched in the heart and it stopped beating			1
‘ he ’s got a little girl and she does n’t know yet			0
how do you tell a three - year - old her dad is dead ? she does n’t even know what it means			1
’ @entity9 , which began in the @entity37 , is the latest reckless game of dare to take hold of the internet			1
social networking sites are full of photos of young men showing off bloody cuts and large bruises after exchanging punches , often while being filmed			1
the tragedy echoes the neknominate drinking game which has claimed several young victims who were dared to drink huge amounts of alcohol			1
@entity52 , who worked for his father ’s removal firm , collapsed shortly after midnight on sunday morning at a 16th birthday party at a house opposite his home in @entity60 , @entity61			1
witnesses said he traded several blows with another man , aged 20 , before falling to the ground after a heavy blow to his upper chest			1
@entity69 said : ‘ even if they were exchanging punches , you ca n’t just play games and kill someone			0
it was a massive punch to the heart			1
’ paying tribute to his brother , @entity23 added : ‘ i ’m facing my worst fear			2
it has come real and he is dead			0
i would call him every weekend to make sure he was n’t getting in with the wrong crowd			0
‘ he was a well - loved character and his death has sent shockwaves everywhere			2
there are so many tributes to him it is surreal			0
‘ it has devastated my whole family			0
he had a heart of gold and has never done anything wrong to anyone – and now his life has been taken away			0
’ another brother , @entity93 , 36 , added that life would never ‘ be the same again ’ and slammed those who watched @entity52 suffer the fatal injury			1
writing online , he said : ‘ for the people that was at the party that can see this call yourself friends … you should have stopped it not try and film it			1
’ a @entity109 spokesman confirmed that the 20 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been released on bail until september			1
a post mortem examination was inconclusive and the family has been warned it could take months for forensic tests to be completed			0
investigation : the young father 's death is being treated as unexplained rather than suspicious by police dozens of pictures were posted online in tribute to @entity52 as his family and large circle of friends learned of the tragedy			0
friends said @entity23 , a @entity129 soccer fan , idolised his only child , three - year - old @entity130			1
his father @entity131 , 60 , was too upset to speak and has already put his semi-detached home on the market			0
a tribute page set up by best friend @entity135 attracted more than 1000 ‘ likes ’			0
mr @entity135 said : ‘ he was my best friend in the whole world			0
’ @entity138 is a social media challenge and drinking game that started in the @entity37 and has now landed in the @entity141			1
the two players have one hand tied behind their back and take it in turns to punch each other with the free hand until one player gives up			2
their defeat usually involves a forfeit , often related to drinking excessive amounts of alcohol			2
the challengers usually punch each other in the arm , but some players target other areas of the body , sometimes even the head			2
like @entity162 , the challenge is filmed and then posted online for others to see			2
dozens of films of young men exchanging blows in ‘ @entity9 ’ can be found on @entity168 and via social networking sites such as @entity170 and @entity171			0
in many cases those involved drink shots of spirits in between punches as crowds cheer and jeer their progress			0
the loser pays a forfeit , which inevitably means drinking more alcohol			2
the fad comes in the wake of the @entity162 online drinking contest which was linked to several deaths earlier this @entity186 included @entity187 , 20 , who died in february after downing a lethal cocktail of wine , whisky and vodka at a backpackers ’ hostel in @entity194			1
investigators appealed for anyone who filmed or photographed the fatal confrontation to hand over the material			2
det insp @entity199 said : ‘ @entity52 's death is being treated as unexplained but i would urge any of his friends who were at the party on the night of his death to make contact			0
‘ i am especially interested in any images or footage from the nights of his death			0
’ a @entity109 spokesman said : ‘ we await the results of a post mortem			0
it is being treated as an unexplained death rather than suspicious			0
’ @entity216 said they were originally called to treat a man for a ‘ cardiac arrest ’			0
he was taken to @entity219 where he died			2
the @entity162 craze is only thought to have started in january this year in @entity221 , @entity222 , but has quickly spread via social media			2
it is a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on @entity171 and other social media sites drinking dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol and then dare their friends to outdo them			1
an early example of the trend was a woman who was filmed riding a horse into a supermarket before downing a can of @entity237			0
but the videos have become increasingly dark with three deaths in @entity141 now linked to the craze			0
in march @entity241 , 20 , from @entity242 , was found dead after he filmed himself downing almost two pints of gin mixed with teabags .			0

@entity0 collapsed after punch to the chest during drinking game
the 23 - year - old was taken to hospital and died shortly afterwards
his *heartbroken* brothers slammed the game and those who filmed it
' you should have stopped it not try and film it ' , said his older brother
