a mother - of - three has told of how a boob job saved her life – as she discovered she had cancer after knocking one of her newly - enlarged breasts			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , believed breast feeding had left her chest saggy and thought implants would boost her confidence			1
the 33 - year - old saved up £ 4,000 to go from a @entity14 to a @entity15 and was pleased with her new look			0
then , in april 2012 , she was sorting out some washing and knocked her right breast on a door frame because of its increased size			1
but remarkably , she soon found out she was pregnant after finishing treatment			1
she is pictured with daughter @entity28 , now nine months she found a pea - sized lump , which hospital tests revealed was cancerous			1
she began six months of chemotherapy , followed by radiotherapy and surgery and is now in remission			2
she says her implants saved her life , because as she did n't regularly check for lumps , without knocking her breast she might not have discovered the tumour until it was too late			2
it was after breastfeeding her first baby @entity40 , who is now 12 , that mrs @entity6 first decided she wanted a boob job			1
' i was left with saggy breasts after feeding , ' she said			2
' there was just no tissue left , so i decided to get implants to restore my confidence			0
' i thought they would improve how i felt about myself			0
i did n't know they would save my life too			0
' mrs @entity6 , a semi-permanent makeup technician , said she was happy with her new breasts after having the procedure , and settled down to life as a new mother			1
she went on to have her daughter , @entity57 - @entity56 , in 2010			0
but , three years ago she was sorting through some laundry when she caught her breast on the door frame			1
breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the @entity64			1
in 2011 , just under 50,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer			1
most women who get it ( 8 out of 10 ) are over 50 , but younger women , and in rare cases , men , can also get breast cancer			1
most breast lumps are n't cancerous , but it 's always best to have them checked by a doctor			2
a person should see a gp if they notice any of the following symptoms : * an area of thickened tissue * nipple discharge , which may contain blood * a change in the size or shape of your breasts * dimpling on the skin of your breasts * a rash on or around your nipples * a change in your nipple 's appearance – for example , becoming sunken into your breast * persistent pain in your breasts or armpits * a lump or swelling in your armpits source : @entity105 rubbing the sore area , she felt a pea - sized lump and her husband @entity109 , 36 , urged her to visit her gp			1
mrs @entity6 said : ' i was only 30 and did n't think it would be anything to worry about			1
' i just went to put my mind at ease			0
' the doctor referred me to hospital for further tests			2
i was told it was very unlikely to be anything sinister , but they wanted to be cautious			2
' a few weeks later doctors advised her to have a lumpectomy test , and this confirmed she had cancer , which is extremely unusual in someone her age			2
while breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the @entity64 , 8 out of ten women who get it are over 50 years old			1
mrs @entity6 describes the pure terror of being given such a diagnosis			1
she said : ' i was devastated			0
i just kept crying thinking i was going to die and imagining my children growing up without me			0
' that july , she began six months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy , but the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes surrounding her breast			1
she then had an operation to remove five lymph nodes containing cancerous cells , and afterwards doctors were confident she was in remission			1
however , they said the treatment would probably leave her unable to have more children			2
she explained : ' afterwards , they told me they 'd got all the cancer but that i would n't have anymore children as a result of the treatment			1
' i would have liked more , but i was already lucky enough to have one of each and was just so happy to be alive			0
' all thanks to my boob job			1
' mrs @entity6 only went to her gp about the lump she had found because husband @entity109 , 36 ( pictured here with her on their wedding day ) begged her to go mrs @entity6 says her implants saved her life and will allow her to see her children , including her youngest baby @entity28 ( pictured ) grow up			1
now , she urges all women to check their breasts for lumps however , she soon suspected she might be pregnant and took a test , which revealed she was , in fact expecting			2
her daughter @entity174 , is now nine months old , sister to @entity40 , 12 and @entity175 , five			0
she describes @entity174 as her ' second miracle '			0
' the first is discovering the lump			2
it was less than a centimetre in size , so if i had n't knocked my breast , i would never have felt it			1
' ' who knows what would have happened ? i never checked my breasts			0
i would n't in a million years have thought it was necessary at my age			0
' i thought breast cancer was something that affected older women			1
' having implants was a confidence thing			0
i wanted to be able to wear a bikini and feel good about myself			0
' but if they 'd stayed the same size i would never have knocked them			0
' my implants saved my life			0
i 'd ask all women – however young – to check their breasts			0
' one in five women later diagnosed with breast cancer had originally put off making a @entity205 appointment for at least four weeks thousands of women are risking their lives by waiting more than a month before seeing their gp after spotting breast cancer symptoms			2
one in five diagnosed with the disease had put off making an appointment for at least four weeks , allowing the cancer time to spread and potentially reducing their chance of survival			0
and one in 20 had delayed seeing the doctor for more than six months , according to a survey of patients			0
some said they were scared about what they might be told , while others were worried they would be seen as a nuisance			0
women in their fifties and sixties were among the worst culprits , the poll by the charity @entity229 found , because they wrongly assumed they were in the clear after they had been through menopause			0
@entity64 has one of the worst cancer survival rates in @entity234 and this has been blamed on the disease being detected too late			0
breast cancer patients in the @entity64 have a five - year survival rate of 81 per cent , lagging behind many @entity234 countries , with @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 boasting an 83 per cent survival rate back in the mid- 1990s .			2

@entity6 had a boob job as her chest sagged after breast feeding
in april 2012 , she knocked her right breast on a door and found a lump
tests showed it was cancer so she had surgery removing her lymph nodes
she became pregnant despite being told cancer treatment causes infertility
