by @entity0 a new study has revealed that students who do better academically in high school will go on to earn more money later in life			1
the findings prove that spending extra time on studies pays off for both sexes , but especially for teenage boys			0
a one - point difference in a student 's grade point average could lead to a double - digit percentage pay increase			0
for young women , a boost in their gpa corresponds to a 13.77 per cent pay increase and men have an 11.85 per cent increase			1
though young women have a higher boost , they are still lagging far behind their male peers in terms of pay overall - even though their gpa scores are ' significantly higher '			2
as a result , the research conducted by the @entity28 was split by sex but a side - by - side comparison of the pay by gender shows the dramatic gap that comes in spite of the fact that there are more young women who preformed better academically in high school			1
for example , young men who earned a 3.0 @entity16 made approximately $ 41,000 while young women earned about $ 36,000			0
by comparison , young men who scored a 4.0 made approximately $ 48,000 while young women who scored the same earned about $ 28,000			2
all of the salary data was taken from young a group of young professionals between 24 and 34 years old , and the research was based on their reported academic success			0
hitting the books : young men 's salaries go up by nearly 12 per cent for each extra @entity16 point @entity53 , the @entity28 professor who led the research team , did not give any insight into the gender disparity , but did note some racial indicators			1
' the results suggest that african - americans with poor high school gpas are less likely to graduate from high school and attend college , but once @entity16 and other factors are included in the models , they are actually more likely than other races to graduate from college and continue to graduate school , ' mr @entity53 said			1
' one possible explanation for this finding is that african - americans with relatively high gpas are more motivated and determined than whites to attend college and obtain an advanced degree			0
' the concept behind the study - that those who are stronger academically will go on to succeed in professional life - does not come as a shock but this is the first research of its kind			0
' conventional wisdom is that academic performance in high school is important for college admission , but this is the first study to clearly demonstrate the link between high school gpa and labor market earnings many years later , ' professor @entity53 said in a release			1
' high school guidance counselors and teachers can use these findings to highlight the importance of doing well in high school for both short term ( college admission ) and longer term ( earnings as an adult ) goals			2

@entity28 study notes that there are far more **female** high school students who earn 4.0 gpas but does *n't* follow in terms of salary
young professional men *constantly* out - earn their **female** *counterparts*
for both genders , salaries go up more than 11 per cent for each extra gpa point the student earned in high school
