@entity0 has challenged @entity1 to step up and to assume responsibility as a senior player this season saying that the @entity6 midfielder can no longer be considered a young starlet			1
@entity0 believes that @entity1 has been held back by his ankle injury in the past and now that is no longer a worry , he should deliver consistently throughout the season			1
but the pictures of @entity15 smoking on his recent break in @entity17 also led to a pre-season meeting with @entity0 and reprimands , with the midfielder since apologising for his behaviour			1
@entity0 said : ‘ he ’s 22 and with the experience he has i do n’t consider him anymore as a guy who is just starting the game			1
i consider him as a player			2
for him the problem until now was medical			0
i think he ’s over it now			0
it ’s the first time i ’ve seen him not miss a session since the start of the preparations			0
it ’s an important year for @entity1 : very important			2
@entity1 is in danger of missing out of @entity6 ’s first eleven with @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 all likely to be ahead of him with @entity53 and @entity54 favoured for more defensive roles but @entity0 says that he has the ability to match the progress @entity50 made last season , when the @entity59 transformed himself into being @entity6 ’s most important player			1
setback : @entity0 believes that @entity1 has been held back by his ankle injury in the past ‘ i wish that he does that because if the two work together at that level we have a very strong midfield			1
he was until now a doubt a little bit through injuries			0
at top - level you need to be consistent with your presence			0
' you can play six , seven , eight games and rest one or two but you have to play six , seven on the trot			0
i think he will be capable of doing it			0
he has no ankle problem anymore			2
it could be his year			0
’ @entity1 could start the @entity78 against @entity79 today with @entity52 not returning to the club until monday after winning the @entity30 with @entity81 , though @entity0 may yet prefer @entity82			1
in and out : @entity1 was on the fringes during @entity31 's @entity30 campaign back in the day : @entity0 admits that @entity1 can no longer rely on his talented youngster tag and former @entity6 captain @entity86 has also challenged @entity1 to prove himself this season			1
‘ he must show more hunger and professionalism , ’ said @entity88			0
‘ he ’s in danger of not fulfilling his potential and his career could be over in the blink of an eye			0
‘ if push came to shove , for a cup final or a big match , @entity0 would pick @entity52 ahead of @entity1			1
he should have taken it as a personal insult that @entity6 went out and signed @entity52 when they already had the same talent at their disposal in him			2
’ @entity103 also criticised @entity1 last season saying that he had not improved in five years .			2
