is it just us , or are typical @entity9 gifts beginning to feel a little bit tired ? if you too are bored of the traditional 14 february cliches , perhaps it 's time to take a page out of this innovative @entity17 husband 's book			2
or , rather , to tear a leaf out of his post-it notepad ...			0
in what is possibly the cheapest ( and most adorable ) @entity23 's gift we 've heard of this year , @entity25 , a creative wedding photographer from @entity26 , has set about telling his wife @entity27 that he loves her every day for 100 , with reasons why she 's so special scribbled on 100 post-it notes			1
he has then filmed each one , posting them to give it 100 , a website encouraging people to pursue a creative project for 100 days			1
@entity25 is 25 days into his project , and has so far offered reasons for his devotion that range from the touching ( ' you listen to my stories ' ) to the funny ( ' you secretly like cats ' ) to the sincerely proud ( ' you do n't like going to work , but you are stonking good at your job ' )			1
the project is titled simply : ' i 'm telling my wife i love her for 100 days			1
' alongside the husband 's 100 - day tribute to his wife , other site users have remarked how devoted he is , and what a lovely idea his is			1
@entity61 commented that ' every woman in the world will be in love with you ! ' while @entity66 said : ' this is a really cute idea			0
i 'm sure she loves it			0
' @entity69 , clearly having a few troubles in her own love department , wrote : ' i needed to see this today			0
real men still do exist			0
' day 14 : you listen to my stories day 9 : you do n't let me leave the house without fixing my hair day 1 : you are more beautiful than i could ever imagine day 3 : listening to you sing next to me on sunday morning			2
it does n't get much better day 2 : you only share your true humour with me day 4 : i love those rare times when i can get you to truly smile before 7am			2
