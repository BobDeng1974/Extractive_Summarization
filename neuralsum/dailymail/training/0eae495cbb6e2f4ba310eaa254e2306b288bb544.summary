' ' i have had my most horrible life experience played out and debated in local and national media that could n't care a less about me			0
' @entity1 also spoke in front of judge @entity22 , at first declining and then later agreeing to answer a question posed by the former justice , according to @entity43			1
' i would like to know in what manner , verbally or physically , that [ the accuser ] gave consent , ' the former justice asked			1
' both , @entity48 , verbally and physically , ' @entity1 answered			2
' and what did she say and what did she do ? ' @entity22 questioned			0

' departing : @entity1 's accuser said she had to leave @entity8 and received death threats and harassment as police investigated pursuing criminal charges demands : @entity1 's attorney @entity68 previously submitted a letter to @entity8 officials claiming that an attorney for the accuser had tried to extort @entity1 for $ 7million ' @entity73 will no doubt go on to be an even bigger celebrity in @entity75			1
but before he leaves here he deserves to have some accountability for his violent behavior , ' the accuser said in transcripts			2
' perhaps even being expelled will have minimal deterrent effect on him			0
