the @entity1 squad continued to close ranks around @entity3 as they prepared for wednesday ’s crucial third one - day international against @entity4			1
with the tourists 2 - 0 down in the seven - match series and @entity3 ’s contribution a patchy 32 runs from 54 balls , the pressure is on the captain to perform a double rescue act : save his side – and save himself			1
and he will be telling himself that the two come as a package			0
off - spinner @entity16 became the latest player to loyally defend his skipper , describing @entity3 as ‘ a class player ’ and insisting : ‘ i ’m sure there is a score around the corner ’			1
the pressure on @entity1 captain @entity3 continues to mount in @entity4 but @entity1 off - spinner @entity16 has leapt to his skipper 's defence ahead of the third odi @entity3 was on the sweep during practice ahead of the clash with @entity4 in @entity31 but that corner is in danger of looking more like a dead end			1
if @entity1 fail to win four of their last five games – a task that looks beyond them after they succumbed with alarming ease in @entity41 on saturday – they will have lost five bilateral one - day series in a row under @entity3			1
a heavy series defeat in this series , plus the continuation of @entity3 ’s personal drought – he has not passed 80 in one - day cricket since june 2012 – could leave the @entity50 hierarchy in an embarrassing position , especially with the captain understood to be desperate to turn things around			1
between now and the start of the @entity55 on february 14 , @entity1 have a maximum of only 10 one - day internationals			1
national selector @entity58 insisted two months ago that @entity3 would be captain at the @entity55			2
but even his closest allies are struggling to sustain a convincing defence			0
in the past few days sir @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 have all called for him to resign , though many feel @entity3 should have quit the format after leading a test revival against @entity67 in the summer			2
@entity63 pleaded with @entity3 to resign after the humiliating second odi defeat in @entity41 @entity70 ( left ) and @entity16 bowl during the session ahead of another one - day clash @entity73 chats to @entity1 coach @entity74 during a net session on monday afternoon @entity76 was one of the @entity1 batsman who struggled for runs on saturday in @entity4 @entity16 , though , was unconvinced that a crisis is brewing			1
‘ everyone keeps going on about him , but we do n’t really notice it in the dressing room , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s pretty level - headed and calm about it			2
’ it might help if @entity3 ’s obvious replacement within this tour party , @entity76 , was on top of his game			1
but he is without a one - day half - century in 14 innings			0
for the moment , the magic has deserted him			0
without it , @entity1 will have little chance of mounting a serious assault on the @entity55			2
‘ whenever someone goes through a slump , it can become difficult , ’ said @entity16			2
‘ we all know what @entity76 is like			0
he is a very astute person and he ’s working very hard			0
‘ it is frustrating for everyone really			0
we ’re all working as hard as we can on our skills and when things do n’t go right it is not a nice feeling			0
‘ maybe some of our skills are not up to scratch and that is what we ’re trying to put right			0
if we get everything right in the same game we ’re going to hurt people			0
’ the worry is that @entity1 – already missing the injured @entity115 and @entity116 – lack the all - round quality to compete with a @entity119 side who have got their recent 5 - 0 hammering in @entity67 out of their system			1
they may not even be too inconvenienced by @entity124 ’s withdrawal from the third one - day international for personal reasons attempts have been made to rationalise the two defeats in @entity41			0
@entity1 admit they bowled badly in allowing @entity4 to post 317 in the series opener , and @entity3 said he had been wrong to bat first in the second game on saturday			1
but these are details , and there is no mistaking the bigger picture			0
here , amid the dense vegetation of @entity4 ’s south coast , it feels easy to go missing in the jungle			2
@entity1 ’s one - day team needs to find itself again – and fast .			1

@entity16 backs @entity3 to turn @entity1 fortunes around
@entity1 are two - *nil* down in the @entity143 against @entity4
@entity3 has struggled for runs at the top of the order for the last year
