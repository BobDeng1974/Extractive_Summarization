a sleeping couple in a @entity2 suburb were jolted awake by the sound of their car horn at 3am on monday and called 911 fearing their car was being stolen			1
instead they found a black bear sitting behind the wheel			1
the smarter - than - average bear had managed to open the unlocked door attracted by the smell of food the couple had left , but managed to lock himself in and started frantically flailing around , setting off the car horn			1
when wildlife services arrived to the @entity20 , @entity21 home , they simply opened the door and let the agitated bear run away , leaving behind damage to the tune of $ 15,000			1
' scroll down for @entity26 ' i am in ! ' the bear was photographed by the @entity29 stuck inside the couple 's car after letting himself in through an unlocked door ' our bears are really smart , ' said @entity35 , a public information officer for @entity36			1
' if the door ’s not locked and it ’s one of those lift - latch doors they can get in there			1
' @entity42 told @entity43 31 that in future , the couple will take care to not only lock their car door but not leave food sitting inside - especially as it has cost them a small fortune			1
' for the most part , when animals are trapped like that , i think they can get pretty stressed out and agitated , ' said @entity42			2
' just like we would			2
' ' where to ? ' the couple were woken up by the sound of their car horn and thought their car was being stolen			2
it was n't temper : the black bear became agitated inside the suv and caused $ 15,000 worth of damage trying to get out despite the mildly comical nature of the bear break - in , @entity42 said she doubts the bear will ever come back			1
' a few years ago in @entity75 , a bear got into a car , flipped the emergency break and rolled all the way down a hill in the car , ' said @entity42 to @entity43 31			2
' it was still locked in when our officer came to get it out			0
' i do n’t think we ’ve ever heard from that bear in @entity75 again , ' said @entity42			2
' i think he took off like a shot			0
' @entity36 in @entity2 also took the opportunity to remind the public to be especially vigilant now with their property , because of bears looking for food			1
' it ’s important to keep in mind that this is the time of year , ' said @entity42 to @entity43 31			0
' @entity97 is when the bears need to eat like 10,000 calories a day , in order to pack on pounds to get through their hibernation during the winter			0
' obstacle : in @entity106 , @entity105 was woken by the sound of his car alarm and checked his surveillance cameras and saw this mountain lion			0
the date is incorrect because mr. @entity105 has never set it to the correct one the mountain lion checked out mr. @entity105 's car , but failed to find a way inside the inviting car and in @entity106 , @entity118 , on tuesday , a man was startled awake by the sound of his car alarm , only to check his home surveillance footage to find a mountain lion had set it off by climbing on the roof			1
@entity105 was woken at 2.50am , but thought nothing of it , assumming a passer - by had caused the alarm to go off			0
' i did n’t expect that , ' he said to the @entity128 after reviewing the footage			0
' i thought someone passed by			0
' @entity105 also passed on the video to his neighbors to warn them to beware over the coming days			0
' people walk around here at night time and walk with their dogs , so it 's dangerous for the people if they do n't know , ' said @entity105 to @entity139			0
while @entity105 's neighbors said they think the big cat came out of @entity142 , they have only ever seen @entity143 and wild boar .			0
