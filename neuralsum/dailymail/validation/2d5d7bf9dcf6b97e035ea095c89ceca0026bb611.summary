dr @entity0 , director of @entity2 's secret x lab , has described @entity3 as the ' poster child ' for privacy issues - but insisted we 'll ' be seeing a lot more ' of the technology very soon			1
speaking at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , on tuesday , the 44 - year - old defended the headset by saying it just used cameras that were already in existence			1
he also slammed the way people use @entity2 [ x ] to highlight privacy concerns			1
the claims were made at @entity26 in @entity11 , @entity12 , on tuesday speaking to @entity28 after the talk , dr @entity0 also gave a rare glimpse into the workings of @entity2 [ x ] , and made a rallying call for diversity in every industry			1
' @entity3 did not move the needle , ' he explained			1
' it was literally a rounding error on the number of cameras in your life			2
' the ' smart glasses ' , which act as a computer screen in front of your eyes , sparked furious debate when they were rolled out to the general public - which dr @entity0 concedes was a mistake			1
in a bid to get feedback on the first prototype , ' we did things which encouraged people to think of this as a finished product '			0
@entity60 's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m ( 4.9ft ) and have four electrically - driven propellers			1
the total weight , including the package to be delivered , is approximately 10kg ( 22lb )			0
the aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg ( 18.7lb )			0
the hybrid ' tail sitter ' design has wings for fast forward flight , and rotors for hovering for delivery and vertical take - off and landing			2
dual mode operation gives the self - flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters			2
it can take off or land without a runway , and can hold its position hovering in one spot to gently drop packages			0
packages are stored in the drone 's ' belly ' then dropped on a string before being gently lowered to the ground			2
at the end of the tether , there 's a little bundle of electronics the team call the ' egg , ' which detects that the package has hit the ground , detaches from the delivery , and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle			2
and though it has disappeared from the market for further testing , he assured @entity28 ' you 'll be seeing a lot more of @entity3 very soon			1
' another source of controversy is the self - driving car , with fears that technical glitches - even by accident - could pose as a significant safety hazard			2
laughing , dr @entity0 dismissed that theory			1
' @entity121 text when they 're meant to actually be driving			0
so imagine what they do when they think the car 's got it under control			2
' the assumption that humans can be a reliable back - up for the system is a total fallacy			2
' for now , the focus is on @entity60 , autonomous drones which could deliver products across a city within minutes			1
dr @entity0 revealed the firm will make a major announcement on @entity60 's progress later this year			1
@entity2 founder @entity138 ( @entity139 ) and designer @entity140 wearing @entity3			1
and though it has disappeared from the market for further testing , he assured @entity28 ' you 'll be seeing a lot more of @entity3 very soon			1
' among the current crop of experiments , dubbed ' moonshots ' , is the self - driving car , a giant kite - style wind turbine that hangs from a string , autonomous drones , and @entity154 , which aims to bring internet signal to the four billion unconnected people in the world using balloons			0
dr @entity0 , the so - called captain of moonshots , told @entity10 that the company has had to fly in helicopters to every end of the @entity163 - from the @entity164 to the @entity165 - to retrieve balloons which exploded during initial experiments for @entity154			1
' we designed our early balloons to fail , ' he said			0
a moonshot is something akin to @entity173 's mission to get a man on the moon by 1961 , dr @entity0 explained			1
' but what was not ideal was going to pick them up			0
' and in their desperation to speed up the manufacturing process of the 60 - foot balloons , they even tested the engineers ' socks to see which made them more agile and therefore more efficient			0
' we got the techies to wear thin cotton socks and do a line dance , ' he laughed			0
' then we got them to put on the fluffy socks and line dance again â€¦ now they all wear fluffy socks			0
' a moonshot is something akin to @entity173 's mission to get a man on the moon by 1961 , dr @entity0 explained			1
it has to tackle a problem that improves the state of the world , have a key technical obstacle that needs to be solved , and be environmentally friendly and efficient			0
and no idea is off limits - if it fits the criteria			0
' you 'd be surprised the number of people that come up to me and say ' let 's get rid of corruption ! ' , ' he said			0
' i say , ' yeah sure but that 's not a moonshot '			0
' the key component , dr @entity0 declared , is diversity in the company			1
' people throw around the word ' diversity ' like it 's a tip at a restaurant			0
' but really , having people who have different mental perspectives is what 's important			0
' if you want to explore things you have n't explored , having people who look just like you and think just like you is not the best way			0
' @entity2 has built and tested self flying drones designed to deliver packages			2
called @entity60 , it is being developed at @entity232 , the company 's secret research lab , which is also developing its self - driving car			1

dr @entity0 described @entity3 as ' poster child ' for privacy issues
director of @entity2 's secret @entity232 lab said it used cameras that already existed
speaking at the @entity245 in @entity11 , @entity12 he insisted we 'll ' be seeing a lot more ' of the technology very soon
the 44 - year - old added that the lab 's focus is now on @entity60
