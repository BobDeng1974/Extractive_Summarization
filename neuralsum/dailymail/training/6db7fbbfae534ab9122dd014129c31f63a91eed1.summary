attendance : 35,699 ratings by @entity94 at @entity2 there will be another inquest up at the training ground on monday after @entity30 ’s team slumped to their four defeat in five home matches in the @entity34			2
@entity35 were streets ahead of them : slick , organised , disciplined and focused			2
all the things @entity13 want to be but never will be			2
does n’t it hurt to be booed off at half - time ? is n’t it humiliating to be dragged off , as @entity60 and @entity58 were , after just 45 minutes ? ‘ tactical reasons , ’ claimed @entity30			2
@entity35 were rampant in the first half , taking the lead through the wriggling figure of @entity32 and doubling it when @entity41 scored with a simple tap in			1
bar @entity62 ’s glorious strike , a volley at the back stick 12 minutes from time , this was dreadful			1
there is no patter to @entity13 ’s play			2
we were promised one of the best coaches in world football , one of the most innovative in the @entity34 when @entity30 was head - hunted from @entity126			0
he does n’t have the answers			0
to watch @entity56 delay his arrival as a substitute when his team were 2 - 0 down by electing to changing his boots makes you feel sick			1
that is what the half - hour warm up is for and the weather conditions had n’t changed			0
instead , the storm clouds are gathering here again			0
when they were chasing the game seven minutes from time , their dopey right back @entity51 was dismissed for a foolish nudge on @entity79			1
so , to @entity35 , then , and this glitzy performance. , @entity32 ’s first goal in @entity146 football was a good ‘ un , ghosting - make that coasting - past @entity13 ’s non-existent defence to lash the opener beyond @entity50			1
can @entity32 , once tipped to be even better that @entity150 during his spell at @entity152 , do it on a wet , windy night in @entity35 ? that ’s not so clear cut , but what we do know is that the little @entity158 forward found @entity2 to his liking			1
the beauty of playing @entity13 is that you always know they will give you a chance sooner or later			2
they obliged , of course they did			0
@entity13 midfielder @entity57 gets stuck in as he tries to take the ball from @entity35 forward @entity80 @entity32 looks focused as he strikes the ball after six minutes to give visitors @entity35 the lead @entity32 is congratulated by @entity39 but @entity35 manager @entity87 ( right ) does not show any emotion after the goal @entity32 ran from the halfway line to near the edge of the box to score - click here for more from our @entity4 @entity77 ( right ) and @entity13 centre half @entity179 battle for the ball in the first half @entity183 miles @entity13 113.4 70.5 @entity63 90 11.4 7.1 @entity57 90 11.2 7.0 @entity52 90 11.1 6.9 @entity35 112.1 69.7 @entity41 90 11.3 7.0 @entity77 90 11.3 7.0 @entity39 90 11.8 6.7 even when @entity35 were forced into a defensive reshuffle , they were untroubled throughout a first half dominated by @entity87 ’ side			1
@entity71 succumbed to injury after nine minutes and was replaced by @entity72			0
@entity74 was substituted for @entity75 after 26			0
moments later , @entity35 scored again			1
this defence needs sorting out because the goal @entity41 scored was too easy			1
@entity80 bounced through unchallenged , into the danger zone and placed the ball into the path of @entity41 for the @entity35 forward to finish off the job			1
by this time it was borderline embarrassing			0
apart from the scoreline , @entity13 ’ contribution to the first half was a long range effort from @entity57 that hit the side - netting			1
seriously , that was it			0
there are rumblings of discontent around these parts and it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect @entity30			0
his team , who fluked a win at @entity210 last weekend after @entity211 was dismissed , were hopelessly under - prepared for @entity35			2
even @entity63 - ‘ he is one of us ’ as they sing - could n’t get going , try as he might			0
sadly for @entity63 , @entity35 ’s giant of a centre half @entity73 handled him impeccably			2
the kid hardly got a kick			0
they hardly had a shot either , barely registering an effort after a half - time team talk that excluded @entity60 and @entity58			0
@entity35 goalkeeper @entity70 is booked by referee @entity91 for time - wasting during the first half the view from behind the goal as @entity41 puts the ball past @entity50 to double @entity35 's lead @entity41 is given a pat on the head by @entity35 's congratulator - in - chief @entity39 after putting his side two up @entity57 ( centre ) tries to burst upfield and make something happen for the hosts during a frustrating first half @entity236 ( centre ) drags the ball wide of the goal under pressure from three @entity35 players @entity62 leathers the ball past @entity70 to give @entity13 some sort of lifeline @entity236 celebrates after his volley with 12 minutes to go halved @entity35 's lead and gave @entity13 hope @entity59 ( left ) and @entity63 ( centre ) show their despair as a chance goes begging near the end @entity51 legs up @entity79 with seven minutes to go and is sent off for a professional foul referee @entity91 ( second right ) waves the red card and @entity51 ( left ) is off down the tunnel spurs have lost four @entity34 home matches in five for the first time since may - october 2008 ( @entity259 ’ last five home @entity34 games as manager )			1
@entity13 0 - 3 @entity263 ; @entity13 0 - 1 @entity264 ; @entity13 1 - 2 @entity265 ; @entity13 1 - 2 @entity35 @entity59 ’s free - kick 15 minutes from time brought a flying save from @entity70 , launching himself to the left to turn it around the post			1
@entity62 gave them hope when he picked the ball out of the air to beat the keeper with an angled volley , but the dismissal of @entity51 confirmed the worst			1
@entity56 wasted a chance when he head wide of @entity70 ’s post and @entity63 ’s desperate attempts to repeat his last minute free - kick against @entity210 last week was drilled straight at the wall			0
that was enough for @entity6 and the rest of the @entity23 delegation to make their excuses and leave			0
whether he can face returning is another matter			0
@entity13 full back @entity37 seemed to be struggling to breathe during the second half rose on his haunches as he is clearly struggling during the second half @entity54 is attended to by @entity13 's medical team after the final whistle at @entity2 @entity54 ( centre ) leaves the pitch wearing an oxygen mask after the match the @entity35 players applaud as an @entity300 veteran lays a wreath of poppies in the centre circle poppies outside @entity2 before the match to mark @entity306			1

@entity32 gives @entity35 the lead after just six minutes at @entity2 with strike from edge of box
@entity41 doubles lead after diverting in @entity80 's cross
@entity62 scored *superb* volley for @entity13 to make it 2 - 1
