” she did n't say anything , ’ @entity34 recalled the exchange			0

the two formed a bond and continued exchanging phone calls , with @entity8 calling the woman only six years her senior ' @entity67			2
' she was living with her guardian , @entity69 , in @entity9 at the time , but made no mention of that to @entity52			0
their relationship culminated on @entity74 when @entity8 took a train to @entity55 to visit @entity52 , even bringing her a homemade holiday card			0
but over the course of @entity8 ’s visit , @entity52 's sister became suspicious , pointing out to her that the high school sophomore had the body of a grown woman			0

’ truth comes out : on @entity74 , @entity8 ( left ) was photographed with @entity52 , 40 , the head of a @entity55 - based group helping girls , who became suspicious when her sister pointed out that the high school sophomore has the body of a grown woman @entity8 , was arrested monday night - more than six months after she enrolled in @entity105 in @entity9 pretending to be a 15 - year - old orphan			1
according to school officials , ms @entity8 came to @entity105 last october accompanied by a guardian who turned out to be younger than the fake tenth - grader			1
during the enrollment process , @entity8 gave the name @entity22 and indicated that she was 15 years old			1
@entity113 , 30 , who took on the role of @entity8 's guardian last march , told the station @entity27 the bogus teenager told her that she had been abused by her biological father , who has since died along with her mother			2
scam : @entity8 enrolled in @entity105 in @entity9 , @entity5 , last october , claiming she was a home - school student without any prior transcripts the two women met while working together at a @entity123 's located inside the local @entity35 , and @entity8 confided in @entity69 that she had no place to stay after losing her parents			1
@entity84 brought the suspected con artist four years her senior into her home ' as a child , ' bought her clothes and did her hair			2
she even attended parent - teacher conferences to talk about the fake sophomore ’s impressive academic performance			0
' she acted like a kid			0
she got good report cards , ' the 30 - year - old @entity9 resident told @entity59			1
@entity8 ’s web of lies began unraveling when @entity84 got a call from @entity52 , the head of the @entity55 - based charity			2
playing the victim : @entity8 was taken in by a @entity145 after allegedly lying to her that she had been abused as a child and that her parents have died @entity149 doubts : @entity69 ( left ) , @entity8 's guardian , and her mentor , @entity152 ( right ) , became suspicious about her identity and went to police ugly truth : her work file indicted that @entity8 was born in 1979 and that her last name was not @entity22 ms @entity52 told @entity84 that she ran a background check on ' @entity22 , ' which provided more questions than answers			1
@entity84 then decided to make inquires of her own and called a manager at the @entity123 where both she and @entity163 worked			0
the staffer pulled up the high schooler 's file , which indicated that her birth year was 1979 and her real name @entity8			2
on tuesday , @entity84 and the phony orphan ’s mentor , @entity152 , alerted police to the alleged fraud before heading over to the high school			0
‘ teachers were crying and students were crying , and her best friend just could n't believe it , ’ @entity84 said			0
school officials said @entity8 came in last october as a home - schooled student without any prior transcripts			1
officers who responded to @entity84 ’s @entity9 home monday night asked @entity8 to identify herself , and in response she gave them the name @entity22 – the same moniker used on her school application			1
sticking to her ruse : hours before her arrest monday night , @entity8 posted this photo of her posing with a horse stature under the @entity193 user name @entity194 sob story : ms @entity8 told @entity84 , her co-worker at a @entity123 's who is four years her senior , that she had lost both her parents and had no place to live online persona : on @entity200 and @entity201 , @entity8 called herself ' @entity202 ' and shared photos of herself looking like a teenager the woman has been charged with failure to identify / giving false , fictitious information			1
she remains in the @entity208 on $ 500 bond			0
looking at @entity8 ’s fake @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity193 account created under the nickname @entity213 , it is easy to understand how those around her could have bought in to her tale of woes			0
in the photos posted online , @entity8 looks like a shy , fresh - faced girl with a pink bow in her neatly combed hair and sparkly manicure			2
however , in her booking photo , @entity8 dressed in a striped jail garb looks not a day younger than her 34 years , with a lined , puffy face and a tangle of hair .			2
