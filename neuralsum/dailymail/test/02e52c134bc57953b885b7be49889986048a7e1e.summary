@entity1 team principal @entity0 has revealed to using a carrot - and - stick method with @entity3 to keep his desire to remain with the @entity6 marque high			1
with @entity8 yet to sign his new contract as he negotiates the finer details with @entity11 , it has been suggested that the 30 - year - old will replace @entity3 at @entity1 for next season			1
the @entity14 , however , has arguably never been happier during his @entity17 career courtesy of the atmosphere generated within the team by the arrival of the charismatic @entity0			2
@entity8 celebrates his victory at the @entity22 ahead of the @entity1 of @entity3 @entity3 shakes hands with @entity8 in parc ferme after finishing behind the race winner in @entity26 last week @entity0 urged @entity3 to raise his game in the wake of an indifferent start to the campaign , certainly compared with team - mate @entity31			1
in sunday 's @entity22 , @entity3 did exactly that , finishing on the podium for the first time in 26 grands prix as runner - up to @entity8			1
the performance naturally resulted in @entity0 being asked as to @entity3 's chances of staying , given he has an option on his deal for next year , but also whether @entity1 were interested in @entity40			1
@entity0 said : ' does @entity8 call you ? because he never calls me			1
every driver here in the paddock wants to drive for @entity1 , this is normal , even guys that were quite a lot of the time world champion			2
' i 'm happy with the drivers we have , but this does not mean i am going to sign with @entity3 tomorrow			2
@entity54 duels for position with @entity31 heading into @entity56 during sunday 's race in @entity26 @entity3 , the 2007 world champion , celebrates his first podium finish since the @entity59 ' we are very clear , i repeat again : i said to @entity3 , ' look , it depends on your performance ' and he has demonstrated he 's a great driver			1
' so if you ask me now " does he deserve to renew the option ? " i am going to say yes			0
but if i am going to say yes , i do n't want the driver to fall asleep			0
i want to keep him awake			0
@entity3 is at his best when he is in a bit in trouble			2
this is a psychological approach			0
so the paper ( the contract ) at the moment is white			0
sometimes i have to take the pen , then take it back			0
' @entity3 produced his best performance of the season to finish second behind @entity8 although @entity3 managed to split @entity11 duo @entity8 and @entity54 , with @entity31 down in fifth , it was not the result practice had suggested as @entity1 appeared stronger on long - run pace than @entity11			1
@entity0 knows @entity1 still have plenty of work to do if they are to keep pace with @entity11 on a regular basis			2
' we put together an aggressive strategy , which is exactly what we discussed , ' added @entity0			0
' we recognise the gap we have to @entity11 , so the only way is to be aggressive , even though at this stage you can make a mistake if you are aggressive			0
' if one day we are able to catch them , of course the strategy must be put together in a way that is a bit different			0
