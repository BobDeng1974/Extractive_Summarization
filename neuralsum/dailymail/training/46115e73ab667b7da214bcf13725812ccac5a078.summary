a thoughtful husband has given his wife a birthday present she will never forget - after commissioning 23 artists to create works of art of his family			1
@entity8 came up with the idea for the unique gift after discovering a community of artists on the website @entity13			1
determined to give his wife , @entity15 , something special , @entity8 contacted between 45 and 50 artists who had some of the most successful submissions on the site			1
@entity8 , whose nine - month - old son @entity23 would also feature in the pictures , said he liked all of their works so much he could n't turn them down			2
as an amateur photographer , @entity8 , 33 , decided to send the artists a selection of 40 pictures of his family , allowing them to choose which they would like to work with			2
over a period of a few months , the images kept coming in			0
when her birthday came around , @entity8 treated @entity15 , now 34 , to a three - hour - long spa treatment - allowing him to hang the works on the wall while she was out			1
@entity68 ' reaction was one of shock , with @entity8 filming her response and later putting it on @entity72 for friends and family to see			2
mr @entity8 , an amateur photographer , found the artists on website @entity13 , and after initially asking the group if anyone was interested , was surprised when submissions kept coming in over a period of several months mr @entity8 's nine - month - old son @entity23 became the star of the show - and featured in the majority of the pieces the artists chose from 40 pictures altogether , such as this cute image of @entity23 resting on his mother 's belly after receiving the final artworks back from the artists , mr @entity8 hung them around the house for his wife mr @entity8 , 33 , said : ' i was worried about not finishing it in time , but luckily it all worked out ' one of the artists chose to recreate this picture of @entity15 and @entity23 in hospital just after he was born mr @entity8 sent a selection of adorable pictures to the artists , including this one of nine - month - old @entity23 he then waited over a period of several months for the artists ' own creations to be returned to him @entity23 features in the majority of the artworks , which were given to his surprised mother on her birthday mr @entity8 said the response to his idea from his family and friends has been overwhelmingly positive the idea to approach the artists was a ' light bulb moment ' , according to mr @entity8			1

' honestly , i was worried about not finishing it in time , but luckily it all worked out			0
' the response has been overwhelmingly positive from friends and family			0
