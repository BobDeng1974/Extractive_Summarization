@entity0 will try to forget that he is on home soil as he looks to make the @entity2 his third victory in succession this week			1
@entity5 produced a flawless closing 65 to win the @entity7 at @entity8 on sunday , a fortnight after winning the @entity10 on the @entity11			1
it is the first time in his career that @entity5 has won consecutive events and the 33 - year - old knows making it a hat - trick will be a massive ask at @entity18 giving his previous @entity7 record			2
double delight ? @entity0 is aiming to win the @entity2 after victory at the @entity7 perfect preparation : @entity5 celebrates on the 18th green at @entity8 after triumphing with a round of 65 since famously finishing fourth as a 17 - year - old amateur in 1998 , @entity5 has not recorded another top - 10 finish in 11 attempts , missing the cut in three of the last four years			1
but perhaps there is a good omen in the fact that @entity32 was the last player to make a major championship his third consecutive victory , winning the @entity7 the last time it was staged at @entity18 in 2006 , then adding the @entity35 and the @entity36 in a run of seven straight strokeplay wins that season			2
' i 've tried to see it as my home major and i am not paying attention to that now , ' @entity5 said			1
' a major is a major			2
' if @entity32 is playing the @entity48 he does n't think , " this is my home major " , it 's just another major championship			1
from that perspective i am just trying to deflect any extra pressure and although my recent @entity7 record is not good , i do take confidence from @entity54 in 2009 for example			2
' even though the record book wo n't suggest it [ he finished 13th ] , i was right in the hunt there			0
i played beautiful golf that week , good enough to win and i know that			0
there 's been a few occasions where i 've had good runs and a few occasions where i 've been on the bad side of the draw			0
' if you go out and play wonderful golf you can make up for the draw , but if you are sort of borderline the draw can make a big difference too			0
i am trying not to pay too much attention to it ( my record ) but i have played great links golf in my career in different times so i just have to put it all together next week			0
' on form : @entity5 's win in @entity83 came after his victory in the @entity10 on the @entity11 he 's got previous : @entity5 is hoping to add a second major title to his collection after winning the 2013 @entity48 @entity5 already has one major trophy in his cabinet thanks to last year 's @entity48 triumph at @entity93 and added : ' i 've got a nice trophy case with varying sizes to fit all options so hopefully there will be more			1
i 'll build a new house if need be			0
that wo n't be a problem			0
' and he has been backed to add more trophies to his collection by the man he beat into second place at @entity93 and who performed the @entity7 - @entity2 double 12 months ago			1
' prior to last year i think everybody would rule him out because he won the week before			0
but now that it 's been done , and somebody has won the week before and followed it up with the @entity2 , i think it 's an advantage , ' @entity108 said			1
' i think it 's an advantage to play the @entity7 on links golf , get acclimated to the time over here , get acclimated to seeing the ball bounce , and the fescue and thicker grasses on the greens and long lag putts that we are going to have , and putting in crosswinds			2
' all those things happened last week and gives the players that played a distinct advantage			0
and the fact that he 's playing well , he 's going to be in contention			0
' faith : @entity108 , pictured here during a practice round at @entity18 , believes @entity5 has a chance in @entity135			1

the *143rd* @entity2 takes place at @entity138 this week
@entity5 is aiming to following up his victory at the @entity7 with a second major title
the 2013 @entity48 champion says he will not think of the event as his home major
