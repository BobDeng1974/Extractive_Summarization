' i 'm not spending nearly as much time trying to think through every twist and turn , i 'm not preparing nearly quite as methodically as last time , ' he told reporters on his bright yellow battlebus			0
' the longer i 've been in politics the more i think you can over-think these things			0
and it will be very different - there 'll be seven of us			2
' the last time nobody knew who i was , so i had nothing to lose			0
in a sense this time i dont have much to lose either , as everyone appears to have their mind made up one way or the other			0
' i 'm not going to triumph in these debates - that 's just self - evident			2
what i learnt about the debates with @entity13 is you might marshal the best arguments but if there are people who play better to the gallery they are going to do well			0
' i 've been in politics long enough to know its not a beauty contest and it tends to be the case that newcomers or people not well known to the public tend to do best , so i enter with quite sober realistic expectations			0
but i intend to enjoy it			0
in the driving seat : @entity6 today climbed behind the wheel of the 2 millionth mini off a production line in @entity154 ' i 'm not disillusioned , i think you just have to keep what debates can and cant do in perspective			0
