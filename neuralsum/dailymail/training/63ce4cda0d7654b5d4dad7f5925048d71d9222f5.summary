@entity0 has blamed ' low blows ' , ' betrayals ' and ' back - stabbing ' for her break - up from @entity4 last weekend			1
speaking in @entity5 , where she is currently touring children 's hospitals , @entity0 claimed that she had no desire to become @entity9 and that she would have dated @entity4 even if he had not won the election			1
she added that the ambition to become elected was @entity4 's alone , and that she now feels ' liberated ' from a life in power and is looking forward to returning to a normal existence			2
' @entity4 apparently called her on the first day of her trip to @entity24 , where she launched a charity in defiance of @entity53 staff , and again after a press conference yesterday when she stressed their relationship would not be rekindled			1
@entity0 has also confirmed that she will not be returning to the ' cynicism ' of political journalism following the split , and instead plans to launch a career as a humanitarian campaigner			1
yesterday she visited sick children at the @entity64 children 's hospital in @entity24 in a visit that echoed much of the humanitarian work that earned princess @entity67 the nickname ' @entity69 ' following her divorce from prince @entity71 in 1996			1
ambition : @entity0 has said she never wanted to become @entity9 and that she would have dated @entity4 whether he had become president or not humanitarian : she says she has no desire to return to the ' cynical ' world of political journalism and will instead become a humanitarian campaigner treacherous : @entity0 also blamed ' backstabbing ' and ' betrayals ' for her split from president @entity4 on speaking terms : @entity4 has apparently phoned @entity0 every day since he announced their split ms @entity0 yesterday visited a children 's hospital in @entity24 flanked by a single bodyguard , right love rivals : ms @entity0 , left , has herself just spent eight days in a @entity90 hospital suffering from the stress of finding out mr @entity4 , 59 , was having an affair with the actress @entity93 , 41 , pictured , right , at the @entity95 jewellery launch in @entity90 - her first official engagement following revelations of the affair asked if she was particularly proud of anything during her relatively short time as first lady , ms @entity0 said : ‘ i do n't know if it 's for me to judge , or for you			1
‘ i was there for 19 months			0
i was able to meet people i did n’t know before			0
i understood that you can be useful , and in being useful to others you can be useful to yourself			0
’ ‘ it is very touching to see these babies weighing less than a kilogramme and with very limited life chances , ’ said ms @entity0			2
‘ it ’s an injustice because even if everything is done to make them better , they do n’t have the same facilities as in our hospitals			0
’ back to business : meanwhile , @entity16 president @entity4 met with @entity119 president @entity118 in @entity120 , @entity119 , on monday during a two day visit to an economic forum bringing the two countries together @entity4 walks behind soldiers laying a wreath at the mausoleum of @entity127 in @entity120 timing : president @entity4 visit coincided with a political crisis plaguing the @entity119 government and turmoil in his own private life proud : earlier in the day she refused to answer questions about her turbulent private life and , dressed in a navy blue jacket and skirt , looked distinctly calm and unemotional fired : mr @entity4 officially ' fired ' ms @entity0 on saturday – signalling the end of her 10 months as a first lady in a curt 18 word statement			1
when asked today what she would do now , she said she did n't know but told journalists : ' do n't worry about me ' ms @entity0 has herself just spent eight days in a @entity90 hospital suffering from the extreme stress of finding out that mr @entity4 , 59 , was having an affair with the actress @entity93 , 41			2
looking distinctly calm and unemotional , mrs @entity0 denied claims that her trip was an unnecessary strain on @entity16 tax payers ’ money , saying : ‘ you see , you ca n’t say i ’m wasting public money , i ’ve only got a bodyguard ’			2
in fact , @entity162 , her ex chief of staff , is also on the trip , and she said of ms @entity0 : ‘ she has not become an ordinary citizen , she is an ex first lady , which gives her a different status			0
’ mr @entity4 officially ‘ fired ’ ms @entity0 on saturday – signalling the end of her time as first lady in a curt 18 word statement			2
the @entity172 magazine journalist ’s charity trip to @entity5 will certainly be the last she enjoys with all the trappings of a vip dignitary			0
' @entity175 ' : determined to portray herself as a @entity16 ' @entity175 ' in the tradition of the @entity67 , ms @entity0 posed for pictures with patients at the @entity64 children 's hospital in @entity24 raising awareness : ms @entity0 is in @entity5 for a two - day trip to raise awareness about child malnutrition mr @entity4 has made it clear that he wants her to return to ordinary life , staying away from the @entity53 and living in the modest flat they once shared in @entity90 ’s unfashionable 15th arrondissement			1
friends have indicated that she wants financial compensation from the president , who fears that she will turn into a loose cannon who could damage him			0
mr @entity4 , who had never married , is now expected to remain a ‘ bachelor president ’ for a while , while continuing with his relationship with ms @entity93 outside the @entity53			0
ms @entity93 has not spoken since the pictures were published of mr @entity4 leaving their @entity90 love nest on the back of a moped , while using a crash helmet as a poor disguise .			0
