paraded : defendants in the cages of the @entity36 courtroom at a previous hearing			0
defendants include ( left to right ) student @entity39 , and @entity12 journalists @entity13 , @entity41 and @entity42 @entity44 journalist and former @entity14 correspondent @entity13 stands inside a cage during the trial , where he called accusations that he was supporting a terrorist group ' preposterous ' defence lawyers and even the judge dismissed the videos as irrelevant , while @entity13 shouted from a cage in the @entity36 courtroom : ' this is a complete joke			1
' none of the clips appeared to have any connection to terrorism , and none of them were @entity12 footage			0
' this clearly does not contain anything supporting the case , ' said presiding judge @entity64 after the footage was aired			1
@entity66 , @entity41 's lawyer , mocked the prosecutors and claimed they had not watched the footage before submitting it as evidence			2
the three journalists - @entity13 , @entity73 - @entity3 acting bureau chief @entity72 and @entity3 @entity74 - have been detained since december 29 last year			2
@entity39 , left , a student who is charged with helping three @entity12 journalists falsify news accounts about @entity3 , wore a t - shirt whose @entity79 inscription read ' @entity80 in @entity3 's @entity81 ' the three journalists were arrested after the military backed government of @entity3 declared the @entity17 a terrorist organisation , in their @entity36 hotel where they had set up a temporary office they are accused of being part of a terrorist group and airing falsified footage to damage @entity3 national security			1
@entity3 authorities accuse @entity93 - owned network @entity12 of providing a platform for the @entity17 , which the government has branded a terrorist organisation			1
@entity12 denies the claim , and the defendants deny being members of the @entity17 , saying they were simply doing their job reporting on @entity3 's political turmoil			1

protest : hundreds of @entity14 employees demonstrated outside the @entity112 's @entity111 headquarters on monday to mark 100 days since the arrest of the three journalists , including a former @entity14 correspondent anger : @entity13 worked for the @entity14 in @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 ' i want to get out of this place ... i am going to expose all of this , ' he shouted			0
' there are crimes against humanity taking place			0

' besides the three journalists , 17 others are charged in the case , but only five are present and the rest are being tried in their absence			2

' what the @entity3 authorities are doing is vindictive persecution of journalists for merely doing their jobs ' - @entity19 shortly after the court session started today , one of the other defendants , @entity144 , collapsed after complaining he had been in hunger strike because he was being denied medical care and visitors in prison			1
dozens of defendants in several @entity17 - related cases have gone on hunger strike over similar conditions			2

' so far , the @entity171 has failed to produce any convincing evidence and the journalists appear to be pawns in the hands of the authorities in their ongoing dispute with @entity93			0
' the truth is that @entity41 , @entity13 and @entity178 are prisoners of conscience who must be released immediately and unconditionally			0
in an unusual move , the judge , @entity64 , eventually allowed the defendants to approach the bench to deliver their pleas in a previous hearing ' this trial is nothing more than posturing by the authorities to gain public support			1
' this farce must end and the charges against the three men must be dropped			0
' @entity13 worked for the @entity14 in @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , and has won awards for his work			0
@entity44 journalist @entity13 had only been in the country for two weeks before being arrested the 45 - year - old @entity44 , who works for @entity199 tv channel @entity12 , describes the charges as ‘ preposterous ’ and an international campaign has been launched to secure his release			0
the defendents have previously been asked to be released on bail but the judge denied their request			0
at a previous hearing mr @entity13 told the judge he had been in @entity3 for only two weeks before his arrest			2

’ @entity218 bureau chief @entity41 , who holds dual @entity73 - @entity3 citizenship , also denied links to the @entity17 , saying he was an alcohol - drinking liberal who had lived abroad for a long time			1
‘ have you ever heard of a @entity17 terrorist that drinks alcohol ? ’ he asked			0
other defendants claimed they had been abused and tortured during interrogation			0
mr @entity13 ’s parents had hoped he would be released after @entity44 prime minister @entity229 took up the case with interim @entity3 president @entity231			2
