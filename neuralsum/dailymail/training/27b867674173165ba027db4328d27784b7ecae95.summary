by @entity0 a degenerative eye disease slowly robbed @entity2 of his vision			1
diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa as a teenager , @entity2 has been almost completely blind for years			1
now , thanks to a high - tech procedure that involved the surgical implantation of a ' bionic eye , ' he 's regained enough of his eyesight to catch small glimpses of his wife , grandson and cat			1
it 's exciting — seeing something new every day , ' @entity2 said during a recent appointment at the @entity19			1
the visual information then moves to the brain , where it is translated into patterns of light that can take the shape of an object 's outline , allowing the patient to regain some visual function the 55 - year - old former competitive weightlifter and factory worker is one of four people in the @entity27 to receive an artificial retina since the @entity28 signed off on its use last year			1
the facility in @entity25 has been the site of all four such surgeries since @entity28 approval			0
a fifth is scheduled for next month			0
retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease that causes slow but progressive vision loss due to a gradual loss of the light - sensitive retinal cells called rods and cones			2
patients experience loss of side vision and night vision , then central vision , which can result in near blindness			2
not all of the 100,000 or so people in the @entity27 with retinitis pigmentosa can benefit from the bionic eye			1
an estimated 10,000 have vision low enough , said dr. @entity75 , an executive with @entity76 , the @entity77 , @entity78 - based company that makes the device			2
of those , about 7,500 are eligible for the surgery			0
technology : the glasses are part of a system developed by a @entity78 company that wirelessly transmits images from the camera , converted into a series of electrical pulses , to an array of electrodes on the surface of @entity2 ' retina @entity95 : dr. @entity96 , left , looks at @entity2 's left eye as @entity2 's wife , @entity98 , right , looks on			1
the artificial implant that currently resides in @entity101 s left eye is called the @entity102 , and is part of the system developed by a @entity78 company that includes a small video camera and transmitter housed in a pair of glasses the artificial implant in @entity2 's left eye is part of a system developed by @entity76 that includes a small video camera and transmitter housed in a pair of glasses			1
images from the camera are converted into a series of electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes on the surface of the retina			0
the pulses stimulate the retina 's remaining healthy cells , causing them to relay the signal to the optic nerve			0
the visual information then moves to the brain , where it is translated into patterns of light that can be recognized and interpreted , allowing the patient to regain some visual function			0
when wearing the glasses , which @entity2 refers to as his ' eyes , ' he can identify and grab his cat and figure out that a flash of light is his grandson hightailing it to the kitchen			2
the visual improvement is sometimes startling for @entity2 and his wife , @entity144 , who is just as amazed at her husband 's progress as he is			2
' i said something i never thought i 'd say : ' stop staring at me while i 'm eating , ' @entity98 said			0
she drives her husband the nearly 200 miles from tiny @entity150 , @entity151 , to @entity25 for check - ups and visits with occupational therapist @entity154 , who helps @entity2 reawaken his visual memory and learn techniques needed to make the most of his new vision			1
seeing is believing : images from the camera are converted into a series of electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes on the surface of the retina learning to see : dr. @entity167 , right , works with @entity2 , left , on an exercise to test how well he sees shapes on a computer screen			1
@entity2 suffers from a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa and is the second patient in the @entity27 to surgically receive a ' bionic eye ' at the recent visit , @entity154 handed @entity2 white and black plates , instructed him to move them back and forth in front of light and dark backgrounds and asked that he determine their color			1
back home , @entity98 helps her husband practice the techniques he learns in @entity25			0
for them , the long hours on the road and the homework assignments are a blessing			0
' what 's it worth to see again ? it 's worth everything , ' @entity98 said			0
the artificial retina procedure has been performed several - dozen times over the past few years in @entity195 , and the expectation is that it will find similar success in the @entity27 , where the @entity19 is one of 12 centers accepting consultations for patients			1
candidates for the retinal prosthesis must be 25 or older with end - stage retinitis pigmentosa that has progressed to the point of having ' bare light ' or no light perception in both eyes			0
dr. @entity96 , one of two physicians who performed the 4.5 - hour surgery on @entity2 , is scheduled to discuss his experiences with the retinal prosthesis process during a meeting of the @entity214 and @entity215 on friday in @entity216			2
he calls it a ' game - changer			0
' @entity2 agrees : ' i can walk through the house with ease			2
if that 's all i get out of this , it 'd be great			0

@entity27 patient @entity2 has been blind for years
he has now had some of his vision *restored* thanks to a bionic eye
the eye gives those the *ability* to see shadows and shapes
