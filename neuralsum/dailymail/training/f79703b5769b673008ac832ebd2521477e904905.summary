president @entity2 no longer has a viable national security strategy due to funding and troop cuts , a new report by @entity1 claims the @entity7 military has become so depleted by cuts that it has been left only ' marginally able ' to defend the nation			1
decreases in the number of soldiers and naval ships have led to armed forces falling short of president @entity2 's national security strategy , a report by @entity1 claimed			1
@entity2 's aim was to ensure that the country could still fight two major conflicts at once			2
but the @entity21 report , released by the think tank on tuesday , said that with current funding this would be problematic			1
the report said : ' the consistent decline in funding and the consequent shrinking of the @entity29 are putting it under significant pressure			0
' the cumulative effect of such factors has resulted in a @entity7 military that is marginally able to meet the demands of defending @entity7 's vital national interests			1
' the @entity37 announced last year that the @entity29 would be cut from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000 - the fewest since @entity39 the @entity29 historically commits 21 brigade combat teams to one war but would struggle to do this and leave reserves if there were two simultaneous conflicts , the report said			1
it added that the @entity48 would need another 62 ships to be able to carry out two large campaigns			0
however the @entity52 â€™s fleet is judged ' strong '			0
@entity53 , a @entity54 analyst and former @entity56 officer , said : ' the @entity7 military itself is ageing			1
it 's shrinking in size			0
' it 's quickly becoming problematic in terms of being able to address more than one major conflict			0
a @entity7 solider is pictured ( above ) at @entity70 's @entity69 march near the @entity72 border on tuesday the @entity29 historically commits 21 brigade combat teams to one war but would struggle to do this and leave reserves if there were two simultaneous conflicts , the report said			1
@entity7 soldiers ( above ) are pictured in @entity82 armoured vehicles after joining the parade in @entity70 earlier this week @entity84 , member of the @entity85 , said the report 's findings were stark			1
he said : ' it paints a stark picture of shortfalls in capability , capacity and readiness across the force , and illustrates the damage done by years of irresponsible budget cuts			0
' if you listen to the @entity29 , they will give testimony that they can no longer guarantee			0
you talk about two wars - they testified they ca n't guarantee that we could win one war			2
' the @entity48 will tell you if we get to 260 ships , we cease to be a superpower - we become a regional power			2
the @entity37 announced last year that the @entity29 would be cut from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000 - the fewest since @entity110 soldiers are pictured ( above ) on exercise in @entity112 , @entity113 , in 2013 ' i encourage all policy - makers interested in the current state of our military , and how to improve it , to review this @entity21			2
' under @entity2 the @entity121 's base budget , minus overseas war costs , has decreased from $ 527 billion in 2010 to around $ 496 billion			0
he is hoping the budget will increase to $ 534 billion in 2016 .			0
