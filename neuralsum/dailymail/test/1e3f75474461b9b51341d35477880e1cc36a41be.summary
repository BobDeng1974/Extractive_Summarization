with its stuffed rhino heads and gleaming white tusks , the trophy room at @entity1 was a relic of a bygone era – as well as rather embarrassing for animal welfare crusader @entity6			2
but now the age of political correctness appears to have caught up with the @entity12 ’s @entity11 estate			1
for every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display and replaced with what one visitor called ‘ trinkets and @entity19 ’			1
throwback : how the trophy room at @entity1 used to look , complete with stuffed rhino heads @entity19 : @entity1 's updated display - and even the blood - red walls have been repainted white all 62 items – including an @entity26 tiger , a leopard , skins and tusks – have been placed in storage			1
even the blood - red walls have been painted white , as if to make clear the break with the past			1
the drastic change was apparent when the estate reopened its doors to the public on saturday			2
following the winter closure , a new sign outside the @entity1 museum makes pointed reference to how changing times have spelled the end for some exhibits			1
after explaining that the museum opened in 1928 to house @entity53 ’s collection of ‘ big game trophies ’ , the message says : ‘ thankfully , due to the work of organisations like the @entity57 , whose president was hrh prince @entity60 until 1996 , this destructive era is drawing to a close – the camera having replaced the gun in recording the sightings of these magnificent animals			2
’ questions were raised in december about the legality of ‘ unworked items ’ – those not fundamentally changed from their natural state – dating from prior to 1947			0
under a @entity71 regulation , the uncarved ivory , stuffed lions and white rhinos all potentially broke the law as they were not on show with an official certificate			0
the @entity76 – an arm of the @entity78 – confirmed there was a ‘ potential legal question mark ’ about some of the contents of the room			0
@entity85 era : the room , which featured stuffed lions , must have been embarrassing for animal welfare crusader @entity6 chnging times : now every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display the situation was particularly embarrassing for @entity6 , who had just denounced the illegal wildlife trade in ivory , rhino horn and endangered animal parts during a speech in @entity97 he had also previously called for the @entity99 ’s ivory collection to be destroyed			1
and the royals now appear to have taken decisive action by removing the items from display – but whether their replacements are particularly interesting is another matter entirely			2
the new items include an ashtray used by @entity53 , a @entity109 badge dating from 1895 and an embroidered cover of @entity111 that marked the wedding of @entity113 and lady @entity114			0
an ornate cabinet of ‘ curios ’ from a primary school on the estate contains dolls , jewellery made from oyster shells and a dried puffer fish			0
the only other creatures to be found are stuffed birds in a glass cabinet and a butterfly collection			0
one visitor who went along to @entity1 on saturday said : ‘ every last animal head , stuffed animal or skin has gone			2
gone : all 62 items – including an @entity26 tiger , a leopard , skins and tusks – have been placed in storage ‘ there ’s a real mixed bag now of bizarre and random things			1
someone has come in and taken everything out of there , whitewashed the place and put in an entire room of trinkets and @entity19			0
’ a spokesman for @entity147 said yesterday that the trophies had been put away to make room for an exhibition of paintings by members of the @entity153 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 royal families			0
he added : ‘ changes were made to the @entity1 museum during the winter closure as part of an ongoing process of updating and refreshing the displays			1
’ a source said the legality of around five items had been questioned although those in charge of the collection were ‘ still sure ’ they had not broken the law .			0
