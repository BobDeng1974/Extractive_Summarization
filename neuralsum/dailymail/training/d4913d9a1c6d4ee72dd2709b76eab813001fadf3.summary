published : 07:10 est , 16 may 2014 updated : 09:02 est , 16 may 2014 the @entity1 has lift - off on friday as the renamed and revamped competition starts across the country			1
fourteen of the 18 counties begin their 2014 @entity7 campaigns and to celebrate the start of this year 's version , the @entity4 have launched a cricket ball into space from @entity12			1
there will , of course , be plenty of batsmen looking to do the same , including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , and the runs are set to flow this summer			2
out of the park : the ball sailing over @entity12 after being launched into space out of this world : the ball hovers over the planet - even @entity27 would struggle to hit it that far ! @entity30 v @entity29 ( 5.30pm ) @entity32 v @entity31 ( 5.30 ) @entity34 v @entity33 ( 5.30 ) @entity36 v @entity35 ( 5.30 ) @entity38 v @entity37 ( 6.30 ) @entity40 v @entity39 ( 7.0 ) @entity42 v @entity41 ( 7.0 ) saturday @entity44 v @entity43 ( noon ) @entity44 v @entity45 's ( 4.0pm ) @entity37 v @entity29 ( 7.0 ) there could be another big - hitting , fast - bowling addition as @entity49 looks set to rejoin @entity37 for the competition - if he can prove his fitness in the seconds			1
most of this year 's matches will take place on friday nights in an attempt to maximise attendances and there will be musical accompaniment following the @entity4 's quest to find supporters ' favourite songs			2
the players certainly seem to be looking forward to the competition starting , with many of them going on @entity68 to express their excitement			0
@entity37 's @entity70 , involved in the first live tv match of the tournament at @entity38 , possibly put it best with the succinct message : ' t20 is here let the slogging start ! ' the pinnacle of the @entity7 season is , of course , @entity79 day and this year it is at @entity12 on august 23			1
northants are the holders after their victory over @entity41 last year			0
the race to topple them starts on friday			0
players and fans will have a blast			0
they 're going to have a blast : representatives from each of the 18 counties with the trophy for more information on @entity94 , visit @entity96			0
