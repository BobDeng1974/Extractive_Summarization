a series of ' secret lunches ' have been held by @entity2 , a former @entity6 donor now trying to coax mps to join @entity3			1
the revelation comes as the two parties continue a war of words over a mooted electoral pact and the fall - out from the decision by @entity23 council to remove three foster children from a couple because they were @entity3 members			2
mr @entity2 , a spread - betting tycoon , said he had agreed to keep the @entity5 ' names secret but had passed on their details to @entity3 leader @entity29			1
‘ i have had lunch , secretly if you like , in a completely confidential way with eight different @entity5 , ' he told the @entity34			0

@entity6 vice-chairman @entity41 had urged the @entity42 to strike a deal with @entity3 , arguing it could help the @entity45 pick up 20 seats at the next election			1
but party chairman @entity47 moved to kill off the idea , saying the party would ' categorically ' not do a deal with the smaller party			1
and @entity3 leader @entity29 said he would only consider a deal if the @entity45 ousted mr @entity53 as leader			1
his party has been angered by mr @entity53 's decision to reignite a row about comments he made in 2006 in which he described the party 's members as ' fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists , mostly '			2
mr @entity29 said : ' if @entity53 went and somebody pragmatic , grown up and sensible like @entity66 was leader , you might think then we could sit around the table and have a proper discussion			2
' it 's very difficult for us to believe anything @entity53 says because , after all , he gave us a cast - iron guarantee that we 'd have a referendum [ on the @entity75 ] and it has n't happened			0
' @entity6 party chairman @entity47 ( left ) put and end to the idea floated by vice-chairman @entity41 ( right ) that the @entity6 should join forces with @entity3 mr @entity41 had warned that @entity3 had become ' a significant contributory factor in costing the @entity6 victories in marginal seats '			1
but he sparked controversy after suggesting that some @entity45 were racist while trying to defend his pact idea			0

in return @entity3 would agree not to field candidates against the @entity45 at the next election			0
but mr @entity47 said : ' i want to win the next election outright of course for the conservatives so that we have an outright majority and do n't have to be in coalition			0
but i want to do that with @entity6 candidates fighting and winning on their own ground and on their terms and that is exactly what we are going to do			0
' mr @entity29 said there would be ' no deals with the @entity45 – it 's war			1
' @entity3 is not a racist party and yet mr @entity53 , the prime minister , basically repeated his unpleasant allegation that he made about us in 2006			2
' so the real obstacle to any deal with the @entity6 is the @entity6 leader			0
' mr @entity41 played down the row , suggesting there were ' closet racists ' in all parties			1
