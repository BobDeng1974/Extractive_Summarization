gunfire rang out and buildings were set ablaze in @entity2 this morning as the @entity4 capital witnessed a battle that left at least 10 policemen and nine militants dead			1
more than six hours after fighting broke out , @entity4 leader @entity8 said a multi-story building the militants had occupied in central @entity2 had been destroyed by fire and six gunmen killed			1
he later raised the total number of dead gunmen to nine after several more were found in a city school and an operation launched to ' liquidate ' them			1
several buildings in the city were left devastated by fire			1
but forceful measures have spared @entity2 significant violence for several years			2
security officials and mr @entity8 said militants travelling in several cars killed three traffic police at a checkpoint in @entity2			1
this was disputed by @entity29 state news agency @entity71 , which cited an unidentified law enforcement source as saying five police officers were killed			2
an @entity75 reporter saw the building - a publishing house - in flames and heard the sound of heavy - calibre gunfire before dawn , several hours after the unrest erupted			1
the @entity75 reporter also saw the body of someone in civilian clothing in the street near the publishing house as fighting continued			1
it was not clear how and when the person had been killed			2
the @entity92 - based @entity91 , a federal agency , announced it had imposed a counter-terrorism regime on the centre of @entity2			2
this officially allows heightened security measures to be enforced , and typically indicates the imminent use of heavy force to quash unrest			2
@entity100 , a news outlet believed to have links to @entity29 security services , cited police as saying about 15 people had seized three cars late last night in the village of @entity108 and drove to @entity2 , some 30 miles away			0
aftermath : smoke rises from the publishing house as the sun rises on a bleak morning in @entity2 ongoing : @entity4 leader @entity8 said several other gunmen had been found in a city school and an operation was underway to ' liquidate ' them , according to @entity29 news agency @entity116 @entity118 life : local women look at smoke rising from the publishing house mr @entity8 said on his @entity123 account , which he uses to issue public statements , that the traffic police officers were shot dead as they attempted to stop the cars carrying the gunmen			1
in a message posted several hours later , mr @entity8 said that six militants were killed in the standoff at the publishing house			1
' not one bandit managed to get out			0
i directly ran the operation myself , ' he wrote			1
mr @entity8 posted a picture showing the lower half of an apparently dead gunman lying beside a rifle			1
it was not immediately clear if it showed one of the attackers			0
@entity141 , chief of the @entity142 , wrote on @entity143 ' the night attack in @entity2 looks senseless , except as an attempt to embarrass ( @entity29 president @entity146 ) @entity147 hours before his annual address to parliament			0
' mr @entity147 , who is to give his state of the nation address on thursday , already was under pressure to reassure @entity29 as fears grow over soaring inflation and a plummeting ruble			0
a fresh outbreak of violence could further damage mr @entity147 , who has been able to claim success in subduing @entity4 's @entity159 insurgency after years of violence and two full - scale wars			1
but militant jihadist group the @entity163 , which follows a hardline @entity165 @entity159 ideology , has continued to launch attacks despite @entity4 separatists officially ending their armed resistance			2
@entity169 begins : an @entity171 minivan is parked outside the burned publishing house gunfire : @entity174 casings lie on the floor close to the burned out building after the fierce battle this morning more fire : a police car parked outside the burned out market pavilion in central @entity2 clean up job : firefighters and a salesman try to save goods at the burned market pavilion more destruction : a man looks downcast as firefighters tamp down the blaze at the market pavilion upset : two women greet each other outside the burned - out market pavilion as @entity2 woke to devastation solidarity : the women put their arms around each other as they contemplate what they 've lost in the violence in @entity92 : @entity4 regional leader @entity8 , center , talks with the media after @entity29 president @entity147 gave his annual state of the nation address in the @entity202 in @entity92 earlier today the @entity204 website , a mouthpiece for @entity159 militant groups operating in @entity29 's @entity58 , carried a link to a video message by an individual claiming responsibility for the attacks			1
the man in the video claimed to be operating under orders from @entity60 leader @entity215 , known to his followers as emir @entity217			1
a few years after the collapse of the @entity62 , @entity4 was plunged into a full - scale war when separatist rebels pursued independence for the republic			0
the violence was largely confined to that small republic , but rebels ventured into other parts of @entity29			0
a fragile peace settlement was reached with @entity92 until 1999 , when an insurgency movement increasingly inspired by radical @entity60 ideas reignited the conflict			1
a military crackdown succeeded by years of aggressive rule by mr @entity8 has quietened the region , pushing unrest to neighbouring provinces			0
mr @entity8 has been widely denounced for human rights abuses , including allegations of killing opponents			0
he has also imposed some @entity159 restrictions on the region , including mandatory public headscarves for women			0
after two bloody wars and a violent separatist movement , @entity4 has in recent years seen a period of relatively quiet			0
that calm was punctured this morning when a group of gunmen went on the rampage in the @entity29 republic 's capital , shooting dead at least three police officers			1
the @entity4 struggle for independence goes back to the fall of the @entity62 , when local leaders formed an independence movement opposed to @entity258 's vision for a @entity29			2
the @entity259 began in 1994 when @entity29 forces marched in to regain control over @entity4 following a 1991 declaration of independence			0
they faced serious opposition and , despite superiority in numbers and weaponry , and finance from the @entity268 , @entity29 forces were unable to establish control and @entity258 signed a peace treaty in 1997			0
but despite the @entity4 victory , that war displaced nearly half a million people and obliterated the country 's infrastructure , while @entity159 continued their insurgency against the new government			2
in october 1999 the @entity29 army again marched in , responding to an attack by the @entity279 on the neighbouring republic of @entity281 and a string of terror attacks in @entity29 cities , including @entity92			0
this time the invasion was much better planned and executed and , despite continuing terror attacks including the notorious @entity287 , @entity29 public opinion held firm and the @entity202 tightened its grip			0
in 2003 a referendum was held on a new @entity4 constitution reuniting the country with @entity29			0
it was passed with 95.5 per cent of the vote on a claimed turnout of 80 per cent , numbers regarded sceptically by many observers			0
@entity29 finally pulled out in 2009 and ended its counter-terrorism operation			2
three months later the leader of the separatist movement called for a halt for armed resistance			0
@entity60 - inspired attacks continue , however .			1
