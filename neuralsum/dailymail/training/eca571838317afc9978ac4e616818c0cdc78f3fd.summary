even @entity3 , at the end of his tether , would never have come up with something quite as idiotic as the customer relations policy of @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
confronted with a string of complaints on customer ratings website @entity11 from a recent guest , the management could have a ) offered an apology , b ) offered a refund or c ) offered a defence			2
instead , they had a better idea			2
they fined the unhappy customer £ 100			1
in doing so , they have made headlines everywhere from @entity23 to @entity24 , reheated a thousand unkind jokes about @entity7 and ensured that millions of people around the world have now read some of the most excoriating travel reviews this side of @entity30			2
‘ staff drinking cans of @entity53 while serving breakfast , ’ the reviews continued			1
‘ could not wait to get out of this place and get home to bath			2
’ another review , by @entity57 of @entity58 , states : ‘ there was a pair of socks left in the draws [ sic ] that had actually grown mould on them			2
’ a photograph of the offending socks is attached for the world to see			2
indeed , the review which has now made the @entity6 an international laughing stock is not even the worst			1
‘ @entity75 , @entity76 ! ’ begins a detailed critique by @entity71 , of @entity72 in @entity73 , who concludes : ‘ stay away ! ! ! ! ’ but it was his observations , posted on @entity11 at the end of august , which resulted in the subsequent £ 100 penalty by the @entity6 management			1
they simply deducted it from the debit card he had used to settle his bill			0
the @entity6 proudly shows its fading award for 2004 @entity90 hotel of the year , pictured one review stated that the socks left behind in a drawer had actually ' grown mould on them ' , pictured for £ 35 , a guest can stay in a double room , with clean sheets , hot water , free @entity100 and full @entity102 breakfast so here i am checking in to a hotel which , by the sound of it , could not only damage my health but my bank balance , too			1
intriguingly , it ’s by no means the worst hotel in @entity7 ( in the @entity11 rankings it is a mere 858 out of 894 )			0
what ’s more , this is actually the ‘ award - winning ’ @entity6 , having been garlanded with @entity7 ’s @entity113 as recently as 2005			1
and the verdict ? while i have stayed in better , i have definitely stayed in a lot worse			0
the faded décor ca n’t have changed much since @entity117 cracked his first gag at the end of the pier			0
my sea view is obscured by what first appears to be frosted glass and then turns out to be a patina of grime			0
there is no shampoo , let alone soap in my bathroom			0
on the other hand , the sheets are clean , the water is hot , @entity100 is free and the service is attentive			1
and at £ 35 for a double room including a full @entity102 breakfast — less than the cost of a day ’s parking in @entity139 — it ’s certainly competitive			1
another reviewer posted a photograph of an unappealing - looking mattress on @entity11 another reviewer found an area where a ceiling tile had been removed leaving an unattractive gap in the roof one review claimed that staff at the hotel , pictured , were drinking cans of @entity53 while serving breakfast so why has this place become so unpopular ? and will anyone ever stay here again ? the gloss of that 2005 ‘ @entity113 ’ did not last for long			1
the following year , the first bad review popped up on @entity11			0
‘ the staff were so unfriendly , ’ wrote one @entity6 guest			1
‘ the food was horrible , a resident on another table asked for a jug of water , when this arrived it had slithers of glass in it			1
’ the attacks kept on coming			0
lots of hotels have suffered abuse from @entity11 ’s legion of anonymous reviewers			0
but the @entity6 has attracted more than most			1
perhaps the reason mr @entity71 was fined for his harsh words was that he was easily identifiable , having signed his review ‘ @entity179 of @entity72 ’			0
the hotel claimed it was justified in penalising him because the small print on his booking form had stated : ‘ for every bad review left on any website , the group organiser will be charged a maximum £ 100 per review			1
’ guests are treated to a towel fashioned into the shape of a swan - something not on offer at the @entity193 the fraying decor can not have changed much since @entity117 cracked his first joke in @entity7 mr @entity71 complained to his local @entity197 officer , who reported the matter to @entity199			1
a council spokesman tells me that an officer contacted the @entity6 last week and explained that charging unhappy customers was not merely ‘ bad practice ’ but probably illegal			1
the hotel responded by agreeing not to issue any further fines			0
but it was only after this week ’s avalanche of international condemnation that it finally expressed some sort of contrition and issued a prepared statement			0
while not apologising , it promised to refund the @entity215 ’ money , adding : ‘ we agree there is room for improvement at our establishment and we desperately want to turn things around			0
’ clearly , it is a cornerstone of our democracy that people should be free to say what they like , subject to the laws of libel and incitement			2
the @entity6 has behaved like some thin - skinned despot			1
on the other hand , many hotels have reported customers demanding cheap deals on pain of a gratuitously aggressive online review			0
and every hotelier will have stories of the ‘ guests from hell ’			2
the publicity could hardly have come at a worse time since the hotel is also up for sale			2
according to the agents , £ 375,000 will buy you 46 bedrooms , a ‘ @entity249 - themed dining room ’ , sun lounge and a business with a turnover of £ 120,000			1
food was not on offer off - season but guests are encouraged to bring back takeaways and watch tv in the bar a prior guest appears to have had an accident with an iron while preparing for a night out in @entity7 guests have the option of using an old - fashioned @entity265 television in their bedrooms at the hotel but since neither the owners nor the management will discuss the matter any further , the only option is to book a room and see for myself			1
the @entity6 is just a short walk from the rollercoasters of @entity276			1
just over the road , the @entity277 is festooned with @entity280 decorations and echoing to the sound of a coach party singing along to the resident crooner ’s @entity285 repertoire			0
the scene is less jolly at the @entity6			1
despite its transatlantic aspirations , the @entity23 theme does not seem to extend beyond the @entity291 cut - out above the door			2
there is , as yet , no sign of @entity280 , although a leaflet promises a ‘ tinsel and turkey ’ package in the near future			0
but there is a friendly welcome at reception where a young man introduces himself as @entity304 , hands me a key and says i need only ask if i need anything			0
rooms must be paid for up front but the booking form does n’t mention anything about a fine			2
visitors can take part in the friday night karaoke competition where six shots of @entity316 cost £ 10 the @entity6 hotel is currently up for sale for £ 375,000 with an annual turnover of £ 125,000 my first - floor room is just big enough for a double bed			1
there are a couple of rustic prints hanging from peeling peach wallpaper			1
the bathroom seems clean enough			2
indeed , there is a novel touch of sophistication with the towels			0
one of them has been folded in to the shape of a swan and is sitting on the bed			0
you do n’t get that at the @entity193			0
down in the near - empty bar , there are posters for a friday night karaoke competition , along with a special sambuca offer — six shots for a tenner			1
the only entertainment tonight , however , is a television tuned in to the @entity348 channel			0
there ’s no evening food out of season but guests are welcome to bring back takeaways			2
i join three other people watching the news in silence			0
at least two are obviously undercover journalists , while the third is either a travelling salesman or a good actor			0
i sleep well enough but this is no place for early birds as the dining room does n’t open until 8.30am			0
the full @entity102 breakfast is average , edible and no different to the sort of thing you might get at a motorway stop			1
a middle - aged couple arrive and can not speak a single word of @entity102			1
then the woman has a brainwave , produces an @entity373 and contacts an @entity102 - speaking relative via @entity376			1
the relative then shouts back the couple ’s breakfast order to @entity304			2
before i leave i come clean and ask @entity304 what the last few days have been like			2
after all , my experience is certainly different to that of many @entity11 correspondents			0
he says that he is under orders not to comment but insists that the hotel has not undergone any sudden transformation			0
the @entity6 now has more than its online critics to worry about			1
the whole town is furious			0
having enjoyed a bumper summer , with overnight stays up by 30 per cent , @entity7 tourism chiefs are dismayed by all the negative publicity , as yesterday ’s edition of the @entity394 made clear			0
but perhaps , in some strange way , this episode may actually turn around the hotel ’s flagging fortunes			0
people may not only discover that there is a bargain to be had — but there is also the novelty value of staying in a hotel famous for making @entity405 look like the @entity406			0
and the @entity6 is surely a contender for one more award — the public relations disaster of the decade .			1

rooms at the @entity6 in @entity413 are available for £ 35 - a - night
guests get clean sheets , hot water , free @entity100 and a full @entity102 breakfast
they also endure peeling wallpaper , fraying decor and burned *carpets*
however , it is also for sale at a cost of £ 375,000 with a £ *165,000* turnover
it was awarded the title of @entity432 in 2004
