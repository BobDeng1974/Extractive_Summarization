by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 03:08 est , 14 november 2013 social mobility has stalled in @entity3 because young people from modest backgrounds lack aspiration and no longer believe they can make it to the top , @entity1 suggested yesterday			1
endorsing his predecessor sir @entity10 ’s comment that there are too many ‘ posh ’ people in top jobs , he said the @entity15 and the professions need to move ‘ further and faster ’ to change that			1
mr @entity1 said it was ‘ not enough ’ to provide children from poor families with ‘ equality of opportunity ’ , as so many are not confident enough to seize the chances presented to them			1
sir @entity10 , who rose from a council estate to @entity25 , said it was ' shocking ' that people from private schools had such a grip on top jobs singling out the @entity31 and the judiciary for special criticism , the prime minister called for senior figures in those professions to actively ‘ find ’ poor but talented students and ‘ get them to raise aspirations ’ , rather than sitting back and simply waiting for them to apply			1
‘ i do believe it ’s not good enough just to make changes and sit back , ’ he said			2
‘ you ’ve got to get out there and try and attract talented people			1
do n’t just open the door and say we are in favour of equality of opportunity – that ’s not enough			1
you ’ve got to get out there and find them , win them over , get them to raise aspirations and get them to think they can get all the way to the top			2
’ prime minister called for senior figures in those professions to actively ' find ' poor but talented students the comments , which come after mr @entity1 said many @entity3 youngsters are less qualified for the world of work than immigrants , are likely to anger some voters			1
he was educated at @entity68 and @entity69 and presides over a @entity70 packed with millionaires			0
sir @entity10 , who rose from a council estate to @entity25 , said last week that it was ‘ truly shocking ’ that people from private schools had such a grip on top jobs in politics and other professions			1
‘ in every single sphere of @entity3 influence , the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class , ’ he said			0
‘ to me , from my background , i find that truly shocking			1
’ speaking yesterday as he flew to @entity86 ahead of the @entity87 in @entity88 , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i agree with @entity10 that we need a far more socially mobile country , and that is something we need to do far more about			1
‘ he ’s raised a very important issue			0
you only have to look at the make - up of @entity96 , the judiciary , the @entity31 , the media , it ’s not as diverse , there ’s not as much social mobility as there needs to be			0
‘ i want to see a @entity3 where , no matter where you come from , what @entity104 you worship , the colour of your skin , the community you belong to , you can get to the top in television , you can get to the top in the judiciary , you can get to the top in the armed services , you can get to the top in politics			2
‘ we are making some progress in those areas , that is not fast enough , we need to go further and faster			0
so i absolutely agree with the thrust of what @entity10 said			1
’ sir @entity10 said ' the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class ' mr @entity1 defended his appointment of public schoolboys to his cabinet and private office staff but boasted that he has increased the number of ethnic minority mps in the @entity130			1
‘ i employ people on the basis of : are they the right person to do the job , and have they got the skills and talents ? i ’m obviously choosing in terms of @entity96 from the current pool of mps			2
there ’s always more that could be done			0
‘ in some areas i ’ve had some success			0
there were no mps on my side of @entity149 or @entity3 @entity148 backgrounds , now there are			0
we ’re making some progress			0
is it fast enough ? no. ’ the prime minister also pointed out that he appointed @entity153 as @entity154			0
‘ i do n’t think the last @entity156 government had a former working miner in the @entity70 , ’ he said			0
mr @entity1 insisted the government has already done much to improve social mobility , citing the pupil premium , which channels extra money to schools with poorer pupils , improved childcare			2
despite the increase in university tuition fees , ‘ the number of people going to university from deprived backgrounds is actually at record levels ’ , he said			2
but @entity156 frontbencher @entity172 said : ‘ @entity1 has shown shocking complacency towards the one million young people unemployed under him			1
‘ now he tells them that they lack aspiration			0
it is he who is locking out opportunity for the next generation and standing up only for a privileged few			2
’ former labour cabinet minister @entity182 , now a social mobility adviser to the government , said ‘ elitism is entrenched ’ in @entity3 society – but insisted sir @entity10 was wrong to blame the situation on the last @entity156 government			1
‘ deep - rooted inequality and flatlining mobility have been decades in the making , ’ he said			0
‘ some say it is an impossible task to undo them			0
i do not succumb to that pessimism			0

@entity196 said it was ' not enough ' to provide children from poor families with equality of opportunity ' as many not confident enough to seize chances
sir @entity10 , who rose from a council estate to @entity25 , says it is ' truly shocking ' that people from private schools *dominated* jobs in politics
