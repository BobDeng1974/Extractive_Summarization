@entity1 mps could have the power to veto new laws affecting @entity1 under plans to ensure ' fairness ' for everyone in the @entity7			1
@entity8 announced the idea is one of three being considered to tackle the issue of @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws			2
it follows concern that @entity17 mps could have the deciding vote on legislation which only applies south of the border			1
home rule : the proposals by @entity8 ( left ) could stop @entity23 voting on @entity1 - only issues if he is elected as a @entity26 mp			1
mr @entity23 ( right , campaigning yesterday ) will stand for a seat in may mr @entity8 today published the proposals aimed at delivering ' @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws '			2
under the most radical option , @entity1 mps would have a separate vote in which they could veto an legislation - forcing the government either to abandon the proposals or make changes to secure majority support			1
another option would mean @entity1 - only bills would go to an @entity1 - only grand committee at second reading and the remaining stages would be governed by a convention that means mps from other nations would not vote			1
a final option sets out plans that would allow only @entity1 mps to consider the amending stages of legislation that relates only to @entity1 but the final vote would be open to all mps			1
all three proposals would involve @entity54 mps where legislation also relates to @entity54			0
mr @entity8 told the @entity55 : ' this is a fundamental issue of fairness for all the people of the @entity7			0
just as the people of @entity17 will have more power over their affairs , so it follows the people of @entity1 , @entity54 and @entity63 must have the opportunity to have a bigger say over theirs			2
' @entity66 has declined to take part in cross-party discussions on constitutional reform for @entity1 once @entity17 is handed powers over tax , welfare and public spending			1
but senior @entity74 are determined to force a vote in the @entity55 on the issue early in the @entity77			0
they argue that @entity17 mps should be barred from having the final say on laws that only affect @entity1 , given @entity17 's new rights to determine its own affairs			1
and conservative right - wingers are warning @entity85 that anything less than full - scale reform will prompt a rebellion against @entity17 devolution			1
@entity66 has indicated that it will only back the weakest form of ' @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws '			2
but @entity85 is thought to be backing the idea of an @entity1 veto			0
national differences : @entity1 @entity79 could set @entity1 - only laws under plans for increased devolution following a committee stage of @entity79 , legislation could be amended by mps from the rest of the @entity7 in the @entity55			1
but @entity1 @entity79 would then get a final ' veto vote ' before a @entity104 became law			1
@entity106 surprised opponents by promising ' @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws ' in the hours after september 's @entity111 result – insisting that like @entity17 , @entity1 must now be given more power over its own affairs			1
barring @entity17 mps from voting on key affairs would permanently hobble @entity66 's powerbase at @entity26 , given the party 's reliance on the support of its 41 mps north of the border			1
at the last election , the @entity121 won 296 of 533 mps in @entity1 and would have had an overall majority of 59 in @entity1			2
the last @entity66 government passed several key pieces of legislation – including that of introducing foundation hospitals and tuition fees – thanks to the votes of @entity17 mps whose constituents were unaffected , given @entity136 's control over health and education policy			1
now a cross-party deal following @entity17 's rejection of independence will see it also take control of income tax , vat revenues and the introduction of new benefits			0
on the warpath : new @entity149 leader @entity148 visited @entity150 yesterday scottish nationalists last night signed a provocative electoral pact with the @entity153 and @entity154 that paves the way for a deal putting @entity157 in power in the event of another hung @entity161			0
@entity17 's first minister , @entity148 , on course to seize dozens of @entity66 seats at next year 's general election , came to @entity26 to forge a ' progressive ' alliance against the @entity74			0
fears are growing that the election could produce an effective dead heat between the main parties – with only a ' rainbow coalition ' of three or more parties able to govern			0
the @entity149 has indicated that in such circumstances , it would not prop up a @entity121 - led government – but could offer support to @entity66 in return for a series of concessions			0
miss @entity148 also paid a visit to @entity85 for her first meeting with @entity106 since she became first minister			0
the prime minister confirmed that youngsters aged 16 and 17 will be able to vote in the next @entity136 election			0
he said he would devolve the power to decide the franchise in time for the 2016 poll			0
a senior @entity190 source said : ' this question has now become unavoidable			0
we want a vote in the @entity77			0
the middle ground is for @entity1 @entity79 to have a veto over anything that is going through in their name , but for the rest of the @entity55 to have votes at various stages			1
' the source said the plan for an @entity1 - only committee was ' out of date ' because it had been prepared before the latest round of devolution to @entity136 had been agreed			2
it was suggested by former commons clerk sir @entity208 , and backed by @entity66			0
' @entity208 himself says that given the scale of devolution to @entity17 , his proposal will need to be revised , ' the source said			0
' it was predicated on a very different constitutional situation			0
it is important @entity1 mps genuinely get the decisive say			2
' @entity121 right - wingers have warned of a rebellion against @entity17 devolution unless there is full - scale reform on the @entity1 votes issue			1
former cabinet minister @entity224 said : ' we do n't vote on @entity17 laws and they should n't vote on @entity1 laws			2
' @entity121 mp @entity231 said : ' the @entity1 people … do n't want another layer of government ; they want a straightforward @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws			0
' a poll published today by @entity237 found that 76 per cent of over 50s in all four parts of the @entity7 backed the view that @entity54 , @entity63 and @entity17 mps should be excluded from voting in @entity26 on matters affecting @entity1 where those matters have been devolved to their respective assembles .			1

reform plans *unveiled* today to give @entity1 mps a greater say
*pledged* after @entity17 won new powers in 11th - hour bid to stop @entity7 split
they include full ban on @entity17 mps voting on @entity1 - only legislation
@entity1 @entity79 will also have new powers of veto for @entity1 - only laws
