three years since it was discovered during excavations on an ancient cemetery , a rare bronze @entity1 cockerel has been given a permanent home			1
the 2nd century figurine is believed to be one of only nine ever found in the @entity8 , and is part of a new exhibition at the @entity11 in the @entity12			1
other finds on display include a hoard of almost 1,500 roman coins , and the perfectly preserved vase it was found in			1
this bronze and enamel cockerel was found in a child 's grave in @entity12 in 2011 - and has been painstakingly restored			1
it is now on display at the @entity11 archaeologists made the discoveries three years ago while excavating a western cemetery at the former @entity28 site on @entity29 in @entity12 - or @entity30 as it was known when it was the second largest town in @entity31			1
the bronze and enamel cockerel was said to have been placed in the grave of the two - year - old @entity1 girl by her parents , and experts believe it was used to ask the @entity36 to protect her			1
they also believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave to ease their daughter 's transition into the ' next world '			2
the child was buried wearing hobnailed shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel , and the remarkable enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel			1
the cockerel is 5 - inches tall ( 12.5cm ) and the breast , wings , eyes and ‘ comb ’ are inlaid with enamel , which now appears blue and green			1
there is a separately moulded tail plate , also enamelled , with ‘ openwork ’ decoration			2
the beak is shown open , in the act of crowing			0
it is believed that the @entity1 gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with @entity65			2
experts claim it was @entity65 , a messenger to the gods , that was also responsible for conducting newly - deceased souls to the afterlife			2
statues of this god , including one in the @entity11 , commonly show a cockerel at the base			2
the association probably stems from @entity65 ’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘ announcer ’ of the new dawn			0
@entity65 was also the ‘ herdsman for the dead ’ , guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife			0
it is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of @entity65 and expresses a parent ’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world			0
' it is the most significant @entity1 cemetery investigation in the town since the early 1970s , ' said a spokesman for the town ’s @entity11			1
' the cockerel found underneath the @entity102 ’s garage site - now @entity103 - is one of only nine known cockerel figurines from the @entity1 world , and is the only example with its tail intact			2
' displayed with the cockerel are an exceptional example of a @entity1 flagon and a selection of jewellery which include beads and bracelets found in a richly furnished child ’s grave			1
' these are high status objects , which give a fascinating insight into the people of @entity30			0
@entity121 , chief executive of @entity122 added : ' the cockerel is the most spectacular find from more than 60 @entity1 burials excavated at this site			0
' it was excavated from the grave of young child and was placed close to its head			2
interestingly a very similar item was found in @entity133 in @entity134 and it looks like they both could have come from the same workshop based in @entity31			0
' the @entity138 , also on display at the museum , contain 1,437 silver and copper - alloy 3rd century roman coins			1
' the hoard is the museum ’s first @entity145 and comes from a fascinating period of political upheaval across the @entity8 , ' continued the museum 's spokesman			1
' it was a time of rapid succession of rulers and usurpers			0
the coins themselves tell this story			0
' depictions and inscriptions represent 12 emperors from just a 16 year period			0
' the child was buried wearing hobnailed shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel and the remarkable enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel			1
the cockerel is 5 - inches tall ( 12.5cm ) and the breast , wings , eyes and ‘ comb ’ are inlaid with enamel , which now appears blue and green			1
there is a separately moulded tail plate , also enamelled , with ‘ openwork ’ decoration			0
the beak is shown open , in the act of crowing			0
the bronze and enamel cockerel ( pictured ) was said to have been placed in the grave of the two - year - old @entity1 girl by her parents , and experts believe it was used to ask the @entity36 to protect her			1
they also believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave to ease their daughter 's transition into the ' next world ' archaeologists made the discoveries three years ago while excavating a western cemetery at the former @entity28 site on @entity29 in @entity12			1
the finds are now on display at the @entity11 ( pictured ) in the town the @entity138 , a selection of which is also on display at the museum ( pictured ) , contains 1,437 silver and copper - alloy 3rd century roman coins			1
the perfectly preserved vase the hoard was found in is also on display it is believed that the @entity1 gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with @entity65			1
experts claim it was @entity65 , a messenger to the gods , that was also responsible for conducting newly - deceased souls to the afterlife			2
the cockerel ( pictured ) is 5 - inches tall ( 12.5cm ) and the breast , wings , and eyes are inlaid with enamel the conservation work took four months to be painstakingly carried out by experts			1
archaeologist @entity121 , from @entity226 , said the work had ' exceeded expectations ' , particularly for highlighting its fine enamel detail			0
' it reinforces what a fantastic article this is and how highly prized and expensive it must have been , ' he said			0
' this must have cost , in current money , thousands of pounds to buy and countless hours to make , and so to actually put this into the grave of a two or three - year - old child is not something that you would do lightly			1
' it really shows that this was a very wealthy , important family , and signifies the love that the parents had for the dead child			0
' a burial site was unearthed at the site including more than 40 burials and four cremations ; something experts said was the largest archaeological find in the town since the 1970s			0
this particular figurine is one of only four ever found in @entity31 , with a total of eight known from the whole of the @entity8			1
mr @entity121 added : ' without a doubt this is the best @entity1 cockerel ever found in @entity31			0
' this is the best find that i have seen come out of @entity12 in 30 to 40 years and is of national significance			2
' the object is believed to have been made in northern @entity31 , with evidence pointing to a workshop in @entity267 , @entity268 , which made enamel artefacts			0
talks are under way to find a permanent display site for the cockerel , possibly at the @entity11 in @entity12			1
only nine similar cockerel figurines are known from the @entity1 world , including four from @entity31			0
the similarities in construction and decoration suggest that they were made at roughly the same time and could have come from the same workshop			0
our example is the only one from @entity31 to have come from a grave and the only one from any location to have survived with a tail			0
the two which are closest in form are from @entity133 in @entity134 and @entity289 in the @entity290			0
in these examples the enamelling survives in the original colours of yellow , blue and red and it is probable that the @entity12 example was originally just as brightly coloured			2
@entity31 produced some of the finest enamelled objects in the @entity8 and these were traded as far afield as @entity134 , @entity300 , @entity301 and @entity302			2
the four enamelled cockerels from the continent all come from @entity134 and the @entity305 .			0

it is believed to be one of only nine known in the @entity8
