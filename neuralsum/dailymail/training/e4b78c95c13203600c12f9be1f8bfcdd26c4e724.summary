the heads of the unnerving figures , dressed in hooded tops and trousers , were created out of stuffed animals			1
instead of a face on each model there is a bundle of taxidermic ducklings , raccoons , skunks and squirrels			1
the heads of the unnerving figures , dressed in hooded tops and trousers , were created out of stuffed animals the statues are works of art by the sculptor @entity22 , a professor of visual arts at @entity24 , in @entity25			1
most of the stuffed animals were bought from a taxidermist in @entity25 but the ducklings had to be imported from @entity29			1
he placed the two sculptures - called @entity31 - in busy areas in @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 , @entity36 to observe the reactions of the public the idea was that passers - by might not notice the difference between the sculptures and real people			2
the statues are by the sculptor @entity22 , a professor of visual arts at @entity24 , in @entity25 instead of a face on each model there is a bundle of taxidermied ducklings , raccons , skunks and squirrels the two sculptures were placed in busy areas in @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 , @entity36 mr @entity22 said he liked to leave the sculptures in public places without revealing them as pieces of art immediately			1
he said : ' people responded with surprise , then laughter or anger , or where generally creeped out - but at least half took a picture of the sculpture , or of themselves standing beside it			0
' oddly enough children often noticed the sculptures before adults and would get really excited - laughing and hugging them			0
' instead , he added that he aims ‘ to insert an anomaly into the viewer ’s experience of the everyday ’			0
he said : ‘ these works make reference to comical cartoon clichés , and contrasts our conceptual understanding of nature with the reality of animals inhabiting our proximity			0
' a spokesman for the artist added : ' [ the sculptures are ] playful reflections on the relationship between humans and animals in the urban environment			2
' the sculptures will appear to be just another commuter in transit			0
however , once the viewer gets close enough to glance into the hooded parka they will discover that it is not a person but a series of animals standing on each others ’ backs , bundled up in clothing and working together to mimic a human			0
