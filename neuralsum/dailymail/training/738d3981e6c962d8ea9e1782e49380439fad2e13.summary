raising awareness : @entity1 , pictured with his wife @entity2 , suffered ' sparkles ' in his vision which turned out to be cancer the look was more rock star than former chairman of @entity9			1
so when @entity1 was spotted last month on the far - from - sunny terraces at @entity9 sporting the kind of sunglasses of which @entity15 frontman @entity14 would be proud , fans were understandably curious			1
in fact , his eyewear was not a fashion statement			0
during the summer , the 56 - year - old entrepreneur was diagnosed with a rare and deadly form of cancer in his right eyeball			1
within ten days he was undergoing surgery to have the eye removed			1
‘ it has been a body blow , ’ admits @entity1 , who lives in @entity25 with wife @entity2 and the youngest three of their five children			2
the first sign that something was n’t right came at @entity31 , when he began to notice ‘ sparkles ’ in his vision			2
the flashes of light occurred most often when he stood up or moved suddenly			0
‘ my gp said he thought it was probably due to a problem with my sinuses and prescribed me antibiotics and steroids , ’ @entity1 recalls			1
but the episodes persisted , and by august the problem became hard to ignore			2
working at his desk one day , @entity1 noticed a flash so bright that he turned his head , mistakenly thinking somebody had taken a photograph			1
he booked an appointment with an optometrist for the following morning – and the examination revealed a tumour growing on the retina			1
there are about 600 cases of uveal melanoma diagnosed in the @entity57 each year			2
a body scan showed that the cancer had n’t spread , but @entity1 will need regular check - ups as in half of cases tumours return in other parts of the body , particularly the liver			1
ten days later @entity1 saw consultant surgeon @entity67 , director of the @entity69 service			1
@entity71 - beam therapy – a precise form of radiotherapy – was considered but discounted by @entity1 because it would have resulted in blindness in any case			1
he elected to have his eye removed instead			0
@entity1 had little time to analyse his feelings about losing an eye before the surgery was carried out			2
‘ yes , losing an eye was tough but i did n’t spend much time worrying about it , ’ he says			0
‘ it was a logical decision			0
’ the operation to remove the eyeball was carried out in september			0
at the same time , a temporary prosthetic ball , made from coral because of its similarity to human tissue , was implanted and attached to the remaining muscles , which means it can move in the same way as a real one			0
@entity9 fans were curious when they spotted @entity1 wearing glasses more akin to @entity14 from @entity15 former @entity9 chairman @entity1 , left , pictured in 2009 with former @entity9 manager @entity103 a permanent prosthetic ball will be fitted once the post-surgery swelling subsides			1
@entity1 tends to wear sunglasses while out to disguise his missing eye until the permanent prosthetic is fitted			2
he is able to drive again and is back at work – he is president of an international publishing firm and sits on the board of several other companies , as well as running a football consultancy			0
‘ i find commuting a challenge – particularly the concourse at @entity117 ’s @entity116 , where people are rushing at you from different directions , ’ he says			0
@entity1 is now evangelical about raising awareness of eye health and is campaigning with the @entity123 to emphasise the importance of regular examinations			1
‘ i ’ve been lucky to have perfect vision all my life and have never been very aware of eye health as a result			0
' i really want to encourage people to go for an eye examination once every two years			0
an eye exam can pick up early warning signs for cancer , blood pressure and diabetes			0
' if i ’d known how important they were , there ’s every chance i ’d still have both my eyes			0
