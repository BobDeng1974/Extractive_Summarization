@entity0 may have been last friday but @entity1 could be in for another fright night when they take on @entity3 in the @entity4			1
the stuttering @entity5 , who have not looked themselves in either the @entity7 or the @entity8 this season , will come up against @entity11 's most feared and in - form forward line in the @entity13 capital			1
@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 - facing @entity3 is like opening the @entity20 at the moment and all those torments are expected to feature on tuesday night			1
@entity23 faces another difficult evening as @entity1 take on @entity3 in the @entity4 on tuesday @entity3 's @entity14 has scored more goals than the entire @entity1 team so far this season @entity16 celebrates scoring in @entity3 's 4 - 0 win at @entity27 on saturday , their 11th win in succession while @entity1 have won just six matches this season , @entity3 have won their last 11 matches across all competitions , scoring a staggering 46 goals in the process			1
@entity1 have scored 13 in the same period			2
any illusions @entity23 had about facing the might of the defending @entity39 champions were blown away at @entity40 a fortnight ago when rampant @entity3 won 3 - 0			1
three first - half goals - one from @entity14 and two from @entity17 - exposed the massive gulf in quality between the two sides and that is likely to be repeated in the cauldron of the @entity4			1
the fact @entity23 is prepared to rest captain @entity49 , who has made 127 @entity39 appearances in his career , and make other team changes with one eye on saturday 's visit of @entity55 suggests this is already a damage limitation exercise			2
@entity23 , who is coming under heavy criticism for not adequately replacing @entity58 over the summer , could also field the likes of @entity60 and @entity61 to see if they can handle the big @entity39 nights			0
chances are they - and mis - firing forward @entity65 - will see very little of the ball			0
this will be a back - to - the - wall mission as @entity3 come at them with all guns blazing			0
with @entity76 also expected to be rested , 33 - year - old @entity71 , who has started only @entity73 games this season , and @entity75 will attempt to stem the tide			0
@entity14 alone will keep them both occupied			0
even by his stratospheric standards , the @entity80 star is having an exceptional season			0
he has scored 22 goals in all competitions for @entity3 this season			1
to put that stat into context , the entire @entity1 team has scored just 19			0
@entity89 has @entity15 to call upon once again following his return from injury @entity17 heads home @entity3 's second goal in their 3 - 0 win at @entity40 a fortnight ago the @entity96 forward scored two goals in the one - sided win at @entity40 as @entity1 were overpowered @entity14 has scored 22 goals in all competitions this season ; three more than @entity1 have managed in total			1
indeed , @entity14 has netted in each of his last 12 games for @entity3 , scoring 20 in the process ( 1.7 per game )			1
@entity14 ( 70 ) needs one more goal to equal @entity108 ’s all - time goalscoring record in the @entity8 ( 71 goals )			1
@entity17 has scored in three successive cl appearances ( four goals ) – he has n’t scored in four successive cl apps since march 2011			0
@entity17 ( 7 ) has provided more assists than any other @entity3 player this season ( all comps )			0
@entity16 has created 38 goalscoring chances in all competitions for @entity3 this term , more than any other player			0
@entity16 and @entity14 celebrate the @entity80 player 's goal in the @entity122 with @entity123 @entity3 have scored 37 league goals so far in 2014/15 ; 10 more than any other side competing in the top five @entity39 leagues			1
@entity3 have fired in 84 shots on target in league competition this term , the most of any team in the top five @entity39 leagues			2
@entity18 has made 704 successful passes this season ( league only ) , 117 more than any @entity1 player			0
in the @entity8 this season , @entity3 have posted a shot conversion rate of 22.7 per cent ( 4th best ) ; @entity1 have converted just 6.7 per cent of their shots			2
courtesy of @entity140 @entity14 has also scored in his last 12 matches , making him the most in - form striker in world football and surely a shoo - in for the @entity144 in the @entity145			1
he is never more motivated than when there is a record to break and history could be made on tuesday night if he scores the two goals required to overtake @entity108 as the @entity8 's all - time top scorer			1
the former @entity3 striker has 71 , with @entity14 just one behind			2
his great rival - @entity123 's @entity154 - is a further goal back on 69			0
although @entity14 is undoubtedly the scariest , he is merely the first of the demons @entity1 will have to slay in order to emerge with respectibility from this match			2
@entity13 newspaper @entity161 believe @entity14 will surpass @entity108 's @entity8 scoring record @entity1 's @entity49 , @entity75 and @entity65 at the final whistle following their 1 - 0 loss at @entity165 in the @entity7 on saturday @entity1 train at the @entity167 on the eve of the @entity8 showdown 1			1
@entity108 ( @entity3 , @entity170 ) 71 goals 2			2
@entity14 ( @entity172 , @entity3 ) 70 3			2
@entity154 ( @entity123 ) 69 4			0
@entity174 ( @entity173 , @entity172 , @entity3 ) 56 5			0
@entity175 ( @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity123 ) 50 ( excluding qualifying rounds ) @entity15 is at @entity89 's disposal once again after a gluteus injury but there are suggestions even the world 's most expensive player will struggle to get back into the side , such is @entity3 's brilliant recent form			2
in his absence they played @entity1 off the park at @entity40 , won the first @entity122 of the season 3 - 1 against @entity123 and then thrashed @entity27 4 - 0 on saturday			1
@entity15 was instrumental in @entity3 's @entity189 last season but now he 's just a nice dilemma for @entity89 to have with @entity192 also performing very well			0
@entity16 , meanwhile , has looked better and better with every appearance in the famous white strip and scored a glorious left - foot volley at the weekend , his sixth of the season , that was every bit as good as the one for @entity200 against @entity201 at the @entity202 that encouraged real to buy him			2
@entity16 has also contributed seven assists so far this season , more than anyone else in the @entity3 team			0
@entity18 has already established himself as the heartbeat in the @entity3 midfield @entity211 heads home @entity1 's winner on their last visit to the @entity4 in 2009 @entity1 's slender away win in the last 16 tie was followed by a 4 - 0 rout of the @entity13 side at @entity40 @entity17 , meanwhile , ca n't really fail to benefit from such silver service and has nine goals to his credit already this season , while @entity18 looks as though he has been running the @entity3 midfield for a decade			1
the @entity224 has played 704 successful passes this season and his passing accuracy is up at 93 per cent , making his £ 20m transfer fee look like a bargain			0
as if all this was n't ominous enough , it is 940 days since @entity3 last failed to score in a home match and it is over three - and - a - half years since they last lost a @entity8 game at the @entity4			1
it really is difficult to find convincing reasons to suggest @entity1 can get something here but they did triumph on their last visit - 1 - 0 back in 2009 , with @entity211 on target			1
perhaps @entity23 can hold on to that as he prepares his team for what could well be a nightmarish evening			0
video real guard against complacency as @entity15 returns			0

@entity1 take on @entity3 in the @entity4 on tuesday night
the defending @entity39 champions are in *sensational* form
@entity3 have won their last 11 matches , scoring 46 goals in the process
@entity14 has scored 22 goals - three more than @entity1
the @entity80 needs just one more to equal @entity108 's @entity39 record
real beat @entity1 3 - 0 at @entity40 a fortnight ago
the @entity5 are in poor form and lost to @entity165 at the weekend
