the ceo of @entity1 has finally responded to @entity3 's refusal to post any of her albums on the streaming service , revealing he is ' really frustrated ' with the singer			1
@entity7 said in an open letter that while he agrees with @entity3 's belief that music is art and has real value , he was upset with how her comments made it seem as if his service does not compensate artists			1
he then stated that @entity1 has ' paid more than $ 2billion to labels , publishers and collecting societies for distribution to songwriters and recording artists			2
' we started @entity1 because we love music and piracy was killing it			2
' @entity7 then points out that it is piracy that is ruining music and hurting musicians , and that no one has made any money at all from piracy , while @entity1 has paid out the aforementioned $ 2billion to members of the music industry			1
he then goes into his problem with the artists who complain about his service			0
' when i hear stories about artists and songwriters who say they ’ve seen little or no money from streaming and are naturally angry and frustrated , i ’m really frustrated too , ' he says			0
' as i said , we ’ve already paid more than $ 2 billion in royalties to the music industry and if that money is not flowing to the creative community in a timely and transparent way , that ’s a big problem			2
' he then breaks down some of the myths people believe to be true , like the fact that artists do n't really get paid by services like @entity1			2
' unlike other free music options – from piracy to @entity72 to @entity73 – we pay artists and rights holders every time a song is played on our free service , ' he explains			0
record numbers : @entity7 ( left ) says his service has paid $ 2billion to the music industry since its start , and that the real enemy to musicians like @entity3 ( right ) is piracy he then takes on the claim that no artist could ever earn a living from their music playing on @entity1 because they pay so little per play , comparing his service to radio			1
' if a song has been listened to 500 thousand times on @entity1 , that ’s the same as it having been played once on a @entity95 radio station with a moderate sized audience of 500 thousand people			0
which would pay the recording artist precisely … nothing at all			0
but the equivalent of that one play and it ’s 500 thousand listens on @entity1 would pay out between three and four thousand dollars			0
' @entity7 then shades @entity3 a bit by listing the artists who have successfully promoted their albums on @entity1 before their release , including her pal @entity108 and diva pop star @entity110 , and pointing out that the most pirated album in the world last week was @entity3 's newest release , 1989			1
despite those piracy numbers , @entity3 did still manage to shatter single week sales records when she moved 1.3 million copies of the album in its debut week , the most since 2002			1
wait a minute : major artists like @entity119 ( left ) and @entity120 ( right ) have withheld new music from the streaming service for months after its release @entity7 closes his letter by saying of @entity1 , ' we ’re not just streaming , we ’re mainstreaming now , and that ’s good for music makers and music lovers around the world			1
' @entity3 is not the first artist to withhold music from @entity1 , with big name artists including @entity119 and @entity120 waiting months to release their albums in full to the service			1
other artists have been more vocal about their dislike for the way the site operates , including @entity140 frontman @entity139 who took @entity1 to task over their business model			1
@entity139 wrote on @entity146 , ' make no mistake , new artists you discover on @entity1 will not get paid			2
meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it			0
@entity150 ' he then added in another tweet , ' new artists get paid fu * k all with this model			0
' angry bird : @entity140 frontman @entity139 ( left ) has expressed his disdain for the service and how it does not help new artists , while investor @entity159 ( right ) was called an ' a * * hole " and a ' thief ' by @entity164 singer @entity163 @entity164 frontman @entity163 also voiced his disdain for the service , and one of its original investors , infamous tech entrepreneur and @entity171 founder @entity159 , who he labeled an ' a * * hole			1
