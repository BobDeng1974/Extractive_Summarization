@entity0 should stay at @entity1 and forget about returning to the @entity2 says his international manager @entity3			1
@entity0 's future has been the subject of much debate since @entity1 fans began booing the world 's most expensive player at the @entity10 , while the @entity1 media have accused him of being ' lazy ' and a ' ball hog ' in trying to shoot for goal rather than pass to colleagues			1
team - mate @entity15 has also shown his displeasure over the @entity18 's supposed selfishness and the @entity20 forward reacted petulantly when @entity0 scored last weekend - his double in a 2 - 0 win over @entity23 as he netted his first goals in 10 games			1
@entity0 covers his ears as he celebrates his goal for @entity1 against @entity23 on sunday @entity0 charges forward with the ball past @entity23 's @entity29 during sunday 's @entity31 clash @entity0 responded to his first goal by covering his ears with his hands - seen as a sign that he was not listening to the criticism - and kicking the corner flag , and it has led to fevered speculation that he could return home to the @entity2 this summer			1
@entity41 's @entity40 have been linked with bringing the former @entity43 player back to @entity44 and it has been suggested that @entity45 could swap him for their @entity1 - born goalkeeper @entity46			1
but @entity47 manager @entity3 said : ' he should stay where he is			2
' @entity40 are a huge club and have been successful as are @entity45 - but @entity1 is @entity1			1
' @entity0 's good enough to win the big trophies , play on the big stage and play with the biggest club			0
@entity0 kicks the corner flag as he celebrates his goal at the @entity54 ' it is different from @entity45 or @entity40 because while there is pressure on them to perform in every game , at @entity1 it is almost like a show and there has to be entertainment			1
' you have to be one of the best to play for them and , in my opinion , @entity0 is good enough to win trophies and entertain at @entity1 at the highest level			2
' despite @entity0 's difficult start to 2015 , @entity3 insists his talismanic forward is in good spirits ahead of @entity47 ' table - topping @entity73 qualifier in @entity74 on saturday week			1
surprise front - runners @entity74 have won their opening three matches but @entity47 are unbeaten after four games and have taken points off the top two seeds , @entity81 and @entity82			2
' i spoke to his agent three days ago , he is absolutely fine and there are no problems , ' @entity3 said			0
@entity47 manager @entity3 has urged @entity0 to stay at @entity1 and forget a @entity2 return ' @entity89 is the most expensive player in the world and there is politics to all this			1
' he 's been caught up in a bit of a storm but , knowing @entity96 as i do , i 'd be really surprised if he said , ' i 've had enough , i 'm not accepting that and i 'm coming home '			0
' everyone has good and bad periods and you just have to get through it and , saying that , he scored a couple of goals at the weekend			0
' but @entity3 admits that he has been taken aback by nature of the criticism aimed at the 25 - year - old from @entity108 ' it 's just not people venting their anger			2
some of the attacks have been quite personal , ' @entity3 said			0
' you ca n't say @entity1 have lost two or three games because of @entity0			2
@entity115 double silences critics @entity0 falls down during the match between @entity1 and @entity23 in the @entity119 capital on sunday ' that 's not the truth , but he has been personally attacked			1
' i do n't know what the future will be for him , but all i can say is when he comes with us then it 's not a problem			0
' he works hard for us and fits into the system whether we play him down the middle or wide , as a nine or a 10			0
' we may go to @entity130 next week and he has a bad game , but he can still score us a goal that will win us the game out of nothing			0
' the pressure is on but he has shown he can handle that in big games			0
' he likes being in that environment where there is everything on it and he deserves to play in a major tournament			0
