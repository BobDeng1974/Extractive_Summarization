by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 18 october 2012 devastated : @entity1 and @entity2 have been ordered to rip down the £ 10,000 panels from the £ 750,000 grade ii - listed property - despite insisting that they are only visible from the bottom of one neighbour 's garden installing 18 solar panels on the back of the roof seemed the best way to go green while preserving the character of their listed home			1
but out of sight is not out of mind as far as @entity1 and @entity2 ’s local council is concerned			1
the couple have been ordered to rip down the £ 10,000 panels from the £ 750,000 grade ii - listed property – despite insisting that they are only visible from the bottom of one neighbour ’s garden			1
the panels will have ‘ a significant visual impact which will diminish the special interest of the building , including its character and setting ’ , the council said in a report			1
‘ the energy - saving benefits that may be derived are not considered to outweigh the harm that would be caused			1
’ in addition , allowing them to remain would set a precedent which ‘ could have far - reaching consequences for @entity36 ’s historic environment ’			2
last night , mr @entity37 , 47 , a company director , said : ‘ our electricity bill has halved already – and the government is encouraging people to do what we have done			0
if we have to pull them down we ’ll be devastated			0
’ mrs @entity2 , 39 , added : ‘ a house on the other side of the village green where the building is not listed has solar panels on its roof and they are completely visible from the front			1
it does n’t make sense			0
’ the couple live in a late 18th - century home in @entity54 , @entity36 , with their children @entity57 , eight , and @entity58 , 11			0
the panels were installed in february but the couple applied for planning permission retrospectively			0
permission to keep all 18 was refused by @entity36 council , as was a revised application to retain 15			0
out of sight ? : this picture shows the solar panels on the rear roof of the @entity69 home @entity70 and @entity71 objected in a letter to the council			2
but yesterday councillor @entity74 said : ‘ i think the committee was splitting hairs			0
’ however , @entity77 , chairman of @entity79 ’s planning committee , said : ‘ they are on a listed building			1
they are highly visible from a neighbouring property and would be setting a precedent			0
’ mr and mrs @entity2 are now considering whether to appeal .			2

@entity1 and @entity2 have been ordered to rip down the £ 10,000 panels from the @entity88 - listed property
the panels will have ‘ a significant visual impact which will diminish the special interest of the building ' , said the local council
