by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:09 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 5 july 2013 @entity2 today claimed @entity3 had moved ' one step closer ' to having a say on the @entity6 as the @entity7 backed an in - out referendum			1
in a landmark parliamentary 304 mps voted in favour of a referendum , with none voting against as almost all @entity15 and @entity14 boycotted @entity16			1
there was loud cheering on the @entity7 ' green benches as a backbench @entity20 , spearheaded by @entity22 mp @entity21 , cleared the first hurdle in its difficult battle to become law			0
deal : @entity2 backed the referendum @entity20 championed by @entity22 mp @entity21 ( right ) choice : the prime minister , who earlier met patients @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) and his mother @entity33 during a visit to the @entity35 , ridiculed @entity15 and @entity37 opposition to a referendum the @entity29 has ordered all @entity22 mps to back legislation paving the way for a referendum on @entity6 membership by the end of 2017			1
last night he hosted a barbecue in the @entity47 gardens to persuade mps to stay in @entity49 today – rather than go to constituencies – for the landmark commons vote @entity53 and @entity54 have dismissed the @entity55 as a stunt designed to shore up the prime minister 's position with his rank and file - pointing out that it has virtually no chance of becoming law			1
but after the result was announced , mr @entity2 wrote on @entity64 : ' @entity55 passes first commons stage , bringing us one step closer to giving the @entity3 people a say on @entity70			1
' as the @entity7 debate on legislating for a referendum by 2017 got under , foreign secretary @entity71 told @entity48 the @entity6 now lacks democratic legitimacy and must be reformed			1
foreign secretary @entity71 told the @entity7 that the @entity6 now lacks democratic legitimacy mr @entity71 said : ' the efforts of those who want to build @entity70 integration without bringing the people with them have been utterly self - defeating			1
' the @entity6 now lacks democratic legitimacy because so many of those most enthusiastic about ever - closer union have been afraid of asking what people might think of it			2
he added : ' no institution can survive without the people 's support and the @entity6 that will emerge from the eurozone crisis may look very different from the @entity6 before the crisis			2
' earlier mr @entity21 told the @entity91 that @entity15 and the @entity37 are ‘ running scared ’ of confronting the issue			2
he said the legislation would mean future governments must change the law if they want to reverse the plan – which he said is ‘ politically virtually impossible ’			0
prime steak ? mr @entity2 flips burgers at the 10 @entity101 bbq for conservative mps cheers : @entity22 mp @entity104 tweeted this photo ( left ) of a pint of @entity107 in the @entity101 garden while mp @entity109 posed with the pm for a pint mr @entity21 said the @entity55 would mean a ‘ legal deadline ’ for a referendum to happen before the end of 2017			1
‘ it has been nearly 40 years since the @entity3 people last had their say on @entity70 - and most of us have never had a say on @entity70 at all			0
i was n’t even born at the last referendum , ’ he added			0
‘ in that time , so much has changed - the countries involved and the powers the @entity6 has , as well as the benefits and costs of membership			2
people feel that the @entity6 has been heading in a direction they never signed up to			0
this question about our membership is already there and ignoring it will not make it go away			0
these concerns deserve to be heard and acted upon			0
’ dismissing the idea that the legislation is worthless , since it could simply be ignored by an incoming @entity15 government , the mp insisted : ‘ if my @entity55 is passed it would be legally impossible for a future government to ignore it and , when you think about it , politically virtually impossible to reverse it too			0
' tongs : @entity2 is hosting a barbecue for @entity48 tonight , in scenes reminiscent of when he grilled meat with @entity144 president @entity143 in the @entity101 gardens the prime minister adopted some hot dog diplomacy last night to persuade his mps to stay for the @entity7 debate			1
aide @entity150 tweeted a picture of the prime minister ‘ breaking a sweat as he flips burgers at @entity155 ’ last night			1
mr @entity2 hunches over a grill , tongue between his teeth , as he chats to @entity159 and @entity161 mp @entity160			1
the eurosceptic wing of his party has been a thorn in mr @entity2 ’s side , but he is now courting support for the @entity55 , as well as committing to a referendum if he wins the next election			1
it has triggered a @entity171 row , with the prime minister saying @entity54 ’s @entity14 ‘ have to get off the fence ’			1
mr @entity2 is an old hand at the barbecue , having had a cook - out with @entity144 president @entity143			1
but his attempt to woo his mps has not won everyone over			0
one said : ‘ in 2011 i was threatened with death for voting for an @entity6 referendum , now i ’m whipped and invited to a * * * * ing bbq			1
’ cuisine : the prime minister will be able to call on the services of the custom designed ith a @entity186 given to him by @entity143 last year the change of heart means that @entity3 may be given their first say on @entity70 in nearly 40 years			1
the @entity20 ’s sponsor says @entity15 and @entity14 are ‘ running scared ’ of the issue as @entity22 prepare to back an in / out vote today			1
in a sign of crumbling @entity15 discipline , shadow minister @entity192 broke ranks to insist : ‘ the truth is the @entity3 needs to decide and i would prefer it to do so more quickly			2
i know this is n’t @entity15 policy , but my view is we should have a referendum next year			2
’ @entity14 have refused to accept a coalition government @entity20 , but the prime minister has imposed a three - line whip – the strongest possible instruction – for the vote today , a highly unusual move for backbench legislation			1
that means members of the government who might vote against must resign			0
the legislation requires a national referendum by the end of 2017 on the question : ‘ do you think the @entity3 should remain a member of the @entity6 ? ’ mr @entity21 added : ' the @entity20 says that the government - any future government - must by the end of 2016 have set a date for a referendum by the end of 2017			1
so any government that dared to try to ignore this law and deny the people a vote could be taken to court by anyone			0
‘ of course , if after the next election there ’s a majority in @entity232 against a referendum - and what a tragedy that would be - a different government could try to pass a new law to scrap the referendum , but that is a fundamental rule of our ancient constitution			0
‘ so , of course , if you want to be sure of having your say on @entity3 ’s place in @entity70 , then vote @entity244 at the next election			2
but even so it would take a prime minister and a government of astonishing arrogance to vote down a referendum that was already the law of the land			1
’ cross-party : @entity22 mp @entity21 ( left ) is pushing the referendum @entity55 to a vote in the @entity7 , but @entity15 mp @entity192 today said he thought his party should also back an in - out vote mr @entity21 said that since the @entity244 do not have a @entity7 majority , on the face of it today ’s legislation would struggle to pass			1
‘ but the soundings i have taken suggest we could be on course to clear the first hurdle towards putting the referendum on the statute books			0
we have the backing of the @entity267 , ’ he said			0
‘ we just need a few @entity15 or @entity37 mps to support the @entity55			0
this is n’t about playing politics - it ’s about letting the @entity3 people have their say on one of the most important issues of today			0
i would encourage them all to ignore the dictat of their leaderships , listen to their constituents and vote for the @entity55			0
' i know there are mps in other parties who want to			0
they need not fear their leaderships			0
@entity53 and @entity37 high command are running scared - why else would they have told their mps to stay away from @entity232 today ? ‘ today marks the beginning of our attempt to make @entity3 ’s first referendum on @entity70 for 38 years happen			0
with a bit of help from mps from all parties , my @entity55 could write an in - out referendum into law by the end of 2017 , the chance to finally let the @entity3 people have their say and decide our future , ’ he added			2
the @entity20 cleared the @entity7 tonight , but @entity15 believes it will not succeed in reaching the statute book by the cut - off date of may 2014 , when the parliamentary session comes to an end			2
the @entity55 is likely to run into trouble in the @entity303 , where @entity244 are not the largest party			0
a @entity15 source said : ‘ it is our view that it is quite wrong to legislate for an in / out referendum in 2017 which would create four years of uncertainty , putting at risk the national interest and damaging @entity3 jobs and the economy			2
’ labour leader @entity53 urged mps to dodge the @entity7 vote , calling it ‘ a @entity22 gimmick ’ .			0

prime minister hosts @entity244 get together to *soothe* *relations*
@entity15 and @entity14 boycotting *tomorrow* 's commons vote on @entity6
mr @entity2 has promised an in - out referendum by 2017
@entity22 *punished* as ' *rebels* ' for backing referendum now invited for bash
