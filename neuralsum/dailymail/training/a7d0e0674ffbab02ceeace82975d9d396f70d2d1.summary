by @entity0 a legend has grown up over the years that @entity2 is a fair - weather golfer			1
a legend , it has to be said , that @entity2 has contributed handsomely towards both in word and hapless deed when the elements have turned unkind			1
so to @entity8 on friday , where the forecast @entity2 had seen first thing predicting a pleasant 19 degrees turned out to be way wide of the mark , with the reality being a cold , wet and thoroughly miserable day			1
thirty minutes after the end of his second round , he still had no feeling in the little finger on his left hand and the thumb on his right			0
at the par - four seventh hole , he had thinned a greenside bunker shot so badly he ended up with a double - bogey six			2
bad start : @entity2 began his round with back - to - back bogeys at @entity8 on friday cheer up , @entity2 : the @entity27 made three birdies in the last four holes to end on one - under par in short , and given all the other distractions going on in his life , if ever there was a back nine to stop drying the clubs with his towel and chuck it in instead , this was it			1
happily , and to the delight of the thousands who trudged through the mud to watch him , that was precisely what did not happen at the @entity45			0
on a course where he has no track record , the 25 - year - old from @entity50 summoned up commendable resolve to play the final seven holes in four under par. to put that sequence into perspective , @entity54 , the man who redesigned this @entity56 course in 2010 and playing alongside him , completed them in three over			2
it all added up to a gutsy 71 for @entity2 and a heartening two - round total of 139 blows			1
far from a weekend off , which has been his lot here for the past two years , he has actually moved into the thick of contention on five under par. moving on : @entity2 split from @entity68 earlier this week with the pair due to get married lining it up : @entity2 is five shots behind leaders @entity72 and @entity74 after starting the week with one dramatic statement , announcing he had split from fiancee @entity68 , he has put himself into position to make another			1
there ’s never a dull moment with the @entity27 , is there ? how characteristic of his rollercoaster life that he should follow up his holed wedge shot for an eagle two at the seventh on thursday with a holy hash of a bunker shot for a score no fewer than four shots worse on friday			1
at least he was consistent on the other hole where he claimed an eagle on day one , the par - five 12th			2
this time he followed that up with a seven - iron to 12 feet and rolled in the putt for a matching three			0
@entity2 bogeyed the 13th but birdied three of the last four holes to lie joint fifth on a leaderboard where the @entity96 has been joined by @entity97 @entity74			1
@entity72 had a rough start but his play matched the weather as he improved the longer the day went on			0
he finished with a 72 to stand on 10 under , while @entity74 birdied both of the last two holes to follow up his impressive opening 64 with a 70			0
on the move : @entity2 has moved into contention for the @entity8 title with an impressive back nine the only player to beat @entity2 in his half of the draw was @entity111 @entity110 , who is on six under after a second - round 73			1
the one player to match him was feisty @entity114 @entity113 , who showed his taste for the big time with his runner - up finish in the masters last month			2
‘ i really want to make @entity122 ’s @entity121 team , ’ he said , and he ’s showing it			0
an exciting weekend is in prospect , with @entity124 going for his third win in four years while the 18th green on sunday could see the crowning of a new world no 1 once more			0
@entity129 shot 71 to stand on five under and he is nicely placed to limit @entity131 ’s time at the top to one week and emulate the achievement of @entity124 himself , who went to world no 1 by defeating @entity136 to win this title in 2011			0
@entity124 showed his liking for these acres once more with a fine round of 67 , featuring an amazing run of five threes in a row from the eighth , representing three birdies , one eagle and a par. he is six under			0
perched on the periphery are the @entity150 triumvirate of @entity151 and @entity136 on two under , with @entity152 a further shot adrift .			0

@entity2 is five - under par heading into the weekend at @entity8
the @entity27 *recovered* from a poor start to his second round
he made three birdies in the last four holes to finish with a score of 71
@entity2 split from @entity68 earlier this week
