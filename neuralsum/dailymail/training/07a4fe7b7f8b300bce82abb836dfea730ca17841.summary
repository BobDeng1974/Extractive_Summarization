by @entity0 a @entity2 sufferer has ‘ cured ’ her symptoms by dancing to @entity5 's ‘ @entity4 ’			1
@entity6 has suffered from the disease for eight years but has only recently found she can walk and talk normally while listening to certain types of music			1
the 73 - year - old from @entity11 - on - @entity12 , @entity13 , has always loved dancing - but thought she 'd never be able to hit the dance floor again when she was diagnosed with @entity2			1
@entity6 ( pictured with her physiotherapist , @entity15 ) has discovered that listening to music helps her to cope with the symptoms of her @entity2 's disease but doctors were stunned when she realised her body responded to music with a ' marching ' beat - and she could walk around normally when listening to certain tunes			1
mrs @entity6 discovered the bizarre quirk when she told her physiotherapist she longed to ' have a little jig ' - and he found her an @entity26 with some tunes			1
she said : ‘ without the music , i 'm just somebody who has @entity2 's - with it , it 's like an instant fix			1
it 's like i 'm back in control of myself again			2
‘ i started with “ @entity4 ” by @entity5 , and then some marching music - and i found , with the right beat , i suddenly had control over what i did			2
‘ i could march backwards and forwards , i could jig on the spot and i could dance			0
‘ it only worked while the music was on and with certain songs but , with things like “ @entity4 ” , i could kick about and i just had this confidence i did n't have before			2
’ mrs @entity6 says one of the songs she finds most help is @entity5 's ' @entity4 '			1
image shows the band mud mrs @entity6 was told she had @entity2 eight years ago , after she found she was dragging her foot and noticed problems with her right hand			1
the disease often leaves her feeling unwell and struggling to move about the house			2
after her diagnosis , she was referred to the hospital for support on how to manage her condition			0
1 ) @entity59 - the @entity60 2 ) @entity61 3 ) @entity63 - @entity62 4 ) @entity64 and @entity65 - the @entity66 5 ) @entity68 - @entity67 this included a six - week course about the condition , medication , physiotherapy and advice from a dietician			0
but , some days , mrs @entity6 said @entity2 's left her feeling ‘ off - colour ’ and ‘ fragile ’ , with walking and even talking difficult			1
the pensioner said : ‘ to begin with , i was devastated and i was really worried about what having the condition would mean for me			0
‘ on top of that , i did n't like the idea of going to hospital regularly because of it			0
i really struggled with that and was plucking up the courage to go			0
’ as a result of the disease mrs @entity6 finds it extremely difficult to multi-task , and struggles with walking and talking at the same time			1
her husband @entity92 , 72 , said : ‘ there 's a lot of things you ca n't do when you have @entity2 's which i guess we would all take for granted			1
‘ so , for example , @entity6 ca n't multi-task very well			2
if we walk into the village and i talk to her , she has to stop before she can speak back			2
mrs @entity6 was diagnosed with @entity2 eight years ago and without music she struggled to walk , and even to talk			1
she says the music gives her a break from the symptoms ‘ if we go for a walk somewhere she has to constantly look down and pick her feet up over tree roots			2
’ but when mrs @entity6 puts on headphones and hears certain songs - in particular marching band music - her body responds and she has even able to dance			1
mr @entity116 said : ‘ @entity6 is always of good cheer but @entity2 's can sometimes , understandably , leave her feeling low			1
‘ but her eyes just seem to light up when the music plays			0
‘ when we go on a walk , it 's usually me leading the way and @entity6 dragging across the fields behind me but , with her headphones on , she walks like normal			1
mrs @entity6 says music helps her temporarily regain control of her body ‘ we ca n't explain it but it just has such an all - round positive effect on her			1
’ mrs @entity6 added : ‘ i like music with a deep , resounding beat but it 's got to be the right beat			1
‘ that 's why i like the marches so much			0
a strong beat and a good bass - those are the things which work best			0
parkinson 's disease is a condition in which part of the brain becomes progressively more and more damaged over many years			2
it causes involuntary shaking and tremors , muscle stiffness and a slowing down of the physical movements			0
it can also result in depression , daytime sleepiness and swallowing difficulties			0
parkinson 's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain			0
this leads to a reduction in the amount of a chemical called dopamine in the brain			0
this chemical plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body			0
it is not known exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells but a combination of genetics and environmental factors are thought to be responsible			0
about one in every 500 people develop parkinson 's disease and most people start to develop symptoms around the age of 60			0
one in 20 cases develop in people under the age of 50			0
there is no cure for @entity2 and it is not fatal so many patients have a near - normal life expectancy			1
however , it can cause severe disability in people who respond less well to treatment			0
source : @entity193 ‘ i 'm not as bothered about the lyrics ; it 's all about the music			2
it 's like the music lets me have a break			2
’ @entity15 , from the @entity2 's team at @entity202 's @entity201 , said they are extremely impressed with her progress			1
now they have applied for funding to carry out further research into the link between parkinson 's disease and music			1
ms @entity15 said : ‘ it really was miraculous to see			0
all of @entity6 's anxiety seemed to disappear with the music			1
‘ it was almost like the music freed up @entity6 's mind and took the effort away she normally faces when walking or talking			1
the music seemed to take over			0
’ she added that she had not seen anything like it before but had started using music to help other patients			2
she said : ‘ we know that using a metronome can sometimes help patients with @entity2 's			1
it 's a technique called cueing and , like the music , it helps with walking because it sets the pace			2
‘ but i ca n't quite find anyone using music quite like this and , when i showed videos of @entity6 's progress at a congress in @entity236 , they were fascinated			1
‘ i 've tried it since with four others , with different results			0
one gentleman did n't respond to marching music but did to “ @entity242 ) ” by the @entity243			0
‘ and another gentleman did get on well with the marching music and said it reminded him of his past			0
’ ms @entity15 and her team have now applied to @entity249 for £ 35,000 and the @entity250 , a charity which offers grants , for £ 36,000 to carry out research			0
the pilot study would aim to show music was more effective than a metronome in helping people with @entity2 's walk as well as looking at effects other symptoms , such as insomnia , difficulty swallowing , dementia and cognitive impairment			1
parkinson 's disease is an incurable neurological condition and symptoms include tremors , rigidity and slowness of movement			0
it can also cause tiredness , pain and depression .			0
