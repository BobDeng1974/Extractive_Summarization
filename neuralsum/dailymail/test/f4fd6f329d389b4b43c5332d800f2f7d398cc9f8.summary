flanked by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 jigged over to the travelling @entity4 supporters - the popular goalkeeping coach was in the mood to celebrate			1
after a first win in eight , they are back in this consuming promotion race and that six - week wobble is no longer			2
@entity2 lapped up the adulation , entertaining 4,000 behind one goal of the @entity13 at which the @entity14 wrapped up three crucial points			2
this felt very important indeed , the outpouring of each olé obvious			2
@entity4 's players celebrate after @entity21 's goal gave them the lead in the second half @entity24 was all smiles as he took his place in the stands before the game @entity29 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity30 ; @entity31 ( @entity32 63 ) , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 ( @entity40 75 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 65 )			1
subs not used : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47			2
booked : @entity31 , @entity39 @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity48 ; @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 88 ) ; @entity1 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity21 46 ) , @entity0 , @entity56 ( @entity57 90 ) ; @entity58			1

goals : @entity21 51 , @entity58 81			1
booked : @entity1 , @entity54			0
make no mistake , these have been tough times for @entity24			0
@entity70 of the tree back on february 24 , the @entity4 manager is now only looking at promotion via the play - offs , labelling an automatic spot a ‘ long shot ’			1
their ticket for those extra games is by no means booked , but goals from substitute @entity21 and @entity58 mean they are back on track			1
@entity21 climbed off the bench at half - time to change the game , slamming in the opener six minutes after the restart before @entity58 capitalised on shambolic defending to prod in a late second			1
‘ i did n’t think @entity21 would make the impact that he did , ’ @entity24 admitted after @entity21 ’s first appearance in almost two months			1
‘ he could only play 45 minutes			0
‘ it ’s a massive win			2
we showed the quality we ’ve been missing			0
the away following was absolutely incredible			0
’ @entity29 , by contrast , are staring at relegation and a first season in the third tier since 2003			1
now eight points adrift , their fans chanted for the head of @entity100			2
chairman @entity101 did n’t know where to look at full - time and they need two wins from trips to @entity106 and @entity107 - on friday and next tuesday respectively - to stand any chance of survival			0
@entity4 goalkeeper @entity48 does well to tip over a header from a @entity29 corner @entity4 winger @entity56 has a low effort saved by @entity29 goalkeeper @entity113 @entity54 rides a challenge from @entity115 international @entity116 ‘ it ’s still mathematically possible and we need to keep giving it everything we ’ve got , ’ @entity100 said			1
‘ it was criminal to miss those chances but that has haunted the club all season			0
‘ i thought we were terrific first half - 17 crosses into their box			0
that should bring a return of two goals			2
’ it did not , and @entity100 ’s use of ‘ mathematical ’ tends to suggest the writing is on the wall			0
@entity136 and @entity116 both went close but @entity29 ran out of steam , their fans streaming out after @entity58 ’s 81st - minute clincher			1
@entity116 shifted the ball to his left foot and found @entity136 , storming towards the six - yard box but the winger ’s bullet header was met in stature by @entity48 ’s splendid one - handed stop , tipping over while airborne			2
@entity56 had the beating of his man inside the box , but could only fluff right - footed straight at @entity113			0
@entity33 almost put through his own net from a @entity55 corner but those two moments were all @entity24 ’s side could muster before the break , finding the quagmire of a playing surface at the @entity13 quite a deterrent			0
this had been used for the @entity159 ’ win against @entity161 in their @entity163 encounter on @entity164 , and you could tell ; a tame @entity116 drive bobbled three times to test @entity48 when otherwise it would not have			2
but , frankly , that is the least of @entity29 ’s worries			1
they face an almighty task to escape relegation , made all the harder when @entity21 linked up with @entity0 to score			1
‘ the difference with him and without him shows you what a top striker can do , ’ @entity100 rued			0
@entity21 celebrates after giving @entity4 the lead in the crucial promotion clash @entity48 saves at the feet of @entity39 as relegation - threatened @entity29 press for a second - half equaliser it ’s 20 for the season now and how they have missed the @entity188 international ’s presence			1
he came on with purpose , knocked the normally immovable @entity33 from pillar to post and gave the @entity14 a focus			0
@entity56 just poked over the bar after super build - up involving @entity21 and @entity58 , before the on - loan @entity195 striker wrapped up the points after 81 minutes			1
@entity58 comes alive in the 18 - yard box and reacted quickest to @entity34 ’s terrible mix - up to add a second			1
@entity29 did have their chances			1
@entity38 was smothered brilliantly by @entity48 as the @entity202 international looked to equalise ; @entity37 then saw a half - volley superbly blocked by @entity1			0
they displayed guts , but not an awful lot of quality , and a first season below the top two divisions since 2003 looks to be the legacy created by @entity212 in controversially appointing @entity100			0
‘ we want @entity100 out , ’ was the summation of 10,000 home fans			0
five wins since taking over in november suggests they are right			0
substitute @entity58 puts the result beyond doubt by finishing from close range @entity4 heroes @entity58 and @entity21 celebrate after the former scored their second of the game			1

@entity4 had failed to win any of their previous seven games
goals from @entity21 and @entity58 lift them up to fifth
@entity29 now eight points from *safety* with just five games left
