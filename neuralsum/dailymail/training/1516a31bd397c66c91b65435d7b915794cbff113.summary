he has one of the most glamorous day jobs imaginable and rarely has it looked more appealing than this week			2
twelve months ago , @entity4 said that he had seen enough lawyers to last him a lifetime			1
so you can imagine what it has been like sitting in legal offices during the past six weeks poring over documents relating to his bitter dispute with his former management company , @entity14			1
‘ annoying and frustrating , ’ is how the 25 - year - old summed up being forced to sit out the first two events of the @entity18 ’s @entity17 in @entity19			2
it will be costly too , if he finishes on the losing side in the @entity24 courtroom showdown , scheduled for february			0
@entity4 signs the guest book at the official opening of the new clubhouse at @entity28 @entity4 is back on the golf course after a distracting few weeks focusing on a court case those in @entity32 who have been following the various machinations closely estimate he could be as much as £ 25million worse off if the worst - case scenario unfolds			1
‘ of course i ’m annoyed that it is still going on but there ’s nothing i can do about it , ’ @entity4 said			1
‘ we tried our best a few weeks ago to come to some sort of resolution and it did n’t work out			2
so yeah , it ’s not the best thing to be going through but it will be over and done with a good bit before i have to go down @entity46 ( for the masters ) in april			0
as long as i ’ve got a clear head going there , i ’m happy with that			0
’ while he was away @entity4 was formally declared the winner of the race to @entity53			1
and , free of legalese here for a few days at least , he will hope to add the season - finale @entity55 to his race win , as he did in 2012 , and be handed both prizes at sunday ’s presentation			1
‘ i ’m still very motivated to go out this week and perform well , ’ he said			2
‘ there would be no point me showing up if i thought i had already won something and was just here for a good time			2
it has been such a fantastic year i want to round things off and get two trophies rather than one			0
’ ' @entity69 , coach @entity70 , @entity4 and sports scientist @entity71 @entity4 in action during the pro-am event prior to the @entity55 in @entity53 earlier this week the blisters on @entity4 ’s right hand are evidence of how hard he has been working since arriving in @entity53 a week ago , as was a wonderful stroke he played on monday			1
the tour had organised for some of the leading players to replicate iconic shots in the tournament ’s history			0
they all got to try @entity87 ’s extraordinary three wood to the par five 18th a year ago that saw him wrap up the race to @entity53 with a tap - in eagle three			1
no - one got close			0
well , not until @entity4 casually coaxed yet another majestic fairway wood shot from 260 yards to within an arm ’s length of the hole			1
it underlined his liking for an @entity99 course where he has compiled some jaw - dropping figures			0
he is 74 under par for his 20 rounds of golf here , with nothing worse than a 72 — and only one of those			0
in the other 19 rounds , he has had five 66s , five 67s , two 68s , two 69s , and five 71s			0
and maybe those six weeks away will work in his favour			0
‘ i ’m sure there are some tired minds and bodies among the players who competed in the last three events in @entity19 and @entity115 and i am hoping to take advantage , ’ @entity4 said			2
he has also underlined his commitment to @entity119 golf			0
as the new host of the @entity121 , he has persuaded charismatic @entity123 @entity122 to pitch up at @entity124 next may			0
and the @entity125 in july will definitely form part of @entity4 ’s schedule in the build - up to the defence of his @entity121 title at @entity131			1
all good news surrounding the world no 1 , then , apart from that ugly legal battle			1
let ’s hope good sense prevails between now and next february , because the one certain loser if the combative lawyers get to stand on their feet will be the game itself			0
@entity4 won both @entity142 and the @entity143 during a dream year for the @entity145			1

@entity4 plays in @entity55 in @entity53 this week
@entity4 has already won @entity148 to @entity53
he could *reportedly* be as much as £ 25million worse off if the worst - case scenario unfolds and @entity4 loses his *current* court dispute
@entity4 spent last six weeks in legal battle with former management company , @entity14
