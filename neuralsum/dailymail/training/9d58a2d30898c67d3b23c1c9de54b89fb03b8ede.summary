being overweight can cost you dearly - both in terms of health and finances			2
researchers studying 150,000 @entity6 men that were obese aged 18 found they grew up to earn 16 % less than their peers of a normal weight			1
even people who were overweight at 18 , that is , with a body - mass index from 25 to 30 , saw significantly lower wages as an adult			1
a bulging waistline does not lead to a bulging wallet : researchers found in a study of 150,000 @entity6 men that were obese aged 18 grow up to earn 16 % less than their peers of a normal weight			1
the world has seen a remarkable increase in childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity , the researchers say			2
in the @entity25 , childhood obesity has tripled since the late 1970s			0
in @entity6 , where the study was carried out , there has been a fourfold increase between 1984 and 2000			1
it is estimated that worldwide , 150 to 160 million school - aged children were overweight in 2004 ; of these , about one - quarter were obese			1
researchers looked at @entity6 men who enlisted in compulsory military service in the 1980s and 1990s			1
obese 18 - year - old men will earn 16 percent less over their a lifetime than those of a normal weight , according to the study published in the research journal @entity41			1
this is roughly the same lifetime earnings penalty as missing about three years of college education , the researchers point out			0
' our empirical analysis provides four important results , ' the team say			0
' first , we provide the first evidence of a large adult male labor market penalty for being overweight or obese as a teenager			1
' second , we replicate this result using data from the @entity25 and the @entity54			0
' third , we note a strikingly strong within - family relationship between body size and cognitive skills / noncognitive skills			0
' fourth , a large part of the estimated body - size penalty reflects lower skill acquisition among overweight and obese teenagers			1
' taken together , these results reinforce the importance of policy combating early - life obesity in order to reduce healthcare expenditures as well as poverty and inequalities later in life			0
the team analyzed health and wage statistics for 150,000 @entity6 men who enlisted in mandatory military service at age 18 in the 1980s and 1990s			1
since obesity can be affected by factors like household income , the researchers controlled for family characteristics by only using men who had a brother also included in the study			2
this allowed researchers to compare heavier and thinner brothers who had the same family backgrounds , controlling for things like wealth , geography or ethnicity			0
even when brothers were compared , the researchers found that obesity correlated with lower earnings			2
researchers found that the heavier a person was , the more their earnings dropped			0
they hypothesized that the gap was due to obese teens not fully developing so - called ' non-cognitive ' skills , like confidence and self - motivation			2
the ' bullying , lower self - esteem , and discrimination by peers and teachers ' that these obese male teens experienced had a ripple effect through their future financial lives , according to the study			1
the researchers pointed out that this is not exclusively a @entity6 problem , as they found ' strikingly similar results using @entity25 and @entity54 data			2
' the study said that it is critical for countries to introduce policies and programs to combat childhood obesity , ' in order to reduce healthcare expenditures as well as poverty and inequalities later in life			0
' ' in sum , our results suggest that the rapid increase in childhood and adolescent obesity could have long - lasting effects on the economic growth and productivity of nations			0
the team analyzed health and wage statistics for 150,000 @entity6 men who enlisted in mandatory military service at age 18 in the 1980s and 1990s			1
' we believe that the rationale for government intervention for these age groups is strong because children and adolescents are arguably less able to take future consequences of their actions into account			0
' moreover , their choice of goods and physical activities is largely determined by the knowledge and preferences of parents , as well as by food supply and activities at school			0
' policies aimed at addressing the market failure associated with childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity hold great promise , and more research on cost - effective measures is warranted			0
