the chief executive of @entity1 believes information on missing aircraft @entity3 is being withheld by authorities			1
this was revealed in a formerly unpublished full transcript of an interview conducted by well - known aviation journalist @entity9 , which has been made available on the @entity11			1
sir @entity12 further questioned the role of the @entity15 military after the @entity17 flight disappeared on march 8 this year carrying 239 people , including six @entity19 , while en route from @entity20 to @entity21			1
the chief executive of @entity1 sir @entity12 believes information on missing aircraft @entity3 is being withheld by @entity15 authorities a @entity17 flight disappeared on march 8 2014 carrying 239 people , including six @entity19 , while en route from @entity20 to @entity21 ' i think we will know more if there is full transparency of everything that everybody knows			1
i do not believe that the information held by some is on the table , ' he said in the interview			2
' who actually disabled @entity41 [ the plane 's @entity39 and @entity42 ] , who knew how to do it ? ' if you eliminate the pilot on a suicide mission , i 'm sure you could have put the aircraft in the @entity48 , rather than fly it for seven hours			2
so if he was on a suicide mission , he would have done it then			0
who then took control of the aircraft ? who then knew how to disable acars and turn the transponder off ? that is a huge challenge			2
' when asked whether he can comprehend the mysterious disappearance of a plane in this day and age , sir @entity12 responded : ' @entity63 lies this huge question mark in my mind			1
i know this did not have to happen , there is technology to track these aircraft and everybody will say that , @entity72 or @entity73			0
' that is where the conundrum is of mystery , that is where we must be more forthright and candid as to what went on , it is not good enough for the @entity15 military to say : " on a prime radar we identified it as ' friendly ' "			0
' sir @entity12 , who 's airline @entity1 operates almost 130 @entity72 aircraft - similar to the doomed jet , added the role of the @entity15 military has been ' bizarre '			1
' this is a very busy part of @entity92 , the notion that we should not be able to identify if it is friend or foe , or we can on primary radar and do nothing about it , is bizarre , ' he said			0
' what would have happened if the aircraft would have turned back to fly into the @entity100 in @entity20 ? but we identified it as " friendly " ? friendly with intent , or friendly without intent ? but what was done ? these are the questions that need to be asked of the people and the entities that were involved in all of this			2
full transparency of that will help us to find out what went on			0
' in @entity9 's article , which was published for @entity116 magazine @entity115 last month , sir @entity12 also claimed that ' control was taken of ' @entity3 before it vanished			1
sir @entity12 said it was very important that the airline industry does not accept that the fate of @entity3 is an ' unexplained mystery '			1
' @entity3 remains one of the great aviation mysteries			2
personally , i have the concern that we will treat it as such and move on			0
at the most , it might then make an appearance on @entity129 as one of aviation 's great mysteries			0
we must n't allow this to happen			0
we must know what caused that airplane to disappear , ' sir @entity12 said			1
the chief executive of @entity1 - one of the world 's largest international airlines - said the industry must not accept @entity3 's a ' mystery ' earlier this week , the government created a video to explain to the heartbroken families of @entity3 victims why their loved ones have still not been found after eight months			1
in the four - minute video , posted by the @entity148 on @entity149 , authorities attempt to explain why the search mission has taken so long and why the search area continues to be based along the seventh arc in the southern @entity153 , an area with incredibly deep water and rough conditions			0
the arc is described as ' a thin long line that identifies all the possible points the last communication between the aircraft and the communication satellite could have taken place '			0
trying to calm recent fears that the @entity19 - led search operation in the southern @entity153 off the coast of @entity165 in @entity166 could be stopped , the video says : ' the expert satellite working group is continually refining analysis of the available data to identify the areas of the highest priority for the search			0
' relatives of @entity3 passengers were outraged last week after a senior @entity17 representative allegedly said the beleaguered carrier is planning on officially declaring the plane ' lost ' , which would call off the search .			2

there were 239 people on board the flight from @entity20 to @entity21
sir @entity12 has also said the somebody took control of the aircraft before it vanished
