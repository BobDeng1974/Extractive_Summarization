after nearly a decade of trying , @entity8 and @entity9 had almost given up hope of becoming parents and had resigned themselves to being childless			1
it was their first round of @entity14 that proved successful - quite spectacularly			1
and that is not the only reason the quads are extraordinary			2
incredibly , they are also the result of just one embryo after it split into three and then one of those embryos split into two			1
how they 've grown ! the famous @entity25 quads ( @entity26 ) @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity6 and @entity5 are today celebrating their first birthday the odds of one embryo creating four babies is likely to only happen once every 4,000 years , according to experts			1

' it ’s been an incredible first year , ' 44 - year - old @entity8 told @entity44			2

i ’d love to say it ’s got easier but it has n’t			2

like most young , married couples , they longed to start a family			2
‘ i ’d always wanted to be a mum , ’ @entity9 said at the time of the girl 's birth			1
‘ i do n’t come from a big family , but children were always on the agenda			2
we started trying before we got married , but nothing happened			2
‘ i was only 25 , so i did n’t panic			1
but after two years we went to our gp who did lots of tests			0
it turned out i had polycystic ovaries and would probably need help to get pregnant			0
supermarket sweep : trips to the supermarket are more fun - and their local has custom - built a four - seater trolley for their weekly shop quite a handful : the babies were getting through 200 nappies and are all lactose intolerant ‘ it was very upsetting			0
friends were getting pregnant and while i was always happy for them and never jealous , i would be thinking : “ why is n’t it happening for us ? ” ’ the couple tried several treatments , including the ovary - stimulating drug @entity99 , but the side - effects made @entity102 ‘ @entity14 was really a last resort because we knew what a rollercoaster it could be , ’ she says			1
‘ people do n’t understand unless they ’ve done it , and we discussed whether we wanted to put ourselves through it			0
it was our final hope			0
’ @entity8 and @entity9 were referred to @entity111 in @entity112 , and were offered two rounds of @entity14 on the @entity114			1

‘ we had more than 42 staff and took up two surgical theatres , ’ she says			0
‘ everyone wanted a front - row seat			0
when the babies came out , they were whisked into a side room and @entity8 went with them			0
‘ it was upsetting for me as i was desperate to see them , but i did n’t get anywhere near them for 24 hours			0
‘ @entity8 took 253 pictures of them to show me because i went straight to high dependency			0
the babies had bruised my lungs because they ’d been kicking me so hard			0
’ inseparable : the quads ' parents say the four girls do everything together troublemakers : ' they get up to all sorts of stuff together and always seem to encourage each other			2
it ¿ s brilliant to watch , ' said their father @entity9 left hospital a week later , but her daughters remained in special care for nine more weeks until they came home at the end of may			1
a year later , the lorry driver and his nurse wife @entity9 , 37 , say that the girls are all coming into their own and are gradually becoming self - sufficient			1

' they get up to all sorts of stuff together and always seem to encourage each other			0
