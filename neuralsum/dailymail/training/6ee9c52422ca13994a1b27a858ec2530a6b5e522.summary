by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:45 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 11 september 2013 everyone relishes that spark of falling in love for the first time			0
but , much as they try , few married couples get to feel it all over again			0
dosed up on morphine for a hernia operation , the love - struck @entity9 could n't believe his eyes when he caught sight of the woman by his bed			1
the video purportedly shows mr @entity8 meeting his wife all over again for the first time , but there 's now speculation over its authenticity			1
you 're the prettiest woman i 've ever seen			0
' are you a model ? who are you ? what 's your name ? ' the answer blew his mind			2
' i 'm your wife , ' she giggled			2
in a video that has now amassed more than 240,000 views , mr @entity8 's jaw drops			1
and he 's got a fair few more questions to ask			2
' you 're my wife ? ! ' the former missionary gasps , ' holy sh * * ! @entity54			2
how long ? ' @entity55 , the blonde beauty behind the lens , tries to encourage her husband of six years to eat a cracker as he recovers in an unidentified hospital			2
but he is too distracted			0
' it 's hard baby , it 's hard ... do we call each other baby ? ' dumbfounded , he clutches his head : ' man i hit the jackpot ! ' unaware : he wakes up writhing around in pain and calling for medicine			2
when @entity29 speaks he turns to look baffled : he gawps at the bedside beauty wanting to know if she is a model			1
he can not believe they are married now said to be recovered , mr @entity8 , vice president of sales at @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , is sticking to his every word			1
the former missionary for @entity80 said : ' i had a hernia repair to fix residual tears from a previous surgery			0
' i wish i could remember this but i was definitely out of it			0
' this was my fifth surgery within our six years of marriage and she 's been by my side through all of it			1
' in a previous surgery i suffered a severe complication and we did n't know if i 'd ever function the same again			0
' she is the love of my life			0
' the couple live in @entity77 , where mr @entity8 swapped medical school for business in 2010 after starting his own marketing company , @entity100			1
the start of the viral video purportedly shows a half - conscious mr @entity8 rolling around in pain asking for medicine			1
it is only when @entity29 offers to find a doctor that he turns to look at her			1
for the next three minutes of video , which will go down in family history , pain is the least of mr @entity8 's worries as he repeatedly exclaims : ' we 're married ? ! ' he ogles at @entity29 , wanting to know if they have children ( ' not yet ' ) , have they kissed ( ' just eat your cracker ' )			1
' i hit the jackpot ' : @entity8 can not believe his luck when he realises the bedside beauty is his wife , but did he recognise her all along ? after a few moments of contemplation he is inspired to investigate further : ' let me see your face			1
woah ! your teeth are perfect ! ' much to his disappointment , she refuses to ' turn around '			0
catching sight of her left hand he says : ' did i get you that ring ? @entity136 i must have been ... really liking you '			0
commenters flooded to praise the ' husband of the year ' on @entity140 after the video was posted on august 30			0
one person said : ' that guy studied ! ' another commented : ' this man is a friggin genius ! ' a yearning viewer said : ' why ca n't i find a guy like this ! ' applauding mrs @entity55 for her camerawork , one commenter said : ' i ca n't decide who is the genius of this operation			0
@entity8 , for saying this on camera or his wife for making sure it was documented ! ' not long after the video went viral , it received a flood of attention , but now some are doubting its validity			1
it has the looks of a hoax , according to a doctor who spoke to @entity169			0
explaining that there are two types of amnesia , dr. @entity170 , a psychologist at the @entity171 , says that neither of them would likely cause the type of memory loss allegedly suffered by mr @entity8			1
' the first type , psychogenic amnesia , is a psychiatric condition that can involve retrograde memory loss , but is n't associated with surgery , says dr @entity170			0
' the second , which is similar to @entity186 's , can be caused by a loss of oxygen during surgery , but mainly leads to difficulty learning new information , ' he adds			0
explaining that while retrograde memory ( that of past events ) can occur , dr @entity170 says it is unheard of for a six - year marriage to be wiped clean from a person 's memory			1
' it would not affect something so salient in a person 's life , ' said dr @entity170			0
another strike against the sensational video 's legitimacy is a head shot found of the suddenly coherent mr @entity8 on an acting audition website , the @entity169 post points out			1
one final item of note , the former actor has only one video uploaded to his @entity140 account , which @entity169 notes ' employs the easy - to - remember username ' @entity213			2

@entity8 is filmed in bed half - conscious after a hernia operation
@entity77 sales manager is seen gawping at @entity29 , his wife of six years
three minute video has gone viral with more than 240,000 views
despite all the attention , some are now questioning the video 's legitimacy
