if you 've ever wanted to have @entity3 's steely gaze or @entity5 's sultry stare , a new laser treatment could be the answer			1
a @entity8 company says it hopes to offer a $ 5,000 ( £ 3,400 ) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue , permanently			0
the technique , which is currently undergoing clinical trials , works by using something known as ' scavenger cells ' to digest and remove the pigment from the iris surface			1
a specific laser frequency passes through the clear cornea of the eye , before it is selectively absorbed by the dark pigment covering the iris the procedure applies a computer - guided , low - energy laser to the iris to disrupt the brown pigment			1

this causes the body to ' initiate a natural and gradual tissue - removal process			1

' under every brown eye is a blue eye , ' dr @entity46 , chairman and chief scientific officer at @entity48 said			1

according to @entity48 , the process takes 30 seconds , and around two weeks eyes become blue			1
so far , 17 patients in @entity81 and 20 in @entity82 have undergone the treatment			1
the company hopes to trial a total of 100 patients over the next few years			0

a @entity8 company says it will soon be offering a $ 5,000 ( £ 3,400 ) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue , permanently @entity97 , an ophthalmologist at the @entity98 , told @entity99 that the procedure could clog up the eye 's normal drainage channels			0
this can in turn cause the pressure inside the eye to go up , ' he said			0
' if that happens significantly enough , for long enough , it 's how patients develop glaucoma , ' he said			0
' we were concerned about this issue right from the start , so it was the first issue we tested and measured in our initial pre-clinical and clinical studies , ' the company wrote on their site			0
' thus far , pigmentary glaucoma has not proved to be a problem in our pre-clinical or clinical studies			0
' dr @entity123 , an optometrist and clinical services director at @entity124 , a nationwide laser vision correction specialist , says that there are fundamental differences between the @entity129 laser procedure and corrective laser eye surgery			2
by removing the pigment , light can enter small fibres in the eye			0
when the light scatters , it only reflects back the shortest wavelengths , which appears blue the basic rule of thumb is that as soon as you go inside the eye with a laser , you can cause more damage , ’ he says			2
‘ we only use lasers on the cornea , the surface of the eye			0
this new treatment involves using a laser inside the eye			2
’ ' our procedure is limited to the treatment of stromal pigment , ' dr @entity46 told @entity154			2
' it does not dislodge or even contact any of the the " iris pigment epithelium " or @entity157 on the back side of the iris			2
' in addition , our procedure does not actually remove any pigment			2
' the proof , as they say , is in the pudding			0
we are now well into our clinical trials , and thus far , there has been no intraocular pressure increase in any subject			1
' but it may be the moral question which gives people most pause for thought			0
dr @entity46 , who has @entity175 roots himself , rejects he is promoting blue eyes over brown			1
‘ i ’ve heard the eugenics remark a few times , but i do n’t understand it			0
is the charge that there is something racist about giving people the option to have blue eyes ? ’			2

a low - energy laser is applied to the iris to disrupt the brown pigment
this causes body to *trigger* ' scavenger cells ' to remove dark colours
process takes 30 seconds , and two weeks later eyes will become blue
17 patients in @entity81 and 20 in @entity82 have undergone treatment
process , which is undergoing clinical trials , has raised *safety* concerns
