@entity0 of @entity1 has lipoedema for nearly as long as she can remember , @entity0 has had big legs in comparison with the rest of her body			1
' i 've always had a flat stomach and a small chest , and i 'm slim enough that you can see my hip bones sticking out a bit , ' says the 32 - year - old director of a market research company , who lives in @entity16 , @entity1			1
' but even though my waist is no bigger than 30 in , each of my thighs is about the same , and my calves are 18 in			1
' my legs are like tree trunks all the way down to my ankles , then i have a ring where it always looks as if i 've been wearing tight socks			1
' @entity0 had assumed she was ' just a fatty ' and when she hit her teens , she started to pay more attention to what she ate			1
' i got into the habit of not eating much at all - just an apple and a bit of cheese and bread now and then			1
' i got down to a size ten on top , but had legs that looked as if they should belong to a much bigger person			1
' to disguise this , she wore trousers rather than skirts and over the years continued to diet , trying everything from @entity48 and @entity49 to meal replacement drinks , but nothing shifted the fat on her lower limbs			2
' in 2010 , i basically did n't eat for two months , ' says @entity0 , who lives with her boyfriend @entity54 , who runs a business making corsets			1
' i tracked my measurements at various points on my legs during the process , and though i dropped more than two stone overall - going from 13 st to 10 st 8lb and losing five inches from my waist - my legs stayed the same size			1
' finally , in april , she had a lightbulb moment when her boyfriend came across an internet article on a condition called lipoedema			1
' @entity54 said : " i think this is you			2
" i told him to stop being cheeky - my legs were n't nearly as big as those of the girl 's in the picture			1
' but when i read it , i realised he might be right			2
and i was relieved to discover i had an actual medical condition and that i was n't the only one			2
' @entity77 is an abnormal distribution of fat that mainly causes the legs - and sometimes also the arms - to gradually become enlarged , says @entity82 , a gp in @entity84 , @entity85 , and medical consultant to the charity @entity77 @entity87			1
both legs tend to be enlarged at the same time and to the same extent			1
those with the condition have an excess number of fat cells in affected areas , as well as a build - up of fluid in those cells			1
' a wide variety of numbers are quoted as to how many people are affected - some studies say as many as 11 per cent of all women have it , ' says dr @entity82			1
it is not clear what causes it , though it does run in families - ' though only on the female side , ' he adds			1
the condition which involves an abnormal build - up of fat cells in the thighs , buttocks and legs @entity0 's mother 's legs are slim , but she has female cousins with legs similar to hers , always referred to affectionately within her family by their cousins ' surname as ' @entity129 legs '			1
dr @entity82 says : ' it usually manifests itself after puberty or pregnancy , probably for hormonal reasons			0
typically , a young girl will go to the gym or a @entity137 class and notice her legs are bigger than those of her peers , especially if she is slim elsewhere			2
' that may be what causes her to see her doctor			0
' a survey of 250 sufferers by @entity149 found that only 5 per cent had the condition diagnosed by their gp , and though most had experienced symptoms since their teens , the average age of diagnosis was 44			0
many patients claim they are simply told they are overweight - often prompting a cycle of weight loss that fails to budge the fat on their legs			1
this is because weight loss can not reduce the number of fat cells			0
the condition is often confused with lymphoedema , a more widely recognised condition in which disruption to the lymphatic system - which drains excess fluid from the body - causes swelling in the arms and legs			1
one key difference is that lipoedema patients typically have an ' ankle bracelet ' effect , where excess fat stops just before the feet			2
doctors are unsure why the fat is distributed in this way			0
@entity183 , a consultant vascular surgeon at @entity184 , says : ' there are no definitive tests for lipoedema , so it 's diagnosis by exclusion			2
' we would typically exclude lymphoedema by doing a clinical examination and a lymphoscintigram - a test that involves injecting a radioactive tracer into the lymphatic system to see how well it moves			2
' the difficulty is that some lipoedema patients develop an element of lymphodema , too , known as lipo - lymphoedema			1
' the pressure of the fat tissue can obstruct the lymphatics , so you end up with a combination of the two , ' says mr @entity183			0
both conditions are treated and managed in a similar way			0
lymphatic drainage massage involves a physiotherapist manually squeezing fluid out of the fat cells and into the blood vessels			0
it 's not a cure , but something to be done at regular intervals			0
patients can also wear compression hosiery that helps to reduce the amount of fluid in fat cells			0
low - impact exercise , such as swimming , may help to stimulate the movement of fluid and does n't put too much pressure on the joints			2
patients claim they are told they are overweight @entity77 patients may experience joint pain , particularly in the knees , perhaps due to the extra leg weight they are carrying			0
those affected may want a more permanent cure			0
however , mr kyriakides cautions against opting for surgical treatments such as liposuction			0
' with standard liposuction you put big cannulas - tubes that allow fluid to be removed - into the deeper tissues and suck out a lot of fat			1
but this can damage lymphatic drainage from the leg , which can trigger lymphoedema			0
' there is evidence that another type of liposuction - tumescent liposuction - can be effective and spare the lymphatic channels			2
this involves pumping in a liquid solution that provides local anaesthetic and creates a ' buffer ' separating the superficial layer of fat from the deeper tissues , where the lymphatic channels are , says mr @entity183			0
' you then suck out the fat cells with micro cannulas			0
it 's easier to do on the upper leg , where there is more loose tissue			0
' but while i can understand the principle of tumescent liposuction , those who get this treatment are n't necessarily made aware that they should continue to have lymphatic drainage massage or compression			0
all liposuction does is remove some fat cells - it does n't stop the other fat cells in the area storing more fluid , so the problem may return			2
' at one point , @entity0 , who is actively involved with @entity77 @entity87 , considered paying to have standard liposuction , until she learnt of the risks			1
she is concerned that patients are not receiving the correct information about what does and does n't work , and that effective surgical measures are not available on the @entity291			0
' our charity knows of only one surgeon who does the right sort of liposuction - and he is based in @entity296			2
' yet when it comes to lipoedema , @entity87 conservatism in treating it may be a good thing , says @entity300 , a lecturer in human genetics at @entity302 , @entity85 , who is doing research into lymphoedema			2
' there may be places that are willing to offer treatments			0
but if you do n't have the biological understanding to back it up , you might make it worse			0
as we do n't yet know the underlying cause , it 's difficult to progress to knowing how best to treat it			0
' when @entity0 went to her gp , he had never heard of lipoedema			1
' i asked to be referred to a lymphoedema centre six months ago , but have still heard nothing , ' she says			0
' i ended up going to @entity322 last month to get an official diagnosis from a specialist , who finally confirmed that i have the condition			0
' it means @entity0 , who also has an element of the condition in her upper arms , has n't yet had any form of treatment			1
meanwhile , @entity77 @entity87 , with the @entity332 , has launched an online course to raise awareness of the condition among family doctors			0
' some people do n't realise they have it until their 70s - having spent their whole lives being fobbed off with being told they need to diet more and do more exercise , ' says @entity0			1
' this needs to stop			0
