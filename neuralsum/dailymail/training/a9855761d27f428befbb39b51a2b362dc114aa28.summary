the @entity37 reports that before that arrest , @entity38 directed tens of thousands of dollars - worth of legislative grants to @entity41 , a group founded by @entity6 in 2006 which was supposed to help single parents			2
he has served on the board of the group - which does not have it 's own website - since he founded the charity in 2006 and has been the chairman since 2009			2
questions started being raised in 2011 - a year after he was elected to the @entity48 - when the @entity49 inquired about how the $ 33,000 grant was being spent but they never got a response			0
according to state records , the $ 33,000 in question was earmarked by @entity55 's former boss in 2008			0
dealings : investigators claim @entity6 ' former boss directed funds to a fake not - for - profit that @entity6 launched in 2006 and @entity6 has repeatedly refused to hand over forms accounting for where the money went when the @entity49 never got a response or the specific accounting of how the money was spent that they had asked for , so they referred the case to @entity2 attorney general @entity71 's office			1
that same year , @entity6 pled guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief in an unrelated incident that happened more than a decade earlier			0
he admitted that he stole and damaged property in relation to a business dispute in 1998 , and was ordered to pay restitution and do community service for three days			0
@entity71 's office teamed up with the @entity81 's office and issued a subpoena in february 2012 after another letter demanding the funds be accounted for or repaid went ignored again			2
@entity6 met with investigators from the attorney general 's office that february and brought no such documentation			1
the @entity14 cites court papers that say he only brought one undated invoice for $ 980 but it was unclear when that money was even spent			0

punishment : both @entity6 ( left ) and his relative @entity7 ( right ) face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail if they are found guilty on their most serious charge - grand larceny the nature of the relationship between @entity6 and @entity7 remains unclear , but @entity105 is being called @entity6 â€™ relative and is charged with conspiring with him on the grand larceny scheme			1
if convicted of grand larceny , both men face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail			1
in a joint release from the attorney general and the comptroller 's office , officials said that @entity6 and @entity105 have been indicted for allegedly pocketing about $ 30,000 in both grant money and public campaign funds			1
it goes on to specify that the @entity120 handed his staff $ 11,500 in funds that matched the amount he raised through public campaigning			0
he claimed that the money was paid to @entity126 , a campaign literature translation and distribution service , but the investigators assert that it is simply a shell company			0
from there , @entity105 allegedly transferred the funds to @entity41 and @entity6 withdrew cash from those accounts , which he then used to buy personal items like a $ 750 @entity138 bag			1
' the crimes mr. @entity6 is accused of committing represent a shameful breach of the trust his constituents placed in him , ' attorney general @entity71 said in the statement			2
' @entity2 are repeatedly asked to have faith in our leaders , and it appears that faith has been shattered once again			0
every time my office arrests a corrupt public official , it sends the message that elected office does not come with a blank check or a license to break the law			0
