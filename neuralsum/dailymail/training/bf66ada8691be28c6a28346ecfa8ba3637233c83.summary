it 's always been @entity2 's job to be the more rock n ' roll version of its saturday night , big arena counterpart			1
the quirky use of music , voiceovers and graphics likes to play with convention			0
and on sunday night , they really pushed the boat out by inviting @entity14 's most famous fan - with - a - band to take the middle seat in pundit corner			1
musician and @entity14 fan @entity18 made his first appearance on @entity2 @entity23 ( left ) , @entity18 ( middle ) and @entity22 ( right ) appeared on sunday night 's show in fact , the trio sitting opposite @entity26 looked like they could just as easily be about to share their thoughts with us on the latest floor - fillers from the hit parade			1
@entity23 , to @entity18 's right , would make a perfectly good ex-boy band member			1
while @entity22 to his left looked like he could be about to take the @entity37 back out on the road again			1
but as @entity26 pointed out , it was @entity18 's ' fan 's eye view ' that he was there for			1
which included being filmed on a very successful trip to see his team take @entity46 apart at the @entity47			0
after we 'd seen @entity18 leaping about in the stands , @entity26 asked him back in the studio if he missed being just in amongst the fans ? the 47 - year - old was in good spirits on the @entity55 's football highlights programme @entity18 was n't impressed with @entity57 boss @entity56 's appeared continued dig at refeeres ' you sign too many autographs ' , replied @entity18 , clearly as someone wanting to keep his eye on the action			1
' although he did add ' ( there 's ) champagne in the director 's box ... and they 've got these heated seats			2
' having appeared to be something of the angry and cynical young pop star , @entity18 seems to have turned into a musician and grown - up who has no trouble keeping a twinkle in his eye nowadays			1
we saw that working well last november in his little @entity78 derby - day battle with @entity79			0
and once again here he proved to be insightful , knowledgeable and witty			0
he warmed up for his contribution to the show by eulogising ' the @entity82 ' - better known to you and me as @entity86 manager @entity85			2
@entity18 joked that if he was the referee he 'd send @entity87 ( right ) off before he put his boots on @entity18 referred to @entity86 manager @entity85 as ' the @entity89 ' on sunday night 's programme ' one should never underestimate the @entity82 ' was @entity18 's prophetic advise about him and his resurging @entity86 team , before proclaiming ' power to the @entity94 ! '			1
this he did as part of a theme that he was to pursue throughout the night			2
namely , have a pop at @entity46			0
because @entity18 was all about @entity86 staying in the top four , so as to keep @entity99 out of it			2
he then went on to point out , quite reasonably , that managers should take some responsibility in the issue of how to improve refereeing			0
he also said he would n't mind having a go on the whistle himself			0
but mainly , it would seem , because ' @entity87 ( would ) be getting sent off before he put his boots on '			0
he was also quite happy to offer to sit alongside sir @entity107 on the show should he be required to do so			0
i imagine a call was put into the @entity107 household immediately			0
there were also a few words to be had about @entity56 , particularly for his ' digging out of referees '			0
but he did still concede that he thought it was going to be @entity57 's title , if only ' by two or three points , though '			1
which must have been particularly galling for him			0
because when @entity26 asked him - at the end of a most entertaining programme that he fully contributed to - if seeing his team win the @entity122 was his ultimate ambition , @entity18 pondered for a moment and replied ' if i 'm honest , i 'd like to win the @entity126 more '			1
which would be definitely , then , @entity18 ? no , maybe ?			2

@entity18 was a pundit on @entity2 on sunday night
@entity23 and @entity22 also appeared on the show
it was @entity134 's first time on the show
the @entity14 fanatic conceded he *believed* @entity57 would pip @entity139 's men to the @entity126 title this season
