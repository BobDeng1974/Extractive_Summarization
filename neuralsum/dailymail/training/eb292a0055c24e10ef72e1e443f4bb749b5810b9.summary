@entity0 will make his 500th appearance as @entity3 captain against @entity4 on saturday ! he ’s one of those players i look at and think : ‘ i wish i ’d had the chance to play with you			1
’ if @entity0 had been at @entity10 when i was there , we ’d have won titles			2
we were a @entity0 away from being the best team in the country			2
influential @entity3 skipper @entity0 lifts his third @entity16 title for the @entity17 in may 2010 @entity0 , celebrating the recent 2 - 0 win over @entity20 , will captain @entity3 for the 500th time on saturday three @entity16 titles one @entity23 medal one @entity25 medal five @entity28 winner 's medals two @entity29 @entity30 the way he plays , the way he organises , the way he leads his team ... to have captained @entity3 , at the highest level , for 500 games is an achievement deserving of great praise			1
he ’s the best i have ever seen at defending the near post , reading the danger and taking a position to deal with the threat			0
he reads the problem and assesses the angle			0
his positional play , overcoming a lack of pace , and his skill remind me of @entity48			0
before anyone takes offence at that comparison , @entity48 was - of course - a different type of defender and @entity56 ’s @entity55 - winning captain , but he too had to rely on his magnificent reading of the game			0
the 33 - year - old , despite being suspended for the final , lifts the @entity23 title for @entity3 in 2012 a banner reads ' captain , leader , legend ! ' as the @entity66 faithful show their admiration for @entity0			1
