anyone who knows @entity1 will tell you that @entity4 ’s head coach is a lovely guy			1
@entity5 , brilliant company , great stories			2
frankly , that does n’t make you the man to remain in the most prestigious football job in this country			2
this is a resignation issue			2
@entity4 are as good as out of a @entity12 after two group games			1
it is a modern - day football scandal			2
we thought that wretched 4 - 1 defeat against @entity17 in @entity18 four years ago was bad			1
somehow , this was even worse			0
this defeat , with @entity21 allowed to trample all over @entity4 ’s defence , hurts more than any other because we could all see it coming			1
next stop is @entity45 and after that @entity46 , where @entity37 chairman @entity47 has set the national team the target of winning the tournament			0
not going to happen out there , @entity47			0
how about we set out to win the tournament at hand with the country ’s best players available playing in the best positions and worry about the big picture another time ? @entity59 told us that this was the best @entity4 team he has ever been involved with and we ’re meant to keep a straight face			1
consoled : @entity4 's tormentor @entity21 talks to captain @entity62 flashback : @entity4 's 4 - 1 defeat by @entity17 in 2010 was an all - time low at a @entity12 everybody knows that five - year plans , master plans and @entity37 inquiries keep people who should n’t be in high profile positions in high profile positions			1
this effort really is shameful			0
we have been looking forward to a @entity12 in @entity74 for an entire lifetime and the chances are that we will never be back here again before we meet our makers			1
think about that for a moment			0
with the exception of holding the tournament in @entity4 , playing the @entity12 here is as close as it gets to footballing utopia			1
instead , after our final group game against @entity87 in @entity88 next week , the chances are that the squad will be on the first flight out of here			0
it is incredible to think that captain @entity62 and @entity1 told us that there were no special plans in place to stop one of the world ’s leading strikers			1
is this for real ? were they being serious ? it can not be so			0
say it ai n’t so			0
undercooked : @entity1 's side could n't handle the heat against @entity105 and @entity106 in testing conditions all alone : @entity1 looks on during @entity4 's 2 - 1 loss to @entity106 knowing a @entity12 exit is close uphill battle : @entity4 never managed to get their nose in front against @entity105 or @entity106 embrace : @entity1 ( right ) talks to @entity106 head coach @entity114 before the game in @entity116 every man jack around this camp over the past few days knew how much it would mean for @entity21 to bully @entity4 out of the tournament			1
well he has just done it			0
@entity4 ’s defence was embarrassing , unable to cope at the elite level against @entity105 and now @entity106			1
until we understand what it means for the @entity124 to slip on that jersey and belt out the national anthems we will never stand a chance on this continent and neither will our coach			0
you can bang on about technique and tactics as much as you like , but you have to understand that these @entity124 kids are off the streets			0
they play from the heart			0
it is different for them , it really is			0
beating @entity4 is better than anything , just talk to them for a few minutes and you understand that and be wowed by it			1
did we really think @entity4 could turn up in @entity116 , where @entity106 forward @entity146 plays his club football with @entity148 , and get away with it ? not on your life			1
tormentor : @entity21 was the star of the show as @entity106 beat @entity4 in @entity116 heart breaker : @entity21 scored his second and the winner for @entity106 with five minutes to play great debate : the decision on where to play @entity59 , if at all , gave @entity1 a big headache like most managers at the highest level , @entity1 cracked at the crucial moment in the build - up to the @entity12			1
it gets to them all			0
four years ago his predecessor @entity167 lost the plot when he attempted to bring @entity169 out of international retirement and messed about with the @entity4 captaincy			1
by the time the @entity173 was unveiled on the eve of the tournament in @entity176 , team spirit had been blown to bits			0
@entity178 , when @entity1 was parachuted in to replace @entity167 , was meant to be the head coach ’s free pass in his first tournament			1
we would judge him at the @entity12 — and let ’s not start rewriting history with some baloney about the young players benefiting from tournament experience			2
whatever you make of @entity4 and these two defeats here , please do n’t buy that argument			2
@entity1 got carried away with the idea that a young team could cope with tournament conditions in a difficult , but beautiful , country			2
to the future : @entity197 is one of a number of young players @entity4 possess perhaps he believed , when @entity4 drew 2 - 2 in the @entity200 last june against @entity74 , that his defence would be good enough at the @entity12			1
he called that wrong because @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 were in the team that afternoon			0
surely @entity1 , with all his experience at international level , would know other teams do n’t take friendlies anywhere near as seriously as we do			2
a 2 - 2 draw for @entity74 is chicken feed compared to when the @entity12 comes around			1
when it does , the top players — @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity21 — come alive			2
that is why they are in the elite bracket			0
over the coming days there will be many mea culpas and lots of people from the @entity37 pretending that all is well with the world			0
well actually , no it ’s not .			0

@entity4 are on the brink of being eliminated from @entity12 2014 after losing to @entity106 2 - 1
@entity21 scored @entity106 's two goals and exposed @entity4 's *defensive* *frailties*
questions will be asked of manager @entity1 and his *ability* to take the @entity4 forward
