the @entity1 has 40 @entity3 agents canvassing @entity4 , @entity5 to learn whether a white police officer should be charged with a ' civil rights ' crime for shooting an unarmed black teen , the agency confirmed on tuesday			1
reporters in @entity5 have tallied up stories from at least 12 witnesses who back the account of @entity4 police officer @entity14 , who shot @entity15 , 18 , last week			1
still , a civil rights verdict against @entity14 could subject him to execution under federal law			1
the @entity1 is conducting interviews with an eye toward determining if a federal case will be made of the shooting , regardless of whether the state of @entity5 charges @entity14 with murder or manslaughter			1
it 's conceivable that he might not be charged for killing the teen , but still face a trial in federal court for violating his civil rights			2
' and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section , ' the law reads , offenders can be ' imprisoned for any term of years or for life , or both , or may be sentenced to death			0
' attorney general @entity33 will pay a visit to the @entity5 flashpoint zone on wednesday			1
' i intend to meet with @entity3 investigators , and prosecutors on the ground from the @entity71 and @entity73 officials about the ongoing investigation , ' @entity33 said monday in a statement			1
' as i informed the president this afternoon , the full resources of the @entity1 are being committed to our federal civil rights investigation into the death of @entity15			1
' ' during the day today , ' he added , ' more than 40 @entity3 agents continued their canvassing of the neighborhood where @entity15 was shot			2
' @entity15 's grandfather also demanded on monday that @entity44 visit him there personally , but @entity44 had dodged a question hours earlier about whether he 'll make the trip			1
and @entity89 in @entity90 are reluctant to ask the president to go – sticking with political loyalties instead of putting him on the hot seat			0
@entity95 spoke to @entity96 on @entity97 monday night , saying that @entity44 owes him a visit to calm the waters after his grandson met his end on a @entity4 street after an alleged strong - arm robbery			1
' @entity46 is built on people coming together at times like this , and now is the time for my president to step forward , ' @entity95 told the community organizer - turned - tv - host			0
' i want to say this to my president : i voted for you , so you ought to be able to meet with me			2
' so far , though , @entity44 's allies in the @entity114 are declining the opportunity to pressure him into going			1
@entity116 grandfather ( at right ) challenged president @entity44 to meet with him in @entity4 , @entity5 , despite his apparent lack of enthusiasm for making the trip battle lines : @entity44 says he wants to be careful about weighing in on the controversy , but many in @entity4 are making their opinions known @entity44 himself ducked the question on monday during a press conference at the @entity128 after a reporter asked him , ' have you considered going yourself ? ' he dodged by suggesting he did n't want to get directly involved when a federal investigation into the shooting is underway			1
' i have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed , ' the president said			0
instead , he said his role would be ' to get at those root causes ' of race - based civil unrest – a nod to his ' @entity143 ' initiative , aimed at black men			0
@entity44 is sending attorney general @entity33 to @entity4 in his stead			1
the nation 's top law enforcement official – also , like @entity44 , an @entity148 – will arrive wednesday			2
@entity149 reached out to a dozen members of the black caucus , all @entity148 federal lawmakers			0
none would offer even a hint of suggestion that @entity44 should make the trip himself , and none would speak on the record			2
@entity5 rep. @entity159 said monday on @entity97 that ' i do n't think the president needs to come to @entity4			1
' it adds another distortion			0
we do n't need that now			0
' but that has been the only weigh - in from a black member of @entity90 , even as the @entity170 suburb 's streets have become a virtual war zone amid racial tensions			0
all the chaos , one congressional aide to a @entity114 member told @entity149 , is leading congressmen and women to keep their powder dry			0
standing room : reporters crowded into the @entity128 briefing room on monday to hear a haggard and detached @entity44 call for peace ' no one wants to be the one who demands @entity44 come down there , and then things get worse			2
everybody loses that way , and this is a killer election year , ' the staffer said on condition of anonymity			2
four press secretaries said plainly , but only on background , that their bosses would be steering clear of the controversy entirely			0
@entity15 , 18 , was shot six times as he allegedly charged a white police officer , drawing riots from the black community in @entity4 – and an aggressive police reaction complete with military vehicles and arms provided by the federal government			1
a tired - looking @entity44 said monday that the law enforcement 's paramilitary show of force could indicate that the @entity208 has gone too far in outfitting police forces with surplus gear			1
' there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement , and we do n't want those lines blurred , ' the president said at the @entity128			2
' that would be contrary to our tradition			0
' but he has no plans to visit what has become the latest @entity223 in @entity46 's continuing racial divide			0
protesters , police there have said , have come from as far away as @entity228 and @entity229 to engage in angry demonstrations and confront police			0
as many as 31 were arrested monday night , according to in - charge @entity233 capt. @entity232			0
a reporter tweeted a photo of a card that @entity3 agents are handing out near the scene of the @entity15 shooting			0

government *dragnet* descends on @entity4 looking for a federal *criminal* case ; the federal statute allows for the execution of offenders who kill
prosecutors would have to show police officer @entity14 intentionally targeted @entity15 because he was black
@entity44 is hedging on whether he 'll show up personally at the site of @entity5 race riots ; ag @entity33 will go on wednesday
slain black teen 's grandfather *insists* that the president should make the trip : ' i voted for you , so you ought to be able to meet with me '
*democrats* in the @entity114 wo n't pressure the @entity128 and are *avoiding* the issue in a tough election year
