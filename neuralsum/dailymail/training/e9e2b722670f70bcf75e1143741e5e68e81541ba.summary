the mysterious @entity1 sightings in @entity2 around the 1950s have been explained by mysterious tweet from the @entity5			1
the @entity5 gained 35,000 followers in the first half an hour they joined @entity8 last month and now have more than 630,000 followers			1
now the spy agency have helped solved what was a strange series of sightings in @entity13 over 60 years ago			2
at the time @entity13 documented what they believed were alien spacecrafts soaring across the sky			0
makes sense : there were a series of @entity1 sightings in @entity13 in the 1950s			0
but with one post on @entity8 , the @entity5 have explained them , saying they were merely testings of @entity25 reconnaissance planes , such as the one pictured the @entity5 tweets an explaination for some @entity1 sightings in the 1950s , complete with an official document but thanks to one tweet , the @entity5 have explained exactly what was happening			1
' do you remember the reports of unusual activity in the sky in the 50 's ? that was us , ' the @entity8 said			0
attached to the tweet was a government writeup about the sightings , showing that they were actually test flights of @entity25 reconnaissance planes			1
the planes flew above 60,000 feet , which was n't thought possible at the time , so commercial pilots who saw something so far above them could n't explain it			0
the effect was more pronounced at different times of the day and night , and if the @entity25 planes caught the rays of the sun , people on the ground were able to see silvery glints of light			0
the @entity25 is a high altitude reconnaissance aircraft that reaches altitudes above 70,000 feet the explanation was kept classified for decades to keep the spy programme a secret from the @entity65 during the @entity66 , according to the @entity67			2
it is yet another tweet that caused a social media from the @entity5 since they joined @entity8			1
the agency joined the network in june with this script : ' we can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet			0
