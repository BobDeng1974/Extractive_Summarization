by @entity0 , showbusiness editor published : 17:54 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 17:55 est , 16 november 2013 star : @entity2 has hit back at her critics by revealing her down - to - earth nature , and her yearning to start a family she has been branded ruthlessly ambitious and a prima donna			1
but now @entity2 has hit back at her critics by revealing her down - to - earth nature – and her yearning to start a family			1
in a candid interview with @entity10 , the 33 - year - old superstar talks of her struggle with the dark side of fame , and how her favourite gig of the year is a @entity17 singalong with her family in a @entity20 pub. the mezzo - soprano , who has just returned from a tour of @entity23 to prepare for a festive performance at @entity26 ’s @entity25 , said the highlight of her year is returning to her mother ’s house at @entity17			1
@entity2 also disclosed that she hopes to take a break soon to have children			1
‘ at some point in the next couple of years i ’d like to have a family and hopefully be able to combine that with my music , ’ she said			2
‘ that ’s something that i really hope will happen			2
i might have to cut back on the travelling , for a couple of years anyway			2
’ the singer was less forthcoming about who the father of her children may be , but she remains close to prince @entity45 ’s stockbroker friend @entity44 , whom she reportedly began dating in march			1
she was keen , however , to stress that despite leading a glamorous lifestyle , she has never been comfortable with all the attention			1
one example of the type of scrutiny she faces came when commentators criticised her for wearing make - up while running the @entity54 this year in aid of @entity56 – despite the fact she raised £ 26,000 in memory of her father , who died of lung cancer when she was 15			1
‘ i would say that by nature i ’m a sensitive person , and i certainly did n’t come into this for fame , ’ she said			2
‘ i wanted to be a classical singer and when i was training to do this , classical singers were n’t celebrities , so i really just wanted to sing			0
‘ i was n’t looking to be famous or to be photographed leaving a restaurant – that never occurred to me			1
so dealing with this kind of career path where people have got a perception of you that sometimes could n’t be further from the truth is weird			0
it can be odd and sometimes it ’s upsetting			0
‘ fortunately my mum is amazing , and she will say , “ do n’t worry , we all know the truth , come back to @entity81 and i ’ll give you a cutch ” – that ’s @entity81 for a cuddle ! ’ romantic link : @entity2 is said to be dating @entity44 , second from left , who is a friend of @entity45 last year @entity2 was dogged by claims that she was determined to ‘ crack ’ @entity91 when she appeared on @entity89 , the @entity91 version of @entity92			1
but she explained that she received an invitation to participate out of the blue and took it because it came during a difficult time in her personal life			0
‘ it was n’t the big masterplan that everybody thought it was , ’ she said			0
‘ i read people saying i was trying to conquer @entity91 , and that i ’d set this up months in advance – but they approached me in the middle of february and by the end of that month i was flying out there			0
good cause : @entity2 raised £ 26,000 for @entity56 by running the @entity54 this year dancing queen : last year @entity2 was dogged by claims that she was determined to ' crack ' @entity91 when she appeared on @entity89 , the @entity91 version of @entity92 , where she partnered dancer @entity112 ‘ i was in a strange personal place at the time , and i thought , “ i really fancy going away ”			2
’ the upcoming @entity17 break will be a rare treat for @entity2 , who has spent most of the year travelling the globe , most recently performing in the @entity117 with tenor @entity118			1
she gets excited as she talks of heading home to @entity120 : ‘ we go out on christmas eve to a local bar with my aunties and uncles and mum			0
our friends have a band and they perform , so i ’ll get up and sing @entity128 with them			0
it ’s just as much fun as singing with @entity118			0
’ @entity2 performs at the @entity25 , @entity26 , on december 9			0
