by @entity0 prince @entity1 made a grovelling apology and @entity4 mp @entity3 attracted public vilification			2
but shadow chancellor @entity6 yesterday offered no hint of shame for wearing a @entity10 uniform while at university , brushing it off as ‘ a laugh ’			1
in an interview likely to be seen as deeply insensitive , mr @entity6 said he was ‘ not embarrassed ’ by the photo unearthed by the @entity19 four years ago , saying the costume was handed to him as a prank by fellow students at @entity17			1
shameless : @entity6 , on the left , wearing @entity10 uniform			1
mr @entity6 said he was ' not embarrassed ' by the photo taken at a @entity25 dinner while he was a student at @entity17 in 1987 and brushed it off as ' a laugh ' he was speaking ahead of the keynote speech by leader @entity30 at the @entity32 conference in @entity33 , in which he is set to tell delegates how his parents fled @entity10 persecution			1
‘ of course i ’m not embarrassed by it ’ , mr @entity6 told the @entity38 website			1
‘ if i had the choice again , would i do it ? no. is there a difference between being 20 and being 40 ? yes			2
' i went along with it for a laugh			2
in retrospect i would n’t do it again			2
’ he told an interviewer the uniform was handed to him by ‘ the left caucus ’ at @entity52 , @entity17 at the end - of - term @entity25 dinner in 1987			1
then known as @entity55 , the future cabinet minister , was then president of the @entity57 , the college ’s elected student body and had during that term vetoed student calls for a rent freeze - in favour of an unpopular 2.5 per cent rise			2
not an ' alpha male ' : mr @entity6 insisted he shares cooking and shopping at home with his wife @entity68 , the shadow home secretary mr @entity6 had , shortly before the photo emerged in 2008 , called for pupils from every school in @entity72 to visit @entity10 death camps in @entity74 - and when @entity75 criticised the scheme as a gimmick , described it as a ‘ disgraceful remark ’			1
he was more bashful about the incident when questioned last year when he told a magazine : ‘ at the @entity25 dinner , the members decided that the committee should be required to wear costumes			1
' @entity86 was chosen by them			0
they decided i was a dictator			0
‘ when you ’re 20 , and it ’s the @entity25 dinner , do you make a stand as a matter of principle , or do you go along with it ? i went along with it			1
everyone has their regrets , i ’m sure			0
’ in a wide - ranging interview , mr @entity6 was asked what he would like to be written on his tombstone , to which he replied : ‘ i think i probably could n’t give a flying toss			1
he went on : ‘ there is something fabulous and noble and tragic about people whose reputations are finally rehabilitated and discovered thirty , forty or fifty years later			0
' in some cases , that can almost be the most selfless thing			0
those people are not the kind of people who worry about what ’s on their tombstone			0
’ asked about what he might do if his political career ended , he said he was full of admiration for doctors , and had thought about following his father - an eminent professor of cell biology - into medicine , but said he had ‘ sight of blood issues ’			0
if choosing again , he said he would be a head teacher			0
asked about his image as a ‘ bruiser ’ or ‘ attack dog ’ , he was said to become irritated , saying : ‘ if i was 5 ’ 5 ” and 11 stone they would n’t call me a bruiser			0
’ he added that he did not consider himself an ‘ alpha male ’ , saying he did the cooking and shopping in the home he shares with his wife , shadow home secretary @entity68 and their three children			0
