' wriggling ' : miliband as @entity1 parliamentary candidate for @entity2 in 2005 @entity3 has finally admitted that @entity5 ’s account of his @entity7 - type blunders when he lived with the family of a former @entity1 mayor is true			1
in a speech in @entity12 last week , the @entity1 leader tried to make light of his habit of getting into scrapes			1
but his attempt to play down his ‘ @entity18 ’ image stalled as he made a series of eccentric and contentious remarks , including : @entity3 ’s comments broke his silence after this newspaper ’s serialisation of an explosive new book by @entity26 , the former mayor of @entity2			1
@entity26 claims @entity3 ’s ‘ clueless and arrogant ’ behaviour while he lived with his family in the run - up to the 2005 general election made him lose faith in him			1
@entity3 and his advisers initially dismissed the revelations as ‘ ancient history ’ – but it did n’t stop @entity36 , @entity37 and others taunting him			1
it led to the @entity1 leader responding on thursday in a speech to more than 200 people , including many of @entity43 ’s leading political journalists , at the @entity44			0
he devoted a large chunk of his speech to this newspaper and @entity26 , admitted the reports were true , and even said he found the accounts of his bumbling behaviour ‘ hilarious ’			1
however , some members of the audience were mystified by @entity3 ’s attempt to laugh off the book ’s extraordinary disclosures – such as the incident when he nearly killed himself when he accidentally set fire to @entity26 ’s office and , inexplicably , bought the family a £ 25 @entity61 prayer mat for @entity62 to cover the hole burnt in the carpet			1
‘ they [ the @entity66 ] revealed how i gave @entity26 a @entity61 prayer mat to cover up a singed carpet , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i just thought it was what we in the jewish community call a nice piece of schmutter			2
’ there was laughter when he continued facetiously : ‘ they [ @entity66 ] got me banged to rights because this atheist @entity79 confesses tonight to being a secret muslim			1
that was during my @entity82 arsonist phase			1
’ but there were raised eyebrows when he compared his prayer mat gift to the attempt in 2011 by right - wing @entity88 tycoon @entity87 to smear @entity90 by suggesting he was a @entity61 and not born in @entity88			1
that incident caused outrage among @entity90 ’s supporters			2
@entity3 mused : ‘ i was wondering , where have i heard that before about a political leader ? i think @entity87 is available to go in search of my birth certificate and prove where i was really born			2
’ @entity26 ( pictured left with @entity99 centre ) , said mr @entity3 told local councillor @entity101 ( far right ) ' @entity103 carp you 've got there ' , after looking at pictures of her fishing trophies @entity3 confirmed @entity26 ’s account , reported by @entity5 , of how he nearly missed a meeting with @entity110 when he locked himself into his own house			1
he recalled : ‘ eventually – and this is true – i escaped through a window and therefore made history as the first person to make a break for freedom to get closer to @entity110			1
’ he tried to ridicule one of @entity26 ’s most damaging revelations , that @entity3 told him in october 2007 – a year before the @entity43 financial crash – that the @entity43 economy was about to ‘ fall off a cliff ’ , and that @entity1 had wanted to call an early election to cling to power before voters found out			1
‘ i am apparently @entity127 , ’ said the @entity1 leader sarcastically			0
mr @entity26 said last night : ‘ mr @entity3 ( pictured ) can sneer all he likes			1
he can not deny saying he knew the economy was about to fall off a cliff because he said it in my house			0
' ‘ i kept the global financial crisis from everyone and revealed it to only one person – not the head of the @entity135 , the @entity136 , or the governor of the @entity138 , but someone at the epicentre of global finance – the mayor of @entity2			1
’ mr @entity26 said last night : ‘ mr @entity3 can sneer all he likes			1
he can not deny saying he knew the economy was about to fall off a cliff because he said it in my house			0
‘ in mocking a local political ally he mocks all his supporters and his own town			0
’ linking an emotional passage about his grandfather who died in a @entity151 labour camp to the media ’s role in the coming election , mr @entity3 said ‘ some tough stuff ’ had been written about him in recent weeks			1
he added that ‘ truth - telling ’ was part of the job of the press – as had been ‘ very ably demonstrated by @entity5 ’			1
the killing of the @entity161 cartoonists by @entity163 terrorists in @entity164 underlined the need for a free press , he said			2
but he went on to argue that he and other politicians should be taken more seriously by the media			0
journalists should ‘ report on what [ politicians ] believe ’ and not encourage ‘ cynicism ’ by suggesting they had ‘ base motives ’			2
@entity174 and @entity175 alike were ‘ custodians of politics and its reputation ’			0
one observer said : ‘ it was entertaining , moving and cringe - making all at the same time			0
‘ he wriggled about knowing the economy was falling off a cliff in 2007			0
he seemed to say “ poke fun at politicians – but not me ”			2
@entity26 has got under his skin			0
’ @entity3 was presented with a light - hearted list of his top ten calamities when he lived with @entity26			1
the ‘ @entity192 ’ – as the @entity26 family called it – were inspired by the @entity189 ’s own description of incidents which occurred when he first became mp for @entity2 in 2005			1
they include : in his book , @entity195 , mr @entity26 tells how he and his family got a unique insight into @entity3 when he secured his selection as a @entity1 candidate			1
‘ we gave him the list of “ @entity192 ” because he got involved in so many catastrophes when he lived here , ’ @entity26 says			2
‘ it was like having @entity206 as a lodger			0
it was meant in good fun and @entity3 joined in the laughter			0
’ the ' @entity211 ' : 1			0
‘ things like that always happen around me			0
’ @entity26 says : ‘ @entity3 candidly admitted he had a reputation for getting into awkward spots – usually of his own making			1
‘ no … i ca n’t smell burning			0
’ winter : ‘ this was inspired by the way we found him in a semi comatose state in the office in my garden , having set fire to the carpet			2
for a moment we thought he might be dead			0
‘ @entity229 , @entity229 , get down ! oo it bit me ! ’ winter : ‘ when @entity237 visited retiring @entity2 mp @entity238 to ask for his support , @entity233 ’s @entity232 , @entity234 – @entity229 as we called it – attacked him			1
it ripped his jacket and he had to wave his arm around to shake it off			0
‘ @entity103 carp you ’ve got there , @entity245			0
’ winter : ‘ @entity237 asked local @entity1 councillor @entity101 , a keen angler who had lots of photos of her with carp on the wall , to back him			0
i said , “ what on earth did you say to her ? ” he said this			0
‘ hi guys – am i @entity260 or @entity261 ? ’ winter : ‘ he did n’t like @entity260 at all and took the mickey out of him by doing an impression – “ hi guys , who am i ? ” – and when you said “ @entity260 , ” he would say , “ no , it ’s @entity261 ”			2
’ @entity3 mocked @entity260 ( right ) in an impersonation that made him sound like @entity271 ( left ) 6			2
‘ i do have cultural reference points , you know			0
’ winter : ‘ we tried to help him connect to ordinary people by getting him to have a flutter on the @entity278 or have the occasional pint , but he did n’t get it , and does n’t have interests or knowledge outside politics			2
‘ @entity284 ? a joke politician			0
’ winter : ‘ i have always rated @entity284 as someone who understands working - class people , but whenever his name was mentioned , @entity237 would scoff , “ he ’s just a joke politician ”			2
‘ help ! i ’m locked in my house and i ’m meeting @entity110 in 20 minutes ! ’ winter : ‘ @entity237 had to be rescued by my partner because he could n’t unlock his own front door when @entity110 visited			2
‘ has she really got 19 cats ? ’ winter : ‘ @entity237 had just been to visit a local @entity1 supporter and it was the first thing he said to me when he came back			0
it had us in stitches			0
‘ did he just call me @entity302 ? ’ winter : ‘ we initially gave @entity3 the code name @entity302 to conceal the fact that i was backing him as mayor – but @entity3 blurted it out by mistake when we were in the pub. ’ the @entity310 also chose two songs for a farewell party for @entity3 – the @entity314 ’s @entity313 , with the lyrics ‘ @entity316 ’ , and @entity317 by @entity318			1
winter : ‘ he was always telling us what a smooth operator he was – sadly he was too busy for the party to take place			0
he was in such a hurry to leave that he left some possessions behind			0

@entity3 has finally admitted the @entity66 account of his blunders is true
in a speech last night , he tried to make light of habit of getting into scrapes
but his attempts to play it down stalled as he made more calamities
it follows the @entity66 serialisation of an explosive new book by @entity26
@entity3 and his advisers initially dismissed revelations as ' ancient history '
comparing his gift of a @entity61 prayer mat to *replace* a carpet burnt in an office fire he started by accident to a *notorious* attempt to smear @entity90 as a ‘ @entity61 ’ .
calling the prayer mat ‘ a piece of schmutter ’ – *yiddish* for ‘ cloth ’ .
jokingly referring to himself as ‘ an @entity82 arsonist ’ and ‘ secret muslim ’ .
mockingly implying that the former mayor of @entity2 – where @entity3 is an mp – is a *nonentity* .
defending the right of a free press to *lampoon* politicians – while hinting they should n’t do it to him .
mr @entity26 ’s book , @entity195 , goes on sale in april from @entity374 and other stores , £ 20 . @entity376 : *978* - 1 - 78148 - *451* - 7 .
