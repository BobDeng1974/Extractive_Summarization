to their horror , they found a huge @entity47 python coiled around @entity9 ’s head , neck and body			1
mrs link , a @entity26 expatriate , desperately punched the snake repeatedly , but to no avail			2
then her husband handed her his pocket knife			1
mrs link , who runs a care service for animals called @entity59 , said : ‘ @entity9 was starting to weaken and he eventually stopped struggling altogether			0
at that point we really thought we had lost him			0
so when i suddenly saw the snake 's head , i just started stabbing furiously			2
’ dedicated : mrs @entity7 runs an animal care service weapon : mrs @entity7 used a pocket knife similar to this to fend off the snake , which was coiled around her dog 's head , neck and body this had the desired effect and the reptile slithered away			1
@entity9 , who weighs around three and a half stone , was left in a state of shock and suffered deep bite wounds , but has now made a full recovery and is back to his energetic self , according to mrs link			0
luckily for @entity9 , his owner had recently completed an animal first aid course and put her skills to use in the immediate aftermath of the attack			2
she told @entity85 : ' @entity9 is incredibly special to us as i found him as a stray puppy very sick , emaciated and close to death			0
' he is also my first dog , a life long dream to have a canine companion			2

adult @entity47 pythons usually grow to around 15 feet in length , with the biggest ever recorded , in @entity109 , being 18 feet			1
they favour rats and mice , but will take pigs and goats – and even alligators			0
researchers , meanwhile , have discovered something new about @entity47 pythons - the snakes are really good at finding their way home			2
size matters : @entity124 staff next to the longest @entity47 python ever recorded - which measured 18 feet , eight inches researchers caught six pythons in @entity109 's @entity128 , implanted radio transmitters under their skins and released them up to two dozen miles from where they were captured			1
surprisingly , the snakes found their way home within months			0
according to research being published in the journal @entity137 , the pythons slithered with a purpose instead of moving randomly across the wetlands			0
it 's unclear how the snakes mapped their routes			0
the discovery about pythons ' unusual navigational abilities does n't immediately help @entity109 's wildlife agencies trying to curb the python population in @entity109 wetlands			2
the tan , splotchy snakes are notoriously hard to spot in the @entity150 even when tracked with transmitters .			0
