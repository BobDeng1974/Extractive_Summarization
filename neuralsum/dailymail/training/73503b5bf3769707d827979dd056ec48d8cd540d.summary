by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 01:54 est , 19 september 2012 doctors have carried out the world ’s first womb transplants between a mother and daughter			1
within the past few days , two women have received organs donated by their mothers in the hope they will be able to have children			1
the recipients , whose names have not yet been revealed , are aged between 32 and 37 , and are from @entity13			0
scroll down to watch the video the team from the @entity16 performed the transplant operation on two consecutive days the operations each lasted seven hours and were carried out at the weekend by a team of ten surgeons from the @entity16			0
one of the women had been born without a womb while the other had recently had the organ removed following surgery for cervical cancer			1
both were still able to release eggs from their ovaries and underwent ivf before the operation to produce embryos			1
these have been frozen and doctors intend to implant them into the women ’s new wombs next year in the hope they will become pregnant			1
the women were ‘ tired ’ following the surgery but were recovering well , the @entity13 doctors said			1
when the uterus is taken from the donor , an incision is made in the lower abdomen			1
the operation consists of removing the complete uterus from the surrounding tissue			2
after the uterus has been detached from the donor it is placed on a bed of ice and blood vessels to the uterus are flushed with preservation solution			2
from the time the organ has been lifted in to the receiver it takes between 20 and 40 minutes before the new blood vessels begin to function			2
when the blood circulation is working effectively the uterus is connected to the patient 's vaginal top and fixed in the pelvis ( above )			1
however , the team will not hail the operations a ‘ complete success ’ until the women have given birth to healthy babies			2
even though the mothers are in their 50s and 60s , the doctors believe they will be healthy enough to bear children			0
and the women ’s bodies are less likely to reject wombs from their own mothers because the tissue is very similar to their own			1
over the next few months the doctors will gradually give the women fewer ‘ immunosuppressant ’ drugs , which stop their immune systems rejecting the organs , in the hope they will begin functioning normally			1
professor @entity87 , an expert in obstetrics and gynaecology at the @entity16 who led the team of surgeons , said : ‘ this is a major step forward			0
‘ the women are well , they are walking but are tired after surgery			2
the donating mothers are up and walking and will be discharged from the hospital within a few days			0
’ the woman whose womb had been removed following cervical cancer , identified only as @entity102 , said she had been ‘ handed a fantastic opportunity ’			2
writing on the @entity16 ’s website she said : ‘ i have been very careful to make my mother feel that she does not have to do what she is doing			0
my mother , however , is totally focused upon my welfare			0
’ she and her boyfriend had created ten embryos , she added			0
over the coming months the surgeons plan to carry out similar transplants on another eight women			0
they include seven who will receive wombs from their mothers and one who is being donated the organ by her older sister			0
they are unable to have children unless they use a surrogate mother , which is illegal in @entity13 – although it is allowed in @entity125			0
last year @entity127 doctors announced they had carried out the world ’s first womb transplant , in which 22 - year - old @entity130 was given the organ of a woman who had died in a car crash			1
she was due to begin @entity136 treatment this month in the hope of conceiving a child in her new womb			1
but these latest operations are the first time doctors have carried out transplants between mothers and daughters			0
last night @entity125 fertility experts said that although the procedure was a significant breakthrough , it could only offer hope to a handful of infertile women , including those born without wombs or those who have had them removed due to cancer or gynaecological conditions			1
dr @entity156 , a leading consultant in infertility and gynaecology , said : ‘ this is a potential advance for a small group of women but i am cautious about how widespread the implications will be			0
’ now watch the video			0

two women in their thirties received their mother 's uterus
they will need to wait for one year before *undergoing* @entity136
if procedure works it will be the first time a mother and daughter will have grown in the same womb
women stop producing eggs around the age of 50 but their wombs can remain *viable* past 60
