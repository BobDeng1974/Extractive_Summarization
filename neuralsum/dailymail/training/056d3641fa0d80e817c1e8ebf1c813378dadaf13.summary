by @entity0 the @entity1 is searching for a new spy chief after it was announced sir @entity3 , the head of @entity4 , is stepping down			1
the boss of @entity7 's overseas intelligence services – traditionally known as ‘ c ’ – will leave the post in november after five years			2
sir @entity3 – often compared to @entity11 for his suave manner and good looks – had tried to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding @entity4 and was its first head to give a public speech			1
sir @entity3 was the first @entity4 chief to be chosen from outside the service for 41 years but his departure comes after a rocky year in which the three @entity7 intelligence services – the others are @entity23 and @entity24 – were thrown into disarray by @entity29 whistleblower @entity28 's revelations about surveillance			1
only one – @entity32 , the director general of the domestic spy agency – will be left			0
officials said sir @entity3 ’s departure was not linked to the @entity28 disclosures			1
sir @entity3 was the first @entity4 chief to be chosen from outside the service for 41 years			1
his appointment was opposed by senior spies who believed it was an attempt by the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) to increase its influence after the @entity43 debacle , when the intelligence agencies claimed @entity43 had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction			0
sir @entity3 's departure , after five years service , was not linked to the disclosures made by @entity28 sir @entity3 , 58 , is a career diplomat who has also worked as an envoy in @entity50 and as foreign affairs adviser to former prime minister @entity52			1
but he was no stranger to the world of espionage , having trained with @entity4 at the start of his career before joining the @entity1			1
last year he told an intelligence committee hearing the @entity28 revelations had been very damaging			1
‘ they have put our operations at risk			0
it is clear our adversaries are rubbing their hands with glee			0
@entity67 is lapping it up , ’ he said			0
sir @entity3 was accidentally exposed by his wife , @entity69 , on the internet shortly after being appointed to the top job , and in one picture he could be seen on a beach in tight - fitting swimming trunks in 2012 , @entity4 was also in the spotlight when a coroner criticised spies for hampering the police investigation into the death of @entity81 , a @entity24 employee seconded to the agency who was found dead in a holdall in a @entity86 flat			2
even though he presided over a secret service , sir @entity3 was accidentally exposed by his wife , @entity69 , on the internet shortly after being appointed to the top job			2
to the astonishment of spy - watchers , personal photographs posted on @entity92 showing the spy chief on a beach in tight - fitting swimming trunks			0
other potentially compromising details about where the family live and work , who their friends are and where they spend their holidays were posted			0
the names of serving members of @entity4 other than its head are secret , so a speculative list of potential successors will not be made public			2
but one candidate could be @entity108 , director of the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) , a close ally of home secretary @entity111 .			0
