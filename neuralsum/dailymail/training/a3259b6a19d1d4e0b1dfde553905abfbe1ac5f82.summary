with the @entity2 warning sugar could be ‘ the new tobacco ’ because of its risks to health through obesity , you might think a diet that cuts it out would get the thumbs up from experts			1
but a group of scientists has just consigned a trendy sugar - free anti-ageing plan to a list of fad diets it dismisses as a waste of time and money , and potentially dangerous			1
while dieters can forgo sugar in yoghurt , ready meals , dessert and biscuits , for example , having none at all is almost impossible			1
‘ fruits , vegetables , dairy products and dairy replacements , eggs , alcohol and nuts all contain sugar , which would leave you with little other than meat and fats to eat – definitely not very healthy			2
’ the sugar - free diet was one of five assessed by dieticians , biochemists and other experts for the charity @entity54			1
they also dismissed the caveman diet , said to be favoured by actor @entity57 , which holds that because we evolved eating a limited number of foods , we should return to our evolutionary roots and eat berries , vegetables and lean meat , while eschewing modern fare such as cereals , lentils , beans and dairy products			1
but archaeologist @entity71 said : ‘ while it is true that fluffy white loaves of sandwich bread wo n’t have been known to our hunter - gatherer ancestors , if you are worried about a healthy diet , have lentil soup , but skip the @entity81 bar			2
’ also rejected were diets that claim to selectively slim parts of the body by influencing hormones			0

basics : dieticians , biochemists and other experts also dismissed the caveman diet , said to be favoured by actor @entity57 ( pictured ) , which says we should eat berries , vegetables and lean meat however , biochemist @entity100 said : ‘ there is no evidence linking hormone synchronisation and weight loss			2
’ meal - replacement drinks were also found wanting			0
@entity106 , a biomolecular scientist , said we need variety , not least to avoid ‘ losing your enjoyment of food ’ and becoming depressed			0
' cutting all sugar from your diet would be very difficult to achieve ' @entity35 , biochemist the bizarre clay diet was also considered a health risk			1
its followers believe a spoon of clay a day detoxifies the body , boosts the immune system and balances acidity levels			0
however , dieticians warn it can cause problems from constipation to poisoning and say ‘ detoxing ’ is a marketing myth			0
@entity54 , which has created an online quiz on the issue called @entity131 , says : ‘ people actually introduce malnutrition through overly restrictive diets … and they lose heart following unsustainable diets			0
’ @entity137 , of the @entity138 , said : ‘ fad diet promoters never let sound nutrition get in the way of persuasive marketing to promote their myths and generate profit			0
