while the construction industry has traditionally been thought of as a ' man 's world ' , two women have launched a range of female workwear to encourage young girls to feel confident considering a future in the workforce			1
@entity8 and apprentice @entity9 launched their @entity12 - based company eve renovations in 2010 out of a passion to shake up the construction industry - where only 1 % are women - with a solely female workforce			1
' @entity17 has been a builder in the industry for 15 years , and she can say without a doubt that the change in that time has been marginal			0
for us nothing changed because , really , nothing has changed , ' @entity9 told @entity25			2
@entity8 ( left ) and apprentice @entity9 ( right ) launched their own clothing range in the 25 years between 1987 and 2012 , the proportion of women represented in the industry has remained the same , a statistic which both worried and motivated the pair to go a step further with their business			1
the women launched eve workwear , a range of clothing suitable for women in the industry that was made specifically for them to work in , while still looking good			1
' our company does domestic and commercial renovations and we obviously wanted to look good when we went to clients houses for quotes , ' @entity9 said			1
' i come from a marketing background and meetings were big deal , you wanted to look the part , so i could n't understand why it was acceptable to turn up in daggy clothes that did n't fit , ' she said			0
' women 's workwear was just men 's workwear with a different label on it			2
they did n't fit right , were too big , and were in horrible colours			0
' so @entity17 and @entity9 decided to do something about their situation and have workwear specifically made for them , and after having praise heaped upon their designs , made up their minds to extend the trend to other women			1
the range is suitable for women in the industry and is made specifically for them to work in , while looking good the self - funded workwear range launched in 2011 , releasing small - scale ranges which have now expanded after two long years of hard work the range bridges the gap between workwear and streetwear the self - funded workwear range launched in 2011 , releasing small - scale ranges which have now expanded after two long years of hard work			1
the range bridges the gap between workwear and streetwear , offering shirts , pants , jackets , singlets and hi - vis necessities that fit well and are still practical			1
' in any job that a woman decides to do , dressing and feeling confident and proud of what you 're doing is so important , ' said @entity9			2
' a lot of study goes into being a carpenter or electrician and women should be proud of that , ' she said			0
@entity9 said that having clothing that fits well and is specifically designed for women also adds a sense of belonging in a male - dominated industry			1
' we 've had some great responses and stories from women doing all different things , from truck - drivers to make - up artists , ' she said			2
' we 're hoping that with our renovations and clothing company that we get noticed for what we 're doing and make the industry more of an option for girls			1
' the range offers shirts , pants , jackets , singlets and hi - vis necessities that fit well and are still practical @entity9 said that having clothing that fits well and is specifically designed for women also adds a sense of belonging in a male - dominated industry ' there are so many great options - women can design furniture , or do something technical like become an electrician			1
there are so many different areas that women may find they 're suited to , it 's not all heavy lifting			0
' both @entity17 and @entity9 have male mentors are very positive about the way they have been treated in the industry , and say that men are a lot more accepting of women on site			1
however @entity9 said that she wants to encourage more women to actually get on the site in the first place , which she believes starts in high schools			2
' both @entity17 and i have stayed with the tools rather than moving into management or administration roles , because we are trying to show girls in high school that trades are an option , ' she said			0
' we are trying to create change , and if you do n't take risks then nothing will change			0
' @entity9 's favourite item from the eve workwear range is the brand new workpants @entity9 said that the company also wants to encourage men and women to look at jobs they are interested in @entity9 's favourite item from the eve workwear range is the brand new work pants			1
' they are so versatile , and have stretch in the fabric which makes them super easy to wear			0
we describe them as chuck them on the floor and chuck them back on			0
they can just be worn and worn , ' she said			0
' they were inspired by vintage workwear which comes through in the buckle on the back , and the big pockets which crosses them into streetwear and makes it feminine			2
' @entity9 said that the company also wants to encourage both men and women to look at jobs they are interested in , rather than along gender line			1
' take gender out of the equation			0
some guys are good at make - up and some girls are good at being electricians , ' she said			0
' it should n't matter if you 're male or female			0
it should be about the role you want to pursue			0
