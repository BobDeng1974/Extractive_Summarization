forget wireless or portable phone chargers , a pair of engineering students have created a device that could charge a phone ’s battery using @entity7			1
the device uses so - called metamaterials that can capture energy waves and convert them into an electric current			1
the amount of voltage the device creates is also said to be more powerful than that produced through current usb chargers			1
students from @entity18 have created a device , pictured , that converts microwaves into an electric current			1
having successfully tested their energy harvester , the researchers claim it could be modified , and one day , fitted to phones to charge batteries using @entity7 signals metamaterials are engineering structures capable of harvesting various forms of wave energy			1
by arranging certain materials , including copper and fibreglass but also gold , in a particular shape and pattern , the properties of those materials can combine to become an almost ‘ super ’ material			0
@entity18 's @entity40 explained : ‘ imagine a fabric woven of thread			0
in this fabric , light is only allowed to flow over the threads			0
‘ if you punch a hole in the fabric with a pin , light will go around the hole and resume its original course of travel , since light can only travel over the thread			0
‘ he continued that because light waves can only travel in this way , the hole is practically ‘ invisible ’			2
metamaterial arrays work in the same way to control how waves move around the structure , making it possible to capture and harvest them , and their energy			1
it was created by @entity67 and @entity68 from @entity18 's @entity69 with help from professor of electrical and computer engineering , @entity73			1
the team used five fibreglass and copper energy conductors wired together on a circuit board to create what 's called a metamaterial array			2

by arranging certain materials , including copper and fibreglass but also gold , in a particular shape and pattern , this array can control how waves behave @entity67 and @entity68 ’s device was designed to harvest the energy from microwaves			1
they claim their five - cell metamaterial can convert these waves into 7.3 volts with an efficiency of 36.8 per cent			2
by comparison , usb chargers for phones and other small devices provide around 5 volts			1

by comparison , usb chargers , pictured , provide around 5 volts having successfully tested their energy harvester with microwaves , the researchers claim it could be used to harvest the signal from other sources such as satellite signals , sound waves or @entity7 signals			1
‘ it ’s possible to use this design for a lot of different frequencies and types of energy , including vibration and sound energy harvesting ’ said @entity68			0
‘ until now , a lot of work with metamaterials has been theoretical			0
we are showing that with a little work , these materials can be useful for consumer applications			0
’ @entity68 continued that a metamaterial coating could also be applied to the ceiling of a room and used to redirect lost or dropped @entity7 signals			1
the researchers added that a similar device could one day be fitted to phones and other small electronic devices			1
this could make it possible to charge phones by connecting it to a @entity7 , without the need for a charger or power point			1
‘ our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting , ’ said @entity73			0
‘ the beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self - contained and additive			0
one can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power			0

engineering students have created a device that captures wave signals
the energy from these waves are then converted to an electric current
students claim the voltage produced is *higher* than in usb chargers
the invention could one day be used to charge phones using @entity7 signals
