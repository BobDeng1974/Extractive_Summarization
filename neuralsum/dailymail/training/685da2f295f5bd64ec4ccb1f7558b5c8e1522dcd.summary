by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:20 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:21 est , 23 december 2013 while today ’s stargazers eagerly anticipate comets , ancient cultures often branded them as ‘ harbingers of doom ’			2
now a @entity9 study suggests that people living 1,500 years ago may have had good reason for fearing these celestial objects			2
scientists claim they can link @entity15 ’s comet to a devastating famine that occurred in 536 ad			1
scientists claim they can link the famous @entity15 's comet to a devastating famine that occurred 536 ad the comet , they say , caused a change in climate when it threw up enough dust into the atmosphere to cause the planet to cool significantly			1
this led to a period of widespread drought , crop failures and famine			1
scientists believe the event made humanity more susceptible to ‘ @entity35 's plague ’ in 541 - 542 ad , which is the first recorded appearance of the @entity37 in @entity38			1
according to an analysis of @entity43 ice that was laid down between 533 and 540 ad , large amounts of atmospheric dust fell on @entity44 at this time			1
the comet caused a change in climate when it hit			2
this , scientists believe , made humanity more susceptible to ' @entity35 's plague ' in 541 - 542 ad , which is the first recorded appearance of the @entity37 in @entity38 @entity15 returns to @entity44 's vicinity approximately every 75 years , so some people could see it twice in their lifetime			1
the last time it was here was in 1986 , and it is projected to return in 2061			0
the comet is named after @entity58 astronomer @entity57 , who examined reports of a comet approaching @entity44 in 1531 , 1607 and 1682			0
@entity15 's most famous appearance occurred shortly before the 1066 invasion of @entity58 by @entity63			1
it is said that @entity63 felt the comet heralded his success			0
the comet was put on the @entity68 as a result			0
‘ i have all this extra-terrestrial stuff in my ice core , ’ study leader @entity70 , of @entity72 's @entity71 told @entity73			2
researchers believe the dust came from the @entity79 meteor shower which is created by leftovers of @entity15 's comet			1
this may have caused a period of mild cooling in @entity85 , but it can not explain the global dimming event of 536 - 537 , during which the planet may have cooled by as much as @entity88 ( 5.4 degrees @entity89 )			1
professor @entity90 claims that one explanation is that something large hit the ocean			0
she claims to have found circumstantial evidence to support this theory			0
the @entity43 ice cores , she said , contain fossils of tiny tropical marine organisms			0
an extra-terrestrial impact , such as from @entity15 ’s comet , could have blasted these low - latitude organisms to @entity43			1
in august , researchers at @entity104 said that a cosmic impact 12,900 years ago could have led to the demise of the ‘ @entity109 ’ people of @entity108			0
a layer of platinum from an ice core taken in @entity43 was dated back to the time of a known abrupt climate transition , known as the ' @entity115 '			0
according to researchers at @entity104 , this provides evidence that a comet tipped the world into its colder phase , making dozens of species extinct			0
according to an analysis of @entity43 ice that was laid down between 533 and 540 ad , large amounts of atmospheric dust fell on @entity44 from space at this time			2

@entity15 threw up dust into atmosphere causing planet to cool in 536 ad
*temperature* dropped by as much as 3 *°* c leading to drought and famine
scientists claim this made humanity more susceptible to @entity35 's plague
the plague was the first recorded appearance of the @entity37 in @entity38
