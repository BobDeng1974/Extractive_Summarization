want to boost your bust in time for your summer break but ca n't afford to splash out on surgery ? @entity5 organic brand , @entity6 , claims to have the solution			1
its latest launch is @entity10 and @entity11 , £ 27 , which is said to add up to 4cm ( the equivalent of two cup sizes ) to your breasts after just six weeks of use			1
the elixir 's breast - boosting ability is said to be the result of mukul extract ; a resin extracted from the bark of the @entity24 tree			1
enhancing : @entity25 say that their @entity26 can add two to four centimetres to the breasts within six weeks groundbreaking : @entity6 's @entity10 and @entity11 , £ 27 according to @entity25 , the natural extract has been clinically proven to have a 're - pulping ' or plumping effect on breast tissue and also helps to fill in wrinkles by increasing lipid ( fat ) storage			1
' the oleoresin active in @entity10 helps with skin tonicity by increasing lipid storage on the breast , ' said a spokesperson for the company			0
' it has been clinically proven to re-pulp existing lipid cells so helps the breasts become fuller depending on the level of existing lipid cells after six weeks of use			2
' in terms of augmentation i would say no. it can only work with what we have naturally and [ is ] not like synthetic breast implants that create larger breasts			0
' we have also developed a lime and orange essential oil blend which helps with increasing circulation and is uplifting aromatherapy , all in a natural light oil base to be used for massaging the area and to help with skin moisture levels			0
' the resin has a long history of use , although more commonly as a perfume ingredient			2
called @entity68 in the @entity69 , it is similar to myrrh and was a key part of the merchandise on the caravans that travelled the @entity73			0
along with its use in perfume , mukul extract has long played a part in ayurvedic medicine , in particular as a treatment for obesity			1
but despite being an effective anti-obesity aid , not everyone is convinced by its claims to increase the size of the breasts			0
dr. @entity87 of the @entity88 of @entity89 said : ' these creams are an intensive moisturising system , but as for boosting breast size or plumpness , i do n't believe this will have any effect			1
' surgery is the only option if you want firmer or larger breasts , and it can now be done in a number of ways from a very natural effect fat transfer ( using fat taken from elsewhere in the body ) to breast implants			0
' though these creams have good intent , i do not believe ingredients such as extracts or oils would do much in the way of plumping breast as creams only penetrate the top layer of skin , though they will , i 'm sure , add moisture to the skin			2
