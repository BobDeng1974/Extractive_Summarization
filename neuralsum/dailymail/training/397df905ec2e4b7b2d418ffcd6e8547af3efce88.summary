no sooner had @entity0 left @entity2 fans gobsmacked with his decision to bow out after 16 years at @entity4 than the race has begun to find someone with the right credentials to adequately replace him			1
' this show does n't deserve an even slightly restless host and neither do you , ' he told his audience on tuesday night			2
he said he might depart in july , september or maybe december			0
@entity0 's passion , wit and boldness make for a magical combination that will be difficult to re-create when he steps away later this year			2
it 's significant , ' said @entity34 , a @entity35 professor and author of @entity37 ? : mockery and @entity39			0
the @entity2 averages just slightly more than 1 million viewers a night - a far smaller audience than his late - night competition on the big networks - but during his time as host @entity0 has became disproportionately influential in @entity48 politics and culture			1
under @entity0 , the show has won 18 emmys , taking home the award for @entity54 every year from 2003 to 2012			2
it also won two @entity56 , for its election coverage in 2000 and 2004			0
in a 2004 poll by the @entity60 , 21 percent of respondents aged 18 to 29 cited @entity2 as a regular source of political news			0
the @entity2 boot camp has graduated a number of impressive talents who might prove to be worthy of the host chair , @entity34 said , counting @entity26 first among a group including @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
there are outsiders who certainly have the comedic chops			0
but do they have the star power and the backbone to speak punchlines to power , and on a nightly basis ? possible successors : @entity81 is already @entity2 's ' senior youth ' correspondent , while @entity83 is an established comedian known for his outspoken views on modern @entity48 @entity2 regulars @entity70 and @entity71 are other names that have been thrown in the hat as the search begins to replace @entity0 looking over the possibilities , here are some candidates to consider : @entity93 alumnae @entity92 and @entity94 have been mentioned as possible replacements for @entity0 other names in the frame for @entity2 include @entity98 and @entity99			1

@entity0 *announced* on tuesday that after 16 years he will step down from @entity4 's @entity2 later in the year
@entity102 is now on to find someone worthy of filling the *enormous* hole he is leaving behind
early favorite is @entity27 comedian @entity26 who stood in for @entity0 in 2013 , but left soon after to host a similar show at @entity29
list of potential replacements also includes @entity92 , @entity83 , @entity22 and even **disgraced** @entity111 anchor @entity24
@entity26 : he 's top of the list for a reason : he proved he could emerge from the @entity2 ranks and succeed as host when @entity0 took a movie - making break . @entity26 and his *dimples* *defected* to @entity29 , but his return home would be *triumphant* .
@entity92 or @entity94 : *paired* for *efficiency* 's sake given their *frequent* *collaborations* . like @entity0 and @entity26 , they *'ve* got the *likability* that helps make hard - hitting *satire* *palatable* **—** and how about at least one woman in late - night tv ?
@entity22 : there is a **growing** argument that late - night television is long overdue a female host . the *vacancy* at @entity2 could be an ideal *opportunity* for @entity22 , whose @entity4 series **premiere** in 2013 was the network *’s* most - watched **premiere** that year .
@entity141 : a **growing** star at @entity4 where he already hosts the *social* media - *oriented* show @ *midnight* . the comedian also has a regular **gig** fronting *walking* dead spin - off @entity147 . could be a *strong* contender because of his youthful fan base .
@entity83 : *brilliantly* *funny* , certainly *fearless* . he *wrote* an essay about being black in an *entertainment* *industry* that is ' kind of racist ' in its *hiring* practices **—** although he said he was n't being political at all , adding , ' that 's @entity0 , that 's ( @entity157 ) @entity156 . '
@entity159 : he 's a writer , *performer* and *singer* who can summon the *juvenile* glee , if not the artfulness , that @entity0 *employs* to leaven the angst . and he could bring a *sidekick* , his *devilish* movie creation @entity167 the teddy bear .
@entity98 : an experienced all - *rounder* with talent to spare . she *co-hosts* the talk , has acted in series including @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and *friends* and also hosts @entity179 is it anyway ?
@entity81 : a @entity2 player whose titles include ' senior youth ' and ' senior @entity185 ' correspondent , she 's *brimming* with *energy* and edgy charm . whether she has the experience and heft to step into the center ring is an open *question* .
@entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 : experienced @entity2 regulars but when @entity0 took a break during the @entity196 to direct his movie @entity198 , it was their *colleague* @entity26 who was *trusted* in the big chair .
@entity99 : the soup host already balances his @entity204 *sitcom* role with a host **gig** , so why not step it up ? he 's quick witted , *lovable* and has a following that encompasses the frat - *boy* demo that is *undeniably* part of the @entity2 fan base .
@entity24 : the **disgraced** @entity211 host has *technically* been sacked but is starting a six month *suspension* . @entity24 may use his extended break to *reconsider* where his *career* is going and is n't it his desire to be considered more than just a news anchor that got him into *trouble* in the first place ? could be just the reinvention he needs .
