@entity7 and her husband were snapped for more than three hours as they hung by ropes on the mountain side and dangled in the air			1
the couple explained that they ’re both devoted fans of outdoors sports and that they ’d also considered trying other extreme sports before finally settling on climbing , which they both like the most			0
brave : the couple are both fans of outdoor sports - but love rock climbing the most all the wedding gear was transported to the location and the pair changed on the spot all the wedding gear was transported to the climbing location and the couple got dressed on the spot for the shoot			2
the photographer , @entity55 , caught in these pictures taking the snaps suspended from a rope , said : ‘ i do like rock climbing but not quite at the level of this pair			0
it was a bit nerve - racking being suspended by ropes and i 've never really done such a difficult one before , but the pictures really worked out well			0
‘ i am just glad they did n't go for a full family group , it was bad enough with two of them without trying to fit another dozen people in and getting them to smile at the same time			0
’ he added that at the end of the day it had been good fun and if another rock - climbing pair wanted the same treatment he 'd be happy to oblige			0
