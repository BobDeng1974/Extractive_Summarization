@entity0 netted @entity2 's opener against @entity3 but the £ 30million star 's overall performance on wednesday night highlighted the @entity7 ' urgent need for an out - and - out striker			1
in the absence of @entity10 , @entity0 was used as the @entity7 go to man upfront but looked isolated and unable to create the magic @entity2 fans will have been hoping to see when the @entity12 arrived at the @entity13 this summer			2
a world - class attacker who gave everything on wednesday , yes , but deploying £ 30million @entity0 as a lone frontman is a waste of his supreme talents			2
on target : @entity0 fires @entity2 ahead in the @entity7 ' @entity21 play - off against @entity3 pointing the way : @entity0 is congratulated by @entity24 after scoring his first competitive @entity2 goal struggles : @entity0 gave an impressive performance but the @entity12 is n't suited to playing the lone frontman @entity28 showed fighting spirit - @entity29 this @entity21 qualifier reaffirmed @entity2 's need for a targetman - someone to goal - hang , to finish the many chances a five - man @entity2 midfield will create			1
the @entity7 worked hard and fully - deserved their 1 - 0 victory but lacked that cutting edge in the final third - @entity0 performed well and won many of his duels against defenders but is n't entirely suited to playing upfront on his own			1
with the scores at 0 - 0 , @entity0 continued to run deeper and deeper in a bid to get on the ball and influence the game leaving @entity2 bereft of anybody to assist upfront			1
as the touch map below shows , much of @entity0 's play came from outside of the area			1
rolling in the deep : @entity0 's touch map shows how deep the @entity2 frontman came for possession @entity58 shares a similar trait - when his side is in desperate need of a goal , the @entity57 frontman will also drop deep in an attempt to change the match			1
both players make things happen and have the skills to do so			0
of course , @entity0 's strike came as the 25 - year - old was sprinting into the box rather than standing and waiting inside it as @entity2 's tactics suggest			1
the men playing behind @entity0 - @entity24 , @entity74 and @entity76 - can thread forward passes all night long but it has little effect with no frontline to run onto the ball or hold it up			0
everywhere : @entity0 spent large parts of the match outside of the area in an attempt to make things happen pulling the strings : @entity74 and @entity24 needed to get beyond @entity0 in @entity10 's absence the midfield trio must run beyond @entity0 if @entity2 are to have any luck in front of goal but that is n't happening so far this season - the @entity7 look restricted and almost come to a standstill in the final third with every player seemingly keen to assist rather than be set up themselves			1
as well as balls through the middle , much of the play from @entity2 's widemen is also wasted without a towering presence in the area			2
new right back @entity103 - who was to be sent off late on - whipped in an inviting cross on twenty minutes but the ball was easily cleared by the @entity107 visitors as @entity2 lacked anybody in the area who could adequately challenge in the air			0
nobody to ruffle the feathers of the @entity3 backline			0
looking forward : @entity0 plays a forward ball past @entity3 midfielder @entity115 on wednesday night this was highlighted in the @entity7 ' 2 - 2 draw with @entity118 on saturday			2
@entity0 was completely ineffective at @entity119 , admittedly a tough place to play your first away game in the @entity122			0
the former @entity124 man was replaced having struggled up against the powerful defensive pairing of @entity126 and @entity127			0
however , as soon as @entity0 was replaced by @entity10 , @entity118 looked stretched and @entity126 and @entity127 looked anxious almost as the striker caused them problems in the air - something @entity0 was unable to do			2
as it was , @entity10 was the man to latch on to @entity134 's cross from the left to equalise in the dying stages and salvage a point for the @entity7			0
rescue point : substitute @entity10 scores a last - gasp equaliser for @entity2 against @entity118 unfortunately , @entity2 will have to do without the @entity141 international for a considerable amount of time after @entity10 suffered an ankle injury			0
many fans of the north @entity147 club were adamant the club needed another striker even with a fit @entity10 - now with the no 12 set for a spell on the sidelines , @entity29 will surely have to act in the final days of the transfer window			0
if @entity29 fails to do so , the £ 30million talent of @entity0 will be completely reigned in if forced to play as @entity2 's lone frontman			1
@entity0 can score goals as well as create but would be far better playing behind the striker rather than the furthest man forward himself .			0

@entity0 scored the only goal in @entity2 's 1 - 0 win over @entity3 to fire his team into the @entity21
the £ 30million summer *signing* is @entity2 's can play anywhere across the front line
despite @entity2 's win and @entity0 's goal however , the game against @entity3 highlighted @entity29 's need to sign another striker
@entity10 is injured and ruled out until *january*
