astonishing : one in ten trainee teachers have failed their final - year numeracy and literacy tests twice in a row , while dozens have needed ten attempts ( picture posed by model ) critics said yesterday those who take multiple resits should not be teaching and will have a detrimental impact on their pupils			1
from next year , education secretary @entity24 is limiting the number of retakes to just two			1
trainees have to pass basic skills tests in literacy , numeracy and @entity31 ( information and communication technology ) before they qualify for the classroom			2

under mr @entity24 ’s plans , woefully poor trainees will no longer be allowed in the classroom			1

but critics say his crackdown does not go far enough			1
passing the numeracy test has been a requirement of @entity81 since 2000			0

‘ the nature of tests is that ... people will be able to fluke them , which means they pass but have no proper understanding of the subject – much like with driving tests			0
three attempts will reduce this possibility , but it does not go far enough			0
