@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has joked that the intense strengthening programme he was put on in his early days at the club left him feeling like ' @entity4 '			1
@entity5 underwent a brutal regime after joining @entity1 as a skinny 20 - year - old and he was in the gym three mornings per week at 9.30am and also had extra afternoons sessions twice a week			1
' i was like @entity4 in one year ( laughs ) ! ' the keeper said in an interview with the club website			2
it is more of a reduced programme now but certainly i did a lot of gym work at the start and it did have a big impact			0
' @entity5 has been in outstanding form this season and he also believes that his improving level of @entity35 has contributed to his performances			1
the @entity37 did study the language at school but struggled to communicate with fluency early on at @entity1			1
he is now in a position where he is able to conduct interviews in @entity35			2
' i actually think the biggest impact is when you are in the dressing room			0
you need it on the field as well , of course , but you need it in the dressing room			0
the @entity37 has transformed into one of @entity1 's most important players this season the 24 - year - old was the man of the match against @entity56 in early december after making some fine saves @entity5 doing some strength work during training ( left ) and getting stuck in against @entity60 ' i think the fact that i have started to do interviews in @entity35 has really helped as well , it has helped me to learn more of the language as well			1
' @entity5 , whose @entity1 contract expires in 18 months ' time , has thwarted opponents across the country in the first half of this campaign but he has warned that the best is still to come			1
he added : ' no matter how excellent your form is , you can always get better and there are always aspects of your game that you can improve			0
' you can improve everything			0
no matter how well people think you are playing , or how well you think you are playing yourself , it is always a case of working on every facet of your game			0
there is hopefully more to come			0
