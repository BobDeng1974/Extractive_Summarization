by @entity0 published : 02:05 est , 26 january 2014 updated : 02:05 est , 26 january 2014 employees at an @entity5 , @entity4 camera equipment store have created a comical version of security footage of a somewhat inept thief breaking into their store			1
last saturday at 1:28am , the thief stole several items from @entity13			2
the hilarious video shows surveillance footage of the robbery , set to the @entity18 theme song played by chorus of kazoos			1
breaking in : the thief finally breaks through the shop 's glass door before fumbling with the green screen mad dash : he runs into the store wielding a sledgehammer the thief can be seen incompetently trying to break through the store 's glass doors			0
finally entering the store after outwitting a green screen , the thief , wielding a sledgehammer , smashes display cabinets and other items in his artless attempt at thievery			0
with each item the robber steals , a graphic appears over the security footage detailing the piece of equipment and its worth			1
among the loot is a $ 60 mixer , a $ 299 boom microphone and a $ 400 camera			0
loot : the inept thief gets his hands on a $ 60 mixer smashed glass : the thief caused a lot of damage but stole just a few relatively worthless items from the store the bumbling burglar darts around the store , at one point dropping an expensive piece of equipment only to grab a significantly cheaper item in its stead			2
the video was posted on @entity68 with the description : ' our store got broken into			0
judging from the surveillance video the thief does n't seem to be highly skilled in his area			0
' the second half of the video , which features the burglar trying to leave the store , is set to @entity80 's @entity79 - with kazoos , of course			1
the robber kicks his way out of the store , losing his mask as he goes , dropping all the things he stole and falling over onto the prone green screen			0
blind robber : the owners of the store , which carries very expensive film and audio equipment , ca n't believe they were n't robbed blind in the incident trouble : the thief slips over on his old nemesis the green screen as he tries to take the stolen goods out of the store getaway car : he finally leaves the scene in what looks like a rather expensive vehicle ( seen out of the shop windows ) he finally leaves @entity13 with a total of $ 1,358 worth of stolen goods , from a store that carries cameras worth upwards of $ 10,000 and a set of lenses worth $ 46,000			1
employees of @entity13 note that the thief speeds away from the scene in what appears to be a $ 40,000 @entity115 getaway car			1
the video was posted saturday and already has more than 35,000 views			2
the thief clearly did n't anticipate , despite robbing a store that deals in cameras and film equipment , that employees turn their misfortune into a cinematic triumph cum viral internet hit			2
according to @entity126 , the clumsy thief has not yet been apprehended .			0
