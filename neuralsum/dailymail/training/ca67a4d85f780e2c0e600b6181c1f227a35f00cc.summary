a convoy of vehicles carrying ' dummy ' obese women could be used to help smuggle @entity5 's mother out of prison , it emerged today			2
@entity5 , who has ballooned to 22st in a @entity9 jail , was this week granted parole despite allowing her boyfriend and his paedophile brother to torture to death her son @entity11			1
after five years behind bars , prison and probation bosses are likely to use subterfuge to stop the 32 - year - old being photographed , traced and attacked by vigilantes when she leaves ' within days '			1
@entity24 has gained at least a stone for every year she has been in jail , having previously admitted ' i put on a lot of weight when i came to prison ' by gorging on pizza and jam tarts in solitary confinement			2
freedom : @entity5 , 32 , left , is set to leave prison this week and having put on weight decoy women of a similar build could be used to sneak her out			1
she was jailed in 2009 over the death of her son @entity11 , right sources have said a plan is in place to hide @entity24 inside a car within the prison walls before being swept to a secret location to start a new life			1
meanwhile extra vehicles containing women of a similar weight with their faces covered could also be used to throw anyone keen to follow her off the scent			2
the same ploy was used when the girlfriend of @entity58 murderer @entity56 left prison			1
in 2004 , when @entity60 left @entity59 in @entity61 , she was stowed in the footwell of a car at the same time as several similar vehicles also left			0
' it will be difficult to get her out without being seen , but there are ways and means , ' a @entity66 source told the @entity71			0
' she may not be freed straight away , but when she is , they will use tactics to ensure she is not photographed , just as they did with @entity56			2
' let out : @entity24 has left @entity75 jail ( pictured ) in @entity76 , @entity77 and was released after five years there for allowing her son 's death @entity24 will also be given detailed advice on how to hide who she is when she leaves jail in the coming days to avoid being found			2
ploy : @entity56 was smuggled out of jail in the footwell of a car in 2004 when she left prison she will leave @entity75 jail near @entity77 for a parole hostel to start her reintegration back into society			1
she is already said to look markedly different from her notorious mugshot , having put on weight while in prison			0
but probation officers will also advise her to change her name by deed poll , change the colour of her hair and have it cut differently			0
a @entity103 spokesperson said : ' the release of life and other indeterminate sentence prisoners is directed by the independent @entity107 once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community			0
' the @entity111 licence lasts for a minimum of 10 years , and an offender on an @entity111 licence may be recalled to prison at any time for breaching their licence conditions			0
additionally , they will be subject to strict controls and restrictions for as long as their risk requires them			0
' after just five years in jail experts believe she poses ‘ no danger to the public ’ , despite committing a crime that horrified @entity129			0
@entity24 was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend @entity5 and his paedophile brother @entity134			1
@entity11 was just 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood - spattered cot at his mother ’s flat in @entity137 , north @entity138 , after suffering 50 separate injuries , including a broken back			1
the case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers , police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child ’s life			0
indefinite sentences : @entity5 's boyfriend @entity5 ( left ) and his paedophile brother @entity134 ( right ) were both convicted of causing or allowing @entity11 's death sickened by the depravity , 132,000 people joined ‘ hate groups ’ on social networking internet sites calling for @entity24 , @entity155 and @entity134 to ‘ burn in hell ’			1
some threatened to violently attack them when they are eventually released			0
despite widespread horror at her imminent release , ministers have decided she should not be granted lifetime anonymity and round - the - clock police protection			2
anonymity orders are rare and only four are currently in force			0
these apply to child killer @entity170 , @entity173 ’s murderers @entity171 and @entity173 and to @entity56 , who provided a false alibi for @entity58 murderer @entity176 .			1

@entity5 , 32 , of @entity178 , north @entity138 , jailed indefinitely in 2009
