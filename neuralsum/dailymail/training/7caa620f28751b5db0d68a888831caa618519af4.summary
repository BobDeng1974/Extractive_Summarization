published : 07:33 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 08:10 est , 25 january 2013 @entity1 engineers have fired up a 40 - year - old rocket engine they hope could help send man beyond the moon			1
the engine , known to @entity1 engineers as @entity7 , was supposed to help propel @entity8 into orbit in 1969 , when @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 went to the moon for the first time			1
however , while the mission was a success , the engine was grounded because of a glitch during a test in @entity20			1
during moon missions , five of them were arranged at the base of the 363 - foot - tall @entity34 system and fired together to power the rocket off the ground toward @entity38 orbit			1
a single f - 1 engine can produce 1.5 million pounds of thrust using a fuel composed of liquid oxygen and refined kerosene , which was not used in the space shuttle it was later sent to the @entity46 , where it sat for years , and now engineers are learning to work with technical systems and propellants not used since before the start of the space shuttle program , which first launched in 1981			1
@entity53 , 27 , and other engineers at @entity1 's @entity23 ran a series of 11 test - firings of the @entity58 's gas generator , a jet - like rocket which produces 30,000 pounds of thrust and was used as a starter for the engine			1
they are trying to see whether a second - generation version of the @entity66 engine could produce even more thrust and be operated with a throttle for deep - space exploration			1
there are no plans to send the old engine into space , but it could become a template for a new generation of motors incorporating parts of its design			2
in @entity1 - speak , the old 18 - foot - tall motor is called an f - 1 engine			1
during moon missions , five of them were arranged at the base of the 363 - foot - tall @entity34 system and fired together to power the rocket off the ground toward @entity38 orbit			1
thursday 's test used one part of the engine , the gas generator , which powers the machinery to pump propellant into the main rocket chamber			2
it does n't produce the massive orange flame or clouds of smoke like that of a whole @entity104 , but the sound was deafening as engineers fired the mechanism in an outdoor test stand on a cool , sunny afternoon			0
the device produced a plume that resembled a blow torch the size of two buses and set fire to a grassy area , which was quickly extinguished			0
' it 's not small , ' @entity53 said			0
' it 's pretty beefy on its own			0
' and just like during the @entity66 days , people in north @entity121 heard rockets thundering in the distance during tests at @entity125			0
the engine being tested was built for the 1969 mission , when @entity1 sent @entity10 and two other astronauts to the moon for the first time ' my wife and daughter were in our front yard and she said they could hear it , which was pretty cool , ' @entity53 said after an earlier test			2
' we live about 15 miles away			0
' a single f - 1 engine can produce 1.5 million pounds of thrust using a fuel composed of liquid oxygen and refined kerosene , which was not used in the space shuttle			2
the tests were conducted at @entity125 in a project conducted with @entity148 and @entity149 , which are studying @entity1 's possibilities for deep - space missions years from now			2
the space agency plans to use commercial launches to reach low @entity38 orbit ; larger rockets are required to escape the planet 's gravity			2
@entity158 , an engineer who works with case in @entity125 's liquid propulsion office , said young engineers can learn a lot from the work done by predecessors using slide - rules in the 1960s , but no one wants to simply rebuild the old @entity34 engine			2
@entity8 just after takeoff : now experts say its rocket motor could be updated for future missions ' this would n't be your daddy 's f - 1 , ' @entity158 said			1
' we 'd use new materials and try to simplify it , update it			0
' case started at @entity125 as a high school intern in 2002 and has been working there since graduating from the @entity184 in @entity185 in 2008			0
he said today 's technology allows things that were n't possible during the 1960s , but he has been impressed by what he learned taking apart the unused @entity8 engine			1
engine @entity7 did n't fit properly on the @entity8 rocket , but it is invaluable now as a testing tool			1
@entity158 said a total of 85 f - 1 engines were used on 17 @entity66 flights without a single failure			0
about a dozen f - 1 engines remain in @entity185 , @entity121 , home of @entity1 's main propulsion center , and others are located elsewhere			0
case said engineers used engine @entity7 for the tests because it was the most complete			0
' it is really an excellent booster , ' he said			0
' the guys in @entity66 had it right			0

f - 6049 engine was supposed to help propel @entity8 into orbit in 1969 - *buy* was grounded because of a glitch
*researchers* now hope to study it to see if it can be updated for future missions
