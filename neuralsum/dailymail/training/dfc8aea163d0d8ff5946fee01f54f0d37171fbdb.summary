high flyer : the @entity1 of @entity2 will be transported in style @entity5 chiefs were yesterday accused of living the ‘ high life ’ at taxpayers ’ expense after signing a £ 10million deal for the use of private jets to fly them around the world			1
@entity1 , the @entity5 ’s foreign policy chief , is among the eurocrats who will enjoy use of the jets for their globetrotting			1
from tomorrow , the @entity20 peer will be able to use a choice of aircraft – including the @entity24 jet and @entity25 – when she travels abroad for @entity5 business			1
@entity28 , president of the @entity30 , and @entity31 , president of the @entity32 , are among other dignitaries who will benefit from the agreement with @entity36 firm @entity35			1
the news of the deal – estimated to be worth as much as £ 10.3million over the next four years – comes after @entity39 reacted with fury to the @entity5 ’s demands to increase its budget by seven per cent			1
the @entity30 ’s proposal would increase the @entity45 budget by 6.8 per cent to nearly £ 114billion			1
@entity39 ’s share , at around 12.5 per cent , would be £ 16.6billion – a rise of more than £ 1billion			2
@entity1 has demanded an extra £ 23million to run the @entity5 ’s foreign service – despite her promise that it would be ‘ budget neutral ’ when she was appointed as its foreign minister in 2009			1
her 5.7 per cent increase takes the annual bill for @entity5 diplomats and embassies to £ 422million , at a cost to @entity39 taxpayers of £ 52million in @entity5 contributions			2
speaking of the private - jet deal , @entity63 , a senior @entity64 , said : ‘ coming just days after @entity30 leaders put forward a preposterous set of budget proposals , claiming they were doing all they could to save money , this confirms they really have no shame			2
no expense spared : the @entity24 private jet deal cost £ 10m ‘ they have lost their moral and financial compass and they are prepared to ensure they get to live the high life , whatever the expense and whatever other people ’s hardship			2
‘ they seem to live in their own little bubble where they are perpetually pampered			2
’ the @entity30 insisted the deal would , in the long term , save money			0
it argued that the £ 10.3million sum was essentially a retainer payment and was the maximum that would be spent during the next four years			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the contract that comes into effect on tuesday will run for up to four years			0
it sets a total ceiling of 12million euros over the four years			0
this is therefore the maximum possible expenditure for all @entity5 institutions ... we do n’t pay anything when we do not use this service			0
’ details of expenditure by @entity99 commissioners has revealed that £ 6.6million has already been spent on the hire of private jets in the four years to 2010			0
last october , @entity1 , the vice-president of the @entity5 , came under fire after she headed off on a trip to a five - star hotel in @entity105			1
as @entity99 leaders struggled to save the euro , she flew to @entity108 where she attended a three - day @entity110 heads of government meeting			0
critics said the entire trip was a waste of time and totally irrelevant to her job			0
