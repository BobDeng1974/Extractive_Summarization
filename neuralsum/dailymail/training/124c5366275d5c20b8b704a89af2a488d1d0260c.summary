by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 insists he has no doubts over @entity6 ’s continued commitment to the club despite wrecking the central defender ’s dream of a deadline - day move to the @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
@entity2 left @entity6 out of the starting xi for their 1 - 1 draw with @entity16 at @entity17 after telling the @entity18 he would be going nowhere despite interest from @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
‘ he had of course wishes to get to a new stage , ’ said @entity2 , who remains positive about landing @entity24 striker @entity23 despite fears of a last - minute hitch			1
‘ he is a young player and a young man - and he will get many chances in his career			1
but now we need we need him here and he knows that and that is how it is going to be			1
disappointment : @entity6 was incredibly disappointed not to seal a move to the @entity11 ‘ i think it ’s no problem			1
but he needs a couple of days to get this out of his system , get thinking positive again			1
‘ he ’s a player we want to have and we would like to sign him on an even longer contract			1
that ’s how it is			1
we need good players here and we need to have his kind of player if we want to get the results we need			1
so that is no problem , that is how it is			1
’ asked outright if he worried about the commitment of a player with declared designs on a move , @entity2 said : ‘ no. he is professional			1
there are a lot of emotions , a lot of thinking , and not so much sleep			1
the speculation is hard for the mind			1
it will be good when we come back after the break			2
‘ i am 100 per cent sure ( that he will be committed )			1
’ training : @entity67 is still training but missed the match against @entity16 as he was not in the right frame of mind invited to explain whether he or the player had decided on his omission from a team struggling defensively , the manager said : ‘ we talked about it			1
when you are not 100 per cent at @entity3 you ca n’t play			1
then other players can do a better job and that is how it is			2
‘ there has been a lot of speculation and a lot of thinking for him			2
he is a very important player for us , a very good player – and we have told him that there is no chance he is going to leave			2
‘ he is too important to us , so there is no chance we will let him go during this window			2
we could n’t replace him			2
so he is going to stay here			2
‘ of course it ’s hard for him and he ’s had a lot of thinking to do			2
but it will not be a problem			2
‘ his girlfriend is also pregnant and due soon			2
so he has n’t had the right focus , he would n’t have been 100 per cent today – that is why he did n’t play			0
’ reports in @entity100 insisted that @entity102 striker @entity23 , who has passed a medical after the clubs agreed a fee , was prepared to spend today waiting to see if a better offer came in from elsewhere			0
committed : @entity108 said he had no doubts as regarding @entity67 's commitment to the club but @entity2 declared : ‘ no that ’s not my understanding of it			1
he wants to play for @entity3			1
that ’s a good start			0
‘ we hope that that can be arranged			0
we are working hard now every day to get that done			0
‘ i think the process is ongoing			0
it ’s paperwork all over , things have to be settled 100 per cent before we can go out with anything			0
‘ will anyone else come in ? we ’ll see			0
we are working all the time to see what the options are			0
’ asked about persistent whispers of a bid for @entity129 midfielder @entity128 before the transfer window closes , @entity2 said : ‘ no.			0
. i ca n’t comment			0
’ @entity131 : @entity3 missed out on @entity133 qualification after losing to @entity134 he was more adamant about the prospect of @entity137 going on loan , saying : ‘ he is going to stay as well			1
no players are going out , it is important to get people fit and players back from injury , get the new players in and back from injury and get them playing matches so we have a strong and good squad for the fantastic games we are going to have after the next 14 days			0
’ @entity2 was disappointed that his team conceded after just a minute yesterday , saying : ‘ that was a very poor start – i think we looked afraid and we lacked energy			0
that lasted for quite a while			0
‘ i am not very concerned by the results			0
now we get ten days away from each other , because almost the entire squad is going away with their national teams			0
‘ it is a possibility for them to get their heads around something else , also play more matches			0
when they come back , we will know who is going to be here – and who is not going to be here			0
‘ we can start working with the squad we have , new players will come in and we will be more fit , as well			0
so we will be a stronger squad and stronger team after the international break			0
