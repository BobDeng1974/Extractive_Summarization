by @entity0 @entity2 manager @entity1 might have deemed @entity4 surplus to his requirements at the @entity6 in @entity2 , but the little playmaker showed up the decision with some sublime skill in @entity11 's first pre season outing			2
the @entity12 may have lost 2 - 1 to @entity13 in @entity14 as they warmed up for the new campaign but @entity4 was in the mood for showing off , producing some brilliant moves that will leave @entity19 defenders worried ahead of the start of the season			1
one or two moments left his markers helpless as the 22 - year - old showed all the benefits of a full summer off following his @entity6 exclusion			0
catch me if you can : @entity4 showed off his skills during the pre season friendly in @entity14 see ya later : @entity4 's skills had the @entity13 defenders in a twist during the 1 - 1 draw on one occasion he scooped the ball past a defender on the touchline before later effortlessly nutmegging another with skill that will have @entity11 fans purring			1
@entity4 will be hoping to replicate his late - season form as @entity11 's players aim to fill the void left by the departing @entity46 this season			0
taking control : @entity4 traps the ball under his foot on the touchline bring it : he draws in the defender to make the challenge while a team mate breaks down the wing class : his brilliant bit of skill leaves the marker flat - footed too easy : ... and leaves @entity11 with loads of space to attack down the wing potential : it is a big season for the @entity66 after he did well for @entity11 but failed to make @entity2 's squad video new @entity11 signing eyes @entity19 trophy			0

@entity1 left @entity4 out of his @entity6 squad
he missed out despite a great end to the season with @entity11
the @entity12 lost 2 - 1 to @entity13 but @entity4 showed *glimpses* of *talent*
he performed a brilliant *stylish* *chipped* pass down the line in @entity14
