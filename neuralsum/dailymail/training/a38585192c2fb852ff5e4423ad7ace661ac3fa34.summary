by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:45 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 05:08 est , 29 october 2012 recommendations : @entity3 is expected to make it harder for foreign companies to buy @entity7 firms @entity9 divisions over how the get the economy moving are expected to be exposed this week when @entity3 challenges the government to do more to bolster @entity7 ’s regions			1
the former deputy prime minister will publish a report proposing sweeping changes to the way local economies are run , drawing on his experience as a minister in @entity21 ’s government			1
the report on how to stimulate economic growth is expected to lead to a clash with the @entity25 on a range of issues			1
days after figures showed @entity7 had emerged from the longest double - dip recession for 50 years , mr @entity28 is under pressure to ensure faltering economic growth continues			1
@entity3 is expected to criticise the jumble of @entity35 schemes aimed at helping businesses weather the economic storm , and suggest giving local @entity38 more powers and public money			1
the @entity9 peer will also recommend cuts to red tape and some business taxes as well as a shake - up of local government			2
@entity3 ’s report will be delivered to mr @entity28 and business secretary @entity48 on wednesday , but panicked officials are already holding meetings on how to respond to it			1
he is expected to demand a public interest test to prevent foreign takeovers from damaging national interests , thousands of civil servants be moved out of @entity56 and the creation of new regional bodies in charge skills and training			2
the proposals are said to have caused ‘ discomfort in the @entity69 ’ with many of the ideas apparently advocating the recreation of @entity66 ’s vast and costly @entity65 which the coalition scrapped			1
the idea of setting up a new network of quangos would prove costly at a time when government is still under pressure to save billions of pounds			0
@entity3 , who has been given an office in the @entity77 , is understood to advocate greater state intervention in local economies , favoured by @entity80 , a @entity81 minister			1
one @entity83 source said : ' he is clear that the state can do more			1
not @entity66 - style state subsidy , but also not the laissez - faire approach that some in government would prefer			2
' mr @entity28 ’s aides insist he is relaxed about the report , and expects to welcome much of its contents			1
a @entity69 spokesman said : ' we are very much looking forward to receiving it			1
' @entity83 sources said that former deputy prime minister @entity3 is likely to propose a tightening of the rules following a string of controversial bids for @entity7 firms			1
the move is expected to be resisted by senior ministers , who believe a political test for policing foreign ownership runs the risk of becoming protectionist			0
@entity66 ’s 2002 @entity108 introduced major reforms of the regime – including a new competition test for assessing mergers and takeovers , to be used in most cases			2
this replaced a broader public interest test , which some are now arguing should be reintroduced			0
significantly , mr @entity48 was in favour of the idea in opposition			2
days before the 2010 election , he said : ' it should n’t be nationalistic			0
the issue is not whether there is a foreign bidder , it ’s about whether it ’s in the interests of the @entity7 economy			0
' the government removed this provision in 2002 and we ’re now seeing the damage done by opening up a complete free - for - all			0
' we need to protect firms from takeovers forced through by hedge funds for short - term profit that ’s not in the long - term interests of the @entity7 economy			0
' ' @entity139 law ' : a protester demonstrating outside the head office of @entity139 in @entity142 , in 2010 as the @entity7 confectioner said it had agreed to a £ 12bn takeover from @entity147 giant @entity146 the reforms were dubbed the ‘ @entity139 law ’ , after @entity146 ’s £ 12billion takeover of the @entity7 confectioner prompted a backlash from politicians and unions who argued it was too easy for foreign predators to snap up @entity7 companies			0
recently , there was controversy over a proposed merger between @entity7 defence giant @entity159 and @entity161 rival @entity160			0
the deal collapsed earlier this month but industry experts warn that @entity159 is vulnerable to a takeover approach			0
labour leader @entity165 has suggested changes are needed to defend the long - term interests of @entity7 business against ‘ fund managers chasing the fast buck ’			0
@entity3 will also demand major new powers and extra funding be handed to regional bodies , freed from control by ministers in @entity56			1
‘ @entity83 has local authorities by the short and curlies and you have got to break that monopoly , ’ he declared last year			2
he is likely to call for an end to the two - tier council system , where district and county councils divide responsibility for services			0
but @entity9 ministers have repeatedly criticised the idea of more unitary authorities running local areas			0
in may 2010 communities secretary @entity190 pulled the plug on unitary councils in @entity193 and @entity194 , branding them ‘ ludicrous ’ and an ‘ expensive distraction ’ .			0

@entity3 ’s ideas on how to stimulate economic growth may lead to a clash with the coalition
major report has caused ' discomfort in the @entity69 ' say @entity83 sources
business secretary @entity48 likely to back measures calling for more state intervention in regional economies
