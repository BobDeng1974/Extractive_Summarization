@entity0 was today accused of showing a ' callous ' lack of humanity for refusing to help drowning immigrants fleeing @entity4 on ramshackle boats			1
the prime minister has withdrawn support for rescue operations that save thousands of migrants crossing the @entity10 to @entity11 , amid fears traffickers use them as a ‘ taxi service ’			1
but the decision was attacked by @entity18 leader @entity17 today , who accused mr @entity0 of showing a lack of ' basic humanity ' during prime minister 's questions today			1
they do n’t show basic humanity and say rescuing drowning people is a pull factor for immigration			1
‘ but they are so incompetent they ca n’t deliver their basic promises			2
why does n’t he just admit it , on immigration , he has failed ? ’ but mr @entity0 rejected the accusation and accused @entity18 of leaving ' the biggest mess this country has ever seen ' when it came to immigration			0
people traffickers are allegedly setting off from @entity4 with satellite phones and calling the @entity49 coastguard to come and pick them up			1
the decision by ministers provoked outrage from refugee groups who said it would lead to more people ‘ needlessly and shamefully dying on @entity11 ’s doorstep ’			2
but @entity58 officials insist the huge rescue operation has led to more attempted crossings and put more lives at risk – as traffickers try the journey in less seaworthy crafts			1
several thousand people have died attempting to make the crossing in the past 12 months			1
of those who survived , many have headed north to @entity70 and tried to get in to @entity58			0
dangerous : migrants arriving at @entity72			1
in the past year around 150,000 people making the treacherous crossing from @entity4 , many in ramshackle boats , have been picked up by the @entity49 navy the @entity49 government is to stop search and rescue operations after thousands were picked up this year , including 600 would - be immigrants rescued from the @entity10 in a single weekend in september @entity49 launched its air and sea rescue operations last year in the wake of the @entity86 tragedy in which hundreds of migrants died when their boat caught fire			1
since then the @entity91 mission has seen @entity93 ships patrolling vast areas of the @entity10 and picking up migrant vessels			2
but it is due to end this week , and will be replaced on november 1 with a more limited border security operation , known as @entity98 , run by @entity101 border agency @entity99			0
this will patrol a much smaller area closer to @entity11 ’s southern border and will not actively search out migrants in difficulty			2
earlier this month foreign office minister @entity107 told the @entity108 : ' we do not support planned search and rescue operations in the @entity10			1
' we believe that they create an unintended ' pull factor ' , encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths			1
' the government believes the most effective way to prevent refugees and migrants attempting this dangerous crossing is to focus our attention on countries of origin and transit , as well as taking steps to fight the people - smugglers who wilfully put lives at risk by packing migrants into unseaworthy boats			1
' @entity132 chief executive @entity131 said : ' the @entity58 government seems oblivious to the fact that the world is in the grip of the greatest refugee crisis since the @entity138			0
' people fleeing atrocities will not stop coming if we stop throwing them life rings ; boarding a rickety boat in @entity144 will remain a seemingly rational decision if you 're running for your life and your country is in flames			0
' the only outcome of withdrawing help will be to witness more people needlessly and shamefully dying on @entity11 's doorstep			0
' the answer is n't to build the walls of @entity11 higher , it 's to provide more safe and legal channels for people to access protection			0
' the new operation , called @entity98 and run by the @entity101 's @entity99 borders agency , is due to commence on november 1 but has a ' very different ' objective from @entity91			0
@entity99 spokeswoman @entity162 told the @entity164 4 today programme : ' our operation covers a very specific operational area and we only have a few vessels and a few aircraft			2
the @entity10 is over 2.5 million square kilometres large - it is virtually impossible to have a full overview of what is happening at sea			0
a picture from the @entity175 in february shows a boat with @entity178 migrants on board spotted by the @entity93 at sea near @entity86 , @entity49 ' our operation is exclusively that of border control			1
@entity91 is an operation that aims at search and rescue , so these two operations are very different			2
' @entity185 , secretary - general of the @entity186 on refugees , told today that the @entity101 should fundamentally change its approach to the problem , allowing more people to enter legally			0
he said : ' one of the reasons these people are making the journey is because the policy of the @entity101 is that there are almost no safe and legal means to access @entity199 soil to file an asylum claim , for example			0
there is only resettlement , and resettlement numbers are quite low , but that is the only legal way			0
' so individuals who are stranded in @entity4 , who are fleeing for their lives , who are running from persecution , from war , who have no choice because their homes have been bombed and destroyed , their family members have been killed , they have been raped and tortured and gone through horrendous journeys along the way , the only way that they can attempt to come to @entity11 is through organised criminals			0
' if @entity11 allowed a safe and legal way for people to come , they could use the money that they are paying to criminals and they could buy first - class aeroplane tickets to @entity11			0

@entity49 rescue ships have rescued tens of thousands of immigrants
*100,000* have reached @entity49 this year and some *2,000* have died trying
ministers warn rescue operations create an unintended ' pull factor '
risk encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing
@entity17 today slammed ' callous ' policy which lacks ' basic humanity '
