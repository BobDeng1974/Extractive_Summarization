by @entity0 and @entity1 as @entity4 waits to find out if he has a future in football , rival players in @entity3 are continuing to mock his alleged bite on the shoulder of an @entity10 defender			1
even @entity11 , the @entity10 involved in the clash with @entity4 , poked fun at the incident which happened as @entity15 knocked his team out of the @entity18			1
the grinning @entity20 centre - back posted a picture of a hotel maid biting his shoulder , in much the same way as @entity4 appeared to on tuesday night			1
elsewhere , @entity3 striker @entity26 was snapped pretending to bite teammate @entity28 's arm in training , and @entity31 comedian @entity30 turned up at a @entity33 bar where @entity35 fans were gathered and promised then he would bite ' every @entity37 player ' if @entity35 's next game is a close call			2
humour : @entity11 is bitten on the shoulder by a hotel maid as he sees the funny side copycat : @entity26 pretends to bite @entity3 team - mate @entity28 's arm in training ' @entity35 ! @entity35 ! ' : @entity31 comedian @entity30 last night told a bar packed with @entity35 fans that he would ' bite every @entity37 player ' if the crunch clash between the two teams is a close call left - wing magazine the @entity52 , meanwhile , calculated that top - flight footballers are more likely to be bitten by @entity4 than by a shark			1
using rough calculations , the magazine 's @entity56 blogger @entity55 found that players have about a one in 2,000 chance of the @entity62 ace trying to take a chunk out of them , while there is only a one in 3.7million chance of being bitten by a shark in the ocean			0
@entity4 's clash with @entity11 prompted a huge spike in @entity72 mentions of the @entity15 wonder boy			1
the social messaging site told @entity74 that prior to the bite , there about 100,000 mentions relating to @ @entity77 on tuesday			2
after the incident there was a massive two million mentions of @entity4 by 10pm tuesday night			1
@entity72 's data showed how most of the mentions occured in @entity82 and the @entity35 , the biggest @entity72 - using regions , followed by @entity4 's own regional neighbourhood of southern @entity85			2
the also football - mad region of @entity87 also showed massive interest , as would be expected , but there were also notable spikes in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
@entity72 also revealed that the most retweeted @entity4 tweet showed him wearing a collar of the kind given to pets by vets to stop them chewing at their own wounds , which was shared more than 21,000 times			0
tweets by the comedian @entity104 mocking the player and @entity107 picks reporting how one man cashed in by correctly betting @entity4 would bite someone during the tournament were also widely shared			1
but while his footballing peers and fans of the beautiful game can see the funny side , @entity4 is no doubt anxious as @entity116 's disciplinary hearing over the issue reconvenes in @entity118 this morning			1
he is also facing the loss of lucrative sponsorship deals			0
the official statements from his sponsors were anodyne , but @entity123 has reported rumours that the striker could be jettisoned			0
@entity4 is sponsored by adidas and executives from the sportswear manufacturer met in @entity118 last night to discuss the latest incident			2
an adidas spokesman said : ‘ adidas is aware of the issue involving @entity4			2
we await @entity116 ’s full investigation into this matter and will respond accordingly			0
’ gambling company 888poker have @entity4 as a brand ambassador and said : ‘ following recent allegations made against @entity4 , we are reviewing our relationship with him			1
we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour			0
’ @entity15 @entity142 president @entity141 emerged from the @entity144 hotel in @entity118 shortly after midnight local time to say the hearing would continue on thursday			0
@entity141 said : ' we know they met for a long time but we do n't know if that means a good or a bad situation			0
they will continue in the morning			0
' @entity4 's lawyer @entity152 , who is also a @entity15 @entity142 board member travelled to @entity118 to defend the @entity62 striker and claimed there is a @entity156 campaign against him led by @entity157 and @entity158			1
an outcome is expected well ahead of @entity15 's match with @entity158 on saturday and @entity4 's sponsors are keeping a close eye on the verdict			1
step 1 : @entity4 approaches @entity11 from behind during a @entity15 attack stage 2 : the @entity62 striker moves his head close to @entity11 's shoulder as he prepares to attack stage 3 : @entity4 appears to clamp his jaws down and bite @entity11 's shoulder the video evidence appears damning and one senior @entity116 official with experience of disciplinary cases , who asked to remain anonymous , believes the biting should be judged to be at least as serious as spitting , which carries a minimum six - game ban which would see @entity4 's @entity18 brought to an abrupt halt			1
however there are influential voices who are trying to bring pressure to bear for the player to be dealt with more leniently			0
according to @entity15 newspaper @entity188 , the most powerful figures in @entity187 gathered in the @entity144 to try to secure a much less severe sanction			0
shocking : @entity11 displays bite marks on his shoulder after the incident , but the referee was n't swayed these included @entity203 's long - standing vice-president @entity202 who is second only to @entity204 in the pecking order , the president of @entity199 @entity198 and his predecessor , @entity200 , who are both @entity201			2
the independent disciplinary panel , chaired by @entity208 lawyer @entity207 , has a range of sanctions available up to 24 - match ban or a two - year suspension from all football			0
a worldwide ban would impact on his playing for @entity62 but there is no precedent for such a sanction happening			0
trouble ahead : @entity116 will continue to discuss disciplinary proceedings against @entity4 on thursday it remains unclear whether @entity4 's previous biting bans - 10 games for biting @entity223 's @entity222 and seven matches for biting @entity226 's @entity225 - would be taken into consideration , but the panel do have that power if they wish			1
a @entity116 spokeswoman said : ' they can take in all elements they deem necessary			0
' @entity4 has not appeared in person at the disciplinary hearing			2
there are also reports that the @entity15 @entity142 are claiming pictures of teeth - marks on @entity11 's shoulder were digitally altered .			1
