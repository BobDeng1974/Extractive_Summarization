by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 6 august 2013 an elderly couple endured a seven year ' nightmare ' when a council broke its own planning laws and filled a @entity5 next door to their house with homeless people			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , were kept awake by the sounds of shouting , swearing , loud music and fighting emanating from the @entity14 , and they said police were frequently called out to disturbances at the property			1
the @entity19 , who likened their ordeal to ' living in a war zone ' , say @entity22 ignored their complaints for years before finally launching an investigation and apologising to the pensioners			1
' unacceptable ' : @entity9 and @entity10 , pictured with their friend @entity26 , a former @entity28 , described their seven year ordeal as like ' living next to a war zone ' the problem had escalated to the point where the @entity33 were too scared to leave their home for fear of it being damaged or burgled , and missed out on spending christmases with their children and grandchildren to stay in the house			1
moving would have meant selling their three - bedroom semi detached home in @entity11 for a fraction of the £ 300,000 it is worth			0
in 2002 the council ’s own planners and a planning inspector ruled that only four rooms could be let at the @entity5			1
tormented : the couple grew too afraid to leave their house due to the ' barrage of inappropriate behaviour ' at the @entity5 next door but three years later the authority signed an agreement to place up to nine homeless people there , taking some from other councils ' areas			1
the @entity33 are now seeking compensation from the authority after an independent investigation found they had suffered a ' wholly unacceptable level of hostility , aggression and disturbance '			2
police were called to the b&b on average three times a month said retired van driver @entity9 , 71 , and his wife @entity72 , a 69 - year - old retired laboratory assistance			1
they made hundreds of complaints but it was five years before the authority launched a full investigation			1
mrs @entity10 , who suffers from stress as a result of the case , said : ' we saved up for our own home but we were prevented from enjoying it			1
' we could n’t sit in our garden or we would be subjected to a barrage of swearing and inappropriate behaviour			0
' it was like living in a war zone sometimes , and someone even committed suicide there in 2011			0
' we were constantly on edge wondering who was going to move into the house next			2
there were nine strangers with various social problems - it was a recipe for trouble			0
' it was horrible when mothers and children were in there and all you could hear was shouting			2
' they chucked used tampons and condoms into our garden which we had to clean up ourselves			0
' we could not sit and have our evening meal in peace - and all you could hear was loud rap music , death threats and every other word was a swear word			0
' mrs @entity10 added : ' the council were flouting their own rules			1
' they used the property for their own purposes without consideration for what the neighbours had to put up with			0
' no - one should have to put up with what we did these last seven years , you should n’t have to live like that			2
' the council have a duty to the homeless but they should have thought it through properly			1
' they never checked with the planning department that what they were doing followed the rules			0
' mr @entity136 said : ' we were always on edge , never knowing what ’s going to happen			0
we could n’t lead a normal life in our own home			0
' ' the owner has made a lot of money at our expense			2
' his wife added : ' the council has said the problems started in 2007 , but we were making repeated complaints to the police and council from 2005			1
' we were never in it for the money , we just wanted a peaceful life			0
but now we think the council should pay for its cock ups			2
' we want the compensation to cover the full time we had to endure this nightmare			0
' no - one else should have to endure all that we did over the years			2
' apology : an investigation commissioned by @entity22 indicated the authority had made mistakes including failing to share information across its departments mr and mrs @entity10 say they started making complaints about anti-social behaviour at the @entity174 guesthouse back in 2005 , but the council maintains it only has records from 2007			1
eventually in 2010 the council recommended the hostel employ a night manager , but the @entity33 say they failed to keep the place under control			2
the landlord applied for ‘ lawful development ’ in 2012 to use more than four rooms , but planners turned it down			1
the council took no action until @entity11 mp @entity189 and former city councillor @entity26 pointed out that their own planning status restricted it to four tenants only			0
independent complaints investigator @entity193 said the @entity33 had endured a ' wholly unacceptable level of hostility , aggression and disturbance '			1
she added : ' i find it extraordinary that the council not only failed to uphold the decision of the planning inspectorate but encouraged use of the property in direct contravention of it			0
' she has recommended the council pays the substantial compensation to the couple			0
@entity210 , the council ’s environment director , said he had apologised to the couple			0
he said : ' the investigation that we commissioned shows we made mistakes , including failing to share relevant information between our own departments			1
' we recognise that was unacceptable			0
' the b&b which stands next to the @entity220 is now empty and a spokesman for the property owner claimed complaints had always been acted upon .			2

@entity9 and @entity10 disturbed by shouting and fighting at b&b
say they made hundreds of complaints to council over period of years
@entity22 planners ruled only four rooms could be let
3 years later it signed an agreement to house up to nine homeless people
@entity22 admitted it made mistakes that were ' unacceptable '
