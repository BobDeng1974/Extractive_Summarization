a holidaying family stumbled upon a huge 17 - foot @entity2 python as they picnicked in the @entity4			1
the collosal snake , one of the mostly deadly in the world which kills by asphyxiating its victims and swallows dead prey whole , was shot by the @entity10 after it emerged from the bushes			2
a video shows the dead snake seeming to go on forever as it is dragged into the open			0
those watching comment that they believe it was pregnant - with one adding : ' we really wanted to get it before it laid all its eggs '			0
@entity39 said they came across the python about 3pm on wednesday and his father , @entity42 , took the pictures and video of the snake which he sent in to @entity47			0
the park ranger confirmed it was a @entity2 python and shot it with a shotgun			1
@entity29 is holding a @entity2 python hunting contest beginning in january where a grand prize of $ 1,500 will be awarded to the person who kills the most pythons , and $ 1,000 will go to the person who bags the longest one			1
but despite the game visitors to @entity29 and the @entity61 were warned earlier this year to watch out for giant @entity2 after they began moving into areas popular with tourists			1
in @entity29 , the main @entity2 colony has for decades been @entity65 in the west of the state and it was hoped that the surrounding saltwater lakes and waterways would provide a natural barrier to stop them moving east			2
the snake seems to go on forever as it is pulled out into the picnic area in the @entity4 , @entity29 those standing around watching the dead snake being drawn out into the open commented that they believe it was pregnant but reptile experts found that even newly - hatched pythons - which can grow to 20ft long and weigh 200lbs - can survive in seawater for up to a month			2
although they are not considered a threat to humans , @entity2 pythons are vicious and can eat anything from birds to large mammals			0
in october 2011 , a 16 - foot python was found with a 76lb deer in its stomach after it was shot dead			0
a six - foot @entity91 alligator was found protruding from the mid-section of a 13 - foot @entity2 python in the @entity65 in 2005			1
the effort to eat the alligator killed both animals and in 2005 another @entity2 python was discovered split open with a 6ft alligator in its stomach			1
@entity29 â€™s problem with the reptiles dates back decades and has become so severe that residents have been banned from keeping pythons as pets			0
the cause of the epidemic has been blamed on either importers bringing them in from their native south - east @entity109 or @entity110 in 1992 , which destroyed a number of facilities which were holding thousands of @entity2 pythons .			0

the @entity2 python hunting contest begins next month
the discovery in @entity29 was *filmed* by the @entity34 family
tourists have been warned about the *dangers* of the deadly snake
