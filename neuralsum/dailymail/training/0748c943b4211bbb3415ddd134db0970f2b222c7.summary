by @entity0 published : 08:25 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 17 january 2013 it was supposed to be a fun , if risqué , event attended by scantily - clad students with worthy charitable motives			1
but the @entity6 brought notoriety to the @entity8 last night after footage of two revellers engaged in an intimate act was posted on the internet			1
in the explicit four - minute clip , a woman is seen standing with her male friend next to a pool table in a bar at the university			1
provocative look : students dress up - or down - for december 's @entity6 at @entity8 ( note : none of the students pictured were involved in the leaked video ) she is wearing a very short skirt while he is dressed in shorts , a cape and a headband			1
the unidentified couple embrace in a sustained clinch before they shed their clothes and appear to lose all inhibitions			1
the footage then shows them dashing off in opposite directions after a fellow guest almost catches them in the act			1
@entity42 film of the incident was recorded on to a mobile phone and passed among students at @entity8 , one of the country ’s leading universities			1
the steamy footage has since been distributed on the internet			1
some 2,200 students attended the ball on december 12 , which featured burlesque dancers and raised £ 140,000 for various charities			1
revellers were encouraged to wear skimpy and risqué outfits and given free contraception at the event , which is supposed to promote safe sex and is organised by the @entity61 , @entity8 ’s student union			1
cheaper tickets were priced at £ 60			2
the £ 80 vip tickets entitled holders to a place at one of eight tables with private booths , provided with canapés and copious amounts of cocktails and other drinks			2
the annual event has been criticised in previous years for its highly sexual tone			2
embarrassing : the @entity8 was also recently forced to closed down its @entity76 site where students submitted their most ' disgusting and hilarious confessions ' at one ball , the theme was ‘ @entity89 ’ and featured rooms which depicted the @entity83 carnival , the @entity84 , a @entity87 geisha ’s home and a chill - out area			1
one student said at the time : ‘ i think the message of safe sex is communicated but everyone is so drunk no one really takes any notice			2
’ the @entity61 has come under fire at @entity8 for the latest incident			2
writing in the online edition of @entity100 , the university ’s independent student newspaper , @entity102 said : ‘ absolutely no consideration was given to the students in the video or the reputation of the university			1
‘ it ’s unfortunate that the @entity61 are having to face the backlash for something related to the @entity6			2
’ a 20 - year - old student added : ‘ the whole ball is disgusting anyway			2
they pretend it ’s about safe sex and @entity116 to give them an excuse to wear nothing and get off with each other			0
’ the 2012 ball had already attracted censure , after some critics said its ‘ tribal ’ theme was dubbed racist			0
dozens of academics and university staff signed a petition protesting against the theme and calling for a public apology			0
@entity131 , chairman of the @entity132 , said of the ball : ‘ it ’s regrettable when a university has to go along this particular path in the name of promoting safer sex			0
’ he added : ‘ i think many parents whose children are at this university will be appalled			0
’ the @entity61 said it was concerned that the couple ’s right to privacy had been breached by whoever has posted the explicit clip online			1
a @entity61 spokesman said : ‘ putting cctv footage on the internet without permission could contravene the law			0
‘ that would namely be data protection laws and human rights legislation – the right to privacy			0
‘ engaging in sexual activity in a public place could also constitute an offence , depending on the form of sexual activity			0
‘ @entity163 is making sure the affected parties will be supported during this difficult time			0
’ yesterday the university declined to comment			0
extreme : the charity ball - for which former student @entity169 was once on the organising committee - has been slammed as ' irresponsible ' and ' decadent ' the @entity61 said it was concerned that the couple ’s right to privacy had been breached by whoever has posted the explicit clip online			1
a @entity61 spokesman said : ‘ putting cctv footage on the internet without permission could contravene the law			0
‘ that would namely be data protection laws and human rights legislation – the right to privacy			0
‘ engaging in sexual activity in a public place could also constitute an offence , depending on the form of sexual activity			0
