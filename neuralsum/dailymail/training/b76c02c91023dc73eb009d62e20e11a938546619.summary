by @entity0 published : 14:55 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 03:18 est , 23 august 2013 a police force will allow people with just four weeks training to interview criminal suspects alone in a bid to cut costs			1
@entity7 has revealed plans to recruit 32 response investigators on a starting salary of £ 20,020 a year to help free up police officers to be out on the street			1
a job description says they will be expected to manage their own caseload which will involve investigating crimes , gathering evidence , appearing in court and dealing with victims			1
controversial : @entity7 will employ people with four weeks of training to investigate crimes to cut costs but despite the onerous nature of the role , applicants do not need to have any policing qualifications or experience whatsoever			1
the advert states : ' having experience of criminal justice procedures and investigations is helpful but not essential			1
we 're looking for the right person with the right attitude for this role , we can teach you the rest through our bespoke 4 week training programme upon joining			0
' questions : @entity42 mp suggested some tasks should only be performed by experienced police officers @entity7 said @entity45 ( @entity46 ) will be ' removed from front line policing ' but allow officers to get back out onto the streets more quickly			1
but critics say the new recruits , who will employed on a fixed 18 - month contract , will amount to ' plastic police ' who should not be carrying out the work of more experienced officers			1
@entity42 , chair of the @entity57 , told @entity58 that certain tasks should never be done by non-police officers			0
' i think that interviewing suspects is along those lines , ' he told the newspaper			0
' a decent lawyer will make mincemeat out of an interview done by someone without the background and knowledge of a police officer			0
' @entity72 , chair of @entity73 , echoed his concerns and described the @entity46 as ' policing on the cheap '			2
' @entity7 has got cash for 18 months but when you employ police officers you employ them for 30 - odd years			2
the force can not afford to do this			0
it is policing on the cheap but it has got to be – because they only have the budget for 18 months , ' he told @entity85			2
but @entity86 , @entity87 , insisted the recruitment is justified			0
' this will allow for more officers to be out in the community ; one of the things that local people have told me matters most to them , ' she said			0
assistant chief constable @entity96 added : ' we are able to recruit and train these staff quicker than would be the case with officers and they will provide resilience within the @entity46 - but they are not a replacement for officers			0
