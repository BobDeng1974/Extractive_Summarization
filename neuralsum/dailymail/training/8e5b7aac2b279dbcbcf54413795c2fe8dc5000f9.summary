by @entity0 last updated at 8:43 pm on 9th december 2011 a retired @entity2 agent who vanished in @entity3 in 2007 reappeared in a video and a series of photographs which were sent to his family over the past year , it has emerged			1
it had been suspected by the @entity11 government that @entity12 was dead			1
however @entity11 officials revealed earlier this year that they had received proof he was alive			1
it has now emerged that his family were sent a video and a series of photographs of him last year it has now emerged that a video was emailed to his family in november last year in which he pleaded with the @entity11 government to meet the demands of his unidentified captors			1
it transformed a mysterious disappearance into a hostage standoff with an unknown kidnapper			0
' i have been treated well			0
but i need the help of the @entity11 government to answer the requests of the group that has held me for three and a half years , ' mr @entity12 says			1
' and please help me get home			0
' the 54 - second video showed mr @entity12 looking haggard but unharmed , sitting in front of what appeared to be a concrete wall			1
@entity12 went missing in @entity3 in 2007 he had lost considerable weight , particularly in his face , and his white shirt hung off him			1
there were no signs of recent mistreatment			0
but mr @entity12 , who has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure , implored the @entity11 to help him quickly			1
' i am not in very good health , ' he says			1
' i am running very quickly out of diabetes medicine			0
' the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) saw the video and obtained a government transcript of mr @entity12 's statement soon after it arrived last year but did not immediately report it because the @entity11 government said doing so would complicate diplomatic efforts to bring him home			1
now , those efforts appear to have stalled , @entity11 relations with @entity3 have worsened and mr @entity12 's wife , @entity62 , of @entity63 , @entity64 , is expected to release the video herself in a desperate attempt to make contact with whoever is holding her 63 - year - old husband			1
that represents a sharp change in strategy in a case that for years the @entity11 treated as a diplomatic issue rather than a hostage situation			0
mrs @entity76 has issued many public statements over the years , but she typically directed them to her missing husband or to the government of @entity3			1
in the nearly five years that mr @entity12 has been missing , the @entity11 government has never had solid intelligence about what happened to him			1
he had been retired from the @entity2 for years and was working as a private investigator when he traveled to @entity3 in march 2007			0
his family has said an investigation into cigarette smuggling took him to @entity86 , a resort island where @entity11 need no visa to visit			1
the prevailing @entity11 government theory had been that @entity76 was arrested by @entity3 intelligence officials to be interrogated and used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with @entity93			0
desperate : diplomatic efforts to bring missing former @entity2 agent @entity12 home have stalled			1
his wife @entity62 , pictured , is expected to release the video of her husband in an attempt to make contact with whoever is holding him but as every lead fizzled and @entity3 repeatedly denied any involvement in his disappearance , many in the @entity11 government believed @entity76 was probably dead			1
the surprise arrival of the video and photographs quickly changed that view but did little to settle the question of his whereabouts			1
the video contained tantalizing clues suggesting @entity76 was not being held in @entity3 at all , but rather in @entity115 , hundreds of miles from where he disappeared			2
the photographs , which arrived a few months after the video , contained hints that @entity76 might be in @entity120			2
despite the lengthy investigation , several @entity11 officials said , @entity93 still has no idea who is holding @entity76 , where he is or who holds the key to bringing him home			0
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions			0
disappeared : the retired @entity2 agent went missing following a visit to @entity86 in @entity3 , a resort island where @entity11 need no visa to visit a father of seven , @entity76 addressed his remarks to ' my beautiful , my loving , my loyal wife , @entity62 , ' as well as his children and his grandson			2
he apparently did not know he also has a granddaughter , who was born in 2008			0
@entity143 and friends confirmed that it was @entity76 in the video , and authorities also compared his face with computer - generated images that estimate aging			1
the video prompted secretary of state @entity150 to announce publicly in march that @entity76 was alive and urged the @entity3 to help find him			2
though the legacy of the 1979 hostage standoff with @entity3 looms over all relations between the two countries , @entity152 did not refer to @entity76 as a hostage in march and she softened the @entity11 rhetoric toward @entity159			0
the video also helped initiate a series of discreet discussions between @entity11 and @entity3 officials , conversations that @entity3 president @entity161 said in september were producing good results			1
demands : the video of @entity12 prompted @entity11 secretary of state @entity150 to announce publicly in march that he was alive and urged the @entity3 to help find him not long after @entity152 's remarks , the @entity76 family received a series of photos of @entity76 dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit like the ones worn by detainees at the @entity11 military prison at @entity178 , @entity179			1
in these photos , @entity76 's hair and beard were much longer and he looked thinner			2
in each photo , he wore a different sign hung around his neck			0
one read , ' why you can not help me			0
' investigators determined that the video was routed through an internet address in @entity115 , suggesting that @entity76 might be held there			2
also , @entity194 wedding music played faintly in the background , officials said			0
the @entity194 people live primarily in @entity115 and @entity120 , just over @entity3 's eastern border			2
the photos , however , traced back to a different internet address , this one in @entity120			0
authorities do n't know whether those clues mean @entity76 was being held in @entity202 - a rugged , arid region that spans parts of @entity3 , @entity115 and @entity120 - or perhaps in the lawless tribal region along the border of @entity115 and @entity120			2
these areas are home to terrorists , militant groups and criminal organizations			0
none of these groups has a clear motive for picking up @entity76			0
but an @entity11 hostage , particularly one who used to work for the @entity11 government , would be considered a valuable commodity to any of them			0
some @entity11 officials believe the @entity3 government routed the video through @entity115 as a way to blame @entity76 's disappearance on someone else - most likely the @entity226 terrorist group @entity227			1
but as with every other possibility , the @entity11 has no proof			0
the video was accompanied by a demand that the @entity11 release prisoners , but officials said the @entity11 is not holding anyone matching the names on the list			1
it 's possible some of them may have been held by the @entity115 government at one point , but officials say the demand does n't offer any indication of who might be holding @entity76 and there 's been no more communication about it			2
@entity11 authorities have repeatedly analyzed the video and the apparently scripted remarks @entity76 made , looking for clues			2
optimistic : the video of @entity12 helped initiate a series of discreet discussions between @entity11 and @entity3 officials , conversations that @entity3 president @entity161 , pictured , said were producing results for instance , @entity76 said a ' group ' had held him for three and a half years , a word choice that could suggest a criminal organization or terrorist group , rather than a government			1
and he said he had been held ' here ' for that time , suggesting he had not been moved			0
over the past year , the hopefulness that initially followed the arrival of the video has faded			1
the meetings with the @entity3 have not provided a breakthrough , and @entity11 officials said the government was no longer as optimistic about the future of those talks			0
relations with @entity3 , meanwhile , have worsened			0
the @entity274 recently accused @entity3 intelligence agents of plotting to assassinate @entity277 's ambassador in @entity93			2
then a @entity279 watchdog released a report warning of @entity3 's nuclear ambitions , prompting the @entity11 and its @entity283 allies to issue new sanctions against @entity3 's financial system			2
most recently , a high - tech , stealth @entity287 drone was captured by @entity3 officials while on a surveillance mission over @entity3			2
the embarrassing mishap put sophisticated technology in @entity3 hands and provided public evidence of the kind of spying that 's been long suspected			0
the one bright spot in @entity93 's relationship with @entity159 was the release of two @entity11 hikers from an @entity3 prison in september			1
the @entity11 worked behind the scenes to secure that release but officials said @entity76 was not part of those discussions			0
the @entity76 family has not updated its website since june , when @entity76 wrote an open letter to her husband			1
' i am willing to do whatever is necessary to bring you home , ' she wrote			0
' at the same time i 'm at a loss as to how i can do that			0

@entity12 tells family ' i am not in very good health '
63 - year - old 's wife may release video in a desperate attempt to make contact with husband 's captors
