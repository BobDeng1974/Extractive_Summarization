@entity1 's biggest banks have admitted sending thousands of letters from fake debt collection agencies in a deliberate attempt to intimidate customers into paying up			1
in a series of letters to the @entity8 , several of the biggest names in banking admit they have sent misleading letters to tens of thousands of customers who are struggling to repay their debts			1
they now face the prospect of a full - scale inquiry by @entity18 , who have condemned the ‘ menacing ’ practice			1
@entity21 chief @entity20 acknowledged the bank had used a number of ' debt collection brands ' to ' encourage ' customers to settle their debts @entity26 , @entity27 chairman of the treasury committee said : ‘ these letters seem to have been designed to pull the wool over consumers ’ eyes			1
' many customers will have been understandably misled			0
what is more , from these responses it seems that this practice was widespread			0
banks say that they have now stopped sending such correspondence but it should never have happened in the first place			2
’ @entity21 chief executive @entity20 acknowledged the bank had used a number of ‘ debt collection brands ’ to ‘ encourage ’ customers to settle their debts			2
he appeared to acknowledge the practice was designed to intimidate , saying the letters were meant to indicate to customers ‘ an escalation in the seriousness of the situation ’ by suggesting that outside debt collectors had been called in			2
he said the aim was to ‘ encourage the customer to re-engage ’			0
but he also claimed the use of other brands helped alert customers who had stopped opening letters from the bank that they were in trouble			2
@entity62 chief executive @entity61 said the letters ‘ reflect what had become a common industry practice in a sector that had come to put its own interests above those of its customers ’			1
treasury select committee chairman @entity26 said the letters ' seem to have been designed to pull the wool over consumers ’ eyes ' mr @entity61 said the bank had established an in - house solicitor @entity77 to help it collect debts			1
it also used the brands @entity80 and @entity82 to fool customers into thinking they were dealing with outside agencies			0
last year alone , @entity80 issued 423,000 letters to 119,000 customers , while @entity77 sent out a further 29,000 letters			2
he said he would not try to defend the practice , which has now been stopped			0
but he said it appeared to have been used to ‘ attract our customers ’ attention to the adverse consequences ’ of not paying their debts			0
@entity97 chief executive @entity96 said the banking giant had used four separate in - house brands to suggest it had called in outside help in collecting debts			1
mr @entity102 said the practice dated back to 1985 and only stopped in july this year after it was exposed by the @entity104			0
thousands of @entity97 customers struggling with their debts received letters from @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
in each case , the letter was actually from a part of @entity97 , although this was only made clear in the small print			1
@entity115 also admitted using a ‘ separately branded identity ’ when collecting debts , but insisted this had never involved posing as a legal firm			2
@entity121 mp @entity120 , a member of the @entity8 , said it was clear that an inquiry was now needed into a practice that was ‘ obviously designed to intimidate people ’			1
public anger over the practice erupted earlier this year when payday loan firm @entity128 was ordered to ordered to pay £ 2.6 million in compensation to 45,000 customers last month , following an investigation by the @entity132 ( @entity132 )			0
the @entity133 are now investigating whether @entity128 may have breached a number of laws , including the @entity136 and the @entity137 which outlaws the harassment of debtors			0
the move came after it emerged that @entity128 , which charges interest of up to 4,000 per cent on loans , sent letters in the names of two fictitious law firms in a bid to pressure customers into settling their debts			0
it has since emerged that the practice is widespread among financial institutions , utilities and even some public bodies , such as the @entity155 , which has now stopped .			0
