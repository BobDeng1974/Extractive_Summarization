@entity1 's daughter @entity0 , 12 , was sent sexualised messages by an online pervert on @entity4 two mothers have slammed police for failing to act after their daughters were targeted by an online predator			1
both @entity1 and @entity10 's young daughters were sent sexualised messages by an online pervert on @entity4 - but police refused to investigate as no offence had been committed			1
ms @entity1 's daughter @entity0 , 12 , was sent a message by the man after accepting a friend request from someone pretending to be a 17 - year - old boy			1
after the horrified mother saw the provocative messages , she challenged the man herself , pretending to be @entity0			1
ms @entity1 , 34 , from @entity22 , said : ' there were four or five messages that he sent , before he actually blocked me			0
i think i scared him			0
' you can only find my daughter on @entity4 if you have a mutual friend and this guy was friends with 100 of her school friends , so she thought he was from school			2
' after tackling the pervert , @entity1 posted the messages on her own account to warn other parents of the dangerous predator			2
she said : ' i shared it because i would say 90 per cent of my daughter 's school were on his profile and he was talking to her friends and his profile had about 300 - 400 friends and they were all under 15			0
' in the case of ms @entity10 's daughter @entity49 , 13 , the sick man threatened to post explicit pictures on her @entity4 wall - which all of her friends would have then seen - if she did not play along with his sordid messages			1
the pictures were not of @entity49 , but it is thought that he planned to post them online as if they were her			0
ms @entity10 , from @entity56 , @entity57 , said : ' when i first saw the messages i flipped out , but i did n't to play the role of a paedophile hunter and lead him on because i did n't want him to think that my daughter was interested in him in anyway at all			1
' ms @entity1 challenged the man ( pictured left and writing in grey ) when she found the messages on @entity0 's @entity4 ( @entity0 's messages in blue ) after the horrified mother saw the provocative messages , she challenged ( in blue ) the man ( writing in grey ) herself , pretending to be @entity0 both mothers contacted @entity70 but the force did not take any action on either occasion			1
ms @entity1 was told that no offence had been committed so officers could not do anything about the messages			2
she said : ' i felt disgusted by it			0
if nothing is done then surely we are sending a message out to these men that this is acceptable			0
' ms @entity10 , who says the police never responded to her complaint , said : ' it was upsetting and annoying			1
i understand they ca n't follow up everyone of these case because it takes a lot of time , but if they did chase them up there would be less of them			0
' both mothers admitted that they do not like their daughters being on @entity4 , but they 'd rather allow it than running the risk of the girls setting up a secret account			1
a @entity70 spokesman said : ' unfortunately , there are people out there that do want to engage with people who are younger than themselves			0
' young people can help themselves by not engaging with them			0
parents have a role to play in it , children have a role to play in it and we have a role to play in it once a crime has been committed			2
' we are aware of mrs @entity10 's complaint and we have taken it seriously and given her advice as to how to prevent this happening in the future			0
