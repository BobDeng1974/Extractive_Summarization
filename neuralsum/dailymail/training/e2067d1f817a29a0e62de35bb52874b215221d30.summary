by @entity0 @entity1 discovered he had won more than 120 times when he contacted @entity3 and @entity4 @entity1 thought he might be unluckier than most			1
while friends and family seemed to be regularly winning cash prizes on the @entity9 , his numbers had not come up for years			2
so the 80 - year - old contacted @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , which runs the scheme , and was staggered to discover that he had won 124 times over the past decade			1
he is now celebrating a @entity14 windfall of £ 5,325 after the cheques were mailed – plus a 125th pay - out for £ 2,094.94 in compensation to make up for the interest he lost out on			1
mr @entity1 , who has four grandchildren , said yesterday that the happy ending to his story should serve as a lesson to other bond holders who could be sitting on a pot of unclaimed cash			1
‘ i rang to ask if they had lost me in the system , ’ said the keen fisherman from @entity29 , @entity30			2
‘ they initially found i had won 10 times this year but i had n’t received any winnings			1
‘ two hours later i got a call from the manager saying i had won more than 120 times			2
‘ when i took the cheques to the bank the cashier could n’t believe it			0
he nearly blew up the machine trying to process them			0
‘ i just want to urge people – particularly those like me who have endured a long , dry spell – to check and see if they have won as it could be a nice @entity14			1
‘ i have to survive on pensions worth a combined £ 170 - a - week and this money could have made a big difference to my life			1
‘ as it is , i ’ve had to drop out of clubs i was involved in – such as diving and fishing			0
i just could n’t afford the fuel costs of a 40 - mile round - trip to the dive club , for instance , let alone trips to @entity61 or @entity62 to go sea fishing as much as i ’d like			0
’ mr @entity1 said his first win on the @entity9 was a £ 5 prize in the late 1950s			1
‘ i nearly tore the envelope up , thinking it was a tax demand from the revenue ’ , he said			0
‘ it was only my mother telling me to have a look at what was inside first that stopped me			0
’ he steadily built up his investment in bonds during a varied working life in which he spent 12 years as quartermaster on the @entity79 passenger liner , followed by stints in the merchant navy and as a supplier of turf , before eventually settling down to run a wool shop in @entity29 with his former wife			0
the couple divorced after the business closed in 1999 , by which point mr @entity1 had amassed the maximum £ 20,000 premium bondholding allowed			1
when the limit was increased to £ 30,000 in 2003 – and the top prize raised to £ 1million – he gradually raised his holding to the new limit			0
his problems seem to have started the following year , when an @entity3 letter to him was returned as ‘ undeliverable ’ by @entity96			0
@entity3 told the @entity97 that , while it was still investigating what happened , usually in such a situation it would assume that the customer had moved house and wait for him to contact them , which happened only this september			0
a spokesman apologised for the delay in getting mr @entity1 ’s winnings to him .			2

@entity1 won £ 5,325 over ten years without knowing it
the 80 - year - old had been relying on his pensions to get by
the fisherman is urging others to check to see if they have been as lucky
