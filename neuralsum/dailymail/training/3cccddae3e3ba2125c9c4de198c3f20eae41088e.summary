@entity0 may have to wait a while to become a team captain on @entity3 , but in many ways he is already emulating his father , @entity5 , as a rugby player			1
the 22 - year - old @entity7 has been a successful skipper at @entity8 , led a national side and made the unorthodox transition from tall fly - half to athletic and skillful forward			1
following in his dad ’s footsteps all the way to @entity18 and @entity20 recognition will require this season ’s giant strides to continue for some time at club level , but the youngest of three @entity0 brothers is showing considerable promise			1
@entity0 has recently signed a new deal with @entity27 after a string of impressive performnces a young @entity30 ( right ) pictured with his dad @entity5 and prince @entity32 at @entity20 training session last month , his outstanding performances for the @entity35 were rewarded with a new two - year contract — as further proof that his alternative route into the game has served him well			1
instead of the modern staple of graduating from an academy , @entity30 played for @entity43 in @entity44 before completing a geography degree at @entity46 , which significantly enhanced his rugby development and left some impressive entries on his c.v			1
it led him to the national stadium and later to the role of @entity54 captain			2
‘ i was captain of my uni team in the final year and we went unbeaten that season , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i had a very successful three years up there and played at @entity8 three times			0
we beat @entity61 twice — in my first and third year — but we lost to @entity62 in the second year			2
that was our one defeat in my three years there			0
‘ it was a great experience playing at @entity8 and hopefully i ’ll be back there some day			0
in the final year , because i was captain , i collected the trophy			1
my dad was there on the front row but it was n’t him who presented it to me			0
’ the 22 - year - old has made the unorthodox transition from tall fly - half to athletic and skillful forward @entity81 , pictured in action against @entity83 in 1980 , captained the @entity20 having a familiar rugby name has not always been a blessing			1
when he was younger , @entity0 felt being a @entity0 meant he was vulnerable to unfair suggestions of nepotism , but over time he has found his father ’s background helpful			1
‘ when i was younger it was probably a bit of a burden because people would say , “ you ’re only playing because of your dad ” , ’ he said			0
‘ but when you get to this level , you ca n’t bluff your way through and people understand that			0
i still get some comments but i just ignore them			0
it is beneficial because he knows a lot about the game and offers advice , but does n’t get too involved			0
’ the game is very different now compared to when @entity5 was a @entity108 - winning national icon in the late seventies and early @entity110			2
father and son have enjoyed light - hearted comparisons between their eras			1
‘ i ’ve watched a couple of his games and it ’s completely different , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity0 , in action for sale against @entity119 , is tackled by @entity120 ‘ some of the stories he comes out with , about old - school rugby … you would n’t get away with it now ! it ’s quite amusing to watch , but i have n’t seen many of his games because it was so long ago — 10 years before i was born			1
’ the game is much cleaner these days than it was in @entity5 ’s pomp			0
‘ back then , you would have had players sent off every five minutes if there had been all the cameras and replays there are now , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity137 jokes that it was tougher in those days and i would n’t have lasted five minutes in the @entity109 and @entity110 ! ’ having played rugby at @entity43 — his dad ’s old @entity141 club — since the age of seven , @entity0 relished the chance to work with @entity145 and @entity146 when he broke into the first team as a teenager			1
@entity0 captained the @entity46 rugby team while he studied geography at the institute by then , he had been advised that his physique was more conducive to playing in the pack , rather than the back - line			1
‘ when i got to about 16 , the coaches suggested i moved into the forwards , ’ he said			0
‘ before , i was probably the tallest fly - half around — it got a bit ridiculous after a while ! ’ while his role as @entity163 chairman and the family textile business keeps him busy , @entity5 finds time to watch @entity165 — as well as older brother @entity166 , who still plays at @entity43			1
he is full of paternal pride but plays down his role in his son ’s rugby education			2
‘ he has done really well this season , after missing most of last season with injuries , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity0 is the youngest of three boys , so whatever games were being played on the lawn he had to get stuck in with older brothers and i think that has helped him			2
he ’s always been a good sportsman , a good ball - player and once he moved into the forwards , he has made great progress			0
@entity182 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity184 after a @entity186 match between @entity18 and @entity187 ‘ i just try to give him some advice , that ’s all			2
i was quite keen that he did his degree before going into rugby full - time			0
he really enjoyed university rugby and was lucky to be at @entity194 when they had a really good team			0
it meant he got to play at @entity8 three times , which he really enjoyed			0
’ @entity5 will be at the @entity199 in @entity200 tomorrow to watch @entity201 against @entity202 in the @entity203			2
one day , he may be able to watch him represent his country at @entity8 — but he wo n’t burden him with inflated expectation			0
‘ i do n’t want to put any pressure on the lad , ’ he said			0
‘ first , he has to establish himself as a @entity203 player and if he does that , who knows what might happen ? ’			2

@entity0 is the son of former @entity18 and @entity20 captain @entity81
@entity30 plays for @entity35 in the @entity203
