motorists are to be hit with a £ 1 charge every time they drop off family or friends at @entity5 and they will face a fine if they linger for over 10 minutes			1
the plan has been met with anger from visitors and taxi drivers but airport officials insist the fee and £ 30 parking fine are necessary to reduce congestion and improve safety in drop - off zones			1
drivers will be monitored with an automatic number plate recognition ( @entity22 ) system when the charges come into effect on january 7 , @entity17 and @entity18 reported			2
motorists will be hit with a £ 30 fine if they stay for longer than 10 minutes in the drop - off zone @entity28 , @entity30 airport ’s managing director , told the newspaper that management are concerned about the safety of visitors and staff			1
she said : ‘ an increase in traffic using the airport has resulted in some examples of dangerous behaviour among drivers and the new system will allow us to better manage that behaviour			0
’ but the plan has been blasted by non-airport taxi drivers , who say they were not consulted before the charges were announced			1
they warn that it will likely lead to higher fares for airport journeys as only official airport taxis will be exempt from the charge , and there are fears the fee could increase in the future			1
and the worry on a larger scale is that other airports could follow suit , charging for what could be a drop off of a matter of seconds			0
unfair ? non-official airport taxis will be forced to pay the £ 1 fee every time they drop off customers @entity70 , a taxi representative for the @entity72 union , said : ‘ it seems an unfair charge to be passed onto the customers			2
we do n’t want to do that but it ’s a cost that ’s being imposed that we have very little control over			0
