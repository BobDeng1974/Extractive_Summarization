with six games to go - five for @entity2 and seven for @entity3 - there are just four points separating the bottom five sides in the @entity6			1
as things stand the three promoted clubs , @entity3 , @entity9 and @entity2 , would make an immediate return to the championship , but @entity12 and @entity13 are teetering on the brink			1
even @entity15 and @entity16 are not quite out of the dogfight , although our reporters are confident that the relegated clubs will come from the five teams currently at the foot of the table			2
@entity24 is hoping to fire @entity2 to safety , but will his goals be enough to save them ? can any of the bottom three climb to safety ? or will the clubs above them succumb to fiendishly difficult fixture lists ? @entity34 's reporters give their verdicts on the closest relegation run - in for years ... @entity37 @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity13			1
can i add an if ? if @entity39 starts scoring regularly again			0
if not , @entity13 will stay up by the skin of their teeth and the bottom three go down , which should act as a warning to @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and the rest involved in the @entity49 at the top of the @entity51			2
@entity13 's fans deserve better			2
but do n't get me started on that			0
@entity39 has nine @entity6 goals so far , but he 'll need to start scoring again for @entity9 to stay up @entity13 's fans , who were dejected after their defeat to @entity58 last week , deserve more @entity12 @entity59 ( home ) - april 18 @entity58 ( away ) - april 25 @entity61 ( home ) - may 2 @entity9 ( home ) - may 9 @entity64 ( away ) - may 16 @entity65 ( home ) - may 24 @entity15 @entity67 ( away ) - april 25 @entity68 ( home ) - may 2 @entity70 ( home ) - may 9 @entity72 ( away ) - may 16 @entity9 ( home ) - may 24 * @entity2 ( home ) - date to be arranged @entity13 @entity75 ( away ) - april 25 @entity72 ( home ) - may 2 @entity68 ( away ) - may 9 @entity3 ( home ) - may 16 @entity61 ( away ) - may 20 @entity78 ( away ) - may 24 @entity9 @entity68 ( away ) - april 18 @entity3 ( home ) - april 25 @entity70 ( away ) - may 2 @entity12 ( away ) - may 9 @entity75 ( home ) - may 16 @entity15 ( away ) - may 24 @entity2 @entity70 ( home ) - april 25 @entity59 ( away ) - may 2 @entity67 ( away ) - may 9 @entity54 ( home ) - may 16 @entity3 ( away ) - may 24 * @entity15 ( away ) - date to be arranged @entity3 @entity82 ( home ) - april 18 @entity9 ( away ) - april 25 @entity78 ( home ) - april 29 @entity54 ( home ) - may 2 @entity72 ( home ) - may 9 @entity13 ( away ) - may 16 @entity2 ( home ) - may 24 note : fixtures in may subject to change for television schedule			1
the bottom seven in the @entity6 as it stands , with @entity3 bottom , but holding a game in hand @entity96 @entity2 , @entity12 and @entity13 @entity9 to survive as they have made it through a nightmare sequence of fixtures with their spirit and desire intact			1
they can take points from any of their final six games - even though only two are at home and they have won only once away this season			0
@entity3 's fixture list gives them a chance with five home games plus away fixtures at @entity9 and @entity13			1
there may be too much to do but they suddenly have a chance having found the winning formula and it may supply the required inspiration			0
@entity13 and @entity12 face the double whammy of flagging form and brutal fixtures and @entity2 are running out of games			1
@entity121 ( left ) and @entity122 are feeling the strain as their teams slide towards relegation with their improvement under @entity130 , none of our reporters think @entity15 will go down @entity132 - @entity131 @entity12 , @entity9 and @entity3 @entity12 have a dreadful run - in and simply look awful			1
that 's not to say @entity2 have been much better but at least against @entity78 they showed they are still fighting			0
when i saw @entity12 at @entity82 earlier this month , they were spineless			0
@entity9 have a reasonable run of fixtures but they and @entity3 have been in the mess all season - i ca n't see why that would change in the next few weeks			2
@entity9 have been in the bottom three for most of the season , and they 'll need a big improvement to stay up @entity143 @entity12 , @entity3 and @entity2 @entity12 's run - in is just awful whereas @entity9 's looks manageable			1
at this stage of the season it 's usually about momentum			0
@entity2 and @entity3 have gained some but it looks too little , too late			2
@entity2 have gained a little bit of momentum under @entity152 , but it is too little too late for them @entity154 @entity2 , @entity12 and @entity13 this is a big call but i can see both @entity3 and @entity9 dragging themselves out of the mire			1
whenever i 've seen @entity3 this season , they have competed until the last kick and the same goes for @entity9			2
they look ready to fight for their lives			0
@entity12 have a taxing run in and simply are n't playing well enough			0
@entity13 , meanwhile , have been wretched all season and , to this observer , look bereft of the unity and resilience you need to get out of such a hole			0
@entity3 have always fought until the final whistle , and that will go for the relegation run - in as well @entity13 have been abject all season and look bereft of ideas as they struggle to stay in the top flight @entity174 @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity12 @entity9 have a much easier run - in than @entity2 , @entity12 and @entity13 , and i ’m backing @entity177 to pull off the great escape after being written off from the start			1
@entity3 also have a decent set of fixtures – not to mention a game in hand – but i think they will drop out and @entity122 will keep @entity13 up - just			2
@entity184 celebrates his goal against @entity54 , and he could do enough to keep @entity13 up @entity186 @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity2 @entity12 's run - in looks horrendous with relegation a fitting reward for a side that has underperformed all season			1
@entity122 is not the man to save @entity13			0
yes , they beat @entity193 's @entity54 ( who does n't ? ) but normal service was resumed when @entity58 trounced them 4 - 1 on home turf			0
final - day defeat at @entity3 will condemn @entity2 and complete @entity199 's great escape while @entity39 will rediscover his shooting boots to hand @entity9 the perfect parting gift and cap a fairytale year for the brilliant @entity177			1
@entity13 boss @entity122 watches on as his side lose to @entity58 - he is not the man to save them @entity3 's final day game at home to @entity2 will be crucial as @entity199 looks to keep his side up @entity207 @entity13 , @entity9 and @entity2 i ca n't see @entity13 getting a single point from their remaining away games at @entity75 , @entity68 , @entity61 and @entity78			1
@entity9 have n't turned draws into wins and @entity2 go to @entity3 on the final day			1
it looks winner - takes all in that one			0
@entity3 have five of their seven fixtures at home plus trips to @entity13 and @entity9			1
i think they can provide the ' miracle ' and ensure one promoted team stays up			0
@entity2 and @entity3 will battle it out for survival , but the @entity223 club will not have enough to stay up @entity224 @entity3 , @entity9 and @entity12 @entity12 's final run - in is the worst of any of the relegation - threatened clubs , facing @entity59 , @entity61 , @entity64 and @entity65 in four of their remaining six , and i believe they 're doomed			1
of the three already in the relegation places , i feel @entity2 showed against @entity16 and @entity78 they have what it takes to stay up helped by @entity24 's goals			2
@entity3 and @entity9 are not strong enough to beat the drop			2
@entity3 have shown signs of pulling off a miracle , but do they have the quality to stay up this season ? @entity2 have shown enough to suggest they will beat the drop , and @entity24 's goals can prove decisive @entity238 @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity12 @entity3 and @entity2 have shown an improvement in recent weeks , but i fear they 've left themselves too much to do			1
@entity12 have got some awful fixtures ahead			0
they still have to play : @entity59 , @entity61 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
their other two games are against @entity58 - who are flying under @entity244 - and fellow relegation scrappers @entity9			0
i 'm not sure there 's enough points in those games for @entity121 's side to escape			0
@entity12 lack momentum and have the most difficult run - in of any of the sides left in the relegation scrap @entity254 @entity9 , @entity12 and @entity13 yeah , that 's right , @entity3 and @entity2 both escape the drop			1
as outlandish as it once seemed , the pair now have a little bit of momentum - a lot of it in @entity3 's case - and that can not be said of @entity13 and @entity12			1
@entity2 will beat both @entity70 and @entity54 at home , while a draw at @entity3 on the final day could prove enough to see them both to safety			1
@entity3 also face @entity54 - and that is the biggest guarantee of three points as there is at the moment			0
@entity13 , meanwhile , simply are not capable of saving themselves and , with trips to @entity61 and @entity78 to sign off the season , their final home game with @entity3 will determine their fate			2
lose and they will probably be relegated with a points total in the region of 32			0
@entity12 have lost three on the spin and have a horrendous run - in during which they 'll be lucky to win another game			0
as for @entity9 , they have winnable matches but the goals have dried up and that could cost them dear			0
@entity13 are in danger of being brushed aside in the battle to avoid relegation , and look likely to go down			2

@entity3 , @entity9 and @entity2 hoping to avoid going straight back down
@entity12 and @entity13 also in danger of going down
@entity15 and @entity16 are closer to safety , but could get sucked in
