several major @entity1 museums have banned selfie sticks - extendable smartphone devices which allow photos to be taken from up to a meter away - on the grounds of safety concerns			1
despite the growing army of selfie - obsessed tourists and locals alike who trudge through the world brandishing their pole - equipped camera phones , many establishments feel they pose multiple hazards			2
' i am pro-selfie , just not pro-selfie stick , ' the @entity16 's chief digital officer @entity15 tells @entity18			2
the @entity16 is still pondering whether a ban might be necessary , while the @entity29 claims it has ' never ' permitted visitors to take photos using camera - extension devices			1
these safety concerns are not unfounded , even in the days before selfie sticks			1
gadgets be gone : a sign displayed outside @entity30 's @entity45 , which has banished selfie sticks the @entity16 suffered a mishap in 2010 when a woman fell and slashed a six - inch tear into @entity52 ’s the actor painting , for example			1
in 2006 , a visitor at the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , had a similar fall , this time ' demolishing ' three @entity60 vases ; and the same year , at the @entity63 , @entity62 's bronze @entity61 statue was ' groped and vomited upon ' during an after - hours museum party			0
@entity67 humans , it appears , can pose quite enough of a risk on their own , without introducing long metal poles into the equation			0
the selfie stick trend first emerged in @entity72 several years ago , before spreading worldwide and cementing its popularity over @entity74 , when the gadgets became one of the bestselling gifts of the season			0
with all its fans , however , the selfie stick has plenty of bans , extending far beyond museum walls			0
@entity85 ’s largest indoor venue , @entity87 ’s @entity86 , recently banned them on health and safety grounds ; as did the whole of @entity92 , which has imposed steep fines for people using them due to the possible side effects of ' bluetooth interference ' .			0

@entity30 's @entity29 and @entity31 have banned selfie sticks , along with @entity33 's @entity32
