as managers up and down the land were frantically trying to make final adjustments to their squads on deadline day , @entity1 boss @entity0 could afford to put his feet up			1
heading into the international break , @entity0 ’s side sit third in the @entity9 having won four of their first five games back in second tier			1
inheriting a club in total disarray last summer , @entity0 has shown himself to be an expert in squad building			1
means business : @entity0 has revamped a @entity1 since taking over at @entity18 in little over a year in the @entity19 , he has transformed a playing squad with no coherence , direction or belief into a well - drilled machine that looks capable of back - to - back promotions			1
@entity0 has overseen a clearout of massive proportions , with 15 players leaving @entity1 since he joined			1
in his own methodical and calm way , he has rejuvenated the club , giving it a clear identity and direction in building his side around a first - rate academy that was criminally ignored by predecessors @entity36 , @entity37 and , to a lesser extent , @entity39			2
@entity0 has fielded the same starting xi in each of @entity1 ’ five league games so far this season			1
of that side , @entity43 is the oldest player at just 28 , while three academy products - goalkeeper @entity46 , centre back @entity48 and full back @entity49 - have been key , with a further three home - grown wanderers on the bench			0
chief executive @entity53 and owner @entity54 have invested total faith in the former @entity57 manager to turn their club around ( in fairness , they gave the same backing to @entity62 , just this time the manager knew what he was doing )			0
all smiles : wolves sit third in the @entity9 after winning four of their opening five fixtures there are still five more players on the transfer list and training away from the first - team in the shape of defenders @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , winger @entity79 and striker @entity80 , though @entity0 has not let that disrupt his building of what is now very much his team			1
the signings along the way have been in keeping with his vision of a young , hungry group of players			0
this summer , @entity91 winger @entity90 , midfielder @entity92 and versatile former @entity94 captain @entity93 have enhanced a squad stregnthened last season with the additions of the likes of @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
what is has left @entity1 with - excluding the exiled five - is a squad of 26 which includes no fewer than 13 academy graduates , with a further two in @entity107 and @entity108 impressing out on loan in @entity110 with @entity111			1
another out on loan is talented teenage centre back @entity113 , signed this summer from @entity114			0
shrewd move : wanderers landed @entity94 skipper @entity93 in the summer remarkably , captain @entity117 is the only player in @entity0 ’s squad over the age of 30 , while there are only four over the age of 27			2
@entity0 has not backed youth for youth ’s sake , just as he has n’t sold for the sake of it either			2
@entity128 , for example , fitted in to the bracket of high - earners signed by @entity36 , yet @entity0 recognised the brilliant talent he had on his hands and has moulded @entity1 ’ attacking structure around the @entity135 winger			1
@entity128 is probably the best wide man outside the top flight and has been rewarded for his loyalty - as may @entity1 fans be come may			1
with no standout side coming down from the @entity141 , the promotion race looks set to be wide open and there is no reason why @entity1 ca n’t emulate the recent achievements of @entity145 and @entity146 in earning back - to - back promotions			1
good week for ... @entity94			0
having lost top scorer @entity149 and captain @entity93 over the summer , @entity94 looked like they could struggle to make the top six in @entity110 heading into the start of the season			1
but following saturday ’s 3 - 1 win at @entity157 , @entity155 ’s side sit top of the third - tier tree			0
@entity94 had a similarly strong start last season , however , and ca n’t afford to fall away like they did if they are to win promotion			2
missing ? @entity94 lost striker @entity149 to @entity165 but are still scoring goals bad week for ... @entity167			0
@entity168 has run out for @entity169 following saturday ’s 5 - 0 defeat by @entity171			0
after an up - turn in fortunes following @entity169 ’s appointment in september last year , it has been a miserable 2014 for the @entity176			0
despite boasting one of the strongest squads in @entity179 they are yet to win this season and an immediate return to the third tier already looks like wishful thinking			0
that 's your lot ! @entity169 was sacked as manager of @entity188 on monday morning talent scout : @entity190 ( @entity191 ) did he mean it ? probably not , but @entity190 ’s debut goal for @entity191 following his release by @entity195 was one to savour			2
the 21 - year - old forward earned three points for @entity199 ’s side with a curling 40 - yard effort from the touchline to seal a 3 - 2 win at @entity203			2
@entity190 ’s career has stalled badly since making his @entity195 debut in the @entity141 in january 2012 but with time on his side and first - team opportunities available in @entity179 , he can add plenty more to his goal tally			0
what a strike ! @entity190 is mobbed by his @entity191 team - mates after scoring against @entity203			0

wolves lie third after promotion from @entity110 last season
@entity128 has caught the eye for @entity0 's side
the manager has *dragged* @entity1 up off their knees over the last year
