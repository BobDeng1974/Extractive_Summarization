@entity53 was also taken to ensure that loaves of bread eaten by the characters were just like those preserved among the ruined city by the ash , and a fish stall in the film only sold the types eaten at the time of the eruption			2

' i think what really fascinated me is that @entity2 was the greatest historical disaster of the ancient world and it had never really been put on a film correctly , ' the director told @entity107			2
' there were three threats that hit @entity2			2
there was the earthquake , the tsunami and then the pyroclastic surge when the volcano blew its top and @entity2 was buried for almost 2,00 years			1
i wanted to tell the true story of the disaster , a spectacular story			0
' the fictitious part of the story is about the characters			0
but many of the characters are based on plaster casts of the people who were left			0
one of the most famous images is the two entwined lovers			0
i was facinated by that			0
' @entity128 : filmmakers used laser scans of streets and houses and computer technology to ensure that building dimensions of the recreation were the same size as those destroyed almost 2,000 years ago he said that new computer technology , as well as his research , has enabled him to bring an authenticity to the disaster that was not possible for earlier directors			1
despite most moviegoers will be coming to the film in the knowledge that @entity2 will be wiped out , mr @entity7 said there is still enough action and drama in his epic to to keep people guessing			1
the director , who was born in @entity152 , @entity153 , the home of the eastern end of @entity156 , said some characters survived the disaster despite the widespread destruction			0
when the volcano erupted , a cloud of ash and stones was thrown into the air , some 20 miles high , as well as molten rock and pumice spewed out over the course of two days			0

the actors are in there with the flames and ash			0
unpleasant for them , but very realistic , ' he told @entity191			0
mr @entity7 , who is married to model and actress @entity193 , said that one thing he was particularly proud of was the inclusion of the tsunami as part of the disaster as this had been documented in the ancient texts			0
lovers : one of the inspiration behind the film was a pair of casts left by the bodies of two entwined lovers performance : actor @entity21 stars in the historical epic which is a joint @entity16 @entity211 production doomed : despite most moviegoers will be coming to the film in the knowledge that @entity2 will be wiped out , mr @entity7 said there is still enough action and drama in his epic to to keep people guessing rising star : the film also features @entity22 , pictured , who plays @entity222 in @entity23 his team spent six years researching the doomed city , using laser scans of streets and houses and computer technology to ensure that building dimensions of the recreation were the same size as those destroyed almost 2,000 years ago			1
