when confronted with the sight of a charging hippo hungry for meat , most holidaymakers would run a mile			0
but one snap - happy couple stayed put to capture the beast in all its glory as it bounded towards them through an @entity10 swamp			2
@entity11 and @entity12 were holidaying in @entity13 when the animal bore its fangs at them during a safari			1
rather than run from the hungry animal , mr @entity20 , 38 , whipped out his camera			1
as his stunning collection of photographs show , the animal changed its mind at the last minute , waddling off in search of food elsewhere as their group 's motorboat kicked in			1
who 's there ? an angry hippopotamus made a dash for a group of tourists in @entity36 , @entity13 , with one of the group able to capture the moment it nearly reached their boat in a swamp closing in : the animal moved with ' astonishing ' pace said mr @entity20 , a professional photographer in the area with his wife , @entity45 not happy : the beast was far from pleased when the group of tourists brought their boat into its territory of the water the encounter was not without risk though , he said , with their guide hurriedly trying to start the boat 's engine as the hippopotamus closed in			1
' it was astonishing the speed the hippo moved and we were definitely in danger			2
' our guide decided to get us up close to a pod of hippos that were resting on a small island			2
as we were drifting towards them with the motor off , the dominant bull decided we were too close and started charging us			0
' it all happened very quickly and as the hippo was gaining valuable ground by the second , we were trying very hard to get the motor boat started			0
' after two unsuccessful attempts the motor finally started and we managed to get away			0
' incredibly , i managed to get a few photographs of the charge as we luckily escaped the angry hippo			0
' the pictures will always remind us how lucky we were			0
' get your own swamp : mr @entity20 was able to capture the beasts ' yellowed fangs and tongue in a stunning collection of photographs getting closer : the rest of the group remained in their seats as the guide tried to restart the boat , the animal growing ever closer off you go : eventually the tour 's boat restarted , with the animal pleased to see them leave just in the nick of time do n't bother coming back : while mr @entity20 said he was glad to have been able to capture the encounter , he said the images remind him of how much danger they were in at the time			1
