right , @entity63 was celebrating his eighth birthday at the @entity20 when he fell severely ill the @entity11 resort of @entity12 in @entity4 is popular with tourists ' it means that she is missing out on lots of opportunities , which breaks my heart			1
' @entity18 and [ her cousin ] @entity63 were both celebrating their birthdays whilst we were in @entity4 , which we hoped would make it a really special time for them			1
' sadly this is a birthday that we will never forget for all the wrong reasons			0
' she was taken to the on - site doctor , but the family were only advised to buy her over-the - counter treatment from a local pharmacy			0

' we felt that it was fair that we received a financial settlement of this order given that our family holiday was ruined by illness and due to the suffering we experienced then and thereafter			0
