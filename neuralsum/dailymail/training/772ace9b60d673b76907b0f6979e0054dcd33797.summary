@entity1 captain @entity0 will be keeping his fingers crossed for a home tie when the draw is made for the 2015 @entity5 on thursday			1
@entity0 's first seven ties were all at home , with @entity1 winning six of them to climb from the depths of a @entity12 / @entity11 relegation play - off to the brink of the top tier			1
the @entity17 's team then won away at @entity18 to book their place back in the @entity5			0
@entity0 will be hoping for a home tie when the draw is made for the 2015 @entity5 @entity5 @entity1 then stunned the @entity22 in @entity23 for their first victory at the elite level of the team competition since 1986 before losing narrowly to @entity27 in the quarter - finals			1
all those three ties were on clay and , with it being @entity32 's weakest surface , @entity0 knows an away tie would almost certainly mean another outing on the red stuff			2
@entity1 are unseeded so will be paired with one of the eight seeds for the first round , which takes place from march 6 - 8			0
they are only guaranteed to be away if they draw @entity43 's @entity42 , while a tie against @entity45 would require the drawing of lots			0
@entity32 has endured a frustrating year , but will be key to @entity1 's @entity5 hopes @entity49 121 @entity48 beat @entity50 in this year 's @entity5 clash against the @entity22 but should @entity1 draw either of this year 's finalists , @entity54 or @entity55 , the @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity27 or @entity22 , they would play at home			1
the highest - profile home tie under @entity0 's leadership came in april 2013 , when @entity1 recovered from 2 - 0 down to defeat @entity62 at the @entity63 in @entity64			1
with @entity32 likely to play and the potential of some of the world 's top players coming to visit , a home tie would provide the opportunity to play at a large arena and with the choice of surface up to @entity0 and his team			2
@entity75 reached the 2013 @entity77 third round but his ranking has plummeted to 269 the main barrier to further @entity81 success in @entity5 remains the lack of a world - class singles player to support @entity32			2
@entity48 , whose win over @entity50 was the crucial result in the @entity22 upset , has continued to make steady progress and is ranked at a career - high mark of 121			0
but @entity75 , another of @entity1 's recent @entity5 heroes , has slumped to 269 , and @entity48 is the only player other than @entity32 in the top 230			1
another option could be world no 144 @entity92 , who is in the process of applying for a @entity81 passport and could be eligible by march			0
the @entity95 is particularly at home on clay and @entity0 was keeping a close eye on him at the @entity77 .			0

@entity1 @entity5 captain @entity0 thinks home *advantage* is key
the draw for the 2015 @entity105 is made on thursday
@entity32 and co will face either @entity42 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity27 or @entity22
