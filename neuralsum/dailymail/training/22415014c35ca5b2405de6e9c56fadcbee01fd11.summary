pilots claimed yesterday that new @entity2 rules could force them to stay awake for 22 hours before landing a plane			1
the watering down of restrictions on flying hours and rest periods will make them over-tired and put lives at risk , they said			0
the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) has released a dossier of near - disasters , including three pilots falling asleep at the same time on a transatlantic flight to @entity17			1
' unsafe and discredited ' : @entity18 pilots union @entity12 has lost its battle to persuade @entity20 to vote against new @entity2 regulations for flying hours in another incident , a pilot said he and a colleague messed up a landing at the airport ‘ with possible fatal consequences ’ because they were ‘ punch - drunk with tiredness ’			1
a survey of 500 commercial pilots found 56 per cent had fallen asleep at the controls and nearly one in three woke up to find their co-pilot had also nodded off			2
@entity36 said tiredness was the major threat to passenger safety			2
but @entity12 lost its battle yesterday to persuade @entity2 mps to vote against the regulations , which will be brought in from 2015 unless they are rejected by the @entity42 later this year			1
the new regime was voted through by 387 votes to 218 , despite the @entity2 parliament ’s transport committee voting 21 - 13 against last week			1
mixed messages : the decision comes despite the @entity51 's own transport committee voting by 21 - 13 to reject the @entity53 plans amid safety fears the rules mean pilots can be asked to do seven early starts in a row – from as early as 3am – rather than just three ; and work up to 110 hours per fortnight rather than 95 , the union says			1
restrictions on how much time they can spend on standby , when a flight is delayed due to adverse weather conditions or technical problems , will also be lifted			0
this means that in extreme cases they could be awake for 22 hours before touching down			0
on some long - haul flights the number of pilots required to be on duty will be cut from three to two			0
@entity12 general secretary @entity73 said : ‘ it is a scandal that the unelected and unaccountable @entity75 can force through cuts to @entity18 flight safety that have been rejected by @entity20 on their own transport committee , @entity18 mps , pilots across @entity18 and @entity2 , scientists and the @entity18 flying public			1
’ evidence : the testimony also follows publication by the @entity86 of an incident report from a @entity89 pilot flying an @entity90 saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days and @entity94 , @entity96 mp and chairman of the @entity99 transport select committee , said : ‘ i agree with @entity12 ’s concerns that the proposed changes to @entity53 rules could endanger passenger safety			1
there is still time for the @entity18 and @entity2 to think again			2
’ the government and the @entity106 backed the shake - up			0
‘ pilot fatigue is a real risk in the aviation industry and we take the management of fatigue very seriously , ’ @entity86 chief executive @entity108 said			0
‘ fatigue has multiple causes , and must be managed in a practical , hands - on way , not simply by asking airlines and pilots to comply with a set of timetables			0
’ @entity122 , @entity122 transport spokesman , said : ‘ this is a sensible outcome			0
despite concerns from pilots ’ unions , these rules will not lower safety standards			2

comes despite @entity51 's transport committee rejecting rules amid safety fears
@entity18 pilots union @entity12 says regulations are ' unsafe and discredited '
