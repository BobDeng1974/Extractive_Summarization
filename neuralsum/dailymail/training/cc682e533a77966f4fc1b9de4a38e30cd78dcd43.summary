a @entity1 penalty in front of a virtually empty @entity3 gifted @entity4 the win against @entity6 in this @entity8 tie			1
@entity9 forced the match to be played behind closed doors as punishment for racists chants by the @entity16 champions ' fans during the game against @entity18 last december			1
the lack of atmosphere did little to distract @entity4 , though , as @entity21 drew a foul from @entity23 in the box and @entity1 did the rest from 12 yards			2

and ensuring their second @entity8 win started with two of @entity108 's @entity107 heroes			1
@entity21 , who scored the only goal of the summer 's final in @entity111 against @entity112 , was hacked down in the box by his name - sake @entity23 as he cut inside			0

@entity68 , the @entity146 's new record holder for the most touches in a single match , was largely kept as quiet as those in the @entity150 stands during a tense first 45 minutes			0
the former @entity152 and @entity153 midfielder touched the ball 204 times against @entity156 on saturday , meaning he was in possession on average every 26 seconds , but the 32 - year - old could n't find that same rhythm in a lifeless stadium			0
