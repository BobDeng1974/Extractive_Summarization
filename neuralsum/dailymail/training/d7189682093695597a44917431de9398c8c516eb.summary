a couple who who were asked to leave an @entity3 store because their seven - year - old autistic son was ' out of control ' claim they have been discriminated against			1
@entity9 was shopping with his wife @entity10 , 38 , and his son @entity11 at an @entity3 store in @entity13 , when he claims a security guard asked them to leave			1
mr @entity9 claims his autistic son had been putting his hands in the freezers and was running up and down the aisles in the store			1
@entity3 contends @entity11 was potentially endangering himself and other customers ' by striking the lids of freezer cabinets while wearing a heavy ring '			2
@entity9 , pictured with his wife @entity10 and his son @entity11 , seven , have claimed ' discrimination ' after they were asked to leave an @entity3 store in @entity13 because their son , who has autism , was running around the store and putting his hands in freezers ; the family has been given a £ 20 voucher from @entity3 the @entity3 store in @entity36 , @entity13 , where the @entity9 family was asked to leave by store security the 40 - year - old claims the security guard at the store on @entity42 , accused him of not being able to control @entity11			1
he said : ' i am absolutely furious			2
he was n't in a bad meltdown , but to be told you ca n't control your son is absolutely disgraceful			2
i could n't believe it			2
' mr @entity9 said he explained to the security guard that his son had autism , and later called @entity3 's head office to complain.the store sent him a £ 20 voucher			1
mr @entity9 said : ' i want to use the incident to raise awareness of disabled discrimination			1
' because @entity11 does n't need a wheelchair , people sometimes do n't realise his condition			2
' i 'm very passionate about the fact that awareness is n't there and often it 's the older generation that frown or do n't seem to understand			2
' mr @entity9 said his family had suffered ' discrimination '			1
@entity3 has said that it is investigating the incident and will take ' any action that may be appropriate ' ; pictured above is @entity67 , where the @entity3 store is located he said : ' when you have someone in that job , you have to have an awareness about what you can and ca n't say			1
' i think we 're a little bit behind in this country			0
' a spokesman for @entity3 said the company is ' opposed to all forms of discrimination '			1
' we are well aware of , and sympathetic to , the issues faced by the parents of autistic children and we try our utmost to make allowances for sometimes challenging behaviour in store			2
however , we must also have regard for the safety of our other customers and staff			0
' the spokesman said a security guard approached the @entity95 and asked them ' to calm ' @entity11 down and warned they they would have to leave the store if they could n't			1
@entity3 gave the family a £ 20 voucher , the spokesman said , as a ' gesture of goodwill '			1
' we offered them as a gesture of goodwill and have already returned to shop in the same store , and we hope to see them and their son in store many times again in the future			1
' autism spectrum disorder ( @entity113 ) is a condition that affects social interaction , communication , interests and behaviour			0
it includes asperger syndrome and childhood autism			0
children with @entity113 can display challenging behaviour , which can sometimes appear physically aggressive			0
the condition can also include behaviours like pica ( putting inedible things in the mouth ) and repetitive hand flapping , tapping or twisting			0
the world can be a confusing , isolating and daunting place for a child with autism and it is their difficulties with communication and social interaction that are often the root cause of difficult behaviour			0
the child 's behaviour is not caused by bad parenting , the @entity141 says			0
because of these difficulties , children can find it hard to communicate their needs or to understand what other people are saying to them , or asking them to do			0
children with an @entity113 may not understand ' social rules ' - the unwritten rules that govern social situations , such as how loud or quiet they must be , what behaviour is appropriate in public places , how close to stand to other people or how to take a turn in conversation			0
this is especially true if children find themselves in a new , unfamiliar situation			0
therefore , social situations or new situations can be daunting and unpredictable			0
this can cause considerable frustration and anxiety which , if it ca n't be expressed any other way may result in challenging behaviour			0

@entity9 has claimed his family has suffered ' discrimination '
after being asked to leave an @entity3 store in @entity13 because of his son
@entity3 has given the family a £ 20 voucher and is investigating their claims
but says the voucher is a ' goodwill gesture ' and not *compensation*
