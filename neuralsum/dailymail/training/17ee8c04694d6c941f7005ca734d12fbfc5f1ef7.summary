by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 01:49 est , 20 september 2013 a man 's home is his castle – especially when he ’s spent £ 100,000 lovingly transforming it from a 1960s bungalow			1
businessman @entity7 spent most of his life savings adding two extra storeys to the flat - roofed property , not to mention a turret and sweeping balconies			1
the result is a seven - bedroom home for him , his wife @entity13 and their four teenage children , worth £ 2million			1
a man could be forced to tear down £ 2 million dream seven bedroom home after he built an ' inappropriate ' extension trouble is , the council says that was n’t quite what mr @entity7 had permission to do – so it has served him with an enforcement order to demolish the house			1
mr @entity7 was granted planning permission to increase the floor space of the old house by around 45 per cent , and to build a new roof , but the council says he has far exceeded that , effectively making it a ‘ new build ’			1
he applied for retrospective planning permission for what he calls the ‘ minor adjustments ’ to the bungalow , but it was refused because the house is in the green belt and an area of outstanding natural beauty			2
@entity7 was given permission to increase the floor space of a five - bedroom bungalow ( pictured ) in @entity44 in @entity45 by 45 per cent mr @entity7 bought the 1960 's bungalow for £ 750,000 in 2008 and soon started work on an extension , which he said was agreed by local planners yesterday mr @entity7 , 45 , a director of a beauty salon , who is appealing against the decision , admitted he ‘ bent the rules slightly ’			1
but he disputes the council ’s claim that he has increased the floor space by 200 per cent and questions why it waited until the end of the 18 - month construction before ordering his new home to be razed to the ground			1
he said : ‘ the council have n’t done their homework properly before issuing an enforcement notice			2
‘ their 200 per cent figure is ridiculous			2
they have lost the plot			0
i have measured it myself and i ’ve increased it by 12 to 15 per cent			2
yes , i have bent the rules slightly			0
but i only did it to make it aesthetically more pleasing			2
the old building was dilapidated ; it was just awful			0
it was ugly and people have said it looked like a caravan site			0
but officers at @entity80 say the resulting three - storey building , complete with a turret and long balcony , amounts to a 200 per cent increase and they have refused retrospective planning permission the council has said the amount of alterations mean the house is now a totally new building and has served mr @entity7 with an enforcement order to demolish the home ‘ yes , we have made some minor adjustments , but i do n’t see the decision that has been made justifies demolishing the house			1
‘ i apologise for bending the rules , but the building has been going on for months			0
’ he bought the five - bedroom bungalow in the village of @entity44 in @entity45 for £ 750,000 in 2008 , and started work on extending it			0
called the @entity103 , it is set back 200ft from the road and approached by a winding driveway , with the nearest neighbours 20 yards away on either side			0
there have been 11 formal complaints from neighbours , who say the property ‘ clashes with other houses on the road ’ and it ‘ sticks out like a sore thumb ’			0
the parish council also says it is ‘ out of character ’ and ‘ disproportionate ’			0
but mr @entity7 countered : ‘ it does n’t overlook anyone , and you ’ve always been able to see it from the road			1
’ councillor @entity124 said : ‘ councils must follow planning law and planning regulation and this is well outside planning regulation , so we are obliged , as we are with all cases of unlawful development , to act on behalf of all our residents and issue enforcement notices			0

@entity7 given permission to increase floor space by 45 per cent
but council said changes amount to a much more *significant* increase
it *argues* alterations make it a completely different building
he has now been ordered to demolish the ' dream home '
