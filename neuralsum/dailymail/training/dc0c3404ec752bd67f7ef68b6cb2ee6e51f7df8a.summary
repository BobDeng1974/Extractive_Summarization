a tv commercial featuring the presenter on @entity3 ’s @entity2 , @entity4 , who heralded the benefits of eye correction surgery , has been banned			1
the wife of fellow tv celebrity @entity9 appeared in a commercial for an eye lens replacement treatment sold under the @entity13 brand			1
the 53 - year - old presenter said she had been able to throw away her glasses after having the treatment , which claims to restore both long and short sight			1
now the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) has banned the commercial on the grounds it was misleading			1
the @entity13 surgery is most effective for people over 50 who can not be helped by laser eye surgery			1
it involves removing the lens at the front of the eye and replacing it with a synthetic multifocal alternative			0
in theory , the surgery , which costs £ 3,495 per eye , means people can see items that are close up or far away			1
claims : but the @entity28 ( @entity44 ) has banned the commercial on the grounds it was misleading miss @entity4 was featured in the commercial saying : ‘ as a tv presenter it was so frustrating having to rely on glasses and contact lenses , but for me laser eye surgery was n't suitable			1
' then i discovered @entity13 from the eyecare experts at @entity54			1
‘ @entity13 corrects both long and short sightedness in a proven and permanent lens replacement procedure			2
ms @entity4 and her fellow morning television presenter husband @entity9 ‘ @entity13 has changed my life forever			1
goodbye glasses , hello @entity13			1
see my story at @entity61			0
’ @entity54 provided a raft of independent research and clinical evidence to demonstrate the success of advanced intra-ocular lenses ( @entity67 ) in providing near , intermediate and distance vision correction			0
it said that @entity13 represented a new category of eye surgery ‒ refractive lens exchange for those over 50 years of age ‒ which did not exist before			1
however , the eye specialist told the @entity28 that his understanding was that the multifocal lenses could not yet provide the full range of near vision correction to remove the need for glasses			1
the watchdog said it did accept that there is good evidence to believe the replacement lenses ‘ could provide sufficient correction of both long and short distance vision to the extent that many patients would no longer require glasses or contact lenses ’			2
however , it said this was not guaranteed for all patients			2
consequently , it concluded that the claims made by @entity96 and @entity54 were misleading			0
the @entity28 said : ‘ the ad must not appear again in its current form			2
we told @entity100 not to imply that all consumers who underwent the @entity13 procedure would no longer require glasses or contact lenses after the procedure if that was not the case			1
’ as a result @entity54 edited their advertisement and an amended version of it is now running			0
today @entity54 released a statement saying : ' following comments from the @entity28 , an amended version of the @entity13 advert featuring @entity4 was resubmitted , received @entity28 and industry approval , and has been broadcasting on @entity3 since 27 january			1
' @entity54 has a rigorous clinical evaluation and consenting process with all patients carried out by our expert ophthalmic surgeons			0
all risks and benefits associated with all eye surgery are made clear at the point of consultation ahead of consent			2
' the advert features @entity4 ’s personal experience as a patient			2
like the vast majority of our @entity13 patients , @entity4 achieved 20/20 vision after the @entity13 procedure , and is delighted to be free of glasses			1
the procedure is not suitable for everyone and will depend on the individual patient ’s vision and lifestyle needs			0
a @entity141 advert for @entity143 lighting has been banned an advert by @entity146 giants @entity141 has been banned for being misleading after claiming its led lightbulbs would slash £ 146 - a - year off the average household 's electricity bill			0
the ad stated the the @entity143 ( light - emitting diode ) lightbulbs would save the average householder £ 146 on their current electric bills each year - but only if they replaced 25 normal bulbs with the led bulbs			0
it stated : ' @entity159 today - save up to £ 146			0
' average household can save up to £ 146 on their lighting energy bills			0
' the direct mailing ad claimed : ' energy costs have risen over the last five years by 50 per cent , from 10p to 15p per kilowatt			0
' reduce your bills now with this brand new extensive range of led options for rooms in the home			0
' over 40 @entity143 bulb options to choose from			0
most comprehensive range of high performance led '			0
tiny text at the bottom of the ad stated : ' saving based on replacing 25 standard bulbs with @entity143 bulbs and using for an average of 2.7hrs per day for a year - based on average usage of 1,000 hours per year ( 3 hours per day ) '			0
one person complained to the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) saying they did not believe the savings and that ad was misleading and could not be proven			2
bosses at the @entity28 banned the ad , saying it was misleading - saying @entity141 had provided ' no evidence ' the average household had 25 lightbulbs , making the claims unrealistic .			2

@entity4 advertised @entity13 surgery which costs £ 3,495 per eye
