by @entity0 published : 07:33 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 07:58 est , 19 november 2013 gun - crime in the @entity2 may still be rare , but a drive around our roads reveals that it is far closer to home than you might have thought			0
in fact , hundreds of road signs are peppered with bullet - holes , rather than pellet holes , made by ammunition from illegal firearms			1
from a no stopping sign near the @entity19 in @entity20 that has been shot seven times to the @entity23 road sign near where @entity24 shot 16 people dead , many of our road signs are riddled with sinister bullet - holes - a result of gunmen using them as target practice			1
@entity30 : this no stopping sign near the @entity19 in @entity20 is riddled with what appear to be bullet - holes this shot - at sign on the @entity35 in @entity36 bears testament to the murky world of illegal firearms @entity38 found this road sign near @entity23 , where @entity24 went on a shooting spree , killing 16 people @entity41 @entity38 , 58 , who has travelled the land in search of signs that have been shot at , says there is plenty of evidence of illegal firearms if you look for it			1
he believes @entity2 's road signs are being used by killers and other criminals to test their weaponry before they unleash it on a live target			1
' i find evidence of people modifying shotguns , similar to what @entity59 did by putting weight into shotgun pellets , ' he said			0
' there are specific types of location that you find them in , and i get a gut feeling when i think i 'm in the right spot			0
' his astonishing pictures show bullet - holes in hundreds of signs across 36 counties , some of which the @entity77 veteran believe may have been put there by @entity2 's most notorious killers			1
driving through @entity80 , close to where taxi driver @entity81 murdered 12 people in june 2010 , mr @entity38 saw bullet - holes he believes were caused by @entity81			1
this sign for an army barracks has a large hole in it and is located at a busy road junction in @entity20 mr @entity38 says these holes were made by a high velocity rifle in the @entity20 countryside ' i 've found sights that i think could be linked to @entity81 ; but it 's impossible to be sure , ' he said			2
he is also convinced about the road - sign outside @entity23 , the quiet @entity95 market - town where in 1987 @entity24 shot dead 16 people including his own mother before shooting himself dead			0
before he embarked on his massacre , @entity24 told an employer he liked to go out at night to shoot at things on the road - side			0
mr @entity38 , who photographed the local road sign with bullet holes , drives thoughout the country in his job as a corporate driver , and picks routes near scenes of notorious shootings			1
' i will purposefully travel on a route that i think may have bullet holes in , ' he said , adding that @entity20 and @entity80 had particularly high numbers of signs that had been shot at			1
this is the legacy of a round from a high velocity rifle that was fired from a field into a @entity118 sign @entity41 @entity38 believes the holes are caused by would - be criminals testing their illegal firearms this sign outside the village of @entity124 in @entity125 has what looks like a bullet hole among the pelelts mr @entity38 's interest in the subject began when he saw some men shooting at a road sign in @entity133 years ago			2
' i was 300m from a small road when i saw three guys firing hand - guns at a road sign , ' he said			0
' one of them started shouting at me , then suddenly they were shooting and bullets were flying over my head			0
' this narrow escape was followed by a stint in the @entity144 , which familiarised him with guns , enabling mr @entity38 to identify what different models are being used on road signs			2
he said : ' the majority of weapons used are rifles and shotguns , not handguns so much			0
' mr @entity38 records his project on his website gunfire - graffiti , and has also written a book called @entity158 : overlooked @entity159 in the @entity2 .			2

hundreds of road signs across the country are riddled with bullet - holes
*ex-marine* @entity38 photographs them as he drives across @entity2
he believes they *'re* being used as target - practice by would - be gunmen
@entity20 and @entity80 among the counties with lots of shot road signs
