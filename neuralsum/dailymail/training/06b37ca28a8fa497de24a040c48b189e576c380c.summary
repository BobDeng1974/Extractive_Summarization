it 's the latest member of the @entity2 family designed to ease the consumer conscience			2
called @entity5 , it 's marketed as having less sugar than regular @entity7 but none of those artificial sweeteners that increasingly plague @entity11 drinkers			1
the new naturally sweetened drink - which contains a third less sugar and calories than regular cola - has been created amid calls for the company to do more to tackle the global obesity epidemic			1
sold in a green can or a recyclable bottle , it is already available in the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and is due to hit @entity27 shelves in april			1
but critics say the product - marketed as ‘ healthy ’ - may do more to improve the company ’s finances than the health of its consumers			2
a plant used for centuries by @entity49 's @entity48 , it has shot from relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large companies such as @entity2 and @entity53 in just a few years			2
currently , @entity2 @entity54 uses stevia leaf extract as a sweetener in its @entity57 and @entity58 vitamin water brands , though critics have complained it has a ' bitter aftertaste ' , similar to liquorice			1
a 330ml can of @entity5 contains 89 calories , compared to 139 calories in a regular can of @entity2			1
@entity2 ’s other products , @entity67 and @entity11 - sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame - contain around one calorie each			1
but the company is facing a growing backlash against such artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and an increased demand for natural products			0
the solution ? bring out @entity5 for the slightly more health conscious consumers out there known as ' balance - seekers '			2
@entity7 ’s @entity22 marketing director , @entity81 , has said : ‘ we know exactly who our @entity5 will appeal to			1
‘ it ’s 20 and 30 - somethings who have begun to realise they ’re not completely immortal and that they do have a sense of responsibility about what they consume			0
’ some health experts are sceptical about @entity2 ’s motives and worry about the health implications of a fizzy drink marketed in ‘ healthy ’ green packaging			1
writing for @entity94 , professor @entity95 , director of the @entity96 and @entity97 at @entity98 , said : ‘ while stevia is safe to consume , nutritionists have noted that simply removing some sugar and replacing it with stevia does n’t make a drink ( or food ) healthy			0
@entity5 has 89 calories per 330ml can and 22g of sugar			1
this is more sugar than @entity11 and @entity67 but less than ' full - fat ' regular @entity7 ' @entity7 contains 139 calories a can , and 35g of sugar , the equivalent of seven cubes @entity11 - which is sweetened with controversial sweetener aspartame contains just one calorie @entity67 is similarly calorie - free and is made with the same sweeteners as @entity11 , but has a different flavour base ‘ @entity5 still contains colouring , caffeine , phosphoric acid and 19 per cent of our recommended daily sugar intake			1
’ ‘ in fact , a cola drink with a few less calories may be part of the problem rather than the answer to reducing our waistlines			0
people tend to consume greater quantities of foods they believe to be healthy , and seeing a food promoted as healthy can lead people to eat more calories			0
’ the colour green is associated with healthiness , and so there may be a subtle reason why @entity2 decided to stray away from its iconic red - labelling with this product			2
professor @entity143 said : ‘ a recent @entity145 study found people drink less soft drink from a red - labelled cup than a blue - labelled cup			0
at a subconscious level , the colour red operates as a stop signal			0
’ when it was launched , @entity2 said that the new drink was part of its commitments to offer consumers reduced , low and no - calorie options – adding that it was the ‘ most recent example in a series of initiatives by the company to inspire happier , healthier lives ’			2
the company is a signatory to the government ’s @entity165 , under which the food and drink industry has pledged to promote and healthier diet and make changes to their products			0
@entity5 is made from a mixture of sugar and a sweetener made from an extract of @entity177 leaf , a plant used for centuries by @entity49 's @entity48 @entity2 has committed to reduce the average calories per litre in its range of sparkling drinks by 5 per cent by the end of 2014			1
but professor @entity143 is sceptical about whether introducing @entity5 is consistent with the promise to promote healthier lifestyles			0
she said : ‘ ultimately , many of these decisions are likely being made to increase the health of the companies ' profits rather than the health of their customers			0
’ a look at the @entity195 ’s 2013 financial results shows profits from regular soft drinks are declining and sales of “ healthier ” options are increasing , she added			0
she continued : ‘ perhaps the most genuine option for this and other such companies would be to cut back on the production and marketing of sweetened soft drinks and focus on selling products that are actually good for consumers .			0

@entity2 launched @entity5 this year in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25
sold in a green can , its also set to hit @entity27 shelves in april next year
it has a third less sugar than regular @entity7 and 89 calories compared to 139
sweetened with extract of stevia leaf , a plant native to @entity219
@entity177 leaf extract is 200 - 300 times sweeter than table sugar
already used in @entity57 products in the @entity22 , but critics say has an aftertaste
experts voiced concerns about the marketing of the products as healthy
warn it still contains colouring , caffeine and phosphoric acid
also still contains 19 per cent of our recommended daily sugar intake
