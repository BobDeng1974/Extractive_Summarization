on tv : @entity1 appeared on @entity2 to discuss plans for an assisted suicide law , but nobody represented the opposing view the @entity2 has been accused of bias in its coverage of assisted suicide by a campaigner whose tv appearance was cancelled at the last minute			1
a @entity13 doctor was due to oppose @entity15 peer @entity14 when he appeared on the @entity2 breakfast show to discuss his plans for an assisted dying law			1
but he was then told that he was no longer needed , and @entity14 appeared on the programme alone			2
dr @entity20 , the campaigner director of anti-euthanasia group @entity21 , has complained to the corporation after a planned appearance on the show to challenge @entity14 was called off			1
the two had previously discussed the issue on the today programme in 2012			0
in a letter sent to @entity2 director general @entity30 , seen by @entity31 , dr @entity20 said @entity32 had : ' consistently promoted an agenda seeking to change the law on assisted suicide and euthanasia '			1
he added : ' the @entity2 has consistently acted as the cheerleader for legalising assisted suicide , a move that would lead to huge pressure on the terminally ill and disabled to end their lives			2
' dr @entity20 has also claimed that the majority of medical opinion is against a change in the law to support assisted suicide			1
the @entity2 has attracted numerous complaints in recent years over the prominence it has given to ' right to die ' programmes - which are often very emotive			0

a @entity2 spokesperson said : ' assisted suicide is an emotive subject which divides opinion			2
' after much discussion within the editorial team it was felt that a single interview , in which @entity14 could be questioned fully on his views and proposals would be more suitable on this occasion			0
