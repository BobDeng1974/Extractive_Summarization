@entity0 have been here before			0
@entity1 sniffing around with their millions , looking to prize away some of @entity4 's finest talent			1
@entity5 is the latest man linked with a switch to the @entity7 , where he would follow the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 who swapped @entity13 for the @entity14 as @entity1 stormed towards @entity15 and @entity17 glory			1
the @entity19 are now ahead of @entity1 in the table and appear to be a club on the up , while the men from @entity23 must rebuild			0
and if £ 30million or more is truly on the table for @entity5 , @entity0 must consider it			1
@entity1 are considering making a move for @entity0 midfielder @entity5 this summer @entity5 has n't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against @entity29 in november @entity30 cost @entity0 £ 30m , while @entity31 splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in @entity33			1
those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season			0
and for all @entity5 's many talents , he would not be a game changer for @entity41 , or whoever @entity1 's manager may be next season			1
he was touted as a future @entity0 and @entity46 midfielder when he burst onto the scene , showing the world what he can do in a @entity51 tie against @entity52 , and possesses a technical ability which would n't see him out of place at the @entity55			2
his quick movement , superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp , driving style of play manager @entity4 likes at the @entity62 , as @entity5 's goal of the season against @entity65 last season perfectly demonstrated			1
he has been doubted on several occasions , partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch , in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23			0
the midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven - year professional career			0
he was tipped as a future @entity0 star and @entity46 international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 @entity5 is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career but even as recently as this season , @entity5 was hitting form before going off against @entity29			1
he was certainly more impressive than @entity84 and @entity85 in the @entity0 midfield , and impressed for @entity46 in a deep - lying role			2
there now seems to be little space for the @entity91 - born schemer to fit in this starting @entity92 , @entity85 , @entity30 , @entity93 , and @entity94 played behind @entity96 in the recent thumping victory over @entity98 , and that 's without the likes of @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 involved			0
of course , the ideal state of play would be for @entity4 to build a team around @entity107 , a man who is signed on for three more years , and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least			2
but @entity0 would be foolish to dismiss anything over £ 30m in today 's market , especially considering the kind of players @entity4 can now attract to the club			1
@entity5 impressed in a holding role for @entity46 in an international friendly against @entity118 last year he was in form before ankle surgery , scoring a fine goal against @entity1 in september the midfielder fired past @entity123 to score the opening goal against @entity125 last season @entity5 's effort against @entity65 was voted the 2013 - 14 @entity128 @entity0 's relationship with @entity1 , who the club have never held a firm rivalry with , could also play a part			1
any interest from fellow top - four clubs @entity31 or @entity29 would probably be dismissed immediately			0
the current @entity15 champions are looking to rebuild under @entity137 and need homegrown , young players to freshen up an ageing side			2
@entity5 is seen as a possibility along with @entity141 in midfield			2
@entity142 and @entity143 have also been linked with a summer transfer , with @entity12 and @entity145 among many names who could leave			0
but with @entity98 set to hand @entity141 the captain 's armband after @entity152 's departure , his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at @entity154			0
@entity0 fans would hate to see @entity5 go and he encapsulates the style at the @entity62			1
however , for a man who has scored five goals in his league career , and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things , it may be worth thinking about			0
@entity141 is also a possibility for @entity1 as the club look for homegrown youngsters			0

@entity1 considering bid for @entity0 midfielder @entity5
@entity141 is also an option for the @entity15 champions
@entity5 , 23 , encapsulates @entity4 's style of play in north @entity13
but the @entity46 international is not *necessarily* a first - team regular
any bids in *excess* of £ 30m should be considered by @entity0
