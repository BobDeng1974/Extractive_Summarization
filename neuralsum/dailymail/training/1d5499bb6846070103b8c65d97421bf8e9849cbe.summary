a family got a nasty surprise when they went to @entity3 ’s for a meal and were accidentally charged more than £ 6,000			1
days after a father of two was mistakenly charged £ 59,400 for four rolls of wrapping paper , @entity5 was overcharged for his @entity10 chicken – and ended up paying £ 6,235.88			1
mr @entity11 , 43 , a telecoms company director , said : ‘ we eat at @entity3 ’s all the time , but i ’ve never had anything like this			1
i did n’t really notice i was overpaying to be honest			0
’ @entity5 was overcharged by more than £ 6,000 at the restaurant in @entity16 , north @entity17 at the end of the meal , mr @entity11 asked for the bill and told the waitress he wanted to pay by card			1
he went to the till where he was presented with a bill for £ 62.35 and then told to check the amount on the chip and pin machine screen			1
but he did n’t realise the waitress had accidentally keyed in £ 6,235 – 100 times more than his actual bill			1
mr @entity11 said : ‘ i initially asked if i could put a £ 7 tip on my bill , but then my wife had some change , so i asked the waitress to cancel the card tip. during the confusion , she must have put in the wrong amount			1
just as we were leaving , the server rushed over and said there had been a mistake			2
i ’m definitely going to pay more attention in the future			0
’ while £ 6,235 is a large amount to pay at once , if mr @entity11 ’s account was in credit with this amount or more , the payment would have been approved			1
your bank can only refuse to make a payment if you do not have enough funds , if you have broken agreed terms and conditions – such as needing two signatures for a joint account payment – or if it suspects the payment is fraudulent			0
banks and card issuers use fraud screening systems to look at your spending profile and detect unusual patterns			0
things that might raise concerns include making several purchases quickly , international payments or unusually expensive transactions			2
if potential fraud is detected , the card is normally blocked			0
your bank can only refuse to refund unauthorised payments if it can prove you authorised the transaction or failed to protect your card details , or if you flag up the payment 13 months or more after it left your account			2
the blunder came as mr @entity11 visited a @entity3 ’s branch at @entity16 in @entity17 with his wife @entity78 , 43 , their seven - year - old daughter @entity80 , his niece and her husband			1
the table - of - five dined out on wings and @entity10 chicken before mr @entity11 settled the bill as a festive treat for his family on december 30			1
mr @entity11 , from @entity89 , @entity17 , added : ‘ mistakes happen and i ’m very glad they caught it before i walked away			1
’ he added : ‘ i ca n’t believe the most expensive meal of my life was at @entity3			0
it ’s good chicken , but it ’s not that good			0
’ @entity98 ’s said they were aware of the incident and are investigating			1
a spokesman for @entity98 's said : ' our staff were under the impression the customer ordered our 1992 vintage @entity106 - hence the confusion ! ' we immediately refunded the transaction and apologised for the error			1
' last week a father told of his horror when he was charged nearly £ 60,000 for wrapping paper for his children 's @entity114 presents			1
@entity116 from @entity117 complained to the @entity118 which overcharged him , but was only reimbursed following a public campaign			2
mr @entity116 , 32 , said the mistake left him unable to buy last - minute presents for his daughters @entity123 , seven , and 18 - month - old @entity124			2
the cable engineer , from @entity126 , @entity117 , said : ‘ the girl on the till was a trainee			0
when i put my card in the machine she said it had n’t worked and asked me to do it again , so i did			0
i did n’t think of it any more			0
’ the family dined on chicken wings and chips before being given the astonishing bill in @entity17 mr @entity11 's chicken meal with chips			1
the 43 - year - old said he would pay more attention to bills in the future mr @entity11 was with his wife , @entity143 ( left ) and their daughter , @entity80 ( right ) , at the time he only became aware there was a problem when his card was declined on @entity149			1
‘ i went to a cashpoint and could n’t believe my eyes when the balance came up as nearly £ 60,000 overdrawn , ’ he said			2
the money has now been refunded and mr @entity116 received apologies from @entity155 and @entity118			2
last year a teenager in @entity157 was also left massively overdrawn after he was charged £ 179,932.32 for a pizza from @entity159 ’s in @entity160			2
@entity161 , 19 , tried to pay for the £ 17.99 meal with his card			0
@entity159 ’s staff were given an authorisation code of 3232 – which was accidentally added to the price			0
when his card was declined at a supermarket , he decided to check his account			0
he said : ‘ i was massively overdrawn			0
i was terrified i might have to pay it off			0
’ @entity159 ’s and @entity169 investigated , the money was paid back two days later and a @entity169 spokesman said the bank ‘ regretted the inconvenience ’ .			0
