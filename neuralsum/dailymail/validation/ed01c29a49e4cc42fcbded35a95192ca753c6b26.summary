a decision over whether to open @entity3 ’s first ‘ new ’ grammar school in 50 years has been shelved until after the election , it emerged last night			1
the proposal for an ‘ annexe ’ to an existing grammar school in @entity8 , @entity9 , is currently being considered by the education secretary @entity10			1
she is awaiting legal advice and was expected to rule on the matter before the election			1
but last night a @entity16 source said : ‘ i do not think there ’s going to be a decision on it this side of the election			1
’ last month , the prime minister said he strongly supported the right of ' good ' schools – including grammars – to grow and if @entity27 is elected in may then the scheme would almost certainly fail to get the go - ahead			1
the @entity29 would probably need an overall majority rather than a coalition to give the plan a chance of being rubber - stamped			1
the delay will cause dismay among @entity29 backbenchers and last night threatened to overshadow an announcement the prime minister is due to make today about the government ’s flagship free schools programme			1
mr @entity41 will announce that the @entity29 will continue opening free schools – which are independent of local authority control			2
they hope to set up 500 new free schools over the next @entity46 and 270,000 new school places if re-elected			1
mr @entity41 will go on to say that 49 free schools will open in september , adding : ‘ if you vote @entity50 , you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you ’ve seen in the last three years			2
’ the proposal for a grammar school annexe comes from @entity57 in @entity58 which wants to open a campus nine miles away in @entity8			1
in 2013 the plans were rejected by the @entity61 on legal grounds			2
new grammar schools are banned , but there is backing in the @entity65 for expanding existing schools			2
and last month mr @entity41 spoke of his enthusiasm for allowing good grammar schools ‘ to expand ’ , in what was seen as an indication that he backed the new plan			2
however the issue is seen as hugely divisive , so it is believed that election chiefs want to avoid it coming up during the campaign			1
the education secretary @entity10 was preparing to give the go ahead to the new school for girls in @entity8 , @entity9 the party was previously convulsed by a row over grammars in 2007			1
at the time , mr @entity41 called them an ‘ albatross ’ , insisting there was a ‘ hopelessness ’ about calling for new grammars			2
the party ’s @entity89 spokesman @entity88 ended up resigning over the row			0
last night mr @entity88 said : ‘ this annexe is clearly wanted by local parents and by @entity94			0
' the bid has been with the department for months and there is no reason why it can not be dealt with immediately			0
’ free schools raise standards at poorly performing local schools , research has shown			0
according to think - tank @entity105 , the increased competition improves results across communities			0
@entity109 is considering a pre-election tax cut for 27million voters in the @entity112			0
it would increase the amount workers can earn before they begin paying income tax by at least £ 200			0
the income tax personal allowance of £ 10,000 is to rise to £ 10,600 in april			0
but the new increase would take thousands more people out of tax altogether and make the allowance almost £ 11,000			0
@entity123 spokesman @entity122 said : ‘ @entity109 raised vat and cut tax credits for working people , while giving millionaires a huge tax cut			0
this chancellor gives with one hand but takes much more with the other			0
’ next week ’s budget will also give details of a crackdown on loopholes used by multinationals to avoid tax			1
it could force firms such as @entity140 and @entity141 to reveal all overseas earnings .			0
