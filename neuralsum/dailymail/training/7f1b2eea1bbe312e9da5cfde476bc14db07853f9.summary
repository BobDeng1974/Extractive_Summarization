astronomers have revealed hypnotic images of swirls , loops and arches that trace the remarkable structure of our @entity7 ’s magnetic field			1
in what could rival works by @entity12 , @entity9 claims that these remarkable images are some of the first to reveal the shape of the our galaxy magnetic barrier			1
scientists hope its patterns could someday help them gaze back in time to get a clearer picture of what the universe looked like just after the @entity24			1

@entity31 shows colder areas of the magnetic field , while red shows the hotter parts to create the images , the @entity37 spacecraft tracked the sky for more than 1,500 days , mapping the direction of light in the galaxy			1
while scientists ca n’t see the magnetic fields directly , they can see how they affect light that gets sent out by tiny dust grains that sits in the magnetic field			1
one of these – polarisation – carries a wealth of information about what happened along a light ray ’s path , and can be exploited by astronomers			2
usually , these fields can vibrate at all orientations			0
however , if they happen to vibrate in certain directions , astronomers say the light is ‘ polarised ’			0
scientists hope its patterns could someday help them gaze back in time to get a clearer picture of what the universe looked like just after the @entity24			1
to create the images , the @entity37 spacecraft looked at the entire sky for over 1,500 days , mapping the direction of light in the galaxy @entity37 was launched on 14 may 2009 on an @entity73 along with @entity9 's @entity75 infrared observatory			1
the mission is designed to study the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , the relic radiation from the @entity24			2
the project , initially called @entity37 , is named in honour of the @entity81 physicist @entity80 ( 1858 – 1947 ) , who won the @entity82 in 1918			2
@entity83 february 2010 had successfully started a second all - sky survey			0
on 21 march 2013 , the mission 's all - sky map of the cosmic microwave background was released			0
at the end of its mission @entity37 was put into a heliocentric orbit and passivated to prevent it from endangering any future missions			2
the final deactivation command was sent to @entity37 in october 2013			2
by measuring the amount of polarisation in this light , astronomers can study the physical processes that caused the polarisation , including magnetism			0
if the dust grains are not symmetrical , more of that light comes out vibrating parallel to the longest axis of the grain , making the light polarised			0
the fingerprint - like swirls are echoed in a separate image , released earlier this year , which shows the first all - sky observations of ‘ polarised ’ light emitted by interstellar dust in the @entity7			2
even though the tiny dust grains are very cold , they do emit light but at very long wavelengths – from the infrared to the microwave end of the spectrum			0
if the grains are not symmetrical , more of that light comes out vibrating parallel to the longest axis of the grain , making the light polarised			0
if the orientations of a whole cloud of dust grains were random , no net polarisation would be seen			0
however , cosmic dust grains are almost always spinning rapidly , tens of millions of times per second , due to collisions with photons and rapidly moving atoms			0
then , because interstellar clouds in the @entity7 are threaded by magnetic fields , the spinning dust grains become aligned in the direction of the magnetic field			1
‘ there are still huge questions about what our galaxy 's magnetic field is , ’ said professor @entity135 from @entity137 's @entity136			1
‘ the problem is that we are sitting in our galaxy , and have to try and construct a three - dimensional view of the field , but we can only look from here on @entity150			0
‘ much of it is messy and tangled , and the information in the orientation of the light coming from the dust grains , or the electrons , gets very hard to interpret			0

the images were created using light polarisation data from the @entity37 spacecraft taken over 1,500 days
@entity9 claims that these images are some of the first to reveal the shape of the @entity7 's magnetic field
scientists says there are still ' huge questions ' about the purpose of the magnetic field and how it behaves
its patterns could help them gaze back in time to see what the universe looked like just after the @entity24
