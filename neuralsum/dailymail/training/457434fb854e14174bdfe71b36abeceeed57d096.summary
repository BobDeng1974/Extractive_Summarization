by @entity0 a relieved mother has described how a parent ’s group on @entity4 helped save her toddler 's life after her serious illness was undetected by doctors and resulted in emergency surgery			1
first - time mother @entity10 , 37 , turned to her local @entity12 ’s support group in @entity13 on the social media site after her 21 - month - old daughter @entity15 ’s ear began drastically swelling			1
she posted a photo of a red lump on her daughter ’s head on the @entity4 group and was immediately inundated by advice and support from fellow mums			1
just in time : 21 - month - old @entity15 received surgery to release the pressure that had built up in her skull just in time they urged @entity10 to rush to the hospital straight away and one even correctly diagnosed @entity15 with mastoiditis , an infection that extends to the air cells of the skull behind the ear			1
if left untreated it can spread to the brain , causing serious complications			0
' the main one that stuck in my head was from a lady called @entity45			0
she put a picture up of her daughter with the exact same condition , ' @entity10 told @entity49			2
the woman also told @entity10 her daughter was in hospital for ten days			1
doctors have now confirmed what @entity15 had was a severe case of mastoiditis			1
her daughter had an abbess and during emergency surgery they drilled into her skull to release the pressure before it spread			1
' you ca n't imagine it was horrendous , ' @entity10 said of her terrifying night in hospital			2
worrying : the swelling behind @entity15 's ear concerned her mother @entity10 so she posted this photo on @entity4 terrified : the first - time mum said she trusted her mother 's instinct and rushed her daughter straight to hospital after receiving warnings on @entity4 @entity10 had been concerned for her daughter 's health for about eight weeks , since @entity15 started day care and suffered a chest infection which she did n’t seem to get over			1
she returned to the doctors about two or three times a week with her sick child but began to feel neurotic after she was told it was usual for children to get sick after joining day care			2
when @entity15 's temperature rocked to above 40 degrees on saturday 19 july she first rushed her to hospital			1
doctors told @entity10 it was a mid-ear infection and prescribed her antibiotics which helped calm the temperature for a short while			2
@entity15 returned to day care but staff told @entity10 she still seemed ' grumpy '			2
the next day , while @entity10 was bathing her daughter , she noticed a red bump sticking out behind @entity15 ’s head and took a picture and sent it to her mother			1
inundated : @entity10 's update on @entity4 received over 600 likes from mothers in the support group ' giggling again ' : @entity10 said @entity15 , seen here after surgery , is back to her normal happy self again now hesitant : @entity10 's husband @entity99 ( left ) was n't as sure about listening to advice from @entity4 she then posted it on @entity4 and had received 60 - 70 replies within an hour , with many telling her to get her daughter to hospital immediately			1
it was 9.30pm by that point and her daughter was in bed when she received the warning			0
@entity10 's husband @entity99 was concerned about taking advice from the internet and waking @entity15 up when she was unwell			1
but @entity10 said she listened to her mother ’s instinct and rushed her daughter there as soon she received the advice			1
the family waited inside the hospital until 4am and were about to go home when a doctor came to see them			0
' because we ’d been in there for five hours , it got to four in the morning and i thought " maybe you are right "			0
we were putting our coats on and were about to leave			0
but luckily we did n’t as i ca n’t imagine what would have happened if we left , ' @entity10 said			0
restless : @entity10 waited anxiously for three hours while her daughter was in surgery long night : the family waited inside the hospital until 4am and were about to go home when a doctor finally came to see them about @entity15 the doctor apologised and said @entity15 needed surgery immediately to relieve the swelling before it reached her brain			1
a ct scan followed and they were in theatre within hours , where doctors drilled into @entity15 ’s skull to receive pressure from the swelling			2
@entity10 waited anxiously for three hours while her daughter was in surgery			2
' we had n’t slept and seeing this vulnerable little person - she is your life – and you see her wheeled off on a trolley			0
' you are frantic basically , ' @entity10 said			0
' at one point during the ct scan they rang me to say it was mastoiditis and when they operate it may affect her facial nerves and her hearing			0
they have to tell you that but it ’s so scary , ’ @entity158 have now told @entity10 she did the right thing and was just in time			2
support : worried mothers were relieved to hear @entity15 is ok ' she is my life ' : @entity10 said the could n't sleep after seeing their daughter ' wheeled off on a trolley ' relieved : @entity10 said she did n't realise how important @entity4 was at the time after getting out of surgery on wednesday , @entity10 thanked all the ‘ wonderful mummies ’ on @entity4 who advised her			1
' just wanted to give a great big shout out to all you wonderful mummies that advised me / encourage me last night			0
it ’s been an horrendous 24 hours , but my daughter had surgery today and thank the lord i went in when i did , as the surgeon said any longer about would have been much more serious			0
she is doing well and i ca n’t wait i get her well again ! you are such a wonderful group ! , ' she wrote			0
@entity10 received over 600 likes from relieved mothers and was also sent gifts by two mums who had heard about the story , including one woman who was on her hospital ward			1
@entity10 and @entity15 are now back at home and the toddler is already ' giggling again '			2
' she 's fine , we came home yesterday she ’s got a lovely scar but luckily it will be hidden by her hair			0
' she 's giggling again and happy and i guess now on reflection i know now she has n't been herself lately			0
