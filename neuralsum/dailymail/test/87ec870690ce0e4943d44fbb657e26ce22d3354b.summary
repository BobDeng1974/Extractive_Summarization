when @entity2 's season ends next month , @entity0 wo n't be jetting off on his summer holidays			1
for the moment , summer is cancelled for the defender - at least until he knows where he 'll be playing next season			0
his contract at @entity9 expires at the end of the season , when he becomes a free agent			1
the next few months will be vital in determining whether @entity13 can resurrect his once burgeoning career			2
@entity0 has found playing time hard to come by during his loan move to @entity17 side @entity2 @entity13 joined the @entity19 side after being frozen out at @entity9 - and will be on the move again this summer he knows it , too , choosing to delay any holidays until his next destination is finalised			1
likewise , he 's taken the decision to change representation , striking an agreement with @entity27 - the firm that look after @entity28			0
his season - long loan in @entity30 has n't been a disaster , but you can hardly call it an overwhelming success			0
unable to hold down a regular place in @entity36 's starting xi this season , @entity13 has had ample time to reflect on his career so far			1
tipped as the future of @entity43 's defence , @entity13 ' career has been on steady decline			1
but at the age of 26 - year - old , there 's time for @entity13 to buck that recent trend			1
@entity13 celebrates with @entity49 and @entity50 at his boyhood club , where his contract ends this year @entity53 is set on a return to the @entity55 , shown here in 2011 skipping past @entity58 's @entity57 he 's enjoyed his time in @entity17 ; he likes the lifestyle			1
but the defender is almost certain that he wants to return to the @entity55 ahead of next season			0
@entity64 manager @entity63 would sign @entity13 in a heartbeat			2
he tried , and failed , to sign him on loan in january			0
the possibility of a permanent reunion with @entity63 , who nurtured @entity13 ' career at @entity9 , this summer is a real one for the defender			1
but the drive to prove he can still be a force in @entity43 is strong			2
@entity13 has unfinished business on these shores			2
@entity13 will not be short of suitors			2
@entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 are showing an interest			0
on paper , a move for @entity13 this summer is a no brainer			1
a @entity55 winner , close to 200 top - flight appearances under his belt , still only 26 and available on a free transfer			0
the @entity89 - born 26 year old was @entity43 's first choice right - back as a youngster you do n't get many of those to the pound			1
the pound , though , is n't something @entity13 will be too concerned with this summer			1
talk to those close to the defender , they 'll tell you he simply wants to get back to playing regular football - not once every two or three weeks			0
@entity13 , who is currently nursing a slight ankle injury , wants to be a mainstay at his next club - and that will be the determining factor when he makes his decision			0
his versatility is also likely to be a major selling point			0
we know @entity13 as a right - back - but he 's developed a penchant for playing as a central defender in recent seasons			2
@entity77 boss @entity117 is willing to offer the former @entity43 man a place at the heart of his defence and it is at centre - back where @entity13 sees his long - term career			1
@entity125 understands @entity117 would be willing to offer @entity13 a slot in the heart of his defence next season in an attempt to lure him to @entity130			1
but , more than anything else , @entity13 knows he has to play			0
@entity132 will have nothing to do with his next move			0
if offered the chance of playing a peripheral role for a high - profile club or a regular position elsewhere , he 'll choose the latter			0
the sooner he makes his decision , the sooner he can get on with booking his summer holidays .			0

@entity0 ' @entity9 contract ends this summer
currently on loan at @entity2 , @entity13 wants a return to @entity43
