immigrants arrived in @entity2 at the rate of almost one every minute during the ‘ open door ’ years under @entity4 , a devastating audit reveals			1
the influx caused the foreign population to swell by 3.6million between 1997 and 2010			1
the figure was four times higher than the previous 13 years and equivalent to the population of @entity2 ’s five largest cities outside @entity11 – @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
@entity32 leader @entity31 came under attack from both the @entity34 and @entity4 after ditching his party ’s commitment to cap net immigration at 50,000			0
and @entity38 attempted to seize the initiative on the issue , ridiculing @entity40 at @entity42 ’s questions over the @entity34 ’ failure to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			0
today the spotlight switches back to @entity4 ’s own record , following the publication of a comprehensive study by the think - tank @entity50			0
it found that , through a combination of deliberate policies and ‘ cock - up ’ , 7.23million immigrants were allowed to arrive in the @entity2 – almost one every minute			1
the figure includes relatives and children who accompanied their parents – but not offspring born to parents since arrival in the @entity2			1
@entity38 attempted to seize the initiative on the immigration issue at @entity42 ’s questions yesterday over the @entity34 ’ failure to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ discounting the number who left over the same 13 - year period , net foreign immigration was 3.6million			2
however , the figure also excludes the huge numbers who are suspected of sneaking into the country illegally			2
factors behind the surge in arrivals included the relaxation of visa rules for @entity82 workers , a five-fold rise in foreign students as bogus colleges flourished and an ‘ amnesty ’ for more than 200,000 asylum seekers and illegal immigrants			1
@entity4 also made it harder for border guards to stop suspected sham marriages			0
but the most decisive factor was the party ’s decision not to impose controls in 2004 when @entity20 and seven other former @entity96 countries joined the @entity97			0
ministers predicted only 13,000 would arrive each year – yet more than one million came			2
the @entity50 study argues that the mass immigration policy had such huge implications it should have been outlined in @entity4 ’s election manifestos			0
but in 1997 the only reference was that ‘ every country must have firm control over immigration and @entity2 is no exception ’			1
the think - tank ’s report says : ‘ the new @entity4 years were characterised by a change in culture that was not shared by the wider public			1
‘ the mood at the top of government circles ... was distinctly internationalist in its outlook and viewed national borders as an increasingly archaic feature in this new globalised world			0
’ the @entity120 is blamed for stifling debate on the subject , while anyone who dared to voice their concerns risked being ‘ thought to be racist ’			2
damagingly for mr @entity38 , the analysis concludes that @entity4 may pursue similar policies if it returns to power – pointing out that the party leader forgot to mention immigration in his conference speech last year			0
@entity4 refuses to impose a target for net migration and has said it would remove foreign students from figures			2
@entity50 also points out the failure of mr @entity40 to meet his ‘ tens of thousands pledge ’ – with official figures last week showing net migration was almost 300,000 in the year to september 2014			0
@entity32 leader @entity31 came under attack from both the @entity34 and @entity4 after ditching his party ’s commitment to cap net immigration at 50,000 but it warns @entity4 is ‘ unable to capitalise on the @entity146 failure as their legacy on the issue is as close to toxic as is possible ’			0
@entity50 chairman @entity150 of @entity151 said : ‘ this is a fascinating but very sad story of how a small but determined group appear to have manipulated immigration policy while deterring any opponents with false allegations of racism			0
’ it doubted @entity4 would reduce the scale of immigration to a ‘ sensible level ’ and said pressure from pro-immigration groups would ‘ very likely lead to the gates being thrown open once more ’			2
the report by the independent think - tank says one possible explanation for @entity4 ’s policy was a desire to win future elections			0
once settled in the @entity2 , migrants were entitled to apply for citizenship and vote in general elections			1
@entity4 also decided not to strip voting rights from one million people from the @entity177 living in @entity2 who do not have citizenship			1
under arcane rules , they can register on the electoral roll as long as they have an address in @entity2			1
open borders dogma that led to anarchy through deliberate policy changes and rank incompetence , @entity4 presided over the largest wave of immigration in modern history			1
here , @entity190 examines the key decisions which brought 3.6million foreign nationals to @entity2 ... @entity193 @entity4 , unlike in almost every other major @entity195 economy , opted not to impose transitional controls when eight former @entity96 countries joined the @entity97 in 2004			1
officials predicted only 13,000 would arrive			0
what followed was one of the largest peacetime movements of people in @entity195 history			0
at the end of 2004 , there were 167,000 @entity193 in the @entity2			1
within two years the number had increased by 250,000			1
the total now stands at 1.077 million			0
under @entity4 , @entity2 developed a reputation as a soft touch for asylum seekers – with gangs massing at @entity212 to try to leap aboard lorries or @entity215 trains			1
pictured , illegal immigrants attempt to board a lorry illegal immigrant amnesty more than 220,000 failed and delayed asylum - seekers and migrants were granted permission to stay permanently from 2006 onwards in what was dubbed an effective amnesty			1
in many cases , the applicants had been stuck in the system for so long that it would have been a breach of their human right to a family life to kick them out			0
the @entity34 inherited a backlog of a further 368,100 cases from @entity4 in 2010			0
@entity233 the rules for letting @entity82 workers into the @entity2 were relaxed , allowing skilled migrants to come in without first having a job offer			2
this was a deliberate strategy designed to produce economic growth			0
in 1997 , 62,975 visas were granted to @entity82 migrants for work , plus their dependants			2
by 2005 that figure had more than doubled to at least 137,035 a year			0
@entity246 launched his prime minister ’s initiative to in 2009 to increase dramatically the number of @entity82 students - but 50,000 students were bogus bogus students in 1999 @entity246 launched his prime minister ’s initiative to increase dramatically the number of @entity82 students			1
numbers duly rocketed from 39,000 in 1997 to 180,000 a year by the time @entity4 lost power in 2010 – but little care was taken over who was coming in			2
the @entity258 found that in 2009 as many as 50,000 bogus students may have entered the @entity2 to work rather than study			1
@entity261 one of the new government ’s first acts in 1997 was to abolish a rule that placed the burden on foreign spouses to prove that it was not the primary purpose of their marriage to a @entity2 citizen or settled person to obtain residency in the @entity2			1
immediately , it led to a sharp jump in the number of marriage visas – 32,200 were given out in 1998 compared to 21,000 in 1996			2
@entity278 of exit checks in 1998 @entity4 abandoned the system of logging people out of the country			0
the report claims this is likely to have led to more people overstaying their visas and becoming illegal immigrants			1
in 1997 17,000 citizens of the @entity177 departed – this number fell to 10,000 in 1998 when the checks were scrapped			2
asylum chaos under @entity4 , @entity2 developed a reputation as a soft touch for asylum seekers – with gangs massing at @entity212 to try to leap aboard lorries or @entity215 trains			1
in 2002 almost 85,000 applications were received – up from 32,500 in 1997			0
the @entity298 introduced in 1998 made it harder to remove failed claimants .			0

during ' open door ' years of 1997 and 2001 the number of immigrants rose
population was equivalent to the population of @entity2 *'s* five largest cities
report found 7.23million immigrants were allowed to arrive in that time
@entity313 does *n't* include offspring born in @entity2 or those who entered illegally
relaxation of visas , bogus students and asylum seeker ' amnesty ' blamed
