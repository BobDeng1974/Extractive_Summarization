a midfield showdown with @entity1 and @entity2 is international rugby ’s equivalent of tackling the @entity5 , but @entity8 centre @entity6 believes he is ready to take on the @entity10 duo after a month on the side - lines			1
having not played since october because of a lat - muscle injury , @entity6 was drafted straight back into the starting xv at tuesday ’s team announcement in the @entity15 of @entity16			1
the 26 - year - old missed out on the previous tests against @entity19 and @entity20 but will start at the @entity21 on saturday , when @entity8 will attempt to end their 25 - match losing streak against the southern hemisphere giants			1
@entity6 returns to @entity8 ' starting line - up against @entity10 after a month on the sidelines @entity10 coach @entity26 has promised to field a fully loaded side in @entity28 but , despite admitting that more recovery time would have been a plus , @entity6 feels his work with the conditioners has done enough to get him up to speed to face the world ’s no 1 team			1
‘ you do n’t want to get injured when you are in the @entity8 camp because you probably get flogged more than the fit boys , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i have done a lot of fitness work , the conditioners have worked hard with me and the injury feels fine			0
' you want to put yourself up against the best and that ’s what is going to happen on saturday			0
ideally i would have had a bit more game time but that ’s how the world goes			0
’ @entity6 starts in the centres against the world champions on saturday in @entity28 @entity26 will name his starting xv on wednesday morning but the @entity51 is expected to put his faith in the centre partnership of @entity2 and @entity1 , with the latter recently completing a code switch back from rugby league			1
@entity6 , meanwhile , will be joined in the @entity58 midfield by @entity59 and their partnership must be watertight if they are going to deny the tourists yet another victory over @entity66 opposition			1
‘ i played against [ @entity1 ] away with the @entity67 at @entity68 [ in 2010 ] , but i try and forget that one , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ he ’s shown he can jump back and forth from rugby league to union and , as well as his off - loading ability , i think he ’s a very intelligent player			0
he can put passes under the line			0
it ’s important , as a midfield , we understand what each of us are doing in defence and we do n’t allow them any gaps or voids			0
‘ @entity2 is the glue that holds them together			2
he ’s outstanding in his consistency and he ’s very intelligent in attack and defence			0
he probably doesn ’ t get the plaudits he deserves because he is one of the best centres in the world			0
it ’s going to be tough but i ’m looking forward to putting myself up against him on saturday , if he plays			0
’ @entity6 is the only player named in the @entity8 line - up who did not start the opening test against @entity19			1
head coach @entity97 has kept faith in the same group of players as the @entity102 - born @entity51 bids to land a rare victory over his countrymen			1
the formidable duo of @entity2 ( left ) and @entity1 await @entity6 on his injury return @entity97 has an impressive list of achievements on his coaching resume			1
but the 51 - year - old is yet to beat the @entity10 and it is a challenge that sits near the top of his managerial bucket list			2
‘ i ’m a very proud @entity114 and i follow closely what happens over there , particularly with the other sports , ’ said @entity97			2
‘ if the @entity10 are playing someone else then i ’m cheering for them , but there ’s no one more desperate to win on saturday than me			1
my mother - in - law was asked who she ’s going to support at the weekend and she said “ @entity8 of course , because family come first ”			2
i ’m totally focussed on my role here and my dedication is 100 per cent to @entity8			2
’ equally dedicated to @entity8 is skipper @entity130 , who is back in the starting line - up after being rested against @entity20			2
the @entity132 forward has been named alongside @entity133 and @entity134 , making the @entity135 trio the most - played @entity8 back - row combination of all time			2
proud new zealander @entity97 ( right ) is aiming to tick beating his home nation off his bucket list @entity130 ( front ) rejoins the side after the captain was rested for their win over @entity20 @entity130 ’s expected opponent , @entity145 , will set a personal milestone of his own on saturday			1
the @entity148 will captain the @entity10 for the 100th time in @entity28 and @entity130 believes that , despite being in the latter stages of his career , the @entity51 flanker is still right up there with the world ’s best			0
‘ i think @entity145 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 are the best open - sides in the world at the moment , ’ said @entity130			0
‘ you relish any opportunity to come up against those guys			0
beating the @entity10 , being part of a winning @entity135 tour and winning the @entity166 are up there with the top two or three things you can do at international level ; it ’s one down and two to go ! this saturday is a great opportunity to try and tick off another box			1
’ the skipper will need to be at his inspirational best if @entity8 are finally going to crack the code			0
