by @entity0 @entity2 legend @entity1 lost vital time in the hours following his ski accident because doctors at the scene made crucial mistakes , it was claimed by a @entity9 magazine today			1
the detour his rescue helicopter made from @entity12 where he fell to a local hospital allegedly made his condition worse because the trip to a specialist unit that would have taken 20 minutes in a direct flight ended up taking an hour			1
@entity19 in @entity9 claimed the decision to take @entity1 , 45 , to a clinic at @entity22 rather than straight away to the @entity23 - where he is currently in his 109th day of a medically induced coma - was a huge mistake			1
@entity19 claims to have a medical source in @entity28 for its page one exclusive tomorrow			1
the claims are similar to those made by former @entity2 doctor @entity32 a fortnight ago			1
' too optimistic ' : a @entity9 magazine claims doctors made @entity1 's condition worse because they misdiagnosed the severity of his injuries which meant he did n't go straight to a specialist unit it claimed that doctors at the scene misdiagnosed the severity of the injuries of the motor racing giant			1
they were too ' optimistic , ' said the magazine			2
this was perhaps because @entity1 was conscious and seemed to be in full control of his senses while he was on the slope where he smashed his head on to rocks			2
but later that night he underwent two emergency operations and , at one stage , doctors did not think he would last until morning			0
' lost time always further increases the risk for the patient in such cases , ' said the magazine in a lengthy report about the accident he suffered on a ski - run on december 29 and its immediate aftermath			1
' it is recognised in medical research that every minute counts in such a serious brain injury until the proper care can be accessed and for him that is the specialised section of the @entity69 clinic			2
' it said the time taken to land in @entity22 to get the @entity2 star intubated for a ventilator ' made @entity75 condition rapidly worsen ' during the next flight to @entity69 and that such a procedure should have been carried out before the helicopter lifted off from the slopes			1
@entity1 ( pictured with wife @entity80 ) fell and cracked his head while skiing in @entity12 in december it said his condition ' dramatically and rapidly ' deteriorated on this second flight , requiring more time at @entity69 for computer scans and surgery than would otherwise have been the case			1
the @entity22 hospital says he became comatose on the flight and needed to be treated for the onward journey			2
the claims are similar to one made by mr @entity32 , the former chief doctor of @entity2 , who claimed @entity1 lost vital hours because he was airlifted to the ' wrong ' hospital			1
he said earlier this month that he believes this decision could have majorly affected his chances of recovery			0
he told @entity98 : ' you do not take patients with a suspected head injury to hospitals that do not have neuro - surgical capability			0
' @entity32 , who was @entity2 sport 's chief doctor between 2005 and 2012 , said he had learned of ' serious lapses of judgement ' in @entity1 's care and that the world is witnessing the long goodbye of motorsport 's legendary figure			0
waiting : the @entity112 , where @entity1 has been in an induced coma for three months @entity32 says he had heard from ' usually impeccable sources ' to say that these lapses ' could , and almost certainly did , worsen the outcome in @entity1 's case			0
' @entity19 also called into question the safety of helmets such as that used by @entity1 which split in two when he hit the hidden rock in snow on the fateful day of the accident			2
' for accidents like this the protection of commercially available ski helmets is not sufficient by far ' , it said			0
' many winter sports enthusiasts weigh in on false security - but a fall from a height of 75 cm can destroy a helmet that accords with @entity136 specifications			0
' at the weekend , @entity137 , his manager , told a @entity9 tv programme of the ' small steps ' he is allegedly showing as doctors battle to bring him around from the coma			0
but halfway through his fourth month in such a state , there are many medical experts in the world who think that @entity1 may be in a ' waking coma ' where he can open his eyes but do nothing else			0
the @entity28 high mountain police referred all calls to the local prefecture , where a spokesman said : ' the matter remains the subject of investigation , and it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage			0
' a @entity161 spokesman was not immediately available for comment .			0

@entity19 claims decision to take star to local hospital was mistake
alleges medics were ' too optimistic ' because he was *initially* conscious
claims time taken to get him intubated ' made condition rapidly worsen '
says procedure should have been carried out on slopes where he fell
@entity180 meant 20 - minute trip to a specialist unit ended up taking an hour
