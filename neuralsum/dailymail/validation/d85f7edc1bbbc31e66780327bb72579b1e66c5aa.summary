the thought may have occurred to @entity1 that there has never been a better time to be an @entity5 specialist			1
as the nation rakes over the debris of yet another @entity9 fiasco , the test squad named on wednesday for next month ’s three - match series in the @entity12 will be depicted as @entity15 cricket ’s chance to start the clean - up operation			1
and though the @entity18 - born @entity1 had his first taste of the big time last summer , he has not represented his adopted country since the @entity22 against @entity23 in august			1
selection for the @entity25 – for the first of 17 tests in 10 months – will almost feel like starting afresh , all over again			1
@entity1 ( centre ) is ready to battle for his @entity5 place after a mixed maiden summer in test cricket @entity1 celebrated his first @entity5 century in just his second test as he scored 127 against @entity33 @entity1 ’s quest to resume his opening partnership with @entity36 will face competition if @entity38 is deemed ready to resume his @entity5 career following his stress - related condition			1
but the prize is glittering on the horizon : the chance to help win back the @entity44 this summer			2
‘ to play in an @entity44 series would be massive for me , ’ @entity1 told @entity45			1
‘ i ’d be lying if i said i was n’t super keen			0
but there are five tests before then , and i ’m hoping first and foremost to play in them			2
’ @entity1 ’s first challenge will be to quell the chatter about his technique and nail the only spot in the test batting line - up that remains up for grabs			1
after scoring a composed century in only his second game for @entity5 , against @entity33 at @entity57 , he began the series against @entity23 with a steady 59 at @entity59			1
six more test innings brought him a top score of 37			2
and , as one of the few batsmen not to cash in against a mediocre @entity66 attack , he repeatedly found himself on the wrong end of the pundits ’ analysis			0
but @entity1 's judgement outside off stump has been questioned after dismissals caught behind and bowled @entity1 tucks into the @entity66 bowling at @entity59 last july , but failed to notch a ton against the tourists @entity76 tests : 7 innings : 11 runs : 336 batting average : 30.54 hundreds : 1 fifties : 1 top score : 127 ( vs @entity33 ) @entity84 tests : 49 innings : 87 runs : 3763 batting average : 46.45 hundreds : 9 fifties : 18 top score : 226 ( vs @entity92 ) last summer , he was caught in the cordon five times , bowled four times and lbw twice			1
experts made a simple diagnosis : @entity1 had a flaw around off stump			1
‘ it is something i ’m conscious of , ’ he said			0
‘ knowing where your off stump is as an opening batsman is crucial			1
i ’ve worked on it just as i ’ve worked on other areas of my game			0
but i ’m not walking out there expecting never to nick another one			0
‘ i was a little bit disappointed not to get another big score last summer after i ’d set myself a good base			2
but i still look back with pride on the 3 - 1 series win against @entity23 , and the @entity116 was something which made me feel comfortable with the environment			1
‘ there was a very welcoming culture in the dressing - room , which helped all the young guys coming in			2
after the disappointing loss to @entity33 , that helped us turn things round pretty quickly			0
i ’m hungry if i get another chance to score some big runs			0
’ while many of the colleagues he hopes to team up with in the @entity12 have spent the last few months confirming @entity5 ’s traditional struggle with 50 - over cricket , @entity1 has been assiduously working on his game in @entity132 with the @entity134 ’s performance programme and the @entity135			1
and he reserves special praise for the coaching of @entity138 and @entity139			0
‘ i ’ve always been someone who likes to hear as many views as possible , especially from guys who have played lots of @entity130 , and then apply it to my own game , ’ he said			0
‘ in the end you ’ve got to work things out for yourself			0
@entity38 could be ready to resume his @entity5 career , which would pile pressure on @entity1 's place the 25 - year - old opener has been able to learn from @entity153 and @entity154 at @entity155 ‘ @entity138 talks a lot about your approach to batting – how to score runs , as opposed to just technique			1
if he notices something technical , he ’ll say it			0
but he does n’t just say stuff for the sake of it			0
he likes to keep things simple			0
they spot things , but they do n’t go on and on			0
’ only 25 , @entity1 has already been privileged to open with @entity153 and @entity169 ’s @entity154 at @entity155 , as well as @entity36 last summer – that ’s 50 test centuries ’ worth of experience to learn from at the other end			1
‘ my game ’s in good order , ’ said @entity1 , who is currently in @entity174 for a spot of pre-season training with @entity155			2
‘ i ’ve had enough cricket over the winter to work on it , and i feel refreshed			0
i feel ready to go and really hopeful of getting picked in the squad			2
i just want to get out there and do the job			0
