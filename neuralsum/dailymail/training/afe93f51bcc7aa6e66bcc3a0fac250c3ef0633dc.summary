@entity0 , the second nurse to be diagnosed with @entity1 , had a lo - grade fever and boarded a flight from @entity4 , @entity5 , to @entity6 , anyway - just hours before she was hospitalized with the deadly disease			1
now , @entity9 officials are trying to track down all 132 passengers who were aboard @entity11 on monday with ms @entity0 over fears they could all have been exposed to the virus			1
ms @entity0 traveled home to @entity5 to plan her wedding and visit her mother last friday , despite being one of the 76 medical workers from @entity19 under observation by the @entity9			1
she had treated @entity21 , the @entity1 ' patient zero			1
' health officials say she was told she was at risk for exposure to the disease but flew on a commercial airline anyway			2
everyone who was on board the plane is urged to call 1 - 800 - @entity9 - info ( 1 - 800 - 232 - 4636 ) so that they can be interviewed by @entity9 doctors to determine who is at risk for possible exposure to @entity1			1
she had a fever of 99.5 degrees , but boarded a plane from @entity4 to @entity6 , anyway protecting themselves : @entity38 workers at @entity50 wore latex gloves on wednesday after it was revealed an @entity1 - infected nurse flew out of the airport on monday night ms @entity0 is currently in stable condition at @entity56 , though doctors are preparing to transfer her to an infectious disease ward at @entity59 in @entity43			1
she flew home to her family in @entity5 on friday , despite @entity9 advice that says people being monitored for @entity1 should stay away from public transportation , officials said			1
' she should not have traveled on a commercial airline , ' @entity9 director dr @entity66 said in a news conference today			1
dr @entity66 , however , did not say whether she was told not to travel by @entity9 officials			1
ms vinson was on @entity71 returning to @entity6 just hours before reporting the first symptoms of @entity1			1
' because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning , @entity9 is reaching out to passengers , ' the agency said in a statement			2
she had a fever of 99.5 degrees , though patients are told not to be concerned about @entity1 symptoms until the fever reached 101.5 degrees			2
patients infected with @entity1 are not contagious until after they begin to show symptoms - which can take anywhere from two days to three weeks			2
public health officials are concerned that ms @entity0 may have been contagious on the flight			1
flight 1143 took off from @entity50 about 6.30pm eastern time on monday and landed shortly after 8pm at @entity90			2
the next morning , she showed up to @entity19 with a fever			1
she was isolated and tested for @entity1			2
positive test results came back today			0
@entity38 said it is disinfecting the plane that carried ms @entity0 and has removed it from service - though not before it made four more flights around the country the plane ms @entity0 flew on when she may have been contagious made four more flights full of passengers before it was removed from service			1

the plane that carried ms @entity0 has been removed from service and disinfected twice			1
however , it made five more flights with passengers before the @entity9 notified @entity38 of the possible @entity1 exposure			1
on tuesday morning , the plane , an @entity125 , took off from @entity6 and returned to @entity4			1
it then flew to @entity127 then back to @entity4			0
then @entity4 to @entity43 's @entity105 , the busiest airport in the world , and back to @entity5			2

the @entity9 has not said anyone on those flights is at risk of catching the virus and has emphasized that ' the risk is very low ' even for the passengers on the @entity38 flight			2
when is @entity146 ? only when someone is showing symptoms , which can start with vague symptoms including a fever , flu - like body aches and abdominal pain , and then vomiting and diarrhea			0
@entity155 ? through close contact with a symptomatic person 's bodily fluids , such as blood , sweat , vomit , feces , urine , saliva or semen			0
those fluids must have an entry point , like a cut or scrape or someone touching the nose , mouth or eyes with contaminated hands , or being splashed			0
that 's why health care workers wear protective gloves and other equipment			0
the @entity179 says blood , feces and vomit are the most infectious fluids , while the virus is found in saliva mostly once patients are severely ill and the whole live virus has never been culled from sweat			0
the @entity189 said sunday that a health - care worker who provided hospital care for the first patient to die from @entity1 in the @entity194 has tested positive for the virus			2
the worker was not identified and it was unclear what level of care the worker provided or when the health worker came into contact with the patient			0
it is the first known case of @entity1 being transmitted in the @entity194 what about more casual contact ? @entity1 is n't airborne			0
dr. @entity66 , director of the @entity9 , said people do n't get exposed by sitting next to someone on the bus			1
' this is not like flu			0
it 's not like measles , not like the common cold			0
it 's not as spreadable , it 's not as infectious as those conditions , ' he added			0
@entity179 gets tested when @entity146 is suspected ? hospitals with a suspected case call their health department or the @entity9 to go through a checklist to determine the person 's level of risk			0
among the questions are whether the person reports a risky contact with a known @entity1 patient , how sick they are and whether an alternative diagnosis is more likely			1
most initially suspicious cases in the @entity194 have n't met the criteria for testing			0
how is it cleaned up ? the @entity9 says bleach and other hospital disinfectants kill @entity1			1
dried virus on surfaces survives only for several hours			0
the ebola virus has survived on surfaces for up to six days in lab experiments , though most studies suggest it can on live a few hours			0

both women are at @entity19 in @entity6 , which treated @entity21 as well			1
