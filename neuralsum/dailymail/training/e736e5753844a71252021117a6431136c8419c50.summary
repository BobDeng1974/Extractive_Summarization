by @entity0 when it comes to calling the police , most children could tell you that all it takes is to pick up the phone and dial			2
but it seems the system confused one caller to @entity10 , who phoned the 999 emergency number to ask how to call the non-emergency 101 line			1
in a recording of the call , the man can be heard asking if he needs to put the @entity18 area code 0121 before the number , or press the hash key afterwards			1
scroll down for audio @entity10 have released a recording of a man phoning 999 to ask how to dial 101			1
in the clip , he can be heard asking whether he needs to put the @entity18 area code in front of the number on tuesday evening the force tweeted from its @ @entity31 account : ' unbelievable - this sound clip is taken from an actual 999 call			1
' in it , the man who dialed 999 asks how to call 101			2
note to caller in clip ... to dial our non-emergency 101 number you pick up the phone and press 1 then 0 then 1			1
' please remember that 999 should be used for genuine emergencies only			0
for non-emegency calls and enquiries , please dial 101			1
' yesterday chief superintendent @entity46 , head of the force ’s @entity47 , warned time - wasters that their calls could cost lives			0
he added : ' typically @entity10 receive over 1500 calls a day to the 999 number and our operatives have to deal with each one accordingly			2
' of these , some 10 to 20 per cent are not police matters and around 50 per cent are non-emergency calls where contact is appropriate via the 101 number			1
the force released the clip yesterday in order to shame the time - waster , saying hoax calls put lives at risk ' as well as the bizarre calls police also receive deliberate hoax calls which take up vital time			2
it ’s astonishing listening to them but they hide a serious truth			0
' each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but , if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency , then a minute is a very long time to wait			0
' i can not stress enough that the 999 number is for emergencies only , for guidance this is defined as : a crime is in progress , someone suspected of a crime is nearby , when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened			2
' we do not want to discourage people from contacting the police so for any other reason call 101			0
' it was the latest in a string of bizarre to the 999 services across the @entity99 in recent months			0
a @entity99 officer said around 20 per cent of calls to their emergency number are not about police matters , and 50 per cent should be directed to 101 ( stock image ) earlier this month the force had a call from a homeowner who wanted to report a rat in her kitchen			1
and last year police released a recording of a man who dialled police to complain about a prostitute 's looks after meeting her outside a hotel			0
the caller dialled 999 and told operators he ' wished to report her for breaching the @entity121 '			0
almost half of the 700,000 telephone calls received by the force ’s emergency number were inappropriate .			0

man called @entity10 999 line to ask how to dial 101 number
wanted to know whether he needed to put @entity18 area code first
earlier this month police were called by *woman* to report rat in her kitchen
