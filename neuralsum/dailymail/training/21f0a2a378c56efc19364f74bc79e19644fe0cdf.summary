by @entity0 for @entity1 with high - profile campaigns for @entity4 and @entity5 under her belt , @entity2 is one of today ’s top models			1
however , the 28 - year - old from @entity9 , has n't had a straight trajectory to success			0
her career began with drastic dieting , followed by years of anorexia - all in an effort to obtain the correct model proportions			1
it was only when she re-gained weight and entered the world of plus - size fashion that she truly found success			2
speaking to the @entity22 , @entity2 explains why she decided to write ' hungry ' , which details her own battles with anorexia and her journey to body acceptance , she says she wanted to encourage ‘ people to question preconceived notions about what it means to be beautiful and the dangerous lengths some are willing to go to attain this			1
‘ i wanted to tell the story of my life up until this point which included many tribulations to overcome , ’ @entity48 told the @entity22			2
‘ i had an unquenchable need to succeed at such a young age , to make something out of myself and to experience the world			2
i know i used to have warped thinking but i changed and i wanted to help others change too			0
‘ evolving my mindset opened me up to an entire world of possibilities and a peace that i had not previously known			0
so i felt i had to pass it on			0
’ @entity2 walks the runway as the @entity65 by @entity66 spring 2011 collection @entity2 's story is particularly positive because , as well as recovering from her eating disorder she found success once she had reached a more healthy weight considering her time as a ‘ normal size ’ model was spent in misery , starving herself and frantically exercise to maintain her size 0 - 2 figure , it is little surprise that @entity2 says the worst thing about modelling is ‘ the lack of control ’			1
@entity2 ’s story is particularly positive because , as well as recovering - beginning to eat again after realising she would die if she continued to starve herself - she found success once she had reached a more healthy weight			0
after years of anorexia , she regained the near 5st ( 32kg ) she had lost			1
at a @entity89 size 12 ( @entity91 size 16 ) , @entity2 is hardly massive , but her beauty and presence have made her the go - to plus size model for high end designers			0
having since fronted the @entity98 2010 @entity97 campaign as well as appearing in campaigns for @entity37 , @entity100 , @entity66 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , @entity2 is now developing a love of being behind , as well as in front , of the camera			1
‘ a love of images had brought me into modelling , and from there i think it was natural that i picked up a camera			0
