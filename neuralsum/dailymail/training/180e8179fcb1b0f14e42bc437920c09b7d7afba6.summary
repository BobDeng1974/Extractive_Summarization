@entity0 , the coach of @entity1 , took a leaf out of sir @entity4 ’s book of football management when he appealed for @entity6 to referee strongly and ' clamp down on things ' in the @entity8 semi-final with @entity10			1
@entity0 claimed that the refereeing standards in @entity13 football are better in a clear attempt to influence the @entity16 referee			1
@entity6 is another referee who was known as a strict disciplinarian before this competition , but he has opted for a liberal approach at the finals			1
however , low , like the majority of observers , will have thought that appeal fruitless to a committee who deny having instructed the officials to take a low - key approach and to let the players take centre stage			2
perhaps the wording is inaccurate as @entity39 can not ' instruct ' on application of law but they can suggest and guide – and inference plays a huge part in such finals competitions			0
it is impossible to conclude otherwise when the strictest of referees currently on the world circuit , @entity65 , waits for 40 free - kicks before he issues a single yellow card			0
appointment : @entity6 missed @entity70 's bite on @entity71 but will take charge of semi-final seeing red : @entity6 sent off @entity76 's @entity75 in the same match @entity79 coach @entity78 was quoted as saying that he wanted @entity10 to ' toughen up ' and rough - up opponents , and their performances against both @entity82 and @entity83 have delivered on his wishes			1
these two powerhouses in world football have only faced each other once before in this tournament , the 2002 final which was refereed by the peerless @entity91 @entity90			0
@entity6 really does n’t bear comparison to the superb @entity90 and will be well aware of the issues of handling such a huge game			1
however , @entity6 does not lack confidence and was understandably absolved of any blame when missing @entity70 ’ bite on in @entity76 ’s @entity71			1
the big question before the match is : will @entity39 continue with their desire to allow players to commit almost countless fouls before being cautioned or will they expect the referees to afford the skilful players the protection they deserve ? @entity6 will know he can not win as @entity0 ’s statement makes it clear that @entity1 want a change in approach whilst @entity10 are benefiting from the leniency afforded them through the tournament so far			2
@entity39 , in attempting to make this a tournament in which the match officials are unnoticed , have failed and run the risk of allowing the dark arts to win out			0
in the last final they were fortunate that @entity119 had enough skill to defeat the @entity121 despite their over-physical approach			0
this time they might not be so lucky and more of the @entity125 ’s top players could just get hurt			0
@entity126 to shine in @entity128 's adsence - @entity127			2

@entity16 @entity6 will take charge of *tuesday* 's semi-final
@entity35 boss low has called on him to ' clamp down ' on any *over-zealous* *challenges*
@entity6 is the referee who missed @entity70 's bite on @entity71
