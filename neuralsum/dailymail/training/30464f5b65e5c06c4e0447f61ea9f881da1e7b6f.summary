by @entity0 an emotional father has described the unimaginable moment he watched his 16 - year - old daughter plunge 3,500ft to the ground after a skydiving accident saturday			1
' i did n't know until i got to her and saw the body on the ground ( that ) it was her , ' @entity6 said of his daughter , @entity13 , in a tuesday press conference			1
' the whole way over there , from the time that i knew ( the skydiver was ) going to hit the ground ... it was " please @entity15 , do n't be @entity13 , please please please @entity15 , do n't be @entity13			1
' miraculously , the @entity24 , @entity23 , teen survived the horror fall , baffling doctors at the @entity27 where she has now been moved out of intensive care			1
' i was n't there , but if she truly fell 3,500ft i have no idea how she survived , ' @entity50 , the @entity27 trauma surgeon who treated @entity13 , said in the news conference			1
' when i saw her in the emergency department , i would have predicted she was not going to survive all of this			0
but i 'm always happy to be wrong about these things			0
' within 12 hours of arriving at @entity27 medical , @entity13 's internal bleeding had stabilized and she began regaining consciousness , @entity50 said			1
she is expected to be fully recovered after six to eight weeks of rehabilitation			0
@entity13 's parents have slammed the skydiving company , @entity64 , for failing to properly train their daughter ahead of the jump , and claim they offered her only a solo jump rather than tandem with an instructor			1
' she was n't prepared , ' @entity6 said			1
' we were n't walked through the steps for the malfunction that did take place , at all			2
' miracle : doctors in @entity76 are baffled at how 16 - year - old @entity77 , pictured , survived plunging 3,500ft to the ground after her parachute did n't open properly saturday alive : @entity77 , 16 , fell approximately 3,500 feet to the ground when her parachute apparently malfunctioned confusion : @entity6 , pictured here with his daughter , expected @entity13 to jump tandem with an instructor but he said the company made her go solo he added in the news conference : ' i do n't think she should have been allowed to go up there and i find it very hard to believe the rules and regulations in @entity76 are that lax			1
i think it is the company ... ' @entity6 drove to @entity64 in @entity96 , @entity76 for the jump after @entity13 said it was her dream to go skydiving on her 16th birthday			1
in @entity23 , the legal age to sky - dive is 18 but @entity76 allows 16 - year - olds to jump with parental permission			1
@entity6 , who was also in the airplane , successfully jumped before watching from the ground as his daughter tumbled through the air and landed with a thud			1
' she was screaming real bad and acting like she had the wind knocked out of her , wheezing , ' the emotional father recalled			0
' then she started screaming , " get off me , get off me , " and nobody was on her			0
then she told me to rub her back and she 'd start screaming real loud			0
' emergency crews arrived in 15 minutes and began administering aid			0
shocked : ' i was n't there , but if she truly fell 3,500ft i have no idea how she survived , ' @entity50 , the @entity27 trauma surgeon who treated @entity13 , said in a news conference tuesday @entity64 owner @entity120 said @entity13 and her father went through about six hours of training before they jumped , which is standard for new jumpers at @entity64			1
but @entity6 said it was closer to two or three hours			1
according to its website , the registered company requires four hours of training for first - time static line jumpers			2
during training , @entity120 said jumpers are taught how to respond in emergency situations and deploy backup chutes			2
as @entity13 was falling , a radio operator on the ground instructed her to deploy her backup chute , but she did n't do it			1
her parents , who are considering a lawsuit , said she was n't trained properly to respond to the emergency situation mid-air and she was n't strong enough to deploy the second parachute			1
they also suspect her equipment may have been faulty			0
according to @entity120 , who was in the plane with the father and daughter , @entity13 's chute opened fully but took a left turn after opening and spiraled to the ground			1
not so sweet : @entity13 was with her dad @entity149 , who took her to @entity76 to skydive for her 16th birthday excited : in most places and in @entity23 where the @entity153 live , you must be 18 - years - old to skydive			1
to get around the rule , the father and daughter drove to @entity76 , where 16 - year - old @entity13 could jump with her father 's consent ' all i 'm going to say is it had a bit of a turn , and it was n't corrected , the 46 - year skydiving veteran said			1
' it probably could have been corrected			0
' meanwhile , her father described his daughter as the ' toughest kid i ever met			2
' ' she never shed one tear , ' he told reporters			0
@entity13 's mother , @entity173 , said she was talked into signing the permission slip because she thought her daughter would be jumping tandem			1
' they talked me into it because of course they said it was safe , she 'd be on somebody 's back , it was n't going to be her responsiblity to do anything , so i did give her permission because she was very excited , ' she recalled through tears			2
' @entity15 's hand caught her , ' @entity13 's older sister @entity190 told @entity192 earlier this week			1
things looked grim after the jump but the teen exuded joy and excitement beforehand			2
@entity13 and her father were there to fulfill her dream to go skydiving			2
' you can be 16 with a parent consent			0
my dad is jumping with me , ' @entity13 tweeted leading up to her perilous fall			1
' she 's still alive and really she should n't be ' : @entity13 's sister @entity190 ( right with @entity13 at left ) says her sister 's survival is nothing short of a miracle it was one of many ecstatic dispatches she 'd send out friday			1
@entity13 's dad jumped first and @entity13 followed thereafter			2
another man decided he did n't want to do it and the instructor stayed behind			2
@entity6 landed safely on the ground and watched helplessly as his daughter spiraled down , her parachute apparently jammed			1
' my dad said that the guy on the ground was talking to [ my sister ] through the radio , ' @entity190 told @entity227			2
' they had a radio in their ears			0
and my dad just heard him keep saying , " reach up			0
you need to calm down , calm down			0
" ' the family believes @entity13 must have panicked and it kept her from fixing her chute or engaging the backup			1
she was rushed to an @entity239 hospital			0
' her vertebrae broke in half , ' @entity190 said			0
' her pelvic bone completely split in half			0
she has more broken bones in her back			0
she has two broken ribsâ € ¦ her teeth			0
' survivor : according to @entity190 , @entity13 has several broken vertebrae , a shattered pelvis , smashed teeth and serious internal bleeding			2
she was on a breathing machine , but miraculously she was breathing on her own after two days @entity13 also had serious internal injuries including bleeding in her brain , lungs and liver according to a @entity257 account the family set up to keep loved ones updated on @entity13 's well - being			1
she was on a breathing machine at first			0
but miraculously , after two days , she improved enough to start breathing on her own			0
@entity190 says her sister is able to wiggle her toes and can even speak a little			0
' she honestly keeps saying is , she just thinks it was her fault , because she could n't reach up and pull the shoot , ' said @entity190			0
who 's fault it is remained unclear monday			0
@entity13 jumped with her father 's consent , but more often than not a jumper 's first skydive is done tandem -- that is , while strapped to the back of a more seasoned jumper			2
this is what her father expected to happen , however , @entity275 only offered solo jumps			0
but @entity13 is now focused on her recovery			2
' the whole thing that 's keeping us going is because she 's still alive and really she should n't be , ' @entity190 said .			0

' the whole way over there , from the time that i knew ( the skydiver was ) going to hit the ground ... it was " please @entity15 , do n't be @entity13 , " ... and it was , ' @entity6 , from @entity24 , @entity23 , said tuesday of his daughter
miraculously , @entity13 survived the horror fall , baffling doctors at the @entity27 where she has now been moved out of intensive care
the family are now *accusing* @entity64 in @entity297 , as @entity76 for failing to *adequately* train @entity13 for a solo jump
she was injured after she had a *complication* with her parachute during a jump saturday and was unable to open a backup chute
