it was a farce that would lead to a goalkeeper given a red card , a team red with anger ... and the @entity6 @entity5 red - faced after reversing the ref 's decision			1
the trouble began when a drunk hooligan ran on to the field to attack @entity13 's @entity12 during the first half of their @entity16 match with former @entity18 champions @entity17 at the @entity19 last night			1
to everyone 's surprise , @entity21 goalie @entity20 then launched a kung fu kick at the teenage thug , sending him crashing to the floor - and landed a few more kicks before security guards dragged the invader away			2
and when referee @entity31 red - carded the goalkeeper , @entity13 coach @entity30 ordered his side to walk off in protest			1
now , however , the red card has been rescinded by the @entity6 @entity5 ( @entity36 )			2
' at the time , @entity31 said : ' i understand that @entity20 was defending himself , but he walked to him ( the supporter ) and kicked him multiple times			2
he could also have walked away			0
' @entity17 were leading the round - of - 16 match 1 - 0 after a goal by @entity56 when the incident happened 36 minutes in			0

@entity36 director @entity74 said his organisation was considering the incident , but is not certain whether or not the game will be replayed			0
@entity17 coach @entity78 , a renowned former defender for the @entity36 ' national team , said of @entity20 's reaction : ' maybe i would have done the same thing , maybe not			2
but emotionally i do understand it			0
' chaos : @entity13 players protest after referee @entity31 red carded their goalkeeper you 're coming with us : the pitch invader is led away by security staff after disrupting @entity17 against @entity13 it is not the first time a player has attacked a fan			1

@entity96 was fined Â£ 20,000 , banned for nine months and stripped of his @entity104 captaincy after the incident			0
