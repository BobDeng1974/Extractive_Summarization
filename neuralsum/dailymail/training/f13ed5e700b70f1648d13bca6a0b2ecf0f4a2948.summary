by @entity0 published : 17:29 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 19:56 est , 8 october 2012 bungling air traffic controllers misunderstood a piece of aircraft jargon which could have prevented a 122mph mid-air collision that killed five people , an inquest heard today			1
pilot @entity7 , 70 , was killed when his kit - built @entity9 - 2 one - seater aircraft crashed into a twin - engine @entity12 plane 700ft above @entity14 four years ago in august 2008			1
@entity15 , 28 - the pilot of the @entity12 , codenamed @entity16 - and her three colleagues , @entity18 , 28 , @entity19 , 34 , and @entity20 , 33 , also died			1
died in crash : pilot @entity7 ( left ) , 70 , was killed when his kit - built @entity9 - 2 one - seater aircraft crashed into a twin - engine @entity12 plane - carrying four people , including @entity20 , 33 ( right ) killed : @entity18 ( left ) , 28 , and @entity19 ( right ) , 34 , were also on the @entity12 which crashed the @entity12 , which belonged to aerial survey company @entity29 , was conducting a routine training flight at the time , an inquest at @entity28 heard			1
the night before the crash the company told air traffic controllers they would be flying at high speed into the airport as part of an exercise to train pilots how to land in bad weather			0
but controllers allegedly failed to understand that the terminology for the exercise - @entity46 calibration work - meant the plane would be flying at low levels into the airport			1
the training requires pilots to fly at 122mph towards the runway before suddenly pulling up at 50ft and flying away			0
@entity52 , a senior inspector at the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , said : ‘ air traffic control was unaware of the nature of g - eyes 's flight			2
‘ the company told air traffic control the night before they were going to be doing @entity46 calibration work but the person who took the message did n’t know what that meant			0
investigation : aerial photograph showing the scene after five people were killed in a mid-air collision near @entity69 in @entity70 in august 2008 ‘ they ticked the box “ @entity73 ” which would mean it would be likely to be flying normal speeds			1
the full implication of g - eyes 's fast speed was not considered			2
’ ' the company told air traffic control the night before they were going to be doing @entity46 calibration work but the person who took the message did n’t know what that meant ' @entity52 , @entity53 the @entity12 was cleared to approach to land third in sequence behind mr @entity7 ’s plane , code named @entity87 , the court heard			1
mr @entity52 said radar controllers at @entity14 instructed mr @entity7 to alter his flight path when they realised the two planes were on a collision course			1
but tragically the two aircraft crashed seconds after air traffic control informed the @entity12 about mr @entity7 ’s altered plans			1
the inspector said he believed the planes collided at 122mph and it was possible mr @entity7 ’s small plane would only have been visible from the @entity12 for seven to 19 seconds before the crash			1
prior notice : the night before the crash the company told air traffic controllers they would be flying at high speed into the airport as part of an exercise to train pilots how to land in bad weather air traffic controllers allegedly failed to tell mr @entity7 where the @entity12 was in relation to his plane			1
' air traffic control must pass sufficient information to pilots to enable them to avoid collision			0
if pilots are alerted to the presence of an aircraft then they are eight times more likely to see it ' @entity52 mr @entity52 added : ‘ the “ see and avoid ” principle was compromised by the constant relative bearing between the aircraft , the small size of @entity127 and the fast speed of g - eyes			2
‘ the majority of her attention was probably directed inside the cockpit			0
the pilot in the right - hand seat was the safety pilot and @entity87 would have been obstructed from that right - hand pilot			2
‘ air traffic control must pass sufficient information to pilots to enable them to avoid collision			0
if pilots are alerted to the presence of an aircraft then they are eight times more likely to see it			0
investigation : the first plane came down here - near @entity69 , @entity146 , five miles from @entity14			1
the second aircraft crashed in nearby @entity148 ‘ no information was given to the pilot of @entity87 ( mr @entity7 ) regarding the presence of g - eyes			1
and ambiguous information was given to the pilot of g - eyes ( miss @entity16 ) regarding the presence of @entity87			2
’ coroner @entity156 said : ‘ we are looking into the deaths of five people			0
five people died when two aircraft collided in mid-air			2
it was august 17 , 2008			0
‘ mr @entity7 was in his own aircraft on his own			1
the other aircraft had everyone else in			0
the two women were sitting in the front and the two men were in the back seats			0
‘ the purpose of their flight was to carry out flight calibration training			0
around 10.36am they both were approaching the runway at @entity14			2
in mid-air they collided and the five people all died			0
’ the inquest is expected to last for a week .			0
