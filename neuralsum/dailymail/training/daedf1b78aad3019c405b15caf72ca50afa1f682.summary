@entity0 caused outrage yesterday over plans to kill a pied wagtail which has been fluttering round one of its supermarkets - but backtracked when a @entity8 wildlife presenter intervened			1
the seven inch tall female pied wagtail has ' delighted ' customers by flying around the aisles since it fluttered into a @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 several weeks ago			1
staff have tried in vain to get it outside by laying down traps , using nets , opening windows and have even attempted to lure it out with food			0
store bosses took the drastic step of seeking permission to have it shot over fears that it poses a health and safety risk			1
the conservation body @entity36 granted a licence allowing @entity0 to bring in a professional sniper to shoot and kill the small bird on the grounds of ' protecting public health '			1
but @entity0 faced a storm of protest after a local newspaper revealed that the bird faced being gunned down			1
@entity46 , 28 , of @entity47 near @entity13 , who shops at the store , led a social media campaign on @entity51 to save the bird			1
she said : ' it made me very upset and i felt i needed to try and do something so i re-tweeted the story and tweeted as many people and companies as i could			0
' i did n't want a riot outside @entity0 but i felt that there was someone out there that had the skills to catch this bird without killing it			1
' after she launched the campaign , @entity8 wildlife presenter @entity67 , 53 , who has presented nature programme @entity68 since 2009 then became involved and demanded that the bird be spared			1
he tweeted a message to @entity0 , saying : ' can i ask you to rethink the shooting of the wagtail in @entity77 please			1
i 'm sure the bird could be caught			0
' @entity79 replied in a tweet , saying : ' we 've tried for a number of weeks to catch the bird , definitely our preference to catch and release			1
' customers and local residents also took to local newspaper websites to vent their anger at the decision			0
@entity92 wrote : ' pity you ca n't bring in marksmen / women to take out a few hundred seagulls instead of a rare beautiful bird like this			2
shame on you tesco 's ! ' another shopper said : ' we live in a rural area , the occasional bird dropping in or amongst our food is not that unusual			0
just wash it off for goodness sake			0
but no , there 's profit at stake here so a knuckle dragging ott response is deemed necessary			0
it 's @entity113 for me and my family from now on			0
' the bird is believed to be roosting around the store 's café and is thought to be surviving on crumbs on the floor instead of its usual diet of insects			2
pied wagtails are birds protected under the 1981 @entity126			0
as a protected bird , anyone who kills one could be fined up to £ 5,000 or jailed for a maximum of six months if they do not have a licence			2
as the store is open for 24 hours a day , the bird was going to be shot on a sunday when the store is closed between 10am and 4pm			2
mr @entity67 then put @entity0 bosses in touch with experts from the @entity138 ( @entity138 ) , who said they hope to find a way to remove the bird alive			1
@entity8 wildlife presenter @entity67 ( pictured ) intervened after hearing the protected bird was to be shot mr @entity67 said : ' shame on @entity36			1
they should have put @entity0 in touch with the @entity138 and not granted the licence in the first place			1
' we must give @entity0 due credit for doing the right thing			2
for those who say it is just a common bird and they are not in danger i say it is symbolic			0
' it is one little bird , but it shows the value we put on our wildlife			0
if we say it does n't matter about that one then where will we stop ? ' we should not just reach for the gun			0
in this country we have a wealth of experts to go to before resorting to the gun			0
' following the intervention , @entity79 tweeted : ' happy to liaise with @ - @entity138 , we 're going to explore other options over the next few weeks and will keep you updated			0
' @entity170 responded on @entity51 : ' all @ @entity0 are going to work with @ - @entity138 to try again to catch the @entity171 ' and the guns are stood down			2
result and thank you all for lobbying			0
' ms @entity46 , who started the campaign , said she was ' very pleased ' that the apparent intervention of @entity67 had led to the bird getting a reprieve			2
she added : ' i 've seen the bird playing and cleaning it 's self on top of the freezers when doing my shopping and not once was i concerned about hygiene but thought how beautiful it was			0
' my nine - year - old daughter is also pleased that there is hopefully a happy ending to this story			0
' a @entity0 spokesman said : ' our goal is always to release any birds which have found their way into our stores , while ensuring we maintain our high standards of hygiene			2
' in spite of repeated efforts to free the bird including laying down traps , deploying nets and opening windows , we have been unsuccessful so far			0
' we 're going to continue to try to release the bird over the next few weeks			2
' the @entity0 spokesman was unable to say if other birds flying loose in stores had ever been shot			1
a spokesman for @entity36 said licences , such as the one granted to @entity0 , were issued ' occasionally ' but only when environment bosses were ' satisfied ' all other methods had been exhausted			1
the spokesman said : ' fouling by birds can contaminate foods destined for human consumption , constituting a serious health risk			2
' as such , licences are occasionally issued to remove birds to protect public health and safety , where those measures do not harm the conservation status of the species			0
' @entity36 must be satisfied all reasonable non-lethal methods - such as trapping and scaring - have been tried and proven ineffective before a licence to remove the bird is issued			1
' @entity12 in @entity13 ( pictured ) where a bird has narrowly avoided being killed by a sniper after an outcry by residents , customers and @entity8 wildlife presenter @entity67 the @entity230 said the loss of the bird would not affect the breed 's population and it was not one of ' conservation concern '			1
a spokesman for the bird charity added : ' in rare situations , when all non-lethal solutions have been fully explored , a license can be issued by @entity36 to allow an individual or organisation to shoot a bird that is considered to be causing a significant nuisance			1
' in this case , the licence may have been issued in recognition of the health and safety risks caused by a bird in a major superstore			1
the female pied wagtail has so far resisted attempts to lure it out and is surviving on crumbs on the cafe floor ' pied wagtails are not a species of conservation concern , and the small number of licenses granted for this purpose will not result in a significant population decline in the @entity265			1
' we would always ask that an organisation takes measures to ensure that , where they pose a risk , birds do n't enter their premises			0
' in the unfortunate event that they do , it is essential that they make every effort to resolve the issue non-lethally before considering this type of action			0

small pied wagtail has been flying around store for several weeks
staff were worried the bird posed a health and safety risk
@entity0 was granted a licence by @entity36 to bring in marksman
