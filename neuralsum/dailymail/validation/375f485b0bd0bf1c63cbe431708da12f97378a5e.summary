@entity0 insists the cracks in @entity3 's creaking defence have not been caused by mental weakness			1
the @entity6 wing angrily shot down the suggestion that psychological frailties had been the reason for the @entity12 ' wretched @entity11 campaign			1
@entity14 's team strode purposefully into this year 's championships on the back of three encouraging displays against @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 in november			2
some pundits even tipped the the @entity22 as dark horses for the title			2
but the same old self - inflicted gaffes that have cost them dear , with @entity27 now preparing to complete a miserable run by handing the @entity29 neighbours their fifth straight defeat in @entity31 this saturday			1
@entity0 knows his side have let themselves down - but he insist their problems do not start in the mind			1
@entity0 has dismissed talk of mental weakness in the @entity3 camp he said : ' no - 100 per cent not			1
i would almost take offence to the notion of that			2
' listen , i can understand the questions that are asked because people obviously look at the performances and think there is a button here that needs to be pressed			2
' but there is definitely not a mental fragility			1
' the @entity12 kicked - off their campaign in @entity51 but despite notching the only try , they allowed @entity53 to kick their way to a 15 - 8 win following a string of penalties			1
@entity58 then took control of their second match at @entity61 after stand - off @entity62 was sin - binned when his ' reckless ' tackle left jumping @entity66 fly - half @entity64 in a heap			1
there was more misery in store as @entity72 's rolling maul steamrollered the @entity72 to a last - gasp win in the capital , while @entity3 sparkled briefly at @entity75 on saturday before the @entity76 fired back into a three - way shoot - out for the title by adding 15 unanswered points in the second half			1
' we need to stop being the creators of our own downfall at times , ' added @entity0			1
' but there is certainly no fragility on a mental aspect with any of the players i go out and play with			1
' we know exactly what we can do			2
we are fully confident in that			0
there needs to be an ability within all of us that we can do these things for 80 minutes			0
' but we are definitely not in a position where we are doubting our abilities			0
' @entity100 @entity99 v @entity3 - extended highlights @entity3 have lost all four of their @entity11 matches in this year 's competition @entity27 will now go in search of the win which will see them pip @entity99 and @entity58 to the @entity11 title this weekend			1
that leaves the @entity12 facing the ominous prospect that if they can not repel @entity110 's side , they will end this year 's @entity112 joust with a five - game whitewash for the third time since 2004			2
in that case , it would leave @entity14 open to the charge his first campaign had been a failure - but @entity0 insists that assessment is too simplistic			1
he said : ' it 's probably too easy ( to describe this campaign as a failure ) i think			2
' let 's not beat about the bush , we have not won a game yet			0
a tournament is going to be defined for the mass part for a lot of people based on the back of wins or losses			0
@entity3 end their dismal campaign against @entity27 at @entity61 on saturday ' now in that case , you can say ' well we can write this one off - it 's not been what we want			1
it 's been a failure '			0
' however , with this squad it has to be a learning process			0
it has to be the idea that we are building something that goes beyond five or six weeks			0
' it started in the autumn and is building up to the @entity152 - that has to be the mindset			0
' there has been a lot of disappointment in the results from this tournament			0
however , the elements that have shown improvement can only mean that we have to progress from this			0
' we have shown the flaws that we need to fix in order to go on			0
' so in terms of fixtures , it 's been disappointing but it 's not been a failure in terms of the growth of the squad			0
if we learn from the mistakes and swallow the big pills we have had to take , then we can come off the back of it stronger			0

@entity3 have lost all four matches so far in @entity11
@entity0 insists poor showing is not *due* to mental weakness
