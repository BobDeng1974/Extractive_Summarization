a team of researchers have trained stingrays to memorise targets and work for their food			1
the test , which was conducted by a team of researchers at @entity8 in @entity9 , northern @entity10 , is intended to enhance the lives of stingrays living in captivity			1
the test , which is the first enrichment program to ever be tested on stingrays , works by improving the memory of the cartilaginous fish , reports @entity18			2
researchers in @entity9 conduct tests on stingrays to make them work for their food one of the aquarists involved in the study @entity24 said it has been an overwhelming success			2
' we created individual targets for each of the three stingrays we have here , ' she said			0
' at first we used some food to bait them towards the target so they became familiar with it			0
but very quickly , within a week , when we put the targets in they were coming straight to it			0
' another researcher from the project , @entity40 researcher @entity39 , said the test is intended to break up the monotony of caged animal 's lifestyle			0
' we 're wanting to change the monotony and the routines of the daily regimes that can be associated with captive species , ' she said			0
' so instead of just being presented with their food at the same time every day , with no interaction or thought behind it , we 're really making them earn their living , which is a really innate and natural behaviour			0
@entity40 researcher @entity39 , said the test is intended to break up the monotony of caged animal 's lifestyle the researchers also hope the tests could allow them to capture the animals with more ease in the future ' we have to keep them thinking , keep them moving , and give them something different in their day - to - day routine			1
' the researchers also hope the tests could allow them to capture the animals with more ease in the future			1
if the stingray 's can memorise the targets , they will be easier to move between exhibits .			1

the test was conducted by a team of researchers in northern @entity10
the *scientists* trained them to memorise targets and work for their food
the researchers hope it will be easier to move the animals in the future
