@entity3 departments are so busy that closing more will cost lives , @entity1 ’s top emergency doctor has warned			1
dr @entity5 said @entity7 bosses must urgently rethink any plans they have to shut casualty units because it will ‘ risk patient safety ’ – and take patient care into ‘ uncharted territory ’			1
dr @entity5 ’s comments come amid fears a new wave of @entity3 closures could sweep the @entity7 after may ’s general election , despite the unprecedented demand and longer waiting times for emergency treatment			1
but the changes often lead to patients who need urgent treatment travelling further in ambulances or being told to go to a centre staffed by general doctors and nurses , rather than specialised units			2
last week , 17 hospitals across @entity44 declared ‘ major incidents ’			1
some @entity47 were so full that doctors shut their doors on ambulance crews trying to bring in seriously ill patients , paramedics claimed			1
dr @entity5 , president of the @entity30 , said part of the reason for this winter ’s chaos was that @entity44 ’s network of @entity3 units had shrunk in the past decade , even though demand had ballooned			1
over the past ten years the number of people attending fully staffed and equipped @entity47 has jumped 13 per cent to 14.2 million			0
that is equivalent to the number of patients treated annually by 25 @entity3 departments , according to a report by the highly - respected @entity68 think - tank			2
but instead of building more , 13 a&es have been closed since 2005			0
they have been downgraded to ‘ urgent care centres ’ ( @entity72 ) or ‘ minor injury units ’ ( @entity74 ) , which can not deal with serious illness or injury			2
some are closed at night			0
nine of the 13 @entity3 closures have occurred under the @entity81 government			1
most recently , two were downgraded in west @entity82 last september , and figures now show @entity3 waits have spiked at nearby @entity85 , to which patients are being transferred			2
@entity44 now has 181 a&es , which health bosses argue is still too many , saying the evidence from cutting smaller stroke , heart attack and trauma units is that centralising emergency services saves lives			1
closures : across @entity44 since 2005 , 13 a&es have been ' downgraded ' - meaning they were closed and replaced with urgent care centres or minor injury units but dr @entity5 said @entity100 were already ‘ incredibly busy ’ by international standards – and that widespread closures would worsen the situation			1
around a dozen a&es are thought to be under threat			0
dr @entity5 said : ‘ in @entity44 we talk about a small emergency department being one that deals with 60,000 patients a year			1
' but in the @entity110 , @entity111 and much of @entity112 that would probably be the largest emergency department in the country			0
’ the combined effect of increasing demand and the 13 closures means the ‘ average ’ @entity118 @entity3 now sees 78,500 patients a year – up 13,000 , or 20 per cent , since 2004			1
dr @entity5 said : ‘ the idea we need to reduce the number of emergency departments and centralise more services , seems to me a fairly brave statement given we are already at one end of the scale , when you compare us internationally			0
for more than two years @entity31 has campaigned to save a&es from closure			0
we have cut through @entity7 and ministerial spin to show how shutting departments has led to neighbouring hospitals becoming gridlocked , while towns have been left with inadequate services			2
given current demands on our emergency departments , any further reduction would be a potential risk to patient safety			0
’ a year ago , @entity44 unveiled a controversial plan to develop 40 to 70 ‘ major emergency centres ’			1
@entity44 medical director prof sir @entity143 insisted this would not result in closures , but critics said it would lead to a ‘ two - tier ’ @entity3 system in which smaller units suffered			1
insiders say the scheme has been put on ice over fears it amounts to ‘ political suicide ’ – a claim denied by @entity44			1
but it is believed the plan will be revived after may			0
dr @entity5 said : ‘ we have succeeded in creating large emergency departments that give us economies of scale , and concentrate expertise			0
' but to go any further is to go into uncharted territory globally			0
’ dr @entity5 stressed he was not against every single downgrade and said ‘ rationalisation ’ sometimes made sense			2
but just because centralising stroke , heart attack and trauma units had worked , that did not mean the same approach would benefit the other 95 per cent of @entity3 patients			1
latest weekly statistics show only 79.8 per cent of patients attending @entity44 ’s 181 @entity47 were treated within four hours			2
the target is 95 per cent			0
dr @entity176 , of @entity44 , said : ‘ the @entity7 continues to face unprecedented pressures on frontline services			1
@entity179 is at its highest for the last three winters			0
’ the @entity7 is under so much strain , medical students are being drafted in to do unpaid hospital shifts , @entity31 has learnt			2
fifth - year students at @entity185 have been asked to ‘ undertake extra shift and weekend work ’ in local hospitals , according to a leaked email from professor @entity189 , dean of its medical school			2
students are not being forced to do the extra shifts , which come on top of their normal placements , but prof @entity189 wrote : ‘ we have no doubt you will rise to the occasion			0
’ students last night said they were keen to help			0
but one said : ‘ there is no way of dressing this up as anything other than desperation			0
’ volunteers will get travel expenses and a ‘ subsistence ’ allowance .			0
