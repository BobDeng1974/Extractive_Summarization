by @entity0 published : 14:21 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 17:36 est , 12 march 2013 a mother has spoken of her fury after doctors sent her son home 11 times in five months before discovering a football - sized tumour in his stomach			1
@entity9 was told her five - year - old son @entity10 was suffering from constipation - when all along he had neuroblastoma , a rare and aggressive cancer with one of the lowest survival rates			1
miss @entity9 believes the time delay in diagnosis may now affect whether he survives the disease or not			1
he has been given a survival rate of less than 40 per cent			2
delay : @entity9 claims she was sent home by doctors eleven times in five months before her son @entity10 was finally diagnosed with an aggressive form of childhood cancer happier times : @entity10 , before he fell ill. the delay in diagnosing his cancer means his chance of survival is now less than 40 per cent @entity10 had been diagnosed with @entity31 - a form of autism - which doctors said could cause consitpation miss @entity9 , who lives in @entity34 , said : ‘ if we had n’t been fobbed off so much for so long , and @entity10 had been diagnosed earlier , maybe he would have much better odds today			1
' i ’m just hoping that he can been strong enough to fight this terrible disease			0
i am so angry that he was sent home by doctors eleven times before it was diagnosed			2
‘ it was only because i was so convinced that something was terribly wrong that i kept going back to the doctors repeatedly			2
‘ when he was finally diagnosed with cancer i was so angry that it had n’t been spotted before			2
’ @entity10 first started complaining of stomach ache in january last year			1
he was also refusing to eat and appeared pale			2
miss @entity9 , who is separated from @entity10 ’s father , took him to the gp			1
the doctor told @entity52 that it was probably just constipation , but the problems worsened over the next few weeks and his stomach started to swell			2
she took him back to the doctors twice more			0
both times she was referred to @entity58 , here doctors gave him laxatives and sent him home			2
miss @entity9 said : ‘ i was so worried about @entity10			1
he had severe stomach ache constantly and his stomach was swelling			0
‘ he was diagnosed with @entity31 - a form of autism - at the age of three , and they said that constipation can be a problem for autistic children			0
‘ i told the doctors i was n’t happy with the diagnosis of constipation and i begged them to scan him , but they would n’t , as they told me that stomach ache was very common			1
’ in march , she took him back to the gp for his sixth visit , who gave him a different type of laxative to try			0
then in april , she was forced to take him to both the gp and then the out - of - hours surgery at the hospital as it was during a weekend and she was so worried			0
she said : ‘ by now i was almost demented with worry			0
he was losing weight , his spine was protruding , and his stomach was even more swollen			0
‘ by may , when i took him for his ninth appointment , he looked nine months pregnant			1
he had stopped going to school as he was in so much pain			0
he could n’t walk properly as he could n’t stand straight , instead he wanted to crawl everywhere			0
battling : @entity10 was only diagnosed with neuroblastoma after he was seen by doctors for the 11th time - and his mother insisted on a scan ‘ i did n’t know what to do - i was at the end of my tether			1
i had gone to the gp ’s , the out of hours surgery and the hospital nearly a dozen times , but no - one would listen to me			0
i felt like i ’d been failed on every account			0
‘ in desperation i even rang his paediatrician whom he is under for @entity31 , but even she could n’t help			0
' on her 11th visit to the @entity91 , she was once again referred to the @entity58			1
this time , as she sat in @entity102 , she told the nurse that she was n’t leaving the hospital until @entity10 had been given a scan			1
she said : ‘ i sat in the hospital with @entity10 in my arms and i was so angry i shouted at the nurses that i was n’t going anywhere			1
‘ i did n’t care who was watching me , i had to get someone to listen to me			0
i could see my boy was dying and no - one was doing anything about it			0
’ the hospital agreed to do a ct scan and when they saw the results the doctors immediately carried out more scans and biopsies			2
‘ the sonographer asked the nurse if @entity10 was an in - patient , and told her that if he was n’t , he needed to be admitted fast			1
he had seen something on the scan but i did n’t know what it was			2
’ fight : @entity10 's mother said that even before he was diagnosed , he was unable to stand because of the pain @entity10 was then referred to the @entity130 where @entity52 was told that he had neuroblastoma , an aggressive childhood cancer			1
‘ i was devastated , but i ’d known that something was badly wrong with my boy			0
the doctors told me the tumour in his stomach was the size of a basketball and it was so big that they could n’t even see his lungs or liver on the scan			1
’ a stage two or three tumour has a survival rate of 80 - 95 percent , but @entity10 had a stage four tumour , where the survival rate drops to less than 40 per cent			1
miss @entity9 said : ‘ i was so angry i could n’t even think straight			1
all this time when i ’d been fighting for someone to take me seriously , cancer was ravaging my son			0
’ @entity10 is currently undergoing chemotherapy and he also needs an operation to remove the tumour			1
miss @entity9 is also raising funds to take him to @entity156 for treatment , at a cost of £ 250,000			2
treatment : @entity10 is currently undergoing chemotherapy and needs surgery to remove the tumour miss @entity9 added : ‘ the doctors and nurses at the @entity130 have been fantastic , and i ’m hoping that @entity10 will pull through			1
‘ but i ’m so angry with the previous doctors , that i was sent home 11 times			0
i can only hope that my son survives after all this			0
’ @entity168 , chief executive for the @entity169 , said : ‘ it can be a difficult cancer to diagnose , but it is a nasty and phenomenally aggressive cancer , so a few months delay in diagnosis can make such a difference as a neuroblastoma tumour can grow from two to 12 centimetres in a fortnight			1
’ dr @entity175 , medical director at @entity176 , said : ‘ @entity177 is deeply sorry to hear about this family ’s distress , it ’s always very upsetting when a family member is seriously ill , particularly so when it ’s a child			0
‘ we are unable to discuss details of individual cases due to patient confidentiality			0
whilst i ’m not aware of the family raising any complaint with the @entity176 , i will be writing to them to arrange a meeting in person so that they can discuss their concerns in detail with us			0
