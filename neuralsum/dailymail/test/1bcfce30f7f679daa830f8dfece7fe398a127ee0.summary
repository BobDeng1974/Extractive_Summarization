@entity1 star @entity1 's secret college bullying shame has been exposed by court documents unearthed from the actor 's time at the @entity5			1
according to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by @entity10 , the 44 - year - old @entity7 winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong			1
the documents claim that @entity17 , 44 , was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic november 1990 initiation , but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom			1
the actor is pictured ( right ) this week according to the explosive court documents , @entity17 was in his sophomore year at @entity5 when a prospective 21 - year - old pledge was called to the @entity30 house at 2.30am			1
when he got there , according to @entity42 documents , @entity17 - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him , ' it 's going to be a long night ! ' the unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity			1
the alleged victim told police that @entity17 and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear , ' pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion ' , causing ' great pain '			1
the pledged then claimed that @entity17 led him to a basement ' pit ' where he slammed the junior 's face into the ground while he was doing push - ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight			2
shockingly , after this , @entity17 is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge 's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down , but instead made him blow them out			1
shame : the allegedly assault saw @entity17 and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21 - year - old pledge and beat him with a paddle at the end of the vicious hazing ritual , the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the ' @entity88 ' where @entity17 ' hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room '			1
allegedly not content with this , @entity17 then went onto to break into another potential pledge 's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation			2
however , the morning after , the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him ' hiding in a closet at his apartment , his buttocks and legs black with brusises			0
' @entity111 pleading with his mother not to go public , saying ' they 'll come kill me ! ' , she reported the incident to the police			0
high school senior : these pictures of @entity1 are from 1989 , the year he graduated from @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121 and one year before his admission to @entity5 early career : @entity1 is pictured here on the 1996 show @entity126 - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident huge hit : @entity130 and the character of @entity132 has given @entity1 his biggest role to date - winning a @entity7 for his work on the @entity136 series eight warrants were issued for @entity17 and seven other frat members , which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident			1
three members of @entity30 were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and @entity17 was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991			1
in the wake of the hazing incident , the @entity30 fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge 's mother made her son 's alleged assault public by going to the police			1
in 1990 , the @entity154 reported that @entity30 would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were ' physically and psychologically attacked '			0
the - then national president of @entity30 , @entity158 , said that he was revoking the charter of its @entity5 , saying , ' basically , we 're out of business on this campus '			2
' but our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today			0
' a warrant was issued for @entity17 's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed			2
he returned home to live with his family in @entity121 and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30 - day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career			2
a friend told @entity10 that although shocking , ' the hazing incident was an isolated incident in @entity1 's life			2
since then , he 's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person			0
' hazing incident : following the alleged assault of the 21 - year - old pledge , the @entity30 at @entity5 ( pictured ) was shut down recently , the @entity191 star has admitted that playing the complex role of @entity132 has taken its toll			1
in an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days , @entity17 opened up about the effect that playing @entity197 ad man @entity132 had on his psyche			0
the 44 - year - old star told @entity201 : ' playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties , it ’s not fun to live in this guy ’s headspace year after year			0
' he added : ' people ask , " what ’s the difference between you and @entity132 ? " look , i drink , i get drunk			0
i ’m not immune to that , ' and ( creator ) @entity214 ( @entity215 ) will tell you , the darkness in @entity132 has not abated , it ’s gotten worse year after year			0
and it can be hard on you as a person			0
i love coming to work ; i love the people i work with			0
but it ’s been rough			0
' as he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark , brooding , alcoholic womanizing character , @entity1 revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona .			0
