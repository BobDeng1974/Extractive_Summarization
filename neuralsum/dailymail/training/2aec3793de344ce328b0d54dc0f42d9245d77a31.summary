three grey men in grey t - shirts delivered a grey document on thursday aimed at redefining the @entity4 football team as something a little less bulldog and a little more greyhound			1
billed as ' @entity4 dna : evolving			2
winning ' , it is the product of 12 months of hiring and firing and restructuring behind the scenes by @entity11 , the @entity12 's director of elite development and will involve giving the players memory - chip wristbands which they can access back at their clubs so they can remember the work they have done with their country			1
@entity11 has kept his profile low since replacing sir @entity19 in this role , busily putting things in place and this was his coming out party , formalising the power - shift behind the scenes			1
@entity11 ( right ) , the @entity12 's director of elite development , pictured with @entity4 under 21 manager @entity27 revealed the ' @entity29 ' blueprint on thursday he presented the document with @entity32 manager @entity27 and head of player and coach development @entity35 , recruited from @entity37 , where the prolific @entity38 is under the authority of @entity40 , former technical director of the @entity12 , who once worked with @entity41 to produce a document very like this one			1
@entity11 has busily created a new blueprint aimed at redefining the @entity4 national team the irony must have been lost somewhere between @entity47 and @entity48 , where @entity11 will extend his @entity8 vision to 1,500 coaches from the @entity12 's @entity51 who will gather , over the weekend			1
it is simply a collection of commonsense ideas committed to print after thorough research , including studies into how other nations do things - six in @entity59 and three in @entity60			1
it may help coaches at all levels to have a point of reference about what the international teams are striving for , and it may help players of different ages to have a memory stick on a wristband which reminds them of what playing for @entity4 is about , should they chose to plug it into their laptop or tablet			1
but , in truth , this is another largely underwhelming document trying to be all things to as many people as possible , without causing offence			2
@entity11 's team want @entity4 want to break from the traditional blood and sweat , but not forget about it			1
they want to work with the clubs , but want more players to be released by clubs to boost experience on an international stage			2
if they want the ' golden thread ' to run through the youth ranks to the senior team , the release of players by the clubs is the key			0
we will see how @entity27 gets on when he selects a squad for the @entity98 next year			0
it is hoped the ideas may help coaches at all levels have a point of reference about what the international team is striving for to increase the number of times a player samples international football , @entity11 has introduced @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 age groups			1
at some expense , the @entity115 have a full programme of fixtures , but will not play a competitively until 2017 at the earliest , since they have not qualified for next year 's @entity120 in @entity121			0
they want players to be comfortable with the ball - and without it			0
they want them to be tactically aware and flexible and technically adept			0
they want them to ' intelligently dominate possession '			0
they want pride and passion and they want high standards of behaviour			0
who does n't ? the @entity12 will provide a clear coaching plan â€“ focusing on eight positions on the field and phases of play - and the best care and support			1
they took a teacher with the squad to the @entity145 in @entity146 , this year to help four players taking gcses			0
@entity150 's @entity149 even stayed in @entity146 to sit an exam on the day his team - mates travelled home			1
@entity150 's @entity149 stayed in @entity146 to sit an exam during a trip with the @entity4 under 17 squad the principles are admirable			2
most of it has been heard before in different guises			0
@entity4 boasted they were the best prepared team at the @entity120 in @entity162			2
they were also among the first to leave for home			0
ultimately , what @entity4 need to win a @entity120 is more and better players			2
@entity11 admits 90 per cent of player development in @entity4 is done by the clubs , which leaves him addressing the final 10 per cent , which adapts them for international football			1
the @entity172 is two years into their @entity173 , their own pathway to more and better home - grown footballers			0
they all claim to consult closely , but do they , really ? clouding the issue further is the commission launched by @entity12 chairman @entity179 with a view to creating an @entity4 team capable of winning the @entity120 in 2022 , by recommending feeder clubs			1
and a @entity183 , introduced by @entity179 's predecessor @entity184 , to improve behaviour			0
and now we have another			0
or is it grey ?			0
