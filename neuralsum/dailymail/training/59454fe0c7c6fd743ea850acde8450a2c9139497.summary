and in the following months he tried to make the most of the time he had left by spending it with his children and grandchildren			2
hospital porter : @entity3 ( pictured with his granddaughter @entity17 ) was warned he had just nine months to live after tests appeared to show he had developed lethal mesothelioma one of his biggest fears was not living long enough to see his son get married			1
but he survived to attend the ceremony , and to see two new grandchildren and two great - grandchildren born			2
then , in march - almost three years after the original diagnosis at @entity25 in @entity4 - he found his ‘ cancer ’ of the lungs was actually another non-life - threatening , asbestos - related condition			1
mr @entity3 , who is also a father of two , said : ‘ i 've spent almost three years fearing i 'd die any time and my family have suffered horribly			1
i prepared to not be around for much longer			0
‘ and [ @entity32 ] went through the awful feelings that go with that			0
then i was shocked to the core when they told me the original lab results were wrong and i 'm still trying to come to terms with it			0
‘ it is wonderful to know that i am not dying but i have lost all confidence in doctors and do n't know if i ever will regain it			0
’ mr @entity3 began suffering breathing problems several years ago			1
he was admitted to @entity25 before being referred to a specialist who performed a biopsy			0
suspected mesothelioma was diagnosed - with exposure to asbestos in a previous job as an insulation engineer cited as a probable reason			1
mr @entity3 believed he was to become one of the 2,000 @entity55 men whose lives are claimed by the disease each year			1
victims are normally expected to live between six and 18 months			2
told he could die at any time : mr @entity3 gave up his job and began chemotherapy in the hope of surviving he was even visited by palliative care nurses who advised on how best to spend what time he had left			1
he agreed to undergo chemotherapy , and stunned staff in the oncology ward with his progress			0
almost all people who undergo chemotherapy experience side effects			0
some are as follows : other possible side effects include bruising , bleeding , mucositis , loss of appetite , dry skin , memory and sleep problems , sexual issues , diarrhoea , constipation and depression mr @entity3 said they labelled him ‘ their best patient ’ after discovering he was regularly going cycling in between treatment sessions			2
the correct diagnosis only emerged after mr @entity3 instructed his lawyers , @entity92 , to prepare a claim for compensation against the insurers of his former employers			1
they sent him for fresh tests after becoming suspicious about the length of time he had lived since the diagnosis			2
the second opinion confirmed mr @entity3 was ‘ unlikely to have mesothelioma ’			1
he said : ‘ when i turned up for treatment staff at the oncology ward kept telling me i was their best patient			0
‘ my disease had not progressed to the end stage they expected and the truth only emerged when my lawyer questioned the diagnosis			0
’ his family say the ordeal of being told their husband , father and grandfather had only months to live has had a ‘ horrendous ’ impact			2
his wife @entity120 said : ‘ we are hugely relieved @entity3 is not desperately ill but devastated about what we all went through			2
surely these hospital tests should always be checked and rechecked			2
’ his solicitor @entity124 , of @entity92 , said : ‘ the original pathologist said mr @entity126 had mesothelioma which is caused by asbestos			0
but our independent pathologist 's opinion says it is unlikely he does			0
‘ he has other asbestos related conditions not immediately life - threatening			1
it has been extremely traumatic for him and indeed his family			0
treatment : mr @entity3 began suffering breathing problems several years ago			1
he was admitted to @entity25 in @entity4 ( pictured ) before being referred to a specialist who performed a biopsy ‘ we are discussing ways to resolve his case and obtain compensation for the asbestos - related conditions he does have and for what he has had to endure since his original diagnosis			1
’ mr @entity3 admits he is bitter about having to give up his hospital job after working there for six years			1
' it is wonderful to know that i am not dying but i have lost all confidence in doctors and do n't know if i ever will regain it ' @entity3 he said : ‘ i loved my job and would have stayed on much longer			1
however , the terminal diagnosis made me give it up because i had so little time left to spend it with my family			0
‘ my daughter , @entity159 , and son @entity160 , were heartbroken and struggled to accept that i was dying			0
‘ we now have to tell people that i no longer have this death sentence and everyone is just as stunned as us			0
it is a huge struggle to take it all but we have to move forward and cope			0
’ he has been supported throughout by @entity167 charity			0
an @entity169 spokesman said : ‘ due to patient confidentiality , we can not comment on individual cases			0
