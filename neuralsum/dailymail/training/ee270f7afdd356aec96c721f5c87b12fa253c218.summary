by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 19 july 2013 it could be a scene from @entity3 classic @entity2			0
@entity4 , a 15 - week - old fox cub , was left abandoned when her father killed most of her litter before the cubs had opened their eyes for the first time			1
now she has formed a firm friendship with terrier @entity12 , a @entity15 cross , at the home of her owner @entity17 in @entity18 , despite the two creatures being natural enemies			2
rosie the fox cub and @entity12 the terrier have become firm friends , even snoozing together at the @entity25 home of @entity12 's owner @entity17 the pair do not usually share a bed because of their difference in size but @entity12 's owner @entity17 hopes that could change when @entity4 gets bigger the pair have the run of mr @entity17 's five - acre estate in @entity35 , @entity25 , including this venture in to the vegetable patch the four - legged friends have plenty of energy and like to chase each other around vegetable patch the friends have separate feeding times so they do n't fight but are trained together with treats the pair indulge in rough and tumble while mr @entity17 , 44 , and his girlfriend @entity0 , 41 , try to teach @entity4 a few tricks so she can settle in at their home in the @entity51 mountains near @entity35 , @entity25			1
mr @entity17 said : ' nothing is known about what happened to @entity4 's mum			2
all we know is that her dad went rogue and she was the only survivor and was hand - reared before her eyes had even opened			0
' @entity4 was slowly introduced to @entity12			2
@entity12 has always been playful and it 's a natural instinct for a fox cub to play so they get on great			2
' they have become best of friends , although we always supervise them playing together as @entity4 is still quite small			2
@entity12 and @entity4 are reminiscent of @entity3 classic @entity2 , where @entity66 the fox and @entity68 the hunting dog become firm friends despite being natural enemies mr @entity17 and his girlfriend @entity0 are training @entity4 with a little help from their terrier @entity12 @entity4 , posing in front of a portrait of a fox , has made herself at home at the @entity17 residence although she rests and dozes around the house , @entity4 sleeps in a crate at night to stop her chewing through the television 's wires ' they chase each other around and @entity4 often dives on @entity12			1
the living room is usually a wreck after they have been playing			0
' mr @entity17 , a wildlife photographer , and his girlfriend moved to the area last year from @entity94 to run a holiday home in @entity96			0
now they 've acquired a new friend in @entity4 while @entity12 pitches in to help show the fox cub what to do			1
most importantly , the cub has already learned to sit nicely to earn a treat			0
@entity12 's owner @entity17 , with his pet terrier at his feet and @entity4 in his arms , is trying to house train the cub the pair create ' destruction ' while they play together , according to @entity12 's owner mr bowler despite the differences in their size , the pair indulge in good - natured play tussles around the house and grounds @entity4 's slight build helps her get the better of @entity12 in the battle for the tennis ball as she looks to run away ' i feel it 's important that @entity4 has a good bond with @entity12 as when it comes to training @entity12 shows @entity4 what is required , ' mr @entity17 said			1
' @entity4 is very quick to pick things up though			0
' i 've been amazed at how clever she is , certainly quicker to pick up things than @entity12 ever was			0
her recall and sitting is 100 per cent and we 're almost there with toilet training			0
@entity4 is only 15 weeks old but has already lost all of her siblings when their father attacked and killed them			1
it is not known what happened to her mother @entity4 is quicker at picking up her training than @entity12 the terrier was , mr @entity17 said @entity4 moves in on a plant as she explores her new home in the @entity51 mountains mr @entity17 's five - acre estate near @entity35 , @entity25 , has plenty of space for @entity4 to roam ' they do n't sleep together , we have a large dog crate in the living room for @entity4 that has her bed in it			1
we only put her in her crate at night and that 's just to stop her chewing through the wires of the tv			0
' when she 's awake the door to the crate is open allowing her access to the living room , she also has access to our fenced in patio / veg garden while we train her			0
the cub is being gradually introduced to different parts of the property , starting with a fenced in patio and vegetable garden the fox cub has almost mastered her toilet training and quickly learned to sit nicely to earn a titbit the pair have the run of their owners ' home in the @entity51 mountains near @entity35 , @entity25 @entity12 is helping mr @entity17 and his girlfriend @entity0 to train @entity4 as well as being her playmate ' we will then start introducing her to our bottom paddock that we have fenced in with two inch chicken wire , this area is about an acre and we are developing it as an orchard and wildflower meadow so she will have a lovely area to run around in and play with @entity12			1
' when @entity4 gets bigger we hope that her and @entity12 will sleep together at the moment though as soon as they are together it 's just fun and games and destruction			1
' foxes and dogs may be natural enemies but nobody told @entity4 and @entity12 , who have formed a strong bond once she 's had a bit more training , @entity4 will be allowed to explore the orchard and meadow she was abandoned shortly after her birth but @entity4 is thriving in @entity12 's company			1
