the horrors of trench life have been well documented , but now it seems @entity4 soldiers on the @entity5 had more than just shells and bullets to contend with			1
a grisly list of the most common injuries and ailments endured by men serving in the @entity12 reveals sexually transmitted diseases , haemorrhoids and wasp stings were among the most debilitating			1
while gunshot wounds , trench foot and mustard gas poisoning feature heavily in the previously unseen archive , the men also often went sick with diseases such as gonorrhoea and syphilis according to researchers , who have painstakingly transcribed 30,000 medical records			1
piles were a persistent problem for the men brought about by the cold ground they had to sit on coupled with the lack of care over their personal hygiene			2
@entity56 was another hindrance as soldiers were unable to stand up tall in the trenches in case they were picked off by a @entity61 sniper			1
the increased pressure on their knees and ankle joints from having to constantly crouch down led to complaints of arthritis despite their relatively young age			1
and a rather surprising ailment that often had to be treated by medics was wasp stings			1
researchers from the military genealogy website @entity74 are in the process of transcribing and digitising 1.5 million unseen medical records from the @entity12 that are held at the @entity77 at @entity78 , west @entity79			1
@entity80 visits wounded soldiers at @entity82 , @entity83			1
expected occupational hazards such as gunshot wound , trench foot and mustard gas poisoning feature heavily in the previously unseen archive they have completed the first tranche of 30,000 records that will be available online for people to search their ancestors from tomorrow			1
it is expected that it will take another two years to transcribe and upload the whole archive			0
this is the first time such records have been accessible to the wider public			1
experts say it is invaluable as , while information on soldiers who were killed was recorded , hardly any exists for those who were injured and survived			2
most medical records were destroyed after the @entity12 or during the @entity105 in @entity106			1
the records being made available now came from the @entity108 , in particular the 51st @entity109 , a frontline medical unit			1

researchers from the military genealogy website @entity74 are in the process of transcribing and digitising 1.5 million unseen records @entity118 , chief executive of @entity74 , said : ' for those killed in battle , names can generally be found in rolls of honour , war diaries or names on a cenotaph			1
' however , for personnel who were injured and survived , military information tends to be very scarce			0
an entry in a medical register might be the only record of their ww1 service			2
' they can show who was treated , for what and their movements after being patched up or taken to hospital			0
' @entity140 , cold , squalid conditions of trench warfare brought with it untold discomfort and suffering			0
' from conditions such as gunshot wounds , trench foot and mustard gas poisoning to tonsillitis , @entity152 flu and even in - growing toenails , few men escaped unscathed			0
' these records are priceless pieces of information for families looking up their ancestor 's past			2
unless they had been killed , many went through the war largely undocumented			0
' a soldier who was killed or badly injured in action would often make the news back home but one suffering from haemorrhoids would not , understandably			0
' to coincide with the release of information , @entity74 has also published an e-book called @entity171 and @entity172 that explains in layman 's terms some of the medical procedures carried out			2
the e-book also contains a top 20 list of the most common complaints among the men			0
the unique research has shown that seemingly benign wounds , like a cut to the finger , often led to much more serious illness and infection due to the level of bacteria in the trenches @entity189 , curator of collections at the @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity193 , has helped the researchers with their work			1
she said : ' this is an invaluable source of research that gives people the opportunity to trace an ancestor , the type of injury or ailment they suffered and what happened to them afterwards			0
' the top 20 list is the most accurate breakdown of ailments soldiers suffered in the trenches			1
' infections presented the biggest problem			0
a simple cut to a finger from cleaning your gun or digging a trench could quite quickly become infected and develop into pneumonia			0
' the men were knee deep in mud nine out of 12 months of the year surrounded by bacteria from the bodies of men and animals in @entity227			0
' their bodies were weaker anyway from a lack of sleep , wet and dirty clothes and a restricted diet in which a piece of fruit or vegetable was a treat			0
' the unique research has shown that seemingly benign wounds , like a cut to the finger , often led to much more serious illness and infection due to the level of bacteria in the trenches			2
it also highlights that , apart from being shot or hit by a shell fragment , one of the most deadly injuries a soldier could suffer was a broken leg , even from an innocuous fall			0
injured @entity253 were jolted and banged about so much during their journey on a stretcher from the front to a field ambulance and a casualty station that the fractured femur bone would often rupture an artery			0
during the early part of the war , a soldier with a broken leg had an 80 per cent chance of dying but after the @entity267 traction splint came into use in 1916 that rate went down to just seven per cent .			0

gonorrhoea and syphilis among most debilitating ailments for soldiers

stds were rife in the @entity12 as soldiers visited @entity43 brothels looking for ' warmth and comfort ' to escape the horrors of the trenches
