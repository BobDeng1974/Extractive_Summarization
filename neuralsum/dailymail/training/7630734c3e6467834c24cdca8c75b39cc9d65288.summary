' @entity193 's £ 8 minimum wage a ' threat to jobs ' @entity197 's plan to raise the minimum wage to please ' @entity199 ' will cost jobs and squeeze the better off , @entity7 was warned last night			1
kicking off his party 's annual conference yesterday , mr @entity197 unveiled eye - catching proposals to force employers to pay staff at least £ 8 an hour			2
he said he had been inspired to bring in the increase after meeting a low - paid worker at the @entity199 fast food chain			0
the most junior members of staff there get the current minimum of up to £ 6.31 an hour , according to job adverts			0
the rate , which applies to about 1.4million workers , will increase to £ 6.50 an hour from next month and business leaders warned that is the highest it can be without putting jobs at risk			0
@entity221 , head of economics at the @entity224 think - tank , said : ' major hikes in the national minimum wage could actually lead to slower pay increases for those slightly up the pay scale , who still struggle on relatively low incomes			0
' mr @entity197 's announcement would see the minimum wage raised in annual stages to at least £ 8 an hour by 2020 , adding around £ 3,000 a year to salaries of those working 40 hours a week			0
this would save the taxpayer ' hundreds of millions of pounds ' in welfare payments , the @entity7 leader said			2
he rejected suggestions that an above - inflation rise in the minimum wage would be unaffordable for the public sector , which is one of the biggest employers of low - paid staff , and would cost jobs			1
' what is happening at the moment is that we are spending billions of pounds subsidising employers who are paying low wages , billions of pounds in benefits , tax credits and housing benefit , ' mr @entity197 told @entity259 's @entity258			0
@entity260 , chairman of the @entity261 , said : ' our concern is that setting rates according to political need means that the impact of rises on employment , inflation and growth will not be fully explored			0
sectors such as retail and social care are run on very fine margins , and will struggle with substantial increases to the minimum wage rate that fail to take wider economic conditions into account			0
' but @entity280 general secretary @entity279 said : ' raising the minimum wage and putting more money into the hands of low - paid workers wo n't just be welcomed by hard - pressed families , it will also be good news for local economies who will benefit from a boost in workers ' spending power			0
