@entity1 , 36 , haemorrhaged during an emergency caesarean section due to placenta accreta , a condition which affects just one in 2,500 pregnancies			1
it occurs when the placenta attaches itself to scar tissue left from a previous operation			1
mrs @entity1 , of @entity16 , required seven litres of blood and her family was warned that she and her baby son @entity3 might not survive the delivery			1

' my husband was warned i might not wake up			2
it was a complete whirlwind			0
' five hours later i came round , having had the @entity32			0
my son had been taken to a different hospital and i was utterly disorientated			2
' after first experiencing heavy bleeding during the 18th week of her pregnancy , doctors at @entity39 told mrs @entity1 she had placenta praevia - otherwise known as low - lying placenta - which occurs in around one in 200 pregnancies			1
she said : ' they monitored the baby ’s heartbeat and thankfully everything seemed fine			2
i was told to go home and be very careful			0
' if i started bleeding again , i had to go back into hospital immediately			0
' one morning , while i was 26 weeks pregnant , i started bleeding heavily as i was getting my daughter ready for school			0
@entity3 was rushed to the neotnatal unit at @entity53 in @entity54			1

i pulled the emergency cord and suddenly i was surrounded by medical staff			2
' her husband @entity71 , 48 , a bricklayer , was called in to be by her side and she was prepped for an emergency caesarean section under general anesthetic			1
mrs @entity1 , a secondary school learning support worker , said : ' the doctors warned my family after i had been sedated that i was in a very serious situation			1
if they could n’t control the bleeding , then both @entity80 and the baby would have been lost			0
' during the delivery doctors battled to stabilise her , giving her more than 12 pints of blood over two hours			1
when she woke , five hours after being sedated , she was weak - and discovered @entity3 , who had been born weighing just 2lb 2oz , had been rushed to @entity53 in @entity54 for specialised care			1
mrs @entity1 ( with daughter @entity88 ) and @entity3 when he was five days old			1
she was so weak after the birth that she did see him until he was a few days old but two years on , @entity3 has developed into a perfectly healthy toddler despite his traumatic start to life doctors later explained to mrs @entity1 that her placenta had attached itself to scar tissue left over from the cesarean section delivery of her daughter @entity88 , now six - a far rarer condition called placenta accreta			1
the condition , which occurs in around one in 2,500 pregnancies , can cause serious complications and , as in mrs @entity1 ’s case , often requires a hysterectomy			2
he said : ' i know that for some people , having a hysterectomy for medical reasons can leave regret hanging over them , but not us			0
we do n’t want any more children - we are content with the family we have			0
' she added : ' i ’d had a @entity32 with @entity88 because she ’d had a breech birth			0
somehow , @entity3 ’s placenta had become attached to the scar tissue			1
' it explained the regular bleeding			0
every time @entity3 had moved in my womb , the lining had been seriously damaged			2
' mrs @entity1 needed a hysterectomy after @entity3 's birth but says with him and daughter @entity88 , her family is now complete in the end , she did n't see him until he was five days old , when she was strong enough to leave hospital and travel to the neonatal unit at @entity133 ’s			1
she said : ' i felt very protective over him			0
until then , i ’d been disorientated and overwhelmed , but to see him in the ward with all the other premature children was a very emotional experience			0
' having turned two in february , @entity3 is hitting developmental milestones on schedule , despite his precarious start in life			2
mrs @entity1 said : ' @entity88 loves to help with him			2
i ’m aware that the experience affected the family more than it did me			0
' from my perspective , i went to sleep and woke up following the delivery not feeling very well			0
but my family was told that they might lose me and the baby			0
i ’m glad i did n’t have to go through that stress			0
' we are now looking to the future			0
@entity3 is a little boy who needs all the love and care we can give him , and we are ready to move on in life			2
