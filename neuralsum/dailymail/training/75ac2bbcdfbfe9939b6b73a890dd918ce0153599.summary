@entity0 has dropped anchor again in @entity2 , but the @entity4 owner hopes it is his team who make a splash			1
ever the showman , the 64 - year - old tycoon moored his £ 70million super-yacht at @entity11 , and will watch the @entity4 face the @entity12 at @entity13			1
playing the second of four regular season games , @entity0 was coy about extending the deal beyond 2016			1
@entity0 made a cameo at @entity18 in midweek to watch @entity20 's draw with @entity21 ' i think we ’re going to go through the two more years and then look at it			1
we are a party to a stakeholder			2
and whether this thing is extended the @entity27 has the final say , but it ’s been great and in a couple of years we will look at it , but certainly it has worked out fabulously for the international fans			0
' and really for the @entity4 fans , it ’s been great			2
last year we had 5,000 fans travel over here from @entity4 , which is a great experience for them			1
it ’s in their annual calendar , they get to follow the team to @entity2			0
' with the @entity4 on 1 - 8 , their record is a meagre one			1
once again , @entity0 played his cards close to his chest			2
' i think we have the youngest team in @entity48 , so i think we want to be getting better and better			0
' the wonderful thing about the @entity50 is the competitive balance			0
i feel very good about where we ’re headed , but when it comes to it on any sunday it depends which way the ball bounces , ' he said			0
@entity0 's @entity4 themed yacht , @entity61 , has been turning heads along the @entity63 @entity12 owner @entity64 is a close friend , and paid tribute to @entity0 's business acumen and imagination in midweek			1
and @entity0 was keen to return the compliment			2
' @entity64 is one of the first guys i met ... this is six , seven years ago			0
i was the guy off the street and @entity64 was the iconic @entity73 sports owner , you know , @entity75 winner , etc. etc. ' maybe this is a very @entity73 quality , but he was very welcoming , he showed me how the system works and so on			0
he ’s a special guy and certainly i am very , very fond of him			0

@entity0 owns the @entity4 and @entity20 and will be at @entity13 to see @entity4 face the @entity12
now in his third year of ownership , the 64 - year - old said he may extend the deal to play regular season games in @entity84 beyond 2016
