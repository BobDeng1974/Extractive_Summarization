business leaders have accused @entity1 of seeking to burden firms after the party announced plans to make it easier for employers to be sued			2
last year the @entity7 introduced moves to tackle frivolous employment tribunal cases by making claimants pay an up - front fee			1
but yesterday @entity1 ’s rising star , @entity12 , told the @entity14 conference that he wanted to scrap the fees for many people by introducing a means test			1
@entity1 's business spokesman @entity18 told the @entity14 conference that he wanted to scrap the employment tribunal fees for many people by introducing a means test labour leader @entity22 attended the @entity24 dinner at the @entity25 in @entity26 after his party revealed it is planning to reform the tribunals system @entity22 before the @entity14 dinner - the @entity1 have supported calls for tribunal fees to be reformed fighting cases at employment tribunals currently costs firms an average of £ 8,500			1
since the £ 1,200 fee was introduced , employment tribunal cases have dropped by three - quarters – with sex discrimination cases dropping by 80 per cent and race claims down 60 per cent			1
under the current system , any employee who wins their case will be reimbursed			0
and low - income workers or people who claim certain benefits can apply to have their fee waived			2
the fee can also be lifted if it would prevent the claimant from paying an overdue rent or mortgage payment , if they are threatened with legal action over unpaid bills , or if they are faced with uninsured losses due to fire , flood , theft or criminal damage			0
the fee has been credited with almost destroying the multi-billion pound industry based on vexatious discrimination claims against employers			0
but mr @entity12 , @entity1 ’s business spokesman , revealed that he is planning to reform the tribunals system			1
he made his announcement just hours after the @entity14 general secretary @entity66 demanded that the tribunal fees be scrapped , fuelling concerns that @entity1 is in thrall to the unions			1
miss @entity66 said : ‘ if your boss robs you of holiday pay , why on earth should you have to find more than £ 1,000 to see justice done in an employment tribunal ? it ’s plain wrong that workers are priced out of justice			2
so – and let ’s demand it – we want employment tribunal fees scrapped , once and for all			1
’ only hours later , addressing the @entity14 in @entity26 , mr @entity12 said he wanted to introduce a means test , claiming that the @entity87 ’ system is preventing the poorest employees from upholding their rights in the workplace			1
he said : ‘ we have fought to defend people ’s rights and voice in opposition but these rights are only meaningful if you can get proper redress			0
‘ the current tribunal system is unfair , unsustainable and has resulted in prohibitive costs locking people out of the justice they are entitled to			0
‘ affordability should not be a barrier to workplace justice			0
so if we are elected , the next @entity105 will abolish the current system , reform the employment tribunals and put in place a new system which ensures all workers have proper access to justice			2
’ @entity14 general secretary @entity66 made a speech on sunday calling for tribunal fees to be scrapped but @entity115 , director of policy at the @entity117 , criticised the plans , saying : ‘ claimants on benefits or low incomes are exempt so we do n’t think the fees are a barrier to wronged employees getting compensation			1
’ he added : ‘ before refundable charges were introduced , fewer than one in ten tribunal cases against @entity117 members were won by the claimant , wasting large amounts of money and time for businesses			2
fees are a sensible way to weed out weak or vexatious claims			0
’ and @entity137 , from the @entity138 , said : ‘ firms have been frustrated for years by false and misleading claims that take up time and resources			0
‘ recent reforms which encourage early resolution of disputes are a step in the right direction , and fees to make a claim are a vital part of that			0
’ last night @entity152 business minister @entity151 said : ‘ of course we want to make sure everyone can get justice in the workplace			0
that ’s precisely why we ’re giving waivers to people who ca n’t afford to pay employment tribunal fees			1
’ he added : ‘ these proposals would undermine our record jobs recovery and make it harder for employers to create jobs			0
@entity1 just have n’t learned their lesson			2
