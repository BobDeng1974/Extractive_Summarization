by @entity0 and @entity1 in the quest to make us slimmer without lifting a finger , an injection has been invented letting us literally pee out our fat			0
a water solution is injected into stubborn areas around the body , breaking down excess fat cells , allowing us to absorb them into our bloodstream - and then wee them out			1
the new treatment , dubbed @entity14 , claims to be an effective alternative to liposuction			1
the jabs break fat cells , allowing us to absorb them into our bloodstream - and then wee them out it contains plant polymers , which binds with the cell walls of the fat tissue before rupturing and releasing the fat to be dissolved			1
the formula liquefies the fat cell which is then eliminated when you urinate over a three - week period			1
makers say the solution completely destroys the fat cells so they ca n’t grow back			1
it can be used on your thighs , stomach , knees , chin , buttocks , stomach , back and even your neck			0
describing its new treatment , @entity41 say it ' gives you the body you ’ve always dreamed of without fearing the fat will return '			2
the treatment , which claims to be the only registered fat removal injection on the market , says it has no downtime ( other than slight bruising and swelling for 48 hours )			2
' @entity14 is n’t an injection for weight loss ; it is used for contouring the body and slimming down those stubborn fat areas			1
combined with a healthy diet and exercise , the fat wo n’t grow back either			0
one session costs £ 250 , which @entity41 say is all that 's needed for the chin area , while the tummy may need a few more treatments			0
but is it all too good to be true - can it really be effective and safe ? dr @entity66 , from the private @entity67 in @entity68 says the injections could pose a health risk			0
@entity71 , like lipo , is not recommended for weight loss goals but rather to contour the body he told the @entity75 : ' it 's dangerous to re-absorb fatty acids into your bloodstream because if it 's dissolved down into salt it would send cholesterol levels sky high			1
' dr @entity83 , @entity84 of 111 @entity85 , said : ' i do n’t use fat removal injectable in my clinic and certainly have no plans to until there is further research and trials published			2
' it ’s always important that prospective patients thoroughly research treatments before they book , and these injectables are very new to the market with little evidence of their efficacy other than that produced by the manufacturer			0
' while the cost is certainly affordable and attractive , those thinking of having the procedure must look at alternatives available that have proven results and existing patient testimonials			0
' also , prospective patients must undergo a full consultation to determine the right procedure for their concern			0
' before and after : @entity110 , 42 , from @entity111 had a £ 250 @entity14 injection and slimmed down			2

@entity14 injections liquefy fat which is then eliminated when you urinate
clinic claim absorbed fat cells do not return and there 's no downtime
*critics* say it could spell danger for cholesterol if fat turns to salt in blood
