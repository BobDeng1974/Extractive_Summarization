endometriosis causes inflammation and can lead to female reproductive body parts and other organs fusing together , making it almost impossible for eggs to fertilise naturally , rendering many women infertile			0
@entity0 was one of these women , and had been told she would not be able to fall pregnant naturally			2
it was then that she made the decision to have ivf treatment			2
since then however , she has discovered that some women keep their @entity9 treatment a secret and are embarrassed about it			1
for this reason she took to her blog to highlight the issue			0
@entity0 showed her support for women who were also going through @entity9 treatment the couple 's efforts to have a baby had been unsuccessful because she suffers from @entity40 ' when you are first told that news , you do feel like you ’ve failed the process of being able to bring a child into the world as a “ normal ” mother , ' she explained on her blog			1
' but my thoughts soon shifted to “ but i still have a chance to bring a child into this world and that ’s amazing ” we should not feel embarrassed to have ivf babies			2
' before @entity0 started her own treatment she said she understood why the majority of mothers wanted to keep quiet during the process of @entity9 as it was long , draining , intrusive , emotional , and for some parents , financially hard			1
' but when you are through the battle and are holding your precious baby , you should be happy and proud ... do n’t feel embarrassed to say “ they were born through @entity9 ” you need to realise that science helped you with the end result , ' she said on her blog			2

' and it is you who is going to smother this child with unconditional love and support for the rest of their life and @entity123 is what truly makes you a “ normal ” mother			0
' @entity0 has had to overcome challenges in her life before			2
in december 2012 she was hosting on 2 day @entity130 with fellow dj @entity100 when they posed as the @entity102 and prince @entity103 , and rang the @entity132 hospital where the real life duchess of @entity134 was suffering severe morning sickness with her first child			0
nurse @entity137 who answered the phone and put the call through to the ward took her own life two days later and cited the distress at being fooled as one of the reasons			0
the pair 's call was answered by nurse @entity137 who later committed suicide			0
she cited the stress caused by the prank as one of the reasons why she took her own life however , after coming to terms with the tragedy and fallout from it , @entity0 is ready to take on the next challenge that life has thrown at her - the daunting prospect of @entity9 treatment			1
' as i sit here loading up my first syringe i ’m thinking , “ i hope i do this right			0
if my doctor does n’t answer which friend can i call to ask for advice ? ” women help each other , it ’s what we do , ' she blogged			0
' but how can we do that if we do n’t know who to ask for help ? support networks are so important			0
i will share as much of this journey as i can , through the pain , heartache , joy ... and i hope i do n’t feel the need to keep it private too			0
@entity0 has had great support from her husband @entity183 ( right ) as she starts her @entity9 program ' if you are a part of this elite club and you know someone going through @entity9 , maybe take that first step and privately reach out letting them know you too have membership and you are there for them if they need someone			1
