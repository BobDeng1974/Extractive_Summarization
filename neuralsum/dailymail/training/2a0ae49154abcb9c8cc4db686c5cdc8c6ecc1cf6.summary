by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 2 july 2013 a free - running daredevil has filmed his incredible leaps from vertigo - inducing heights using a headcam			1
adrenaline junkie @entity5 gives online viewers an incredible first - person view of his death - defying stunts , filmed from the rooftops of @entity10			1
in one video , the 22 - year - old edges along a narrow ledge before leaping across a 14ft gap between two three - storey buildings from a standing start			1
here we see him balance on a ledge moments before he leaps ... mid-flight : the incredible perspective the videos provide has won mr @entity5 a legion of online fans he then effortlessly bounds across the tops of other buildings using a free - running technique known as parkour			1
the video of his exploits , filmed on a headcam , have already clocked up 140,000 views online			0
last month mr @entity5 had another viral video hit of himself dangling one - handed from a 250ft - tall crane in his native @entity40			1
no fear : the daredevil climber leaps from rooftop to rooftop and dangles above the city streets compared to that , he said , his run across the roofs at @entity10 was ' just another day in the park '			1
but his antics have angered @entity50 who say he was trespassing on many of their buildings			0
but @entity5 and parkour partner @entity55 , 21 , insist they do no harm and ca n't understand the people who try to stop them			1
@entity5 , who started ' free - running ' six years ago , said : ' i 've got quite a few good friends in @entity10 , and the rooftops there are the best in the whole @entity65 for what i do			1
' it had always been in our minds to go there and shoot something , so i finally did			0
' as for the jump at the beginning , i did n't even need to prepare because there was no doubt in my mind that i 'd make it			2
' i 've trained hard , so i know what i can do , and for me it 's just another jump , just another day in the park			0
' i 've heard a lot of stories of people training in @entity10 and being stopped			0
i do n't know what makes some people hate free - running so much			1
' perhaps it 's because they think we do n't know what we 're doing and are causing damage			2
' some people ca n't understand it and therefore are afraid of it and want to get rid of it as soon as they can			2
' i 'm not reckless , i care about what i 'm doing and we 're careful not to damage the buildings we 're on			0
' a spokesman for @entity50 said @entity5 was endangering himself and others			1
he said : ' not only is it trespassing , but endangering public health and their own health			0
' we would not encourage the activities from the video in any way			0
' leap of faith : the free - runner 's shadow is captured mid-jump by the sun controversial sport : mr @entity5 and his fellow climber @entity55 , 21 , insist they do no harm , and ca n't understand the people who try to stop them the thrill - seeker claims @entity10 's rooftops are ' the best in the whole @entity65 ' for free - running motion blur : here he is seen leaping a gap and grasping onto a ledge he said : ' i was n't scared			1
you ca n't afford to be scared when you 're hanging by your fingertips			2
i did it for the adventure ' @entity5 has also completed other hair - raising stunts on tall structures in @entity133 and @entity134			1
last month he played down his stunt with the crane and said he climbed the structure as a way of living life to the full			2

you ca n't afford to be scared when you 're hanging by your fingertips			0

' ' i did n't go up there to die			2
i went up there to live			0

*fearless* @entity5 , 22 , captures his hair - raising *acrobatics* on camera
the thrill - seeker leaps sheer drops and dangles *precariously* from a crane
but *university* *officials* say he is a danger to himself and others
the free - runner said : ' i did n't go up there to die . i went up there to live '
