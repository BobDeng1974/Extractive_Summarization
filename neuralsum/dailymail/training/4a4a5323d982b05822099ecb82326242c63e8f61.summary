but not as you know it foie gras with truffle sauce , monkfish liver with pancetta jus ...			2
we 've heard of haute cuisine , now it 's time for ' oat cuisine '			2
think of the word porridge and you will probably remember the steaming pile of @entity17 served up to keep you warm on the journey to school			2
but rather unexpectedly , this most solid of cereals has become a gourmet dish			0
top @entity25 chef @entity23 is championing an exotic range of recipes that use the @entity29 oats as their base			1
she calls her approach @entity33			0
abandoning traditional toppings such as honey and milk , she serves porridge with pesto sauce , pumpkin puree and bacon			2
the menu includes @entity43 spiced oatmeal with raisins , sliced almonds , coconut milk , crystallised ginger , cardamom , vanilla and brown sugar ; and @entity52 oatmeal served with bacon , cheddar cheese , roasted apples , maple syrup and sea salt			1
but there 's no need to travel to @entity25 to partake in the @entity33 trend			0
porridge is so simple to make that anyone can experiment with unconventional ingredients			0
flavours that suit risotto tend to work well with porridge			0
so how about a bowl of mushroom , parmesan and pancetta porridge for breakfast tomorrow ? flavours which work well with risotto also work with oats who said porridge was boring ? originally from @entity77 , @entity23 now lives in @entity25 where she oatmeals , the cosy dining room in which she puts ' modern twists on an old - fashioned wholesome favourite '			1
her idea for gourmet porridge stemmed from being an impoverished student looking for ways of spicing up cheap oats			0
these days , from her pretty perch on 3rd street , @entity87 uses her colourful imagination to conjure up ideas both sweet and savoury for warming , comforting , health - giving bowls of oatiny goodness			1
some of the most decadent sounding concoctions served in @entity96 are the @entity97 - made from a pumpkin pur√©e swirl , pecans , brown sugar , pumpkin spice and whole milk - the @entity103 , flaky sea salt , cracked pepper , bacon topping recommended - and the the @entity108 - diced ham , gruyere cheese , nutmeg , steamed milk			1
the squidgy treats can also be made to order with ingredients including @entity114 , carob chips , chia seesds , butterscotch chips , truffle oil , agave nectar , ginger , mini-marshmallows , pineapple and pesto			0
though we do recommend you do n't try them out all at once			0
