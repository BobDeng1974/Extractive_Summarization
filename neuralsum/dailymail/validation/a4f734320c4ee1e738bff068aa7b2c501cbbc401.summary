grassroots clubs are missing out on millions of pounds from the transfer of their former players			1
that is the fear of @entity5 chairman , @entity4			1
his club benefited from the £ 2million transfer of @entity9 from @entity10 to @entity11 in 2012 and have now landed another payment in light of his £ 10m move to @entity16 in august			1
the windfall is all part of the ‘ solidarity contribution ’ mechanism set out in the @entity20 on the @entity21			0
@entity16 goalkeeper @entity9 was formerly registered with @entity5 @entity5 is one of the country ’s most famous talent factories and had the likes of @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 on their books but because junior clubs have to make an application for their entitlement to the buying club within 18 months of the deal , @entity4 believes that millions could be going unclaimed by junior clubs worldwide			1
‘ i 'd query how many junior clubs are actually aware of the regulations and what they could be entitled to , ’ he told @entity37			0
‘ it 's always great to see former players go on to bigger things and everyone at the club is absolutely delighted to see @entity9 playing at the top of the game , we all wish him well			2
‘ at the same time , if the clubs which played a part in his early career can benefit in some small way from his move , this makes a huge difference to the young people we look after week in , week out			0
’ @entity58 were entitled to payment from the transfer of @entity9 from @entity10 to @entity11 in 2012 and from @entity11 to @entity16 last summer because the deals were made between different football associations @entity10 and @entity63 striker @entity27 played for @entity5 before joining @entity16 's academy @entity5 chairman @entity4 fears grassroots clubs could be missing out millions by not claiming money they are entitled to @entity68 clubs only receive the payment when a player moves between clubs registered in different football associations ( ie international transfers ) and a fee is involved , as was the case with @entity9 when he swapped @entity76 for @entity63 last month			1
it does not apply to domestic deals			0
five per cent of every transfer fee between clubs in different associations is set aside to be distributed to any club – including professional - to which the player was registered between the seasons of their 12th and 23rd birthdays			1
the amount received is proportional to the time spent under their care , which is recorded on a ‘ player passport ’			0
for example , if a £ 10m player spent just one season at a junior club they would land around £ 25,000			2
going forward , it could be an invaluable source of future income for the likes of @entity58 , who had @entity63 goalkeeper @entity9 on their books until he joined @entity10 at 15			2
the club is one of the country ’s most famous talent factories and more than 70 of their youngsters have gone on to play professionally , including @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity108 and @entity109			0
a young @entity29 pictured at @entity5 in 1994 and , of their famed alumni , @entity4 added : ‘ unfortunately , not many of them played abroad ! ‘ it 's increasingly hard for grassroots clubs at all levels to raise funds each year , so if any are fortunate enough to have a player transfer internationally in these circumstances later in his career , it is important to bear this in mind			1
‘ @entity58 is a registered charity so most of our income is still from donations , but i hope more junior clubs can benefit from similar situations in future			0
’ any @entity132 club which thinks it may be missing out can call the @entity132 's free legal helpline on 0191 2117799 or email @entity134 .			0
