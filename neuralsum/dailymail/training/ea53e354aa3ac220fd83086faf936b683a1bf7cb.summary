by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 03:55 est , 16 september 2013 seventeen soldiers , including two sergeant majors , face being discharged from the @entity3 after being caught using performance - enhancing drugs in the @entity5 ’ biggest reported case of doping			1
the soldiers , from the 7th @entity9 ( 7 @entity10 ) , failed a compulsory drugs test after they used a sports supplement containing the restricted substance ephedrine , a stimulant which has similar effects to the @entity17 drug amphetamine , such as an increased heart rate and dizziness			1
the soldiers , who follow an arduous physical training regime , are understood to have claimed they took the ephedrine – an ingredient in a type of bodybuilding product called ‘ fat stripper ’ – unwittingly			1
trouble : the soldiers , who follow an arduous physical training regime , are understood to have claimed they took the ephedrine - an ingredient in a type of bodybuilding product called ' fat stripper ' - unwittingly the drug is available legally as a prescription medicine but is also contained in unlicensed sports supplements sold online			1
according to defence sources , the regiment ’s commanding officer is now weighing up the cost of losing 17 soldiers against his obligation to the @entity3 ’s ‘ zero - tolerance ’ drugs policy			1
the shamed soldiers were among 400 members of 7 @entity10 tested at @entity45 , @entity46 , at the end of august			1
the test was apparently timed to identify those who had consumed illegal substances during the regiment ’s summer holidays			0
urine samples for all personnel were examined for recreational substances such as heroin , cocaine and cannabis			0
the 17 soldiers facing expulsion fell foul of additional tests for controlled substances such as ephedrine			1
urine samples for all personnel were examined for recreational substances such as heroin , cocaine and cannabis as well as other drugs like ephedrine according to @entity73 guidelines , any serviceman or woman found to have taken banned drugs can expect to be discharged			2
however , in exceptional circumstances , a commanding officer may choose a more lenient punishment and remedial training			0
last night a regimental source said the drugs test results had shocked all the members of 7 @entity10			1
he said : ‘ we expected maybe five or six fails			0
that ’s pretty standard , especially when they test us straight after @entity85 or summer leave			0
but 17 is off the charts , and for a pair of sergeant majors to get done too is unheard of			0
‘ these guys are gym rats rather than recreational drug users , and they ’re guilty of being stupid for not checking what was in the fat - stripper product , but that ’s all			2
' a warning needs to be sent across the @entity3 about the dangers of these products			2
a lot of guys are pumping iron and overdoing it			0
they could pay a high price			0
’ an @entity73 spokesman said last night : ‘ the @entity5 have a zero - tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviour , including substance misuse			2
' where an individual is found , through compulsory drug testing or other investigation , to have fallen short of the @entity112 ’ high standards , they will be dealt with through the military discipline process			0
