surgeons have used @entity1 in a @entity3 operating theatre for the first time in the @entity3			1
the voice - activated glasses , which feature a tiny display above the wearer ’s eyes , can record video and live - stream operations via the internet			1
@entity12 , an orthopaedic surgeon at @entity13 in @entity14 , became the first surgeon in the @entity3 to use @entity1 through an operation			1
@entity12 , an orthopaedic surgeon at @entity13 , in @entity14 , has become the first surgeon in the @entity3 to perform an operation while wearing @entity1 @entity1 has since been used by surgeons across the hospital , including in a variety of orthopaedic procedures and ear , nose and throat operations			1
dr @entity25 , core surgical trainee and app inventor at the hospital , managed to acquire a set of @entity1 last november , before the official launch in the @entity3			2
@entity13 says the technology has ‘ huge potential ’ for medical education , with students in a lecture theatre able to see and hear from the surgeon ’s viewpoint			1
@entity1 enables users to access functions including maps , voice search , video calls and email , calendar and photos hands - free			0
‘ the device itself is effectively a smartphone , head - mounted video camera and computer rolled into one , with an eye - level screen , ’ dr @entity25 said			0
‘ what ’s exciting for medical education is that it allows surgeons to record and share their direct view of the surgical field			0
this gives huge potential for mentoring and conferencing			2
since mr @entity12 ( right ) carried out an operation wearing the glasses other surgeons at the hospital have also tried them			2
the hospital says they could be a fantastic teaching tool as they allow operations to be filmed meaning students can see surgery from the surgeon 's perspective ‘ if , for example , you were performing a rare or complex procedure , you could seek the advice of experts anywhere across the globe while operating			1
‘ the device would also enable consultants to mentor junior surgeons through a procedure , extending their hands - on learning			0
‘ @entity86 procedures could be streamed to lecture theatres full of students , giving them virtually the full field of vision the surgeon sees			1
' before using @entity1 in theatre , surgeons talk to their patients about the project and how footage will be used			0
they must give their signed consent before any filming			0
‘ two of the key issues we have had to address while using @entity1 in the operating theatre are patient confidentiality and privacy , ’ mr @entity12 said			2
‘ we take these matters very seriously and have been using the past six months as a trial period to address the issues while still aiming to get the very best from the potential that this technology has to offer within surgical education			0
the hospital says the main difficulty it has had in using @entity1 in operations is ensuring patient confidentiality and privacy is maintained ‘ we have been investigating the ability to stream and store video to a secure network that can only be accessed by those with the relevant consent , and while we ca n’t currently use @entity1 to connect and stream to the internet , we are just about to start live - streaming to junior doctors and medical students within the @entity123			1
’ surgeons are currently exploring a number of technical challenges , such as how to be explicit about when the camera is filming and when it is switched off			0
they are also working out how to upload footage of longer procedures without crashing the computer ’s memory			0
dr @entity132 , consultant anaesthetist and associate medical director for innovation and improvement at the hospital , said : ‘ the trialling of @entity1 here is a perfect example of how innovative practitioners such as @entity25 are being encouraged to look at leading - edge technologies and assess whether we can use them in a way which would add to the quality of care for people in our area			2

@entity12 , at @entity13 , was first surgeon in @entity3 to use the device
other surgeons at the same @entity14 hospital have now used them too
they say @entity1 has ' huge potential ' for medical eduction
it can be used to live - stream operations to lecture theatres so students can see them from the surgeon 's perspective
