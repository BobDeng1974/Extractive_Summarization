the incident happened last october as @entity2 towed the family caravan from her home in @entity29 to a campsite in @entity31 , near @entity32 , @entity33 , for a weekend break with her boyfriend , mother and sister			1
as she drove along @entity39 her caravan hit the kerb , causing two wheels to be ripped off , at about 3.45pm , @entity38 heard at a trial earlier this month			1
she called out a mechanic but when he arrived an hour later he realised she was drunk when he smelt alcohol on @entity2 ' breath and saw her holding a tumbler of spirits			1
@entity47 , prosecuting , said : ' the mechanic saw her sitting in the passenger - side seat of her car with the keys in the ignition but the engine was not running			2
' she seemed not fully with it and when she spoke again , he smelt alcohol on her breath			0
he saw her struggling towards the caravan and coming out carrying a tumbler containing about two - and - a - half inches of clear liquid			2
' he asked her to give him the glass			0
he smelt the liquid , realised that it was some sort of spirit			0
he threw it on the ground and called the police			2
' miss @entity47 said @entity2 was struggling for balance when the police officer arrived			1
she was also said to be struggling to keep her eyes open or hold a conversation			0
no previous convictions : @entity2 , with bag , is shown arriving at @entity73 the prosecutor added : ' she nearly fell over , she had to hold on to the police officer for balance			1
' @entity78 @entity77 told the court : ' she basically fell out of the car			0
she was unsteady on her feet and we had to hold her up to make sure she did n't fall over and hurt herself			0
' the police officer had been so concerned about her condition he took her to accident and emergency at @entity87 - but she was diagnosed as being drunk and was discharged when nothing else was found to be wrong with her			1
an inital breath test showed @entity2 to be just over the legal limit but tests taken at the police station two hours after the crash showed she had 146mg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath			1

home : @entity2 admitted having two @entity9 and @entity104 before setting out from @entity29 to @entity31 the court had heard how in an interview the day after the smash , @entity2 said she had been travelling on holiday when her caravan wobbled and swerved , so she pulled into the next lay - by			1
she said she could n't remember the mechanic attending the scene			2
@entity2 told police she had had coffee and a biscuit at 10am before drinking two @entity9 and cokes at around 12 noon			1
she said her high breath test must have been influenced by what she drank after she crashed outside the @entity119 pub in @entity120			2
there was no alcohol in the caravan , although there was a bottle of rum found - which she said must have been from a previous trip			2
during her trial on january 15 , @entity2 claimed that she had drunk most of a bottle of rum whilst she waited for the mechanic because she was devastated at damaging the caravan , which she said was her and her boyfriend 's ' pride and joy			1

she insisted she was under the limit when she was driving			0

he added : ' it is a low level of seriousness - there was no accident , there seems to be some sort of collision but no evidence that a collision took place			0
there were no other vehicles involved in the incident or any pedestrians			0
' her children are reliant on their mother - it will impact her financially which could potentially see her losing her home			1
' but @entity169 , chairwoman of the bench , said : ' this was an extremely high reading			0
' your car was towing a caravan and was involved in an accident and an aggravating feature of this case was the time of day at which there was a high level of traffic about on the busy road			0

there was a potential harm to other road users			0
