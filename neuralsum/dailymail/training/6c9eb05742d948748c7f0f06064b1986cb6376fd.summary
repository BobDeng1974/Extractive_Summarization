smoking should be outlawed in public parks , the chief medical officer said last night			1
@entity2 claimed a ban was needed to stop children being set a bad example			2
campaigners immediately denounced the idea as an attack on personal liberties			2
they said it could be the start of a slippery slope leading to a total ban – even in homes			2
the peer calls for mr @entity20 to use his powers as mayor to ensure 20,000 acres of parks in @entity28 go smoke - free			1
the ban would even extend to @entity30 and possibly nationwide because @entity21 said it would be a blueprint for the whole of @entity32			1
@entity33 said it was dangerous for children to see adults smoking in parks because they might decide to copy them			0
‘ we all know smoking is bad for health , ’ she said			2
‘ so i welcome any measures to reduce both active smoking and its role - modelling in front of children			2
’ but @entity46 , of the @entity47 , said : ‘ this is an outrageous attack on personal freedom – a slippery slope on the path to banning smoking altogether			2
park : people lighting up in public encourages children , the report said ( picture posed by model ) ‘ politicians must avoid this heavy - handed interference in the lives of ordinary people			1
’ and @entity63 , of the smokers ’ group @entity64 , said : ‘ a ban on smoking in open air parks would be outrageous			1
' there ’s no health risk to anyone other than the smoker			0
if you do n’t like the smell , walk away			1
‘ the next thing will be a ban on smoking in our own gardens in case a whiff of smoke travels over the fence			2
‘ the anti-smoking bandwagon is becoming farcical			0
it ’s sad to see the mayor of @entity28 encouraging such nonsense			1
’ mr @entity20 said the proposal should spark public debate			0
‘ one of the glories of @entity28 is that we are generally pretty laissez - faire about how people live their lives – provided they do not break the law and provided they do no harm to others , ’ he said			1
‘ if we were to consider a ban on smoking in parks , we would need pretty clear evidence that this would have direct health benefits – in other words , that it would actually save lives			0
it is time for @entity28 to have that debate			1
’ the government ’s public health quango backed the idea of smoke - free parks			1
@entity110 , who heads the alcohol , drugs and tobacco division of @entity32 , said : ‘ parks and outdoor spaces should be healthy environments for people of all ages			0
smoke - free outdoor spaces will help de-normalise smoking in our society by reducing the number of smoking role models for children			0
’ professor @entity124 , director of tobacco studies at @entity125 , said : ‘ i would expect it to save lives by reducing reminders of smoking in those who are trying to quit and providing more incentive to stop			0
‘ i hope most smokers would see this as a positive step			0
’ optimistic : the report for @entity20 aims to turn @entity28 into a healthier capital ( picture posed by models ) 2002 - @entity139 on all tobacco advertising and sponsorship 2007 - smoking ban in public places such as bars and restaurants in @entity32 2008 - introduction of graphic images on cigarette packets 2011 - @entity139 on tobacco vending machines 2013 - @entity139 on display of cigarettes in shops starts to be rolled out 2014 - @entity153 votes to ban the smoking of cigarettes in cars when children are present the future - government is considering mandatory plain cigarette packages @entity21 ’s report , called @entity161 for @entity28 , calls for a range of measures to improve the health of people in the capital – leading to a ‘ healthier , slimmer , fitter city ’			1
it called for mandatory traffic - light labelling on restaurant menus , public transport discounts for those who walk for a substantial part of their journey to work and restrictions on junk food outlets near schools			1
councils with a particular alcohol problem should also use their licensing powers to introduce a minimum unit price of 50p			0
this final recommendation would be seen as a challenge from the @entity28 mayor to @entity186			1
the government has so far declined to introduce minimum pricing			0
@entity21 said mr @entity20 should use his powers over @entity30 and @entity190 to ensure they go smoke free			2
he should also use his influence over the @entity195 , the board of which he appoints			0
this would take in @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203			0
town halls would be encouraged to do the same in the parks they control			0
it is hoped cities and towns up and down the country would follow suit			0
‘ the ideas and proposals in this report have been developed for @entity28 , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ yet they could just as easily apply to other big cities in the @entity218			2
' hundreds of children take up smoking every week – two classrooms - full a day in @entity28			1
once they start they continue , since cigarettes are more powerfully addictive than narcotics			0
' we know smoking is bad for health , ' said @entity33 , ' so i welcome any measures to reduce role modelling ' ‘ it ’s little surprise that in places where more adults smoke , more children begin smoking too			0
@entity28 should lead the way for @entity218 , and the mayor should lead the way for @entity28 by acting to make our public spaces smoke free			1
’ asked how smoke - free parks would be policed , @entity21 said 98 per cent of people abided by the ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants which was introduced in july 2007			1
‘ i do n’t see the necessity of having wardens walking around the parks , ’ he said			2
‘ the evidence will suggest that our nation does abide with the laws			0
we just need very clear signs			0
’ the plan was welcomed by @entity256 , the former mayor of @entity257 , where smoking is already banned in all parks			0
he said : ‘ @entity28 ’s plan will help prevent children from picking up the habit , discourage adults from smoking , and improve the health of children and families			2
‘ i look forward to visiting @entity28 ’s smoke - free parks and squares , and i ’m certain that millions of others will as well			1
’ @entity271 , of the anti-smoking charity ash , said : ‘ @entity28 needs to do more to tackle smoking , which is the major cause of preventable premature death in the capital			1
’ a source close to health secretary @entity278 said he was not considering extending smoking bans to public parks , though @entity28 and local authorities could act independently to implement their own measures			1
@entity21 is a cancer surgeon at @entity283 in @entity284 .			0

chief medical officer @entity286 suggests ban in new report
it would cover some 20,000 acres of @entity28 *including* @entity30
rules could be widened across @entity218 - but were *condemned* by campaigners
