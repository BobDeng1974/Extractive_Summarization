@entity1 's second autobiography was always going to be a read that opened up old wounds , unsettling former team - mates and managers alike			1
the former @entity8 captain had sir @entity9 , the class of ' 92 and @entity11 in his sights - among a raft of others - but also contextualised various moments of a controversial career			1
here , @entity17 takes a look at the highlights of @entity20 - released this thursday			1
@entity21 assistant manager @entity1 is all set to release his second autobiography this week the former @entity8 captain wrote of problems with goalkeeper @entity24 @entity1 could n't understand why @entity11 was questioning loyalty at @entity8 keane with a @entity28 kit on and ( right ) sharing a joke with ex-goalkeeper @entity30 sir @entity9 claps the @entity32 crowd after beating @entity1 's @entity33 in september 2007 the class of ' 92 all good players but their role at the club has been exaggerated			1
the class of ’ 92 seems to have grown its own legs			2
it has become a brand			2
it ’s as if they were a team away from a team and they are not shy of plugging in to it			2
@entity44 @entity44 was a top top player but i still do n’t fall for the boy next door image			2
or that he ’s dead humble			2
he has more of an edge to him			2
everyone thinks he lives in a council flat			2
fighting @entity24 i had a bust - up with @entity24 when we were on a preseason tour of @entity54 , in 1998 , just after i came back from my cruciate injury			1
i think we were in @entity56			2
there 'd been a little bit of tension between us over the years , for football reasons			0
there was a lot of noise - @entity24 's a big lad			1
i woke up the next morning			0
i kind of vaguely remembered the fight			0
my hand was really sore and one of my fingers was bent backwards			0
@entity24 had grabbed me , i 'd headbutted him			0
we 'd been fighting for ages			0
@entity1 walking through the driving rain at @entity74 against @entity75 in february 2004 regrets apologising to @entity9 does not regret his tackle on @entity78 told @entity9 ' we need f * * * * * * more ' would n't have missed a drugs test like @entity81 @entity82 @entity24 class of 92 @entity84 regret @entity9 wanted me to wear no 7 turned down @entity87 this summer re-opens feud with @entity9 leaving @entity32 it was another little hand grenade they threw at me			1
not an hour later , or two hours , or after the severance negotiations - it was already written			1
i said to @entity9 “ can i play for somebody else ? ” and he said , “ yeah you can , cos we ’re tearing up your contract ” so i thought , “ all right - i ’ll get fixed up ”			1
i knew there ’d be clubs in for me when the news got out			0
i said , “ yeah - i think we have come to the end ”			1
i just thought , “ f * * * * * * p * * * * ” and i stood up and went “ yeah			1
that @entity107 interview it was getting a bit silly so i got the players together in the dressing room and told them it was f * * * * * g nonsense			1
' they were all going : ‘ yeah , yeah ’			0
not one of them had an issue			0
sir @entity9 vs @entity118 i put @entity118 ahead of @entity9			1
i think with sir @entity9 it was pure business - everything is business			1
if he was being nice i would think : “ this is business , this ”			0
he was driven and ruthless			0
that lack of warmth was his strength			0
@entity11 questioning his loyalty do n’t you f * * * * * * talk to me about loyalty , @entity131			1
you left this club after 12 months a few years ago for the @entity84 job			0
@entity8 's downturn i look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better			1
not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best			2
looking at what happened to @entity141 , i can only conclude that he did n’t have a strong dressing room			0
he had a weak dressing room			0
feud with @entity9 @entity1 reveals he said to @entity9 : ‘ you as well gaffer			1
we need f * * * * * * more from you			1
we need a bit more , gaffer			0
we ’re slipping behind other teams			0
' @entity1 stands over @entity152 after a shocking challenge in the @entity155 derby at @entity32 @entity1 confronts @entity157 's @entity156 during @entity160 's 2 - 1 @entity159 defeat at @entity161 @entity9 's relationship deteriorated with the @entity163 international before he left for @entity87 @entity1 writes about a range of topic in his @entity167 @entity152 i did want to nail him and let him know what was happening			1
i wanted to hurt him and stand over him and go : ' @entity170 , you c -- t. ' i do n't regret that			0
but i had no wish to injure him			0
@entity175 he suffered for it and so did the team			0
if it had been me , and the doctor had said i had to do a drugs test , i 'd have gone and done it			0
it was n't something i 'd have forgotten			0
almost moving to @entity84 @entity185 [ @entity184 - his agent ] had given me a heads - up that @entity187 would be phoning , so i took my mobile phone everywhere with me			2
and - how 's your luck - he rang me while i was sitting on the toilet			1
he said : " look @entity1 , we 'll be glad to have you			1
" the club 's board just had to sanction the deal			2
in hindsight , i should have said to myself : ' go , go to @entity198 , live there for a year and a half , learn the language , learn the culture @entity1 : @entity20 , published by @entity202 £ 20			1
