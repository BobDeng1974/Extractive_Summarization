by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 05:46 est , 15 april 2013 never seen before pictures of a two - headed shark have been revealed by an @entity4 fisherman			1
@entity5 was working as a longline fisherman in the @entity7 when a pregnant blue shark was hauled aboard somewhere between 200 and 900 miles off @entity9 in september , 2008			1
when he cut open the creature , the freak foetus was discovered inside			2
he decided to share the photographs after scientists confirmed the discovery of a different two - headed bull shark foetus , off the coast of @entity17			1
never seen before pictures of a two headed shark have been revealed by an @entity4 fisherman @entity5 , a former longline fisherman , discovered the shark foetus inside a pregnant blue shark was hauled in on september 27 , 2008 it was the first time the condition had ever been recorded in a bull shark			1
the former commercial fisherman , currently a fishing guide for royals in @entity28 , contacted @entity29 to share the photos			2
unlike the two - headed bull shark , the two heads on the blue shark foetus are separated completely in a freak of nature			1
he told @entity29 that fishermen often cut open pregnant sharks because they are only allowed to keep 20 blue sharks on a boat at a time , including foetal ones			0
he said that normally when they cut open a pregnant blue shark there could be almost a hundred pups in there			2
he said : ' we toss them in the water and they usually swim off fine			0
i cut open quite a few and that was the only strange one i ever saw			0
' while there have been only about a half dozen reported cases of two - headed sharks , the condition has been seen in a number of animals , including human beings			1
it occurs when the embryo does not finish splitting into twins , in the same process which produces conjoined twins			1
experts said had the two - headed shark been born , it would not have survived since it would n’t be able to swim away from predators			1
it comes after scientists confirmed the discovery of a two - headed bull shark foetus - which at the time was believed to be the world 's first ever			1
it was found in the @entity77 , by a fisherman when he opened the uterus of an adult shark mri scans of the shark revealed two distinct heads , hearts and stomachs			1
the rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail the condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly , with two - headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly			2
but the creatures rarely live beyond a few months			0
each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain , and they share control of the organs and limbs , though the specific structure of the connections varies			0
such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion , with the brains ' arguing ' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig - zag without getting anywhere			2
in snakes , each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other			0
he said : ' i did n’t think it was that special but apparently it is			0
it looked like it had one dorsal fin and one umbilical cord			0
it had teeth like normal pups			0
' the single bullshark - with two heads - was found in the @entity77 , according to a study by @entity126 and reported in the @entity127			1
it was discovered by a fisherman when he opened the uterus of an adult shark in 2011 , around a year after the deepwater horizon oil spill , in the @entity77			1
while other species of sharks have been born with two heads - including blue sharks and tope sharks - this is the first record of it in a bull shark			1
bull sharks are one of only a few species of shark that attacks humans , and are also popular with fisherman , as they put up a ' good fight '			2
@entity149 , @entity126 assistant professor of fisheries and wildlife , told the @entity152 : ' they 're hardy little critters			0
' but despite this , the two - headed specimen probably would have died after birth			1
it was near - to - term , but should have been a lot larger – the body looks to have invested so much energy in growing a separate head that the rest of the body was foreshortened			2
' most of the two - headed creatures shortly after birth , and in this case the creature died shortly after it was discovered , mr @entity149 said there were many more cases of two - headed lizards and snakes , because they are often bred in captivity where breeders can observe and monitor the oddities			1
after it was discovered , the shark was taken to the marine science department at @entity178 and then to @entity126 ’s campu where mr @entity149 and his team used magnetic resonance imagining ( @entity182 ) to study it			0
they revealed two distinct heads , hearts and stomachs			0
the rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail			0
while the professor noted in his research that some may link the deformed shark to exposure to pollutants , to link it to the @entity197 oil spill would be ' unwarranted '			0
he added : ' we simply have no evidence to support that cause or any other			0
' according to the @entity202 , there were 80 instances of unprovoked shark attack against humans in 2012 , with seven deaths .			0

@entity5 found creature in adult shark uterus in @entity7
photos revealed after discovery of a different two - headed bull shark , @entity17
occurs when embryo does *n't* split *fully* - same as in human conjoined twins
