@entity0 is set to officially name @entity1 as the source of the recent cyber attack which has exposed massive volumes of internal company data and shut down its computer systems for a week			1
the results of an investigation into the attack , currently being carried out by @entity12 's @entity11 forensics unit , are expected to be announced later this week			1
on wednesday , two unnamed sources close to the investigation told re / code that the tools used by the hackers are similar to those used in attacks conducted against @entity19 by @entity1			1
culprit ? @entity0 is set to name @entity1 as the source of the recent cyber attack which has exposed massive volumes of internal company data and shut down its computer systems for a week there has been speculation that the attack could be payback on @entity0 for @entity26 , a @entity27 and @entity28 movie about a plot to kill the reclusive state 's leader , @entity31 , that is out on christmas day			1
earlier this week , a @entity1 spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say ' wait and see ' when asked if @entity37 was involved			1
' the hostile forces are relating everything to the @entity1 ( @entity1 )			2
i kindly advise you to just wait and see , ' a spokesman for @entity1 's @entity44 mission			1
@entity1 routinely refers to the @entity45 and @entity19 as hostile forces			1
the @entity47 is also investigating the incident			0
a @entity1 spokesperson said ' wait and see ' on monday when asked if @entity37 was involved in the attack on @entity0 just a month before its planned release of @entity26 , staring @entity28 and @entity27 launched last week , the attack forced employees of the movie studio to shut down computers and work with pen and paper			1
later , sensitive files including employee salary data , product plans and video files of five motion pictures - including the remake of @entity64 and @entity67 's critically acclaimed @entity66 movie , @entity68 - were leaked to the internet			1
personnel information including staff salaries and personal emails were also leaked			0
@entity1 complained to the @entity44 in june about the interview , accusing the @entity45 of sponsoring terrorism and committing an act of war by allowing production of the movie			1
the @entity37 government denounced the film as ' undisguised sponsoring of terrorism , as well as an act of war ' in a letter to @entity44 @entity84 ban ki - moon			0
cars enter @entity87 headquarters in @entity88 , @entity89			0
a cybersecurity expert has raised the possibility that the cyberattack on @entity87 was not the work of @entity1 ' i personally do n't care if ( the movie 's ) disrespectful to @entity31 because he 's evil			1
but that 's not the intent , ' tweeted @entity98 on sunday			0
' @entity1 has produced tons of propaganda films that portray @entity45 's destruction			1
' but cybersecurity expert @entity102 has told the @entity103 that he finds it hard to believe that @entity1 is the perpetrator and instead thinks it is more probable that it was the actions of an employee or ex-employee with administrative access privileges			2
for the studio - which has laid off hundreds of employees over the past year in an effort to contain costs - the possibility of a disgruntled employee wreaking havoc is very real			0
' if terabytes of data left the @entity0 networks , their network detection systems would have noticed easily , ' said @entity102			1
' it would also take months for a hacker to figure out the topography of the @entity0 networks to know where critical assets are stored and to have access to the decryption keys needed to open up the screeners that have been leaked			2
' @entity0 workers saw a message appear on computer screens saying ' hacked by # @entity132 ' - understood to be the initials of a group called @entity135 which has been linked to @entity1 in addition , he said , ' it is possible that @entity1 - sponsored hackers were working with someone on the inside			1
but it is more likely a ruse to shift blame , knowing the distaste the @entity1 regime has for @entity87			2
' @entity87 ' computer system went down last monday after the cyber attack			1
before screens went dark , they displayed a red skull and the phrase ' hacked by # @entity132 , ' which reportedly stands for @entity135			0
the hackers also warned they would release ' secrets ' stolen from @entity0			2
the data released so far from the apparently leaked documents has already been damaging - it revealed all the top executives at @entity87 are white and male , raising questions about control of @entity163 's film output			2
staff at @entity0 are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never - ending slew of @entity167 movies the company is producing staff at @entity0 are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never - ending slew of @entity167 movies the company is producing , according to information released following last week ’s cyber attack			1
an un-encrypted text file titled ‘ @entity172 ’ has been released which features a long list of negative employee feedback – and @entity167 ’s name is a reoccurring theme			0
the comedian ’s company , @entity179 , has been responsible for 25 films released by @entity0 over the past 15 years including @entity178 , @entity177 , @entity182 and @entity183			2
these movies turn a profit but are shown little love from the critics and from @entity0 staff it would appear			2
here are some of the comments featured in the leaked document : other criticism from staff was equally as cutting even if the target was n't quite so specific : @entity167 movies such as @entity195 regularly turn a profit for @entity0 but rarely win over the critics or staff a leaked memo has revealed a spreadsheet said to show the salaries of 6,000 @entity87 employees , including top executives , reveals that of 17 earning $ 1 million or more a year , just two are not white and just one is a woman			2
the list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site fusion			0
@entity210 , reporting for @entity211 , who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source , said : ' when i sorted the list by ' annual rate , ' i noticed something notable : a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most			0
' based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of @entity87 with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men			0
' @entity225 , co-chair of @entity87 and chairman of @entity87 's @entity227 , is the only woman among the top 17 most - highly paid executives			0
minority of one : co-chairman of @entity87 @entity231 , the only woman earning more than $ 1million a year at the company , and chief executive officer of @entity0 @entity235 leaked : five of @entity0 's movies including the hotly anticipated remake of @entity64 have been illegally shared online in recent days she earns £ 3million a year , according to the spreadsheet , joint highest on the list , along with @entity0 ceo @entity235			1
@entity242 reviewed almost @entity243 of leaked internal data and reported it included ' employee criminal background checks , salary negotiations , and doctors ' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence			0
' it reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by breaking @entity258 creator @entity257 as well as ' email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing , while one disciplinary letter details a manager 's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate			0
' it even details the leaked information includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive			0
