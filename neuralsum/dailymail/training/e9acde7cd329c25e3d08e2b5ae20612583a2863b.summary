by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 04:24 est , 8 june 2012 a former soldier who bravely took on penny - pinching @entity3 bosses in his fight to get a drug that could save his life has died of terminal cancer aged 37			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 in @entity10 , spent six months of his precious time trying to obtain the drug @entity11 - but by the time he got it , it was too late			1
@entity15 , 33 , revealed how her husband was forced to lie to doctors to get hold of the life - prolonging treatment that had been denied to him because of a cruel postcode lottery			1
torn apart : @entity8 , pictured with wife @entity15 and children @entity23 and @entity25 , died on monday after a nine - year battle with cancer the father of two succumbed to the brain tumour he had been battling for nine years at around 6am on monday morning , with his wife at his side			1
grieving mrs @entity32 paid tribute to her husband , who served in @entity34 and @entity35 during nine years in the army , saying : ' the @entity11 did n’t have any effect but we had to fight for six months in order to get it			1
' in all that time his tumour had been growing			2
in the end , he had to claim he was living at another address in order to get the treatment			1
' who knows what would have happened if he had got the drug sooner - i truly believe it would have helped him			1
' he was forced to lie			2
we were told his chemotherapy was n’t working and he had to either let the tumour grow or have the @entity11 - we did n’t have a choice			1
the only way we could get the drug was for @entity8 to register at a doctor in @entity57 and say he was living at a friend ’s address			1
' within 24 hours his application had been approved and within a week he was having his first treatment			1
' how can it be so easy for some people to get it and other people are told they ca n’t have it at all ? brave : mr @entity8 fought in the army fro nine years before he was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003 ' the system is completely unfair			2
we felt bad about lying , but we had gone down the moral route and spent six months fighting for nothing			1
' we had to lie while @entity8 was still alive , but i do n’t care who knows now			2
i would urge anyone else who is going through the same thing to do what we did			2
' i only wish we had done it sooner			2
' in december it was reported how @entity8 ’s long battle with cancer had culminated in a fight for @entity11 after his consultant said it could give him vital time with his daughter @entity23 , seven , and son @entity25 , five			1
but @entity3 bosses refused to fund the medicine , even though it was readily available to patients just 15 miles from where @entity8 lived			1
the 37 - year - old was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003 but after a long and determined battle he was told in august 2011 that his cancer had spread			1
@entity11 , which works by preventing the blood vessels reaching the tumour and costs £ 21,000 for a ten - month course , was his last hope			1
without it , doctors said he had just 12 months left to live			1
but letters to the @entity104 as well as @entity105 were knocked back			2
the drug is not currently ‘ readily approved ’ as a treatment by the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) , which means funding for it sits with the @entity104			1
@entity10 said decisions to fund treatments are based on clear clinical evidence , cost - effectiveness , the benefit to patient and consideration of national guidance			1
a spokesman from @entity105 said in december : ' we were sorry to hear about this patient ’s individual circumstances			2
unfortunately , we are unable to comment further on individual cases			0
' currently , @entity11 is not readily approved by @entity108 guidance and therefore funding for treatment that falls outside of @entity108 sits with @entity104			1
' decisions about whether to fund drugs from the @entity104 are made solely by cancer specialists			0
' helpless : mrs @entity32 said her terminally ill husband was forced to lie to doctors to get the life - prolonging treatment he had been denied because of a postcode lottery a statement from the @entity134 read : ' the panel is clear that it made the correct clinical judgement			1
it was a judgement made on purely clinical grounds and not in any way for financial reasons			0
' of the 10 @entity142 in @entity143 , the vast majority do not fund the use of @entity11 for the treatment of @entity146			1
indeed @entity134 is aware that only two routinely fund this treatment			2
' the @entity148 @entity104 committed £ 10,025,749 to be spent on cancer drugs up to the end of march 2012			2
the @entity134 processed 766 applications and 94 per cent of all requests were supported			0
' @entity3 @entity148 does not fund @entity11 for brain cancer patients , but @entity154 and the @entity155 does			1
this means it is available for patients just 15 miles away in @entity159 , and in @entity57 where @entity8 had all of his cancer treatment , but not in @entity9			1
with an uncertain future ahead of them , the @entity162 renewed their vows last november on their tenth wedding anniversary			0
mrs @entity32 said : ' the nearest surgery where @entity8 would have been allowed the treatment was just five miles away			1
@entity8 could have walked it			0
' grief : by the time mr @entity8 got the drug in february , his cancer was too advanced for it to have any effect mr @entity8 ’s application was approved in february but his cancer , which he had fought since the age of 29 , was already too advanced for the drug to have any affect and was affecting his balance and coordination			2
his wife said : ' i know he ’s been poorly and we all knew it would happen at some point , but it is still such a shock			0
' he fell over on thursday and he fell against the bedroom door so i had to call an ambulance to come and get him out but he only went into hospital because the paramedics were worried about his neck			0
' he was supposed to be coming out but they could n’t discharge him because of the bank holiday			0
' as far as we were concerned , he was coming home			0
he had been tired over the last few weeks but he had still been his normal self			0
' when he was in hospital he had been laughing and joking with the nurses and giving them stick like he always has done , but then he started complaining of head pains and he was put on stronger painkillers			0
' after that he was a lot drowsier and when i took the kids into see him on sunday night he was sleeping peacefully			0
then i got the call to say he had taken a turn for the worse in the early hours of monday morning			0
' as he died , i was holding him and cuddling him and telling him i loved him			0
only a few more days and it would have been exactly nine years since his diagnosis			0
' in the last year , the family have tried to pack as many memories into the time @entity8 had left , taking their children on holidays to @entity208 and on days out			0
before his death , mrs @entity32 prepared memory boxes for @entity23 and @entity25 , leaving them special photographs and medals from his time in the army			0
his wife added : ' i do n’t think his death has sunk in yet			0
i do n’t think i totally believe it			0
i still have to break it to the children and i do n’t know what i will say to them			0
because they are still so young they wo n’t understand it for a while until they realise he ’s not coming home			0
' i wo n’t know what words i will use to tell them until i actually have to say them			0
' @entity8 has written them both letters saying how much he loves them and how he is sorry he wo n’t get to see them grow up			0
he was such a loving husband and father , there was nothing he would n’t have done for his family			2
' people often complain about the smallest things , but @entity8 never once complained , he was so brave			0
' even after he got the @entity11 he continued to campaign against the postcode lottery on behalf of others and i want to continue to do the same			1
it ’s what he would have wanted			0

father of two spent six months battling to get drug @entity11
postcode lottery meant he could not get medicine that was available to patients living just a few miles away
eventually lied about address to get treatment - but it was too late
