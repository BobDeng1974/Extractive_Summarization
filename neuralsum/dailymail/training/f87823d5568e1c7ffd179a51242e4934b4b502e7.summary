former @entity1 press secretary @entity0 joined a chorus of @entity4 naysayers on wednesday , saying there 's no question of whether the @entity7 will put ' boots on the ground ' in @entity10 – only a question of how many			1
' " no boots on the ground " is semantically problematic , ' @entity0 told @entity13 anchor @entity12 , ' because obviously there will be @entity7 military personnel with their boots on the ground			1
' ' there are already , ' @entity12 replied			0
' ' i want to be clear , ' @entity4 insisted			0
' the @entity7 forces that have been deployed to @entity10 do not and will not have a combat mission			1
they will support @entity10 forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists			2
' @entity0 seemed at odds with his old boss 24 hours later on @entity13 , but he also kept a tunnel of daylight between @entity4 and former president @entity53 , whose decade - long @entity10 war was a gigantic military operation involving nearly 150,000 @entity7 servicemen and women			1
' there is the distinction that is being drawn ... between what we did in @entity10 – a war that lasted for a very long time , cost us an enormous amount of money and cost a lot of people their lives and resulted in sustained and terrible injuries for many , many more – and what we are doing now , ' @entity0 said			1
conservative publisher @entity28 suggested that the @entity1 should n't rule out a scenario where military commanders declare , " you know what ? this thing is on the cusp			0
we need to send in 3,000 or 5,000 @entity7 combat ground troops to win this thing "			2
' ' that would be saying specifically only 5,000 , ' @entity0 replied , ' not 5,005			0
' ' no , ' said @entity28 : ' you would be leaving the option open , which is what a serious commander - in - chief does			0
' on tuesday , @entity86 chairman gen. @entity85 told the @entity87 that circumstances on the ground could drive him to push for @entity7 combat troops to be embedded with @entity10 army units			1
' if we reach the point where i believe our advisers should accompany @entity10 troops on attacks against specific @entity27 targets , ' @entity85 said , using an alternative name for the terror group , ' i will recommend that to the president			1
' asked by @entity103 @entity102 sen. @entity102 whether the president had ruled out the use of @entity7 ground forces in a combat role , @entity85 responded , ' yes			1
but he has told me as well to come back to him on a case - by - case basis			1
' he said that if needed , he ' would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces			0
' on wednesday @entity4 cited both the @entity10 conflict and the emergence of a new ebola virus epidemic in west africa as signifying ' @entity7 's unique abilities and responsibilities to lead			1
' on monday night the @entity1 announced a deployment of 3,000 ground troops and @entity120 engineers to intervene in @entity121 , a country that has already seen more than 2,400 diagnosed cases and 1,300 deaths from the disease			0
' it is @entity7 that has the unique capability to mobilize against an organization like @entity27 , ' he said			0
' in a world full of broader social challenges , it is @entity7 that has the unique capability and know - how to help contain and combat a threat like @entity135			2
' aside from his early roll call of the various armed services , @entity4 's biggest applause line was his direct threat to @entity27			2
' whether in @entity10 or in @entity141 , ' the president said , ' these terrorists will learn the same thing that leaders of @entity145 already know : we mean what we say			2
' ' our reach is long			0
if you threaten @entity7 , you will find no safe haven			0
we will find you eventually			0

former @entity1 press secretary seemed to be at odds with president @entity4
but @entity0 drew a stark contrast between @entity4 's @entity10 war and @entity53 's
the president told servicemen and women at @entity161 on wednesday that @entity7 forces in @entity10 ' will not have a combat mission '
@entity86 chairman gen. @entity85 said tuesday that @entity4 has asked him to *re-evaluate* the question'on a case - by - case basis '
