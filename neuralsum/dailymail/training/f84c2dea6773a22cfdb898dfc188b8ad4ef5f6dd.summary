‘ my wife is always moaning at me but there are worse things to be addicted to			0
i do n’t drink alcohol , for instance			0
mind you i do n’t drink any water , either			0
’ in 2011 mr @entity6 almost died of heart disease and because his arteries were so clogged he had to have a life - saving quadruple heart bypass mr @entity6 almost died from heart disease when his addiction was at its height in 2011			1
he started to suffer from shortness of breath and tests revealed he had severely clogged arteries			0

he was so dependent on @entity9 he would suffer withdrawal symptoms if he did n’t down a two - litre bottle during the night - and still tops himself up through the small hours			2
