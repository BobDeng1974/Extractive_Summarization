but payments to 1,934 others have been delayed or because ' trading conditions for some outlets have been tough , ' the report states			0

@entity0 will fork out more than $ 645,000 to repay its employees , after an an audit of wages across 106 of its franchise stores found they were underpaid in 2011 and 2012 @entity0 employs more than 7,000 people across 360 company - owned and franchise outlets in every @entity81 ( except @entity82 )			1
in a company report , @entity83 , the @entity36 owner of @entity0 , stated : ' on behalf of its @entity0 franchisees it would like to state , for the record , that it was never their intention to underpay their employees			2
' a spokesperson for @entity83 , @entity91 , said it was n't until 2011 that it was brought to the company 's attention that the pay rate which had been agreed with the @entity97 was actually below the award wage			0
' it was n't like it was something that had n't been through the appropriate industry processes , ' he told the @entity58			0
mr @entity91 says the company has implemented processes to ensure that any agreements across its operations comply with the award rates but says it is the responsibility of individual franchisees to make those payments back to staff			0
' this is difficult in some cases because a few of those stores are actually no longer operating and because it 's such a casual workforce with high staff turnover , a lot of those staff may actually not be at those franchises anymore			0
' the @entity8 says it encourages any employee or former employee of @entity0 who believes they may have been underpaid to get in touch with the @entity8 .			0
