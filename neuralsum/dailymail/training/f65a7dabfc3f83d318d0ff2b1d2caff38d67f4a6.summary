@entity8 's guilty verdict was overturned earlier this year and it appeared in may that she would be free within weeks as prosecutors had not yet filed an appeal			1
however , on monday , the @entity11 declared its intent to retry her for the 1989 murder of four - year - old @entity15 - and it plans on using testimony from an allegedly crooked ex-police officer who helped put her behind bars			1
retrial : @entity8 , pictured left , was due to be released from prison after spending 22 years on death row for brutally killing her son @entity15 , right , will now face a retrial the news came just hours after an ultimatum from a @entity27 @entity26 judge ordering the state to either release her from prison or announce a retrial , according to @entity32			1
the @entity34 's office will try to put @entity8 , 49 , her back on death row in the trial , which has n't been scheduled			1
her conviction was thrown out earlier this year by the 9th @entity37 because of a tainted confession supposedly obtained by @entity40 police officer @entity39 who has a long history of lying under oath			1
in the original trial it was @entity8 's word against the officer 's and @entity8 was convicted despite there being no recording and no witness to the confession that @entity8 said was never made			1
@entity8 's lawyer said that he will attempt to secure bond for the woman after she is transferred from state prison to the @entity55			1
known as @entity56 , @entity8 was found guilty in 1989 for the gruesome slaying of her young son @entity15 who was shot three times in the back of the head and dumped in the desert			1
ready for release : @entity8 , left , had her murder conviction overturned after spending more than 20 years on death row for the killing of her 4 - year - old son , @entity15 , right , in december 1989 but this year @entity37 judge agreed with her lawyers who ruled the conviction had been due in part because of @entity39 's misconduct			1
@entity8 's conviction was overturned on march 14th allowing prosecutors to launch an appeal to hold a retrial within 30 days			1
no application had been filed until now			0
the case made national headlines due to the brazen and disturbing nature of the crime			0
prosecutors said in december 1989 , @entity8 dressed up her son @entity15 in his favorite outfit and told him he was going to see @entity86 at a @entity40 mall during the holidays			1
instead , he was taken into a ravine in the desert by her boyfriend , @entity92 and another man called @entity94 and shot three times in the back of the head as part of what prosecutors said was a plot by @entity8 and the two other defendants to collect a $ 50,000 life insurance policy			1
@entity8 , who was not present at the crime , was convicted in 1990 of murder , conspiracy to commit murder , child abuse and kidnapping on the strength of testimony by @entity39 , who said she confessed to the crimes			0
spared : @entity8 would have been the first woman executed in @entity11 since the 1930s had her appeals run out the detective testified that @entity8 told him she had contemplated having an abortion while pregnant with @entity15 and had complained to @entity117 about her son			1
@entity117 was hardly an ideal babysitter			0
he had @entity119 stemming in large part from an incident during the war when he shot and killed a young @entity124 boy who had climbed onto a truck transporting @entity117 and other @entity126 in @entity124 , according to court documents			0
in his 1985 personal journal , now part of court records , @entity117 wrote : ' losing sleep because of dreams in @entity124 [ sic ] seeing kids including my own and wondering if i 'm going to do something to hurt them , and remembering the ones i had to kill			0
' with @entity15 in the car , @entity117 picked up his good friend @entity92			0
the two men did not take @entity15 to see @entity86			0
instead , they drove @entity15 into the desert , where @entity117 emptied three bullets into the boy 's @entity144 police department 's star interrogator , detective @entity39 , was called in on his day off to separately question the three			2
@entity8 was convicted in 1990 of murder , conspiracy to commit murder , child abuse and kidnapping in a plot to collect a $ 50,000 life insurance policy in a matter of hours , @entity39 had secured a speedy resolution to the horrific high - profile holiday crime.the detective said she confessed to conspiring to the murder , although she protested her innocence and denied the claim			1
the three suspects were tried separately , convicted , and sentenced to die			0
@entity8 would have been the first woman executed in @entity11 since the 1930s had her appeals run out			1
the @entity164 had gone so far to issue a death warrant for @entity8 in 1997 , but the execution was delayed because she had yet to exhaust federal appeals			0
during her original trial , the prosecution failed to disclose information about a history of misconduct by @entity39			1
that record included multiple court rulings in four other cases that @entity39 either lied under oath or violated suspects ' miranda rights during interrogations			0
prosecutors are required to provide a defendant 's lawyers with material that might support a not - guilty verdict , including material that could undermine the credibility of a prosecution witness			2
there was no other witness or recording of the purported confession by @entity8 , who has proclaimed her innocence			2
in court proceedings and press interviews , @entity8 professed her innocence , claiming @entity39 had a history of lying under oath and had fabricated her confession			1
the trial amounted to ' a swearing contest ' in which the judge and jury ultimately believed the detective over @entity203 , but they did n't know of his record of dishonesty and misconduct			1
the ruling reversed a @entity27 @entity200 's ruling and ordered the lower court to require @entity11 authorities to turn over all relevant personnel records for the detective			2
in 2009 , defense attorney @entity214 said his client maintains her innocence and was a loving mother who still grieves her son 's death			0
' our main concern is the fact that i have a client that never confessed and a police detective who said she gave a confession , ' @entity214 said then			2
' there was no tape recorder , no witnesses , nothing			0
' key witness : @entity8 , left , was found guilty on the strength of testimony by a @entity40 police detective , who said the mother told him she had contemplated having an abortion while pregnant with @entity15 , right in march the @entity238 reversed @entity8 's conviction in what chief judge @entity240 dubbed a ' troubling case			1
' he called into question what he said was @entity39 's possible ' misogynistic ' attitude towards vulnerable civilian women over whom he had power and noted @entity39 had a documented history of lying under oath			2
@entity240 's blistering 60 - page opinion and other court records shed light on the alleged police corruption , prosecutorial overreach and judicial carelessness that fused into a miscarriage of justice that might have sentenced an innocent woman to death			2
@entity8 testified she did n't know @entity15 had died until @entity39 informed her of his death in an interrogation room			0
she said she was ' in shock ' and ' reeling ' but the detective moved close to her and put his hands on her knees			0
she told the jury she had n't understood her @entity269 rights and had asked for a lawyer , but instead @entity39 continued interrogating her and twisted her words into a fake confession			0
' she was one of the worst witnesses i 've ever seen , ' recalled @entity144 journalist @entity275 , who covered the trial			0
although he destroyed his notes of the interview and failed to tape record it , @entity39 testified that @entity8 confessed she worried that @entity15 would grow up to be just like his father , a substance - abusing ex-con			2
that 's why she ' wanted @entity283 to take care of @entity15 , ' @entity39 testified			0
after @entity8 was convicted , her defense investigators spent 7,000 hours poring over court records			0
they discovered eight separate cases in which judges determined that @entity39 either had lied under oath or violated the constitutional rights of people he interrogated			0
but @entity292 , the judge , still decided that @entity39 was more credible than @entity8 court records indicate that neither @entity117 nor @entity92 would testify against @entity8			2
in overturning @entity8 's conviction , the appellate court did n't find her innocent			1
' @entity8 may well be guilty , even if @entity39 made up her confession out of whole cloth , ' @entity240 wrote			2
' after all , it 's hard to understand what reason @entity117 and @entity92 would have had for killing a four - year - old boy			1
then again , what reason would they have to protect her if they knew she was guilty ? ' @entity8 , now 49 , was jailed the day after @entity15 's death			2
she is one of three women on death row in @entity11 and has been behind bars for 25 years and on death row for 22 years			0
the two men convicted in the @entity8 's case , @entity92 and former @entity203 roommate @entity117 , are also both on death row			0
@entity92 confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy 's body .			0

' @entity56 's ' conviction was overturned in march after it was found to be in part due to a detective lying under oath
but the @entity11 announced on monday they plan to hold a retrial
judge decided to believe police officer over mom of four - year - old son
@entity8 may still be the first woman executed in @entity11 since the 1930s
prosecutors in original trial failed to disclose lead detective , who claimed he obtained a confession , had past misconduct issues
