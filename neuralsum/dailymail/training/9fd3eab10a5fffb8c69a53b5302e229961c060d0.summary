by @entity0 overlooked : @entity2 boss @entity1 believes politicians should stop ignoring ' sensible proposals ' to increase secret ballot turnouts @entity7 leaders yesterday called for @entity9 ’s anti-strike laws to be unpicked to allow ballots on industrial action to take place in the workplace and on the internet			1
they claimed the reason turnouts in recent strike ballots were so poor was because they have to be conducted by postal vote , with papers sent to members ’ homes			1
@entity2 boss @entity1 said : ‘ instead of imposing a ballot threshold that not a single mp met in the last election , politicians should stop ignoring sensible proposals to increase secret ballot turnouts at the workplace and online			2
‘ it is hard to see how an offer to depress living standards for the foreseeable future and stop people doing anything about it will win votes at the next election			0
’ @entity37 , acting general secretary of the @entity39 union , warned of wildcat strikes if changes are made to balloting laws			2
‘ if you remove the right to strike legally or make it almost impossible , then workers will , understandably , take matters into their own hands , ’ he said			0
‘ if a majority of workers in a democratic , secret ballot decide to take action as last resort over their safety or jobs but the government or a judge says you ca n’t do that because you ’ve not reached a threshold or because this is an essential service , it is obvious how workers with a proud militant tradition will react			0
‘ they will eventually take their own action and you will see highly disruptive wildcat action called at very short or no notice			0
’ though yesterday ’s strikes were based on ballots held in some cases several years ago , which saw low turnout from members , union leaders insisted their action was ‘ valid and lawful ’			1
business leaders are pressing for a new law setting a target of at least 50 per cent of those balloted having to vote in favour			0
walkout : though yesterday 's strikes were based on ballots held in some cases several years ago , which saw low turnout from members ' union leaders insisted their action was ' valid and lawful '			1

leaders believe postal vote has caused a poor turnout at recent strikes
means papers are sent to homes rather than the workplace or put online
@entity1 said @entity94 should stop ignoring ' sensible proposals '
union leaders insisted yesterday 's strike was ' valid and lawful '
