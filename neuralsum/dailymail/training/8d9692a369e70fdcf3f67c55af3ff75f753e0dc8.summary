by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 06:11 est , 18 january 2013 @entity1 , 55 , has been found guilty of misconduct after streaking naked with pupils on an outward bound school trip a grammar school teacher who streaked in front of his pupils has quit his job after being found guilty of misconduct			1
@entity1 , 58 , had been camping with the group of 12 - and 13 - year - olds on a field trip when he agreed to run naked across a garden			1
the married teacher told a disciplinary panel : ‘ the lads had streaked for a joke and they were saying , “ come on sir , you have a go			2
” ‘ at that point , for whatever reason , i got up , ran down the garden and ran back in			0
even when i did it i thought , “ what am i doing ? ” ’ @entity1 , who received an mbe four years ago for his work with children , was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct this week after admitting it had been ‘ inappropriate ’ to streak			1
he has since quit his job and will hear in the next month whether he will be struck off the teaching register			0
the hearing was also told how he undressed in an area where children were showering during the school camping trip to the @entity36 centre in @entity37 and @entity38 in november 2011			1
@entity1 , from @entity39 in @entity40 , was also accused of inappropriately hugging a female pupil from @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , where he taught			1
however , the @entity47 hearing in @entity48 ruled that undressing in front of boys while they showered and hugging the girl , who @entity1 said was hypothermic , did not amount to misconduct			1
addressing the moment @entity1 streaked in front of the children , panel chairman @entity55 told him : ‘ teachers have a responsibility to uphold public trust in the profession and to maintain high standards of behaviour within and outside school			1
he also presided over a bizarre ' peeing ' competition between students from @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , on the camping trip between november 4 and 6 , 2011 @entity1 , who taught @entity66 for 37 years , admitted he was ' out of date ' and said he was ' aghast ' that traditional teaching methods were now considered ' frightening ' ‘ on this occasion you failed to maintain the appropriate boundaries and appropriate delineation of behaviour that should exist between pupils and teachers			1
‘ we are satisfied that your actions do amount to unprofessional conduct which may bring the profession into disrepute			0
’ the @entity66 master was awarded an mbe in 2008 for services to young people after running schemes for the @entity85 for 30 years			0
he said at the time that organising trips was ‘ normally just an excuse to have fun and enjoy the animal vitality the young exude ’			0
@entity1 , who has taught for 37 years , said he realised while streaking that what he was doing was unprofessional			2
‘ at the time and also shortly afterwards i realised it was inappropriate , ’ he added			0
‘ i thought , “ what the hell are you doing ? i ’ve not done this before – why am i doing it now ? ” ’ however , referring to the accusations about hugging the girl , @entity1 said he was ‘ aghast ’ that what used to be considered normal behaviour for teachers could now cause complaints			2
‘ the thing that comes out of this is how out of date i am , ’ he said			0
‘ what is viewed as normal today seems to have gone to a frightening situation where an adult ca n’t be near to a child without being accused of something			0
’ @entity113 , representing @entity1 , added : ‘ he made a very serious error of judgment after working a 16 - hour day and suffering from fatigue			2

@entity1 , 55 , also undressed in a shower area where children , aged 12 and 13 , were naked
and on another occasion the teacher , from @entity39 , @entity40 , hugged a female pupil

he is yet to learn whether he will be struck off as a teacher
