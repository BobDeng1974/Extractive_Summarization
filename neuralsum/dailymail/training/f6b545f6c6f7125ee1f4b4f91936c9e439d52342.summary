this adorable puppy might look like the most chilled canine on the planet as he blissfully settles into bath time , but just two weeks ago he was close to death			2
the two - week - old was close to death when he was found abandoned in a dumpster with his two sisters - but now it looks like his troubles are a million miles away			1
they were found by @entity13 in @entity14 and referred to the @entity16 animal shelter where volunteer @entity17 was tasked with looking after them			0
spa day : the puppy , who does not yet have a name , relaxed in a warm bath in a sink rest and recovery : the puppy almost died when he was dumped in a dumpster with his two sisters the 21 - year - old student said : ' when they were found they were covered in fleas and would not have survived without their mother			1
' the little guys need round - the - clock care - they ca n't use the restroom by themselves or even regulate their own body temperature			1
' i do everything for them and they need to be fed every couple of hours			0
' she added : ' i decided to film him in the bath because he was enjoying it so much and i really wanted to capture it			0
' he just looked so content			0
drying off : the puppy loves bath - time , unlike his sisters , and made sure to dry off in a towel afterwards lucky to be alive : the three puppies were thrown in a dumpster but were saved by the @entity13 ' his sisters definitely do not enjoy bath time as much as this little guy but it needs to be done			1
' their mother is n't here to keep them clean so i have to do it and then blow dry them - they need constant care and attention			2
' because they are so young the puppies are yet to be named			2
' we are trying to think of some really strong names for the three of them , ' added @entity17			0
' but they 've only just opened their eyes and they do a lot of sleeping			0
nap time : the three puppies have been getting plenty of shut eye to recover from the experience healthy appetites : the tiny canines are being looked after at the @entity16 animal shelter in @entity83 ' as they get older we will start to see more of their personalities and will have a better idea of what to call them			1
' with @entity91 soon approaching @entity17 has some advice for anybody who is thinking of buying a puppy			0
she said : ' people should be looking to adopt puppies instead of buying them at @entity91 time - there are so many puppies in shelters that really need a loving home			1
' but that advice should be taken onboard all year round			0
' playing coy : the little puppy has been keeping a low profile at the rescue center and getting plenty of sleep adopt me : the puppies about being looked after by volunteers but are looking for a new home			1
