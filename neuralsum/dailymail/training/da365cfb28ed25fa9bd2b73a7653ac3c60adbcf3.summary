@entity0 might have made a big deal over @entity3 's insistence on taking @entity5 's penalty in their 1 - 0 win over @entity7 , but the @entity5 captain 's comments from earlier in the season indicate the striker was right to take the ball from @entity13			1
injured midfielder @entity0 , working as a @entity15 pundit for @entity5 's first - leg @entity17 win , accused @entity3 of showing ' disrespect ' and labelled him ' mischievous ' after he took the winning penalty ahead of stand - in skipper @entity13			1
but with @entity3 having missed just two of his 29 career penalties , @entity0 spoke out earlier this season to confirm that the £ 16million summer signing would be @entity26 ' second - choice spot - kick taker			2
@entity3 takes the ball to take the penalty from @entity13 despite the stand - in skipper 's inital protests @entity31 looked furious at @entity3 for questioning @entity13 's authority and taking the spot - kick while @entity7 ' players argued with the referee over the penalty , @entity5 argued among themselves all was well in the end though when @entity3 fired the penalty into @entity40 's bottom corner for a 1 - 0 win @entity3 sought out @entity13 after scoring the goal and later thanked him with this @entity44 post @entity3 ( right ) shares a laugh with @entity46 after his penalty spat at @entity48 on thursday night @entity13 ( right ) was also back in training at @entity50 on friday with @entity51 and @entity31 ' i 'm aware he 's a terrific penalty taker , ' @entity0 said in august after scoring a penalty for @entity5 in their 3 - 0 win at @entity56			1
' i 'm sure he 'll get the chance to take some penalties for the club			0
the manager 's told me if i 'm not on the pitch he 'll take them			0
' and given @entity3 's record - it was a good decision for him to take the ball , as proven when he converted			2
@entity13 , on the other hand , has never scored a penalty in a match of this magnitude and was not even mentioned by @entity0 as one of his spot - kick replacements back in august , putting him behind @entity3 and @entity72 in that regard			1
@entity31 , the other option on the field , has missed one of three penalties in the @entity78 and who would not have inspired the same confidence in @entity81 that @entity3 's presence did as fans sang his name during the argument			1
@entity0 said on @entity15 that @entity3 was disrespectful but had previously said he would be second - choice @entity13 ( right ) gets a lift into @entity5 training on friday in @entity89 's @entity88 @entity3 ( right ) also hitched a lift in as he got back to work at @entity5 's @entity50 training base @entity31 gives the thumbs up through the window of his car as he arrives at @entity50 the incident did n't do wonders for @entity13 's image as a captain , though			1
the @entity48 club 's vice-captain was starting with the armband for just the eighth time but saw his authority brought into question by @entity3			0
@entity13 later went on to say : ' i wanted the penalty , @entity3 felt confident and he has taken big penalties before			2
' everyone wants to take them			0
i felt confident in @entity3 , he has taken big penalties before and he got the nod			0
' @entity0 , sat up in the television box , would n't have put up with such behaviour and it seems unlikely that even the @entity116 forward would have taken the same action			2
instead , with three months and 10 days left until @entity0 's potential final game for @entity5 - the fa cup final - questions surround the respect for the man who takes over his role when the 34 - year - old moves on to @entity124			1
@entity3 waves a hand at @entity127 as he prepares to put the ball down for the ultimately successful spot - kick it 's not the first time @entity31 has shown anger on the field , but this time it did not seem to be in self interest @entity31 was still complaining about @entity3 's actions even after the @entity116 put @entity5 ahead the £ 16million forward casts an eye over to his strike - partner during the @entity17 first - leg win @entity5 's players , and in particular @entity3 , looked to be having a laugh at @entity50 on friday @entity3 and @entity13 were both in as the @entity142 recovered from their @entity17 extertions @entity144 ( left ) , @entity145 ( third left ) , @entity147 ( third right ) , @entity13 ( second right ) and @entity89 ( right ) go for a jog at @entity5 's @entity50 training base @entity152 columnist and @entity5 legend @entity151 said on @entity154 : ' @entity3 would never have been on the penalties because he was on the bench , the same would have applied to @entity157 if he was on the bench			1
' @entity31 was supposed to take it and looked a little peeved along with @entity13 but at that moment the best penalty taker @entity161 had on the pitch was @entity3 as we 've seen with his spot kicks for @entity165			2
' so in this instance i was ok with it because the main penalty taker was n't on the pitch in @entity0			0
and also because he scored ! ' ( @entity151 later clarified that @entity13 was the original chosen taker , not @entity31 ) and while @entity13 eventually allowed @entity3 to take the decisive penalty , which the goalscorer thanked him for later , @entity31 seemed less than happy - even after the ball found the bottom - left corner with goalkeeper @entity40 sent the wrong way			1
the @entity178 forward was seen ranting to @entity179 away from the celebrations in scenes that brought back images of his petulant reaction to being substituted by @entity26 against @entity184 last january - for which he later offered an apology			0
should @entity5 pick up another spot - kick in the return leg in @entity190 or against @entity191 on sunday , another decision may have to be made			2
@entity0 does n't expect to be back in action until two weeks time and thinks the second leg will come too soon			0
' i think i 'm a couple of weeks away from returning to playing but it 's settled down well , ' he told @entity15			0
' i do n't really want to put a target game on the injury			0
i think next week will come too soon			0
' @entity31 did not even seem pleased to be taking the lead - a contrast to his partnership with @entity202 @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity0 talk through the decision - making process over the penalty @entity13 will take over the captaincy from @entity0 when he leaves for @entity124 in the summer			1

@entity0 accused @entity3 of ' disrespect ' for taking penalty from @entity13
stand - in skipper saw his authority questioned by @entity3 's behaviour
but @entity0 previously made it clear @entity116 was second pick for penalties
@entity178 striker @entity31 was less than impressed with his strike - partner
@entity221 : @entity3 does n't have a long - term future at @entity5 , his team - mates do n't like him and he lacks respect
