when @entity1 's announced that it would be launching a chocolate - covered potato chip , the reception was divided			1
but now that the limited - edition snack has gone on sale , @entity4 has had a chance to put it to the test			1
proving the doubters wrong , the reaction to the salted @entity11 chips dipped on one side in milk chocolate has been overwhelmingly positive			1
the five bags distributed across the team disappeared in a heartbeat - despite containing 800 calories each			2
sweet and salty : @entity1 's milk chocolate - covered potato chips have proved a unanimous hit on team @entity4 reporter @entity23 reflected on this fact afterwards , calling them ' very , very addictive			1
' they were the perfect balance of sweet and salty , ' she continued			0
' although the chocolate was pretty rich			1
i could nâ€™t stop eating them ! ' editorial manager @entity31 said they were ' like choc covered pretzels , but better , ' and photo director @entity35 ' loved the smooth chocolate with a crunch and the subtle salty taste at the end			1
' @entity4 deputy editor @entity40 hailed them ' the best thing since the @entity49 ' - high praise indeed - while social media editor @entity43 said that ' they are everything i 'd ever want in a potato chip and candy bar			1
i ca n't wait to pre-order them by the box			0
' ' they are everything i 'd ever want in a potato chip and candy bar			0
i ca n't wait to order by the box ' the chips were not without some critique though			2
a couple of tasters remarked that they would have preferred more chip and less chocolate - while another mused whether a dark chocolate version would be tastier			2
what 's more , even this snack - loving team felt defeated after eating too many			0
one editor admitted that they are ' totally delicious ' but ' the bag is too big			2
' @entity23 echoed the opinion , but added : ' it was worth it though			0
' success ! the positive verdicts indicate that @entity1 's has struck gold with this unlikely combination the chocolate chips are a limited - edition , only be available during the holidays and exclusively at @entity81 stores			1
if they prove popular , however , they could be made a permanent addition to the @entity86 's product line			0
' they are totally delicious but the bag is too big			2
