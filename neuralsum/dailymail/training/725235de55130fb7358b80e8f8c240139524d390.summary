by @entity0 a teenager was late for her own 18th birthday party after a trainee hairdresser spent six hours giving her a ' terrible ' and ' lopsided ' style			1
@entity5 from @entity6 , @entity7 , paid £ 85 for a shampoo and a blonde dip dye to look her best for the 1960s themed party			1
unbeknown to her , the job was given to a trainee stylist			1
having arrived at @entity15 in @entity16 just after 3pm , she finally left six hours later - with what she describes as ' lopsided ' dyed hair			1
the waitress eventually arrived at her party at 9.30pm - over two - and - a - half hours late			1
by the time she arrived , her relatives from @entity22 were leaving to go home			0
@entity5 , pictured on her 18th birthday , right , arrived late to her own party because a trainee hairstylist took six hours to give her a ' lopsided ' dip dye , left the teen says because of the disastrous trip to the hairdressers she ' did n't enjoy her party at all ' - which took place on march 15 , cost £ 600 and had taken months to organise			1
miss @entity5 says the style has gained her a lot of unwanted attention - with people mocking her hair in the street			1
she says she has tried to get a full refund from the salon - who , she claims , have only offered her £ 40			1
now , she is pursuing legal action after the salon ' refused to take any blame ' for the style			2
she said : ' i could n't believe what they had done - people were laughing at me in the street			2
' i was left looking like an @entity52 hound dog , it was so humiliating			2
your 18th birthday is supposed to be special but it turned into a nightmare for me			2
' i thought the hair cut was going to be done by 6pm but i was concerned when the hairdresser asked how to mix the colours			2
' it looked like she was just mixing some paint but i was too shy and scared to say anything - i had no idea she was n't qualified to do it			1
' i am known for my long hair and now it is ruined			0
the colour has gone all orange and the dip dye is much higher than i wanted and not even straight			2
the waitress posted this picture of the style on @entity74 shortly after her birthday on march 15			2
she says she has been mocked in the street for the dip dye which ' makes her look like an @entity52 hound ' the teen is now taking the salon to court , saying they only offered her a £ 40 refund and ' refused to take any of the blame ' for the style ' i will have to have about five inches cut off and that will be the shortest i have ever had it			1
' i have taken a lot of photos because we are taking the salon to court because they have only agreed to give £ 40 back			2
' the salon manager is refusing to take any blame so it is going all the way to court now			2
' at the time , the teen took to @entity74 to complain about her hairstyle , posting : ' wow ! thank you decisions hairdressing for producing this three gradient hair colour ! ' putting a level 1 trainee on my hair and i really enjoyed sitting there for 6 hours to miss my own 18th birthday party that cost £ 600 ! ' well done ladies ! you really know about customer service ! especially missing the cut , and not even shampooing my hair ! amazing result			1
lets put a level 1 on wedding hair ! that sounds like an amazing idea does n’t it ! ' in another angry post she added : ' majorly gutted the hairdressers pretty much ruined my evening of being 2 hours late to my 18th , nevertheless was an amazing night thank you to everyone who came and got me drinks , cards and presents and to my dad who paid for it all , especially my beatles cake ! ' many of miss @entity5 ' friends took to @entity74 in support			1
@entity127 - who paid for the teen 's hairdo said : ' the hairdresser said it was nice before we left , she even took herself a tip and took £ 90 of my pre-paid money instead of £ 85 ... do u think i have bn robbed ? ' the salon in @entity16 , @entity6			1
salon manager @entity137 says the stylist behind the look has apologised and the family have been offered a partial refund ' i paid £ 18 for mine aswell , 6 hours later it had all fallen down so i did it myself but i do n’t mind , they had created such a homely atmosphere , they had even placed a couple of their hyperactive children in the salon to run around moaning n messing with everything including the foils in paige ’s hair ... i felt right at home			1
' she was just learning her level two , but was totally unsupervised , she asked for help several times but was refused it as she “ had to do it some time			0
" ' the stylist behind the ' terrible ' cut , @entity164 , has said she is ' upset ' the teen did n't like her hair and that she was n't qualified to do the style @entity168 said : ' they should n’t have put a level 1 on your hair not even meant to do anything on level one other than the basic hairdressing stuff			1
' cutting and colouring is level 2 this is absolutely disgusting that a professional hairdressers would even do this to someones hair			0
if this was me id be demanding every little bit off my money back			0
@entity186 said : ' go back and demand your money back that is appalling paige ! ' @entity190 said : ' @entity191 did a better job doing this myself ! make sure they pay paige ! disgusting			0
luckily on the picture i saw of you you still looked lovely			0
' @entity198 said : ' oh dear			0
would n’t have had that prob if u came to my salon xxx			0
' the stylist behind the ' terrible ' cut was @entity164 , 29 , who responded to the criticism by saying : ' i ’m studying for my level two qualification and this was level three work			0
it ’s almost like running before you can walk			0
' i was upset because i did my best and i know it was n’t good enough but someone else should have taken over			0
' when i looked at the hair i thought the colour was fine			0
it was the dip dye that looked bad because it had been rushed			1
i feel let down and everyone at college knows it was me who did the girl ’s hair			0
' salon manager @entity137 , 27 , said : ' i was not in the salon at the time			0
the junior stylist was very upset after the family complained as she knew she had made a mistake and she apologised			0
