researchers have taken a step closer to creating ‘ cyborg insects ’ that could carry out spying missions - with biofuel cells that run off their own bodies			1
a team has created the implantable power packs that use the insects ’ own body chemistry to fuel robot attachments fixed on to them			1
the breakthrough brings us one step closer to the the day when bugs can be fitted with recording devices , sensors or other electronics and used as tiny spies - an area which the @entity25 military 's ' mad scientist ' division , @entity22 , has already researched extensively			1
until now researchers had relied on solar power or conventional batteries but they were not powerful enough or did not last long enough to do the tasks required			1
the ¿ cyber bugs ¿ could potentially keep going for days on end - or even for as long as they are alive the @entity25 military 's @entity22 research wing is already researching how to ' control ' insects using hi - tech attachments			1
' bees have been used to locate mines and weapons of mass destruction			0
the @entity41 program is aimed at developing technology to provide control over insect locomotion , just as reins are needed for effective control over horse locomotion , ' says @entity48			0
the new technique , where the insect could ' power ' electronic attachments using its own body chemistry , could be crucial			1
until now researchers had relied on solar power or conventional batteries but they were not powerful enough or did not last long enough to do that tasks required			1
the ‘ cyber bugs ’ could potentially keep going for days on end - or even for as long as they are alive			2
the research from @entity60 in the @entity25 involved putting two enzymes into cockroaches to break down the complex molecules they make after eating			2
the first turns the molecules into sugar , and the second oxidises it - in the process releasing electrons			0
these electrons are then run into the battery and produce a current			0
one of the advantages of the technique is that the insect does not have to be in motion for the current to flow , meaning a bug can be put in an enclosed space and the battery will still work			2
after the tests the @entity60 team put electrodes into the insects and found there was no long - term damage , which means they could be re-used for a number of missions			2
@entity88 , chemistry professor at @entity60 and senior author of the paper , said that the possible uses were endless			0
he said : ‘ an insect equipped with a sensor could measure the amount of noxious gas in a room , broadcast the finding , shut down and recharge for an hour , then take a new measurement and broadcast again			0
’ the research team are now trying to make the battery as small as possible so the insect can fly or move around without the power pack restricting it			1
they have calculated that the maximum output from the battery is currently 100 microwatts per square centimeter , at 0.2 volts			0
a typical aa battery , the kind used to power many electronic devices , provides 1.5 volts			0
in a separate study , a team from the @entity109 are developing techniques to harness the movement and body heat of cockroaches which could provide an alternative way of powering gadgets attached to them .			0

@entity119 power battery with their body chemistry
batteries can last for days - or until insect dies
insects could carry sensors into toxic *environment*
