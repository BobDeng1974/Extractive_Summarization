' teacher 's pet : cloud resembling a hand offering an apple bat signal : @entity9 went batty for this cloud ' it ’s great , you can take it as seriously as you like and i ’ve learned quite a lot about the scientific side , which i was n’t initially looking to do			1
but really it ’s just good fun			0
' @entity8 , who captures most of her images while walking her dog , said : ' i have the camera with me all the time			0

riding high : jockey on horse , left , with @entity37 right ' not only does it look very convincing , it is also in keeping with the lighthearted spirit of finding shapes in the clouds			2
' @entity16 founded the society in 2004 because he felt someone needed to ‘ stand up for clouds '			1
he said : ' they get a bad press in this country and yet they are one of nature ’s most varied and beautiful displays			1
' we may not have had the weather for it over the past few weeks , but lying on your back and finding shapes in the clouds is a wonderful aimless and carefree pastime			2
' we need more of theses given this hectic and relentless pace of modern life			0
