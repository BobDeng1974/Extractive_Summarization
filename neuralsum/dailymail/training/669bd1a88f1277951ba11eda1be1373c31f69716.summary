when @entity1 clambered off the bench at the break , he clearly had a point to prove			1
not starting for the first time in the league this season , the young striker was the driving force behind @entity10 coming away from the @entity11 with a point			1
@entity14 ’s side struggled with the intensity of the hosts - drilled by the charismatic @entity17 - until the 22 - year - old ’s half - time inclusion			1
@entity1 was pushed up alongside lone target man @entity20 - his pace frightening @entity22 and tenacity yielding the corner from which @entity25 equalised after @entity27 ’s 25th minute opener			1
@entity25 leaps highest to head in his goal which earned @entity10 a point against @entity22 at @entity11 @entity30 jumps in celebration after giving @entity22 a deserved lead after 25 minutes the @entity33 were rattled by @entity1 ’s ability to run in behind and wanderers went back to the @entity36 with more than had earlier looked likely			1
talking of the change , @entity14 said : ‘ it really helped us			2
@entity1 gave us a little bit of pace in behind their back four			1
we tried to get him in the game and it raised the fans			2
‘ i am disappointed for the players , they played very well			2
there was a great tempo to us			2
there is promise going forward and their goalkeeper has made three fantastic saves			2
’ @entity17 , on the other hand , has already galvanised @entity22 and they sat top of the @entity55 for a portion of the night			1
they press high and attempt to force mistakes in front of vociferous support			2
@entity30 is mobbed by his teammates after putting his side in front in a first half they controlled @entity22 manager @entity17 has given his side a new sense of urgency and is getting positive results @entity22 : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity27 , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 75 ) , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 ( @entity79 61 ) , @entity80			1
subs : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86			0
wolves : @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity25 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 ( @entity95 87 ) , @entity96 ( @entity1 ) , @entity97 , @entity20 ( @entity98 81 )			1
subs : , @entity100 , @entity101 , van @entity102 , @entity104			0
referee : @entity106 ( @entity107 ) it does mean the football is helter - skelter at times , but they are being entertained on a weekly basis			0
results have been consistently positive and there is a manager who is changing the club ’s ethos			0
august ’s mantra of mere survival will not do			0
‘ every time we broke i felt we could score , ’ @entity17 said			2
‘ they brought on @entity1 and he caused us a lot of problems			1
’ it had looked very promising indeed earlier			0
@entity126 - a revelation since joining from @entity128 - won himself a corner he had no right to , with @entity77 ’ resulting centre helped beyond @entity88 at his near post by @entity134			0
the trademark somersaults ensued , and they should have been celebrating again seconds later			0
almost straight from the kick - off , @entity137 - who trapped a nerve in his arm late on and has been assessed by club doctors - picked @entity93 ’ pocket in midfield before sliding in @entity144 , but the @entity145 skewed his shot wide			0
it was a very presentable opportunity and one in which he ought to have finished , much like earlier in the half when the striker could only send a free header wide from eight yards			2
@entity10 manager @entity14 turned the game on its head when he brought on @entity1 at half time @entity22 had plenty of men in their own box when @entity25 headed his goal but could n't prevent him scoring @entity25 celebrates his goal which drew @entity10 level at @entity11 midway through the second half they were almost made to pay for those misses by @entity96 , but the @entity10 midfielder could only find @entity69 ’s right - hand post from the edge of the box			1
it served as a warning sign for the @entity33 , who saw @entity93 twice flash long - range efforts just wide			0
wolves passed the ball competently but lacked real endeavour in the final third			0
@entity175 , @entity93 and @entity92 are imposing in midfield but were n’t able to manufacture the ball wide to @entity94 or @entity97 nearly enough			0
they improved significantly after the inclusion of @entity1			1
@entity20 twice swept efforts wide before @entity97 ’s fierce strike was brilliantly tipped over by @entity69			0
@entity14 ’s switch at the break had worked , if only @entity20 could find the net			0
he again could n’t hit the target , this time missing his kick after @entity1 ’s intelligent pullback			1
but the equaliser was n’t far away and it was all down to @entity1 ’s tireless work			1
he chased down a lost cause , winning a corner , and central defender @entity25 bundled home			1
the healthy travelling contingent in the @entity194 went wild , and it was just reward for their team ’s efforts after the break			0
the manager looked fired up on the touchline , so too his players			0
@entity94 rattled a post and they were n’t able to force a winner - even when @entity1 was put clear in the stoppage time			1
on this basis , neither side will fall away from their lofty @entity55 positions anytime soon .			0

@entity30 puts @entity22 ahead with a flick in first half
@entity1 introduced at half time and changes the game
@entity25 scores the equaliser for @entity10 after *65* minutes
