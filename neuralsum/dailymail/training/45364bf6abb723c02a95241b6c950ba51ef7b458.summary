by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:37 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 04:55 est , 18 july 2013 @entity4 boss @entity3 has laid out a £ 63billion shopping list of left - wing policies he says @entity7 must adopt or lose millions in funding			1
the unite general secretary – dubbed @entity10 – warned @entity7 faces bankruptcy as a result of @entity14 ’s attempts to water down union influence on the party			1
and he said the @entity7 leader had to be ‘ bold ’ and reverse the coalition ’s benefit reforms , halt spending cuts and borrowing billions to build 1million extra homes			1
demands : unite general secretary @entity3 set out his policy wish list , including opposing spending cuts and benefit reforms , which he says @entity7 must adopt pressure has mounted on mr @entity14 over his links to the unions , after allegations emerged that @entity31 had paid for people to join @entity7 without their knowledge to influence candidate selection			1
@entity35 has repeatedly accused @entity7 allowing unions to ' buy ' the party ; s policies , candidates and even mr @entity14 's leadership victory over his brother @entity40			1
@entity31 has given @entity7 more than £ 8.4million in funding since mr @entity14 became leader in 2010			1
earlier this month he announced plans to change the way that union members give money to the @entity7			2
mr @entity14 said union political levy payers would have to ‘ opt in ’ to join @entity7 individually , instead of being signed up automatically			1
but several union leaders have warned there is little enthusiasm among their members for joining @entity7 and the plan could cost the party millions			2
mr @entity3 said it was ‘ a really good , morally defensible idea ’ but in practice it could prove disastrous for @entity7 , with barely 10 per cent of @entity31 ’s 3million political levy payers signing up ;			1
‘ the gamble and the danger is whether it will bankrupt the @entity7 , ’ he said in an interview with the @entity58			0
there was clearly a danger that mr @entity14 's plan ‘ could fall flat on its face and fail ’			0
he added : ‘ there is no doubt we would have to work very hard because our members are not queuing to join the @entity7 , or be associated with the @entity7			0
that is really @entity14 's challenge			0
’ attacks : prime minister @entity35 ( left ) has repeatedly accused unions of ' buying ' @entity7 policies and @entity14 's leadership victory over his brother in 2010 with the threat of millions of pounds of automatic payments disappearing from @entity7 coffers , mr @entity3 set out his demands for a new policy agenda opposing spending cuts and welfare reforms			1
he said mr @entity14 ‘ has got to give ordinary trade unionists reasons to want to be associated with the @entity7 ’			1
‘ and that really is about policy			0
he knows within this next 12 months he has got to start out with policy that gives hope to people and something different from the austerity programme that the government is pursuing that engenders nothing but fear			0
’ he called for the repeal of cuts to housing benefit for unused spare rooms – dubbed the bedroom tax by @entity7 , the reversal of the benefits cap which means no family can receive more than £ 26,000 and an end to ‘ austerity spending ’			1
the end of the spare room subsidy is saving £ 465million - a - year while the benefit cap is expected to save £ 185million			0
it means those two policies alone would require an extra £ 3.25billion in extra borrowing over the course of the next parliament			0
mr @entity3 also called for 1million extra homes to be built , which @entity114 claim could cost £ 60billion			0
a @entity118 source said : ' this proves that nothing ’s changed			0
@entity3 's unite union still has total control over a weak @entity14			2
@entity3 can still buy @entity7 ’s candidates , buy their policies , and pick their leader			2
‘ in a single article today the @entity31 boss is demanding that @entity7 borrow £ 63.2 billion over the five years , meaning higher taxes and higher bills			1
it ’s hardworking people who would pay the price			0
' mr @entity3 added : ‘ @entity14 has got a real task on his hands			0
the prize of being prime minister is within his grasp ... but he has to be bold - and not just on issues that ordinary working people do n't give a toss about like the union block vote			0
’ at prime minister 's questions yesterday , mr @entity35 stepped up his attacks on @entity7 's union links			2
mr @entity14 accused the @entity143 of caving in to big tobacco after ditching plans for plain cigarette packaging			2
it emerged new @entity118 election guru @entity150 counts tobacco giant @entity151 among the clients of his lobbying firm			0
but mr @entity35 hit back at the @entity7 leader : ' if he wants a lobbying scandal , why does he not try the fact that the trade unions buy his policies , buy his candidates and even bought and paid for his leadership ? ' that is a scandal , and he should do something about it			1
