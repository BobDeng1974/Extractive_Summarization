the @entity1 chairman of @entity2 is facing a huge divorce payout after his estranged wife won the right to have the case heard in @entity8 courts			0
@entity9 , 67 , a former beauty queen , is expected to demand that @entity10 hand over half of his riches after their 43 - year marriage fell apart last year			1
if that happens , it could become one of @entity19 's largest ever divorce payments			2
@entity20 is thought to have paid the most , after reportedly handing £ 220million to @entity21 in 2011			2
during her case , ms @entity9 claimed her husband made her feel like a prisoner on their 1,000 - acre country estate , @entity28 , only allowed her £ 100 per week for food			1
in an attempt to prove @entity19 is her permanent home , miss @entity9 told the court she has 1,000 pairs of shoes in her sprawling £ 30million @entity36 mansion			1
@entity9 , 67 , is expected to demand half of her husband 's estimated £ 440million fortune after she today won the right to have her divorce proceedings thrashed out in @entity19 courts she also told the judge that her husband is worth around £ 440million , though dr @entity10 's lawyers dispute this , saying they do not know the value of his assets			1
in his ruling today , mr @entity48 said he struggled to believe ms @entity9 's statement about her footwear collection , but noted that she spent 54 per cent of her time in this country last year			1
though he found in ms @entity9 's favour , he urged the couple to come to an out - of - court settlement , saying the pair had so much money they would be ‘ hard pressed to spend it all in their lifetimes ’			1
dr @entity10 had been pushing to have the divorce heard in @entity1 , where his wife would be entitled to far less of his wealth			1
he accused ms @entity9 of ‘ passport juggling ’ and being a ‘ forum shopper ’ - planning to leave @entity8 as soon as the divorce is concluded			1
dr @entity10 has already spent nearly three quarters of a million fighting the case , and said he may still proceed with a case in @entity1 - a move described by mr @entity48 as ‘ a nightmare ’			1
the judge said he could not be sure of the extent of dr @entity10 ’s wealth , since he had ‘ declined at this stage ’ to reveal his assets			1
he went on to comment that although @entity1 could be an appropriate country for the divorce , ‘ @entity8 may also be appropriate ’			0
‘ there are many features linking the case to this jurisdiction , just as there are many linking it to @entity1 ’ , the judge said			2
he said @entity28 was ‘ a home ’ for the family but only ‘ one of their homes ’			0
he agreed that the property is not a commercial venture , ‘ as the husband has sought to make out ’			2
in his lengthy judgment , mr @entity48 went on to calculate that miss @entity9 had spent twice as much time in @entity8 compared with @entity1 in recent years			2
this , he concluded , was a ‘ fair amount ’ and was enough to establish ms @entity9 ’s residence			1
‘ i am satisfied as i can be in an uncertain world that the wife does intend to remain here with a regular immigration status , as soon as she has the necessary funding , which i am told is £ 1million , to achieve this			2
of ms @entity9 ’s shoes , he said , ‘ i have asked myself whether the wife was lying when she spoke of 1,000 pairs of shoes			1
it is an awful lot of shoes and would take up an awful lot of space ’			0
the judge did not accuse her of making up the figure , but said there must be ‘ an element of hyperbole ’ in it			2
@entity10 ( left ) and former miss @entity1 @entity9 were married for 43 years until the union fell apart last year			1
if miss @entity9 succeeds in her court claim , it will be one of @entity19 's biggest divorce payouts but he added dr @entity10 had been ‘ evasive ’ and ‘ less than helpful ’ when appeared on video - link from the @entity1 capital of @entity123			1
‘ i have carefully reflected on the wife ’s own evidence and her demeanour and i reminded myself that her words to me and her words to other are inevitably self - serving			0
’ but he concluded , ‘ in the end , i have concluded on the balance of probabilities that the wife has made out her case			0
’ dr @entity10 has previously said press reports of his wealth were ‘ totally false ’ and put about by his estranged wife			1
he asked : ‘ one thousand pairs of shoes ? how are you going to wear 1,000 pairs of shoes ? i do n’t know what she buys , because she loves shopping			0
‘ she shops all over the place			0
the last time i read of 1,000 pairs of shoes ... do you remember @entity149 ? ’ mr @entity48 ruled that @entity8 is the appropriate jurisdiction for in the upcoming divorce			0
he also rejected dr @entity10 ’s application for a stay in the @entity8 proceedings			1
costs will be finalised at a later date			0
dr @entity10 ’s barrister has asked for permission to appeal			1
after the ruling , @entity9 stated : ' i wish to thank the judge , mr @entity48 , for his astute and meticulously detailed findings			1
' i also wish to thank my excellent legal team , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 of counsel			0
i hold the @entity8 justice system in the highest regard and greatest esteem			0
' i have always had a great love of all things @entity8			0
i am proud to be associated with the exquisite @entity19 brand @entity2			0
' i am proud to be one of the beneficiaries of one of the greatest gifts that the @entity8 have given to the world ; the @entity180			0
' this case confirms that @entity8 justice is not only alive but thriving			0
the people of @entity8 are unknowingly very fortunate indeed to have a legal system which is so utterly sound			0
' i am pleased the judge recognised my connection with this great country			0
i am so pleased that that i , my children and my shoes have found a home here			0
' dr @entity10 , chairman of @entity192 , has properties in @entity8 , @entity123 and @entity194			1
he has a 40 per cent stake in @entity2 , and is director of @entity197 which owns ten hotels including the grand @entity199			0
the couple , who married in 1970 and have five grown - up children , and bought their estate in @entity36 in 1998 which is said to include a menagerie of animals and two custom - built lakes costing £ 60,000 each			2
@entity206 , solicitor for @entity9 , said : ' mr @entity48 has made a very just decision			2
' @entity9 trusted in the laws of @entity8 , where she made a real and long - term home for herself and her children , and they did not fail her			2

@entity10 and @entity9 splitting after 43 - year marriage fell apart
ms @entity9 could be in line for half of husband 's fortune after court ruling today
dr @entity10 is believed to be worth £ 440million but he disputes this figure
judge urged couple to settle outside court saying they had more money than they could spend ' in a lifetime '
