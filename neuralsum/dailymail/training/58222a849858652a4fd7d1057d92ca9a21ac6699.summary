spaceflight may be associated with a process of accelerated aging of the immune system , researchers have claimed			1
long - term space flight is known to have detrimental effects on the human body , including muscle and bone loss			2
but now it seems human missions to @entity12 will also need to develop ways to counteract the negative effects on the immune system in order to keep the crew fit and healthy			1
@entity18 scientists have been testing the effects of microgravity on @entity21			1
they found that long - duration missions , such as to @entity12 ( illustration shown ) , could affect the immune system			1
superficially , prolonged microgravity caused mice to experience changes also observed in elderly mice the research , published in the journal @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , was conducted by several @entity18 institutions including @entity32 in @entity33			1
the team used a ground - based model called hindlimb unloading ( @entity37 ) , which simulates some of the effects of spaceflight on mice			0
it involves suspending the back legs of the mice in the air , while their front legs stay on the ground			0
a shower that recycles water just like that on a spacecraft has been unveiled			0
inventor @entity51 , ceo and co-founder of the company behind the product - orbital systems - also worked on @entity57 ’s @entity12 mission project			0
known as the @entity59 ( concept above ) , it collects water instead of letting it run down the drain , and purifies it until it 's drinkable , reducing consumption by 90 per cent			0
on the @entity67 , almost all waste water is recycled to provide the astronauts with a nearly self - sustainable environment			0
the shower starts at a rather daunting £ 2,405 ( $ 3,629 ) , but the company claims it will save an average of £ 212 ( $ 320 ) per year in waste water			0
in the study groups of three mice were suspended for three , six , 13 and 21 days - and killed after each test - to test the effects of microgravity			2
the scientists analysed bone parameters and the frequency of cells that will give birth to b lymphocytes in the bone marrow of young mice , old mice and mice subjected to three weeks of @entity37			0
b lymphocytes - also called b cells - are known to be one of major parts of the human immune system			2
they found that mice in low gravity conditions experience changes in b lymphocyte production in their bone marrow similar to those observed in elderly mice living in @entity21 conditions			1
the same effects could be present in humans			0
while the effects of spaceflight on the human immune system have been known before , this study is the first to suggest that such a ground - based method - namely @entity37 - could be helpful in understanding it further			1
the researchers also say that their model could be used to test or develop molecules and compounds that could improve immune responses in astronauts			0
‘ this study shows that a model of spaceflight conditions could not only be used to test the efficacy of molecules to improve immune responses following spaceflight in astronauts , but also in the elderly and bed - ridden populations on @entity21 , ’ said dr @entity115 , a researcher involved in the work from the @entity117 at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity18			1
dr @entity127 , editor - in - chief of the @entity128 , added : ‘ getting to @entity12 and beyond promises to be a huge task , requiring contributions from almost every scientific discipline			0
‘ for biologists and medical researchers , knowing how altered gravity affect our immune system from challenges aloft can be already be studied on @entity21			1
‘ fortunately for biologists , it 's not rocket science			0
’ currently , astronauts must keep their bodies in shape on the @entity67 by performing regular exercise			0

pictured is @entity162 performing a free - flying spacewalk in 1984 in march of this year , @entity57 astronaut @entity164 and @entity166 cosmonaut @entity165 will undertake the first year - long stay aboard the @entity67			1
the mission is designed to see how astronauts cope with such a prolonged stay in space - previously , crews only spent a maximum of six months aboard the station before returning to @entity21			2
during the mission , experiments will study the effects of long - duration spaceflight on the immune system , in addition to other aspects of human biology such as body chemistry and the heart			1
they will not break the record for the longest continuous time spent in space - that was 437 days , set by @entity189 @entity188 aboard the @entity174 from 1994 to 1995 - but nonetheless , the mission will provide invaluable data for the planned mission to @entity12 , which could take place in the 2030s			2
in tandem with this one - year stay , though , experiments on @entity21 will also prove useful in preparing a crew for the journey to @entity12 - which could take a total of nearly three years , including nine months travelling there and nine months back			2
performing @entity37 studies on mice could be one of the latest ways to gather data for the mission			0
in march of this year , @entity57 astronaut @entity164 ( left ) and @entity166 cosmonaut @entity165 ( right ) will undertake the first year - long stay aboard the iss. the mission is designed to see how astronauts cope with such a prolonged stay in space previously , crews only spent a maximum of six months on the @entity67			1

@entity18 scientists have been testing the effects of microgravity on @entity21
they found that long - duration missions could affect the immune system
specifically , prolonged microgravity caused mice to experience changes also observed in elderly mice
while the effects were known before , the study says its methods could be used to develop a solution for human missions to @entity12
in march this year the @entity231 and @entity189 will begin year - long stays on the @entity67
these will also test the effects on humans of long - duration spaceflights
