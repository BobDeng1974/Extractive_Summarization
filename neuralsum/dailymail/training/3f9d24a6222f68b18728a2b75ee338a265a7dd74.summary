@entity1 scientists are planning to capture a 500 ton asteroid , relocate it and turn it into a space station for astronauts on their way to @entity6			1
the @entity8 's @entity7 will consider the Â£ 1.6bn plan in the coming weeks as it prepares to set its space exploration agenda for the next decade			1
if approved it would be the first time a celestial object has ever been moved by humans			1
captured : @entity1 is considering a plan to ' lasso ' an asteroid and deflect it towards the @entity18 before turning it into a space station a feasibility report prepared by @entity1 and @entity22 ( @entity22 ) scientists outlined how they would go about capturing the asteroid			1
a , ' asteroid capture capsule ' would be attached to an old @entity27 rocket and directed the asteroid between the earth and the moon			1
once close , the asteroid capsule would release a 50ft diameter bag that wrap around the spinning rock using drawstrings			1
the craft would then turn on its thrusters , using an estimated 300kg of propellant , to stop the asteroid in its tracks and tow it into a gravitationally neutral spot			1
from here space explorers would have a stationary base from which to launch trips deeper into space			2
the report said : ' the idea of exploiting the natural resources of asteroids dates back over a hundred years , but only now has the technology become available to make this idea a reality			0
' the feasibility is enabled by three key developments : the ability to discover and characterize an adequate number of sufficiently small near - @entity58 asteroids for capture and return ; the ability to implement sufficiently powerful solar electric propulsion systems to enable transportation of the captured asteroid ; and the proposed human presence in cislunar space in the 2020s enabling exploration and exploitation of the returned asteroid			1
capturing an asteroid would also open up the possibility of mining it for its mineral wealth			1
this picture shows @entity76 , with its two " moonlets " @entity78 which was discovered in 1866 @entity1 declined to comment on the project because it said it was in negotiations with the @entity8 , but it is believed that technology would make it possible within 10 - 12 years			0
the technology would also open up the possibility of mining other asteroids for their metals and minerals			0
some are full of iron which could be used for in the making of new space stations , others are made up of water which could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen to make fuel			0
earlier this year @entity96 , a company based in @entity97 with billionaires including former @entity100 presidential candidate @entity99 and @entity102 's @entity101 and @entity103 among its investors , said it plans to mine ' near @entity58 asteroids ' within 10 years			0
the project would coincide the @entity109 project that in 2016 will see a spacecraft visit an asteroid called 1999 @entity112 and take samples of it back to @entity58			1
the captured asteroid could be transformed into a space station for astronauts to refuel at on their way to @entity6 ( pictured ) it is hoped that the project will increase our understanding of asteroids , and even shed new light on the origin of life on @entity58			1
the 1999 @entity112 is the most accessible organic - rich asteroid from the early solar system , its average diameter is approximately 1,600 feet or about the size of four football fields			1
the fact the asteroid is rich in carbon , a key element in organic molecules necessary for life , means it could explain more about the building blocks of life on our own planet			2
@entity100 space agency @entity1 has invited students from around the world to come up with a better name for the 1999 @entity112 a panel will review the proposed asteroid names and the @entity145 will approve the winning name			2
' our mission will be focused on this asteroid for more than a decade , " said @entity147 , principal investigator for the mission at the @entity149			2
' we look forward to having a name that is easier to say than repeated manned missions and that the undertaking would help build up experience for future jaunts into space			0
should any further space exploration take place , there 's a good chance that the astronauts will wear the new suit unveiled last week on the photo - sharing website @entity165			2
its design has led to parallels being drawn with the suit worn by @entity171 , the space ranger action figure			0
a large hemispherical transparent dome covering the wearer 's head also looks remarkably similar to that worn by @entity171 - although the latest pictures do not make clear if @entity1 's version comes pre-programmed catchphrases			0
how @entity1 's suit matches up to the @entity182 model : the latest pictures do not make clear if @entity1 's version comes pre-programmed catchphrases - but it otherwise looks remarkably similar the main advance in @entity1 's rather more primitive effort is that it will have an entry point at the rear to make it easier to don than previous suits			0
astronauts will be able to climb into it as quickly as you see in films , and not take an hour as they do now			0
the new suit will also effectively be its own airlock , dispensing with the need to spend time getting the pressure right			2
there will be better bearings on the legs , ankles , hips and waist to help astronauts move more naturally whilst a urethane - coated nylon and polyester layers control the pressure more efficiently			0
the ' @entity207 and @entity208 ( @entity208 ) 2.0 ' , to give it its full title , will hopefully be ready in the next couple of years .			0

a giant bag would be cast over it and it would be towed to new location
captured asteroid could provide stepping stone for exploration of @entity6
it would be first time a celestial object has ever been moved by humans
