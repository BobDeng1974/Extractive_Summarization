in an interview with @entity16 today , she has taken another stab at people who are overweight , saying : ' all fat people want is an excuse			1
but fatties have the one thing disabled people do n’t have			1
' there 's no stopping her ! @entity4 , who in her new show , went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and back again in six months , has hit out at overweight people again by saying that ' all fat people need is a kick up the a * * ' she went on to explain that she believes nobody is forcing these people to eat and maintains that she would raise the topic with a morbidly obese person if she saw them parking in a disabled spot			1
@entity4 , who added that ' all fat people need is a kick up the a * * * ' , is convinced that half of the @entity40 population secretly shares her views			1
on tuesday , however , @entity4 was reported to the police when she met up with the group of five women in @entity45 who all work independently as plus - size activists or diet bloggers , so that she could hear opposing views on her claims that ' fat people are lazy '			1
the panel included size acceptance campaigner @entity52 , burlesque performer @entity54 , blogger ' @entity57 ' , editor of @entity60 magazine @entity58 and vlogger @entity61 , who lost 11 stone in one year			0

@entity4 caused an uproar last year , when she told an obese woman on this morning that she would n't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy			1
but she decided to put her money where her mouth is with her latest project , by gaining and losing 3st to prove that overweight people are unwilling - rather than unable - to lose weight			0
the weight gain hit @entity4 's emotions harder than she expected , with the mother - of - three was often reduced to tears over her size , especially when she caught sight of herself in the mirror			2
she recently told @entity108 that she even refused to have sex with her husband @entity110 after she had gained the first stone , because she felt so unattractive			0
@entity4 originally weighed 8st 12lb ( right ) but ate her way to 11st 13lb ( left ) , then dropped back down again in just a few months to prove how easy it is to lose the flab @entity4 refused to be intimate with husband @entity110 , pictured , after she gained a stone in weight previously a slim size eight , weighing in at 8st 12lb at 5ft 7in , the 39 - year - old gained nearly 3st by gorging on 6,500 calories a day and severely limiting her movement			1

after a weight - gain diet that included daily ' snacks ' of a litre - and - a - half of @entity141 milk drink , an entire tub of @entity143 , cheese on toast , @entity146 and @entity148 chocolate and the inclusion of a second breakfast , @entity4 then cuts her calories to a mere 1,500			2
@entity4 found fame on @entity153 , left , and also enjoyed a stint in @entity155 in 2007 , right as well as a low fat diet of porridge , salads and lean chicken with a jacket potato , @entity4 upped her daily steps from 1,000 to 20,000 daily and introduced several hour - long runs a week			1

@entity4 kept a video diary during the making of the programme and regularly recorded her strong views on fat people			1
one video sees her explaining : ' one of the things about being fat and eating all the time is you find you do n't want to go out so much			0
you feel like you do n't really want to go out because you ca n't fit into the things you would like to wear			0
' i 'm not sure if that 's something many fat people suffer from because i see a lot of fat people out and about			1
whether that 's out of choice i do n't know but i 'm surprised that fat people go out at all			1

' i saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat			0
i just thought , we have to put an end to this			0
' while she now has greater sympathy for people with weight issues , @entity4 is continuing to be outspoken on the topics , using her @entity184 account to make digs at larger people in her neighbourhood			2
she recently tweeted : ' my local over / under active thyroid self help group meets in @entity218			0
' she also posted : ' i see you all down there with your excuses , but a third of the planet is obese			0
