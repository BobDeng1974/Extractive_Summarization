climate change alarmists have been likened to a fanatical ' cult ' by an @entity3 professor of meteorology			1
dr @entity5 told a @entity7 - based radio station that people who believe in global warming are becoming more hysterical in their arguments			1
' as with any cult , once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart , instead of saying , oh , we were wrong , they get more and more fanatical , ' he said			1
dr @entity5 ( right ) told a @entity7 - based radio station that people who believe in global warming ( stock pictured left ) are becoming more hysterical in their arguments			1
' as with any cult , once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart , instead of saying , oh , we were wrong , they get more and more fanatical , ' he said ' you 've led an unpleasant life , you have n't led a very virtuous life , but now you 're told , you get absolution if you watch your carbon footprint			1
' according to @entity30 at @entity31 , the 74 - year - old highlighted reports by @entity28 that 2014 was the hottest year in recorded history			2
he points out that the @entity28 climate scientists who made the claim was only 38 per cent sure this was true			0
' seventy per cent of the @entity37 is oceans , we ca n't measure those temperatures very well , ' he said			1
' they can be off a half a degree , a quarter of a degree			0
in 1990 , the @entity44 's climate panel predicted with ‘ substantial confidence ’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since			0
the @entity49 report found that , by the end of the century , the emission of greenhouse gases will bring temperatures that are about 3.7 ° c ( 6.7 ° f ) warmer the latest @entity49 ( @entity49 ) report was published in november			1
it said continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long - lasting changes			2
this will increase the likelihood of ' severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems			0
' such impacts include extreme weather and rising sea levels , heat waves , flooding and droughts			0
@entity71 , which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans , will harm marine life			0
without changes in emissions , ' climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century			0
' at the current rate , by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2 ° @entity81 ) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005			0
by the end of the century , that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7 ° c ( 6.7 ° f ) warmer			0
the impact on the @entity37 could already be considered dangerous , the report claimed			2
' even two - 10ths of a degree of change would be tiny but two - 100ths is ludicrous			0
anyone who starts crowing about those numbers shows that they 're putting spin on nothing			0
' dr @entity5 was a lead author of @entity99 , ' @entity95 , ' of the @entity96 on climate change			2
but he has previously blasted the @entity49 for blaming humans for a global warming trend that appears to have cooled in recent decades – and then glossing over the warming slowdown			1
' i think that the latest @entity49 report has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence , ' dr @entity5 told @entity108 – a site known for questioning the theory of global warming			1
a number of studies have suggested that powerful winds in the @entity115 , which have driven surface heat deep underwater , could be the reason behind the current ' pause ' in global warming			1
the @entity49 has said that rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species			2
it also claims that the world is in ' an era of man - made climate change ' and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans			1
on tuesday , president @entity130 said that ' no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change '			0
he has pledged that he would veto legislation turning back @entity137 efforts on the environment			0
since 1880 , @entity37 ’s surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees @entity140 ( 0.8 degrees @entity141 )			1
the @entity49 says rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species			2

comments were made by professor of meteorology , @entity5
' instead of saying , oh , we were wrong , they get more fanatical , ' he said
he says 70 *%* of the @entity37 is ocean , and measuring its temperature tricky
he has previously blasted the @entity49 for blaming humans for a global warming trend - and then glossing over the warming slowdown
