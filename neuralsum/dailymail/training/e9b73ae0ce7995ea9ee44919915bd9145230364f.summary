by @entity0 published : 04:05 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 06:05 est , 20 september 2012 an increasing number of @entity4 organisations are struggling financially with the number of debt - ridden trusts doubling in a year , a study has revealed			1
according to the @entity11 report , trusts and foundation trusts in the red rose from 13 in 2010/11 to 31 in 2011/12			2
this is more than one in 10 trusts in the @entity4			1
thirty - nine @entity4 trusts reported a poorer financial position in 2011/12 than in the previous year and 18 @entity4 trusts and foundation trusts received financial support from the @entity19 , the report states			1
however , it only gives the figures for the 10 debt - ridden @entity4 trusts that it audits			1
the other 21 organisations are @entity26 which are regulated by @entity27			0
monitor does not publish annual figures because it says many of these organisations intentionally run up a deficit as part of a longer - term plan			2
they argue that annual figures are an ' out - dated ' form of monitoring			0
this chart from the @entity11 shows the size of the debt of 10 @entity41 in 2011/12			0
the other 21 debt - ridden organisations are @entity26 and are regulated by monitor under pressure : @entity4 trusts face rising patient demands and costs a monitor spokesman said : ' foundation trusts have more freedom to run their own affairs than @entity4 trusts			1
as the independent regulator of the sector , we assess the financial health of @entity57 on their performance in the medium term and do not require them to break even each year			0
they are therefore allowed to run a short - term deficit , and from a business perspective this can be an acceptable method of managing their finances			0
' of the 21 fts operating a deficit in 2011 - 12 , 13 planned to be in deficit , nine are planning to return to surplus in 2012 - 13 , and five had deficits of less than £ 1m			0
' it comes during an unprecedented savings drive			1
in 2011/12 , the @entity4 as a whole made £ 1.6 billion in efficiency savings and a large number of trusts reported an improved financial position			1
@entity81 , managing director of health at the @entity11 , said : ' while nationally the @entity4 appears to be managing well financially , and preparing itself for the changes and challenges ahead , a number of @entity86 ( primary care trusts ) and trusts are facing severe financial problems			1
' the @entity19 and other relevant national authorities need to focus their attention on the minority of organisations whose financial position is deteriorating , and on their geographical distribution and service standards			0
' the @entity4 organisation with the highest deficit is @entity100 - which was put under the care of a special administrator earlier this year for being on the brink of bankruptcy			1
the trust , which provides care for patients living in the @entity109 boroughs of @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , was the first trust to be put on an ' unsustainable providers regime ' because it was losing £ 1 million a week			0
no decisions have yet been made about how the trust will be run in the future but recently @entity116 , the special administrator appointed to put the trust back on a viable footing , invited providers of @entity4 care , including private companies and @entity4 organisations , to express whether they would be interested in running services at the trust			2
the queen elizabeth hospital in @entity125 is one of three run by the @entity100 , which has the highest deficit in the country @entity130 chief executive @entity129 said : ' this is the time for the @entity132 to help providers , not with bailouts , but by releasing money to new clinical commissioning groups so they can work with providers to help put them on a sustainable footing by changing the type and range of services they provide			1
' now is the time for big investment in community and primary care			0
we need to do this to ensure hospitals can sustain local services in the long run			0
' fundamental changes to the way we provide care are necessary if the @entity4 is to maintain financial balance and become more responsive to patients ' needs			2
' doing this will require some difficult decisions and in some cases will require changing or closing down some services , but this can only happen if we build up the capacity in the community and in primary care to enable people to be treated at home			0
' dr @entity169 , chief executive and general secretary of the @entity171 , said : ' the @entity4 is tasked with saving £ 20 billion in @entity172 alone , and @entity4 hospitals and organisations are dealing with this reality on a daily basis			1
' patients will question why as many as 61,000 posts are at risk in the @entity4 when there is an overall surplus of £ 1.6 billion			2
to date , we have not seen evidence that this surplus is being reinvested into patient care , and a rigorous analysis of @entity4 finances is now needed			2
' we are also concerned that for those trusts who are running up huge deficits , often due to badly negotiated @entity193 deals , it can appear tempting to reduce expenditure by thoughtless reductions in staff and services			0
instead , they need to focus on keeping patients healthy			0
' a @entity19 spokesman said : ' we know the @entity4 is facing even greater pressures , not least from rising demand and costs			2
' that 's why we are investing an extra £ 12.5 billion in the @entity4 , modernising it and improving efficiency while at the same time improving choice for patients to drive up the quality of patient care			1

more than one in 10 @entity4 trusts are now in the red
follows unprecedented efficiency savings drive across all hospitals
@entity100 is @entity4 organisation with highest deficit
