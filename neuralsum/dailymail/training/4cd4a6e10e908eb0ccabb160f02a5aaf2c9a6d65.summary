despite suffering a broken neck that could have left him paralysed for life , 21 - year - old @entity22 hopeful @entity6 , has returned to gymnastics and is back competing @entity6 , who lives in @entity26 , @entity27 , underwent a four - hour operation two weeks later , and spent the following eight weeks wearing a neck brace which left him unable to exercise , causing him to lose a stone in weight			1
but after a remarkable turnaround , he was back in the gym in february and has since spent over 30 hours a week training in a 24 - hour gym			2
he said : ' the last thing i remembered was pushing from the vault , after that it was black			0
i had no idea what was happening and when i woke up in hospital i was told i 'd broken my neck			0
' it was a massive shock at first but it just made me determined and i refused to let it get me down			0
i was just focused on my recovery and focused on being a gymnast again			1
' an x-ray showing the neck fracture and dislodged vertebrae ( left ) and a scan after corrective surgery ( right ) @entity6 , originally from @entity53 in @entity54 , was practicing at his gymnastics club in @entity26 on august 7 last year when he performed a move which involved a handstand in which he would push off the vault and rotate twice in the air			1
his girlfriend , @entity60 , 22 , was travelling to the gym at the time to film his gymnastic sequence for a @entity65 montage			1
but as he started to turn mid-air , he accidentally opened up from the tightly curled ball he was in and plummeted to the floor , landing on his head in the foam safety pit			0
still smiling : @entity6 at the hospital before surgery ( left ) and after the four hour operation ( right ) determined : it has taken hours of rehabilitation and training in a 24 hour gym to regain strength after experiencing shooting pains he was immediately rushed to hospital where scans revealed the serious fracture and was operated on two weeks later			1
during the four hour operation surgeons fused the two dislocated vertebrae with a metal frame and bone from his hip , by moving his throat to one side			1
support : geoff with girlfriend @entity60 for months he was left incapable of moving his head and spent time recuperating at home			2
he said : ' the muscles in my neck had deteriorated so much i had to lift my head with my hands when i was lying down			0
' until december i could n't do anything apart from lie in bed at home			0
i was used to working out every day and instead had to sit down and watch the tv , it was so frustrating			0
' but i refused to accept that i would never be a gymnast again			2
' last december @entity6 started to gain strength and confidence using two ballet bars installed at his home and in february 2011 , his surgeon signed a letter allowing him to return to gymnastics			0
now after months of rehabilitation he is back on his feet and in the gym - and taking part in international competitions			2
he added : ' it has n't been easy and i have wanted to give up a few times			0
i wanted to feel a purpose to my life again and to get that confidence back			0
' if i make the @entity22 , it will be a miracle			1
i should be dead , or at least paralysed			0
' @entity6 - who was crowned @entity54 's national gymnastics champion last year - is now hoping to win a late call - up to @entity54 's @entity22 squad next summer if he gets to the final of this month 's competition .			1
