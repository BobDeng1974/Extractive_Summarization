@entity0 has all but ruled out the prospect of @entity2 signing @entity3 in january to ease their striker crisis			1
the @entity2 manager is reeling from the news that @entity7 is facing another six weeks on the sidelines , having broken down with a thigh problem on monday			1
@entity0 says @entity7 is ' as down as he has ever seen him ' and shattered by this latest setback			1
' he will go away now to see what we can do to get him on the football pitch			1
nobody wants that more than @entity7 , he is as down as i have ever seen anyone			1
' we need to look to find the answers to work consistently for @entity2			1
the @entity34 injury was one of a number			1
he has had nine injuries on that thigh , right through his career			1
' we are going to look across what has happened			2
he is a joy to work with			2
we want to get him fit and hopefully get him back			2
he had been back training , he had played in a practice game			2
it was a nothing action that caused the issue			2
it 's unfortunate for @entity7 , unfortunate for us but we can not cry about it			1
' all smiles for starlet @entity19 as he looks to enjoy himself while being put through his paces during the training session @entity2 boss @entity0 in talks with out - of - favour forward @entity62 ( left ) who is yet to score for the club since his summer move @entity0 looks in high spirits as he watches on while @entity62 ( right ) and skipper @entity13 train during the session @entity2 were prepared to offer more money if there was a chance of securing @entity73 's release from @entity74 in january and the @entity75 international , who signed for @entity2 for Â£ 10million earlier this year , had indicated he would be prepared to move to the @entity79 if a deal could be arranged			1
@entity0 , though , believes the chances of getting @entity73 are virtually non-existent and has insisted he will channel his energies into the players he has who are fit and available			1
' it was never the case of bringing him in early , ' explained the @entity2 boss			1
' the discussion last summer was that he had to stay			2
that was one of the reasons we got him			2
there has been a lot of speculation but the deal was in place that we would get him for next season			0
@entity2 return to @entity97 on sunday for the first time since they threw away a three - goal lead to draw 3 - 3 against them last season in a game that became to be known as ' @entity102 ' - in reference to @entity2 's famous recovery from a three - goal deficit during the @entity106 against @entity107 in @entity108			1
video we need to chip in with goals - @entity22 @entity110 , @entity25 , @entity22 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity13 and @entity113 are among those put through their paces @entity118 manager @entity0 watches on as his players are put through their paces during the session at @entity17 on friday @entity0 looks in high spirits as he shares a laugh and a joke with his training staff as they prepare for the game this weekend but @entity0 is not concerned that the memories of that will have any impact on his side this time round , despite admitting that the result was ' disappointing '			1
' our objective was to win the game , ' he said			0
' we were 1 - 0 up and then got a quick couple of goals			0
the excitement then took over			0
' on reflection after the game , i was proud of them for actually getting into that position in the league after i had got over the frustration and disappointment of the game			0
' it was n't the game that cost us			0
we played really well to get to 3 - 0			0
this is a new season , a terrific ground to go to			0
' it 's a game we are looking to get the victory in			0
we are looking to get the win			0
it is a difficult place to go			0
it has gone , we ca n't control what happened last season			0
' the players are giving me everything			0
we just hope we an find that extra one per cent			0
once you get the confidence , the wins start to flow			0

@entity0 plays down the prospect of signing @entity3 in january
@entity2 will be without @entity7 for @entity97 trip through injury
another setback leaves the @entity34 forward with another six weeks on the sidelines
@entity0 takes his side to face the @entity97 at @entity178 on sunday *afternoon*
