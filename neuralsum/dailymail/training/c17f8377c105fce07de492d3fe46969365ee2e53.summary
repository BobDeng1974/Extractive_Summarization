by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 5 june 2013 a giant lizard that lived up to 40 million years ago in the hot tropical forests of @entity3 has been named after @entity5 ' frontman @entity4			1
the ' lizard king ' dubbed @entity7 was six - foot long and weighed around 68 pounds - more than an average nine - year - old boy - and is thought to be one of the biggest known lizards ever to have lived on land			1
scientists from the @entity13 christened the lizard after @entity4 because he was known as the @entity4 , taken from his famous lyric ‘ i am the lizard king , i can do anything ' from the 1970 musical and poetry piece @entity17			1
this artist 's impression shows @entity22 , which means ' @entity4 's bearded king '			1
it was named after @entity4 , the singer of @entity5 whose nickname was the @entity4			1
this giant lizard roamed the tropical forests of @entity3 up to 40 million years ago and is believed to be one of the biggest known lizards ever to have lived on land			2
the lizard provides important clues about the evolution of plant - eating reptiles @entity34 singer @entity4 was the frontman for band @entity5 in the 1970s			1
his nickname was the @entity4 , taken from a lyric in the musical and poetry piece @entity17			1
this was the inspiration for the scientists at the @entity13 when choosing a name for a lizard that lived up to 40 million years ago			2
the scientists have been studying fossils of the lizard discovered in @entity45 to learn more about the mammal and the time in which it lived the @entity7 lizard lived between 36 and 40 million years ago in @entity3			1
fossils of the giant lizard were originally discovered in @entity45 in @entity45 scientists from @entity50 and @entity51 in the 1970s			2
paleontologists from the @entity13 have only recently began studying them			0
the jaw of @entity7 had ridges along the inside of its mouth that suggest the animal may have a had a skin flap in its throat			1
this suggests that the lizard was a plant - eater			2
it is thought to have been around six - foot long from nose to tail			1
and scientists believe it would have weighed about 68 pounds			2
the lizard is thought to have resembled modern - day bearded dragons , but around six times the size			2
it also had bones that are characteristic of chameleons and spiny - tailed lizards			0
the giant lizard 's genus name @entity7 means ' bearded king			1
' @entity7 was bigger than most of the mammals it would have lived with			2
this lack of predators and competitors meant it could grow bigger than other mammals			0
dr @entity86 , an assistant professor of @entity87 and atmospheric sciences at @entity13 and a curator in the @entity91 's @entity90 studied the fossils			0
@entity86 worked with @entity93 of @entity94 , @entity95 of @entity51 , and @entity96 of the @entity50 on identifying and analysing the lizard			0
@entity96 originally found the lizard 's fossils in @entity45 , @entity45 in the 1970s			0
but paleontologists from the @entity13 only began studying them recently			0
the discovery provides important new clues on the evolution of plant - eating reptiles			0
@entity7 was a herbivore but would have lived among both plant and meat - eating mammals around 36 to 40 millions years ago			1
dr @entity86 first noticed the creature 's bones were characteristic of a group of modern lizards that includes bearded dragons , chameleons and plant eaters like spiny - tailed lizards			0
the jaw of the @entity7 had ridges along the inside of its mouth that suggest the animal may have a had a skin flap in its throat			2
this suggests that the lizard was a plant - eater			2
it is thought to have been around six - foot long from nose to tail weighed about 68 pounds he said : ' i thought ' that 's neat			1
based on its teeth , it 's a plant - eating lizard from a time period and a place from which we do n't have a lot of information			2
' ' but when i started studying its modern relatives i realised just how big this lizard was			0
' it struck me we had something here that was quite large - and quite unique			0
' he also noticed ridges on the underside of the jaw that strongly suggested the lizard supported soft tissues , much like the multicolored chin flaps and dewlaps that give some modern lizards a bearded appearance			0
the @entity7 would have therefore resembled a modern - day bearded dragon , but at six times the size			1
asked about his decision to name the lizard after @entity4 , dr @entity86 added : ' i was listening to @entity5 quite a bit during the research			1
' some of their musical imagery includes reptiles and ancient places - and @entity4 was of course @entity4 - so it all kind of came together			1
' @entity86 from the @entity13 holds a fossil and fossil cast from the jawbone of @entity7 , a giant ancient lizard named after @entity5 musician @entity4			1
on either side of @entity86 are a mounted sailfin lizard that was closely related to @entity7 and a skeleton of a modern plant - eating iguana in modern - day environments plant - eating lizards such as iguanas and agamids are much smaller than large mammal herbivores			1
the largest lizards , such as the giant , carnivorous @entity191 , are limited to islands that are light on mammal predators			0
dr @entity86 said it 's not known if lizards are limited in size by competition with mammals or by temperatures of modern climates			0
' you ca n't fully understand the evolution of ecosystems in the modern world without looking at the ones that preceded them			0
' we would 've never known this by looking at lizards today			0
the @entity7 would have resembled a modern - day bearded dragon , pictured left , because of chin flaps and its shape , but is thought to have been six times the size			1
the name @entity7 also means ' @entity4 's bearded king '			1
ridges in the @entity7 's mouth suggest it was a plant - eater like the iguana , pictured right ' by going back in time using the fossil record , we can find unique information on the origin of modern ecosystems			1
' ' but we 're changing the atmosphere so fast that the rate of climate change is probably faster than most biological systems can adapt to			0
' so instead of seeing the growth and spread of giant reptiles , what you might see is extinction , ' he said			0
the researchers plan to use the fossils and the clues the bring to vritually reconstruct global temperature over geologic time periods			0
' that becomes very important in modeling what temperature change will be like across the surface of the planet in the future , ; @entity86 said			0
' and that , obviously , bears directly on our own health			0
' dr @entity86 's analysis will be published in @entity250			0

the six - foot reptile weighed more than *60* pounds and has been dubbed @entity7
it was named after @entity4 who was nicknamed the @entity4
@entity4 wrote the famous lyric ‘ i am the lizard king , i can do anything ' in the @entity17 song in 1970
