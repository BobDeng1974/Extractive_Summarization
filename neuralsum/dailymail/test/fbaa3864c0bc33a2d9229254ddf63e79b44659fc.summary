for most of us the thought of eating insects might prove to be one culinary step too far			1
but the consumption of locusts , crickets , worms and grubs could become very much a part of our diet as the cost of meat production rises , and the demand for meat grows			1

' in the future meat supplies might be a problem , ' presenter mr @entity42 says in the programme			1
' insects have been hailed as a solution to our meat problem ; full of protein , low in fat and packed full of nutrients they are already part of the staple diet in parts of @entity70 and @entity48			1
' the lack of traditional meat proteins can be put down to population expansion , food historian @entity43 explains			1
' as populations grow globally there is a huge pressure on the amount of meat that is produced because as developing countries start getting richer and people start adopting @entity77 - style diets , which tend to consume a lot more meat , ' she said			1
@entity86 ( eating insects ) could have a positive impact on the environment and world hunger if crunchy exoskeletons could replace typical meat			1
throughout the show , in the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner , knowing his leftovers would be their supper			2
the 1960s saw the birth of the sugary cereal , while motorway service stations became almost fashionable as places to eat			2

gourmet dishes and nouvelle cuisine took over from the simple but hearty dishes of earlier decades			0
by the 1990s , sushi and curry were as popular as traditional @entity121 dishes and ready meals became the norm			0

a recent @entity138 report identified edible insects as a sustainable food source for the future			1
figures indicate two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with them			0

chef @entity152 's pop - up restaurant @entity150 has a menu that begins with a starter of prawns and ants @entity46 restaurant chain @entity157 , which was co-founded in 2007 by @entity158 winner @entity157 , started to introduce the alternate protein source to diners in 2013			1
in january this year , it brought chapulines fundido to the menu , made with one of @entity46 's most sustainably farmed , yet unusual ingredients - grasshoppers			2
chefs cook the fried chapulines ( grashoppers ) with softened shallots , garlic and smoky chipotle chillies to create a salsa , which is served with queso fundido , a mixture of grated mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a side of corn tortillas			0
@entity157 gave @entity177 her take on the dish			0
she said : ' it 's just not in our psyche at the moment , but we do n't have any issues eating shrimps or prawns , so i think it 's just a question of creating a dish that will appeal over here			2
@entity46 restaurant chain @entity157 served chapulines fundido - made with grasshoppers - to its menu in january this year @entity194 restaurant in @entity195 has love bug salads , bushmans 's caviar ( caramel mealworms , blinis , coconut cream and vodka jelly ) and a dessert called @entity204 ( brown butter ice - cream , honey and butter caramel sauce and a baby bee ) on the menu			2

the 37 - year - old head chef says it will be the first restaurant in the @entity212 dedicated to serving insects as protein to show bugs can help feed the booming global population			1
@entity226 - @entity225 have a strong , bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce			0
@entity229 is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied @entity231 , so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours			2
@entity235 - match their nutty taste and light , crunchy texture with a crisp @entity240 wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness			0
@entity244 are normally eaten deep fried , so think similar to fish and chips			0
a lively full bodied @entity247 will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula			2
@entity250 - these worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour			0
@entity260 is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice @entity265 - @entity264 taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the @entity268 you 'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness			0
the @entity272 is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif			0
chocolate dipped locusts - these locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds , but also have the sweetness from the chocolate			0
a rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours			0
@entity287 - the meat inside the water bug 's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop , while the head has hints of anise , so you 'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours			1
a dry sherry , and a @entity301 at that , is the only choice here			0
the crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours			0
queen @entity307 - their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon			0
they would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes			0
a gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures			0
@entity226 - @entity225 have a strong , bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce			0
@entity229 is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied @entity231 , so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour			2
crickets - the flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt			0
nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full - bodied white wine like @entity331			2
@entity332 - have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture , therefore we recommend a creamy dry @entity336 that will match well with the earthy flavours ( similar to matching with mushrooms ) and crunch .			0

@entity17 's @entity341 claims that grubs are the future of food
the @entity347 family dig into cricket tacos , worm tarts and insect burgers
meat will become scarce or more *expensive* as demand for it grows
insects are full of protein , low in fat and packed full of nutrients
