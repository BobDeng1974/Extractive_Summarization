by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 19:05 est , 23 november 2012 @entity1 : the veteran @entity3 mp has warned against statutory regulation of the press @entity1 today becomes the most senior @entity3 figure yet to come out against statutory regulation of the @entity7			1
just days before the @entity9 is due to report , the former home secretary said there was no need to rush into legislation to ensure scandals such as phone hacking at the @entity15 do not happen again			1
he said that despite the fact he had ‘ suffered ’ at the hands of the media , he did not want to see anything that would ‘ change the terms on which we have a free press ’			2
the support for @entity24 from the former mp for @entity26 comes despite the fact that he resigned twice from @entity30 ’s cabinet following controversies in the media			2
in 2004 , he resigned as home secretary after he was accused of intervening to speed up the visa application of his former lover ’s nanny			1
an inquiry later found no evidence mr @entity1 had personally fast - tracked the application			1
a year later , he stepped down as @entity40			2
he was accused of failing to register shares he owned in a company bidding for contracts from his department – but was later found not to have breached the @entity47			2
mr @entity1 said he hoped newspapers would see the necessity of a strengthening of the existing @entity51 to ensure it has more ‘ teeth ’			1
if this happens , no laws would be needed , he said			2
his uneasiness at the prospect of statutory regulation of the press contrasts with his leader @entity59 , who has said that whatever @entity60 recommends should be implemented			1
the long - awaited report , out next thursday , is expected to call for some form of statutory regulation			1
a range of senior conservatives , including education secretary @entity66 and @entity68 mayor @entity67 , have spoken out against this			1
mr @entity1 made his comments on @entity72 ’s @entity71 at @entity74 programme , to be broadcast today at 11am			1
he was asked by host @entity75 why he is not ‘ one of those who want the government to act now ’			0
the former minister said he would prefer to see the @entity51 strengthened , rather than giving the state a role			0
‘ i think we all want a complete transformation of what currently is the @entity51 so that it actually does have teeth so it can provide redress , ’ he said			0
‘ i would like it not just to mediate , but to be able to make a judgment where the particular publication wo n’t play ball			0
i think we ’ve got a long way to go on the back of next week ’s announcement in persuading the media , the print media , to go along with something much tougher than is on the table			0
‘ and if we get that , we do n’t need statutory underpinning or requirements			2
and if we do n’t , we ’re in a different ball game			0
’ ' uneasiness ' : @entity60 is expected to call for a new press regulator backed by the law when his inquiry delivers its report next thursday mr @entity1 said it was not a question of just being in favour of statutory regulation of the press , or against			1
‘ i do n’t think we should be in two camps , ’ he said			0
‘ if you ’re not in favour of statutory regulation , you ’re somehow [ seen as ] a patsy of the media			1
‘ well , i ’m neither			0
i ’ve suffered myself but that does n’t mean retrospectively going over history i should want to change the terms on which we have a free press			2
’ asked whether statutory regulation of the @entity7 would risk undermining democracy , mr @entity1 replied : ‘ we ’ve got to use all the powers at our disposal not look immediately at legislation to do it			1
’ ' dictator ' : @entity128 's president @entity127 statutory regulation of @entity130 ’s @entity7 would be ‘ manna from heaven ’ for @entity127 and all the world ’s ‘ tinpot dictators ’ , a @entity128 newspaper chief warned yesterday			1
@entity136 , editor - in - chief of @entity128 ’s biggest independent newspaper , said it would be ‘ a very sad day indeed ’ if @entity60 recommended statutory underpinning of a new press watchdog			2
mr @entity136 issued his warning in a letter to the @entity144 pressure group			0
his newspaper , the @entity145 , was shut down by @entity127 for seven years and still has to operate under a state licence			0
he said : ‘ with regards to the @entity9 , it would be a very sad day indeed – not just for the @entity130 , but also for the @entity150 press , if not global media generally – if this were to lead to statutory regulation of the fourth estate			1
‘ many of the publishers and editors on the @entity159 continent that i ’ve discussed this unimaginable possibility with , worry that if the @entity130 does ill - advisedly take this route , it will be like manna from heaven for all the dictatorial regimes of the world			0
and we have a fair share of these tinpot dictators in @entity159			0
‘ indeed , i can only imagine the unrestrained joy that some people around president @entity127 would derive from such a backward step in the @entity130			0
if gold rusts , what about iron ? ’ the @entity145 is one of only two privately - owned newspapers in @entity128			0
stories critical of @entity127 have resulted in intimidation of journalists and it was only after he was forced to form a unity government in 2009 that independent newspapers were allowed to begin publication again .			0

@entity1 said there was no need to rush into legislation to ensure there is no repeat of the phone hacking scandal
