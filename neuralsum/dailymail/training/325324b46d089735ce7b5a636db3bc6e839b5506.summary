those who braved the freezing temperatures and turned up excited by the prospect of a repeat of last season 's thrilling fa cup final would leave bitterly cold and bitterly disappointed			1
unlike at @entity7 , last may , the magic glow was absent			2
and on a day of squad rotation , rare sightings , unexpected returns and cameo appearances , @entity8 relied on his two workhorses to extend a proud record in this competition			2
per @entity16 , criticised to the point of ridicule during recent defensive malfunctions , scored his first goal of the season while @entity22 celebrated his 16th with a high - energy display which makes a mockery of the idea all players are on their knees after the @entity30 programme			1

@entity77 : @entity80 , @entity48 manager : @entity92 5 @entity97 : @entity22 @entity98 : @entity99 5.5 @entity100 : 59,439 ratings by @entity102 at the @entity62 @entity8 has won the trophy five times , he has never been beaten in the third round and an upset never really seemed on the cards			1
@entity40 kept their first clean sheet in eight games to soothe the mental scars of their self - destruction on @entity112 at @entity113 , and @entity41 performed with an air of a team not too disappointed to crash out of a competition they almost won eight months ago			1
@entity92 made 10 changes , a clear hint that his priorities are elsewhere as his casualty list lengthens			0
@entity121 and @entity122 are his latest injury concerns , there is sickness in the squad and he was keen to rest midfielders @entity127 and @entity93 , who had clocked nearly 50 kilometres each in three games after @entity30			0
' it was n't a case of disrespecting the @entity35 because it gave us one of the best days of our lives last year , ' said @entity92 but , despite his protestations , the idea that it did n't matter if they lost seemed to have slipped into the minds of his players , if only subconsciously			0
the team selection confirmed what they knew already			0
survival in the @entity143 is the key			0
' it was a fair result , ' added @entity92			0
' we huffed and puffed but we had no cutting edge to bring the tie alive			0
we did n't create any real chances , and there was not enough in the final third which is a bit disappointing			2
' @entity8 picked a stronger team , but then he had few options			0
he would have liked to have rested @entity22 , he confessed but could not afford to with @entity156 banned , @entity155 injured and @entity157 in @entity158 completing his loan move to @entity160			2
mertesacker has started 27 of his team 's last 28 @entity40 games and was one of only survivors from the team @entity8 picked at @entity7 in may			2
@entity22 made his 28th start of the season			1
' he recovers very quickly and does n't look to have fatigue problems , according to our tests , ' said @entity8 , who must hope the tests are accurate			0
any injury to @entity22 would be a devastating blow to @entity40 's season			1
' i was tempted to rest him but @entity156 was suspended and this was an important game for us , ' @entity8 added			0
' he feels always ready and when you look at the players with that confidence you are always torn between keeping them playing and giving them a rest			0

he took the corner for the first goal and scored a goal			2
he was lively and penetrating			0
and he is interesting to watch because he has a good fighting spirit			0
' @entity22 created the first chance of the game - @entity69 was denied by @entity79 - and took the corner from which @entity16 leapt above @entity234 to nod @entity40 into the lead			1
he also skipped around @entity79 , moments later , only for @entity80 to summon a terrific sliding clearance			0
it was @entity80 's first appearance in two months since a row with @entity92 which deepened when the defender took it onto social media			0
' he played very , very well , he 's apologised and it 's over , ' said the @entity41 manager			2
as @entity40 dominated , @entity79 saved again from @entity67 , who started for the first time since last season 's @entity35 third round tie against @entity246 when he damaged cruciate knee ligaments and still appeared short of full power			1
@entity40 limited @entity41 to occasional counter-attacks and threats from set - pieces and @entity92 spent much of the game shaking his head and muttering under his breath			1
@entity85 fired wide in the first - half and both @entity80 and @entity81 saw headers saved by @entity63 , in goal for @entity40 as @entity258 was rested			1
@entity41 offered more adventure after the interval but again @entity79 was the busier keeper , saving another low strike from @entity22			1
@entity69 and @entity67 wasted good chances before @entity22 settled the nerves , eight minutes from time when he twisted into space on the edge of the @entity41 penalty box and swept a low shot inside the post			1
the @entity35 holders are into the fourth round and only @entity273 and @entity274 have more goals for top - flight teams than @entity22			1
' well , there 's no sign of him being tired , ' said @entity92			0
' he 's world class and his appetite and desire is what every player should look at			0
' perhaps he was thinking of some of his own players when he said this			0
@entity287 manager @entity92 ( right ) appeals to his players as @entity40 start the second half slowly @entity67 's first touch lets him down as the @entity293 forward misses an opportunity to double @entity40 's lead @entity40 playmaker @entity59 ( left ) gave a typically creative performance from midfield man of the match @entity22 ( left ) scored a stunning late goal to seal victory for @entity40 sanchez wheels away after scoring his 16th goal of a sensational debut season for the @entity194 the @entity45 forward is congratulated by @entity40 team - mate @entity44 as the @entity194 go through to the next round @entity41 captain @entity48 leads his players in applauding the fans after seeing his side crash out of the @entity35			1

@entity69 and @entity22 came close for the hosts during a dominant opening performance
@entity194 captain @entity16 opened the scoring with a towering header from a first - half corner
