@entity0 are prepared to spend another £ 20million in the january transfer market			1
the areas they are particularly scouting for are centre half , defensive midfield and left back			1
they will weigh up marquee players , budget ones and those with potential			0
here @entity11 highlights just how much bang for his buck @entity15 may be able to find			0
video @entity15 acting coy when discussing @entity18 last transfer window @entity15 knows his defence needs reinforcements but he is working on a tight budget in january @entity23 ( @entity22 ) cost £ 8m @entity22 do not want to sell @entity23 in january and disrupt their promising season			1
he is out of contract in the summer but the £ 8m price tag will reflect their desire to keep him			0
not a typical @entity0 player but has @entity31 experience , wants to defend and is a threat at set - pieces , which the @entity34 have been lacking			1
@entity23 would not be a cheap solution , but he has the benefit of @entity31 experience @entity23 has been excellent for @entity22 over the past few seasons , and his power in the air would be vital @entity18 ( @entity40 ) £ 6m @entity18 is a player that could change @entity0 ’s future and is vastly experienced despite still only being 27			1
@entity40 will consider selling in january if he continually stalls on a new contract and have already targeted his compatriot @entity45 , 23 , of @entity46			0
all the big clubs are interested and big wages are an issue - but they should be worth paying			0
adding @entity50 - winning midfielder @entity18 would be a massive boost for @entity0 in january the @entity40 star would be available for the cut price of £ 6million , but his wages might be a sticking point @entity57 ( @entity56 ) cost £ 6.5m talks have been opened with the midfielder ’s agents and they are hopeful of agreeing a deal with @entity0 but decisions do n’t come quickly at the @entity63			1
@entity64 has played as a playmaker and attacking midfielder but the @entity34 believe he can play a more defensive role			1
room for improvement at 21 and cheaper than @entity70 at @entity71			0
@entity64 is already in talks with the @entity34 , but it remains to be seen if the deal gets done in january @entity75 ( @entity76 ) cost £ 12million @entity0 have made enquiries for @entity75 and @entity76 will sell at the right price as they are actively looking for another centre back themselves in anticipation the @entity82 defender will leave			1
there is interest from @entity85 also with @entity86 and @entity87 among his admirers			0
would fit into @entity0 ’s style			2
@entity75 ( left ) would fit into @entity0 's style , but at £ 12million his injury problems could be a concern @entity94 ( @entity93 ) cost £ 12m @entity94 may be out of contract next summer but the price again reflects @entity93 ’s dire need to keep him			1
@entity0 will also face competition from @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , who are weighing up defensive changes			1
@entity94 has the ability and physical presence to fit in comfortably at the @entity63			2
@entity94 ( right ) would bring more solidity to the @entity0 defence , but there are several interested teams @entity110 ( @entity100 ) cost £ 16m @entity100 refused to sell @entity110 to @entity0 in the summer and will not let the @entity112 centre half go at this stage either with a lack of defensive cover			1
it is fair to say that @entity117 is continually taking stock of his defenders and @entity110 ’s injury record continues to hinder his development			0
@entity110 was sent off in last month 's @entity122 , but is still not central to @entity117 's plans @entity0 have enquired about @entity110 before but with @entity100 lacking cover , he wo n't be allowed to leave @entity125 ( @entity126 ) cost £ 8m has impressed in @entity127 and during @entity126 ’s @entity129 campaigns but there are doubts whether he is at the level to seriously improve upon @entity0 ’s deficiencies			2
he is good on the ball and scores goals but may lack the extra quality to make a difference to their current squad			0
@entity126 's @entity125 has an eye for goal and has impressed in domestic and @entity129 football there remain questions over whether @entity147 would dramatically improve @entity0 's options @entity150 ( @entity149 ) cost £ 7m tall , powerful looking left back who has caught the eye of a number of @entity31 scouts and was the subject of a bid from @entity157 in august			1
he continues to impress at @entity149 and has good character and potential to switch to centre back			1
very good potential but not quite ready			0
@entity160 has impressed during his time at @entity149 , but is still a prospect rather than a ready - made star @entity164 ( @entity165 ) £ 20m @entity0 have been joined at the hip by @entity168 scouts at most of @entity170 ’s games since he made his breakthrough at @entity172			2
powerful presence who can dominate midfield but @entity165 ’s prised possession wo n’t come cheap			0
@entity15 also looked at 19 - year - old clubmate @entity177 who is out of contract soon but injuries have dogged him			0
@entity0 have been watching @entity170 closely , but could face competition from the likes of @entity168 @entity182 is a powerful midfielder , but is likely to cost @entity0 all of their £ 20million budget in january @entity185 ( @entity186 ) £ 15m @entity0 do n’t need a striker but that has n’t stopped them looking at @entity186 ’s @entity189 who is the top scorer in @entity190 with 11 goals			2
a target for @entity193 and @entity194 , he has also been watched by @entity101 in recent weeks			0
ready - made for @entity0 but only really required should they sell			2
@entity195 has been superb so far this season in @entity190 , but do @entity0 need another forward ? one to ponder ... @entity198 ( @entity199 ) cost £ 34m ( buy - out clause ) stylish centre back with plenty of admirers			1
@entity204 - born but has been in @entity199 ’s youth system since the age of 16			0
still raw but plenty of potential			0
@entity100 and @entity208 are contemplating bids but @entity199 will not negotiate - it ’s buy - out clause only and that will keep @entity0 at bay for now			2
@entity199 defender @entity198 ( right ) would cost a massive £ 34m , but @entity0 are interested			2

@entity0 want to buy a centre back , left back and defensive midfielder
@entity34 defensive *frailties* have been exposed so far this season
@entity23 , @entity18 and @entity94 among the potential targets
