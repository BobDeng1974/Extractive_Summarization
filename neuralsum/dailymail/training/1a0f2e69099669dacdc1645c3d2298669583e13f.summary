by @entity0 and @entity1 when @entity2 was a child and people asked about his mother , he 'd give them an answer he knew would preclude any further questions : she died in a car crash			1
in fact , his mother was alive and well , only instead of baking cookies and helping with homework , she was barefoot and mostly naked , with sticks coming out of piercings in her face , gathering grubworms and roasting boa constrictors deep in the @entity17 jungle			0
@entity2 's mother was never the suburban mom she tried to be			1
her name is @entity20 , and she is part of the @entity23 tribe from @entity24			1
' i did n’t want to be known as a half - breed			0
and it was my revenge ; i was angry that she left me			0
so i just wanted to stick with the story that she was dead			0
' good is one of three children born to @entity20 and @entity39 , an anthropology professor who encountered the @entity41 more than 30 years ago as a student and returned so frequently that he was regarded as a part of the tribe			1
@entity39 was supposed to be there for 15 months , but instead became enamored of the culture and spent 12 years there , on and off			1
along with his acceptance into the tribe , @entity39 was offered a wife			1
although she was only in her early teens , @entity26 was promised to @entity39 and the two were married			1
@entity39 eventually returned to the @entity53 , bringing @entity20 with him , but it was n't easy			1
everything was alien to the young woman , who had to learn to count because the entire @entity23 numerical system consisted one ' one , ' ' two , ' and ' many			2
' having never experienced any type of technology , she was confused and at times frightened , believing cars to be ferocious animals and struggling through @entity65 lessons			0
there were discoveries too : @entity26 loved traffic jams , gold chains , country fairs and action films			2
@entity39 once had to cancel the family 's pay - per - view when he received a sizeable bill because @entity26 had watched @entity74 seven times			1
but @entity26 felt isolated , spending most of her time in the couple 's @entity77 , @entity79 , home watching tv , unable to communicate with anyone but her husband			1
in 1991 , @entity39 made a deal with @entity85 to film a documentary of the entire family returning to @entity24 , including @entity2 and his younger siblings @entity89 and @entity90			1
nuclear family : @entity20 and @entity39 with two of their children @entity2 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) adjustment : @entity26 had to adjust to a @entity96 way of life when she moved to @entity79 with @entity39 , a task that eventually proved too difficult while they were there , @entity26 made the painful decision not to return to the @entity53			1
' after two or three years , i began internalizing it as abandonment , ' @entity2 told the @entity33			2
' sometimes i would bring @entity26 up , ' @entity39 said			1
' and when i did - dead silence			0
i thought , " well , that ’s strange			0
" ' once , when @entity2 was about 10 years old , his class took a field trip to the @entity110 where he saw a blown - up photo of his mom , taken by his dad on the wall as part of a tribal exhibit			1
' i just froze , ' @entity2 told the @entity33			2
' all the blood drained out of me			0
i ran to a dark corner and hid for 10 minutes			0
' finally , after a tumultuous adolescence where he self - medicated with drugs and alcohol and internalized his pain over his mother , @entity2 read a book his father had written about his experiences with @entity26 and the @entity23 tribe called @entity129			1
he was 20 and finally ready to hear his mother 's side of the story			2
in 2011 , he left to @entity53 to visit the @entity41			1
it had been 19 years since @entity2 had seen @entity26			1
the @entity135 graduate student did n't know what to expect			0
home : when @entity2 went to visit his mother , he did n't even know if she was alive and well , because the @entity41 do n't have any contact with the world outside their tribe prior to that summer trip , it had been years since @entity2 left the @entity53 — the last time as a small child on the fateful trip in which he would lose his mother to her tribe			1
the trip to @entity24 involved two years of coordination			1
once there , @entity2 had to navigate the @entity151 with a tour guide and translator , deep into the @entity17 rainforest , where few outsiders venture			2
living so remotely , @entity26 was cut off from all forms of modern communication , and therefore @entity2 had no way of knowing if she was even alive			1
the trip changed @entity2 's life			1
' that trip was all about uncertainty , ' @entity2 told the @entity33			1
' i did n’t know if she would like me , or if i would like her , or if she would reject me			0
' when she emerged from the jungle , @entity2 recognized his mother 's face immediately			1
he did n't hug or kiss her - it 's not the @entity23 way - but he told her something he 'd wanted to say for years			1
' i said , " @entity172 , i made it , i ’m home			0
it took so long , but i made it			0
" ' they both cried			0
good , then 27 , was exposed to a way of life he never experienced in the @entity53			2
he was struck by the bare - bones nature of the tribe			0
everything in their lives — food , shelter , the baskets they weave and arrows they make — comes from the land			0
in the middle of the rainforest , without the distractions of technology and demands of a global society , there was only the ' simple essence of human communication , ' @entity2 explained			2
good has since made it his mission to address the needs of indigenous groups like the @entity23 , and to educate the world about their way of life			2
' i want to rectify the world 's image of them			0
you still hear so many stereotypes , like they are " primitive , " ' @entity2 said			2
embracing heritage : since he first revisited his mother , @entity2 has become more and more enamored of the @entity23 way of life bridging the gap : in his unique position as a @entity23 , @entity2 is helping to preserve the culture while bringing in necessities such as medicine in august , he started @entity227 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to these goals			1
the organization is part of @entity135 's @entity231			2
in december , the group registered as a nonprofit in @entity234 , and it is applying for its 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status			0
in november , @entity2 did make another return trip to the @entity17 , staying in his mother 's village , @entity241 - @entity240 , for more than a month			1
he also took a weeklong trip to @entity243 to study and visit with the @entity245 tribe , one of the most remote groups in @entity243			2
on may 24 , he left for his first official trip with @entity227 , returning to the @entity245 village along with four @entity135 students to continue his outreach there			0
right now , he plans to focus @entity227 's mission specifically on these two tribes			0
it 's really difficult for remote populations such as the @entity256 and @entity41 to receive basic necessities like clothing and medicine			1
good hopes to bring supplies to these groups , but also wants to help preserve the @entity245 and @entity41 way of life and find out exactly what the tribes ' people need			2
he is interested in ethnography — staying with the tribes for an extended period of time to ' walk in their shoes ' and learn about their daily struggles			0
while @entity2 does n't plan to spend as much time in the villages as his father did with the @entity23 , he would like to take extended trips between three to six months			1
mother and son : the @entity23 have no word for love , but as @entity286 gives her son @entity2 a haircut it 's clear the pair are family new beginnings : after a long separation , @entity2 ( carried by father @entity39 ) and his mother @entity26 ( left ) are building a relationship he also hopes to bring others with him , particularly people in the @entity297			1
the group of @entity135 students traveling to @entity243 in may is a diverse one , ' which is exactly what i wanted , ' @entity2 said			2
the group consists of a nursing major , biology major , math major and computer science major			0
for an outsider , experiencing a third world culture for the first time is shocking , he said			0
' as @entity53 , we just want to figure out how to go at them and solve them , but they are n't really poor in spirit , ' @entity2 said of the remote tribes			1
the tribes are free from many problems faced by modern society , such as depression , suicide and even diseases like cancer			0
in fact , @entity2 says he feels happiest at home in the @entity17 rainforest			2
' i never felt any happier than being alone in my hammock , rocking next to the fire at the end of a hard day 's work in the garden , ' he said			0
' they are self - sufficient , they just live with less			0
' when he 's with his mother , he lives just as she does			0
' my dad tells me not to walk around barefoot in my underwear , but i want to , ' @entity2 says			0
he eats grub worms , termites , boa constrictors , monkeys , armadillo			0
' i really want to be @entity41 , ' @entity2 says			1
' i want to trek through the jungle like they do			0
' he and @entity26 are slowly building a relationship after so many years and a culture apart			2
' it ’s not like there ’s closure , ' @entity2 said			0
' we ’re at the beginning of our story , in so many ways			0

@entity2 saw his mother @entity26 for the first time since he was six in 2011
she is part of the @entity23 tribe of @entity24
@entity2 's father @entity39 met @entity26 while an anthropology student studying her tribe
@entity26 lived in suburban @entity79 with @entity39 and their three children
on a trip back home , she decided not to return to the @entity53
@entity2 saw a picture of her in the @entity372 when he was 10
he used to tell people she was dead because he was *embarrassed* , but is now embracing his @entity41 culture
