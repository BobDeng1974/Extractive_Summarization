@entity0 has caused controversy with concerns its recording capability is a breach of privacy @entity0 users have been warned they risk breaking the law by using the devices to film people secretly			1
the data privacy watchdog has told buyers of the £ 1,000 ‘ wearable technology ’ that they could be prosecuted if they mis - use recordings , or face fines of up to £ 500,000			1
the @entity15 said wearers are effectively covered by the same rules as cctv cameras , meaning they can not record people on their glasses and show the films publicly unless they have consent			0
the warning comes after the devices went on sale in @entity26 for the first time this week			0
@entity28 , senior technology officer , warned that using the recording capability of @entity0 for anything other than personal use was forbidden unless the wearer had given warning in advance			1
much like a smartphone , the wearable @entity0 provides information and recordings via a display screen inside the glasses ' lens			1
by issuing the voice command ' ok , @entity0 ' - said to have been the brainchild of @entity46 co-founder @entity45 's new girlfriend - you can activate it and then issue voice commands , including recording video and taking photographs			1
@entity68 the term @entity46 has given to @entity0 users			1
as the company rolls out its early version for the general public , those willing to be among the first to use it have been marketed as pioneering revolutionaries whose purchase will contribute to the final product 's design			0
ok , @entity0 the phrase a @entity0 wearer uses when wearing the product to activate the glasses and issue a voice command			1
glass hole an obvious spin on the more common phrase for someone who is a pest , obnoxious , rude or a jerk - specifically , one wearing @entity0			2
glass out the term given to those who appear to be staring vacantly into the distance while they are focusing on their @entity0 display screen			2
this falls under @entity46 's ' do not ' category and is considered poor etiquette			0
this is because the laws include an exemption for the collection of personal information for domestic purposes			0
' but if you were to one day decide that you ’d like to start using this information for other purposes outside of your personal use , for example to support a local campaign or to start a business , then this exemption would no longer apply			0
' he warned that organisations ' use of wearable technology were an entirely different proposition to individuals			2
' they must process the information collected by these devices in compliance with the legislation , ' he said			0
' this includes making sure that people are being informed about how their details are being collected and used , only collecting information that is relevant , adequate and not excessive and ensuring that any information that needs to be collected is kept securely and deleted once it is no longer required			0
' if the organisation was recording video or pictures , then it must consider the issues raised in the @entity134 , he said			2
the product 's rollout in the @entity64 has been far from smooth , with reports of users being publicly assaulted and @entity140 bars banning the product due to concerns from their patrons about being filmed without their consent			0
@entity46 said : ' we designed @entity0 with privacy in mind and given the similarities between the functionality of a smartphone and glass we expect the same rules to apply			1
the fact that @entity0 is worn above the eyes and the screen lights up whenever it ’s activated clearly signals it ’s in use and makes it a fairly lousy surveillance device			2

privacy watchdog warns of legal issues when using @entity0
individuals and organisations should be wary of how recordings are used
*punishment* for breaking law a fine of up to £ 500,000 or *criminal* prosecution
