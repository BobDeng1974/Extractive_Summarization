@entity0 has insisted @entity1 is the right man to take @entity2 to the @entity3 in february , while admitting it is ‘ ridiculous ’ to suggest no one is ‘ unsackable ’			1
as the tourists left @entity9 ’s hill - country this morning for @entity10 and , on tuesday , their final game of cricket in 2014 , it was sobering to reflect that the same questions were swirling around @entity1 ’s leadership when they played their first game of the year at @entity16 back in january			1
the questions then concerned the @entity18 job ; now it is about the one - day position			2
@entity1 remains under pressure after another disappointing performance for @entity2 @entity1 said his dropping of @entity25 's @entity24 on 41 was a ' really costly drop ' @entity1 takes the field for what would be a tough day at the office for the @entity2 captain in the sixth odi but the storyline has been a constant , and the @entity2 coach did his best to play down suggestions that there remained any doubt about @entity1 ’s @entity3 role			1
in that , he was not always successful			0
‘ it has n’t changed , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ @entity1 is announced as captain of our @entity3 team			2
but i ’ve said on every tour we go on , it will be wrong not to go back and look at everything that ’s happened with the other selectors			0
‘ that ’s the way it should be			0
it ’s fair to the public that way			0
we ’ll do exactly the same this time			0
but @entity1 is our captain , and nothing has changed on that front for the moment			2
’ confusion arose following an interview @entity0 gave to @entity59 on @entity60 after saturday ’s 90 - run thrashing by @entity25 in @entity62 , a result that left @entity2 4 - 2 down and with only pride to play for in @entity10			1
@entity0 told @entity59 that @entity2 would review ‘ everything ’ at the end of the series – a comment in which it was possible to read a lack of unequivocal support for his captain			1
this morning , it was still possible to read between the lines			0
‘ @entity1 has said very clearly that he is very keen to carry on , and wants to remain as captain of @entity2 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he knows nobody has got the guarantee of that			0
i hear someone say no one ’s unsackable			2
that would be a ridiculous comment			0
‘ we ’ve got four selectors , and we always pick what we think is the best team – and that will be no different moving forward			0
’ @entity0 insisted @entity1 is the right man to lead @entity2 at next year 's @entity3 @entity24 leaves the field in @entity9 for the final time after spearheading @entity25 's 90 - run @entity31 win the keeper - batsman 's team - mates ensure their veteran leads them off the field after clinching the series it is more likely , amid the current climate of dissatisfaction at @entity1 ’s batting and @entity2 ’s one - day results , that @entity0 is simply trying to avoid being seen to rubber - stamp the future of a struggling captain			1
talk of being ‘ fair to the public ’ feels like a bit of a sop : it is only eight days since @entity1 was confirmed as @entity3 captain , and it would be an embarrassing admission of failure by the management to change their minds now			2
@entity112 may also be reluctant to pre-empt the discussion he will have after this is over with fellow selectors @entity115 , @entity117 and @entity118			0
whichever way you look at it , however , it seems inconceivable that @entity1 will not captain @entity2 in @entity124 and @entity125 , despite scoring a single half - century in his last 21 one - day internationals			1
and @entity0 was on firmer ground when he spoke of the progress made by others here in @entity25			1
‘ we ’ve had some real bonus performances by people – @entity134 at the top of the order , @entity130 played beautifully again – but we need to put the bowling , batting and fielding together at the same time			0
‘ we ’ve got to get that right by the tri-series [ against @entity124 and @entity140 ] and , obviously , moving into that @entity3			0
’ try as @entity0 might , though , the @entity1 question is likely to rumble on			1
rarely can an @entity2 captain have approached the seventh match of a one - day series in such desperate need of a score			1
after putting down @entity24 , who got 112 , @entity1 was out lbw to @entity147 for just one			1

@entity2 captain @entity1 dropped @entity24 on 41
the @entity25 left - hander went on to make a run - a - ball 112
@entity25 beat @entity2 by 90 runs in their sixth odi in @entity62
@entity1 remains under *considerable* pressure after his showing ]
@entity2 coach @entity0 admitted no - one is unsackable
