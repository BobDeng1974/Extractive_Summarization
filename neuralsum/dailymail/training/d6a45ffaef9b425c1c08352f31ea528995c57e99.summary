the first outburst came last november when preachers told mosque congregants that it was appropriate for @entity26 to celebrate @entity28 holidays such as the @entity29 and @entity30 , causing @entity2 to stand up and argue			1
the second was this past january			2

@entity56 , a member of the mosque 's board of trustees , told a @entity77 reporter that 26 - year - old @entity2 , who died early friday morning after a shootout with police , was an infrequent attendee for about a year - and - a - half , while 19 - year - old @entity80 , who was captured hiding in a boat in @entity82 on friday night , attended only once			1
responding to the revelation that both brothers had attended their mosque , the @entity16 issued a statement to say that while the suspects were known to other worshipers , they could not have predicted their horrific bombing of the @entity54 which claimed three lives and injured over 180 people			1
@entity92 , of the @entity16 , the city 's largest mosque , said in an interview that he had recently heard of the incident			2
' that 's a sign right there that his views are n't mainstream , ' @entity92 said			2
they pledged to aid federal and city law enforcement to leave ' no stone uncovered in finding any suspects connected to the bombs			2
' @entity106 , uncle of @entity109 suspect brothers , @entity80 and @entity2 believes ' they were just puppets and executors of something of bigger scale ' the brothers are believed to have placed one of the bombs near to a @entity4 store where their mother had been sacked for stealing clothes yesterday the brothers ¿ mother , @entity120 , said the @entity121 once told her that @entity2 was ¿ really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him ' meanwhile , the @entity2 bother 's uncle @entity106 , who described the pair as ' losers ' after they were named as suspects , raised the worrying possibility that they were radicalized by a domestic source and not a foreign one			1
the lawyer said that @entity2 especially had fallen under the thrall of an as - yet unidentified religious leader while living in @entity49 , @entity131			1
@entity106 says he grew concerned about @entity2 when he told him in a 2009 phone conversation that he had chosen ' @entity134 's business ' over work or school			1
@entity106 said he then contacted a family friend who told him @entity2 had been influenced by a recent convert to @entity138			1
' there certainly were mentors , ’ ’ @entity106 said to the today show			2
' i was shocked when i heard his words , his phrases , when every other word he starts sticking in words of @entity134			2
i question what he ’s doing for work , ( and ) he claimed he would just put everything in the will of @entity134			0
[ caption ' it was a big concern to me			0
he called me ' confused ' when i started explaining to him , make yourself useful to yourself and to your family and maybe you ’ll have extra to share with everybody else			0
' ' i strongly believe they were just puppets and executors of something of bigger scale , ' @entity106 told @entity162			0
the @entity164 resident told his nephew that ' he was giving up on everything , struggling with your own shadow ' by wholeheartedly turning to @entity169			0
' he had been sort of brainwashing him , ' @entity106 told the @entity170 of @entity171			0
the brothers ' parents told @entity174 they believe their sons were framed and @entity106 said a family acquaintance told him there was an outside influence on @entity179			2
' he said there is someone who brainwashed him , some new convert to @entity138 , ’ ’ @entity106 said			0
“ i would like to stress ( the acquaintance was ) of @entity184 descent			0
’ the uncle also speculated that @entity2 ’s younger brother , @entity67 , was manipulated into the bombing plot			1
' @entity67 is just a kid who wanted to have older brother to look up at			0
except for being a murderer , he ’s been a loving brother			0
' ' that so - called radicalization was seeded right here , not in the @entity191 , not in @entity22 , not in @entity192 , which he has nothing to do with , ' @entity106 said			0
the extremist views which @entity2 developed over the course of the past three years caught the attention of @entity22 security officals who asked the @entity121 to question him in 2011 - before he traveled to @entity192 and @entity198 last year			1
the @entity121 are said to have discovered nothing incriminating during their conversations with @entity2			1
however , friends said that @entity2 became increasingly vocal in his views , especially concerning @entity203			1
the @entity204 spoke more of the truth then the @entity206			0
he said the @entity206 was used as an excuse to invade other countries , ' said @entity209 , 18 , a student at @entity210 , which the bombers also attended according to the @entity212			0
and it has been revealed today that @entity2 had direct contact with @entity216 terrorists – and was ‘ monitored ’ by investigators for five years			1
the @entity121 put @entity2 , 26 , under surveillance after receiving an explicit warning from the @entity22 intelligence services			1
rebel : one theory is that @entity2 was inspired by @entity223 , a @entity216 terrorist known as @entity22 's @entity224 @entity223 has recently widened his fight for @entity216 independence to a wider @entity228 agenda but despite apparently telling his mother that @entity2 was an ‘ extremist ’ leader , the @entity121 eventually discounted the possibility that he was a threat			2
yesterday the brothers ’ mother , @entity120 , said the @entity121 once told her that @entity2 was ‘ really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him ’			1
she added : ‘ he was controlled by the @entity121 for five years			0
they knew what my son was doing			0
they were following every step of his			0
’ and his father , @entity240 , said investigators warned his son : ‘ we know what sites you are on , we know where you are calling , we know everything about you			0
we are checking and watching			0
’ @entity22 's @entity224 @entity223 was believed to be behind the @entity249 bombing in 2010 which killed at least 40 despite all this , the @entity121 found no substantive evidence that he was engaged in terror - related activities though they continued to ‘ monitor his internet use and contacts ’			0
according to an intelligence source , @entity22 remained convinced that @entity2 , an ethnic @entity216 , was in ‘ direct contact ’ with @entity259 militants , most likely based in the strife - torn southern @entity22 region of @entity198 , where he lived for two years with his family prior to moving to the @entity28			1
during a six - month visit to @entity22 last year – a trip @entity28 investigators are investigating – it is understood @entity2 visited @entity198 , which is now regarded as more unstable than @entity192			1
one theory is that @entity2 and @entity67 , who was in thrall to his older brother , may have been ‘ inspired ’ by a rebel leader known as @entity22 ’s @entity224			2
a light beam from a helicopter , top right , aims in the direction of @entity82 , where officials searched for @entity80 on friday @entity80 is apprehended on friday evening after almost 24 - hours on the run following a week of terror in @entity4 @entity223 , like the @entity2 brothers , is an ethnic @entity216 from the war - torn @entity191 that lies between @entity279 and @entity280			1
he has been accused of masterminding some of the worst terrorist atrocities in @entity22 , including suicide bombings carried out by two women on @entity285 ’s metro system in 2010 which killed at least 40			0
significantly , while @entity223 was originally fighting only for @entity216 independence he has more recently embraced a wider jihadist agenda			0
it raises the terrifying prospect of further atrocities being carried out across the globe by disaffected individuals inspired by the jihadist rhetoric of the former @entity216 leaders			0
intriguingly , president @entity295 offered to ‘ provide assistance ’ to the investigation in @entity4 before it was known that there was a @entity216 link to the bombing			0
‘ fighting terrorism is more important than political posturing , ’ said a @entity22 source yesterday			0
‘ if we work together properly and deeply , we have much more chance of defeating those who want to maim and kill			0

@entity2 was ejected from his @entity49 , @entity131 mosque three months ago
also revealed today that he had row with imam who said @entity26 could celebrate @entity28 holidays like @entity30 and @entity29
