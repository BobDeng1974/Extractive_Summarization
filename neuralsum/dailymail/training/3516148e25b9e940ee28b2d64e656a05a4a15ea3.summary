by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 08:16 est , 20 october 2012 a businessman who marched a thieving employee to a police station with a sign around his neck says his actions have left him on the verge of bankruptcy and cost him his relationship and home			2
@entity12 , 48 , frogmarched @entity13 through a town centre after he discovered the sub-contractor had written an £ 845 company cheque to himself			1
mr @entity12 was later arrested for false imprisonment – which carries a maximum life sentence – although the case was dropped			1
@entity12 , 48 , made @entity13 walk through the streets of @entity21 , in @entity22 , to humiliate him because @entity13 had written and cashed a cheque to himself for £ 845 from the company but his ‘ victim ’ received only a police caution and went on to launch a civil case against @entity27 agreed to pay £ 5,000 in an out - of - court settlement but has been told he has to pay £ 40,000 solicitors ’ fees on top			1
the stress of the case led to the collapse of his relationship with long - term partner @entity38 , 48 , who was recovering from a double mastectomy after developing breast cancer			2
the couple sold their home at @entity44 , near @entity45 in @entity22 but @entity46 , who put up most of the money for the three - bedroom house , was left with negative equity			2
mr @entity12 said he is now paying her £ 400 a month to make up the shortfall			1
‘ i am disgusted at the whole thing			0
the legal system is wrong , ’ flooring company boss mr @entity12 told the @entity54 yesterday			1
‘ i do n’t think mr @entity13 should have had the right to sue me			1
i was the one who was wronged in the first place but it is me who is suffering			0
‘ yes , i took him to the police station , i hold my hands up to that			0
but it has cost me everything			0
’ mr @entity12 provoked a wave of public support for his actions when he subjected @entity13 to the 350 yard walk of shame through @entity21 , @entity22 , in september 2008			1
around his neck on a piece of cardboard was the message : ‘ thief			0
am on my way to police station			0
’ mr @entity12 is now calling on the government to ban criminals from benefitting financially in the civil courts but the decision to make an example of him backfired when he and three colleagues found they were facing a range of charges including false imprisonment			1
the criminal charges were eventually dropped but @entity13 – who claimed he was only taking wages he was owed – lodged a case for £ 40,000 damages , saying the embarrassment of being paraded had left him too traumatised to work for two years			1
he also claimed he had feared for his life after he was allegedly tied up and bundled into a van before walking the last stretch of the journey to the police station			0
mr @entity12 , who has two grown - up daughters from a previous relationship , agreed to pay £ 5,000 compensation but was horrified by the £ 35,000 legal bill that came with it			1
‘ a barrister heard about my case and worked on my behalf for free			0
he got £ 9,000 taken off the bill in 2009 , ’ he said			1
‘ i still could n’t afford to pay that because business has been tight			1
now , after a lot of wrangling , the bill has gone back up to £ 40,000 because they are charging interest			2
‘ i had no option but to agree to this last week			0
they wanted a £ 10,000 lump sum and £ 1,000 a month but finally agreed to £ 5,000 and £ 500 per month			2
‘ it will probably bankrupt me , to be honest			0
what happened did n’t affect my business – every single customer supported me			0
‘ but the recession hit them and that hit my business			0
i used to turn over £ 300 - 400,000 a year but last year that was down to around £ 75,000 and my profit is normally 25 per cent of that net			2
‘ on top of that , my relationship with @entity38 broke down in may last year			0
it was getting too tough for her			0
‘ she was left with negative equity after the house was sold for about £ 300,000 , so i am helping her out			2
’ miss @entity38 lived in a rented house after selling her home and has now moved in with a new partner			0
the gp ’s receptionist said : ‘ @entity12 overstepped the mark but he did n’t deserve to lose everything			1
it ’s wrong that a criminal has been able to claim compensation			2
’ @entity21 @entity138 mp @entity137 said : ‘ this case has clearly had a devastating impact upon mr @entity12 and that is just dreadful			1
common sense should have prevailed in the way it was handled in terms of the criminal process and civil complaint			0
’ @entity13 , 43 , who moved from @entity149 to @entity150 , after receiving the caution , was unavailable to comment yesterday .			1
