by @entity0 published : 14:53 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 14:53 est , 6 november 2013 critique : @entity3 spokesman @entity2 , pictured in 2011 , warned that the new plans pose a security risk new government plans to cut ‘ red tape ’ for private - hire business jets and light aircraft could leave a gaping hole in @entity12 ’s border security which ‘ would - be terrorists and criminals ’ could exploit , @entity6 said today			1
it came after the government and @entity18 ( @entity18 ) announced plans in a consultation ‘ to strip away unnecessary bureaucracy for the @entity12 general aviation sector ’			1
this general aviation sector includes flights other than commercial scheduled air services and is worth around £ 1.4bn to the @entity12 economy and supports up to 50,000 jobs			2
most of the world ’s air traffic falls into this category , from gliders to corporate flights			0
it also includes proposals to deregulate use of single - seat microlight aeroplanes			2
aviation minister @entity37 said : ‘ general aviation is an extremely important sector of @entity12 civil aviation and it is right that we do everything possible to enable it to thrive			2
that includes making sure that , where appropriate , we ease the burden on what are often smaller operators and businesses who find navigating a complex regulatory framework particularly challenging			0
’ but @entity6 ’s @entity3 aviation spokesman @entity2 , mp for @entity53 said the @entity7 documents and ministerial statements announcing the cutting of red - tape fail to address security or the risk of terrorist and criminal exploitation			1
he said : ‘ the government claims they want to cut red tape but if their complacency on security issues is n’t addressed they ’re in danger of creating a one - stop green light open - skies policy that criminals and potential terrorists could exploit			1
’ he added : ‘ it ’s frankly astonishing – given the level of concern about potential soft entry for would - be terrorists or criminals in the @entity12 – and with thousands of small planes and hundreds of landing sites across the country where they may land – that the @entity79 did n’t see fit to include such considerations in laying out a programme that will put heavy emphasis on self - regulation			1
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ it is extremely concerning that nowhere is there any focus or reference to security considerations that should be the top priority in any deregulation process			2
flying high : the new plans by the government and @entity18 ( @entity18 ) will make it easier for private jets and light aircrafts to travel to and from @entity12 ‘ the @entity18 document included eight themes on which the government sought views – security concerns or implications do not figure in any of them			1
’ the @entity79 said mr @entity2 ’s fears appeared to be based on ‘ a misunderstanding of the nature of this consultation			0
’ improving : aviation minister @entity37 wants to lighten the load for private flyers but the @entity6 mp said that only last month the director general of the @entity110 admitted to @entity112 ’s @entity111 that some arrivals on small planes are not checked by his officers : ‘ he told the committee that he has no accurate figures available on the number of such flights , and that there is no system to synchronise with the national air traffic system to supervise these flights into the @entity12			1
‘ the @entity6 aviation spokesman added : ‘ we need urgent answers as to whether the @entity110 or other security organisations were consulted or responded			1
and if not , why not			0
‘ we will be raising these issues urgently with the @entity79 and the @entity18 and demanding that these concerns are given a central role as this process is rolled forwards ’			0
but a @entity79 spokesman said : ‘ this appears to be a misunderstanding of the nature of this consultation , which was about stripping the general aviation sector of unnecessary red tape			1
‘ the next stage is for industry to come forward with their thoughts and ideas on what areas they would like the new dedicated panel within the @entity18 to look at			0
we have no pre-conceived views on what the panel might recommend and do not want to place unnecessary constraints on it other than providing a final report by the end of april next year			0
’ minister without portfolio @entity153 said : ‘ the measures we are announcing today will ensure that the regulatory framework is proportionate – deregulating completely wherever possible , and minimising regulation where it is still necessary			0
‘ this will ensure that we have effective safety regulation while supporting the sector to grow			0
this is in line with both the government ’s deregulation commitment and also its wider drive for growth in the economy			0

plans to ease bureaucracy for private aviation could be security risk
cutting red tape ' would open for would - be terrorists and criminals ’
