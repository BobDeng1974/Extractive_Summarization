within six months she had been hospitalised and at her lowest point , weighing just four stone , doctors gave her just 48 - hours to live			1
for the next six years , @entity7 was so gripped by anorexia she allowed herself just water and peas to survive - and did excessive numbers of star jumps to lose more weight			1
