mrs @entity7 , a former school cleaner , suffers from musical hallucination , also called musical tinnitus			1

according to the @entity61 , musical hallucination ( mh ) , also known as musical tinnitus , is the experience of hearing music when none is being played			2
hearing sound that no - one else can hear is quite common , but the experience is normally of a simple sound such as a buzzing , ringing , or sizzling : this is known as tinnitus			2
in a small number of people however , these experiences can be more complex and emotive , and music can be heard			0
musical hallucination , also known as musical tinnitus , is the experience of hearing music when none is being played ( file picture ) although anyone can experience @entity79 , it is more common in women than in men , as well as in those over 60 years of age			1
individuals who live alone , and those with hearing loss are also more likely to experience @entity79			0
some people with @entity79 are worried that it might represent a mental health condition , such as schizophrenia			0
although in schizophrenia it is common to hear voices , it is in fact very rare to experience @entity79 and there is thought to be no connection between the two conditions			2
